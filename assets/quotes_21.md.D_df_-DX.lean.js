In 1945 he was chosen personally by Lt. Col. Henry Mucci to plan the rescue at the Cabanatuan POW camp in the Philippines. Personal life Prince was born in Seattle, Washington on November 7, 1919 and grew up in the Madrona neighborhood. He graduated from Garfield High School and Stanford University, studying history and economics. He was initiated in Sigma Chi fraternity at Stanford. Prince joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and was commissioned as a Second lieutenant in 1941. On January 31, 1942, he married Barbara Harrison at Seattle's Episcopal Church of the Epiphany. Only a few months afterwards, Prince was sent to New Guinea to fight in the war against the Imperial Japanese Army. The fighting in New Guinea ended a week before his group arrived. Shortly afterwards, the US Army created the 6th Ranger Battalion with Lt. Colonel Mucci commanding. In January 1945, news spread of the \\"Kill-All\\" policy of the Japanese. Mucci was quickly ordered to form a team to rescue prisoners at the Cabanatuan camp. After the successful raid in 1945, Prince left the Army as a Major the day before Thanksgiving 1946. Prince reunited with his wife and raised two sons. He settled in Wenatchee and ran an apple business.Robert Prince, U.S. Army Ranger, 1919‚Äì2009 In his later years, he retired in Kirkland, WA, and, after the death of his wife, he moved to Port Townsend, WA to be closer to his son. Raid at Cabanatuan Prince was mainly involved with the planning of the raid. He had to hastily create a plan using a low level of intelligence of the area. Prince built his plan around his two best weapons; surprise and confusion. One of his primary concerns was the flatness of the countryside, since the Rangers would have to crawl across an open field without being seen by the guards. At the suggestion of Juan Pajota, a Filipino guerrilla, Mucci arranged for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) to have a P-61 Black Widow night fighter buzz the camp while the men made their way across the field. It proved to be the biggest factor in achieving the element of surprise.American Experience  Bataan Rescue  People & Events Prince was personally responsible for the rescue of approximately 500+ Bataan Death March survivors through his rescue plan and direct actions. The principles of this plan are still taught today at the United States Military Academy.

In the late 1990s, he was added to the Army Ranger Hall of Fame.Leader of WWII's 'Great Raid' looks back at real-life POW rescue The Raid at Cabanatuan was depicted in the 1945 film Back to Bataan and the 2005 film The Great Raid that featured actor James Franco playing Prince.

They are built into stone pillars or the walls of buildings and are never found free-standing. This is because they are made largely from wood. They were nearly all made by the now-defunct company of James Ludlow & Son of Birmingham, whose name they take. Similar designs exist as historical artefacts in certain Commonwealth countries. Ludlow style boxes have been in use since 1885 and were in continuous manufacture until 1965. According to the Letter Box Study Group (LBSG), there are more than 450 locations in the UK and Republic of Ireland where Ludlow post boxes are in use, stored or preserved. As Royal Mail estimates that there are over 100,000 post boxes in the UK, the Ludlow style boxes represent a very small group of nonetheless important designs.BBC News: Campaign to preserve red post boxes (retrieved 23 March 2007) Early history The earliest use of a Ludlow style box came in 1885, but the very first boxes in the style were made by the Eagle Range and Foundry Company or E.R. Cole & Co and not by James Ludlow & Son. They are grouped together under the generic term \\"Ludlow boxes\\" as those made by James Ludlow & Son are by far the most prevalent. According to LBSG records only two E.R. Cole boxes survive in service in the UK and only a handful of Eagle Range and Foundry boxes. Construction Ludlow boxes are special because unlike traditional cast iron post boxes, they are made largely of wood. There are two standard sizes, small and large. The construction of both is a simple rustic pine box which may have doors at the front only or at front and back. In the smaller style the front door is surrounded by a cast iron decorative beading and surmounted by a cast aperture or mouth-piece which bears the cypher of the reigning British monarch at the time of supply. Ludlow boxes can hence be found bearing the cyphers of Queen Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II. Below the aperture casting is a wooden door which is faced with thin sheet steel at the top and a decorative enamel plate at the bottom. The plate normally bears the Royal Cypher and the wording \\"POST OFFICE LETTER BOX\\". It may also contain a recessed collection time plate and a \\"Next collection\\" tablet. It will normally be fitted with a brass five-lever Chubb lock on the inside and may have a lock escutcheon on the outside. Until 1952 the larger style had no top casting, the area being covered by an enamel decorative plate which itself has an aperture through the middle. In this case the longer door may have a collection plate and tablet holder and again will carry a Chubb lock and may be fitted with an escutcheon. From 1952 however, the design was modified so that the casting from the smaller style box could be used instead of the enamel plate. It was uniform with the smaller style and both of these later EIIR boxes carry a cast plaque on the lower door reading \\"Post Office\\". In Scotland, this style of box featured apertures showing the Crown of Scotland. General use Ludlow boxes were introduced because, until 1910, sub- postmasters were responsible for the provision of secure posting facilities in their post offices. As the traditional cast iron boxes were heavy and expensive, James Ludlow & Son introduced a range of much cheaper boxes which they could supply at a competitive price to sub-postmasters. They were also to be seen in large country houses, public buildings and hotels. James Ludlow manufactured the boxes in various styles and produced colour leaflets describing the boxes. At their height, it is estimated that there were some 5,000‚Äì7,000 Ludlow boxes in use in the UK. As the network of post offices has contracted, many of these have been withdrawn from service and removed until today there are around 450 left.

History  Originally, the French Camp land was part of the San Juan Ranch. Over time, The San Juan Ranch was split into a number of parcels including the French Camp area, which became a part of the Camatta Ranch. The Miller family purchased The Camatta Ranch property in 1968, believing that it could be developed to various crops including wine grapes. They leased parts of it out for a few years while they gathered information as to climate, soils, and water for irrigation. Initially, were planted to wine grapes in 1973. The French Camp operation is a team effort among the people who have grown the grapes, those that have managed its business affairs, those that have sold the production (whether it was grapes or cuttings), and those that have done strategic planning for future growth. These team members include Hank Ashby, Vineyard Manager, Debbie Strange, the Office Manager, James Ontiveros, grape salesman, members of the Miller family, who own French Camp Vineyards, and Chon. Working together, this group has grown French Camp to over .  Vineyard mechanization  In cooperation with the University of Arkansas, Dr. Justin Morris (Director of Food Science & Engineering at U of A), and OXBO International, Hank Ashby, Vineyard Manager for French Camp Vineyards has adopted a new method for producing a better balanced and consistent crop. The Morris-Oldridge canopy management system achieves yields within 10% of the yield goal. By using mechanization for pruning, shoot thinning, and fruit thinning, crop levels can be adjusted several times during the growing season. This practice would be cost prohibitive if not for mechanization. In the average vineyard, annual yield can very as much as 50% year to year, making it very difficult to predict budgetary and wine productions numbers. Moreover, in conjunction with Paso Robles Wine Services, French Camp has conducted trials demonstrating better quality fruit production as a result of the balanced cropping technique when compared against hand farmed fruit in many cases.

A Democrat, in 1983 Miller became the first African-American woman elected to the state house, where she served for four years before winning election to the state Senate, where she consistently won re-election until her death in office. Miller taught in the Norfolk Public schools, and later taught early and childhood education at one of her alma maters, which had become Norfolk State University during her lifetime.  Early life and education  Born on Independence Day, 1934 in Edenton, North Carolina, Yvonne Bond was the eldest of what became thirteen children born to John T. and Pency C. Bond. Her family moved to Norfolk, where she attended local public schools, which were then segregated by state law. After graduation, Bond attended the all-black Norfolk Division of Virginia State College, a historically black college (now Norfolk State University), for two years. In 1956, she earned a B.S. degree from Virginia State College in Petersburg (also a historically black college and which became Virginia State University). While in college, Bond became a lifetime member of Zeta Phi Beta. In 1962 Miller earned a M.A. degree from the Teachers College of Columbia University and in 1973 she earned a Ph.D in education from the University of Pittsburgh. Educator After earning her undergraduate degree (and while pursuing her graduate degrees), Bond taught for twelve years in the Norfolk Public Schools, at first at Young's Park elementary school. They had been segregated by state law since the 19th century and through her childhood. The U.S. Supreme Court had just issued the decisions in Brown v. Board of Education, which required desegregation of public schools, but in Virginia the dominant Byrd Organization reacted with Massive Resistance. Although the Norfolk public schools (and Arlington public schools in northern Virginia) preferred to respond to lawsuits by the NAACP by desegregating, successive governors and the white-dominated Virginia general assembly enacted laws which permitted the governor to close schools in any district that voluntarily desegregated. Only after both a three-judge federal panel and the Virginia Supreme Court, both on the Lee-Jackson Day state holiday issued decisions declaring those laws unconstitutional did Virginia governor J. Lindsay Almond allow the Norfolk and Arlington public schools to desegregate, in both cases peaceably and pursuant to federal court orders. That proved a formative experience, and ultimately launched Bond's political career discussed below. Bond joined the education faculty at Norfolk State, where she taught for 31 years. She became a professor and head of the Department of Early Childhood/Elementary Education, before retiring in 1999 and assuming emeritus status. Miller was also a life member of National Education Association, served on the boards of the National Alliance of Black School Educators (and was a life member) and Virginia Association for Early Childhood Education, and was active in the Association of University Women, American Association of University Professors (board member).House biography Bond also hosted a public affairs radio show in Norfolk for many years. Political career Miller began to get involved in politics, joining the Democratic Party, although it had long been dominated statewide by the Byrd Organization. Her concerns for education and minority rights made her an \\"outspoken advocate for Virginia‚Äôs poor and minorities in the General Assembly\\".\\"Yvonne B. Miller, first African American woman in Va. legislature, dies at 77\\", Washington Post She would later be called the conscience of the Democratic caucus. In 2010 Sen. Miller and Sen. Louise Lucas succeeded in having Virginia recognize the Nottoway as among the state's remaining Native American tribes. In 2012, Miller spoke out against efforts by the state legislature to require voters to bring new identification documents to polling places, likening it to Jim Crow-era requirements intended to suppress black voting. In 1983, Miller became the first black woman to be elected to the Virginia House of Delegateshttps://vig.coopercenter.org/sites/vig/files/Virginia_News_Letter_1988_Vol._64_No._4.pdf She won re-election and served two terms (from 1984‚Äì88). In 1987 Miller ran and was elected to her first four-year term in the Senate of Virginia. The first African-American woman in Virginia to serve in each house, she was consistently re-elected to the Senate (last facing an opponent in 1995) and died in office. Miller most recently represented the 5th state senate district, which since 1971 and a redistricting, has been made up of parts of the independent cities of Norfolk, Chesapeake and Virginia Beach.Senate of Virginia bio At the time of her death, Miller was the longest-serving woman in the Virginia Senate, ranking 4th in overall seniority. She gained a seat on the budget-writing Finance Committee. Due to repeated re-election, she gained seniority and in 1996, she became the first woman to chair a Senate committee, gaining the chair of the Transportation Committee. Personal life Miller married and took her husband's surname. She was a lifetime member and an Evangelist Missionary in the Church Of God In Christ, Inc., and a lifetime member of the NAACP. Death and legacy On July 3, 2012, Miller died in her Norfolk home from stomach cancer, one day shy of her 78th birthday. She was named among the African American Trailblazers in Virginia History, and in 2013 Gov. McDonnell consolidated the academic campuses at correctional centers operated by the state's Division of Juvenile Justice and renamed them in her honor. The Virginia Poverty Law Center also in 2014 won an award named to honor Sen. Miller. Norfolk State University also established an award to honor her service.

Function  Autotaxin, also known as ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (NPP2 or ENPP2), is a secreted enzyme important for generating the lipid signaling molecule lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Autotaxin has lysophospholipase D activity that converts lysophosphatidylcholine into LPA. Autotaxin was originally identified as a tumor cell-motility-stimulating factor; later it was shown to be LPA (which signals through lysophospholipid receptors), the lipid product of the reaction catalyzed by autotaxin, which is responsible for its effects on cell- proliferation. The protein encoded by this gene functions as a phosphodiesterase. Autotaxin is secreted and further processed to make the biologically active form. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified. Autotaxin is able to cleave the phosphodiester bond between the Œ± and the Œ≤ position of triphosphate nucleotides, acting as an ectonucleotide phosphodiesterase producing pyrophosphate, as most members of the ENPP family. Importantly, autotaxin also acts as phospholipase, catalyzing the removal of the head group of various lysolipids. The physiological function of autotaxin is the production of the signalling lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in extracellular fluids. LPA evokes growth factor- like responses including stimulation of cell proliferation and chemotaxis. This gene product stimulates the motility of tumor cells, has angiogenic properties, and its expression is up-regulated in several kinds of tumours. Also, autotaxin and LPA are involved in numerous inflammatory-driven diseases such as asthma and arthritis. Physiologically, LPA helps promote wound healing responses to tissue damage. Under normal circumstances, LPA negatively regulates autotaxin transcription, but in the context of wound repair, cytokines induce autotaxin expression to increase overall LPA concentrations. It has been shown that autotaxin's function can be regulated at its allosteric site by certain steroids, namely bile acids, or by its own product, lysophosphatidic acid.  As a drug target  Various small molecule inhibitors of autotaxin have been developed for clinical applications. A specific inhibitor against idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis showed promising results in a phase II trial that ended in May 2018. A DNA aptamer inhibitor of Autotaxin has also been described.  Structure  The crystal structures rat and mouse autotaxin have been solved. In each case, the apo structure have been solved along with product or inhibitor bound complexes. Both proteins consist of 4 domains, 2 N-terminal somatomedin-B-like (SMB) domains which may be involved in cell-surface localisation. The catalytic domain follows and contains a deep hydrophobic pocket in which the lipid substrate binds. At the C-terminus is the inactive nuclease domain which may function to aid protein stability.

Early Soviet experiments  Arguably the first attempt to construct a language for interplanetary communication was the AO language created by the anarchist philosopher Wolf Gordin (brother of Abba Gordin) in his books Grammar of the Language of the Mankind AO (1920) and Grammar of the Language AO (1924),Wolf Gordin, Grammatika logicheskogo yazyka AO [Grammar of the Language AO (1924) (Russian)] was presented as a language for interplanetary communication at the First International Exhibition of Interplanetary Machines and Mechanisms (dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the 70th anniversary of the birth of Tsiolkovsky) in Moscow, 1927. The declared goal of Gordin was to construct a language which would be non-\\"fetishizing\\", non-\\"sociomorphic\\", non-gender based and non- classist. The design of the language was inspired by Russian Futurist poetry, the Gordin brothers' pan-anarchist philosophy, and Tsiolkovsky's early remarks on possible cosmic messaging (which were in accord with Hans Freudenthal's later insights). Kuznecov S. Linguistica cosmica: La naissance du paradigme cosmique // Une famili√®re √©tranget√©: La linguistique russe et sovi√©tique. Paris, 1995 (Histoire √âpist√©mologie Langage. 17/11 (Tome XVII ‚Äì fascicule 2)), pp. 211‚Äì234. However, Sergei N. Kuznetsov notes that \\"Gordin nowhere defines his language as intended for space use,\\" and that \\"in none of his works does he deal with problems of space communication, only mentioning 'Interplanetary Communication' in passing among other technical areas.\\" (The updated version of Kuznetsov's 1995 French-language article) Freudenthal's LINCOS An integral part of the SETI project in general is research in the field of the construction of messages for extraterrestrial intelligence, possibly to be transmitted into space from Earth. As far as such messages are based on linguistic principles, the research can be considered to belong to astrolinguistics. The first proposal in this field was put forward by the mathematician Hans Freudenthal at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, in 1960 ‚Äì around the time of the first SETI effort at Greenbank in the US. Freudenthal conceived a complete Lingua Cosmica. His book LINCOS: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse seems at first sight non- linguistic, because mathematical concepts are the core of the language. The concepts are, however, introduced in conversations between persons (Homo sapiens), de facto by linguistic means. This is witnessed by the innovative examples presented. The book set a landmark in astrolinguistics. This was witnessed by Bruno Bassi's review years later. Bassi noted: ‚ÄúLINCOS is there. In spite of its somewhat ephemeral 'cosmic intercourse' purpose it remains a fascinating linguistic and educational construction, deserving existence as another Toy of Man's Designing‚Äù. Freudenthal eventually had lost interest in creating further work altogether because of rising issues in applying LINCOS \\"for [anything] other than mathematical contents due to the potential different sociological aspects of alien receivers\\". Ollongren's LINCOS The concept astrolinguistics in scientific research was coined as such, also with a view towards message construction for ETI, in 2013 in the monograph Astrolinguistics: Design of a Linguistic System for Interstellar Communication Based on Logic, written by the astronomer and computer scientist Alexander Ollongren, University of Leiden, The Netherlands. This book presents a new Lingua Cosmica totally different from Freudenthal's design. It describes the way the logic of situations in human societies can be formulated in the lingua, also named LINCOS. This astrolinguistic system, also designed for use in interstellar communication, is based on modern constructive logic ‚Äì which assures that all expressions are verifiable. At a deeper, more fundamental level, however, astrolinguistics is concerned with the question whether linguistic universalia can be identified which are potentially useful in communication across interstellar distances between intelligence species. In the view of the new LINCOS these might be certain logic descriptions of specific situations and relations (possibly in an Aristotelian sense).

Early life  John Struthers was born in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire on 18 July 1776, the son of a shoemaker. Initially educated at home, he was sent to the local school at eight and although the local teacher saw his potential, the family circumstances meant that at the age of nine he was working as a cow-herd. He eventually became a farm labourer and took various positions until he learnt the art of making fine shoes at the prestigious Glasgow firm of Jenkin and Smith in 1793. Iniatally he made his shoes from his home in Anderson, near Glasgow and took the completed shoes in once a fortnight. In 1798 he was married and had a pretty cottage in the village. In 1801, he decided to publish privately a small book of poems. After publication he seems to have got very embarrassed and had all the copies that had not found owners destroyed. He described his feelings about this event ‚Äì \\"Ignorant of printing and still more of publishing, I had not the common sense to consult anyone upon the subject\\".  Poor Man's Sabbath  Sometime around 1803 he wrote 'A Poor Man's Sabbath', but anxious not to publish hastily again he lay around for a year. In 1804, a couple of acquaintances told him that they were anxious to see the poem in print. He had the poem printed off by Mr William Lang who had it \\"beautifully and correctly printed on a stout and fine foolscap extending to 32 pages having neither preface or note\\". The price of the printing was 4¬Ωd per copy and Lang thought he could ask no more than 6d a copy. So Struthers left the printers \\"With the whole edition formed into a small parcel, which I carried below my arm\\". His first port of call was a bookseller he had known for some time called Brash. Mr Brash read the first few verses, liked it and bought 2 dozen copies. He suggested another Glasgow bookseller, Mr Ogle who might also be interested. Struthers took the poem to that bookseller but he was rude and insulting about the work, hardly bothering to read it. Despite this he bought 6 copies and by selling another 6 to shoemakers on his way home, he had sold 3 dozen by the end of the day. 10 days later when he was looking in Ogle's window, he was beckoned inside, where Mr Ogle's attitude had taken on a great change. He asked whether there were any copies left and offered to take the whole edition at 6d a time. He would also take any unsold stock off any other booksellers. The deal was done, and as Brash was the only other to hold the book, he went to ask after any unsold copies. Mr Brash was most amused at Ogles antics and the naivety of the author. He brought out an article from an Edinburgh periodical the previous week that gave the poem a glowing review. In 1808, Struthers was visited in his house by his childhood teacher, Joanna Baillie, who suggested a 3rd edition printed in a better style than the previous 2 editions. She asked him to add some stanza's. a preface and some additional poems. Through Walter Scott they got an agreement from Archibald Constable for ¬£30 to be paid for an edition of 1000 copies.  Peasant's Death  In 1806 he finished 'The Peasant's Death', which was intended as a sequel to 'The Poor Man's Sabbath'. It was printed again for Mr Ogle and on the same terms as before, which means that Struthers would make very little money from the book. In 1808, he was in Edinburgh and for the first time met Sir Walter Scott. Although he felt that most of the thanks for the printing of the 3rd edition of 'The Poor Man's Sabbath' was due to Joanna Baillie, it was good manners to go and thank Scott for the effort that he had made on his behalf, and for getting him a generous fee. They got on well and would go on meeting when Struthers went into Edinburgh, but he rejected the many invitations to visit Ashestiel or later Abbotsford. In 1809 he found himself out of the job he had kept for a number of years. These years were times of much change and unrest and this had been especially true in the shoemaking trade. There had been a number of strikes by jobbing shoemakers, that is those who were paid a salary. Despite the exhortations of the organizers, Struthers had always refused to join the strikes. In 1809 the firm at which he worked entered into a closed shop agreement with the union. Struthers was totally opposed to Union activity and there was no way he was going to join, so he was forced to leave. His only alternative was to work on his own from home in his small house. He had always been opposed to self-employment, but now he had no choice. After a year he took a shop, but a year later he had given that up commenting \\"the experience of what it is to keep an open door, I thought rather dear\\".  Later work  In 1811 he completed 'A Winters Day', which was printed privately with some success and in 1816 he wrote 'An Essay on the State of the Labouring Poor'. The work caused considerable correspondence for Struthers. One of the correspondents was Mr Archibald Fullarton of the firm Khull, Blackie & Co who asked his permission to print a cheap edition for circulation among that class of the community for whose benefit it was more immediately intended. The pamphlet was reduced from 18d to a groat. For the working man however the work held no charms. In 1818 'The Plough' was printed by Robert Chapman and was well received by the public. He also produced a volume of poems by William Muir, of which he edited and added a preface and saw through the press. The work died without a trace. Fullarton asked Struthers to edit a collection of songs. He did this reluctantly, thinking himself unqualified for the job. The result was 'The Harp of Caledonia' which came out in 3 volumes in 1819. It included songs by Sir Walter Scott and Joanna Baillie. In 1819 he gave up shoemaking and joined the firm of Khull, Blackie and Co. His jobs were of a most general kind including a little proof reading or editing. At the request of Fullarton he wrote 'The History of Scotland from the Union to 1827'. He intended to add a third volume, but this was never finished. He worked for 18 months on Scottish biographies, many of which appeared in Chambers 'Eminent Scotsmen'. In 1829 the firm of Khull and Blackie was broken up and Struthers found himself without employment. In 1832 took a post as librarian at Stirling's Public Library in Glasgow, a post he held for another thirteen years. He died on 30 July 1853.  Works  = Poetry = * Poems on various subjects 1801.

Havy managed the Quebec business of the French shipping firm Dugard et Cie. While the company's Quebec activities were modest when Havy first established the office in 1732, by 1741 he was handling a full fifth of the colony's imports. They oversaw the construction of six ships for the company. His assistant was his cousin Jean Lefebvre, with whom he formed a partnership to pursue other business opportunities while retaining their positions at Dugard et Cie. Eventually, Dugard et Cie's ships were lost to privateers or storms and the firm withdrew from Canada. Lefebvre and Havy's business grew steadily, as they personally handled cargos and eventually came to own a small ship of their own, the Parfaite Union. They experienced a setback when they invested in a sealing station in Labrador with Louis Bazil and Louis Fornel, and retained their interest in it until the 1745 capture of the Fortress of Louisbourg by Anglo-Americans cut them off from it. They lost about a third of their original 100,000 livre investment. In 1756, partly out of a desire to marry (as a Huguenot, he could not do so in Quebec) and partly motivated by the looming threat of the Seven Years' War, Havy returned to France to oversee the transfer of as much of the business as possible there. When the British captured Quebec in 1759 much of his and Lefebvre's assets in New France ‚Äì in mortgages, Canadian paper money, and bills of exchange ‚Äì were declared worthless by the new government.

Willard House, in the 400 block of Somonauk Street is one of numerous 19th-century houses in the historic district. The house was built by Sycamore mason Hosea Willard in 1867. The Willard House is one of the Sycamore Historic District houses to feature the distinctive Jerkin roof, basically a combination of the simple gable roof and the hipped roof. Both the main gables and the smaller gables over the second floor windows contain this roof element. On the home's south facade a prominent oriel is set into the first floor. Willard was a prominent Sycamore mason and builder. He was responsible for the construction of several of the historic district's other notable buildings, including the St. Peter's Episcopal Church as well as the Old Congregational Church (now Sycamore Baptist Church). Willard arrived in Sycamore in 1843, a time when the city had just 18 homes. =J.H. Rogers House= J.H. Rogers settled in Sycamore in 1858. He was a highly respected dry goods merchant and associate of George R. Wild. Wild's House is another of the Sycamore Historic District's notable homes.

Rogers/Bettis House= Rogers-Bettis House The J.H. Rogers/Bettis House, also known as the John Gathercoal House, is located in the 500 block of Main Street. The house began its existence in 1863 attached to the Charles A. Bishop House, which currently stands next door to the Bettis House. In 1887 the Bishop house was moved, by mule, from its original location. That property became the site for the c. 1890 J.H. Rogers House. When the Bishop House was moved the Rogers- Bettis House was split off from it and planted next door. The property the house stands on today was part of the original purchased by Ellzey P.

Bettis purchased the house. =Stephens House= The Stephens House, in the 800 block of Somonauk Street, is an Italianate structure and considered to be architecturally significant in a historic district where 75% of the buildings are contributing properties to the historic integrity of the district. =Wally Thurow House= Thurow House. The Wally Thurow House is a 1917 American Foursquare with a brick exterior and oak interiors. The Four Square style was a reaction to the complexity and excess found in Victorian and Revival style homes that were popular in the later half of the 19th century. Incorporating elements of the Prairie School, pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright, and American Craftsman styles the two-and-a-half-story house exhibits the classic boxy shape, a mostly hipped roof, and a central dormer. The front facade is dominated by a brick porch supported by two large pillars.Interior features include prairie art glass, built-in cabinetry, and Craftsman style woodwork.Thurow House, Photograph on Wikimedia Commons.

The events surrounding the founding of the Sycamore Pumpkin Festival occurred at the house in 1956. Wally \\"Mr. Pumpkin\\" Thurow is considered the founder of the Sycamore Pumpkin Festival. The festival essentially started as Thurow's personal Halloween celebration; he filled his lawn with decorated pumpkins.

Pet Force is a series of books for young readers. It is a spin-off of Garfield, in which the main animal characters of the comic series are portrayed as comic book superheroes. The action takes place on planet Polyester. 20th Century Fox has released a computer-animated direct-to-video film Garfield's Pet Force based on the series.  Story  In another universe, one which exists parallel to Garfield's own, a team of five superheroes known as \\"Pet Force\\" serve Emperor Jon as protectors of his throne. Ruling the galaxy from the planet Polyester, Jon's reign is constantly opposed by the evil Vetvix. When Vetvix uses a new weapon and strips Pet Force of their powers, and sends them to a ghostly dimension where they will be trapped forever, Jon is forced to have his right- hand man, Sorcerer Binky, use a dimensional portal to find five alternate versions of the heroes to take their place. In Garfield's universe, Pet Force is a best-selling comic book, and when Nermal buys the limited-edition 100th issue, it becomes a portal through which they are pulled into the alternate universe, becoming the new Pet Force. Although they return to their own universe after the initial adventure, they subsequently return to fight Vetvix and other evils when needed.

Studios Garfield comic books. Characters The characters in Pet Force include characters from the original Garfield universe, as well as some entirely new characters. =Heroes= Garzooka Garzooka is the superhero version of Garfield and the leader of Pet Force. Garzooka's abilities are gamma-radiated hairballs, superhuman strength, and razor-sharp claws in his right hand that can rend solid steel. While the original Garzooka was heroic and a born leader, the Garzooka created from Garfield is lazy and gluttonous, though he still focuses on the task at hand. Odious Odious is the superhero version of Odie and the dumbest of the Pet Force. Odious, like his normal comic counterpart Odie, does not talk. He drools, licks, and barks, which is how he acts in the original Garfield comics. Odious' abilities are a \\"super-stretchy stun tongue\\" that causes a total mental meltdown in anyone he uses it against, super-slippery saliva, and superhuman strength. Abnermal Abnermal is the superhero version of Nermal. Unlike the rest of the team, Abnermal quickly takes to his superpowers and is overjoyed to be a hero. Abnermal's abilities include his Pester Power, the ability to create force fields, and a body temperature of absolute zero that allows him to freeze anything he touches and project ice blasts. In the movie, he is given super speed. Starlena Starlena is the superhero version of Arlene. Starlena's abilities are a siren song that puts anyone who hears it into a deep trance, to which only Garzooka, Odious and the Lethal Lizard member Snake are immune, and the ability to fly. In the movie, she is granted the power to freeze enemies with her eyes. Compooky Compooky, half teddy bear, half robot, is a superhero version of Garfield's teddy bear, Pooky. Despite being an inanimate teddy bear in Garfield's universe, in the alternate universe Compooky can speak and is furthermore highly intelligent. Having no real combat abilities, he normally stays on board their ship while the others deal with the crisis. He does not exist in the movie version of Pet Force. He frequently makes small appearances in the comic series; likewise he is not a member of the team. =Villains= Vetvix A beautiful and powerful sorceress, Vetvix is the main villain of the Pet Force, an evil veterinarian. The source of her evil is a power crystal on her headband. Vetvix's main source of minions is an animal-splicing machine that allows her to mix and match parts from other animals and create new creatures that are entirely under her control. She is also highly skilled with magic and genetics. She is the opposite of Dr. Liz. Emperor Jon might have strong feelings for her. K-Niner K-Niner is a Doberman with enhanced intelligence and superhuman strength, as well as a British accent and demeanor. Vetvix created a brain-booster that he then used to increase the intelligence of various other dogs, and gave those dogs mind-controlling collars to place on their owners and make them think they were dogs. Eventually, he was defeated by Pet Force and transformed back into a regular Doberman. The Space Pie-Rat A large rat with a monstrous appetite, he is Vetvix's main minion until he rebels against her and is defeated. He steals food from any planet he visits and wears a fake pegleg and an eyepatch, despite having both eyes; he just likes the look. When he is successfully manipulated by Vetvix into repairing her power crystal for her, she punishes him for his betrayal by teleporting him into the core of an asteroid. The Mutanator A monster created by Vetvix from the pieces of Pet Force minus Garzooka, the Mutanator possessed all the powers of the original four members, including Compooky's super-computer intelligence, Starlena's siren song, Odious' super-strength, and Abnermal's force fields and ice powers. Because of Garzooka's reluctance to injure his friends, the Mutanator was able to defeat him, but was later split apart and restored to the original members of Pet Force. The Lethal Lizards A trio of reptiles from the swamp planet of Reptilius, mutated by energy emitted from Vetvix's laboratory during her experiments with the Mutanator and K-Niner. They acquire superpowers and humanoid forms and, after learning of Vetvix's plans and Emperor Jon, decide to take over the universe themselves. The trio do not get along very well, often insulting each other with dry wit and sarcasm, and their arguments sometimes even escalate to physical violence. In the end, Pet Force defeats them, and they are carted off to prison. Their members consist of: * Dragon: A ten-foot-tall Komodo dragon, and the leader of the group, who also has a short temper and dislikes to give up any position of power among his gang or admit when he is wrong. He is noted by Garzooka as having superpowers similar to his own; he possesses superhuman strength, razor-sharp claws, and the ability to breathe fire. Due to his mutation, he is also intelligent enough to figure out how to capably fly a spaceship. * Chameleon: A five-foot-tall chameleon who possesses potentially unlimited shapeshifting powers in addition to a long tongue similar to Odious's. In addition, his eyes can rotate independently of one another, allowing him to look in two directions at once. * Snake: A fifteen-foot-long boa constrictor. Before his mutation, he was barely a foot long and had no fangs. He can squeeze his opponents with incredible force, open his mouth incredibly wide to swallow people whole, and his venom can kill a victim within a few minutes. Also, as he has no ears and is thus deaf, he is completely immune to the effects of Starlena's siren song.  References  1\\\\.

Scott received his A.B., A.M, and Ph.D from the University of Michigan. In the preface to The New Composition Rhetoric, Newton Scott states ‚Äúthat composition is‚Ä¶a social act, and the student [should] therefore constantly [be] led to think of himself as writing or speaking for a specified audience. Thus not mere expression but communication as well is made the business of composition.‚Äù Fred Newton Scott saw rhetoric as an intellectually challenging subject. He looked to English departments to balance work in rhetoric and linguistics in addition to literary study.  Questions facing 19th-century rhetoricians  Rhetoric in the 1890s was full of vigorous experimentation in rhetorical theory and practice. The Harvard Reports of 1892, 1895, and 1897 generated much public interest and concern about the teaching of writing.Murphy, James J. ed. A Short History of Writing Instruction; From Ancient Greece to Modern America. Lawernce Erlbaum Associates; New Jersey, 2001. At this time, composition was shifting away from an emphasis on oratory skills. The 19th-century American University was experiencing a major transformation in its educational purposes. Education was opening up to everyone, including women. Classical rhetoric was being displaced as schools responded to more practical needs, like preparing their students to be excellent employees. Originally, classical rhetoric studies were geared to composition that included emotional and ethical appeals in addition to logical ones. The purpose of oratory skills at this point was persuasion and included a concern of the emotional disposition of the audience. The classical composer shaped the work to be appealing. The composer was to discover the best possible reasons for their argument and persuade the audience to accept their point of view. This belief system began to change. Current-traditionalists were not concerned with probabilities and the subjects were essentially factual or able to be proven. The goal was not to persuade anyone to a particular conclusion. Rather, the focus was just to present the information to the audience and let them do with it what they will. This new method affected the tone and arrangement of the work. Instead of arranging the piece to convince the audience of something, they just arranged it to reflect a rational thought process that the audience could follow. The arrangement became deductive; it was just a way to report facts. Questions for 19th century rhetoricians:Gaillet, Lynee Lewis. \\"Learning from Our Predecessors: The Work of Fred Newton Scott and George Jardine.\\" Paper Presented at the Annual Meeting of the Conference on College Composition and Communication, March 1993. 1\\\\. How relevant is psychology to composition? 2\\\\. How can the change in practical teaching skills caused by a changing social climate best be dealt with? 3\\\\. Is teaching grammar really beneficial to the composing process? 4\\\\. What is the relationship between rhetoric and literary studies? 5\\\\. Should the focus of writing instruction be parts-to-whole or whole-to parts?  John Dewey‚Äôs influence  Fred Newton Scott promoted a drive for social efficiency by promoting a democratic rhetoric that responded to the progressive agenda of John Dewey. John Dewey was a highly influential figure in Scott‚Äôs life. Dewey believed in a progressive style of education that was a holistic experience.Mastrangelo, Lisa S. \\"Building a Dinosaur from the Bones: Fred Newton Scott and Women's Progressive Era Graduate Work at the University of Michigan.\\" Rhetoric Review, 24.4, 403-20. Lawerence Erlbaum Associates, Inc, 2005. Both men attended the same college and they spent much time discussing and debating the current theory of rhetoric. Scott based most of his work on social rhetoric on the progressive ideals John Dewey advocated. Their close ties are demonstrated by the flattering and highly complimentary biographical pieces each wrote on the other.  Classical Rhetoric  Fred Newton Scott encouraged a Platonic concept of writing. He stressed that writing is a social act that may be used as a method of seeking the truth. ‚ÄúAlthough he advocates the Aristotelian concept of adapting the message to the audience, he does not simply view meaning as external to the writing process; instead he believes that meaning is created through the interaction between interlocutor and the audience. Scott shares Plato‚Äôs concern for the welfare of the community and the belief that good discourse is that which by disseminating truth creates a healthy public opinion and thus effects, in Plato‚Äôs words, ‚Äòa training and improvement in the souls of the citizens.‚Äô‚Äù Scott also illustrated the importance of the audience within the system. ‚ÄúHe was also often described as a ‚ÄòSocratic‚Äô teacher, using a question-and- discovery method of teaching to inspire his students to learn material on their own rather than repeating information given by the teacher.‚Äù Scott did not follow the current traditional theory of rhetoric as it left out the importance of the audience. Instead, he advanced the view that by considering the audience, the author is reminded of the social nature of studying composition.  Social rhetoric  Progressivism, as applied to individuals, refers to a group of social reformers active around the beginning of the 20th century. Included in their ranks were educators, like John Dewey, social welfare workers, like Jane Addams, and journalists, like Lincoln Steffens. Their core belief is that the survival of the nation was dependent on the achievement of a virtuous democracy.Adler-Kassner, Linda. \\"Stories Told in School: What an Essay Is in Progressive and Contemporary Composition Texts.\\" Paper Presented at the Annual meeting of the Conference on College Composition and Communication, April 1998. Scott also felt it was important that Americans unite under a common ideology. > ‚ÄúThe most prominent characteristic of this ideology was engagement with a > set of political and civil ideals stemming from the legacy of republicanism: > commitment to the public good and the health of the nation; a belief in > liberty so that all could be free to participate in public affairs; the > creation of community, so that all would share an equal existence among > others sharing and participating in the same commitments.‚Äù Scott viewed the educational experience as self-development within a democratic environment, and was a method of training young minds to be active participants in a democratic society. In essence, Scott viewed writing as a social act performed through a complex interaction of writer, audience, subject, and language. Due to his concern for social reform and harmony, and for the preparation for economic integration, education should be utilized for the good of all; it should be utilized to prepare citizens for democracy. Writing should be taught within a complete rhetorical situation, a situation that was thoroughly social without denying the importance of the individual. Scott, in his work ‚ÄúA Substitute,‚Äù describes writing as: > ‚Äúessential for building character‚Ä¶moral courage, self-reliance, respect for > the truth in every aspect‚Ä¶sympathy for our fellow human beings, and an > active desire to help them and co-operate with them, a love of justice and > fair play, belief in democratic institutions, [and] loyalty to our > republic.‚Äù Scott saw an intrinsic connection between the essay and the survival of the nation, and he argued that mastering the conventions associated with this form would bring with it assimilation of the values that he believed would ensure that survival. In Two Ideals of Composition Instruction, Scott argued that mastering the right sort of English was crucial for the survival of the nation. > ‚ÄúLanguage [i]s the mode by which culture is imparted‚Ä¶and with mastery of the > mother tongue [came] the obligation to use this great instrument for the > training and instruction of the souls of the citizens.‚Äù Scott saw a number of factors threatening this. In his essay English Composition as a Mode of Behavior, Scott probed the causes of the errors occurring in the transmission of values reflected in the language that was necessary for the perpetuation of the culture. Scott determined that there were two main causes for the student errors that came out of the breakup of community during this period: the influence of spoken foreign languages and the breaking up of the family tradition. The three evidences he cites as the breakup of family tradition are: the Sunday newspaper, the telephone, and the automobile. In other words, Scott felt that media that was used for communication broke up the family unit. Scott also contrasted two different styles of speech and illustrated the distinctions between them. The first he called degraded speech and he compares it to a foreign language or media language. The second is acceptable speech, which represents the family language and is more acceptable in school because it has fewer errors than degraded speech. Scott recommended two solutions to encourage the nation to form common goals and bonds. The first is to give the people and education because with this information they will feel part owner in the system and actively participate. The second is that it will encourage individual achievement and satisfaction and they will continue to focus on their own development. Works *Scott, Fred Newton, and Gertrude Buck.

The word Erasermate in and of itself has become known as the erasable pen of the Papermate product line. Three EraserMate TW pens viewed in their original cases. From left to right, we have a blue ink TW200, a black ink TW400, and a black ink TW200. The original Erasermate pen was a refillable ballpoint pen fitted with a replaceable eraser. A disposable version called Erasermate 2 was subsequently introduced, with an appearance similar to the non-erasable Write Bros. stick pen, except for a slightly larger girth, and of course the black eraser, affixed to the pen's cap. The eraser, similar to that of a standard no. 2 pencil, was about 5 mm in diameter, and 10 mm in length. The eraser was held in place by the force exerted by the cylindrical abscess of the pen cap. The eraser could be removed, but replacing it required more effort. Erasermates come in blue, black and red ink, with the pen's exterior often matching the color of its ink. In 1979/80 Papermate introduced two retractable versions of the Erasermate; called the TW200 and TW400, they carried retail prices of $7.50 and $9.50 respectively. The TW name was possibly used to signify \\"twist\\", as both the ink cartridge and the eraser would retract by twisting the pen tip, which clicked into place when fully exposed. To close, the user would twist it the other direction hiding the ink and eraser inside the pen's body. The erasable ink took over a decade to develop and needs to be pressurized slightly for continuous flow during use. A positive consequence of this pressure is that writing is possible through a wider range of paper to pen angle than with non-erasable ballpoint pens.Papermate Pens through the decades.

Production The work, a departure from machine-made commercial cutlery and hollowware, was named Martel√©, from the French verb marteler, \\"to hammer\\". The line was made from 1896 through the 1930s by the Gorham Manufacturing Company of Providence, Rhode Island under the direction of Gorham's chief executive, Edward Holbrook, and his chief designer, William Christmas Codman who was brought over from England in 1891. According to Charles Carpenter (Gorham Silver) the metal used in Martel√© was softer and purer than the sterling standard (950/1000 parts of silver, where sterling is 925/1000) in order to make the silver more malleable and easier to work by hand. Pristo (Martel√©: Gorham's Nouveau Art Silver) indicates that Martel√© was initially produced in sterling, but that the higher standard was likely used to meet the French requirement of .950 for the Paris exhibition (silver imported to France would need to be the .950 fineness). The purity was raised again during 1905 to .9584, likely to match the Britannia standard so the silver would be of the highest grade and could not be considered \\"inferior,\\" especially in light of the awards won. For early items, each object began as a flat piece of silver, raised with hammering to the desired shape by the maker before being passed on to the chaser (the craftsman that added decoration). The finished pieces will show the hammer marks because they were not planished or buffed, another reason they were called Martel√©. Although uncommon, some of the later items, such as plates, may have started as spun but were then hammered (Pristo, page 42). A Martel√© dressing table took nine hundred hours to make and nearly fourteen hundred hours to chase, all in the context of a sixty-hour week. A coffeepot was raised in about seventy hours and chased in about seventy more, while a labor-intensive peppershaker could not be produced in less than about twenty-five hours, with another twenty hours for chasing. Only 4,800 pieces were produced (other accounts put the number at 7,000 to 8,000Gorham Corporation - an article on ASCAS: Association of Small Collectors of Antique Silver website) with Pristo indicating about 8200. Web sources indicate only 1500-1700 are still extant (Pristo indicating a suggestion not substantiated by auction records). When the price of silver went up in the 1980s, much Martel√© silver was melted down (also not substantiated - the quality of Martel√© was superior to items being melted, so few pieces were destroyed). Introduction Carpenter indicates that although it was introduced at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in 1897, Gorham waited to officially announce the introduction of this new line at the Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris, attended by 50,000,000 people. In fact, several hundred pieces were sold before the Paris exhibition, but Paris was the first major showing of Martel√© to an international audience. The Martel√© line was enthusiastically received by both critics and an enamored public at this world exposition. Gorham‚Äôs chief executive officer, Edward Holbrook, was made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur (the highest civilian honor given by the French government), and the chief designer for the Martel√© line, William Christmas Codman, was awarded a gold medal. Gorham went on to win five gold medals for its silver at the Exposition Universelle. Gorham continued to display Martel√© during the next expositions (Buffalo, St. Louis, Pan-Pacific, etc.) and continued to be awarded numerous prizes. Essentially, during the first 15 years of the 20th century, Martel√© was judged to be some of the best silver in the world. Design Martel√© items include tea and coffee services, vases, candelabra, tankards, platters, and love cups. They are often made in Art Nouveau style, with classic and fantastic figures of female figures, floral and leaf decorations. Each piece is different in that they were individually designed, and then hand made and chased which by nature produces uniqueness, where no two pieces can be the same Martel√© pieces were marked with the word \\"Martel√©\\", over an eagle that topped the usual Gorham Hallmark at the time (a lion, anchor, and initial G). Underneath it was marked 950-1000 FINE. In order to keep track of each piece, all of the items were uniquely identified by a numerical or letter code, with the code indicating whether the particular item was a sample or a special order. Price From the beginning, the Martel√© line was expensive and exclusive, and received many awards. Prices remain high for collectors today; current prices range from $6,500 to $180,000 for individual pieces to as much as $1 million or more for elaborate designs, including museum-quality pieces like the ewer made for the 1900 Paris Exposition.Magazine Antiques: Gorham Martele. . - Books About Antiques - book reviewhttp://www.upress.state.ms.us/catalog/spring2003/marvelous_martele.htmlAbout MarteleFrist Center for the Visual Arts - Nashville, TN Reed & Barton Reed & Barton's answer to Gorham's famous Martel√© silver line was to produce objects of a similar style and quality.

He was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1961. During his career, he won the Moscow Championship on six occasions (1955, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1972, and 1978) and scored numerous victories in international tournaments, such as Belgrade Open 1961, Moscow International 1961, East Berlin 1962, Reykjavik 1968, and Manila 1974. He was rarely at his best in Soviet Championship Finals, which were among the very toughest events in the world, and never made the Soviet team for an Olympiad or a European Team Championship. Vasiukov won the World Senior Chess Championship in 1995.  Early years  Vasiukov was born on March 5, 1933 in Moscow. His family was evacuated to Tula during World War II, and his father died in the Battle of Kursk. He learned to play chess at the age of 15, a very late age even for that time. In 1954, he was awarded the title Master of Sports of the USSR in Chess (ru). That same year, Vasiukokv represented Moscow in the Soviet Team Championship finals in Riga. He scored his first important chess success in 1955 by winning the Moscow City Championship with a score of 10¬Ω/15 points, ahead of Salo Flohr, who was second. He played in the Soviet Championship semi-final at Yerevan 1955 and finished in the middle of a powerful field. Vasiukov represented the Soviet Union twice in Student Olympiads. In 1955 at Lyon, he was first reserve, and scored 5¬Ω/6 (+5 =1 ‚àí0). Then at Uppsala 1956, he made exactly the same score as first reserve, this time winning a board gold medal. Both times, the Soviet Union won team gold medals. Although scoring respectably in his first two attempts at qualifying for the Soviet Final (10/18 at Kharkov 1956 and 10¬Ω/19 at Kiev 1957), he failed to advance, but was gathering experience and strength at high levels.  International Master  Vasiukov got his first international chance at Gotha 1957, where he placed third with 10/15; the winner was David Bronstein. This earned him the title of International Master in 1958; he won the Moscow Championship again later that same year. At the Moscow International of 1959 (Alexander Alekhine memorial), Vasiukov tied for 4th-6th places with 6/11, behind only winners Vasily Smyslov, Boris Spassky, and Bronstein. He made the field for his first Soviet final at Tbilisi 1959 (URS-26ch), where he finished tied 16th-17th with 7/19; Tigran Petrosian won. However, he regrouped with his third Moscow Championship title in 1960.  Grandmaster, peak form  Vasiukov (1973) Vasiukov scored his best result when he won the 1961 Belgrade Open, ahead of Svetozar Gligoriƒá. Then, in the Moscow International of 1961, he tied for first place with Smyslov at 7¬Ω/11. These two fine finishes earned him the title of Grandmaster later that year. In the 1961 Moscow Championship, he tied for 3rd‚Äì5th places with 11/17, behind winners Bronstein and Leonid Shamkovich. Qualifying again for the Soviet final at Baku 1961 (URS-29ch), he showed improvement to tie for 4th‚Äì5th places, with 12/20, as Spassky won. This would prove to be his best performance at that level. At the 1962 Moscow International, Vasiukov ended up second with 9¬Ω/15, behind winner Yuri Averbakh. Vasiukov proved his grandmastership at East Berlin 1962 with a powerful victory, at 11¬Ω/15, ahead of Leonid Stein. Vasiukov also tied for first in the 1962 Moscow Championship, his fourth title there. During his peak years, from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, Vasiukov scored wins in individual games over many top Soviet players, such as Smyslov, Bronstein, Tigran Petrosian, Mikhail Tal, Paul Keres, Mark Taimanov, Efim Geller, and Lev Polugaevsky. He was unable to defeat top-ranking Soviet stars such as Viktor Korchnoi, Anatoly Karpov, Boris Spassky, or Stein.  Soviet Championship frustrations  The Soviet Championships were usually the strongest tournaments in the world during Vasiukov's main competitive period, surpassing the strength of Interzonals, with very few if any weaker opponents, since the arduous qualifying process eliminated the outsiders. Other than his superb showing in 1961, Vasiukov usually played below his expectations in these finals. He qualified for the finals a total of eleven times. At Kiev 1964-5 (URS-ch32), he scored 8/19 to tie 13-14th place; the winner was Korchnoi. At Tallinn 1965 (URS-ch33), he again made only 8/19 for a tied 14-17th place; the winner was Stein. At Tbilisi 1966 (URS-ch34), also a Zonal, he scored below 50% once more with 9/20, for a tied 14-16th place, as Stein won again. The next year at Kharkov (URS-ch35), the format was a Swiss system, and Vasiukov was just above the middle of the pack, as Tal and Polugaevsky won. At Alma Ata 1968 (URS-ch36) he scored 10¬Ω/19, good for a tied 6-10th spot, as Polugaevsky tied with Alexander Zaitsev. At Moscow 1969 (URS-ch37), also a Zonal, he managed just 9¬Ω/22 for 15th place; the winners were Polugaevsky and Tigran Petrosian. At Baku 1972 (URS-ch40), he did well with 11¬Ω/21 for a tied 6-7th finish; the winner was Tal. At Leningrad 1974 (URS- ch42), he ended with 7/15 for a tied 12-13th place; the winners were Tal and Alexander Beliavsky. In the 1975 Vilnius Zonal, he scored 7¬Ω/15 for tenth place, as the winners were Boris Gulko, Vladimir Savon, Yuri Balashov, and Vitaly Tseshkovsky. Finally at Vilnius 1980-81 (URS-ch49), he placed tied 11-12th with 8¬Ω/17, as the winners were Beliavsky and Lev Psakhis. Since Vasiukov never placed near the top in Soviet Zonal competition, he was unable to earn an opportunity to play in an Interzonal tournament.  Tournament victories in five decades  Vasiukov was unable to maintain his peak of the early 1960s, but he remained remarkably competitive for many years afterwards, especially in international tournaments outside the Soviet Union which had mixed-strength fields, where he scored most of his successes. He won several titles, and was almost always around the top places, when he competed outside the Soviet Union. He tied for first at Polanica Zdroj 1965 with Peter Dely at 9¬Ω/13. At Reykjav√≠k 1968, he tied for first with Taimanov on 10¬Ω/14. He again tied with Taimanov for the title at Skopje 1970 with 11/15. Vasiukov claimed his fifth Moscow Championship in 1972. Vasiukov had the top performance of his career with his win at Manila 1974 at 10¬Ω/14, as he was ahead of Petrosian and Bent Larsen, among others, in a top-class field. He won at Zalaegerszeg 1977 with 9/12, ahead of Ratmir Kholmov. He was Moscow Champion for the sixth time in 1978, and won at Dnepropetrovsk 1980. He tied for first at Moscow 'B' 1986 (still a very strong field) on 7¬Ω/11, along with Edvins Kengis and Zurab Azmaiparashvili. Vasiukov won at Athens 1987 (Acropolis International) and at Budapest 1989 with 10/13, ahead of Gennady Timoshchenko. He took second at Belgorod 1990 (Miron Sher was first) at 9/14. He took the title at Graested 1990 with 6/9, ahead of Nigel Davies and Bent Larsen. He tied for first in a Veterans' event at Moscow 1991 with 5¬Ω/9, along with Geller.  International team play  While never making the Soviet side for an Olympiad or a European Team Championship, Vasiukov did get several chances to represent the Soviet Union in team matches. He played five times in the traditional match against Yugoslavia, at Lvov 1962, Rijeka 1963, Sukhumi 1966, Skopje 1969, and Tbilisi 1973. He played against Hungary at Moscow 1971. He also competed in the first two Telechess Olympiads: 'I' from 1977‚Äì78, and 'II' from 1981-82. In his latest years he was on the Russian team at the European and World Senior Team Championships.

Humans have split into two classes - the Chosen and the Quelled, of which Elsha is the latter. The Quelled are doomed to spend their lives in servitude to the Chosen, mining \\"firestones\\" - the only means of warmth on the planet. The Firelord is the leader of the Chosen, said to be a great and powerful man. A rebellious girl, Elsha causes trouble for herself - even going so far as being considered for execution - until she is met by a Chosen man named Amasai, Steward of the Firelord, and given the highest position available to a woman - Handmaiden to the Firelord. The Firelord's life is not known to the Chosen, but he actually made better lives for many Quelled when he was younger. He became Firelord when he was old so he could call upon a young Handmaiden to continue his previous work. On her journeys with the Firelord, Elsha meets Teraj, later revealed to be the Firelord's son, with whom Elsha forms a romantic relationship. Elsha uses her unlikely position to fight the stigma and oppression of her people, eventually inheriting the title for herself after the Firelord's unexpected death and changing the course of the planet's history for the better.

He was covered in tattoos, and he had three scripted L's tattooed on his wrist,\\" she recalled. \\"When I asked him what it meant, he said, 'Like, Love, Lust, baby'‚Äîand he pointed at his wife and said, 'That's all that matters. You got that, and you got everything'.\\"Hannah Levin, Seattle Weekly, February 7, 2007 Sykes said \\"Aftermath\\" drew its inspiration from Swedish singer-songwriter Nicolai Dunger, who provides backup vocals on another song, \\"Station Grey\\". \\"It was magical,\\" she said. \\"He was just sitting on my couch and playing a bunch of his songs, some of my favorites.

Sykes said: \\"Phil's playing kind of blows me away, and in my writing process, now, it turns out that the songs have a lot more space for him to do things, important things.

He is also the President of Fundaci√≥n Libertad y Desarrollo Early years and family Dionisio Gutierrez is the second son of Dionisio Gutierrez and Esperanza Mayorga. His grandfather, Juan Bautista Gutierrez, was a Spaniard businessman and entrepreneur who established in Guatemala in the first years of the 20th century. On October 3, 1974, Gutierrez's father died in a plane crash. According to Francisco Perez de Ant√≥n, that tragedy led to a ‚Äúgenerational void‚Äù inside the Gutierrez family, and Gutierrez began to work in Grupo Gutierrez in 1976, when he was only 17 years old. Business career By the end of the 1970s, Gutierrez and his cousin Juan Luis Bosch took on a shared Chief Executive Officer role at Corporaci√≥n Multi Inversiones, a family owned multinational corporation. Gutierrez held the presidency role in the company until In 2010, when he gave way his position in the company to his brother Juan Jos√©, to focus on the academia and political analysis think tank over which he presides. Civic career Gutierrez was in projects of several student associations and groups during his college years, where he denounced both the actions of the military government and the Marxist guerrilla, including Electorama 82, an effort by young people to audit the electoral process of March 7, 1982. Gutierrez also participated with the ‚ÄúStudent Committee Against Terrorism‚Äù and the ‚ÄúCivil Student Front‚Äù, with several publications in the independent journal El Imparcial For seven years, Gutierrez was president of the Free Enterprise Chamber and led one of the first programs of political surveys in the country. The first publication ‚ÄúGuatemala Responde 1987‚Äù (Guatemala Answers 1987) revealed Guatemalan citizen‚Äôs opinion about the economic, political and social situation in the first years of Vinicio Cerezo. In 1989, he published a second edition ‚ÄúGuatemala Responde IV: Percepciones y opiniones del pueblo guatemalteco despu√©s de 37 meses de gobierno democr√°tico‚Äù and in 1990, he issued a political survey about the voter‚Äôs preferences on the presidential elections of that year. Gutierrez hosted a TV show broadcast in Guatemala, other cities in Central America and the United States called Libre Encuentre, which encouraged thought and debate among leaders from different sectors of the society. Gutierrez stirred debate and controversy among guests from all social sectors and experts, in many occasions abandoning his role as moderator, and participating in the arguments. In May 1993, Jorge Antonio Serrano El√≠as, tried to dissolve the Congress, dismiss the Supreme Court of Justice, the Constitutional Court and the Human Rights Delegate. Guti√©rrez was among a group of citizens who issued a declaration \\"Given the political crisis the country is undergoing\\", better known as the document of \\"Los Abajo Firmantes\\", where they rejected the actions of El√≠as, calling him \\"dictator\\" and demanding his resignation as well as the restitution of the Public Powers of the republic. They organized citizen protests, marches and rallies in front of the National Palace, through a platform called the National Consensus Instance. In early 2003, president Alfonso Portillo attacked the media calling them ‚Äúclowns‚Äù, saying they were ‚Äúat the service of obscure interests‚Äù and referring to Gutierrez as ‚Äúthe circus owner‚Äù. Gutierrez issued a response stating that ‚Äúthe government called conspirator and subversive to any person who speaks the truth about the President‚Äù. On July 24, 2003, former President Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt demanded that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal register him as a presidential candidate, despite being banned for having led a coup d'√©tat. Several people took different points of the city, and one of the most threatened places was the Centro Empresarial building, where the corporate offices of Multi Inversiones is located. One of the most fierce opponents of the inscription of R√≠os Montt was Gutierrez. According to Prensa Libre: \\"That day, the lives of hundreds of employees in that building was put at risk, because several tires were set on fire, which made the air unbreathable, and the mob threatened to burn the building.\\" After being besieged for twelve hours, 900 people who had been trapped in the Centro Empresarial building were rescued and the protesters withdrew. On Thursday, July 1, 2010, the government of President √Ålvaro Colom denounced a \\"destabilization plan composed of attacks on security forces and reports in some media outlets\\" and accused Guti√©rrez as one of those responsible for that plan. In response, the businessman said \\"With all due respect, I ask you not to fall into the totalitarian trap\\". Months later, Guti√©rrez started one of the most controversial episodes of 2010 due to a comment against President Colom and his wife at the National Entrepreneurs Conference.El Peri√≥dico. Guatemala, viernes 24 de diciembre de 2010. P√°gina 4. After the incident, Gutierrez distanced himself from the ‚ÄúLibre Encuentro\\" program and the country, alleging, among other reasons, the \\"evident increase in forms of harassment and intimidation, even constant death threats\\" against him. On September 19, 2018, after three years away from television, Gutierrez made a comeback to the screen with the show ‚ÄúRaz√≥n de Estado‚Äù, broadcast through Guatevisi√≥n channel. According to the show's website, ‚Äúit is a tribune for debate and reflection, engaged with freedom, democracy, and rule of law‚Äù. Fundaci√≥n Libertad y Desarrollo In 2012, Guti√©rrez created the Fundaci√≥n Libertad y Desarrollo (Freedom and Development Foundation), an independent, private think tank dedicated to the study and analysis of social, economic and political issues to promote values and principles of a free society. As president of the Foundation, Guti√©rrez leads a team of intellectuals with whom he works in multiple civic activities and develops the articulation of long-term state proposals for Central America. On January 27, 2013, the Foundation sponsored the television show \\"Dimension\\", which was broadcast weekly on Canal 3, under the direction of Guti√©rrez until August 2018. The show dealt with social issues and tried to promote participation \\"to generate reflection on the complex problems that afflict Guatemalan and Central American societies‚Äù. In August 2015, following the announcement of the participation of Vice President Roxana Baldetti and President Otto P√©rez Molina in a structure dedicated to customs fraud in Guatemala known as La L√≠nea, Guti√©rrez called for the resignation of Molina in a public letter from the Libertad y Desarrollo Foundation. In an interview in a local media outlet, Guti√©rrez said about Molina \\"An individual I met in the Serranazo days, and with whom I no longer had a significant contact until the end of 2010, when he was the most persecuted opposition politician, and I was the most persecuted civil citizen by the government of the UNE party. And four months after he was appointed President, I denounced his would be another government taking Guatemala towards lost paths.\\" In September 2016, through the Fundaci√≥n Libertad y Desarrollo, Gutierrez opened the first Citizen Convention with a speech focused on inequality in the country. On March 7, 2018, the third Citizen Convention focused on the importance of the fight against corruption in Guatemala. Attorney General Thelma Aldana and Chief of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), Iv√°n Vel√°squez were invited as panelists, the latter participated through a pre-recorded interview. In his keynote, Gutierrez said that president Jimmy Morales had not been invited and encouraged him to \\"stop shaming Guatemala\\" and to \\"stop representing the obscure forces that don‚Äôt want the country to change. Your actions contradict your words.\\" On Wednesday March 6, 2019, the fourth Citizen Convention treated the electoral year under the title \\"Free elections or sequestered democracy?\\". More than 2,000 Guatemalans participated in the event, who came to listen to the conference by Guti√©rrez; the panel of former presidents Luis Alberto Lacalle (Uruguay), Andr√©s Pastrana (Colombia), Jorge Tuto Quiroga (Bolivia) and Felipe Calder√≥n (Mexico); the presentation of the First Electoral Survey 2019; and a panel of national analysts on the outlook for the 2019 elections. In late February 2018, Gutierrez made a public appearance, in the days of the formation of the Frente Ciudadano Contra la Corrupci√≥n (Citizen Front Against Corruption). The role of Gutierrez at the front of the fight against corruption has earned him criticism from different sectors. On April 30, 2018, Gutierrez sent a letter to twelve Senators and Congressmen of the United States, about the importance of the permanence of CICIG in Guatemala. In that letter, Gutierrez lists a number of prosecuted officials by the Guatemalan justice due to corruption. He also stated that CICIG ‚Äúhas demonstrated its ability to bring justice to Guatemala, and for the first time in recent history, let Guatemalans have trust and faith in their government institutions. On Wednesday March 4, 2020, Guti√©rrez and Fundaci√≥n Libertad y Desarrollo hosted the Fifth Citizen Convention, called \\"Central America, shared threats and opportunities; a common destiny‚Äù, which addressed the shared challenges of the Central American region and was attended by more than 30 global leaders.ref> Guti√©rrez presented the ‚ÄúJoint Declaration on the Central American Economic Community‚Äù, a document that was born out of the citizenry and seeks the presidents of the region and all the sectors involved in decision-making to join this commitment.. Awards and honors In 2012, the Power Awards and the American Business Council Foundation of the United States recognized the efforts and trajectory of Guti√©rrez by giving him the award ‚ÄúEmpowering Democracy\\". In 2014, King Felipe VI of Spain, awarded the Order of Civil Merit in Commendation to Guti√©rrez. He is also a founder and trustee of the School of Government in Guatemala. In September 2019, he was selected by Summa Magazine as the business leader with the best reputation in Central America. In July 2020, he was featured in Forbes Central America] magazine where, he reaffirmed the need for Central American integration as the only formula for the development of the region and to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.

In 1960, archaeologist Yigael Yadin discovered a leather pouch containing her personal documents in what came to be known as the Cave of Letters, near the Dead Sea. The documents found include such legal contracts concerning marriage (ketubba), property transfers, and guardianship. These documents, ranging from CE 96 to 134, depict a vivid picture of life for an upper-middle class Jewish woman during that time. They also provide an example of the Roman bureaucracy and legal system under which she lived. Life Registration document for four date orchards owned by Babatha Babatha was born in approximately 104 CE in Ma·∏•oza. Most likely the only child or the eldest daughter, she inherited her father's date palm orchard upon her parents‚Äô deaths. By 124 CE, she had been married and widowed with a young son, Jesus. She was remarried by 125 CE to Judah, owner of three date palm orchards in Ein Gedi, who had another wife and teenage daughter.Goodman It is uncertain whether Babatha lived in the same home as the first wife or if Judah traveled between two separate households, as polygamy was common and mandated by Law in the Jewish community.Freund, 199-207. Analysis The documents concerning this marriage offer insight to her status in the relationship. In their marriage contract, Judah's debts become part of her liability, indicating a financial equality. In 128 CE, a legal document shows that Judah took a loan without interest from Babatha, showing that she had control of her own money despite the union. Upon Judah's death in 130 CE, she seized his estates in Ein Gedi as a guarantee against his debts which she had covered as stated in the marriage contract.Freund, 200. Another document of importance concerns the guardianship of Babatha's son. In 125 CE, Babatha brought a suit to court against the appointed guardians of her orphaned son, citing their insufficient disbursement of funds. The document contains Babatha's petition that full guardianship responsibility of her son and his property be transferred to her control.Chiusi, 121. Death The latest documents discovered in the pouch concern a summons to appear in an Ein Gedi court as Judah's first wife, Miriam, had brought a dispute against Babatha regarding their late husband's property. Therefore, it is assumed that Babatha was near Ein Gedi in 132 CE, placing her in the midst of Bar Kokhba's revolt. It is likely that Babatha fled with Miriam and her family from the imminent violence of the revolt. Because the documents were never retrieved and because twenty skeletal remains were found nearby, historians have suggested that Babatha perished while taking refuge in the cave.Freund, 201.

Founded in 1909, they integrated the campaigns for improved status and welfare of women and children nationally and with overseas organisations.  History  The recently federated state of Western Australia was the second Australian state to grant most women a vote in government elections. Many existing and incipient organisations moved to capitalise on the emancipation of women and Women's Service Guilds (WSG) sought to co-ordinate the political actions of these organisations. Despite a 'conservative' membership, similar to the Country Women's Association (CWA) or later National Council of Women, the body sought to promote feminism and remain free of the two party system that dominated the political scene. The longtime president and cofounder of the WSG was Bessie Rischbieth who connected the organisation to British and American movements and led the organisation to become a national one. Other notable members include Roberta Jull and Edith Cowan (cofounders), Ruby Hutchison, Florence Cardell-Oliver, Mary M Bennett, Jean Beadle and broadcaster Irene Greenwood. The official organ of the WSG was the magazine, Dawn, through which Rischbieth (editor) and the guilds promoted causes such as representation of women in the judiciary, parliament and in the welfare system. The last issue of the Dawn newsletter was to contain the obituary of its long term editor. The organisations scope also included the prostitutes and prisoners of the nation. Their long running campaign to allow the admission of single women to a new hospital (KEMH) was met with staunch opposition from the establishment and media of the day. The Kindergarten system in the state was founded by the organisation, as was the local Girl Guides Association and a home for elderly women, the Mount Henry Hospital. The Civil Rehabilitation Council of Western Australia, the Prisoners Aid Society, the Society for the Preservation of Nature were also auspiced by the WSG. They were not limited to the newly entitled voters and advocated on behalf of the rights of children and women of the indigenous population of the nation. This was, along with activism for the conservation of Natural heritage, well in advance of international organisations of the 1960s or Australian social movements of the 1980s and 90s. Their agenda also included pacifist activism, such as the opposition to conscription, and other 'radical' causes. Some of these led to potential splits within the guilds, Cowan actively supported conscription for example, but Rischbieth is credited with maintaining the unity of the movement. She also coordinated with the League of Nations to form a national organisation that addressed issues on a national level. The WSG were affiliated with the Karrakatta Club, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Western Australia and international suffrage movements.  Legacy  The Kings Park memorial to pioneering women was founded. The WSG ceased its operation in 1997, nearly 90 years after it began. On the day of disbandment, Cheryl Davenport addressed the state parliament with the details of the achievements of WSG.

Named after counties in Kansas and Nebraska, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-532 was laid down on 24 September 1943 at Evansville, Indiana, by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Company; launched on 28 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Fred M. Wyatt; and commissioned on 20 January 1944 with Lieutenant Marinus Pilkington in command. Service history During World War II, LST-532 was assigned to the European Theater and participated in the Invasion of Normandy in June, 1944. She loaded troops and equipment including vehicles at Trebah Beach (called Polgwidden in US sources), Helford River, near Falmouth, Cornwall, on 1 June 1944. This location was the most westerly embarkation site for this operation and the distance that they had to travel to rendezvous with the rest of the Operation Neptune fleet meant that these personnel then spent the next 5 days aboard this flat bottomed vessel in the terrible weather conditions that delayed the Overlord landings until 6 June. Footage taken by a US Army Film Unit on 1 June 1944 shows her together with LSTs 533 and 27 loading at Trebah. Following the War, she operated with the Service Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. The ship was decommissioned on 8 June 1955 and renamed USS Chase County (LST-532) on 1 July 1955. On 15 April 1967 she was transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) and served as USNS Chase County (T-LST-532) until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 June 1973. Transferred to the Republic of Singapore in 1973, she was later sold into commercial service as MS Constructors. Her final fate is unknown. LST-532 earned one battle star for World War II service.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 2002. The settlement was established by abolitionists in late 1856, with construction starting in 1857. The town was rapidly settled by migrants aided by the New England Emigrant Aid Company, who were trying to help secure Kansas as a free territory.\\"Bleeding Kansas, 1853-1861\\", Judgment Day, PBS Online-WGBH, accessed 18 Dec 2008 One of a number of villages hugging the narrow bank of the Missouri River under the bluffs, the town was a free state port-of-entry for abolitionist forces of Kansas. It was established as part of the resistance to stop the westward spread of slavery. Quindaro's people also aided escaped slaves from Missouri and linked them to the Underground Railroad. After Kansas was established as a free state, there was less unique need for the port and the growth slowed in the commercial district. At the same time the economy in Kansas suffered from over-speculation. In 1862 classes were started for children of former slaves, and in 1865 a group of men chartered Quindaro Freedman's School (later Western University), the first black school west of the Mississippi River. Former slaves continued to gather in the residential community, which became mostly African American by the late 19th century. The area was incorporated into Kansas City in the early 20th century. Gradually the lower commercial townsite was abandoned and became overgrown. The townsite was rediscovered during archaeological study in the late 1980s, which revealed many aspects of the 1850s town.Michael M. Swann, \\"The Educational Value of Quindaro Townsite in the 21st Century\\" , National Park Service, 1998, accessed 17 Dec 2008 History Quindaro was founded in the 1850s by abolitionists, settlers sent by the New England Emigrant Aid Society, Wyandots, and freedmen. The Society had aided more than 1,200 settlers in their migration, hoping to secure Kansas as a free territory. The decision was to be left to the vote of the territory's residents. Quindaro was one of several competing small ports on the Missouri River. Planners seeking to establish a Free-State port noted the site's advantages: > At a point six miles above the mouth of the Kansas river, on Wyandotte > Indian land, they found a fine natural rock ledge where the river ran along > the bank six to twelve feet deep, making a convenient landing.

After the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act was passed in 1854, a western branch of the Underground Railroad was developed in Kansas. Quindaro was linked to this and the Lane Trail. It provided a new route of escape for slaves from Missouri. It was most important in the years before Kansas was established as a free state in 1861. Quindaro became a legendary port for fugitive slaves and, later, blacks arriving as contraband (escapees) during the American Civil War. Clarina Nicholshttp://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/clarina-nichols/12156\\\\ was a writer for the Quindaro Chindowan, a friend of Susan B. Anthony and fellow crusader for the rights of women and children.http://quindaro.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-chapter-frontier- justice.html She was an important Conductor and Station Master of the Underground Railroad in Quindaro. She left a letter telling about a time when a Freedom Seeker named Caroline was brought to her house.http://lifedocumentaries.com/escape-tunnel.html Caroline's slave master and other slave hunters were camped on the edge of town and looking for her. Clarina tells of hiding Caroline in an empty cistern overnight and then sending her on the road North as soon as it was safe.http://lifedocumentaries.com/clarina-nichols.html Due to economic pressures that afflicted much of Kansas, the commercial townsite declined. Later-arriving African-American residents settled in the upper town on the bluff. The economy declined because of over-speculation in Kansas, and in 1862 the legislature withdrew the town charter, putting the town company out of business. Difficulties in reaching the interior from below the bluff hampered commerce, and changes after the war reduced the need for the port. In addition, the topography was difficult, surrounding Wyandot land limited expansion, and problems with land titles inhibited growth. After being abandoned, the early lower commercial townsite became overgrown, with some areas covered by earth falling from the bluffs. In the early 20th century, all of the townsite was incorporated into Kansas City Even before the war ended, however, Eben Blachly, a Presbyterian, in 1862 started classes in his home for the children of former slaves. The Reverend Eben Blachly had been a farmer in Dane County, Wisconsin, one of the early pioneers who had migrated from Pennsylvania. According to Blachly family legend, he was nearly hung as a \\"northern spy\\" while trying to find his oldest son, a Union soldier who had been captured by the Confederates. With the noose around his neck he asked to say some final words, a wish that was granted by the rebels. After praying out loud for the welfare of their souls (the rebels were about to hang an innocent man), they took the noose off his neck and sent him home to Wisconsin. This traumatic experience, apparently, led him to dedicate his life to helping former slaves by organizing the Quindaro Freedman's School (later Western University), which was chartered in 1867, and which he ran until his death in 1877. It was a historically black university (HBUC) started at the upper town site of Quindaro. Its principal in 1872, when the state legislature added a four-year normal school, was Charles Henry Langston, a leading black abolitionist and activist, educator, and politician in Ohio and Kansas. In the early 20th century, Western University became known for its outstanding music program. Music historian Helen Walker-Hill, writing in the Black Music Journal, states that \\"Western University at Quindaro, Kansas, was probably the earliest black school west of the Mississippi and the best black musical training center in the Midwest for almost thirty years during the 1900s through the 1920s.\\" In the early 1900s, Western University also added a full industrial curriculum, with buildings to house livestock and another for a laundry. Later a building was added for teaching auto mechanics and repair. The university closed in 1943, and nothing but cornerstones of some early buildings still exist. Some buildings were lost to fire, others to demolition as sites were redeveloped. The last structures remaining were three faculty houses, which were demolished near the end of the 20th century. \\"Virtual Tour: Western University\\", Quindaro, Kansas on the Underground Railroad, Online exhibit, Kansas City, Kansas Library, 2000, accessed 20 Dec 2008 Rediscovery An archaeological study in 1987‚Äì1988, required for a public project, revealed the remains of the 1850s townsite. The foundations of 20 main buildings, two outbuildings, three wells, and one cistern were found. From original maps, newspapers, and letters, researchers know other structures existed. Because of the significance of the town, the townsite has been designated an archaeological district on the National Register of Historic Places. A number of public history projects have been undertaken to engage the public and share the discoveries.\\"Quindaro, Kansas on the Underground Railroad\\", Online exhibit, Kansas Collection at the Kansas City, Kansas Library, 2000, accessed 20 Dec 2008 In 1993, Kansas State University, in cooperation with the Mayor's Underground Railroad Advisory Commission and the Quindaro Town Preservation Society, commissioned graduate students to develop proposals for a park to incorporate the ruins and archaeology of Quindaro. Their 13 proposals were presented at a major public meeting, displayed at the state capitol's rotunda, and presented in numerous venues around the state. While consensus is lacking on how to develop a park, the plans have been successful in engaging the public and teaching history. In 1996, the University of Kansas sponsored a major oral history project, in which more than a dozen professors interviewed people among the nearby African-American community for their family accounts of Quindaro. The history and legends of the settlement lived in stories told by their descendants and friends. Because of the brief life of Quindaro, it was not much documented in written records. Public history projects have identified some new sources. In December 2007, the Kansas Humanities Council awarded a grant to the Concerned Citizens of Old Quindaro, Kansas City, for In Unity There is Strength: The African American Experience, an exhibit to interpret the history of former slaves who escaped to Quindaro from across the Missouri River in the mid-19th century.

It was first published in 1979 by Grove Press, simultaneously in hardcover and softcover. The book is a metafictional and parodistic examination of the creative process of writing a novel and its failing. It is dedicated to Brian O'Nolan and his \\"virtue hilaritas\\". The title is a direct reference to the hodge-podge nature of the food. More cryptically, it is a punning allusion (\\"Mulligan's too\\") to the character Buck Mulligan in James Joyce Ulysses. Prepublication Sorrentino began the novel in November 1971 and finished it in February 1975. At the time it was titled Synthetic Ink. His agent shopped it out, unsuccessfully. The novel received nearly thirty rejections. Most publishers praised the novel, often extravagantly, but because of its great length and avant-garde nature it would be too expensive a loss. Eventually, in 1978, Grove Press accepted the book, subject to three demands. Barney Rosset wanted a different title, and got it. Rosset wanted the rejection letters to be published as part of the book, and Sorrentino agreed, although he supplied parody versions. Rosset wanted the Masque of Fungo section deleted, Sorrentino refused, and Rosset conceded. Release details Several excerpts and chapters had been published independently in literary magazines since 1973.

Translated by Bernard H≈ìpffner with Catherine Goffaux as Salmigondis. Plot summary The book is a multi-layered novel-in novel. Starting even before the front matter a letter exchange between editors and Sorrentino is presented expressing their reasons for rejecting the novel. The novel itself consists of three main layers, namely the comments, notes and letters of the fictitious author, Antony Lamont, as he develops and writes his novel initially called ‚ÄúGuinea Red‚Äù and later titled ‚ÄúCrocodile Tears‚Äù, various chapters of Lamont‚Äôs novel with Martin Halpin as the protagonist all stylistically different, and the comments of Halpin himself who is the main ‚Äúactor‚Äù of Lamont‚Äôs novel. Other matter is interspersed such as advertisement, erotic poems for Lamont to review, a masque play, and an academic-type manuscript concerning a mathematical proof. As part of the \\"stew\\" the novel contains intentionally \\"bad writing\\". In Lamont‚Äôs novel Halpin believes that he has killed his friend and business partner Ned Beaumont. Beaumont had a love affair with Daisy Buchanan who is married to Tom Buchanan and also became a love interest of Halpin. Beaumont, however, had fallen under the seductive spell of two other women who went on exploiting him, and Halpin‚Äôs efforts to ‚Äúrescue‚Äù had been futile. As Lamont develops his novel he seeks unsuccessfully the support of his ex-wife Joanne and his sister, Sheila Lamont, who is married to Dermot Trellis, writer of ‚ÄúThe Red Swan‚Äù. Lamont despises the more successful brother-in-law in part because he believes he writes with a commercial interest in mind. He is furious when the Midwestern Associate Professor Roche prefers his work over Lamont‚Äôs for his course. He tries unsuccessfully to seduce a poet who has sent him erotic material. Under the impression that there is a conspiracy against him he schemes on how to publish his novel. Halpin and Beaumont have a life of their own, outside of Lamont‚Äôs novel and unbeknownst to him. They complain about their work, the shabby dialogue, the degradations and the incomplete scenery, and meet other characters who also complain about their writers, notably the clich√©s they are exposed to. As Lamont is developing his novel, he becomes more and more pretentious and delusional, his support systems fail, and the ‚Äústory‚Äù gets out of hand. As he loses direction and control, Halpin fears he even may have died. Eventually his characters leave him and Halpin runs off, - Beaumont, too, provided he is \\"alive\\". Intertextual allusions The concept that characters have a life of their own is seen in the work of Brian O‚ÄôNolan to whom the book is dedicated. Thus characters of Mulligan Stew have links to other works, among them: * Antony Lamont, Sheila Lamont, Dermot Trellis in At Swim-Two-Birds by Brian O‚ÄôNolan * Daisy and Tom Buchanan in The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald * Martin Halpin in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake * Ned Beaumont in The Glass Key by Dashiell Hammett Reviews Mulligan Stew was widely reviewed on first publication. McPherson quotes excerpts from 72 reviews. According to the New York Times Mulligan Stew was Sorrentino's commercially most successful novel and named one of the best books of 1979 by the New York Times Book Review.

Lefebvre and Havy's business grew steadily, as they personally handled cargos and eventually came to own a small ship of their own, the Parfaite Union. They experienced a setback when they invested in a sealing station in Labrador with Louis Bazil and Louis Fornel, and retained their interest in it until the 1745 capture of Louisbourg by Anglo-Americans cut them off from it.

It was serialized in Shogakukan's Betsucomi magazine from the May 2003 issue (released in April) to the July 2006 issue (released in June). Shogakukan collected the individual chapters into 10 bound volumes from August 2003 to August 2006. The series won the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award in the sh≈çjo manga category in 2005. Viz Media licensed the manga for an English-language release in North America, first serialized in their Shojo Beat magazine in 2007 and later published in ten print volumes from January 2008 to January 2011. The manga is also licensed by Kana in France and by Planet Manga in Germany. In 2007, Sand Chronicles inspired a live-action Japanese television drama series which aired during the half-hour Love Theatre time-slot on TBS. In 2008, the manga was adapted into a live-action Japanese feature film directed by Shinsuke Sato, starring Kaho and Nao Matsushita as the main character Ann during different stages of her life. Plot Twelve-year-old Ann Uekusa and her mother move to the small town of Shimane, where Ann's grandparents live and everyone seems to be familiar with everyone else. Ann soon becomes friends with Daigo, a young boy who lives in Shimane, as well as Fuji and Shika, Fuji's younger sister and her best friend in Shimane. When Ann's mother, Miwako, commits suicide, Daigo helps Ann cope with the sudden change in her life. They fall in love, but Ann's life can only become more complicated when her estranged father suddenly arrives from Tokyo. After greatly contemplating going to Tokyo to live with her father after he asks her, she decides to stay. Ann tells Daigo about her decision but makes her go anyway. Ann and Fuji both live in Tokyo but hardly ever talk because Fuji goes to an elite high school, K High. Ann reunites with the friends she had before moving to Shimane and they continue their friendships. In Tokyo, she ends up becoming closer to Fuji, which causes conflict between her and Daigo. In Shimane, Shika learns the truth about her parentage; in her confusion, she begins to fall in love with Daigo. When Ann returns to Shimane, Shika upsets Ann's fragile emotional state so that Ann and Daigo will break up. In the end, Ann breaks up with Daigo for fear that her own sadness will weigh him down. Ann returns to Tokyo and starts a relationship with Fuji; however, because she does not love him, the relationship does not last. Daigo refuses Shika and rumors begin to circulate that he is interested in his middle school classmate Ayumu, who has been helping him studying to get into university and become a teacher. Nearing graduation, Ann learns that her father and his friend Kaede Kuroki have been dating and she is pregnant with Ann's half-sister. After attending her middle school reunion, Ann spends some time with Daigo, where he tells her to find her own happiness. Six years later, Ann meets a young businessman named Keiichiro Sakura and they become engaged shortly after. After Ann learns that he only uses people for his own gain, she confronts him about his insensitivity, but he is disappointed in her and breaks off the engagement. Almost a week afterward, she takes a train to Okayama, where Daigo teaches elementary school. Ann's grandmother, meanwhile, believes Ann will suffer the same fate as her mother. After a suicide attempt on the beach, Ann is taken to the hospital and later meets Daigo, who asks her to marry him. She says yes, and at the very end, the two are shown to be happily married with an infant son named Ryo. Meanwhile, Fuji decides to marry his cousin Mariko (against his family's wishes) and Shiika decides to work for her uncle in America.

Fuji tends to keep to himself and eventually decides to attend high school in Tokyo shortly before Ann leaves Shimane. He has doubts concerning who he is because it is suspected that Fuji is not his father's biological son (though his father has accepted him as such), but the son of one of his mother's affairs. It is revealed eventually that he did not result from the affair, though it remains the reason why his mother does not treat him the same as his younger sister. ; : Drama actresses: Akiko Kinouchi, (middle school), and (young girl) : Ann's best friend in Shimane and perhaps her only best friend growing up.

Hall A 16th-century image of a salamander from the Book of Lambspring The salamander is an amphibian of the order Urodela which, as with many real creatures, often has been ascribed fantastic and sometimes occult qualities by pre-modern authors (as in the allegorical descriptions of animals in medieval bestiaries) not possessed by the real organism. The legendary salamander is often depicted as a typical salamander in shape with a lizard-like form, but is usually ascribed an affinity with fire, sometimes specifically elemental fire. Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance lore This legendary creature embodies the fantastic qualities that ancient and medieval commentators ascribed to the natural salamander. Many of these qualities are rooted in verifiable traits of the natural creature but often exaggerated. A large body of legend, mythology, and symbolism has developed around this creature over the centuries. =Classical lore: Pliny, the Talmud, and Augustine= In one of the earliest surviving descriptions of a salamander, Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 CE) noted that the creature is \\"an animal like a lizard in shape and with a body specked all over; it never comes out except during heavy showers and goes away the moment the weather becomes clear.\\"\\"sicut salamandrae, animal lacertae figura, stellatum, numquam nisi magnis imbribus proveniens et serenitate desinens\\"Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, John Bostock and Henry Thomas Riley, eds., London: Taylor and Francis, 1855. Translation slightly modified. All of these traits, even down to the star-like markings, are consistent with the golden Alpine salamander (Salamandra atra aurorae) of Europe that has golden or yellow spots or blotches on its back* and some similarly marked subspecies of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra).* Pliny even made the important distinction between salamanders and lizards, which are similar in shape but different in other respects, which was not systematized until modern times, when biologists classified lizards as reptiles and salamanders as amphibians. Pliny recounts several other traits which are less credible, such as the ability to extinguish fire with the frigidity of their bodies, a quality which was reported as hearsay by Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BCE).History of Animals, Book V, Ch. XVII, Sec. 13 in the Cresswell translation While Pliny notes this in Book 10, Chapter 86 of the Natural History, in Book 29, Chapter 23 of the same work he views this idea with skepticism, pointing out that if such an idea were true, it should be easy to demonstrate. Pliny also notes medicinal and poisonous properties, which are founded in fact on some level, since many species of salamander, including fire salamanders and Alpine salamanders, excrete toxic, physiologically active substances. These substances are often excreted when the animal is threatened, which has the effect of deterring predators. The extent of these properties is greatly exaggerated though, with a single salamander being regarded as so toxic that by twining around a tree it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well could slay all who drank from it. The salamander is also mentioned in the Talmud (Hagiga 27a) as a creature that is a product of fire and it relates that anyone who is smeared with its blood will be immune to harm from fire. Rashi (1040‚Äì1105), the primary commentator on the Talmud, describes the salamander as one which is produced by burning a fire in the same place for seven years.\\"Salamandra and the Flames of Hell\\" by Reb Chaim HaQoton Saint Augustine in the City of God used the example of salamanders to argue for the possibility of humans being punished by being burned in eternal flame in Purgatory. He wrote \\"If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that everything which burns is not consumed.\\" =Medieval lore= A frequently-citedThis was also claimed in an early version of the present article. illustration of a salamander is presented in an influentialSahagun, Louis. Master of the Mysteries: The Life of Manly Palmer Hall. Port Townsend, Washington: Process Media, 2008, page 52. 20th-century occult work by Manly P. Hall, Secret Teachings of All Ages, in which it is attributed to Paracelsus.Manly P. Hall, The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy, (original publisher unclear-see for on-line text), (1928). This illustration appears to originate in a 1527 anti-papal tract by Andreas Osiander and Hans Sachs, where it is identified as \\"the Pope as a monster\\".Renate Freitag-Stadler and Erhard Sch√∂n, Die Welt des Hans Sachs, City History Museum of Nuremberg, 1976, p. 24 (Kat. 25/15) Its association with Paracelsus derives from his Auslegung der Magischen Figuren im Carth√§user Kloster zu N≈©rnberg in which the author presents explanations of some illustrations found in a Carthusian monastery in Nuremberg; the illustration in question he labels as \\"a salamander or desolate worm with a human head and crowned with a crown and a pope hat thereon,\\"\\"ein Salamander oder ein w√ºster Wurm/Mit einem Menschen Kopff/unnd gekr√∂net mit einer Kron/unnd ein Bapst Hut darinn\\" which is later explained to represent the Pope. Catholic Archbishop Raymund Netzhammer (1862‚Äì1945) explained that the set of woodcuts it belongs to was commissioned by Osiander based on some old \\"pope illustrations\\" found at the monastery, which Netzhammer thought may have dated back to the time of Joachim of Fiore (d. 1202) and were intended as cartoons mocking the Pope and the Church. Descriptions of the legendary form are more likely to use stylized depictions. In Medieval European bestiaries, fanciful depictions of salamanders include \\"a satyr-like creature in a circular wooden tub\\" (8th century), \\"a worm penetrating flames\\" (12th century), \\"a winged dog\\" (13th century), and \\"a small bird in flames\\" (13th century).Florence McCulloch, Medieval Latin and French Bestiaries Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962, pp.161‚Äì162 =Renaissance lore: Europe= Salamander as the animal emblem of King Francis I of France at the Ch√¢teau d'Azay-le-Rideau, Vienne, France Compared to Medieval depictions, Renaissance depictionsConrad Lycosthenes, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon, 1557 are characteristically more realistic, adhering more closely to the Classical description. In another example, a 1556 edition of the Book of Lambspring depicts the salamander as a white bird, while Lucas Jennis' 1625 version of the same illustration, included in the Musaeum Hermeticum, depicts it as a lizard-like animal with star-like markings (see right). Of all the traits ascribed to salamanders, the ones relating to fire have stood out most prominently. This connection probably originates from a behavior common to many species of salamander: hibernating in and under rotting logs. When wood was brought indoors and put on the fire, the creatures \\"mysteriously\\" appeared from the flames. The 16th-century Italian artist Benvenuto Cellini (1500‚Äì1571) famously recalled witnessing just such an appearance as a child in his autobiography.Thomas Bulfinch (1913). Age of Fable: Vols. I & II: Stories of Gods and Heroes: XXXVI. e. The Salamander According to some writers, the milky substance that a salamander exudes when frightened and which makes its skin moist gave rise to the idea that the salamander could withstand any heat and even put out fires. Another idea which is found in several Medieval and Renaissance works was that \\"Egyptian priests\\" used a hieroglyph which applied the figure of a salamander to represent a man who is burnt, or in other versions a man who has died from cold. This tradition is first found in the Hieroglyphica of Horapollo (Book 2, Ch. LXII), but it is not now considered to be an authentic representation of hieroglyphic usage. Early commentators in Europe often grouped \\"crawling things\\" (reptiles or reptilia in Latin) together and thus creatures in this group, which typically included salamanders (Latin salamandrae), dragons (Latin dracones or serpentes), and basilisks (Latin basilisci), were often associated, as in Conrad Lycosthenes' Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon of 1557. Leonardo da Vinci (1452‚Äì1519) wrote the following on the salamander: \\"This has no digestive organs, and gets no food but from the fire, in which it constantly renews its scaly skin. The salamander, which renews its scaly skin in the fire,‚Äîfor virtue.\\"Book XX: Humorous Writings, The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, edited by Jean Paul Richter, 1880. (online) (unconfirmed) Later, Paracelsus (1493‚Äì1541) suggested that salamanders were the elementals of fire,Theophrast von Hohenheim a.k.a. Paracelsus, S√§mtliche Werke: Abt. 1, v. 14, sec. 7, Liber de nymphis, sylphis, pygmaeis et salamandris et de caeteris spiritibus. Karl Sudhoff and Wilh. Matthie√üen, eds. Munich:Oldenbourg, 1933. which has had substantial influence on the role of salamanders in the occult. Paracelsus, contrary to the prevalent belief at the time, considered salamanders to be not devils, but similar to humans, only lacking a soul (along with giants, dwarves, mermaids, elves, and elemental spirits in human form). Francis I of France used the salamander as his symbol. The salamander is found throughout French folklore, although in differing form. In addition or sometimes instead of its fire symbolism, it was attributed a powerful poison. Some legends say that merely by falling into a well, it would poison the water, and by climbing a fruit tree, poison the fruit. Its highly toxic breath was reportedly enough to swell a person until their skin broke; in Auvergne, it supposedly did the same to herds of cattle. This gained it the name of \\"bellows breath\\". Like the real animal, the legendary salamander breathed seldom; unlike the real salamander, the only way to kill one was said to be to lock it in a confined space so that it breathed its own poison. The Bretons feared it so they did not dare say its real name for fear it would hear and then kill them. =Renaissance: Asian garments= Early travelers to China were shown garments supposedly woven from salamander hair or wool; the cloth was completely unharmed by fire. The garments had actually been woven from asbestos.Clare Browne, \\"Salamander's Wool: The Historical Evidence for Textiles Woven with Asbestos Fibre\\", Textile History, Volume 34, Number 1, May 2003, pp. 64‚Äì73(10) (abstract) According to T. H. White, Prester John had a robe made from it; the \\"Emperor of India\\" possessed a suit made from a thousand skins; and Pope Alexander III had a tunic which he valued highly. William Caxton (1481) wrote: \\"This Salemandre berithe wulle, of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not brenne in the fyre.\\" Holme (1688) wrote: \\"...I have several times put [salamander hair] in the Fire and made it red hot and after taken it out, which being cold, yet remained perfect wool.\\" An alternative interpretation was that this material was a kind of silk: A 12th-century letter supposedly from Prester John says, \\"Our realm yields the worm known as the salamander. Salamanders live in fire and make cocoons, which our court ladies spin and use to weave cloth and garments. To wash and clean these fabrics, they throw them into flames.\\" Friar also notes that Marco Polo believed that the \\"true\\" salamander was an incombustible substance found in the earth. In heraldry In European heraldry, the salamander is typically depicted as either a lizard or a dragon within a blazing fire. Francis I of France used a salamander as his personal emblem.Arthur Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, T.C. and E.C. Jack, London, 1909, p 230, https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft. Newts in witchcraft A newt is a type of salamander and their name is traditionally associated with witchcraft. In William Shakespeare's famous play Macbeth, the witches use \\"eye of newt\\" as the first ingredient stirred in their cauldron. Use of name The beast's ability to withstand fire has led to its name being applied to a variety of heating devices, including space heaters, ovens and cooking and blacksmithing devices, dating back at least to the 17th century.A Way with Words:Dessert Stomach, US public radio, 12 May 2018 (audio)Forged Iron Salamander at Jas.

In 2005, Newsweek Magazine included Juan Jos√© Guti√©rrez as one of the \\"10 Big Thinkgers For Big Business\\", along with Steven Case, Thomas Middelhoff, and Pierre Omidyar, among others. Additionally, he is a member of the Board of Directors of Fundaci√≥n Juan Bautista Guti√©rrez, CMI's social outreach organization that supports high impact education and health projects.  Family  Juan Jos√© Guti√©rrez Mayorga is the firstborn child of Dionisio Guti√©rrez, Sr. and Esperanza Mayorga. His grandfather, Juan Bautista Guti√©rrez, was one of the founders of Multi-Inversiones, S.A. In the 1920s, Juan Bautista Guti√©rrez opened a store in San Crist√≥bal Totonicap√°n, in western Guatemala. In 1936 he founded Molino Exc√©lsior (flour mill) and in 1965 he started poultry operations upon the purchase of Villalobos farm. It was in the 1970s when, as an initiative of his son Dionisio Guti√©rrez Sr., he entered the fried chicken business, creating Pollo Campero. On October 3, 1974. Dionisio Guti√©rrez Sr. and Alfonso Bosch both died in a plane crash near San Jos√© Pinula as they traveled to Honduras to provide assistance to Hurricane Fifi victims.  A Young Entrepreneur  Juan Jos√© Guti√©rrez Mayorga completed college in 1977. He started to work at Toledo, CMI's sausage and meat processing plant. When he was 23, he started to lead Pollo Campero.  International Expansion In 1982, at only 23, Juan Jos√© Guti√©rrez Mayorga became the manager of Pollo Campero. His experience at that point came from the meat industry. In 1982, Pollo Campero was not a restaurant chain yet, but rather a series of diners with 14 points of sale in Guatemala and 5 others in El Salvador. Pollo Campero was still part of the poultry business area of the corporation and operated as a vertical business that eliminated intermediaries and reached the consumer directly. In 1986 Pollo Campero opened a first restaurant in Coral Way, Miami. The operation lasted only a year. By 1990, the restaurant had expanded into the rest of Central America. And since 1988 it had grown by approximately 10 restaurants a year, mainly in Guatemala and El Salvador. Around the second half of the 1990s, the franchise model was introduced. The Pollo Campero brand was successfully positioned in countries including Panama, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Costa Rica, where it bought 51% of the shares. However, it continued to grow under the franchise model. In 2002, Pollo Campero was introduced in Los Angeles California. By 2005, Pollo Campero had 196 restaurants in 9 countries; 22 of the restaurants were located in El Salvador and in some of the largest US cities, such as Los Angeles, Washington, Dallas, and Houston. In 2006, Juan Jos√© Guti√©rrez Mayorga and the Pollo Campero team opened the first Pollo Campero restaurant in Spain.  Armed attack against him In 1995 Juan Jos√© Guti√©rrez Mayorga was the President of the Guatemalan Chamber of Industry. On May 16, 1995, during the night, he was the victim of a planned attack to kill him. It is believed that a group of around 10 armed people opened fire against the car he rode in. It was seriously damaged by the bullets, but thanks to the armoring, he was unharmed. Given the magnitude of the attack and its implications for civil society, Carlos Enrique Reynoso, Ministry of the Interior, rushed to the crime scene. Even the President of Guatemala at the time, Ramiro De Le√≥n, condemned the attack through an official statement. Several institutions demanded an investigation and condemned the attack against Juan Jos√© Guti√©rrez Mayorga. These included: C√°mara de Industria (Chamber of Industry), C√°mara de Periodismo de Guatemala (Chamber of Journalism), Federaci√≥n de C√°maras y Asociaciones Industriales Centroamericanas (Central American Federation of Industrial Chambers and Associations), Gremial de Exportadores de Productos No Tradicionales (Exporters‚Äô Association), Asociaci√≥n Nacional del Caf√© (Coffee National Association), C√°mara de Finanzas de Guatemala (Chamber of Finances), C√°mara de Comercio de Guatemala (Chamber of Commerce), Central General de Trabajadores de Guatemala (Workers‚Äô Association), Asociaci√≥n de Azucareros de Guatemala (Sugar Producers‚Äô Association), C√°mara del Agro de Guatemala (Chamber of Agriculture), among others.

The Marquette building was chosen for junior high school while the Aquinas building was chosen for senior high school. At the time 131 students were at the secondary level in Aquinas. The merger was due to increasing costs and the declining population of Lee County, the latter of which meant reduced numbers of pupils. The school received a different set of school colors and mascot, and the school administration allowed parents and students to have a say. In 2006 Cardinal Stritch High School of Keokuk merged into Holy Trinity High School. Principal Doris Turner, the first principal since the consolidation, retired in 2011.

He worked with the artists Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, as well as for patrons such as Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel and Charles I of England. Biography Vorsterman was born in Zaltbommel. Around 1618, Vorsterman joined Rubens' workshop. Between 1619 and 1621, Vorsterman was Rubens's sole engraver. At that time, Rubens had embarked upon a printmaking enterprise in which he enlisted Vorsterman to engrave a number of his notable paintings, to which Rubens appended personal and professional dedications to noteworthy individuals. In 1621, a violent dispute arose between Vorsterman and Rubens. It is not clear whether there was a physical altercation between the two men, but the situation was sufficiently serious for Rubens' lawyers to petition the authorities for a protection order, which was granted. The exact causes of the dispute are not known, but it has generally been assumed that its source was in the issue of ownership of the authorial rights to the prints engraved by Vorsterman on the basis of Rubens' designs. In 1621, Vorsterman began to add his own dedications to his engravings after Rubens' paintings. Before the dispute arose, their relationship had ostensibly been good since Rubens had agreed to be godfather to Vorsterman's eldest son Lucas Vorsterman II. The dispute ended the working relationship between the two men. In 1624, Vorsterman went to England and survived on the patronage of royalty and nobility. He returned to Antwerp in 1630 and was one of the printmakers selected by Van Dyck to engrave plates for his Iconography. Vorsterman executed twenty-two of the original eighty plates.Lucas Vorsterman (1595-1675) at the Fitzwilliam Museum Vorsterman lost his sight in his old age and he lived in poverty.

He is also a TV character in the 2007 television series Blood Ties, based on the Blood novels, that aired on Lifetime in the United States. On television, Henry is portrayed by Kyle Schmid. Brief character history Henry Fitzroy was a real person, the illegitimate son of Henry VIII of England and Elizabeth Blount, born in 1519 and died of what appeared to be consumption in 1536. He was Henry VIII's only acknowledged illegitimate child. (The surname prefix \\"Fitz-\\" means son, and \\"-roy\\" is an anglicization of the French \\"roi\\", or king.) The premise of this series is that the real cause of his illness and \\"death\\" was a vampire bite, and he rose from his grave to live on as a vampire, aging very slowly. He now lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he earns a living writing romance novels (in the books)/graphic novels (in the TV series). He is the author of the graphic novel \\"Blood Price\\", which is the title of the first novel of the series and of the pilot episode of the TV series. Henry has a complicated relationship with Vicki Nelson. Unlike most 'heroic' vampires in fiction, who reject their blood-drinking instincts and try to avoid drinking from humans, Henry is comfortable with who and what he is, but he maintains a regular policy of never killing his victims (he has killed on a few occasions, but attributes this to vampire instinct and has been shown to turn at least one victim when he took too much) and only drinking from the 'willing', with his primary food source being his lovers, who he feeds from during their liaisons, taking just enough to sustain himself without them noticing the loss. Henry's 'breed' of vampire possess a strong territorial instinct that prevents them from interacting with others of their kind on a regular basis after the teaching period of the first year of vampiric life has passed, with the result that vampires generally part ways after the older vampire has taught the new vampire how to survive undetected in humanity to avoid the conflict that would be inspired if they remained together; while this urge can be resisted, the effort required makes a long-term relationship impractical. Aside from this, Henry retains the traditional vampire powers of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and healing, with a vulnerability to sunlight and stakes, although garlic and holy relics have no effect on him and his reflection can still be seen in mirrors. Blood Books In the novels, Henry has a much more elaborate background, as there is more space in novels for background information. However, all of Henry's life before he met Vicki is seen only in flashbacks (and the odd short story), so it is rather sketchy. Henry was married to Lord Surrey's sister at age seventeen, but he met an intriguing woman named Christina, who turned out to be a vampire. Henry, wishing to spend his life (and more) with Christina, asked that she change him. She did, and Henry spent a year with her, whereupon their territorial natures forced them to split company. Unlike most nobles, Henry was buried in a pine box in an unmarked grave, instead of a tomb that is \\"easier to walk out of\\". Henry lived in Venice for some while (as Enrico), and fell in love with a woman named Ginevra Treschi. Ginevra was a young widow, with whom Henry had a year-long affair. Ginevra eventually had to choose between remarriage and a convent, and she chose the convent. She was tortured and murdered by the Inquisition in Venice, and Henry went on a rampage and killed everyone he could think of who was connected with her death. Henry returned to England in the nineteenth century, where he lived as a fashionable young man of leisure. One of his adventures in \\"What Manner of Man\\" involved stopping traitors from assisting France to invade England. At some point while living in England, Henry visited Egypt with a wealthy lady, where he climbed a pyramid (it was all the rage at the time) and was approached by several Egyptians who informed him that they knew he was an afreet, and told him to be gone. Henry also assisted in the Resistance during World War Two. He met Peter Heerkens while running in the Netherlands. He ended up in Toronto, where he eventually met Vicki Nelson, an ex-cop turned private investigator when she began to lose her sight due to retinitis pigmentosa. When Vicki began ending up with supernatural crimes, Henry assisted her. In Blood Price, they dealt with a college student who was summoning a demon. While fighting the demon, Henry lost too much blood to be revived by feeding solely on Vicki without taking her life. Vicki then brought in a former street kid, Tony Foster, to help. Henry became Tony's benefactor and lover and helped him get his own place to live and a job. In Blood Trail, Henry took Vicki out to London, Ontario to assist his werewolf friends with finding out who was trying to kill them, as they couldn't approach the police. Blood Lines involved an ancient Egyptian mummy, and Blood Pact had Vicki and Henry chasing after zombies in a non- traditional sense. Vicki was mortally wounded and Henry was forced to turn her into a vampire to save her life. Henry took Vicki and Tony and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. At the end of their year together, Vicki returned to her mortal lover, Mike Celluci, in Toronto. However, in Blood Debt Henry was then haunted by a ghost, and Vicki risked venturing onto Henry's territory to help him with the ghosts. It was difficult due to their constant urges to fight because of their predator instinct, but they managed. Smoke Books The Smoke novels focus on Tony Foster, but Henry is still a large part of his life, even though Tony moved out of Henry's apartment. In Smoke and Shadows, Tony, who works at a TV studio, discovered that the special effects technician was in fact a wizard from another world and that the Shadowlord from her world was invading Vancouver. With Henry's help, they defeated the Shadowlord. In Smoke and Mirrors, Tony became trapped in a haunted house, and Henry was unable to help. In Smoke and Ashes, Tony ran into a woman who was a demongate, and Henry stepped in again with knowledge of demons and his grimoire. TV series In the television adaption of the series, Henry isn't a writer, but a graphic novel artist, and he assists Vicki in her various supernatural requests. One difference from the book version of the series is that Henry was originally 5'6\\", being about four inches shorter than Vicki; in Blood Ties, Vicki is 5'6', Henry is 5'10\\", and Mike is 6'2\\" (essentially, Henry and Vicki have exchanged heights). In addition, the book describes Henry as having goldish-red hair, while the TV series depicts him with brown hair. Another difference is Henry's bisexual nature; though it's expressed somewhat periodically in the books, the TV series makes few, if any, references, with Henry's depicted romantic liaisons all being female. Finally, Tony Foster, Vicki's assistant in the books, has been replaced by Coreen Fennel, a client with ties to the Goth community who becomes Vicki's assistant after the second episode. Unlike Tony, with whom Henry is involved, Henry does not feed from Coreen (although he does feed from both Vicki and Mike, even if Mike was only because he was half-mad with hunger and pain), perhaps in part because of her fascination with magic, which he abhors due to his religious upbringing (although he still possesses a fair knowledge of various types of magic, allowing him to perform basic tracking spells and identify certain charms, even if outside expertise is required in more complex cases). During the 1700s, Henry was captured by the Spanish Inquisition, but was able to escape after he convinced a nun that he wasn't evil, although he was forced to turn her when he fed on her while starving. In the 1920s a woman he was involved with was killed and resurrected by a voodoo priest because Henry underestimated the power of the voodoo-animated zombies. He was involved with the mob in the 1960s, which resulted in him being left in a dump until he was able to drink enough blood from the inhabitants to heal. Henry- and other vampires in the series- possess the ability to give humans basic orders, such as telling one of his partners to leave after he has fed from her, although strong-willed individuals like Vicki can resist his control. Other details about his past are also provided, such as an artist who Henry remains in contact with due to his close relationship with the artist's mother (Although he was forced to use his mesmeric influence on her when she tried to flirt with him as he still saw her as a daughter); one case involves a priest who tortured Henry in the past and subsequently used diluted vampire blood to keep himself alive until the chance came to confront Henry again. On another occasion, Christina came to the city when a new vampire turned against her, Henry expressing disgust at her for having turned someone against their will and then abandoning him when he proved too difficult to control; Henry was finally forced to kill the new vampire when he proved unwilling to accept that he could be more than a monster.See List of Blood Ties episodes References Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century Category:Fictional vampires Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional characters with accelerated healing Category:Fictional writers Category:Fictional bisexual males Category:Literary characters introduced in 1991 ","title":"Henry Fitzroy (character)"},{"id":"11175965","text":"Simon Davies may refer to: *Simon Davies (privacy advocate), British advocate *Simon Davies (footballer, born 1974), Welsh international footballer (born in England), former Chester City F.C. manager *Simon Davies (footballer, born 1979), Welsh international footballer (born in Haverfordwest), whose clubs have included Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham *Simon Davies (English TV presenter) (born 1963), English designer, interior decorator and television presenter working in Sweden *Simon Davies (Welsh TV presenter) (born 1959), Welsh television presenter and former actor *Simon Davies (lawyer) (born 1967), British lawyer See also *Simon Davis (disambiguation) ","title":"Simon Davies"},{"id":"11175983","text":"\\"A view of the Orchestra with the Band of Music, the Grand Walk &c; in Marybone Gardens\\", engraving from a drawing by J.

Refreshments were another draw for the mid-century Marylebone Gardens, under the direction of the caterer John Trusler, who took over the management about 1756,Frank Kidson, \\"THE NURSERIES OF ENGLISH SONG I\\", The Musical Times 63 No. 952 (June 1922:394-395). and presented public dinners and breakfasts. His daughter made the popular Marylebone tarts and cakes. \\"Tarts of a twelvepenny size,\\" reads the advertisement of 1760, \\"will be made every day from one to three o'clock... The almond cheesecake will be always hot at one o'clock as usual.\\" Once the Great Room for balls and supper had been erected on the site (1739-40), breakfasts were added to the schedule.Wroth and Wroth 1896:95ff. Samuel Arnold, manager of Marylebone Gardens from 1769 Many of the foremost London musicians and composers including George Frideric Handel and James Hook performed works here, The original principal female singer was a Miss Faulkner and the orchestra was led by William Defesch. From 1763 to 1768 the Gardens were run by Thomas Lowe, who had been a singer at Vauxhall Gardens, with the musical management undertaken by Samuel Arnold who took over the ownership and management with the violinist Thomas Pinto which arrangement continued from 1769 to 1774. In 1758, under the direction of Trusler's son, the Gardens gave the English premiere of Pergolesi's opera La serva padrona (in translation). Hook was appointed organist and composer to the Gardens in 1769 and held an annual festival there every summer. The gardens were also famous for their regular firework displays, organised from 1772 to 1774 by Signor Torre. The Rose Tavern was later developed as a music hall and renamed \\"The Marylebone\\". It was the site of the studios of BBC London 94.9 until September 2009. The area was eventually built over in 1778.

Team prior to 2005, is Ford Motor Company's full factory World Rally Championship team. In its current form, it has been a competitor since the 1997 season, when Ford Motor Company's motorsport arm selected the Malcolm Wilson Motorsport company to run its factory team, entering the Ford Escort World Rally Car. The new team took their first victory in the 1997 Acropolis Rally.

Ford did not officially enter any cars for these seasons after winning the 1979 World Rally Championship season, they instead concentrated on development of the stillborn Ford Escort RS 1700T. However, Ari Vatanen did win the 1981 drivers championship in a Rothmans liveried Ford Escort RS, this was run by David Sutton Cars, and not an official works Ford World Rally team. =1985 season= The Boreham-based team were again missing from the 1985 season; the Ford Escort RS 1700T programme had been cancelled in 1983, and a new car was required to compete with Group B rivals like the Audi Quattro S1 and Peugeot 205 T16. Lessons learned from the RS 1700T programme were being used in the development of Ford's new rally weapon, the RS200, which would not hit the stages until 1986. =1986 season= Having spent time away from the sport developing the Ghia styled RS200, Ford made a return to the World Rallying stage at the second round in Sweden. Ford's new RS200 featured four-wheel drive, a turbocharged Cosworth BDT engine generating 450 bhp and a new blue and white Ford Motorsport livery. Stig Blomqvist's Lombard RAC Rally RS200 as seen at Race Retro 2014 Ford employed the services of Swedish drivers Stig Blomqvist and Kalle Grundel, but they would each only be entered on four rallies, in a season overshadowed with tragedy. Grundel achieved a podium finish on the RS200's debut in Sweden, a result that would not be bettered all season, the following round in Portugal saw an RS200 driven by Joaquim Santos leave the road, killing three spectators, Ford withdrew their entry for that rally. Fifth place for Grundel on the Lombard RAC Rally marked the end of the road for the RS200, as Group B rallying was banned for 1987, Ford finished fifth in the manufacturers championship behind rivals Peugeot, Lancia, Volkswagen and Audi. =1987 season= Ford started the post Group B era with the Sierra XR4x4, which had the benefits of 4WD, but was not as powerful as its rivals, and then replaced it with the RWD Sierra RS Cosworth which was more powerful, but lacked grip and traction on the gravel rallies that dominate the World Rally Championship. Stig Blomqvist was entered into the Monte Carlo, Swedish and New Zealand rounds of the championship in a white Texaco sponsored Ford Sierra XR4x4, he could only muster a 6th-place finish on his home rally, after being disqualified and crashing out of the other two rallies. The Sierra RS Cosworth proved to be far more successful in comparison, it would not win during 1987, but it did achieve a number of podium finishes. The car debuted on the Safari Rally, again driven by Stig Blomqvist, but would retire following a fire, its next outing would be on the island of Corsica. Blomqvist would again retire with turbo failure, but his teammates Carlos Sainz and Didier Auriol would fare much better, finishing 7th and 8th respectively. Ari Vatanen paired up with Blomqvist on the 1000 Lakes Rally in Finland, their speed and experience helping to negate some of the advantage of 4WD that their rivals enjoyed, they would finish 2nd and 3rd respectively.http://www.juwra.com/finland_1987_results.html Ford would finish the season with 2nd and 3rd places for Blomqvist and Jimmy McRae, again against more capable rival machinery. Sporadic appearances throughout the season with cars that were compromised in one way or another meant that Stig Blomqvist would finish in a lowly 7th position in the drivers championship, whilst Ford could only manage to finish 5th in the manufacturers championship. =1988 season= Ford entered the 1988 World Rally Championship season using both the XR4x4 and the Sierra RS Cosworth models, the Texaco sponsorship had gone, and the cars now featured a corporate blue and white striped Ford colour scheme, similar to that seen on the Ford RS200 in 1986. The services of Stig Blomqvist, Carlos Sainz and Didier Auriol were retained from 1987, each driver being entered on the rallies in Portugal, Finland and Italy. Blomqvist would also be entered for Round 2 in Rally Sweden, whilst Sainz and Auriol were entered in Corsica. A three car team of Blomqvist, Sainz and Mark Lovell were entered for the season closing Lombard RAC Rally. A replica of Auriol's winning car being driven at Race Retro 2014 Blomqvist kicked off Ford's season with 2nd place on his home round in a Rallysport Sweden prepared Sierra XR4x4, the best result for the 4WD Ford, and something that would not be bettered. The Ford Sierra RS Cosworth would return for Round 3 in Portugal, and Blomqvist would use it to finish in 5th place, but only after Sainz and Auriol had both retired from the event. Ford would return to winning ways in Corsica; Didier Auriol steering his green and white Panach' sponsored Sierra around the island ahead of opposition from Lancia, for his first victory, and Ford's 23rd in the top flight. Sainz would collect points for 5th in Corsica and then 6th in Finland, another rally where Auriol would finish on the podium, this time in 3rd place, two places ahead of Blomqvist. Auriol's luck would run out on the San Remo rally in Italy, suffering an accident that would force him to retire, Sainz and Blomqvist would finish low down the order in 5th and 7th places respectively. For the final round in Great Britain Swedish and Spanish crews would finish in 6th and 7th places, whilst Lovell would finish in a disappointing 17th place in his bright yellow Sound 2000 sponsored Ford Sierra RS Cosworth. Ford would finish the season 2nd behind Lancia in the Manufacturers Championship, with a total of 79 points.1988 World Rally Championship season =1989 season= It was evident from previous seasons that Ford did not have a car that was fully capable of challenging Lancia and their Delta Integrale, so for the 1989 season the Blue Oval was absent for most of the rallies, entering cars for the Corsica and Lombard RAC Rally rounds only. Three cars were entered in Corsica, a Q8 liveried car for Gianfranco Cunico, a yellow Sound 2000 sponsored car for Mark Lovell and a third car for French driver Pierre-C√©sar Baroni. Lovell would retire after suffering from a misfire, Baroni would retire after an accident, and Cunico would go on to finish 7th overall. The Italian driver would suffer the misfortune of retiring after an accident on his second Ford outing in Great Britain. Ford would finish 13th in the Manufacturers standings after scoring just six points for the season. =1990 season= 1990 Q8 Ford livery Results over the past few seasons had proved one thing; in order to return to winning ways Ford would need a powerful, turbocharged car with 4WD capabilities. The 3-door Sierra RS Cosworth was no longer being sold by Ford, so they instead utilised the new Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4 4-door saloon model, which went on sale in 1990. The new car was still powered by a Cosworth developed turbocharged engine, but delays sourcing a suitable gearbox meant that it would not be used until the end of the 1990 World Rally Championship season. The team retained the Q8 sponsorship from the 1989 World Rally Championship season, the cars again being painted blue with cream coloured bumpers, but the driver line-up had almost completely changed, only Franco Cunico remained. He was now joined by Pentti Airikkala and Malcolm Wilson who had been teammates at the Rothmans Rally Team 10 years previously. Ford's season kicked off in Finland, where all three drivers left the start ramp, but would not see the finish, Airikkala suffered a gearbox problem, Cunico suffered an accident and Wilson withdrew after a service infringement.http://www.juwra.com/finland_1990_results.html Results weren't much better on Cunico's home rally in Italy, where he and Wilson again both retired and Airikkala finished in a disappointing 11th place. Airikkala was seeded in car number 1 for the final round in Great Britain, but he and Wilson would again retire, the only Ford finisher being Alessandro Fiorio who had replaced Cunico. Ford would finish 8th in the championship, with a total of 22 points. =1991 season= 1991 Q8 Ford & Autoglass livery as used on the Lombard RAC Rally The 1991 World Rally Championship season was an opportunity for Ford to push for victory again, and to evolve the Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4; lessons learned on the stages would be used to simultaneously develop the Ford Escort RS Cosworth. The cars were again predominantly blue with title sponsorship from Q8, but now featured extra sponsors like Autoglass and Noberasco, which were displayed in white sections on the bonnet and rear flanks of the car. British driver Malcolm Wilson returned, and was joined by a relatively unknown French driver called Francois Delecour. Both drivers were entered on six of the European rounds of the Championship, with Delecour also entering the Catalonia Rally in Spain. A third car was shared by Alessandro Fiorio and Gwyndaf Evans, and a single car was made available for Ari Vatanen at Rally Finland. Delecour surprised many with his pace on the season-opening Monte-Carlo Rally; after a spirited drive, he finished in third place, leading home teammates Wilson and Fiorio, who finished 7th and 10th respectively. This feat was not to be repeated in Portugal, where all three cars retired after going off the road. Delecour also failed to finish in Corsica after suffering differential issues, while Wilson finished in fifth place.http://www.juwra.com/corsica_1991_results.html The rough and rugged stages of the Acropolis Rally were renowned for breaking cars, and that turned out to be the case for the Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4 as all three cars retired with mechanical ailments. A single car was entered for Vatanen on his home rally in Finland; he kept the car on the road and won eight stages on his way to 7th place. The San Remo rally would prove to be more fruitful than the Acropolis had been when the Q8 cars returned, all three cars would finish this rally in the top ten, with Delecour finishing 4th overall ahead of Fiorio in 9th and Wilson in 10th. 1991 was the inaugural year for the Catalunya rally and was only registered as a round of the drivers championship, two cars were entered, one for Delecour and the other for Jose Maria Bardolet, a pairing that would secure 3rd and 4th positions respectively. To end the season, Gwyndaf Evans joined Wilson and Delecour. It would not be a happy hunting ground for the British drivers on their home rally, the Lombard RAC Rally, both drivers retiring in the forests of Wales on day 2,http://www.juwra.com/rac_rally_1991_results.html their French teammate would go on to finish in 6th place. A winless season left Ford finishing the manufacturers championship in fourth place, with 54 points. =1992 season= 1992 Mobil 1 livery as used on the Monte Carlo Rally There were a number of changes for the 1992 World Rally Championship season at the Boreham based Ford squad, the most obvious being the new driver line-up. Francois Delecour remained at the team, but he was now joined by double World Champion Miki Biasion, who Ford hoped would add the final ingredients for a championship push. Q8 no longer sponsored the Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4 cars, which were now painted with a white and blue Mobil 1 livery. New technical rules were in place which reduced the turbo restrictor diameter from 40mm, down to 38mm, and in the background, development work continued on the Ford Escort RS Cosworth. Ford would follow a similar strategy to 1991 by electing to enter the European gravel and Tarmac rounds only. Biasion and Delecour were paired up on all of the rallies that Ford entered except Catalunya, where Delecour was joined by Jose Maria Bardolet, and in Great Britain, where Biasion was joined by Malcolm Wilson. Delecour kicked off his season by winning 5 stages in Monte Carlo on his way to 4th place, twelve minutes and four places ahead of his Italian teammate,http://www.juwra.com/monte_carlo_1992_results.html who would have a better result in Portugal, finishing 2nd behind his former teammate Juha Kankkunen. Engine troubles had denied Delecour any points in Portugal, but it would hold for both he and Biasion on the Acropolis rally, where the pair finished 5th and 3rd respectively. The fast, flowing Finnish stages of the 1000 Lakes Rally allowed Biasion to continue his string of good results, he would collect more points by finishing in 5th place, Delecour however, seemed to be suffering the bad luck in the team as he finished the rally off the road, these gremlins would strike both Delecour and Bardolet in Catalunya. Biasion and Wilson would fare much better on the Lombard RAC Rally, with both cars finishing in the top ten. Ford finished the championship with 94 points and 3rd position, and would retire the Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4, as a new car would be ready for 1993. =1993 season= Francois Delecour's 1993 Ford Escort RS Cosworth in Rally Portugal livery Ford introduced the Escort RS Cosworth. =1994 season= Development of the Escort RS Cosworth continued during the 1994 season; a sequential gearbox and an antilag system being introduced, along with new larger 18 inch wheels for Tarmac rounds. This would be the final year at Ford for double champion Miki Biasion, his previous form had not continued and he would not finish higher than third place all season. His teammate Francois Delecour demonstrated how the car should be driven, by winning the season opening Monte-Carlo Rally, he would then miss four months of the season after breaking both of his ankles. A third car was driven on a number of rounds by Bruno Thiry, and a number of other drivers including future champion Tommi Makinen. The Finnish driver would only drive the Escort RS Cosworth on his home rally that year, but he would secure a second win for the Ford team. Thiry would finish the season with two more points than his more illustrious teammate Biasion, but the team's combined performance would leave them third in the championship behind Japanese rivals, Toyota and Subaru. =1995 season= Commitments in the Formula 1 and BTCC championships meant that the rally budget at Boreham was significantly reduced, as a consequence Ford were not officially entered into the 1995 season as a manufacturer, the work instead being contracted out to RAS Sport of Belgium. =1996 season= Bruno Thiry steers the Repsol Ford Escort RS Cosworth through the stages of the 1996 Rally Catalunya Ford entered the 1996 season as full manufacturer entry, again with the Escort RS Cosworth, but now with backing from Repsol and a new lead driver, in the form of Carlos Sainz. Double champion Sainz had joined the Ford team after losing the battle for the 1995 championship to Colin McRae, he would have a number of new teammates at Ford, starting with Francois Delecour at Rally Sweden, and then former champion Stig Blomqvist at the Safari Rally in Kenya. Welsh driver Gwyndaf Evans, which his son Elfyn currently driving for the team, drove the second car in Rally Indonesia, it would be his only appearance before replaced by Bruno Thiry for the rest of the season. Sainz's pace was undeniable, even in the ageing Escort RS Cosworth, as he would go on to win the Indonesian Rally and finish on the podium on every rally he finished, however, retirements in Kenya, Finland and on his home round in Spain would leave him finishing third in the championship. Thiry finished on the podium for the final two rounds in Italy and Spain, results that would help him to finish sixth in the drivers standings. 1996 would prove to be the swan song year for both the Escort RS Cosworth and the preparation of works Ford cars at Boreham, resulting in the team finishing third in the manufacturers championship. =1997 season= Juha Kankkunen heading for 2nd place on the 1997 Rally Finland 1997 saw the introduction of the Ford Escort WRC, which was now being run by the Cumbria- based M-Sport team, rather than being based at the long term Ford Motorsport home of Boreham. The team continued to be sponsored by Repsol, with a distinctive white and orange livery, and the car featured dramatic changes to the engine, as it was the Escort Group A car's main weak point, and also had several other cosmetic changes including a new front bumper and rear spoiler. On the driver front the team continued to be led by double World Rally champion Carlos Sainz, who drove all fourteen rounds, winning the Acropolis and Indonesia rallies, also often finishing on the podium. He would eventually finish third in the championship. The second seat was initially filled by German driver Armin Schwarz, however, he was replaced after the sixth round in Corsica, following some disappointing results, and the fact that his sponsorship money had not arrived. His understudy was a more than capable Juha Kankkunen, who completed the season in the second car, finishing on the podium on no less than six occasions. A third car was entered at the Network Q RAC Rally for Angelo Medghini. Ford finished second in the manufacturers championship, being sandwiched by champions Subaru and third placed Mitsubishi. =1998 season= Bruno Thiry cuts a corner on the 1998 Network Q Rally in his Ford Escort WRC 1998 marked the final season of the Escort WRC, with that year's Rally of Great Britain being its last event, ending the model name's thirty-year association with factory-backed international rallying. The team retained the services of four-time world champion Finn, Juha Kankkunen and Belgian Bruno Thiry, a championship mainstay and veteran pilot of previous Ford rallying models, including the Escort RS Cosworth. Carlos Sainz had left the team at the end of the 1997 season, and taken the Repsol S.A. sponsorship with him. The Escort WRC started the Monte-Carlo Rally with a new blue and white Ford livery, and a dedication to ex-Ford rally legend Roger Clark who died earlier in the year. As events transpired, neither driver would manage to mark the Escort's swansong year with a final victory. The Escort still proved, frustratingly for the championship hopeful Kankkunen, persistently ineffective on asphalt rounds of the calendar, woes for which not even Thiry's performances could compensate. A late injury to the Belgian provided an early season cameo role for 1981 world champion Ari Vatanen, who finished third at the Safari Rally, behind compatriot Kankkunen and first-time world rally victor for Mitsubishi, Richard Burns. Kankkunen eventually scored sufficient points and podiums, including second ahead of Thiry in Britain, to finish fourth in the 1998 drivers' standings, although, with the announcement of the looming high-profile arrival of Colin McRae to the team for the following year, this success did not deter the Finn from deciding to leave the M-Sport outfit, both he and Thiry proceeding to sign Subaru contracts for 1999. =1999 season= 1999 Ford Focus WRC Colin McRae The Ford and M-Sport-built Ford Focus WRC replaced the Escort WRC for 1999. It debuted on the Monte Carlo Rally in January, with Colin McRae and Simon Jean-Joseph driving the two Martini Racing-liveried works machines. It set several fastest stage times and McRae finished a provisional third place on the stages, only to be disqualified later due to an illegal water pump. McRae gave the Focus its first win two events later at the Safari Rally, in Kenya, finishing over 15 minutes ahead of the second placed Toyota Corolla WRC of Didier Auriol. Although McRae then immediately followed up this success with a victory at the next round in Portugal, the Scot's title chances faded amid reliability problems with the new car and a series of costly shunts. McRae finished sixth in the drivers' standings. During this debut season, many drivers drove the second Focus of the team ‚Äì France's Simon Jean-Joseph for some tarmac events, 2003 World Rally champion Petter Solberg of Norway (who replaced R√•dstr√∂m in the Safari Rally) and Thomas R√•dstr√∂m of Sweden on loose-surface rounds (except Safari who was replaced by Petter Solberg). =2000 season= 2000 WRC Acropolis Day3 Sainz His former role at Toyota now redundant after his former team's withdrawal as manufacturers' champions at the end of the 1999 season, double world champion Spaniard Carlos Sainz chose to return to his 1997 team for the 2000 season, joining the incumbent Colin McRae. Both men drove the Focus WRC at every event of the season. They finished 3rd and 4th respectively in the drivers championship, albeit only managing to bring Ford 2nd place in the manufacturers title race behind Peugeot. Once again, bit-part driver Piero Liatti was called upon to help improve Ford's points returns on asphalt. =2001 season= Colin McRae & Nicky Grist guide their Martini sponsored Focus WRC through a stage of the 2001 Rally Finland. McRae and Sainz were joined for the 2001 season by a regular third driver in the returning Ford favourite of the early to mid-1990s, Frenchman Fran√ßois Delecour. McRae's season oscillated between a protracted pointless run on the season's first few rounds, including retirement on the season-opening Monte Carlo Rally while leading the event from Tommi M√§kinen, and a run of three consecutive victories on the Argentine, Cypriot and Greek events, the latter placing him as joint leader of the championship with Makinen midway through the season. Leading the points standings outright upon entering his final home round, however, McRae led in the initial stages only to crash out of the event, allowing a consistently points-scoring Richard Burns to sneak past him for the title. Ford also lost their opportunity for the manufacturers' title on this event, as rivals Peugeot secured a decisive 1‚Äì2 finish with Marcus Gr√∂nholm and Harri Rovanper√§. Sainz, meanwhile, endured a winless but not wholly uncompetitive season, even remaining an outsider for the title entering the final event. A crash of his own put paid to such ambitions, with the Spaniard slumping to sixth place in the points standings, with 33 points. =2002 season= Colin McRae & Nicky Grist's 2002 Ford Focus RS WRC at the Autosport Show, January 2013 McRae and Sainz regrouped for both drivers' final seasons with Ford in 2002. Simultaneously, youngster Markko M√§rtin replaced Delecour as the team's third driver, having found himself crowded out by the presence of Richard Burns and Petter Solberg at former team, Subaru. Sainz's third place in the championship beat his Scottish teammate's fourth place in the standings. His only victory of the year came on that year's Rally Argentina, which he inherited after the unlikely exclusion of both of the initially 1‚Äì2 finishing dominant works Peugeots of Marcus Gr√∂nholm and Englishman Burns. McRae began his own season with fourth place on the Rally Monte Carlo, but he suffered an injury to his hand when he crashed out on the Tour de Corse, which left him hampered and struggling to a single-point-scoring finish on the following tarmac round in Spain. Injury worries for Sainz, meanwhile, came not from himself, but in the form of long-time co-driver Luis Moya, who was forced to end his unbroken year-on-year chain of appearances with his compatriot in order to recuperate, with Marc Marti stepping in for the double world champion's home rally. Intrusive spectator parking on the event blinded Sainz, causing him to eventually crash out. With the Fords having initially dominated the stage times on the first rough gravel event of the year in Cyprus particularly through McRae, M√§rtin and Fran√ßois Duval, successive retirements left McRae as the sole occupier of the lead for the Blue Oval, which he lost after a number of unfortunate shunts which eventually left himself holding on to a mere sixth place overall, and the two factory Peugeots as 1‚Äì2 finishers on this event. After Sainz's perhaps fortuitous Argentinian win, McRae resumed his role as rally winner on the Acropolis and Safari rallies. The first success came despite initially being unexpectedly led on the stages by an imperious M√§rtin, while the latter, achieved on the landmark occasion of the fiftieth running of the fabled endurance event, and its last at World Rally Championship level, in retrospect proved to be the last career victory for McRae and British navigator Nicky Grist, ironically on the day on which the Scot became the first world championship driver to reach the quarter-century mark of individual WRC wins, and came to stand alone as the most successful driver in the history of the World Rally Championship. Despite the profile of these attainments, both McRae and Sainz were to leave the team at the end of the year as teammates to the then less seasoned S√©bastien Loeb at new championship full-timers, Citro√´n. =2003 season= In the absence of the departed McRae and Sainz, Ford opted to promote their younger supporting drivers, Estonian Markko M√§rtin and Belgian Fran√ßois Duval, to their top two seats. A comparatively thorough redesign of the Focus debuted at the 2003 Rally New Zealand, where M√§rtin in particular proved immediately competitive, leading only to later be forced into retirement with engine problems. The team's new leader did score his first of five career rally victories on that year's Acropolis Rally, however, (notwithstanding a dramatic mid-stage moment for he and navigator Michael Park, when the car's bonnet unexpectedly flew up), as well as becoming only the third non-Scandinavian victor of the Rally Finland, formerly the 1,000 Lakes Rally. The junior Duval, meanwhile, as had been publicly predicted by team boss Malcolm Wilson, secured a podium finish on this year's Tour de Corse, having scored his first ever podium finish earlier in the year in Turkey. The two drivers finished the season in 4th and 9th places respectively in the drivers' standings. =2004 season= Fran√ßois Duval ‚Äì 2004 Rally Finland M√§rtin and Duval again drove the two works Fords in 2004. M√§rtin managed to win the French, Spanish and Mexican rallies, giving him third place in the overall championship. Both drivers left at the end of the season, to join Peugeot (M√§rtin) and Citro√´n (Duval). =2005 season= Toni Gardemeister steers his Focus RS WRC 04 through the rugged stages of the 2005 Acropolis Rally The 2005 season saw Ford take on two relatively inexperienced drivers; Finn Toni Gardemeister and Czech Roman Kresta. Gardemeister achieved podiums at the Monte Carlo Rally, Rally Sweden, Acropolis Rally and the Tour de Corse. Kresta's best individual rally result was sixth, which he achieved on five events. The duo respectively finished in 4th and 8th places in the drivers' championship standings. The team also successfully introduced its 2006 car, the Ford Focus RS WRC 06 at the final rally of the year in Australia, where despite a few teething troubles, it was immediately quick as Gardemeister and Kresta both achieved a fastest stage time during the rally. =2006 season= Mikko Hirvonen at the 2006 Rally Japan. The team's entrants for the 2006 season are a new-look, all-Finnish team of 2000 and 2002 champion Marcus Gr√∂nholm, codriven by Timo Rautiainen, and the youngster Mikko Hirvonen, who renewed his link with the M-Sport run team for the first time since 2003, codriven by Jarmo Lehtinen. Gr√∂nholm joined the team from Peugeot, with whom, as planned, he ended his association after the joint withdrawal from the sport of both PSA Group marques. He won his first two events for the team, on the Monte Carlo Rally and the Swedish Rally, but was closely shadowed on both of them by the two-time champion and now driver with semi-works Kronos Citroen, S√©bastien Loeb, who was soon to assert himself sufficiently in order to overtake the Finn in the points standings. Despite further victories, including Greece and Finland, Gr√∂nholm never regained the championship lead from the Frenchman and with the exception of Hirvonen in Australia, the two proved the only two drivers worthy of individual rally victories all season. Although with four rounds remaining and a 34-point lead, Loeb's injury from a mountain-biking accident shortly after the Cyprus Rally appeared to offer Gr√∂nholm a chance to close the deficit, the Finn's title challenge was finally mathematically ended with a crash on the penultimate round in Australia. His team, however, were to benefit from Loeb's absence against a now weakened Kronos Citroen left to depend on their two inexperienced Spaniards, Xavier Pons and Daniel Sordo (although the team initially called upon Colin McRae to substitute for Loeb on their first event without him, in Turkey). Ford, already gaining on the points lead due to the combined proficiency on gravel of their two senior drivers, soon reclaimed a championship lead they were never to lose, achieving its greatest success in winning the manufacturer's title, the first such win for Ford since 1979. =2007 season= Marcus Gr√∂nholm ‚Äì 2007 Rally Catalunya The team's primary entrants for 2007 were unchanged from 2006. After watching his opponent of the previous year, S√©bastien Loeb, return to winning ways on the official return of the 2003‚Äì2005 manufacturers' championship-winning factory Citroen team on the season's curtain-raiser in Monte Carlo, Gr√∂nholm followed up his own third place by winning for the first time that season in Sweden in February, and led his opponent, now driving a newly homologated Citro√´n C4 WRC, in the drivers' standings over the championship's post-Rally Finland summer break (an event also incidentally won by Gr√∂nholm, for a record-beating seventh time, to further extend his points lead). Unfortunately for the drivers' championship ambitions of both the Blue Oval concern and Gr√∂nholm, however, having announced his impending retirement from WRC competition at the end of the season, the elder Finn was to suffer an early exit on Rally Japan. Gr√∂nholm then crashed his Focus (knocking himself briefly unconscious) on the tarmac stages of the inaugural Rally Ireland and penultimate round of the year. Combined with adversary Loeb winning, this meant Gr√∂nholm would surrender his championship lead, leaving him with an almost impossible points deficit to overhaul at the season-ending Wales Rally GB. It culminated in the Frenchman, settling for a safe third on the rally to the Finn's second, triumphing in the second long points duel between the pair in consecutive years. Ford, however, aided by supporting teammate Hirvonen's continued superiority on loose-surface events over his Citroen counterpart Daniel Sordo, sealed a successful defence of the Constructors' Championship. Meanwhile, Hirvonen, for his part, in addition to ending the season in style by topping the timesheets after the three days' competition in Wales, had also earlier taken his second and third career world rally victories in Norway and Japan. At the half way stage of the 2007 World Rally Championship, a joint venture between BP-Ford and the Abu Dhabi Tourism Board was announced to bring a third official Ford Focus RS World Rally Car to the team's campaign. Khalid AlQassimi and co-driver Nicky Beech contested the Neste Oil Rally Finland, ADAC Rallye Deutschland, Rally RACC Catalunya-Costa Daurada and Rally Ireland. For their work in the 2007 season, BP Ford and M-Sport received the Rally Business of the Year Award from the Motorsport Industry Association. =2008 season= Ford Focus RS WRC 08 Mikko Hirvonen and co-driver Jarmo Lehtinen resumed the implicit role within the team of the Cumbria outfit's leading crew for the 2008 season, after Marcus Gr√∂nholm and co-driver Timo Rautiainen elected to retire following the 2007 season, with the more experienced Finn later to be found dabbling for Ford in rallycross and maintaining his links with the BP-Ford WRT team in an \\"ambassadorial role\\". Hirvonen was joined in the new-look M-Sport line-up by another fellow Finnish driver, Jari-Matti Latvala, who stepped into the vacant berth from his former spot at the satellite Stobart Ford team. Khalid AlQassimi returned with a programme of ten events on the 2008 WRC calendar aboard a third car. His co-driver, Nicky Beech, was replaced by Michael Orr, former co-driver to Matthew Wilson. The season got off to a promising start for both Finnish drivers, with Hirvonen taking second to the seemingly omnipresent Loeb on the Monte Carlo Rally in January, before Latvala shattered Henri Toivonen's long-standing record as youngest World Rally Championship- qualifying event winner by outpacing Hirvonen to victory on the following Rally Sweden. Hirvonen collected his first win of the year on the Jordan Rally and led Latvala in an astutely tactically judged Ford 1‚Äì2 on Rally Turkey to assert a slender points lead over Citroen's Loeb heading into both Finns' home round of the Championship in August. Unfortunately for Ford, however, neither Hirvonen nor Latvala were able to defeat Loeb, with the now dominant Frenchman proceeding to record his eighth and ninth victories of the season on the New Zealand, Spanish and Corsican rallies. For the latter two, asphalt rounds, team boss Malcolm Wilson drafted in, in place of Latvala, pacy Belgian and one-time full-time pilot for the Ford team, Fran√ßois Duval, in order to maximise the team's points haul on a surface traditionally favourable to their French rivals. Hirvonen rolls on Wales Rally GB, 2008. Although Hirvonen did return to winning form to head a Ford 1‚Äì2 with Latvala in Japan, it was at the same event where Loeb finished third to finally clinch the drivers' title, although the team did close in to within eleven points of Citroen in the manufacturers' title race, with a possible total of eighteen still available, as the season-ending Wales Rally GB loomed in December. =2009 season= Hirvonen, Latvala and Al-Qassimi were retained in the team. Rival team Citro√´n got their season off to a good start, S√©bastien Loeb winning all of the first five rallies. After finishing third in Ireland, Hirvonen scored four consecutive second-place finishes, but retired in Argentina with an engine problem. The team won their first rally of the season in Italy, Latvala beating Hirvonen. Hirvonen then took four consecutive victories, giving him a five-point lead over Loeb with two rounds to go. Hirvonen finished third in Spain and took a one-point championship lead to the finale in Great Britain. However, Loeb beat him to the victory in Britain, winning the championship. Hirvonen finished second in the standings, with Latvala fourth. Ford finished second in the Manufacturers' championship behind Citro√´n. =2010 season= Mikko Hirvonen tackles a night stage on the 2010 Wales Rally GB Hirvonen, Latvala and Al-Qassimi were retained again in the team for 2010. The team made a strong start, Hirvonen winning in Sweden with Latvala in third. However, the Fords struggled at the next round in Mexico, Hirvonen and Latvala only managing fourth and fifth respectively as Citro√´ns filled the podium. Hirvonen went off the road on the opening day of the Jordan Rally, but Latvala was fighting for victory. Both teams used tactics to determine the road order, Loeb eventually winning for Citro√´n. Hirvonen finished third in Turkey, while Latvala beat S√©bastien Ogier to win in New Zealand after Loeb made errors and Hirvonen struggled for pace. Citro√´n filled the podium again in Portugal, Hirvonen the leading Ford in fourth. =2011 season= Mikko Hirvonen ‚Äì 2011 Rally Australia A change in the technical rules for the 2011 season meant that the Focus RS WRC had been replaced by the Fiesta RS WRC; the Fiesta name had not used by Ford for a rally car since the 1979 season, where Roger Clark and Ari Vatanen were entered for the Monte Carlo Rally. The new car retained the Abu Dhabi sponsorship that it had sported with the Focus, along with the driver line up of Mikko Hirvonen, Jari-Matti Latvala and Khalid Al-Qassimi. The main change from the new technical rules centred on the engine displacement; it being reduced from 2000cc turbo to 1600cc turbo, this reflected the changes being introduced to road cars at the same time. The season started well, with Hirvonen winning the Swedish Rally, and Latvala finishing third, but Ford would have to wait until round 10 in Australia for the Fiesta to win again. Despite a promising start the Fiesta would only win three rallies during the season, the third victory being with Latvala in the legendary forests of Wales Rally GB. Hirvonen and Latvala would each achieve six additional podium finishes, allowing them to finish second and fourth in the drivers championships respectively. Ford finished second in the manufacturers championship, twenty seven points behind eventual winners Citro√´n. =2012 season= 2012 Wales Rally GB water splash Ford's participation in the World Rally Championship prior to the start of the 2012 season was in doubt due to the continued global financial crisis, but an announcement at the eleventh hour was enough to secure their entry. The Abu Dhabi sponsorship deal had finished at the end of the 2011 season, and the Fiesta RS WRC now featured a predominantly Ford blue and white livery. Jari- Matti Latvala remained in the Ford stable and was now joined by 2003 champion Petter Solberg, who replaced the Citro√´n bound Mikko Hirvonen. The season could have started very well for Ford; Latvala was leading the Monte-Carlo Rally with raw pace, until he crashed out, handing victory to Loeb. Latvala tried to make up for this error by winning the next round in Sweden, but he and Ford would not win again until the tenth round at Wales Rally GB. Solberg showed reasonable pace at the start of the season, adapting to a new car but in the end would never finish higher than third position. Dani Sordo also made an appearance for the Ford team at Rally Argentina, replacing Latvala who had been injured during training, he showed good pace, but retired on the final leg. Latvala ended the season in third place, 116 points behind Loeb. Solberg finished in fifth place behind his younger compatriot, Mads √òstberg. Ford again finished second behind Citro√´n in the manufacturers championship, another disappointing result for the blue oval brand. At the end of the 2012 season Ford announced that it would be ending its \\"sponsorship\\" of the Ford World Rally team, thus ending a seventeen-year link with the M-Sport squad. =Withdrawal from WRC as a World Rally Team= On Monday 26 November 2012, M-Sport announced that sponsorship had been secured from the State of Qatar and that Mads √òstberg and Nasser Al-Attiyah would be driving for the 2013 season. On Saturday 15 December 2012, M-Sport also announced that Evgeny Novikov and Thierry Neuville would be joining the Qatar M-Sport World Rally Team. Although the team will be rallying with the Ford Fiesta RS WRC, and may receive technical support from the Ford Motor Company, they will not be classed as the Ford World Rally Team. =2018 season= Following Ford‚Äôs withdrawal from the WRC at the end of 2012, the presence of Ford in the championship has been down to its former rally partner, British-based preparation firm M-Sport. For 2018 the Ford name came back on the FIA entry list and the manufacturer will play a more active role in the WRC. Following their 2017 championship without Ford support S√©bastien Ogier successfully defended his drivers title but lost the manufacturers title to Toyota.

He was also a member of the Oregon Rangers militia and fought in the Cayuse War. Early life Waldo was born in 1800 in Harrison County, Virginia to Jedediah Waldo and Mary Polly Porter.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. (Harrison County became part of West Virginia during the American Civil War when a portion of Virginia joined the Union as a new state.) After turning 19 years of age Waldo migrated to Missouri where he entered the lumber business. Then in 1825 he married Malinda Lunsford and they moved to St. Clair County, Missouri. He was descended from a Wiltshire, England family who migrated to Massachusetts in the American colonies in the 17th century.Waldo Lincoln, Genealogy of the Waldo Family, Press of Charles Hamilton, 1902, p. 270. Oregon In 1843, the Waldo family traveled the Oregon Trail to Oregon Country. They traveled with their neighbors the Applegates, including Jesse Applegate. Daniel spent most of the trip in a carriage on the journey due to poor health, but the group reach the Willamette Valley in 1843 and settled east of Salem, Oregon in an area now known as the Waldo Hills. The following year Daniel was elected to serve as a legislator in the Provisional Government.Oregon Legislative Assembly (3rd Pre- Provisional) 1844 Meetings. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on January 30, 2008. Waldo was a member of the provisional government when Oregon's controversial black exclusion laws were enacted. Later life and family With the Cayuse War in 1848, Daniel fought against the Native Americans in Eastern Oregon. Earlier he had been a member of the Oregon Rangers volunteer militia.Brown, J. Henry (1892). Political History of Oregon: Provisional Government. The Lewis & Dryden Printing Co.: Portland. His second oldest son William Waldo would later be president of the Oregon State Senate, and another son, John B. Waldo, would serve on the Oregon Supreme Court. During the 1860s Daniel was involved with promoting the state‚Äôs wool industry. Daniel Waldo died in Salem, Oregon on September 10, 1880. Slavery and family ties Some publications have speculated that Daniel Waldo brought several slaves to Oregon in 1843, including an African-American child named America. America Waldo, who married Richard Bogle in 1863 and became America Waldo Bogle, is believed by the Bogle family to be the daughter of Daniel Waldo. More recent research shows it may be Daniel's brother Joseph Waldo who brought slaves with him to Oregon in 1846, and that he is more likely to be America's father. This is based on contemporary evidence during the lifetime of Daniel and America indicating Daniel Waldo did not bring any slaves to Oregon in 1843, and on numerous reports by America Waldo and her immediate family themselves (census and death records) that she was born in Missouri in 1844, more than a year after Daniel left Missouri.\\"America Waldo Bogle and the Question of her Ancestry By Brian W.

He was the subject of Jorge Preloran's Academy Award-nominated documentary Luther Metke at 94. Metke moved to Central Oregon in 1907 and built nearly every bridge between Bend and Crescent and over 30 log cabins.  Early life  Metke was born in Buffalo, New York, and was brought up on a homestead in Minnesota. He started building log cabins as a young boy, helping other homesteaders, and immigrant families build homes. He enrolled in the US Navy in 1898, at the age of 15, saw battle in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and served in the Philippines, Japan, and China. During an expedition up the Yangtze river, Metke saw the impact that deforestation and uncontrolled logging could have on the environment; this experience would strongly influence his poetry. He was married to Anna Dobbs, of Ireland and they had two sons and two daughters.  Midlife  Metke returned from service on the battleship Oregon and moved to central Oregon in 1907, at the age of 24. He purchased a homestead in Central Oregon, on the current site of the Sunriver Resort. He was a lumberjack, used the two-man saw to fall giant pines, some measuring six feet across, and floated them down the river for sale to mills in Bend, Oregon. Metke also built log cabins and bridges, a craft he remembered from his youth in Minnesota: he wrote that \\"a man never forgets how to use the old broad axe\\", the log-cabin building tool of choice for Metke. It is estimated that he built over 30 log homes in Central Oregon (including the grand lodge at Sunriver Resort) and built almost every bridge across the Deschutes River. In the 1920s, Metke became a labor organizer, an advocate of labor unions and better working conditions for workers in the logging industry. Metke's years spent homesteading, as a lumberjack and woodsman, shaped another of his personal facets and would strongly influence his poetry. In 1949, Metke was a key builder of the Camp Sherman Community Hall located in Camp Sherman, Oregon, and in February 2003 it was listed as a National Register of Historic Places due to its rustic architecture highlighting late 19th and early 20th- century American movements: Bungalow/Craftsman and Western Stick architecture. Metke later built three more log cabins in the Camp Sherman area.  Later life and poetry  In 1967, Metke settled in Camp Sherman, Oregon, on the Metolius River. By then he was known in Central Oregon as a rugged individualist, an environmentalist and a master builder of fine log cabins. No one suspected however, that Metke was also a poet, and for a good reason: he seldom shared his poetry, never attempted to publish it and shied away from his public image. In fact, he had little regard for poets‚Äî\\"Poems I write have a meaning; they're not about babbling brooks and such\\"‚Äîor for newspaper and television reporters, claiming \\"they want to make a hero out of somebody that has no business being one\\". Though it is unknown when Metke started writing poetry, he claimed he started in the 1970s as a means to communicate with his grandchildren. His poems touched on issues such as man's relationship with God, nature and aging. His poems are not regarded as exceptional by literary standards, but express with crushing clarity a way of life that was his and that has vanished: living in harmony with God and nature. Only 12 of his poems have ever been published‚Äîthese were presented in a documentary‚Äîhis other poems were destroyed late in his life. Luther Metke at 94 documentary Luther Metke at 94 was produced by Jorge Preloran and was an Oscar-nominated short documentary. It won six film festival awards including first place at the Atlanta Film Festival and the Silver Certificate at the Birmingham International Educational Film Festival. It was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. Luther Metke at 94 documents Metke building his last log cabin, in Camp Sherman (on Metke Lane) at the age of 94 and includes several of his poems.

Prior to the institution of this new decoration, a pair of distinctive Naval decorations had been instituted specifically to reward long and meritorious service by part-time officers of the Royal Naval Reserve, composed of Merchant Navy seamen, and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, composed of civilian volunteers.North East Medals - The Volunteer Officers' Decoration (Accessed 28 June 2015) Institution The Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, often colloquially and even officially referred to as either the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Officers' Decoration or the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Decoration, was instituted before 17 August 1908 as a long service award for part-time officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, Colonies and India. It was one of a pair of decorations which were instituted simultaneously, the other being the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve, often referred to as either the Royal Naval Reserve Officers' Decoration or the Royal Naval Reserve Decoration. The badges of these two decorations are identical and both initially hung from the same all-green ribbon, until a new ribbon was introduced for the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1919. (Accessed 26 May 2015) The decoration was also awarded by several countries in the British Empire. * South Africa adopted it in 1915, two years after the South African Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve was established on 1 July 1913.South African Medal Website - Union Defence Forces (1913-39) (Accessed 26 July 2015) * New Zealand adopted it in 1925 when the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (New Zealand) was established. * Canada adopted it as the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve Officers' Decoration in 1938, when the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve was stablished.Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal & Decoration (Accessed 27 July 2015)Veterans Affairs Canada - Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve Officers' Decoration (VRD) (Accessed 27 July 2015) Until c. 1947, recipients were entitled to use the post-nominal letters VD, the same as those for the Volunteer Officers' Decoration and the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration, approved by Royal Warrants dated 9 May 1925. The post-nominal letters were changed to VRD c. 1947.GlobalSecurity - Post Nominal Designations (Accessed on 27 July 2015)The Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Decoration 1908 (VRD) (Accessed on 27 July 2015)Honours & Decorations - Appendix to the Navy List - June 1957 - Royal Naval and Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserves Decoration (Accessed on 25 July 2015) The decoration was first awarded to Lieutenant Charles Alfred Jones on 9 November 1909. Award criteria The decoration could be awarded to part-time Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officers after twenty years of commissioned service, not necessarily continuous, as an efficient and thoroughly capable officer. Wartime service counted as double time, while half of the time served as a rating or in the ranks could be reckoned as qualifying service for the decoration. In any event, a minimum of seven years had to have been served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in any capacity before becoming eligible for the award of the decoration. An Officer who had previously been awarded the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal for service as a rating, could subsequently be awarded the decoration and still wear the medal, provided both periods of qualifying service had been completed. Officers serving on the active list on or after 1 June 1954, became eligible for the award of a clasp to the decoration after completing ten years of additional reckonable service, provided that no service could under any circumstances count double for the assessment of the additional ten years. Description The decoration is an oval skeletal design and was struck in silver, with parts of the obverse in silver-gilt. The badge is high to the top of the crown and wide. It has a diameter ring suspender, formed of silver wire, which is attached to a small ring affixed to the top back of the decoration.Birkenhead Returned Services Association - Military Medals - The Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve Decoration (Accessed 27 July 2015) First and second King George V versions King George VI version Queen Elizabeth II version ;Obverse The obverse has the royal cypher of the reigning monarch in silver-gilt, surrounded by a silver rope tied with a reef knot at the base and surmounted by a silver-gilt crown, which acts as the ribbon suspension.

In undress uniform, a recipient of a clasp would wear a silver rosette on the ribbon bar. ;Ribbons Two ribbons were used with the decoration. * The original ribbon was 38 millimetres wide and dark green. It is identical to the ribbon of the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. * A new ribbon was introduced c. 1919, 38 millimetres wide, with a 12 millimetres wide Navy blue band and a 4 millimetres wide dark red band, repeated in reverse order and separated by a 6 millimetres wide dark green band. The ribbon colours are symbolic, with the blue representing the sea, the red the Royal crimson and the green the original Volunteer Officers' Decoration ribbon colour. Order of wear In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve takes precedence after the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve and before the Royal Naval Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. =South Africa= On 6 April 1952 the Union of South Africa instituted its own range of military decorations and medals. These new awards were worn before all earlier British decorations and medals awarded to South Africans, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, which still took precedence before all other awards.

Event Kalinago leader Tegremond became uneasy with the increasing number of English and French settlers occupying St. Kitts. This led to more confrontations, which compelled him to plot the settlers' elimination with other indigenous peoples. His scheme was betrayed by a woman called Barbe to Thomas Warner and Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc. Taking action, the English and French settlers invited the Kalinago to a party where they became intoxicated. When the Kalinago returned to their village, 120 were killed in their sleep, including Tegremond. The following day, thousands more Kalinago were forced into the area of Bloody Point and Bloody River, where historian Vincent K. Hubbard estimates 2000 were massacred after they attempted to surrender. An early account of the slaughter by Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre describes \\"piles of bodies\\". 100 settlers were also killed. One Frenchman went mad after being struck by a manchineel-poisoned arrow.

Equally enthralling is Sharafyan's arrangement of Komitas's Krunk (Crane) for duduk, piano and cello. As in the Suite, tonally conventional elements co-exist with the oscillating pitches and clusters of Sharafyan's harmonic language to magical effect. Chicago Tribune (12,18,02) wrote about The Silk Road Ensemble at Chicago Orchestra Hall: \\"...But the most wonderful piece on the program was \\"The Sun, the Wine, and the Wind of Time\\" (1998) by the Armenian composer Vache Sharafyan. The score derived much of its ineffable sadness from the duduk, an oboe-like instrument whose quivery, throaty sounds were framed by piano (Joel Fan), violin (Colin Jacobsen) and cello (Ma). The seamless evolution of moods and textures‚Äîfrom soft, somber lines made up of pained intervals, to more violent outbursts, back to mournful lines‚Äîmade it entirely absorbing to the ear and mind...\\" The New York Times / May 9, 2002, Thursday MUSIC REVIEW:\\" At a Cultural Crossroads, Yo-Yo Ma Becomes a Spice Trader; By ALLAN KOZINN ...\\"And the Shostakovich, on Tuesday, seemed to flow naturally from the world of the work performed just before it  The Sun, the Wine and the Wind of Time by Vache Sharafyan, from Armenia  although it quickly established itself on Shostakovich's own terms\\"... Pittsburgh Post Gazette (8 May 2002) wrote: ...The evening's gem, though, was the Sharafyan. Without overtly referencing Vivaldi, this \\"Four Seasons\\" uses the calendar year as a metaphor for a circle of life... Pittsburgh Live By Mark Kanny / TRIBUNE-REVIEW CLASSICAL MUSIC CRITIC / Monday, August 5, 2002 Vache Sharafyan's \\"The Four Seasons\\" was the significant world premiere, including Armenian poetry as a prelude to each of the four movements... Sharafyan's language includes remarkable solo writing ... The composer is not afraid of dissonance, and the furious intensity he achieves serves clear narrative intent, including real satisfaction. David Harrington (Kronos Quartet) wrote: ‚ÄúI find him (Sharafyan) to be a fascinating and expressive composer whose music unites the ancient with the new and mysterious inner worlds with boldly tangible elements...‚Äù SAN FRANCISCO CLASSICAL VOCE / April 30, 2002, Robert Commanday, Senior Editor The issue with a cross-cultural composition is one of criteria. By what standard and in what aesthetic is the work to be perceived? It must be the product of a real and gifted composer, strong enough a composition to establish its own measure, as Takemitsu's pieces are. To an extent, Vache Sharafyan's The Sun, the Wine, and the Wind of Time (from Armenia, 1998) created its own time and space. The western tradition was reflected in its overall song-form structure and writing for piano, violin and cello. THE BOSTON GLOBE, by Matthew Guerrieri Globe Correspondent / May 27, 2008. By contrast, Vache Sharafyan's \\"Sinfonia No. 2 un poco concertante,\\" a BMOP commission and world premiere, takes that essence as its starting point. Melodies erupt into dense, slow-shifting harmonic clouds; a repetitive figure builds into crashing waves of multitudinous, Ivesian dissonance. A solo duduk, the Armenian folk oboe (pre-recorded for this concert), spins periodic arabesques, the instrument's microtonal inflections transmuted in the orchestra. Sharafyan creates complex, deliberate, ultimately captivating grandeur - artistic director Gil Rose led a terrific, vivid performance. External links *Personal homepage *G.

Wheatear was named after the wheatear, a small northern bird related to the stonechat and whinchat. Wheatear was laid down on 29 May 1944 at Cleveland, Ohio, by the American Ship Building Company; launched on 21 April 1945; sponsored by Mrs. H. P. Isham; and commissioned on 3 October 1945, Lt. Comdr. George M. Estep, USNR, in command. East Coast operations  Wheatear departed Cleveland, Ohio on 8 October and arrived in Boston on the 20th. There, she completed the fitting-out process and its attendant exercises. On 23 November, she got underway and headed south, arriving at Little Creek, Virginia, on the 27th. She began shakedown training which lasted until 14 January 1946 when she became an active unit of Mine Division (MinDiv) 10. Following post-shakedown availability, Wheatear began training operations in the Chesapeake Bay from her base in Norfolk, Virginia. That employment continued until 24 June when she received orders to proceed to Charleston, South Carolina, where she went into an inactive status due to a severe shortage of crew members. She continued in that status until 31 October. Return to East Coast operations  On 1 November, she returned to sea for a training cruise to the Panama Canal, during which voyage she also visited Orange, Texas, and Miami, Florida. For almost two years, the minesweeper operated out of Charleston as a unit of the Atlantic Fleet Mine Force. In August 1948, she was reassigned to the Operational Development Force, based at Panama City, Florida. For almost five years, she supported the force's developmental work. Based at Panama City, she cruised the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and in the West Indies, operating frequently in the Guantanamo Bay operating area and infrequently making cruises along the Atlantic seaboard as far north as Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. On 15 April 1953, Wheatear rejoined the active Mine Force at Charleston as a unit of MinDiv 81; however, less than a month later on 1 May, she transferred to MinDiv 85. For the remainder of her brief career, the warship operated along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies carrying out training missions with the Atlantic Fleet. The only exception to that routine came on 19 September 1953 when she departed Charleston on her only deployment. Mediterranean operations  She served with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean until January 1954 when she headed home. The minesweeper arrived at Charleston on 5 February 1954 and resumed her duties with the Mine Force. Decommissioning  In June, she began preparations for inactivation. On 17 November 1954, Wheatear was decommissioned at Orange, Texas, and berthed with the Orange Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On 7 February 1955, she was redesignated MSF-390. The warship remained in reserve at Orange until 1 July 1972 at which time her name was struck from the Navy list. On 20 December 1973, she was sold to the Southern Scrap Material Co., Ltd., of New Orleans, Louisiana, for scrapping.

The District contains a sub-district named the West Ninth Street/Baltimore Avenue Historic District listed on the National Register and which includes several buildings individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It also contains other notable structures not listed on the National Register. History of the Library District The Kansas City Club on Baltimore Avenue Originally developed as a commercial and entertainment area in the 1880s, the Library District took its new name in 2003 in connection with the move of the Kansas City Public Library's Central Branch to the former headquarters of the First National Bank of Kansas City, presently the Central Library. At the same time, many commercial office buildings nearby were converted to loft apartment residences and the City of Kansas City initiated major streetscape improvements within the district. Together, these changes established a distinctive character for the neighborhood. Distinctive features The Library District has a walking tour guide available through the Kansas City Public Library's website. The walking tour guide begins at the steps of the Library's public garage on 10th Street, between Wyandotte Street and Baltimore Avenue. =Library district buildings on the National Register of Historic Places= New York Life Building * Central Library (First National Bank Building, 1880) * Bunker Building (1881) * Old New England Building (1887‚Äì88) * New York Life Building (1888) * Savoy Hotel and Grill (1888) * Graphic Arts Building (1917) * Land Bank Building (1923‚Äì24) = Other historic Library District buildings = * The Kansas City Club (The University Club of Kansas City, 1922) * The Kansas City School of Law (1926) = The Kansas City Library District Garage \\"Community Bookshelf\\" = Library District Garage and Kansas City Club The Central Library's parking garage has a distinctive facade on 10th Street, using images of 22 9-meter-high bookspines to create a \\"community bookshelf.\\" The garage was created by architect Brian M.

It is the house in which Gage grew up. Frances Dana Barker Gage (October 12, 1808November 10, 1884) was a leading American reformer, feminist and abolitionist. She worked closely with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, along with other leaders of the early women's rights movement in the United States.James, Edward T., Editor. Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume II. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press (1971). , p.2 She was among the first to champion voting rights for all citizens without regard to race or gender and was a particularly outspoken supporter of giving newly freed African American women the franchise during Reconstruction, along with African American men who had formerly been slaves.Dubois, Ellen Carol. Feminism & Suffrage: The Emergence of an Independent Women's Movement in America, 1848‚Äì1869. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press (1999). p. 68 Early life and education Frances Dana Barker was born near Marietta, Ohio on October 12, 1808, the daughter of farmers Elizabeth Dana (1771‚Äì1835) and Col. Joseph Barker (1765‚Äì1843); her family's house is still in existence and has been designated a historic site.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1389. Frances was the tenth of eleven children. In 1788 the Barkers left New Hampshire and crossed the Alleghenies with Rufus Putnam, and were among the first settlers in the United States Northwest Territory. On January 1, 1829 she married James L. Gage (1800‚Äì1863), an abolitionist lawyer from McConnelsville, Ohio. He was a Universalist and a friend of the evangelist Stephen R. Smith. Traveling Universalist preachers, like George Rogers and Nathaniel Stacy, often stayed in the Gage household. Career =Activism= Gage wrote that her woman suffrage work began when she was ten years old, in 1818. She helped her father make barrels and her work was so well executed that her father praised her work, but then lamented her \\"accident of gender.\\" Gage wrote that this was a turning point for her, the incident bringing up hatred to the limitations of sex and laying the foundation for her later activism. Though Gage was inspired at an early age, she did not begin her activist work until after 1848. In 1850, she held a convention in McConnelsville, Ohio, which seventy people attended. Those at the convention fought to have race and gender removed from requirements for state citizenship and voting rights in the Ohio Constitution. Their work was not successful. She was an activist in the temperance, anti- slavery, and woman's-rights movements, and in 1851 presided over a woman's-rights convention in Akron, Ohio, where her opening speech introducing Sojourner Truth attracted much attention. Twelve years later, in 1863, Gage recorded her recollection of Truth's speech, \\"Ain't I a Woman?.\\" Gage's version notably differs from 1851 accounts, lengthening the speech, adding the oft-repeated \\"ain't I a woman\\" refrain,Craig, Maxine Leeds. Ain't I A Beauty Queen: Black Women, Beauty, and the Politics of Race, Oxford University Press USA, 2002, p. 7. and rendering it in a minstrel-like imitation of the speech of Southern slaves ‚Äì speech patterns which Truth, having grown up in New York speaking Dutch, did not possess. Despite its dubious historicity and racist undertones, her version has become the standard text and account of that famous speech. In 1853 she moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where she was often threatened with violence due to her anti-slavery views. Six months after moving to St. Louis, she was elected chair of the National Woman's Rights Convention in Cleveland in October. In 1857 she visited Cuba, Saint Thomas and Santo Domingo, and returned to write and lecture. Gage's radicalism had limited outlets in a slave state, such as Missouri. She and her family moved back to Columbus, Ohio in 1860. James' health was declining and the family had survived three mysterious fires, likely brought on by Frances' abolitionist views. In 1860, Gage became editor of the Ladies Department for the Ohio Cultivator where she advocated for feminists and abolitionists. She also lobbied for an Ohio law for married women to have the same property rights as men, but she was unsuccessful. When the American Civil War began she was employed by the Western Sanitary Commission; she traveled down the Mississippi River to help the injured in Vicksburg, Natchez and Memphis. From 1863 to 1864 she was the superintendent, under General Rufus Saxton, in charge of Parris Island, South Carolina, a refuge for over 500 freed slaves. While there she met and became friends with nurse Clara Barton, who was working nearby. They compared their childhoods, and discussed Universalism and literature. Gage joined the American Equal Rights Association in 1863 as a paid lobbyist and writer. Although in 1865 she was crippled when her carriage overturned in Galesburg, Illinois, she continued to lecture. Her addresses covered her \\"triune cause\\": first, abolition; second, women's rights; and third, temperance. The women's rights leaders and friends like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Amelia Bloomer, Lucy Stone and Antoinette Brown encouraged Gage to be the women's rights emissary in America's midwest. Her lecture circuit included Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. In 1867 she spoke at the First Anniversary of the American Equal Rights Association. > When we hold the ballot, we shall stand just there. Men will forget to tell > us that politics are degrading. They will bow low, and actually respect the > women to whom they now talk platitudes; and silly flatteries, sparkling > eyes, rosy cheeks, pearly teeth, ruby lips, the soft and delicate hands of > refinement and beauty, will not be the burden of their song; but the > strength, the power, the energy, the force, the intellect and the nerve, > which the womanhood of this country will bring to bear, and which will > infuse itself through all the ranks of society, must make all its men and > women wiser and better. =Publications= Gage wrote children's books and poems, under the pen name of \\"Aunt Fanny.\\" Her books include Fanny at School, Fanny's Birthday, and Fanny's Journey. She wrote for The Ohio Cultivator and other regional journals; she portrayed herself as a warm, domestic persona who offered advice and guidance to isolated housewives in Ohio. She wrote essays, letters, poetry, and novels. Among the other publications to which she contributed were the Western Literary Magazine, New York's Independent, Missouri Democrat, Cincinnati's The Ladies' Repository, Field Notes, and The National Anti- Slavery Standard. She was an early contributor to the Saturday Review, and published \\"Poems\\" (1867); \\"Elsie Magoon, or the Old Still-House in the Hollow: A Tale of the Past\\" (1872); \\"Steps Upward\\" (1873); and \\"Gertie's Sacrifice, or Glimpses of Two Lives\\" (1869). \\"A Hundred Years Hence\\" was a hymn composed by Gage and first sung in 1875. > Oppression and war will be heard of no more Nor the blood of a slave leave > his print on our shore, Conventions will then be a useless expense, For > we'll all go free suffrage, a hundred years hence. =Renouncing Universalism= She did not practice her religion all her life. > There came a time when Universalists refused to go with me as an > abolitionist, an advocate for the rights of women, for earnest temperance > pleaders,\\" she wrote late in life. \\"Then it came to me that Christ's death > as an atonement for sinners was not truth, but he had died for what he > believed to be truth.

Student body 24% of students belong to faiths other than Catholic. 74% percent of students are Caucasian, 14% are Hispanic, 6% are Asian, 3% are African Americans, 2% are Pacific Islanders, and 1% are American Indians. History Catholic education in Ogden began over 130 years ago. Its beginnings can be traced to Saint Joseph Parish, which planned and organized a school in the old Saint Joseph Church in 1877. Classes began at Easter of that year. In 1881, Saint Joseph School moved to a new building at the corner of 26th and Washington, which was built for the purpose of housing the school and its programs. In 1923, Bishop Glass dedicated the new Saint Joseph Grade School, built on the corner of 28th and Lincoln. 147 students were enrolled. Classes were held at this site until the fall of 1979. Saint Joseph Grade School then purchased the Quincy School from the Ogden Board of Education. The Quincy building on the corner of 30th and Quincy Avenue serves as the present location for preschool through eighth grade. In 1952, Saint Joseph Catholic High School was built in 1790 Lake street in Ogden and serves as the present location for ninth through twelve grade. Saint Joseph Catholic Schools (SJCS) serves nine parishes and missions in the greater Ogden area and is the only Catholic elementary school in Ogden.

She has written twelve books and numerous magazine articles on design and instruction including books on polymer clay, wire, beads, and children's art. Her books have been described as \\"among the most articulate and thoughtful books on polymer clay out there.\\" Her artwork incorporates a strong element of traditional design with innovative materials and artifacts.Barbara McGuire profile at Art Clay World McGuire has appeared as a regular guest of The Carol Duvall Show and has developed stamps, templates and molds for polymer clay. Background Growing up in Traverse City, Michigan, Barbara McGuire was always fascinated by art as a child, and after taking art classes, sold her first oil painting at age 13. Although she wanted to be a professional artist, she elected to follow her parents' advice and enter the restaurant business. She did, however, continue to create artwork as a hobby, and sell her work at local art shows. After moving to San Francisco in 1980, she began working with polymer clay because it required less bulky supplies than other mediums. She also decided to pursue a career in artwork and took a job with craft distributor Stanislaus Imports. On weekends, she continued to attend craft fairs where she sold her artwork. During a craft fair, McGuire came to the realization that there was a market for pre-made polymer clay canes and decided to go into product development. She approached American Art Clay Company (AMACO) with her idea. The company liked the idea and decided to manufacture the canes and to have her write a how-to book for the product, titled Friendly Clay Millefiori Cane. Shortly thereafter, she became the creative director of Accent Import-Export, the importers of Fimo clay. In 1999, she published Foundations in Polymer Clay Design, a book which helped distinguish her as one of creative leaders in her field. The book has been described as \\"a joy to look at\\"Foundations in Polymer Clay Design book review @ Bead Babe and \\"a must have for Polymer Clayers\\". In 2002, she released Creative Stamping in Polymer Clay which Polymer Clay Polyzine described as \\"a great reference chart for people ... who are adventurous with materials but don't ... really understand all the possibilities out there.\\" McGuire has continued to release books at regular intervals, and to date, she has written twelve books, with a thirteenth‚ÄîFaces In Clay‚Äîin progress. She has also written crafting articles for numerous magazines and other publications. In addition to writing, McGuire has been an innovator in her field. She is the inventor of the \\"Duo-Stamp\\", a two-sided rubber stamp with an inverse and converse design that is popular with the stamping community. Her \\"Bead Prints\\" have been described as \\"amazingly artistic products of great quality and usefulness\\". McGuire is currently affiliated with Polyform, who manufacture her new concept, \\"Shapelets\\", which are templates used for cropping and cutting shapes for jewelry embellishment and design. McGuire's profile within the field has led to her appearance on several American crafting shows, including The Carol Duvall Show where she is a regular contributor. Topics covered during her appearances include both polymer clay crafts and beading/jewelry making. McGuire describes her work as edgy with \\"an element of surprise and non-conformity\\" and says that her \\"ultimate goal is to give children and adults the permission and acknowledgment to be creative\\". She currently resides in Buford, GA, where she runs a classroom studio called Altered Art Source and a local art gallery where she sells her work. She has two children. Her eldest son, Robert, currently serves in the US Army.

The trail is a loop, and begins at the headwaters of the North River, and traverses up to several ridge tops. Due to the trail's difficulty (circumnavigating the trail requires 7,850 feet of total ascent) and length, it sees little traffic. History The Wild Oak Trail was designated a National Recreation Trail by the Secretary of Agriculture in 1979. Much of the land surrounding the trail and the North River was cleared for farming, which continued through the 1930s. It was during this time that portions of the trail was cleared by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help in providing access for fighting Forest Fires. Camp Todd, which the trail passes by after a crossing of the North River, was used as a herdsman's cabin and a Fire Guard station. Animals and Plants There are a variety of birds, reptiles and mammals in the area. Deer, rattlesnakes, fox, grouse and bobcats may be encountered by users of the trail. There have been more than forty species of trees and thirty wildflowers identified along the Wild Oak Trail. Activities The trail sees a variety of user activity, including hiking and backpacking. To complete the entire loop, various guides suggest devoting a day to each of the trail's three sections. The trail is well marked and easy to follow. Challenges for the hiker include steep ascents and descents, and few water supply points. There are backcountry camp spots along the trail. Hikers should be aware that the area is popular with hunters in the fall and should exercise necessary caution. Also, the trail and overlooks tend to be overgrown with vegetation late in summer, so an early Spring or early Fall hike is recommended. Mountain Biking is also a popular activity on the Wild Oak Trail. Part of the Shenandoah 100 Ultra-Endurance race uses the trail. The Virginia Happy Trails Running Club hold a couple \\"unofficial\\" trail running events a year on the Wild Oak. Participants may run the loop multiple times. Horseback Riders also utilize the trail, while using Camp Todd to stay overnight. In addition, the primitive North River Campground is located two miles (3 km) from the trail.

He went on to hold various commands up to and throughout the Second World War, and served as the first Commander of the Royal Ceylon Air Force from 1951 until 1958. Early life and WWI flying career Bladon was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, the son of John James Clarke Bladon (1876‚Äì1942) and his wife Annie Elizabeth (n√©e Daniels) (1880‚Äì1921). Bladon joined the Royal Naval Air Service in late 1917, soon after his 18th birthday, as a temporary probationary flight officer, and began his training at RNAS Cranwell. He was appointed a temporary flight sub-lieutenant on 29 January 1918, and was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 6700 on 3 March 1918. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service and the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) merged to form the Royal Air Force, and Bladon joined the new service with the rank of lieutenant. Inter-war career Bladon stayed with the RAF after the end of the war. He was transferred to the RAF's unemployed list on 22 November 1919, but on 12 December was awarded a short service commission with the rank of flying officer. In early 1920 Bladon was sent to Mesopotamia to serve in No. 30 Squadron, subsequently receiving mentions in despatches from Lieutenant-General Sir Aylmer Haldane, the commander the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, in September 1920 and October 1921. On 24 March 1922 he was transferred to No. 47 Squadron based in Egypt, and on 26 September was transferred again to No. 208 Squadron when it was sent to Turkey during the Chanak Crisis. On 10 July 1923 Bladon was seriously injured when his Bristol F.2b, H1678, overturned on landing. On 1 November 1923 Bladon returned to England, and on 1 April 1924 was posted to No. 420 (Fleet Spotter) Flight of the Fleet Air Arm. On 1 July 1925 he was promoted to flight lieutenant, and on 1 January 1926 was granted a permanent commission. On 31 May 1926 he was transferred to No. 443 Flight, based at RAF Leuchars. On 26 January 1927 Bladon was appointed Officer-in-Charge of No. 421 (Fleet Spotter) Flight, serving in the Mediterranean. Later his previous unit No. 443 Flight was temporarily split into two, with No. 443A Flight remaining at Leuchars while No. 443B Flight was attached to the China Station. Bladon commanded No. 443B Flight, until the Flight was reunited, then returned to No. 421 Flight. From 31 August 1928 he served of the Staff at RAF Gosport. Bladon was posted to RAF Base at Singapore on 22 September 1933. On 1 October 1935 he was promoted to squadron leader. On 9 April 1937 Bladon was appointed Officer Commanding of No. 42 Squadron, flying Vickers Vildebeest Mk.IV torpedo bombers from RAF Donibristle, Fife, Scotland. He was promoted to wing commander on 1 November 1938, and on 29 December was posted to the Air Staff at the Deputy Directorate of Operations (Naval Co-operation). World War II Bladon served as a staff officer during the Second World War, being posted to the Directorate of War Training and Tactics on 3 January 1940, then to the Directorate of Operational Training in July. He was promoted to the temporary rank of group captain on 1 March 1941, and was posted to the headquarters of Flying Training Command on 15 April 1942. His rank of group captain was made substantive on 1 December 1944. Post-war and Ceylon In 1946 Bladon was appointed Commander of the RAF Base at Singapore, and later served as Staff Officer (Administration) at the Air Headquarters Malaya. On 1 September 1948 Bladon was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer of No. 62 (Southern Reserve) Group in Reserve Command. The Royal Ceylon Air Force was officially founded in 1949, but work on its creation did not begin until Bladon was appointed Air Adviser to the Government of Ceylon on 16 May 1950. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 New Year Honours. Bladon became the first Commander of the Royal Ceylon Air Force on 2 March 1951, setting up his headquarters initially at the Galle Face Hotel. In creating a military organisation from scratch, he relied on a core of seconded RAF officers and NCOs, and Ceylonese personnel who had served with the RAF during the war. In 1952 the RCyAF consisted of eight officers and 100 airmen, but by 1955 had its Headquarters and Maintenance Unit at Colombo, and flying units based at Katunayake and Diyatalawa operating Chipmunk, Balliol and Oxford aircraft, used both for training and also army co-operation operations and illicit immigration patrols. Later, it formed a composite squadron of Austers and helicopters for army co-operation and air/sea rescue, a transport squadron of Doves and Herons, and two fighter squadrons with jet aircraft. Bladon was promoted to the acting rank of air commodore on 1 October 1956. He relinquished command of the RCyAF on 8 October 1958. Bladon retired from the RAF, retaining the rank of air commodore, on 22 February 1959. On 13 June he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1959 Birthday Honours. Bladon died in the Forbes Fraser Hospital, Bath, Somerset, on 11 October 1967. Personal life Bladon married Muriel Clibbens (1908‚Äì1977) in Hampstead in 1937, and they had one son.

ADELA initially consisted of 30 local citizen's groups ranging from farmers' organizations and the fisherman's union, to religious groups, small business owners, and marine biologists. ADELA now comprises over 100 local citizens' organizations.ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration. The various groups came together to form ADELA after becoming aware of the negative environmental impact of seismic reflection explorations being conducted by Harken Costa Rica Holdings in November 1999.ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration; ADELA, Welcome to ADELA.  Mission  The primary goal of ADELA is to effectuate a complete national moratorium on oil exploration.IFAW, Latest Updates on ADELA!, 8 May 2002: A Victory for the Environment and People of Costa Rica. In carrying out its mission, ADLEA informs and educates both the Caribbean community and political actors about the environmental risks the oil industry poses for Costa Rica, as well as for the Caribbean generally. ADELA also works with members of local communities to promote sustainable development, and to develop more environmentally friendly energy practices and policies.ADELA, Welcome to ADELA. With little material resources, ADELA largely relied on the grassroots efforts of its own members until 2001.Sam Martin, \\"No Rigs Allowed: Costa Rica Gives the Boot to a Texas Oil Company with Ties to George W. Bush,\\" OnEarth, Fall 2002. ADLEA was largely successful in its efforts, and managed to stage protests, voice their opinions over the radio, and even bring lawsuits in the Costa Rican national court. After recognizing that their message was not reaching the United States, home of the oil companies seeking to drill off the Costa Rican shoreline, ADELA contacted the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in early 2001.Sam Martin, \\"No Rigs Allowed: Costa Rica Gives the Boot to a Texas Oil Company with Ties to George W. Bush,\\" OnEarth, Fall 2002; Mark Engler & Nadia Martinez, \\"True Gold of Our Future,\\" New Internationalist, Oct. 2003, at 26. ADELA's cause received international exposure when the NDRC included the Talamanca tropical forest region in southern Costa Rica, in its BioGems initiative. ADELA also began to receive financial support, research, and legal resources from the following groups: NRDC, Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide, Global Response, Caribbean Conservation Corporation, Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense, International Fund for Animal Welfare, World Conservation Union, Forest Conservation Action Alerts, Environmental News Network, Project Underground, and Radio International Feminista.  Talamanca and potential environmental damage  Much of the oil exploration to date has occurred in the region of Costa Rica known as Talamanca.ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration; Sam Martin, \\"No Rigs Allowed: Costa Rica Gives the Boot to a Texas Oil Company with Ties to George W. Bush,\\" OnEarth, Fall 2002. Talamanca is recognized as being one of the richest marine ecosystems on the planet,NDRC & Friends of the Earth, The Threat to the Environment from the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA): The Case of Harken Costa Rica Holdings and Offshore Oil; and its mountainous terrain and tropical vegetation are considered to be equally rich.ELAW, Stop Development on Costa Rica's Caribbean Coast. Due to its biological significance, Talamanca is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Talamanca is also home to three indigenous community reserves, the Cahuita National Park, and a UN-designated wetlands site at the Gandoca- Manzanillo Wildlife Refuge. In total, 88% of the Talamanca region has some level of environmental protection. Talamanca's marine resources include coral reefs, mangroves, rare manatees, over 100 species of fish, and sea turtle nesting beaches. In fact, Costa Rica's Caribbean coast is a migratory pathway for at least three endangered species of sea turtles, and sea turtles are recognized as being especially susceptible to oil pollution.Gary Strieker, \\"Texas Oil a Slippery Issue in Costa Rica Vote,\\" CNN.com. Protection of the sea turtles is a primary concern for conservationists, but it is likely that mangroves and wetlands, generally, would not be able to recover from an oil spill. Oil pollution would also significantly impact the coastal communities and local economic infrastructure, as it would likely result in hundreds of fishing jobs being lost and a decrease in eco-tourism. Eco-tourism remains Costa Rica's primary source of revenue from other countries.  Efforts to halt exploration and drilling by Harken Costa Rica Holdings  = Background = In 1994, the Costa Rican legislature passed a Hydrocarbons Law which divided the country into 27 blocks for oil and natural gas exploration, and it allowed firms of foreign countries to bid for oil concessions. In July 1998, Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguex (1998‚Äì2002) granted one concession of four exploration blocks to MKJ Xploration Inc. (MKJ), a small Louisiana-based company. Located in Talamanca, the four blocks were to be used for the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons. In November 1998, Harken Energy Corporation (Harkan) of Dallas, Texas, purchased 40% of the concession rights from MKJ, and the two companies combined to create Harken Costa Rica Holdings (HCRH). In March 1999, Costa Rica's National Technical Environmental Secretariat (SETENA) approved an environmental impact study (EIA) submitted by HCRH to conduct marine seismic reflection blasting. Between October and December 1999, HCRH began using seismic reflection blasting to map possible oil reserves. Such blasting was in derogation of a condition in the EIA that restricted blasting to the months of January and July, so as to minimize the impact on marine life. The blasting significantly disrupted the local Costa Rican fishing industry. ADELA formed in December 1999 to oppose the actions of HCRH. = Efforts of ADELA = In January 2000, ADELA was a party in a lawsuit seeking an injunction and annulment of the HCRH exploration concessions. In September of that year, the Costa Rican Constitutional Court ruled in ADELA's favor, and granted an annulment of the four-block HCRH concession. The Court's ruling was based on International Labor Organization Convention 169, \\"Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries,\\" to which Costa Rica is bound. The Court later modified the ruling in November 2000, however, and nullified only those blocks affecting indigenous territory. In September 2001, SETENA convened a public hearing in Lim√≥n to debate issues concerning oil development. HCHR bused in approximately 100 people who they paid to attend the hearing, yet they were outnumbered by ADELA members. More than 300 people are reported to have supported ADELA's campaign with banners and posters. In addition, marine biologists and environmental organizations who support ADELA gave presentations about various social, economic, and environmental adverse impacts that could result from oil exploration and drilling. On February 28, 2002, SETENA rejected HCRH's EIA as not being environmentally or socially viable, and SETENA listed 50 reasons for its decision.ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration; E-LAW Advocate, Protecting Costa Rica's Tropical Coastline. HCRH's appeal was rejected by Elizabeth Odio, then-Costa Rican Minister of the Environment. In 2005, the Costa Rican President notified HCHR that their contract had been terminated, due to HCHR's failure to obtain an approved EIA pursuant to Costa Rican environmental law.

George Greenhill was educated at Christ's Hospital School and from there he went up to St John's College, Cambridge in 1866. In 1876, Greenhill was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy (RMA) at Woolwich, London, UK. He held this chair until his retirement in 1908. His 1892 textbook on applications of elliptic functions is of acknowledged excellence. He was one of the world's leading experts on applications of elliptic integrals in electromagnetic theory. He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1904 at Heidelberg (where he also gave a section talk) and an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1908 at Rome, in 1920 at Strasbourg, and in 1924 at Toronto. In 1879, Greenhill developed a rule of thumb for calculating the optimal twist rate for lead-core bullets. This shortcut uses the bullet's length, needing no allowances for weight or nose shape.Mosdell, Matthew. The Greenhill Formula. (Accessed 2009 AUG 19) Greenhill applied this theory to account for the steadiness of flight conferred upon an elongated projectile by rifling. The eponymous Greenhill Formula, still used today, is: Cast bullets as cast (left), with gas check (center) and lubricated (right). \\\\mathrm{Twist} = \\\\frac{C D^2}{L} \\\\times \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{SG}{10.9}} where: *C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s) *D = bullet's diameter in inches *L = bullet's length in inches *SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation) The original value of C was 150, which yields a twist rate in inches per turn, when given the diameter D and the length L of the bullet in inches. This works to velocities of about 840 m/s (2800 ft/s); above those velocities, a C of 180 should be used. For instance, with a velocity of 600 m/s (2000 ft/s), a diameter of and a length of , the Greenhill formula would give a value of 25, which means 1 turn in . Textbooks * A. G.

The film stars Eita as a member of a university science-fiction club, and Juri Ueno and Yoko Maki as part of the neighboring photography club. Plot Summer Time Machine Blues is based around a group of friends in a science-fiction club who spend their days fooling around at the clubhouse. The boys play a game of baseball as their friend Yui Ito takes pictures of them nearby. After the game, the boys return to the clubhouse and head off to the bathhouse leaving the girls, Yui and Haruka to develop their pictures. While they bathe, Niimi gets angry because he thinks someone stole his Vidal Sassoon shampoo. On their way back, Komoto decides to sneak off to buy tickets at the theater for a sci-fi B movie. He hopes that he can ask Haruka out. Haruka says that she does not want to go out with him since he apparently has a girlfriend, but Komoto has no idea what she is talking about. But when he returns to the clubhouse, his friends act very strangely as to where he has been. They make him explain what happened, but through a series of chain events, Ishimatsu accidentally spills Coke all over the air-conditioner remote control after being hit in the face. Everyone rushes to try to clean the remote off, but it's too late. The remote is broken and they cannot turn on the air-conditioner. This immediately becomes a problem as the day becomes hotter. The remote apparently cannot be repaired as it is too old, so the boys give it to their club advisor to try to fix. They look for a fan in the meantime but only find broken ones. Back at the clubhouse, the boys discover a strange boy in the room who hurriedly escapes, leaving behind some sort of machine. They put Soga on the time machine thinking it is a practical joke on the sci-fi club, but to their surprise it actually works. Soga appears in a picture of their baseball game that they held yesterday. They fool around discovering that it is a time machine. The boys decide to travel to the past to steal the remote control before it was broken and bring it back to the present. But as soon as they step back one day, they run into problems beyond their control. While Ishimatsu, Niimi and Koizumi go back in time to retrieve the remote. The strange guy is revealed to be Tamura who is a member of the sci-fi 25 years in the future. Tamura gets sent to the past the same way Soga was coerced onto the machine. The remaining members, Haruka, Soga, Ito, and Komoto take Tamura on a tour of the past. While on the tour they encounter their club adviser, Professor Kohtaro Hozumi, referred to as Hose, who explains that changing the past results in the grandfather paradox and would cause the universe to vanish. Realizing this the remaining club members rush back to ensure that the Ishimatsu, Niimi, and Koizumi do not change the past. Ishimatsu and Koizumi get sent back to the present but they return shortly with Tamura after being informed about the situation. They find the time machine waiting for them when they get back to the club room. Soga and Takuma go to the past and prevent the trio from changing the past. In the process Soga wraps the remote in tape and gets transported to 99 years into the past to prevent the caretaker from discovering the time machine. The school being originally a swamp, Soga almost drowns before returning to the present. The past villagers mistaken him as a Kappa and Kappas becomes integral to the town culture. Soga also loses the remote 99 years in the past. Komoto finds Niimi at the bathhouse and in a twist it is revealed that Niimi himself took the shampoo. With the remote missing Tamura goes into his future to retrieve the future's remote so that the past won't be altered. Everyone gets on the time machine but the machine is too small and Komoto gets knocked off. Komoto deceives the past club members who mistakenly believe that he has a girlfriend due to a voice message Komoto sent to the \\"present Soga\\" which \\"past Soga\\" received. Komoto distracts the club members but before he can leave his past self enters the club room. With no other options Komoto hides in the club room locker. The present club members return and notice that Komoto is not with them, but Komoto is already in the present having spent the whole day in the locker. A dog digs up a remote which is revealed to have survived for 99 years in mud and the remote still works. Tamura returns to his present but forgets his camera. When he returns for it he says that it belonged to his mother and Komoto and Ito note that Haruka also possess a similar camera. When they met, Tamura notes that his mother also attended this college. Komoto and Ito deduce that Tamura is the son of future Haruka. Professor Kohtaro Hozumi is inspired by these events to build a time machine which might explain the time machine's origins since Tamura and his club members also did not know the machine's origins. Since Takuma's girlfriend was revealed a lie, Haruka agrees to go on a date with Komoto. Komoto wonders how he can change his name (presumably to Tamura).

Early life and family Argentina Mercedes Gonz√°lez Morel was born to Pablo Gonz√°lez Valerio and Juanita Morel, in Mao, Dominican Republic. In 1929, her family emigrated to the United States, and settled down in Manhattan, New York City. Musical influence Boyar became a United States citizen after residing in the country from the age of eight. She was a dedicated student of the folk music of all countries. She was called the satin Latin song stylist. and sometimes the Ruban Blue-Bird. Walter Winchell said that she was the finest Latin talent in the entertainment field in 1960. During the 1939 New York World's Fair she made a concerted effort to persuade Americans to adopt the Dominican Republic's native dance, the merengue. An initial reluctance eventually subsided, and by 1955 it was the fastest growing dance in the U.S. When Boyar introduced calypso songs to America, many felt the music was not commercial. By 1954 calypso songs were among the bestsellers. She introduced a new song, That's Why A Woman Loves A Heel, in October 1945. By 1948 Boyar had appeared on every overseas radio network. Boyar entertained at Ciro's in Mexico City and the Hotel Nacional in Havana. Among her numerous nightclub engagements was a December 1955 performance at the Viennese Lantern, at 242 East 79th Street in Yorkville, Manhattan. A lawsuit was taken out by an angry tenant who resided above the club. He contended that Boyar's bongo drummer kept him awake. Clothing designer Boyar was a fashion designer for stage and motion picture stars. Her designs were very original yet simple. She also created expensive handbags. She had over two hundred gowns to wear to performances in her New York City apartment. Other She appeared in the three-minute short Princess Papaya (1945). Boyar played a singer in an episode of the television show Mister Peepers, in 1952. In 1961 she received a Universal Pictures screen test. Her first husband was Federico Horacio \\"Gugu\\" V√°squez Henr√≠quez. She was widowed when her husband was captured and executed after landing at Luper√≥n, Puerto Plata in 1949 as part of a plot against Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo. Her second husband was actor Leslie Nielsen, from 1950 to 1956. They separated in August 1955, with Nielsen obtaining a default divorce in June 1956. He agreed to pay $19,000 ($ today) in lieu of alimony, by monthly instalments of $500. She married comedian Lee Tully in March 1958 and divorced him in Mexico three months later. Boyar was friends with Marlon Brando, who visited her when she was hospitalized at New York‚Äôs Lenox Hill Hospital, in January 1955.

It originates from the floodplain of the Sele river, in the province of Salerno in southern Italy. It was formerly used as a military horse, but in the twentieth century became principally a sport horse.  History  The Salernitano originates in the floodplains of the Sele river in the comuni of Battipaglia, Capaccio and Eboli, in the province of Salerno in Campania in southern Italy. From the time of the Republic of Amalfi and during the crusades, the local horses of the area were influenced by Oriental blood. Under the Bourbons there were influences from Spanish horses and again from the Orient. From the early years of the nineteenth century, Thoroughbred and ‚Äì to a lesser extent ‚Äì Hackney blood was used to improve military aptitudes. From the 1920s the Salernitano began to be used as a sport horse, in flat racing, over jumps and in show-jumping. After the Second World War there was little demand for cavalry horses, and the breed was used mostly for sports. The Campania regional administration started a conservation programme for the breed in the 1970s. In 1990 the total number was estimated at 100. In 2007 the FAO recorded the conservation status of the breed as \\"endangered\\". The Salernitano was formerly registered together with the Persano, which originates from much the same area and shares some of the same history. In 2015, the two breeds were recognised as separate by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture.  Characteristics  The usual coat colour is bay; chestnut, grey and black are also accepted.  Use  The Salernitano is suitable for use as a riding horse, as a harness horse, for equestrian touring and horse- trekking, and for sports, particularly show-jumping.

History The two sites of the academy were previously two of five schools which were closed to be combined into the then named Hertswood School. =Beginnings= Hertswood School was established to replace Borehamwood's old three-tier system of lower, middle and upper schools with a two-tier system. As such, Lyndhurst, Furzehill and Holmshill middle schools were closed, along with Hawksmoor and Hillside upper schools. The new, larger school was established on the sites of Nicholas Hawksmoor School (previously Borehamwood Grammar School) and Holmshill Secondary Modern, the two schools having been approximately 400 metres apart. The reorganisation was paid for through the sale of the three other sites for housing development. The school opened in September 2000 under Headteacher Ian Lucas. =Arts college and theatre= Hertswood School gained specialist arts college status in 2005Specialist Arts College Status and in 2009 The Ark Theatre Borehamwood was established on its upper site.

An English oak chest with complex linenfold panels. Linenfold (or linen fold) is a simple style of relief carving used to decorate wood panelling with a design \\"imitating window tracery\\",Whiton, Augustus Sherrill. Interior Design and Decoration. Lippincott, 1974. . Page 72. \\"imitating folded linen\\"Fletcher, Banister. A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method. Scribner, 1961. Page 1266. or \\"stiffly imitating folded material\\".Wight, Jane A. Brick Building in England from the Middle Ages to 1550. J. Baker, 1972. Page 423. Originally from Flanders, the style became widespread across Northern Europe in the 14th to 16th centuries. The name was applied to the decorative style by antiquarian connoisseurs in the early 19th century; the contemporary name was apparently lignum undulatum (Latin: \\"wavy wood\\"), Nathaniel Lloyd pointed out.Nathaniel Lloyd, \\"Medieval Wainscoting and the Development of the Linen Panel\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 53 No. 308 (November 1928), pp 230-37. Wood panelling or wainscoting, almost always made from oak, became popular in Northern Europe from the 14th century, after European carpenters rediscovered the techniques to create frame and panel joinery. The framing technique was used from the 13th century onwards to clad interior walls,A directive of Henry III for \\"Norway boards\\" to \\"wainscot\\" the chamber of the prince Edward at Winchester was noted by Nathaniel Lloyd 1928:230. to form choir stalls, and to manufacture moveable and semi-moveable furniture, such as chests and presses, and even the back panels of joined chairs. Linenfold was developed as a simple technique to decorate the flat surfaces of the ubiquitous panels thus created. The simplest linenfold style is \\"parchemin\\" (also known as \\"parchment fold\\"), a low relief carving formed like a sheet of paper or piece of linen folded in half and then spread out with the sharp centered fold running vertically, and the top and bottom running out to the corners of the panel, with something of the appearance of an opened book. This style of linenfold can be created using a plane and a pre-drawn pattern, with a little finishing chisel work required at each end. A stitched embroidered border could be counterfeited by the use of punches. More complicated styles resemble a sheet of fabric that has volute folds back and forth many times. Linenfold might be fielded, visually complete against a flat panel surface and contained within each panel, or it might provide the appearance of a continuous linenfold passing behind the stiles of the framing. Carving linenfold decoration requires basic carving skill, the creased designs were run with a round plane; only top and bottom edges needed to be finished with a gouge. Significantly, linenfold had no prototype in architectural practice:John Gloag, A Short Dictionary of Furniture, rev. ed. 1969: sub \\"Linenfold\\" the technique of the round scraper plane is also applicable to softer stone-cutting. Regional variations quickly developed in England, France and Germany. The linenfold of France, Netherlands, and Germany \\"is carved with a sharper definition and greater delicacy than was usual in England\\",Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 15th ed. Article \\"Decorative Arts and Furnishings\\", section \\"Middle Ages\\" (by Joseph T. Butler, online). where an early linenfold panelling can be seen in the hall screen at Compton Wynyates. Linenfold started to fall out of fashion as Renaissance styles spread in the 16th century, replaced by fielded panels for simpler work, and more complicated \\"Roman\\" and higher relief carving, but linenfold continued to be used in less sophisticated surroundings well into the 17th century. In the 19th century, linenfold panelling reappeared in the revivals of the Gothic and Tudor styles.

Presently, the home operates as the Gruene Mansion Inn and Bed and Breakfast in the Gruene Community of New Braunfels, Texas. One of several homes owned by the Gruene Family, the house was built of timber framed (fachwerk) and adobe by Henry Gruene, second son of Ernst and Antoinette Gruene, the original settlers. Henry purchased the farm, with house and outbuildings, from his brother Ernst, Jr., about 1876, when he returned from the longest trail ride in American history, having gone all the way to Canada. The oldest house in Gruene is across the street and Henry lived here for a time, along with his brother Ernst Jr., until he married and built the mansion. The entire town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 due to the efforts of Cheryle Fuller, who did all of the historical research, including several hours of taped interviews with Henry Gruene, Jr., which she transcribed and submitted along with the historical survey. Cheryle also wrote the deed restrictions, which at the time were the only deed restrictions protecting an historic district in Texas. Henry Gruene, Jr. built the red brick house next door to this one, where he lived until selling the town buildings and remaining family acreage to developers Rathgeber, West, Leach in 1974. Ernst, Jr. (b. 1855) lived in a now destroyed duplex across from his parents' retirement home, which was the original farm house mentioned in the deed of 1872, and next to his nephew Henry Jr.'s red brick home.

The ThinCan remained relatively unknown outside Estonia until 2006, when a recent ThinCan iteration was selected as the hardware base for the Linutop, a network appliance that greatly stimulated the market for lightweight computing platforms. The ThinCan was also commercialized by SmartLink under the Revnetek brand name. Hardware Functionally, all ThinCan production models offer similar features: * Front panel: 1/8\\" stereo audio, USB ports. * Back panel: Ethernet port, VGA output, PSU connector. Aesthetically, the original ThinCan was an exercise in futuristic looks, with brushed aluminum end caps and a tubular aluminum shape that featured alternating patterns of decorative serrations along the surface of the tube. The tube came painted in one's choice of several transparent colors (black, dark blue, light blue, purple, red) for an authentic \\"Jetsons\\" feel. After an early prototype based on a custom x86 core, supporting PS/2 keyboard and mouse, the platform was redesigned around an NSC Geode SC2200 supporting only USB peripherals. An optional on-board SmartCard reader attached to an internally mounted USB port made the original ThinCan an instant hit on the local market, due to an Estonian legislation dating from 2001 that mandated the issuance of a national Electronic ID card to all citizens and their use to access many public services. Still, while the futuristic design received some attention in the IT press, the prohibitive cost of machining an extruded aluminum tube with intricate decorative serrations prevented the manufacturer from achieving commercial success with this early model. In 2003, the company revised the design towards a simpler cost-effective flat boxy shape for their DBE60 model (initially commercialized as the ThinCan SE). Aside from the addition of a parallel printer port, the DBE60 is functionally identical to the original ThinCan and built around the same NSC Geode SC2200. In 2005, this design was updated for the AMD Geode LX700-based DBE61 model, with USB 2.0 provided by a CS5536 companion chip. The parallel printer port was then removed, returning the design to an all-USB configuration. Linutop SARL retained this model as a starting point for their Linutop-1 product. In 2007, the DBE61 design was upgraded with Gigabit Ethernet support. The manufacturer calls this the DBE62. In 2009, the DBE62 design was reconfigured to use SO DIMM memory and IDE Compact Flash media. The manufacturer calls this the DBE63. Software =Firmware= SC2200-based models boot using a proprietary loader called Clara that was developed by Artec. All LX700-based models can natively boot using Coreboot. This started as a Geode GX port developed by AMD for the OLPC prototype, to which Artec added Geode LX support. That code was later adopted and further polished by AMD, after the OLPC switched to the LX700 for its production models. This Coreboot port was used on the SmartLink model and on several custom Artec models configured as network appliances. Meanwhile, both Artec's PXE-boot and Linutop's USB-boot DBE61 models, plus all DBE62 and DBE63 models, use a General Software BIOS. =Operating system= The original ThinCan ran on Windows CE and launched into an RDP client for Windows Terminal Services. DBE60 models come with either the same RDP client as the original ThinCan or with Etherboot support for UNIX terminal services. DBE61 models come with either a BIOS with PXE support optimized for LTSP or with a BIOS for USB booting Linutop's own Linux distribution. Meanwhile, SmartLink preloads their DBE61 models with their own versatile firmware called R-BOX that can be user- configured to launch into either an RDP client or into a Web kiosk - both of which are implemented using Free Software components - and which makes use of the Coreboot port. DBE62 models have a BIOS that first attempts booting from USB and, if no bootable USB media is found, then attempts PXE booting - essentially combining the boot options of Artec's and Linutop's models into a single configuration. DBE63 models run on Embedded Windows XP and launch into a Web kiosk.

With his designs Henselmann observed the historical function of the square as an area of cattle trade and as an area for the cattle there to drink, which existed until into the 19th century. Out of Gneiss he created a terraced fountain scene on the lightly sloping site. The irregularly formed basin of the fountain in the centre of the work imitates the idea of a naturally formed puddle or pool. The fountain is crowned by a powerful set of bronzeworks above the steps. It shows three cattle which look down from their position onto people resting at the base of the fountain.

Synopsis The story itself takes place in 1992. The plot follows two parallel patterns, one during late apartheid South Africa where incumbent president F.W. de Klerk, leader of the Afrikaner minority which is on the brink of losing power to the African majority under the leadership of the ANC, about to end 44 years of suppression by the Broederbond rule. Simultaneously, Detective Chief Inspector Kurt Wallander is investigating a case of a missing female Methodist real-estate agent outside Ystad. Upon the eventual recovery of her body, as well as the discovery of a severed black finger at the crime scene, Detective Chief Inspector Wallander realizes the case has deep roots in the history and current development in South Africa, where it appears that an extremist cell of the Broederbond is about to orchestrate the murder of F W de Klerk by an infamous black assassin, wishing to plunge the country into a long and devastating civil war. Publication Mankell, who himself was deeply interested in questions concerning South Africa and its history and who used to reside in the country part-time, released the book in 1993 during the reign of the National Party and the Afrikaner rule.

The phrase Tebtunis archive (uncapitalized) may also be used for the papyri from family archives found at Tebtunis. The Tebtunis papyri are written in either Demotic (Late Egyptian) or Koine Greek and were found during a single expedition led by Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur S. Hunt, two British papyrologists in the winter of 1899/1900 at the village of ancient Tebtunis (near modern Umm-el-Baragat), Egypt.Todd M. Hickey \\"The Tebtunis Papyri Collection.\\" The Center for the Tebtunis Papyri. University of California, Berkeley. Retrieved 2016-02-18. The papyri can be divided into three groups based on their provenance: texts from the crocodile mummies, the town and from the temple of Soknebtunis, and the cartonnage of human mummies. Provenance =Crocodile mummy texts= A large portion of the Tebtunis crocodile mummies come from the archive of the komogrammateus or village scribe, of the nearby village, Kerkeosiris, at the end of the 2nd century BC. The Menches papers make up the biggest part of the Crocodile Papyri. These papers are divided into two groups, administrative documents and correspondence. The administrative documents are long reports that detail the state of affairs of every square meter of the area surrounding Kerkeosiris. The correspondence section essentially includes official letters that were addressed to Menches by his superiors and peers in the Ptolemaic bureaucracy.Todd M. Hickey \\"Contents of Tebtunis Papyri.\\" University of California Berkeley. Retrieved 2016-02-18. There also exists a separate group of texts made up of forty-five private documents from the first half of the 1st century BC. These texts were found in five crocodile mummies that had been buried next to each other. =Soknebtunis texts= Grenfell and Hunt's first excavation in 1899 at the Temple of Tebtunis found 200 papyri. The papyri from the town are the most diverse, and they have provided us with literary fragments, including contracts, petitions, declarations, and tax receipts. Most of these papyri concern the priests of the crocodile god, Soknebtunis (Sobek of Tebtunis David Frankfurter, Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance, Princeton University Press, 1998, p.159), the central deity worshiped in the temples. These documents reveal what life was like for Tebtunis priests when Egypt was under Roman rule. =Cartonnage of human mummy texts= Grenfell and Hunt's second excavation, at the southwest necropolis, unearthed fifty mummy coffins where used papyri had been recycled in the manufacture. The papyri from the cartonnage covering human mummies date from the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. Most of these documents can be traced back to Oxyrhynchus (modern-day El-Bahnasa), a small village to the north of Tebtunis. These texts are from village officials, the village scribe, and the guards. =Two new documents from the Tebtunis archive= Two papyri have been found that provide evidence regarding two officials, Apion and Kronion, who were in charge of the village record office in Tebtunis during the first half of the 1st century AD. This provides us with more information about certain events in the village of Tebtunis. These documents have been published in two volumes of Papyri from Tebtunis. The village record was directed by Apion from 7 AD to at least 25 AD and by 43 AD it was under the direction of Kronion, son of Apion, until 52 AD.Elinor M.

Synopsis Two young women and one young man, inexplicably dressed as the nobility of Sweden did during the reign of Gustavus III, are found dead, each slain with a single bullet, their bodies half consumed by animals in the wilderness. Wallander is horrified when he makes a connection between the crime and his close friend and colleague Svedberg, and after the latter is found savagely murdered in his own apartment, the tormented detective finds himself up against a deranged, merciless killer who remains just one step ahead of him.  Adaptation  In 2005, One Step Behind was adapted by Swedish public broadcaster Sveriges Television into a theatrical film, starring Rolf Lassg√•rd as Wallander.

The first was published in 1994; in 1995; and in 2001. All three were developed by Holistic Design (HDI) but had separate publishers. The first two use MS-DOS; the third Windows. All three support up to four players and differ chiefly in their graphics and user interface. In general, the games are trade simulators where items are bought low, transported, and sold high. They achieved notability, however, for their representation of Venetian and papal politics, with players able to bribe senators and cardinals for political, military, and religious power. Overt attacks against other players can destroy one's popularity and influence, but the game offers a thieves' den where covert options include arson, rumor- mongering, and assassination. The games are won after a predetermined number of turns (years) by the player with the highest net worth, including the value of bribed senators and cardinals. The game's world map has been praised as \\"capturing what exploring is really like\\", as the player expands beyond the known and certain world into distant seas and lands which have been filled in only by rumor, legend, and wild speculation. Story The games begin with a letter from the player's wealthy uncle Niccolo announcing that he has died and left the majority of his estate to his daughters. He has left the player a yearly stipend of 100 florins (i.e., ducats), a map of the known world, at least one trading vessel, and some advice reminiscent of Machiavelli: \\"you must stick to the good so long as you can but if compelled by necessity you must be ready to use other means\\" and the \\"Golden Rule\\" that \\"he who has the gold makes the rules\\". The player's goal‚Äîover one lifetime or several‚Äîis to improve his family's standing..  Gameplay  Players choose a family crest and surname rather than an individual name. Play begins in 1300 and can last (in the first two titles) as late as 1492, the year of Columbus's rediscovery of the Americas. The default map covers all of Afro-Eurasia and permits the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope but not the North Cape. This can be replaced by randomized maps with variable amounts of ocean, forest, desert, &c.; The game is won by the first player to acquire a million florins or by the player with the highest net worth at game's end. Canaletto's Entrance to the Grand Canal (), a variant of which serves as the Venetian screen in Merchant . =Venice= The player competes with three other families‚Äîeither other humans or AIs of variable difficulty‚Äîto be the most successful clan in Venice. Opponents may be negotiated or allied with, aided, or threatened. The Council of Ten may all be bribed into service, allowing the player to be appointed as Venice's council head, general, admiral, or minister of construction. A family may only hold one office at a time, but any family with a senator must receive a post. Funds may be well-used or embezzled; those without access to the city's army may still hire large mercenary forces at the Campanile. The council head receives no funds but may try senators for treason. Support from a majority of the council at the decennial election allows one to hold the office of doge, controlling other appointments and Venice's taxation. Popularity can be improved by donations to the church, by throwing lavish masquerades, or by funding major works of sculpture, painting, and architecture. Defeating brigands and pirates in battle is also well received. The wealthiest families may purchase ecclesiastical benefices, providing income and influence in the college of cardinals. Enough influence at a conclave gives a player control over the papacy itself. Popes may embezzle church funds, \\"excommunicate\\" (i.e., place an interdict upon) Christian cities, and gather crusading armies. In some games, overindulgence in indulgences provokes an earlier Reformation, turning northern cities against Italy and its traders. Direct attacks against friendly cities or fellow Venetians, when proven, is highly unpopular and must be compensated through fines. For the devious, impatient, or wrathful, \\"den of iniquities\\" permits players to burn others' warehouses and homes, destroy reputations with rumormongering, or to assassinate senators, cardinals, doges, and popes. Being tied to the act can destroy one's reputation, but other players can be framed as well.. world map from Ptolemy's Geography, rediscovered by the Byzantine monk Maximus Planudes . Note the largely accurate treatment of the Mediterranean, while Scandinavia disappears, Scotland is placed at a right angle to England, Sri Lanka swells to a larger size than India, and the placement of the western shore of the World Ocean remains uncertain. =Exploration= The map the player receives from uncle Niccolo resembles those of the period: it is highly accurate close to Venice but grows much less so the further one goes. The mechanic has been praised by reviewers: \\"Though its gameplay was nowhere near as sophisticated as that of its near contemporary Civilization, Merchant Prince/Machiavelli did a better job of capturing what exploring is really like. Very rarely in the human experience are people pushing into an entirely blank unknown space. There are always rumors, always guesses, always some advice either from locals or past chronicles.\\". An accurate map of the world in a historical game of Machiavelli, along with a series of the maps bequeathed to players at game start by their deceased uncles. Note that, while Italy remains consistently accurate, distant features such as India and Japan shift, disappear, or become separate continents. Even nearby Anatolia sometimes mutates as well. The effect upon gameplay is pronounced when such maps are the only guide to exploration of randomly-generated worlds. The player must send out trade or military units to explore the world, facing pirates, brigands, and storms at sea and in the desert, or negotiate with the other families to purchase more accurate maps from them. Many cities are initially closed to foreign traders and their leaders must be bribed or forcibly removed to open them to trade. Defeating a city with Venice's armed forces or one's own mercenaries permits one to control it (closing it to rivals) or to negotiate its status as a freeport (left open to rivals but providing a large boost to popularity). The time and effort exploration takes is somewhat compensated by the occasional discovery of extremely valuable relics‚Äîsuch as a head of John the Baptist‚Äîthat are sold to the cathedral at Venice. =Trade= In addition to uncle Niccolo's stipend, the player can earn income from indulgences and government offices. Ultimately, the most profitable course is to begin trading various commodities among the world's major cities. Trade is possible via small or large galleys (fast and nimble but frail in storms), small or large cogs (slow and unable to use small rivers but resistant to storms at sea), donkey teams (resistant to rockslides), or camel caravans (resistant to sandstorms). Up to 15 units may be purchased and used together. The commodities include Venetian glass, French wine (as \\"grog\\"), relics from the Holy Land, African gold and ivory, Chinese silk, and Indonesian spices,. though not salt or slaves. The cities include major centers such as Venice and Khanbaliq (misspelled \\"Kahnbalig\\"),. along with oddities like Antioch and imaginary locales like Shangri-La (as \\"Xiangrala\\"). Depending on the difficulty level, brigandry and piracy may be rampant and each successful attack makes them stronger still. Guards may be hired to deal with them but can be quite expensive and, if unpaid, will turn to brigandage. Goods become extremely valuable in times of crisis: during interdicts from the pope (driving away pious traders), outbreaks of plague (which usually begin a decade or two into the game), and wartime. Trading under such conditions can be highly profitable but risky: plague may destroy one's trading units and they may be attacked by rival or renegade armies. All three games support automated trading routes, although the path selection and bugginess varies among the versions. doge and pope. The descent of Italy into plague and war permitted red to start catching up, while the expense of early feuding has kept yellow and green from growing at the same speed. =History= The games begin in the year 1300. The default is for them to end in 1400, but they may be set to end after 15, 30, 60, 150, or 192 years as well. The manual includes an overview and glossary of this period and incorporates aspects of the era both directly and through game mechanics. The Venetian‚ÄìGenoese Wars, corsairs, Black Plague, condottieri, and indulgences appear and the players' actions may instigate an early Reformation, recreate the ignoble Fourth Crusade, or mirror the struggles of the Medicis, travels of Marco Polo, or precepts of Machiavelli. On historical maps, the rounding of Africa and assaults on Turkey, Persia, and India may be achieved by the players or AI ahead of the Portuguese, but there is no effect on the prosperity of Venice. The Hundred Years' War, Turco-Venetian wars, and Tatar invasions appear in minor form. Game mechanics push players into adopting a coasting trade for galleys, large caravans and convoys for important routes, and working for the good of all Venetians in public while covertly bribing officials and sabotaging rivals. Numerous items, however, are simplified: the doges were appointed for life but the Ten served only one-year terms and could only have a single family member serving at a time. The Republic of Venice maintained its allegiance to Rome throughout the Western Schism but the earlier Avignon Papacy goes unmentioned. Cities only occasionally and randomly close themselves to trade. Florence is treated as a seaport in place of Pisa and Constantinople is given its earlier and terser name Byzantium. Merchant Prince II included a few cut scenes and five new scenarios in addition to Afro-Eurasia and the random map generator. They were the Hanse (the Hanseatic League in the North and Baltic seas), the Mediterranean (a Venetian family), the Orient (a Shanghainese trader in the Far East), Marco Polo (along the Silk Road), and a fantasy treatment of Atlantis (represented as a single island city in the Atlantic).. The scenarios were not differentiated apart from their maps, however: players continued to see Venetian gondolas and St Mark's in \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"compete[d] to become the Doge of China or the Pope of Asia\\". Game history Merchant Prince was written by Several Dudes Holistic Gaming and released by Quantum Quality Productions (QQP) in 1993. Ed Pike credited his rereading of Machiavelli's Prince during the 1992 US presidential election, along with post-Watergate American politics generally, for his concept of the game. Pike said he aimed to \\"provide food for thought about our current times while remaining entertaining and not overly depressing\\". HDI also considered setting the game during the Roman Republic, but decided against that due to the numerous other Roman games then on the market. In 1995, the renamed Holistic Design (HDI) and Microprose re-released it under the name Machiavelli the Prince. (Notwithstanding that Machiavelli was a Florentine and not a Venetian, the change was necessary owing to copyright issues.) Cities no longer accepted unlimited amounts of goods, particularly for high-value goods like relics and precious metals. The graphics were improved, along with aspects of the interface that (e.g.) permitted easier grouping of units, clarified the trade status of cities, and displayed the routes of long-distance ships. Ending the turn no longer required visiting Venice first. Machiavelli was released in two boxes: a thinner purple box with just the game and a thicker black box that included George Bull's Penguin translation of Machiavelli's Prince. Out of the box, the game usually crashed almost immediately if computer opponents were set at any difficulty except Novice. A patch (v.1.1) was released to fix the bug. HDI and TalonSoft (an imprint of Take-Two) released Merchant in 2001. Only small galleys and light guards were available at game start; other aspects of the game now had to be unlocked via payments to a Leonardo figure. Additional new \\"technologies\\" made the units further resistant to disasters or weakened opponents. Players who wanted to focus on trade could disable this feature and play with the units of the earlier games. Merchant attempted to allow simultaneous movement in multiplayer games but the option was notoriously buggy. A patch (v.1.1) was also released to fix several bugs, particularly with its TCP/IP multiplayer mode.  Multiplayer  Merchant Prince offered three multiplayer options: taking turns at a single computer (hotseat) or connecting two computers via cable (null modem) or internet (modem). Hotseat play supports up to four players; cable and modem play are limited to two human players against two computer opponents. Machiavelli added features to ease play by e-mail (PBEM), which supports up to four players. Merchant Prince II introduced TCP/IP support, but some players reported difficulties, including buggy trade routes. Reception While warning that the game emphasized trade and popularity over conquest or destroying enemies, Computer Gaming World stated in April 1994 that \\"Merchant Prince is a finely balanced, well presented, and intensely enjoyable game\\" with random maps and online play giving it \\"considerable replay value\\". In June 1994 it was a finalist for the magazine's Strategy Game of the Year award, losing to Master of Orion. The editors wrote that the game \\"captures the greed and treachery of medieval Italy even more than the classic Machiavelli boardgame\\". Computer Game Review gave it a platinum triad award (high marks from three reviewers) before naming it the magazine's 1994 strategy game of the year.

During the 1990s, inspired by the grunge sound, Dimo and Ivan (guitarist), the core of band, found Resemblance with musicians from later formed group Crowfish. In 1992, they had already created around 40 records in English. They even lived in Hungary and held performances there for a month. After that period, they decided to return to Bulgaria and try singing in their mother language. They moved to the capital Sofia, and Resemblance fell apart. Pavlin Bachvarov (pianist), Valeri Cenkov (drummer), and Emilian Bonev (bassist) joined Dimo and Ivan to form P.I.F.  Patriots in Fashion  In 2000, their first album P.I.F. (Patriots in Fashion) is released. The song called Prikazka (in Bulgarian \\"–ü—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑–∫–∞\\") became an unprecedented hit. From that point they grew popularity and a number of songs from this album such as Kolelo (\\"–ö–æ–ª–µ–ª–æ\\"), Vali (\\"–í–∞–ª–∏\\"), Patuvane (\\"–ü—ä—Ç—É–≤–∞–Ω–µ\\"), Nevidimo Dete (\\"–ù–µ–≤–∏–¥–∏–º–æ –î–µ—Ç–µ\\"), Kambanite (\\"–ö–∞–º–±–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–µ\\") became very recognizable to the growing number of fans and the general public. Each song has its own history which are regularly shared with the audience by the frontman, Dimo, during their live performances. Patriots In Fashion won an award for Best Album of the Year the same year it was released.  Pictures in Frames  Their second album is called P.I.F. (Pictures in Frames), and it was released in 2001. In an interview, the band said they have separated themselves from the hustle-bustle in Sofia for several weeks in a villa in the Rila Mountain; this explained why its sound is a bit out-of-time-out-of-space. With their unique ways of creating music, the group continued gaining popularity. However, Dimo shared that the album was created in a very difficult period for the band, as at that time he was divorcing from his wife, and pianist Liub–æ was leaving the band. That time was recorded a song called Obarkvacia (\\"–û–±—ä—Ä–∫–≤–∞—Ü–∏—è\\") and the music video was shot. It showed vocalist and guitarist of the band kidding in a room with sofa. During the chorus appeared a little girl and two persons with \\"fish\\" and \\"elephant\\" heads. The song mixed elements of blues rock, punk rock and reggae. The song was not included in the album because the musicians said that it represented the confusion and chaos of the time it was composed.  Passion in Fact  In 2004, after a tour around Europe, P.I.F. stabilized and enlarged into six members. Guitarist Hristo Hristov, bassist Martin Nikolov, and drummer Atanas Kasabov joined the group. They made their tour in December and destinations included Paris, Cologne, Bochum, Karlsruhe, Viens and others. In 2006, a new album was released: P.I.F. (Passion in Fact).

It was not until the mid 14th century that the name of the castle, which had been referred to as castrum Ortinberg as early as 1233, was given to the town. The castle was destroyed in 1678. However, it was rebuilt by Leonhard von Berckholtz in the 19th century.

The towers, however, are open for visitors. The castle-like construction, as it stands today, was planned by the German architect Friedrich Eisenlohr and built between 1838 and 1843 by Gabriel Leonhard von Beckholtz, a livonian merchant. The ruins of the former castle, which had been destroyed in 1678, provided the basis for re-construction. Contrary to popular opinion, only the municipality Ortenberg but not the district Ortenau was named after this castle. This term was derived from the former term Mortenau (Latin Moridunum = marshland). The initial consonant was lost in the 16th century due to colloquialism. B√ºhlerweg chapel was constructed in 1497 and has been used ecumenically since 1972. St. Bartholomew parish church was constructed by Hans Vo√ü in a style similar to Weinbrenner's architecture. Marie Ellender created the paintings in Nazarene style that can be found by the altar.  Economy and infrastructure  Ortenberg is a municipality in which wine is grown. It is part of the wine-growing region of Ortenau in the wine-growing area of Baden. = Transport = Even though Ortenberg is located on Black Forest Railway, which leads from Offenburg to Singen, the train station has been out of use since the 1980s.

Pulse~LINK's CWave implementations of C-UWB can support the simultaneous operation of IEEE 1394, Gigabit Ethernet and HDMI-equivalent connections with end-to-end quality of service (QoS). Pulse~LINK developed a set of integrated circuits for Media Access Control (MAC) and radio frequency (RF) layers, and later brought a single integrated MCM module incorporating the baseband/mac/rf plus system ram. After joining both the UWB Forum and WiMedia Alliance in 2004, in February 2005, it positioned its technology as a third alternative to the technologies promoted by the after groups. It had raised $38 million by then. Demonstrations were shown at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2008, including a television from Westinghouse Digital. By January 2009, more competing technologies such as WirelessHD were demonstrated at CES. By March 2009, the company reduced its staff and was looking for new investors. After spending an estimated $100 million on research and development, in December 2012 a company reorganization was announced, with Brady Buckley appointed the new chief executive.

It was the first historic redevelopment in the U.S. to receive a gold-level Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) award from the U.S. Green Building Council. The building houses a mix of public and private, nonprofit and for-profit tenants.BuildingGreen, Inc. \\"High Performance Buildings Database: Jean Vollum Natural Capital Center, Overview\\" U.S. Green Building Council, Cascadia Chapter website. Accessed May 10, 2007. History and redevelopment The timber and brick structure that is now the Natural Capital Center was built in 1895 as a warehouse for the J. McCraken Company, who used it until 1902 and continued to own it for some years thereafter. The building's recessed rounded-arch entry, arched window openings and massive heft exemplify the Romanesque style. Located between two railroad freight yards, the McCraken wholesale company distributed Monterey sand, Tenino sandstone and other building supplies. In 1929, the building became the Portland Truck Terminal, a freight terminal used by around 20 trucking companies. Then from 1941 to 1997 it housed the Rapid Transfer & Storage Company. In 1998, Ecotrust, a nonprofit conservation organization, purchased the building with a donation from then board member Jean Vollum. Redevelopment of the building cost $12.4 million and was completed in September 2001. The idea that a conservation organization would shift focus from protecting forests and watersheds to participating in urban renewal was an unusual and controversial one. Ecotrust board member Jane Jacobs and Ecotrust council member Stewart Brand were notable supporters of the plan. Re-opened to the public in 2001, the building was named the Natural Capital Center to reflect the ideas in ecological economics. The Natural Capital Center was the first LEED gold-certified building in the Pacific Northwest. The building has a mix of \\"green\\" tenants, including Patagonia, Hot Lips Pizza, ShoreBank Pacific, and Portfolio 21. The City of Portland's Office of Sustainable Development, created in 2001, was originally located in the Natural Capital Center, occupying in the building. It moved out in 2009, after being merged with the City's Planning Bureau and renamed the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability.

The story is set in an unnamed port city in Africa which resembles Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, where the author often lived and worked. The narrator is a baker who finds a ten-year-old boy called Nelio. The boy has been shot on the stage of a theatre, and he tells the baker his life story and all his troubles, including living on the street, being persecuted for albinism, and being traumatized as a child soldier. Nelio is \\"presented as an inspirational figure\\" in a style derived from African storytelling. The novel was translated by Tiina Nunnally and published in English in 2006.  Background  Mankell is known for his \\"socially aware crime fiction\\" with Inspector Kurt Wallander as a central character. He was fascinated by Africa where he traveled first in the 1970s. From 1987, he lived and worked in both Africa and Sweden. From 1986 on he was director of the Teatro Avenida in Maputo, Mozambique. In great contrast to the inspector, who has been described as \\"a morose, self-loathing plainclothes officer\\", the novel deals with the life of the street boy Nelio and his death at age ten. Mankell said that \\"the story unfolds in a manner derived from African storytelling\\". He favorably compared that style to what he considered that of the typical (chronological) European story: \\"The African way is much more adventurous. You can jump between realities. You can let dead people meet with living people\\".  Plot  The story is set in an unnamed port city in Africa, told in the first-person by a baker, Jos√© M. V. He finds Nelio, a 10-year-old boy, shot on the stage of a theatre. He helps the wounded child who refuses medical care, and listens to the story the boy has to tell over the course of nine days before he dies. Market in Maputo Nelio says he grew up in a village close to the border. The village was destroyed during a civil war by partisans, who killed his father, sister, and many others, and deported him and his mother to a camp from which he escapes. He meets Yabu Bata, who has albinism. Together they reach the sea, and Nelio alone moves to a port city. He lives as a street boy, sleeping in the monument of a rider. He joins a gang of other homeless street children led by a 14-year-old boy. They live off waste, stealing, and earning a little money by watching the cars of the rich. A happy event is the birthday of Alfredo Bomba, which they celebrate in an empty house of a man who travels. Alfredo is diagnosed as terminally ill. To make his last days as pleasant as possible, the group wants to perform a play. Alfredo enjoys the performance in a theatre and dies. Watchmen notice the children and everyone is able to flee except Nelio, who stays with the corpse and is shot. Nelio dies nine days later. Jos√© decides to give up his profession and travel as the chronicler, telling Nelio's story, reasoning: \\"I kept asking myself: where does the evil in human beings come from? Why does barbarism always wear a human face? That's what makes barbarism so inhuman\\".  Publication  The novel was published in 1995 by Ordfront in Stockholm. It was published in English, translated by Tiina Nunnally, in 2006 by Harvill Secker, and in several other languages.  Reception  A reviewer in The Observer writes: \\"The genocide that forces Nelio out of his village and the degradation suffered by the street children are described in angry detail\\", but also sees that Nelio is \\"presented as an inspirational figure\\", even with magical powers. A reviewer for The New York Times notes \\"crisscrossing time and space in a story that is at once wrenchingly tragic and uplifting\\".  Awards  The novel was nominated for the August Prize and the Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1995. In 1996 it was awarded the novel prize of the Swedish broadcaster SR P1.  Films  The novel became a 1998 Portuguese language film entitled '. The film, a Sweden‚ÄìPortugal‚ÄìMozambique co- production, was nominated for a Guldbagge Award for best film in 1999. Mankell and director Jens Monath produced a film, Mein Herz schl√§gt in Afrika (My Heart Beats in Africa), which was aired in two parts by the ZDF in spring 2009. It was based on topics from the novel such as the life of street children, the persecution of people with albinism, and young adults who are traumatized by spending their childhood as child soldiers.

The court consists of twenty three judges, elected by the same institution in list conformed by the Superior Council of the Judiciary for individual terms of eight years. The court meets at the Palace of Justice in the Bol√≠var Square of Bogota. History After the Colombian first declaration of independence from Spain on 20 July 1810, a number of independent States like Tunja (1811), Antioquia (1812), Cartagena de Indias (1812) and Cundinamarca (1812) were established. Each State had its own body in charge of the administration of justice. Later, when these States established the Provincias Unidas de la Nueva Granada (United Provinces of New Granada), on 23 September 1814, the Alto Tribunal de Justicia (High Tribunal of Justice) was established. In 1819, the Republic of Colombia (the Gran Colombia) was born. A Court was created according to the provisions its Constitution of 30 August 1821, named Alta Corte de Justicia (High Court of Justice). In 1830, the Gran Colombia was dissolved and the Republic of New Granada was formed. As per the provisions of its Constitution of 29 February 1832, the Corte Suprema de Justicia (Supreme Court of Justice) was established. On 20 May 1853, it became the Corte Suprema de la Naci√≥n (Supreme Court of the Nation). In 1858, the Grenadine Confederation was founded. On adoption of its Constitution of 22 May 1858, the Courte Suprema (Supreme Court) became the body in charge of the administration of justice. In 1863, the Grenadine Confederation was replaced by the Estados Unidos de Colombia (United States of Colombia). On adoption of its Constitution of 8 May 1863, the Corte Suprema Federal (Supreme Federal Court) was established. Finally, after the establishment of the Rep√∫blica de Colombia (Republic of Colombia) and on adoption of its Constitution of August 4, 1886, the body was renamed as the present, the Corte Suprema de Justicia (Supreme Court of Justice) on 3 September 1886. Its first President was Rito Antonio Mart√≠nez. In 1985 in the Palace of Justice siege, members of the M-19 guerrilla group took over the Palace of Justice, and held the Supreme Court hostage, intending to put President Belisario Betancur on trial.

History Simon K√©zai, the chronicler of Ladislaus IV of Hungary wrote his history in the years 1282‚Äì83. In this work he reported that Prince Emeric, the son of King B√©la III married Constance of Aragon. The Spanish princess was escorted to Hungary by an extremely beautiful woman, called T√≥ta, who later became the wife of Prince Benedict, the voivode of Transylvania. It was in a document of 1202 where King Emeric gave his permission to Benedict to bestow the settlement of Baj√≥t on T√≥ta, as a wedding gift. This document was the first written mention of the settlement's name and it appeared there as Boitth. The document is closed with a golden seal and today it is kept in the State Archives of the City of Vienna. In 1221 King Andrew II returned the property to T√≥ta, which had formerly been taken away from her when her husband, Benedict had been exiled. Following T√≥ta's death her Spanish brother, comes Simon obtained the property. Simon's family later adopted the name Nagymartoni, since in addition to Baj√≥t they also owned the settlement of Nagymarton (today in Burgenland, Austria, by its present‚Äìday name Mattersburg). The members of the Nagymartoni family began to call themselves Frakn√≥i from the mid-14th century onward. Their dynasty died out with Paul IV in 1438. Their coat-of-arms originally was a simple shield tinctured gules. As charges it bore two crosses in the upper chief and an eagle abais√© in the middle. The bird is turning to the sinister and looking at the cross borne on the dexter side of the shield. These charges were likely to have been bestowed on Simon as well as his brother Mih√°ly by the Spanish king. Their figures might appear as the characters of Mikhal and Simon of Boioth in J√≥zsef Katona‚Äôs tragedy entitled B√°nk B√°n. Before Simon and Mih√°ly moved to Hungary they had defeated the sultan of Tunis and had occupied the islands of Mallorca and Menorca for the Spanish king. It was the same Simon and his archers who defended the castle of Esztergom from the attacks of the Mongols in the spring of 1242. This is why an arrowhead is borne in the sinister field of the settlement's coat-of-arms. Until quite recently the archbishops of Esztergom were the chief landowners of Baj√≥t. The charges of the settlement's coat-of- arms give a simple and a clear introduction to the settlement's history. The main charges of Baj√≥t's coat-of-arms are as follows: a bishop's mitre in the sinister chief, an arrowhead in the dexter chief and an eagle in the centre, borne abais√© in a field gules.http://www.nemzetijelkepek.hu/onkormanyzat- bajot_en.shtml References External links * Street map (Hungarian) Category:Populated places in Kom√°rom-Esztergom County ","title":"Baj√≥t"},{"id":"11177532","text":"The Chatham Island pigeon (Hemiphaga chathamensis) or parea (from its Moriori name) is a bird endemic to the Chatham Islands in New Zealand. Growing to 800g in weight and 55 cm in length, the Chatham Island pigeon is closely related to the kerer≈´ or New Zealand pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae), the only other species in the genus Hemiphaga. While rated vulnerable by IUCN, it is considered critically threatened in New Zealand. After the population declined to 40 birds in the late 1980s, conservation efforts have helped their numbers increase to around 500 birds, largely restricted to the southern forests of Chatham Island (particularly those around the Tuku River). A few have been seen elsewhere on Chatham Island and also further afield on Pitt and South East Islands.Barrie Heather and Hugh Robertson, \\"The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand\\" (revised edition), Viking, 2005 They were common in the 1870s but habitat destruction and predation by mammalian invasive species reduced the population to only 40 birds by 1990. Since then, predator control and stock fencing in and around the Tuku valley have resulted in improved breeding success which has led to rapid population growth. Chatham pigeon or parea foraging in a grassy field Traditionally considered a subspecies of the kereru, it was proposed in 2001 to be distinct enough to be raised to full species status.Millener, P. R., and R. G. Powlesland. (2001). The Chatham Island pigeon (Chatham pigeon) deserves full species status; Hemiphaga chathamensis (Rothschild 1891); Aves: Columbidae. Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand 31:365-383.Clements, J. (2007). The Clements Checklist of the Birds of the World. Edition 6. Christopher Helm. Dickinson, E. (2003). The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World. Edition 3. Christopher Helm. Because the Chatham Islands have been separated from the mainland of New Zealand for so long, the Chatham pigeon has evolved differently from its mainland relative, the kereru. There are a number of differences between the two pigeons. The Chatham pigeon is around 20% heavier than the kereru and it has a heavier bill. Unlike the kereru it has an enlarged hind toe which helps it to scrabble about on the forest floor. The Chatham pigeon generally nests from June to October, while the kereru nests from September to January. The Chatham pigeon nests in bracken or fern near the ground while the kereru prefers to nest in a tree, out of harm's way. The Chatham pigeon's egg is also much bigger. Chatham pigeon feed on the fruits of the hoho (Pseudopanax chathamicus), matipo, mahoe and karamu tree, and the foliage of mahoe, hoho and clover. The succulent fruits of the hoho are especially sought after. They are at their best in August and September, which coincides with the peak of the pigeon's breeding season. Chatham pigeon is renowned for their spectacular flying dives, especially by the males, to attract a mate. Most breed at 1 to 2 years of age, laying just one egg. Chicks fledge at about 45 days old and become independent at 3 months. They have a life expectancy of up to 25 years. References Further reading *Hutching, G. (2004). Back from the Brink.

In 1335, the duchies were ceded to the Kingdom of Bohemia under the Treaty of Trentschin. Thereafter until 1742, Silesia was one of the Bohemian crown lands and lay within the Holy Roman Empire. Most of Silesia was annexed by the King of Prussia under the Treaty of Berlin in 1742. Only the Duchy of Teschen, the Duchy of Troppau and the Duchy of Nysa remained under the control of the Bohemian crown and as such were known as the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia until 1918. Breakup of Polish Silesia (1138‚Äì1335) In the (vain) hope to prevent an inheritance dispute, the Piast prince Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth by his last will and testament had divided Poland into hereditary provinces distributed among his four sons: Masovia, Kujawy, Greater Poland and Silesia. Beside which, the Seniorate Province (Lesser Poland) with the residence of Krak√≥w was reserved for the eldest, who according to the principle of agnatic seniority was to be High Duke of all Poland. This act inadvertently started the process known as Fragmentation of Poland. Boles≈Çaw's son W≈Çadys≈Çaw II received the Duchy of Silesia and, as the eldest, was also granted the title of a High Duke among with the Seniorate Province. Nevertheless, after he had tried to gain control over all Poland, he was banned and expelled by his younger half-brothers in 1146. Boles≈Çaw's second eldest son Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly, Duke of Masovia, became Polish High Duke. When, in 1163, W≈Çadys≈Çaw's three sons, backed by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa returned to Poland, Boles≈Çaw IV had to restore their heritage. After ten years of joint rule, W≈Çadys≈Çaw's sons finally divided Silesia in 1173: *Boles≈Çaw I the Tall, the eldest, received the core territory around the residences of Wroc≈Çaw, Legnica and Opole. In 1180, he granted the Duchy of Opole to his son Jaros≈Çaw, who ruled until his death in March 1201. Upon Boles≈Çaw's death in December 1201, his lands were inherited by his only remaining son Henry I the Bearded. *Mieszko I Tanglefoot became Duke of Racib√≥rz and received Bytom and O≈õwiƒôcim in 1177. *Konrad Spindleshanks (Konrad Laskonogi), the youngest, in 1177 also claimed his rights and received the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w from his brother Boles≈Çaw, who after Konrad's death about 1180/90 again inherited it.

He ruled over the Racib√≥rz and Opole duchies, which emerged as Upper Silesia, until his death in 1211. Henry I the Bearded remained sovereign of the Lower Silesian Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw, he acquired the Greater Polish lands of Kalisz in 1206, which he granted to his Piast cousin W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, as well as Lubusz Land in 1210. High Duke of Poland from 1232, he conquered further Greater Polish territories around Santok in 1234. Mieszko's heir was Duke Casimir I of Opole, who died in 1230. Thereupon, Henry I managed to reunite whole Silesia under his reign. He was succeeded by his son Henry II the Pious in 1238, while Upper Silesia was inherited by Casimir's son Mieszko II the Fat in 1239. He and his younger brother, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolski, had already received Greater Polish Kalisz in 1234. Henry II was killed at the Battle of Legnica in 1241. His eldest son and heir, Duke Boles≈Çaw II the Bald temporarily gave Lubusz Land to his younger brother Mieszko (‚Ä† 1242). He reconciled with his Greater Polish cousin Duke Przemys≈Ç I and finally returned Santok in 1247 and remained sole ruler of Lower Silesia until 1248. Mieszko II the Fat, of Upper Silesia, in 1244, returned Kalisz to Duke Przemys≈Ç I of Greater Poland. He died in 1246 and his possessions were inherited by his brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolski.

At the Congress of Visegr√°d in 1335 it was agreed that John would abandon his claim and in return receive the suzerainty of the Silesian duchies and a one-time payment. This was finalized in the Treaty of Trentschin on 24 August 1335, although some Piast-ruled duchies remained outside of Bohemian suzerainty for the following decades. Under the Bohemian crown, the duchies continued to be ruled by branches of the Piast dynasty known as the Silesian Piasts until their lineages died out in 1675. When a ducal lineage died out, the duchy passed to the crown and became a state country. The Bohemian Crown passed to the House of Habsburg in 1526. In 1742, most of Silesia was annexed by Prussia following the First Silesian War. This was confirmed following the Second Silesian War in 1745 and the Third Silesian War in 1763. Following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Bohemian Silesia remained a part of the Austrian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire down to its dissolution in 1918.

Established in the 1790s, the graveyard contains the graves of some of Knoxville's most prominent early residents, including territorial governor and Constitutional Convention delegate William Blount and Knoxville founder James White.Jack Neely, The Marble City: A Photographic Tour of Knoxville's Graveyards (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), pp. xvi-xix. In 1996, the graveyard was added to the National Register of Historic Places. While platting Knoxville with his son-in-law, Charles McClung, in 1791, White ordered at least one lot to be set aside for a church and cemetery. The cemetery spot may have been used as early as the 1780s for burials, and the cemetery contained several graves by 1799, but the earliest marker is Blount's, dated 1800. While the First Presbyterian congregation was active in the 1790s, the first church was not built on the site until 1816. The graveyard was used for burials for nearly sixty years, its most active period being during the Epidemic of 1838, in which hundreds of Knoxvillians died from an unidentified illness. History Marker of Knoxville's founder, James White In 1790, after his fort was chosen as the capital for the newly created Southwest Territory, James White asked his son-in-law, surveyor Charles McClung, to lay out a new town, named \\"Knoxville\\" after Secretary of War Henry Knox. McClung initially divided the town into 64 half-acre (0.2-ha) lots, and added additional lots in 1795, with the cemetery lot being included in the later additions.William MacArthur, Jr., Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South (Tulsa: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), pp. 17-22. While the cemetery was not officially platted until 1795, historians speculate that burials likely occurred before that date. When Moravian missionary Frederick de Schweinitz passed through Knoxville in 1799, he reported that the cemetery already had numerous burials. The First Presbyterian congregation was organized by the Reverend Samuel Carrick in the 1790s, and the first church was erected adjacent to the cemetery in 1816. Shortly after the church's completion, disputes arose over several matters, including the renting of pews, and a doctrinal dispute between \\"Old Calvinists\\" and \\"Hopkinsians\\". A portion of the congregation split from First Presbyterian, and founded Second Presbyterian Church circa 1818. First Presbyterian Church, c. 1906 In 1838, hundreds Knoxvillians died when an unknown illness (possibly malaria) swept through the town. Approximately one-tenth of the marked graves in the graveyard are dated \\"1838\\" more than any other single year and one tombstone mentions \\"the fever.\\" The graveyard was open to new burials until 1857, but the last burial took place in 1879.First Presbyterian Church Knoxville  Graveyard. Retrieved: 11 January 2013. During the Civil War, Confederate soldiers (who occupied the town 1861-1863) kept horses in the cemetery, and Union soldiers (who occupied the town 1863-1865) used the church as a hospital and barracks. Humorist George Washington Harris (1814-1869), an ardent Presbyterian, served as an elder of the First Presbyterian Church during his years in Knoxville. Two of his children, Harriet (1838-1846) and George (1841-1842), are buried in the graveyard.Jack Neely, Knoxville's Secret History (Scruffy Books, 1995), pp. 46-7. In the 1870s, the graveyard had an indirect effect on the career of future newspaper publisher, Adolph Ochs. Ochs, then a young teenager working after hours as a \\"printer's devil\\" for the Knoxville Chronicle, feared walking past the graveyard at night, as many locals believed it to be haunted. Rather than leave work after his shift (which ended close to midnight), Ochs stayed until daylight, spending the extra time learning the typesetting and printing trades.Doris Faber, Printer's Devil to Publisher: Adolph S. Ochs of the New York Times (New York Messner, 1963), pp. 24-25. The present First Presbyterian Church, constructed in 1903, is a Neoclassical building, with a Tiffany-style stained glass window. Layout and marker styles The First Presbyterian Church Graveyard resembles a traditional early Anglo-American cemetery, with graves crowded together and marked by relatively simple headstones. Most of the headstones are polished, upright stones, although a few (such as the Blounts') are flat stones. Most are adorned with simple inscriptions noting the deceased's name, date of death, and number of years lived. A low iron fence surrounds the graveyard's perimeter, and crude stone walkways allow access.

After the death of Agathocles (289 BCE), his supposed assassin, Maenon, put to death Archagathus, the grandson of Agathocles; and assuming the command of the army with which the latter was besieging Aetna, directed his arms against Syracuse. Hereupon Hicetas was sent against him by the Syracusans, with a considerable army: but after the war had continued for some time, without any decisive result, Maenon, by calling in the aid of the Carthaginians, obtained the superiority, and the Syracusans were compelled to conclude an ignominious peace. Soon after ensued the revolution which led to the expulsion of the Campanian mercenaries, afterwards known as the Mamertines: and it must have been shortly after this that Hicetas established himself in the supreme power, as we are told by Diodorus that he ruled nine years. The only events of his government that are recorded are a war with Phintias, tyrant of Agrigentum (modern Agrigento), in which he obtained a considerable victory, and one with the Carthaginians, by whom he was defeated at the river Terias. He was at length expelled from Syracuse by Thynion, an event which took place not long before the arrival of Pyrrhus in Sicily, and must therefore be referred either to 279 BCE or 278 BCE, either of which dates is consistent enough with the period of nine years allotted to his reign by Diodorus. (Diod. Exc.

It was originally the residence of Julia Felix, who converted portions of it to apartments available for rent and other parts for public use after the major earthquake in 62 AD, a precursor to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that destroyed Pompeii. Archaeological excavations began in 1755 and the remains of the House of Julia Felix can be visited today. Background Julia Felix's property took up an entire insula, or block of land, at the height of her ownership and business. After the 62 AD earthquake she converted it into luxurious baths and leisure gardens for public use, as well as apartments for rent.Dobbins, John; Foss, Pedar (2007). The World of Pompeii. New York: Routledge: Taylor and Francis Group. p. 237 Scholars disagree on Julia Felix's upbringing and the ways in which she inherited the money needed to create a villa; some believe Julia Felix was a \\"low-born, illegitimate daughter of Spurius\\", others believe she was descended from imperial freedmen. Renting out her villa established herself as a property owner, business woman, and public figure in Pompeii. During Julia Felix's lifetime, laws were implemented limiting women from owning property without a male figure or guardian. Some Roman women were able to own land and other types of property if they were independent of their fathers, husbands, or male guardians. If legal guardians were required, they would have to approve actions involving the transferring of women's property. Elite women were able to bypass the need for a guardian in property ownership and property transfer. Architecture Portico and garden The House of Julia Felix was a combination of indoor and outdoor areas built around atria, courtyards into which the main rooms opened, with enclosed gardens and private water supply; Sections of the praedia allowed for indoor and outdoor seating with frescoes depicting landscapes of leisure and gardens. The sumptuousness of the architecture and the quality of the decoration indicate that the praedia were intended for richer and higher status customers.  Inside the villa  Triclinium with waterfall Still life with Eggs and Game, a wall painting from the House of Julia Felix Still life with Glass Fruit Bowl and Vases The walls are still almost completely covered with frescoes. The tablinum facing onto the large garden to the east must have been spectacular with its particularly fine paintings, Fourth-Style frescoes consisting of dados painted with green plants on a black background, a central zone of red and yellow panels with villas, sanctuaries and flying figures with a set of Apollo and the Muses and another with a frieze of still-life panels. The frescoes within the House of Julia Felix often depicted small-time merchants and the lifestyles of every day Pompeian citizens. The summer triclinium and baths were some of the most extravagant aspects of the house used by the tenants. The dining room was elegant and welcoming and like those of the wealthiest citizens of Pompeii who owned villas in the countryside and on the coast and overlooked the gardens that incorporated small pools and waterfalls. The fully equipped and elegant baths were intended for only respectable citizens of Pompeii. They must have been well-used, since most of the public baths in Pompeii were closed for repairs after the damage caused by in the earthquake of AD 62. In the large garden at the rear, fruit trees were enclosed in large squares formed by low wooden fences. Excavations The earliest known excavation was in 1755 under the direction of R.J de Alcubierre and his assistant K. Weber and was essentially treasure hunting, focussed on recovering valuable objects and paintings for the collection of the Bourbon royal family at Portici. The building was then reburied. Fortunately Weber drew a plan of the building, labelling where objects or paintings had been removed, which is priceless for reconstructing today the details of the decoration. Parts of the villa revealed during the first excavation were a taberna, luxurious baths, and richly decorated formal garden dining rooms. Another excavation during 1912‚Äì1935 uncovered a shrine and the fa√ßade of the building, the side facing the Via dell'Abbondanza. Between 1998‚Äì1999 some of the most important discoveries were made; a nymphaeum or grotto of nymphs with a water-stair fountain and triclinium was a modification after the earthquake of 62 AD.

Today, CU Online offers degree programs from all four University of Colorado campuses ‚Äì CU Boulder, CU Colorado Springs, CU Denver, and CU Anschutz Medical Campus. Through CU Online, the pedagogy of the University of Colorado faculty is extended globally, allowing local, national, international students the opportunity to partake in the same education as their on-campus counterparts. CU Online initially launched with three online courses. In 2020 CU Online has expanded its catalog to over 50 degree and certificate programs that can be completed entirely online. CU Online programs offer the same curriculum, credit structure, and are taught by the same on-campus professors. The student-faculty ratio also remains the same for both on-campus and online courses [http://www.ucdenver.edu/admissions/Pages/index.aspx (roughly 17:1).  Program Structure  Most CU Online degree programs run on a traditional semester schedule, where they start and stop at the same time as the on-campus classes (Fall, Spring, Summer). As such, the online courses are not \\"self- paced\\", but rather are \\"asynchronous\\", which means students can log in any time of day or night. The amount of time students are expected to be logged in is dependent upon the professor and degree program. Each online course is developed to convey and teach the same content and material as its on-campus counterpart, but in a way that‚Äôs conducive to the web-based modality. Each student is assigned a homepage in order to: *Access courses *Participate in class discussions (threaded discussions and ‚Äòchat‚Äô with peers) *Find assignments, lectures, and exams CU Online employs Canvas by Instructure. Canvas is Cloud based, and CU Denver uses it for its completely online courses as well a supplement for the on campus courses in the form of blended learning, which means it doesn‚Äôt distinguish between supplemental course use and blended/hybrid courses. With Canvas, professors can record audio and video messages, utilize IOS and Android, RSS support and web conferencing.  Assignments  The online courses that compose CU Online‚Äôs degree and certificate programs are typically divided into units of class discussions (ongoing posts of classmate queries and comments), downloadable assignments, and quizzes. What students are actually graded on is based on the course and the professor, however, class participation is usually required in the form of threaded discussions. Similar to a traditional on-campus course, the content of the course is subject to the discretion of the professor.  Lectures  With CU Online, lectures are delivered from various formats, such as: *Streaming audio, video, YouTube, etc. *Discussion boards and blogs *Multimedia slide shows *Email  Exams  Exams are taken and administered in a variety of ways. They can be administered \\"online\\" by using course software with an internet browser (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.), as a ‚Äútake home‚Äù exam where the exam is printed out and handed in, or \\"proctored\\" by outside parties, instructor, or the teaching assistant (TA) at a designated location. A 24/7 help desk is also available for both students and faculty.  Programs  The credits earned through CU Online are identical to credits earned through traditional on-campus courses; even if a student completes an entire program online, the degree is awarded with the same benefactor, University of Colorado. CU Online offers courses in liberal arts and science, arts and media, business, education, engineering, public affairs, healthcare, nursing, and more.

During his time at the club he rose from office boy to vice-president and became known as \\"Mr. Sheffield Wednesday\\". Early life and office boy Taylor was born in the Sheffield suburb of Fulwood in May 1912, although he spent his formative years in Birley Carr very close to the Sheffield Wednesday ground. He rapidly gained a lifelong love of the club, slipping into the ground to see the final few minutes of games when the gates were opened. Taylor started his working life in a law office but In 1929, at the age of 17, he was appointed by Wednesday as office boy to the manager Bob Brown on a wage of seven shillings and sixpence a week. Wednesday had won the First Division championship in the 1928-29 season and it is said the appointment was a reward to the manager for this. In November 1934 Taylor was promoted to the post of assistant secretary when Joe McClelland departed and he remained in this role until 1942. Adrian Bullock‚Äòs Wednesday Archive Gives short biography. Part-time football during the Second World War saw Wednesday having to make financial savings and team manager Jimmy McMullan was told that his contract would not be renewed for 1942. Club Chairman William Turner reshuffled the remaining staff and Eric Taylor was given the additional job of part-time manager of team affairs. It seems that Taylor‚Äôs rise to team manager was only to be a temporary appointment until the end of the war; he had never played or coached league football. However, he made a good impression in the job and led Wednesday to the final of the North Football League War Cup in 1943, losing to Blackpool over two legs. At the end of the war club chairman William Fearnehough rewarded Taylor with a new contract and the title of Secretary/Manager on 14 June 1945. Secretary / manager During his time as secretary/manager, Taylor was very much an office based manager. Seen rarely at the training ground, he had negligible input on tactics or team selection. Day to day training sessions were left to the coaches such as Bill Knox, Alan Brown or Jack Marshall with Taylor involved in watching potential signings and negotiating transfers. In Taylor‚Äôs first full season as manager after the war, Wednesday struggled and narrowly avoided relegation to Division Three North, however he slowly built a team which gained promotion back to Division One in the 1949-50 season. Throughout the 1950s Wednesday became known as a Yo-yo club being promoted or relegated on six occasions under Taylor‚Äôs management. Their best period during this time coincided with Taylor‚Äôs signing of Jackie Sewell for a British record transfer fee and the emergence of Derek Dooley as a prolific goalscorer. During this time they were Division Two champions in 1951-52 and then spent three consecutive seasons in Division one, but with little success. After another relegation back to Division Two in 1958, the board of directors and Taylor agreed that he should step down and Harry Catterick was brought in to become team manager.\\"The Wednesday Boys\\", Jason Dickinson & John Brodie, Pickard Communication, , pages 340, Gives general biography. Secretary / general manager Freed from responsibility for team affairs, Taylor showed flair and vision as an administrator for the club. After hearing that England were favourites to host the 1966 FIFA World Cup he was determined that Hillsborough Stadium would stage some of the group games in the competition. In preparation for this he travelled to Chile in 1962 to see that country's staging of the competition. As a result of Taylor‚Äôs groundwork, Hillsborough was chosen as one of the 1966 venues, receiving funding from the F.A. for ground redevelopment including the complete rebuilding of the Leppings Lane end. At the end of the World Cup Hillsborough was voted the best provincial venue in the competition. As a result of his efforts, Taylor was offered the post of Executive Secretary by the fledgling North American Soccer League to organise the new professional soccer league in the U.S.A. at the then very high salary of ¬£11,000 per annum. After much thought, Taylor stayed with Wednesday. In 1967 Taylor was involved in a serious car accident but recovered to return to his duties with Wednesday.\\"Eric Taylor: A Biography\\", Andrew Cooper, A. Cooper Publications 2011, , Gives general biography. Retirement, death and testimonial match In January 1974 Taylor announced that he would retire the following summer and he duly stepped down from his post on 30 July 1974. He was immediately named as vice-president of the club and agreed to act as a consultant. Just twelve weeks after retiring Taylor died on 23 September 1974, aged 62 years. On 21 October 1974 a testimonial match was held at Hillsborough in memory of Eric Taylor. The match was held between Sheffield Wednesday and an England XI; Don Revie had just been appointed England manager and he sent a strong team which won the match 5-0. Taylor is buried at Christ Church, Fulwood in Sheffield.

Towhee was named after the Towhee, a North American bird of the sparrow family. Towhee was laid down on 21 March 1944 at Cleveland, Ohio, by the American Ship Building Company; launched on 6 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. C. E. Connors; and commissioned on 18 May 1945, Lt. T. N. Humble, USNR, in command. Shakedown voyage Towhee departed Cleveland, Ohio, on 26 May, bound for the Massachusetts coast, via the Canadian ports of Montreal and Halifax, Nova Scotia, and arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, on 10 June. The minesweeper remained at this port through 23 July, undergoing a major overhaul, before proceeding to Little Creek, Virginia, for a continuation of overhaul and shakedown. Pacific Ocean operations  Leaving the Norfolk area on 21 September, Towhee headed south for Panama, transited the Panama Canal, and joined the Pacific Fleet on 30 September. A short availability at Craig Shipyard, San Pedro, California, in October prepared the ship for her departure from the west coast; and she got underway for Pearl Harbor on 3 November and arrived eight days later. On the 21st, the minesweeper departed the Hawaiian Islands, but an engineering casualty on the following day forced her return to Pearl Harbor. After spending a month under repair, Towhee again sailed for Japan on 28 December and proceeded via Eniwetok, Saipan, Guam, and Samar in the Philippines. Escorting YMS's, the minesweeper reached Sasebo on 1 February 1946 and commenced a short availability alongside for voyage repairs. Departing Sasebo for Saishu To, she spent one week in those waters and then shifted her operations to Tsushima before returning to Sasebo. Assigned as flagship, Task Unit 96.6.2, she participated in part of the gigantic minesweeping operations designed to clear the waters around the Japanese home islands of mines sown during the war and commenced her sweeps in Tsushima Strait on 17 March. East Coast operations  After a month of operations, Towhee departed Sasebo on 22 April, bound for the west coast, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. Towhee stood into San Diego, California, on 20 May before proceeding on to transit the Panama Canal on 9 June and rejoin the Atlantic Fleet. After a two-day layover at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, the minesweeper got underway north and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 17 June. Towhee remained on active duty with the Atlantic Fleet through 1953. Decommissioning  Towhee was decommissioned and laid up at Orange, Texas, in March 1954. On 7 February 1955, a fleet-wide redesignation of minecraft resulted in Towhee being redesignated as MSF-388. The minesweeper remained inactive through November 1963. Reactivation as Oceanographic Survey Ship  In December of that year, the ship proceeded to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Pennsylvania, for activation and conversion to an oceanographic survey ship to replace that was decommissioned and eventually scrapped. She was recommissioned on 1 April 1964 and redesignated as survey ship USS Towhee (AGS-28). East Coast survey operations  Assigned to Service Force, Atlantic Fleet, and homeported in Norfolk, Virginia, the ship completed underway training by July at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Towhee then commenced a series of five oceanographic survey operations through the summer of 1965 before assisting in builder's trials for a nuclear submarine in the late summer. Navigational difficulties caused a premature return from the ship's sixth survey operation in late October, necessitating a tender availability alongside before the survey ship departed Norfolk on 6 December and deployed once more for survey operations in the western Atlantic Ocean. The ship remained with the Atlantic Fleet through May 1966, when she underwent a tender availability alongside to prepare for shifting her operations back to the Pacific Upon completion of the tender availability, Towhee entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for installation of new communications equipment and air conditioning. Pacific Ocean survey operations  She departed the shipyard on 1 July and the Norfolk, Virginia area six days later, bound for Pearl Harbor. After stopovers at the Panama Canal Zone and at Mazatl√°n, Mexico, Towhee made port at Pearl Harbor on 12 August.Assigned to ServRon 5, the oceanographic survey vessel underwent voyage repairs soon after arriving in Hawaiian waters and continued availability through September. From 18 October to 5 November, the ship conducted underway training operations and refresher training. On 9 November, the ship got underway for her first Far Eastern deployment. After layovers at Guam in the Marianas and at Subic Bay in the Philippines, Towhee dropped anchor in Touraine Bay, off Da Nang, South Vietnam, on 9 December. Survey operations conducted between the time of her arrival and her departure on 12 January 1967 were frequently hampered by gale winds and high seas. The ship subsequently returned, via Subic Bay and Guam, to Hawaiian waters and reached Pearl Harbor on 6 February. Following a survey in the vicinity of Midway Island, the ship entered the naval shipyard at Pearl Harbor for 10 days of upkeep. Towhee then conducted underway training prior to entering ARD-SO for routine pre- deployment underwater hull inspection. Second WestPac deployment  On 18 September, Towhee departed Pearl Harbor, bound for the ship's second WestPac deployment, and stopped briefly at Guam en route to the Gulf of Thailand. Arriving off the western coast of Vietnam for survey operations during the latter part of October, Towhee's operations continued into December, when she made a visit to Bangkok, Thailand, over Christmas 1967. Towhee headed for Hawaii in April and conducted local operations in the Hawaiian area until 25 November 1968, when the survey ship headed for the west coast. Towhee underwent a material inspection on 19 and 20 March 1969 at the conclusion of her west coast deployment, and the surveying board found the ship unfit for further service. Decommissioning  Towhee was decommissioned on 30 April 1969, and custody was transferred to the Inactive Ship Facility at Vallejo, California On 1 May Towhee was struck from the Navy List and sold to the Learner Co. of Oakland, California, on 6 March for scrapping.

There was a meeting house on this site in 1653, although the current building may date from the late 17th century or early 18th century. It is one of the earliest surviving Baptist meeting houses. Since 1969 it has been owned by the National Trust. English Heritage have designated it a Grade II* listed building. The meeting house was founded by the Baptists of Kilmington, Devon, a village away to the southeast. Prior to the Act of Toleration 1689, the meeting house was illegal, but its location made it suitable as a refuge. It was built into a hillside, at that time surrounded by woodland and accessible only by narrow paths. Furthermore, it lay within a detached outlier of the county of Dorset, as the parish of Dalwood belonged to Dorset until 1842. From the outside it resembled a farm- worker's cottage apart from the gravestones surrounding it. It is still used for worship twice a year by the congregation of nearby Kilmington Baptist Church. The building is of stone rubble with buttresses and a thatched roof. The interior dates from the mid 18th century to early 19th century. The interior is set up as a preacher's house with a high pulpit at the centre front. On the left are box pews at right angles to the wall, and on the right some are square pews and the others are parallel with the wall. The musicians sat in the front pews of the gallery where they had their music rests. A notch in the floor was used for the foot of the bass viol. Two small rooms at the back of the meeting house were used for cooking the midday meal when the congregation met on Sundays for the entire day. Outside is the graveyard, the first interment being in 1659, and in the corner of the graveyard is a stable for the horses of those members who had come from far afield. There was also a baptismal pool. The earliest records go back to 1653, but the church had been in existence for some time before that. Two of the earliest members were John Vernon and William Allen who had been part of the victorious Parliamentary forces under General Fairfax in the English Civil War in 1645. Other early members had escaped from France, mostly being Huguenots, and because their names were difficult to pronounce, were known as \\"French\\". This remains a common surname among church members and in the vicinity.

Hicetas is first mentioned as a friend of Dion. After Dion's death in 353 BC, his widow Arete and his sister Aristomache turned to Hicetas for protection. Hicetas was willing to help them, but after a while he was persuaded otherwise by the enemies of Dion and accordingly he placed them on board a ship bound for Corinth, with secret instructions that they should be put to death during the voyage. (Plut. Dion, 58.) In the disorders that ensued, Hicetas succeeded in gaining control of Leontini, which became, after the return of the younger Dionysius, a rallying point for all the disaffected Syracusans. But while Hicetas secretly intended to expel Dionysius so that he could establish himself in his place, the fears of a Carthaginian invasion and the desire to restore tranquillity to the island led the Sicilians (including the Syracusan exiles) to send an embassy imploring assistance from Corinth. Hicetas ostensibly joined in the request, but as this was entirely opposed to his schemes, he at the same time entered into secret negotiations with the Carthaginians. Meanwhile, he had assembled a considerable force with which he attacked Syracuse. He managed to defeat Dionysius in a decisive action, making himself master of the whole city, except the island citadel, in which he kept the tyrant closely besieged. (Plut. Timol. 1, 2, 7, 9, 11; Diod. xvi. 65, 67, 68.) This was the state of things when Timoleon, having eluded the vigilance of the Carthaginians, landed in Sicily (344 BCE). Hicetas, learning that the general was advancing to occupy Adranum, led his forces there in anticipation of his arrival. However, Hicetas was defeated with heavy losses and, shortly afterwards, Dionysius surrendered the citadel into the hands of the Corinthian leader. Hicetas, finding that he had now to cope with a new enemy, and having failed in an attempt to rid himself of Timoleon by assassination, decided to openly seek the assistance of Carthage, and allowed Mago, at the head of a large fleet and army, into the port and city of Syracuse. Their joint operations were, however, unsuccessful. While they were engaged in an attempt upon Catana (modern Catania), Neon, the commander of the Corinthian garrison, recovered Achradina. Shortly afterwards Mago, alarmed at the disaffection among his mercenaries, and apprehensive of treachery, suddenly withdrew with all his forces and returned to Carthage. (Plut. Timol. 12, 13, 16‚Äî20; Diod. xvi. 68‚Äî70, who, however, erroneously places the departure of Mago before the surrender of Dionysius.) Hicetas was now unable to prevent Timoleon from making himself the master of Syracuse. Once Timoleon had settled affairs in Syracuse, he turned his arms against Leontini, and would probably have succeeded in expelling Hicetas from there as well, had not the Carthaginian invasion at that time required all his attention. But after his great victory in the Battle of the Crimissus (339 BC), Timoleon soon resumed his project of completely freeing Sicily from the tyrants. Hicetas had concluded a league with Mamercus, ruler of Catana, and they were supported by a body of Carthaginian auxiliaries sent to them by Gisco; but though they at first gained some partial successes, Hicetas was totally defeated by Timoleon at the river Damurias, and soon after fell into the hands of the enemy, by whom he was put to death, together with his son Eupolemus. His wife and daughters were carried to Syracuse, where they were executed, by order of the people, in vengeance for the fate of Arete and Aristomache. (Plut. Timol. 21, 24, 30‚Äî33; Diod. xvi. 72, 73, 81, 82.)

The Danube turn gives a good fortification locality and the region was royal domain during the √Årp√°d house kings of Hungary. The region was named Pilis forest. The royal palace and the neighbouring monastery played and important role in the life in the 11th century. Specifically, the life of B√©la I of Hungary ended here in 1063.

About the Award  The Rudolf Virchow Awards are given by the Critical Anthropology for Global Health Study Group, a special interest group of Society for Medical Anthropology. The professional award honors an article and the graduate and undergraduate student awards, a paper written in the spirit of Rudolf Virchow, that is deemed by the judges to best reflect, extend or advance critical perspectives in medical anthropology. These are materialist approaches that emphasize the social and political economic nature of health, disease and healing, and which embrace both micro and macro perspectives. Rudolf Virchow, a German physician writing during the 1800s, was a key founder of social medicine. In addition to writing in the areas of anthropology and medical science, his contributions to social medicine centered on his recognition of the multiple interacting factors, particularly social factors, that produce disease and illness. He argued that the difficult circumstances and deprivations of the working class increase susceptibility to disease as well as to higher mortality rates. Virchow also recognized the political and material circumstances that inhibited disease prevention efforts and viewed advocacy as an essential part of medical research. He was perhaps most articulate about the limitations of medical science to improving health in the absence of material security. Virchow viewed the state as responsible for providing that security through employment of those who could work. His appreciation for the complex relationship among health, medicine and society are remembered in his statement, ‚ÄúMedicine is a social science, and politics is nothing more than medicine in larger scale‚Äù.  Criteria and Eligibility  The professional award is given annually for an article, singly or co- authored, and published during the previous year in either a peer reviewed journal (either a print or on-line journal) or an edited volume. This prize will be given to professionals, or to graduate students who have singly or co- authored the published their work. The graduate student award will be granted to a paper that was written in the prize year or the preceding year and that has not been subjected to the process of editorial review. Papers that have been submitted to a journal or edited volume, but that have not yet benefited from review, may be included in this category. Theses and dissertations cannot be accepted. However, a summary of a thesis or a dissertation (no greater than about 30 pages) that can stand on its own, or a chapter that has been revised and can also stand on its own, will be considered for this award. Papers from students who have graduated after the paper was written will still be accepted under this category. Only papers, not interactive media, will be considered for this award. The undergraduate student award will be given to a paper that was written the prize year or the preceding year while the student was still an undergraduate. Theses will not be accepted. However, a shortened version (up to about 30 pages) of the thesis (or a chapter from the thesis) that has been revised to stand on its own will be considered for this award. Only papers, not interactive media, will be considered at this time.

It was made up of notables and artists of Antwerp who had visited Rome and offered artists access to the networks of Antwerp's urban elites.Rengenier C. Rittersma, Luxury in the Low Countries: Miscellaneous Reflections on Netherlandish Material Culture, 1500 to the Present, Asp / Vubpress / Upa, 2010, p. 111 History The Confr√©rie was established in 1572 in Antwerp's Cathedral of Our Lady under the patronage of St. Paul and St. Peter and was therefore also known as the 'Broederschap van de HH. Petrus en Paulus' (Confr√©rie of St. Peter and Paul). It was a condition of membership to have visited Rome. The condition of having visited Rome to enjoy membership appears to have been strictly enforced and art historians accept membership of the Confr√©rie as evidence of visits to Rome that are (in the case of Fyt etc.) otherwise undocumented. The membership included canons, prosperous merchants, members of the local nobility, aldermen and leading artists. Total membership was capped at 25 members, which accentuated the exclusive character of the society. Deans of the Confr√©rie were appointed annually. Saint Paul by Rubens After 1680 the Confr√©rie went into decline. The Confr√©rie moved in 1681 for financial reasons to Antwerp's St George's Church and remained dormant for a few decades. It was revived in 1716 when the 'true and approved' relics of St. Peter and Paul were delivered to St George's Church by a Roman cardinal. The Confr√©rie was finally abolished in 1785 under the rule of the Emperor Joseph II of Austria. A Magistrate Book (1576), the \\"LIBER CONFRATERNITATIS SANCTORUM PETRI ET PAULI EN ROMA' is kept in the State Archives.Antwerpen, Sint- Joriskerk ‚Äì De broederschappen actief in de kerk Centrum - Mechels Plein, 2000 Antwerpen, at the site of topa.be Significance The diversity of the membership offered artists a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons.Bert Timmermans. Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen: een elite als actor binnen een kunstwereld, Amsterdam University Press, Antwerp, 2008, pp. 243-245 A similar social mediation role was played by the chambers of rhetoric and in particular the Violieren, which was the chamber of rhetoric of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. Membership assisted artists further in raising their profile and prestige in society at large as well as among their fellow artists since only renowned artists were invited to join. The non-artist members relied on membership of the Confr√©rie to consolidate their social standing since many of the artist members enjoyed an international reputation. The social role of the Confr√©rie was facilitated through the institution of an annual gastronomic dinner (the '(h)eerlyck maeltyt'), with excellent wines and copious servings of food. The dinner was hosted at different locations. The Confr√©rie further allowed \\"'art-pilgrims' to keep themselves up to date on news from Rome, whether it be on new painters or paintings, or newly discovered antiquities\\".David Jaff√© (ed), Rubens, A Master in the Making, The National Gallery Company/Yale, p. 11 London 2005, Notable members *Marten de Vos - Founder *Jan Brueghel the Elder,1599Gregory Martin, The Flemish School, 1600-1900, National Gallery Catalogues, 1970, National Gallery, London, *Wenceslas Cobergher, 1605 *Otto van Veen, Dean 1606Grove Art online, accessed May 12, 2007 *Abraham Janssens, 1610 or 1601 *Hendrick van Balen, Dean 1613 *Peter Paul Rubens, 1609, Dean 1613-14 *Frans Snyders, 1619, Dean 1629Ingamells, John, The Wallace Collection, Catalogue of Pictures, Vol IV, Dutch and Flemish, Wallace Collection, 1992, *Jan Fyt, 1650, Dean 1652 *Abraham Godijn, joined in 1716 and was Dean in 1723Abraham Godijn at the Netherlands Institute for Art History See also * Romanism (painting) References Category:Art movements Category:History of Antwerp Category:Flemish painters Category:Defunct clubs and societies Category:Belgian artist groups and collectives ","title":"Guild of Romanists"},{"id":"11177996","text":"The controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) method, also called sea bed logging, is a mostly offshore geophysical technique,SIO Marine EM Laboratory employing electromagnetic remote-sensing technology to map the electric resistivity distribution of the subsurface.

It was named (after the Latin ablative feminine singular for \\"from a fixed date\\") by Howard Jacobson. The same system (including the same epoch) was used earlier, e.g., the REXX programming language since about 1980:REXX/400 Reference manual page 87. > The base date of 1 January 0001 is determined by extending the current > Gregorian calendar backward (365 days each year, with an extra day every > year that is divisible by 4 except century years that are not divisible by > 400). Rata Die is somewhat similar to Julian Dates (JD), in that the values are plain real numbers that increase by 1 each day. The systems differ principally in that JD takes on a particular value at a particular absolute time, and is the same in all contexts, whereas R.D. values may be relative to time zone, depending on the implementation. This makes R.D. more suitable for work on calendar dates, whereas JD is more suitable for work on time per se. The systems also differ trivially by having different epochs: R.D. is 1 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, JD is 0 at noon (12:00) Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BC in the proleptic Julian calendar, and the REXX count of days begins with 0 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. Forms =Dershowitz and Reingold= There are three distinct forms of R.D. In this section they will each be defined in terms of Julian Dates. The first form of R.D. is a continuously-increasing fractional number, taking integer values at midnight local time. It may be defined in terms of the Julian Date as :RD = JD ‚àí 1,721,424.5 In the second form, R.D. is an integer that labels an entire day, from midnight to midnight local time. This is the result of rounding the first form of R.D. downwards (towards negative infinity). It is the same as the relation between Julian Date and Julian Day Number (JDN). Thus: :RD = floor( JD ‚àí 1,721,424.5 ) In the third form, the R.D. is an integer labelling noon time, and incapable of labelling any other time of day. This is defined as :RD = JD ‚àí 1,721,425 where the R.D. value must be an integer, thus constraining the choice of JD. This form of R.D. is used in the book for conversion of calendar dates between calendars that separate days on different boundaries. The book does not explicitly distinguish between these three forms, using the abbreviation \\"R.D.\\" for all of them. The book does not say that the RD is based on Greenwich time, but page 10 states that an R.D. with a decimal fraction is called a moment, and the function moment- from-jd takes a floating point number as an argument and returns the argument -1721424.5; there is no requirement or opportunity to supply a time zone offset as an argument. =REXX= The DATE function of the REXX computer language can return the number of complete days (that is, not including the current day) since and including the base date, 1 January AD 1 Gregorian, if the \\"Base\\" option is specified. This function uses local, not Greenwich, time. REXX does not use the name \\"Rata Die\\".

C-UWB derives its bandwidth by virtue of the short time duration of the individual pulses. Information can be imparted (modulated) on UWB signals (pulses) by encoding the polarity of the pulse, the amplitude of the pulse, or by using orthogonal pulse shape modulation. Polarity modulation is analogous to BPSK in conventional RF technology. In orthogonal wave shape modulation, two orthogonal UWB pulse shapes are employed. These are further polarity modulated in a fashion analogous to QPSK in conventional radio technology. Preferably, the modulating data bits are scrambled or \\"whitened\\" to randomize the occurrences of ones and zeros. The pulses are sent contiguously as a continuous stream, hence the bit rate can equal the pulse rate. C-UWB systems were demonstrated in 2008 at channel pulse rates in excess of 1.3 giga-pulses per second, supporting forward error correction encoded data rates in excess of 675 Mbit/s. Continuous pulse UWB technology was the basis of one of the physical layers specified by the IEEE 802.15.4a standard.

Capricorni or Gliese 785) is a star in the southern constellation of Capricornus. It is located in the solar neighborhood at a distance of almost 29 light years, and is within the range of luminosity needed to be viewed from the Earth with the unaided eye. (According to the Bortle scale, it can be viewed from dark suburban skies.) HD 192310 is suspected of being a variable star, but this is unconfirmed.  Description  This is a K-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of K2+ V. HD 192310 has about 78% of the Sun's mass and, depending on the estimation method, 79% to 85% of the radius of the Sun. The effective temperature of the photosphere is about 5069 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star. It is older than the Sun, with age estimates in the range 7.5‚Äì8.9 billion years. The proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium, known as the metallicity, is similar to that of the Sun. It is spinning slowly, completing a rotation roughly every 48 days. The space velocity components of this star are (U, V, W) = . It is following an orbit through the Milky Way galaxy that has an orbital eccentricity of 0.18 at a mean galactocentric distance of 8.1 kpc. The star will achieve perihelion in around 82,200 years when it comes within of the Sun. Planetary system The system has a Neptune-mass planet \\"b\\", discovered in 2010. A second planet \\"c\\" was found in this system in 2011 by the HARPS GTO program, along with HD 85512 b and the planets of 82 G. Eridani. The uncertainty in the mass of the second planet is much higher than for the first because of the lack of coverage around the full orbit. Both planets may be similar in composition to Neptune. They are orbiting along the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone for this star.

Plot Poppo, a teenage girl, is raped by four boys on the roof of a seven-story apartment building. She asks them to kill her, but they mock her and leave. Tsukio, a teenage boy, has been watching the rape passively. Over the course of a day and a night, Poppo and Tsukio begin a relationship, telling each other of their troubled past and philosophizing about their fate. Poppo describes an earlier rapes shown in flashback. In a color flashback, Tsukio tells of his own recent sexual abuse at the hands of a neighboring foursome, all of whom he has stabbed to death. Poppo repeatedly asks Tsukio to kill her, but he refuses. When the gang returns and again rapes Poppo, Tsukio kills each of them and their three girlfriends. While he is doing this, Poppo follows him complaining that he refuses her request, yet is killing the gang. The story ends with Poppo and Tsukio both jumping off the apartment roof to their deaths.Synopsis based on , and Cast * Mimi Kozakura as Poppo * Michio Akiyama as Tsukio Background K≈çji Wakamatsu had worked for Nikkatsu studios between 1963 and 1965, and directed 20 exploitation films during that time. When his pink film (1965) ran afoul of the government, Wakamatsu quit Nikkatsu to form his own production company. His independent films of the late 1960s were very low- budget, but often artistically done works, usually concerned with sex and extreme violence mixed with political messages. Some critics have suggested that these films were an intentional provocation to the government, in order to generate free publicity resulting from censorship controversies. According to Patrick Macias, \\"No one had up to that point, or since, filmed porn with as overtly politically radical and aesthetically avant-garde an agenda as Wakamatsu had.\\" These films were usually produced for less than 1,000,000 yen (about $5,000), necessitating extreme cost-cutting measures including location shooting, single-takes, and natural lighting. Usually predominantly in black and white, Wakamatsu occasionally uses bursts of color in these films for theatrical effect. Like many of Wakamatsu's films of this period, Go, Go, Second Time Virgin is set mostly at one location‚Äîan apartment rooftop. It was shot in four days with a minimal budget. Themes and style Reviewer Donato Totaro calls the film an \\"alternating teenage expression of the sex (Eros) and death (Thanatos) drives, with sex continually made ugly and death the ultimate conqueror.\\" He further points out that Wakamatsu often puts moments in his films which appear to criticize the standard misogynistic tone of the Pink film genre. At one point in Go, Go, Second Time Virgin, Wakamatsu has Poppo look directly into the camera and address no character in the film, but the theatrical audience, saying, \\"My mother was gang raped, and then she gave birth to me. Are the tears we two shed when raped, the tears women shed? What tears? What sadness? I am not a woman. I‚Äôm not sad, not sad at all. I don‚Äôt cry. I‚Äôm never sad. I‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not at all sad‚Ä¶..FUCK YOU..FUCK YOU.\\" Patrick Macias says that writer Masao Adachi, along with Wakamatsu, is responsible for much of Go, Go, Second Time Virgins thematic, political and stylistic concerns. According to Macias, this film, like other Wakamatsu films of the time, \\"combined, in still unique manner, disjunctive New Wave style, existentialist dread, sex, sadism, and gore, all on a ridiculously shoestring budget.\\" David Desser compares the double-suicide with which the film concludes to the shinj≈´ (lover's suicide) in traditional Japanese theatrical forms such as bunraku and kabuki. He contrasts Poppo and Tsukio's nonchalant suicides with the michiyuki‚Äîthe dramatic, poetic final walk of the lovers‚Äîin the traditional theater.Desser, p.105. Desser also points out the interesting use of music in the film. At one point, Tsukio sings a song to his mother. American standards like Gershwin's \\"Summertime,\\" and the traditional spiritual \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\" as well as Patty Waters' avant-garde jazz arrangement of \\"Black Is The Color Of My True Love's Hair\\" are heard on the soundtrack.Desser, p.104. The psychoanalytic film-critic/theorist Pieter-Jan Van Haecke, sees the roof as \\"a metaphor for the societal plane ‚Äì a symbolic place that, with respect to dealing with youthful traumatized subjects, is but a failure\\". He argues that it is only by this metaphor that Go, Go second Time Virgin is able to become a societal critique on the very fact that Japanese society fails to help traumatized subjects find a less destructive way in life. Critical reception Though long relatively unknown outside Japan, K≈çji Wakamatsu has been called \\"the most important director to emerge in the pink film genre,\\"Desser, p.99. and one of \\"Japan's leading directors of the 1960s.\\"Sato, Tadao (translated by Gregory Barret). (1982). Currents in Japanese Cinema. Kodansha International Ltd. Tokyo. (), p.299. Go, Go, Second Time Virgin is one of Wakamatsu's best-known films, but discussion of it in English has been hampered by its long lack of availability to the English- speaking world. Compared to Wakamatsu's earlier films The Embryo Hunts in Secret and Violated Women in White, David Desser, writing in 1988, calls Go, Go, Second Time Virgin \\"by any standards a more interesting and less painful film to watch...\\" In 1998, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser, in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, gave the film a middling review which concludes, \\"Wakamatsu remains an interesting director due to his obstinate disregard for social standards. But unfortunately, he doesn't make the alternative, cultural anarchy, seem very appealing either.\\" With its release on region 1 DVD in December 2000, English-language criticism of Go, Go Second Time Virgin increased substantially. In his review of the DVD, Daniel Wible of Film Threat says Go, Go, Second Time Virgin is \\"clearly a film that will enthrall some with its ultra-stylized perversions while horrifying nearly everyone else.\\" He calls the movie \\"a serious and profound work of filmic art,\\" adding \\"[f]rom the experimental, jazzy score by Meikyu Sekai to the shocking use of color in a predominantly black and white film, \\"Go Go\\" is a director's film all the way. Wakamatsu gets away with his graphic images of sex and violence because they are staged in ways that resonate emotionally for both the characters and the audience. Totaro points out that in spite of the limited budget and location, \\"Wakamatsu sacrifices little in terms of aesthetics, using both the location and the cinemascope frame to increase the character‚Äôs psychological expression.\\" Though warning that \\"[t]he relentless, downbeat atmosphere will prove tough going for many viewers,\\" Mondo-Digital website says the film \\"packs a tremendous amount of artistry into every scene.\\" Sarudama.com's review of the film calls it \\"a rather dismal tale of primitive morality in the face of degradation, humiliation and abuse,\\" and \\"a bizarre and despairing film which will undoubtedly cause viewers to (re)consider the role of social morality.\\" The New Zealand band The Headless Chickens also recorded a song named after and loosely based on this film.

History The burlesque lament on the death of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650‚Äì1722) was written on a false rumour of that event after the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709, the bloodiest battle of the War of the Spanish Succession. It tells how Marlborough's wife, awaiting his return from battle, is given the news of her husband's death. It also tells that he was buried and that a nightingale sang over his grave. For years it was only known traditionally, and does not appear among the many anecdotic songs printed in France during the middle of the 18th century. Beaumarchais used the tune in his 1778 play The Marriage of Figaro for a despairing love song for Cherubino. In 1780 it became very popular. For instance, the tune concludes a sonata (in D-major) for viola d'amore and viola composed by Carl Stamitz in 1780 while in Paris. And it happened that when Louis XVII of France was born in 1785 (son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette and heir to the French throne) he was wet-nursed by a peasant named Genevi√®ve Poitrine. The nurse, whilst rocking the royal cradle, sang \\"Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre\\" and The name, the simplicity of the words, and the melodiousness of the tune, interested the queen, and she frequently sang it. Everybody repeated it after her, including the king. The song was sung in the state apartments of Versailles, in the kitchens and in the stables ‚Äì it became immensely popular.Le Petit-Trianon et Marie-Antoinette, √âditions T√©l√©maque, by √âlisabeth Reynaud, April 2010, page 288, Antiwar Songs (AWS) - Malbrough s'en va-t-en guerre. From the court it was adopted by the tradespeople of Paris, and it passed from town to town, and country to country. It became as popular in England as in France. Johann von Goethe came to hate Marlborough simply on account of the prevalence of the tune he encountered during travels in France. It also became popular in Spain due to the Bourbon dynasty's influence on Spanish nobility. The name of Marlborough was modified to an easier to pronounce Mambr√∫. It was sung by children while playing Hopscotch (Rayuela). The Spanish guitarist and composer Fernando Sor (1778‚Äì1839) created a series of variations for guitar on the theme. It then spread to Latin America. The rage endured for many years, slowly fading after the French Revolution, although, it is said that Napoleon liked to hum the tune, for instance when crossing the Memel (June 1812) at the beginning of his fatal Russian campaign.

Goethe references the song in his Zweite Elegiehttps://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Elegien_(Goethe). In Zweiter Brief aus Berlin http://germazope.uni- trier.de:8080/Projekte/HHP/werke/baende/D06/index_html?widthgiven=30, DHA, Bd.6, S.21 (1822) Heinrich Heine uses the song as prime example of a catchy tune which one cannot excape. His story describes the ubiquity of the tune Der Jungfern-Kranz from Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz. In present-day Germany the allusion needs explanation. The song is referenced in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment, where Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladova tries to make her children sing the popular Russian version in public shortly before her death. The song is referenced in Leo Tolstoy's novel War and Peace, where Prince Nikolai Bolkonsky sings the first verse of the song to his son Prince Andrei after hearing Russia's military strategy (Part One, chapter XXIII). The song is referenced in Nikolai Gogol's novel Dead Souls, when Major Nozdryov's playing of the mazurka devolves into the common tune in Chapter 4. The song is referenced in Patrick O'Brian's novel The Fortune of War in chapter 8 when Captain Jack Aubrey hears it being sung by French soldiers in a bar in a hotel from which Aubrey helps Stephen Maturin and Diana Villiers escape. The song is referenced in Vladimir Nabokov‚Äôs novel Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle, in chapter 40; Blanche hums it while Lucette and Ada, observed by Van, practice drawing flowers in one of the ‚Äúnursery parlors.‚Äù Argentinan poet and author Mar√≠a Elena Walsh makes Marlborough, or Mambr√∫ in the Spanish version, the main character in her 1962 song \\"Canci√≥n del estornudo\\" (Sneeze's song). An operetta produced in Paris in December 1867 with Suzanne Lagier borrowed the title of the song. One act each was written by Georges Bizet, L√©o Delibes, √âmile Jonas and isidore Legouix (see Classical music written in collaboration). In pop culture it is sung by Rasputine in Hugo Pratt's comic The Golden House of Samarkand, part of the Corto Maltese series, first issued in 1980 (French and Italian version). The melody also became widely popular in the United Kingdom.The Times (London, England), 28 March 1826, p. 2: \\"The Power of Music. A visiting foreigner, trying to recall the address of his lodgings in Marlborough Street, hums the tune to a London cabman: he immediately recognises it as 'Malbrook'.\\" By the mid-19th centuryThe song may have featured in an \\"extravaganza\\" given at the Princess theatre in London at Easter 1846, during which fairies hold a moonlight meeting: \\"...the meeting closes with a song of thanks to Robin Goodfellow (Miss Marshall), who had occupied the chair,...and who is assured that \\"he's a jolly good fellow.\\" \\"Princess's.\\" The Times [London, England] 14 Apr. 1846: 5. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 1 October 2012. it was being sung with the words \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\", often at all-male social gatherings.The Times reprinted an article from Punch describing a drunken speech given at a (fictional) public meeting. The speech ends: \\"Zshenl'men, here's all your vehgood healts!

By 1862, it was already familiar in America.Review of a piano recital: \\"As a finale he performed for the first time, a burlesque on the French air, 'Marlbrook', better known to the American student of harmony as \\"He's a jolly good fellow\\". The New York Times, 4 October 1862 The song has been translated into several languages, including an English version written by the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in the 19th century. The Swedish version, \\"Mellbom\\", is in certain academic circumstances (mainly at √ñstg√∂ta Nation) traditionally combined with a humoristic pantomime describing the plot. Traditionally the fourth officer in the funeral parade, the one who was \\"left nothing to carry\\", performs in the nude. The Mellbom pantomime was invented by M√•ns Hultin, a member of √ñstg√∂ta Nation, 1856. Due to the large number of female students at the present day Nation, Mellbom shows have grown rare during the last 20 years.

It lies west of Tata and north-west of Budapest. History Kocs is best known internationally as giving rise to the English word coach and its equivalents in nearly all European languages, for example: Czech koƒç√°r, Slovak koƒç, German Kutsche, Dutch koets, Catalan cotxe, Italian cocchio, Spanish, Portuguese, and French coche, Scandinavian kusk. During the reign of King Matthias Corvinus in the 15th century, the wheelwrights of Kocs began to build a horse-drawn vehicle with steel-spring suspension. This \\"cart of Kocs\\" as the Hungarians called it (kocsi szek√©r) soon became popular all over Europe. The spread of the kocsi szek√©r has been linked by some theories personally to the king of Hungary Ferdinand I, the younger brother of Charles V who became the king of Spain, Emperor of Germany, and lord of the Burgundian Netherlands, in the 16th century, and who promoted the comfortable, spring-suspended wagons among the wealthy European nobility. A 16th-century German depiction of a kocsi without springs puts this theory in doubt, however, and it is uncertain whether the springs or some other feature were responsible for the spread of the word throughout Europe.\\"coach\\": The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989.

In contemporary colloquial Hungarian the word \\"kocsi\\" is most often used to mean \\"car\\". The coat of arms of the town, in addition to displaying a ram and the √Årp√°d stripes, also depicts an early model cart or wagon that refers to the wheelwrights' successful industry.

It is located on Via XX September, 86. The museum, whose first directors were Roberto and Massimo d'Azeglio, unites the art collection of Eugene of Savoy, acquired after his death by his cousin, the king of Sardinia, with the works from the Royal Palace of Turin, the picture gallery of the Savoy-Carignano, and the artworks from the Palazzo Durazzo of Genoa, acquired in 1824. On October 2, 1832 (his birthday), King Charles Albert of Savoy inaugurated the royal gallery at the Palazzo Madama, containing 365 paintings. In 1865, Massimo d'Azeglio had the collection transferred to Guarino Guarini's Palazzo dell'Accademia delle Scienze (1679) where it stood until 2012, before it was moved to the current location. On December 4, 2014, at the presence of the Italian Minister of Culture, the \\"Manica Nuova\\" of Palazzo Reale (New Wing of the Royal Palace) was official opened. The collection has now found its final place to be exhibited. The gallery is based on a brand new museum project conceived and developed by the superintendent Edith Gabrielli (for the scientific part) together with Studio Albini Associati (staging). The lighting is by CastagnaRavelli Studio, based in Milan, the graphic is by Noorda Design. Unfortunately, the second floor galleries - half the collection, including many Dutch paintings - are often closed, for weeks or months at a time, apparently for lack of staff, without this information being published anywhere. Collection The collection includes works by Netherlandish artists such as Gerrit Dou, Jan van Eyck (side panels of the Annunciation Triptych), Jan van Huchtenburg, Hans Memling (Scenes from the Passion of Christ), Rembrandt, and Anthony van Dyck (Portrait of the Three Eldest Children of Charles I), as well as paintings by Italian artists such as Duccio di Buoninsegna (Gualino Madonna), Macrino d'Alba, Sandro Botticelli, Filippino Lippi (Three Angels and Young Tobias), Bernardo Daddi, Fra Angelico, Piero del Pollaiolo, Agnolo Bronzino, Bernardo Bellotto, Giovanni Canavesio, Orazio Gentileschi (Annunciation), Andrea Mantegna, Girolamo Savoldo, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Gaudenzio and Defendente Ferrari, Giovanni Bellini, Guercino, Francesco Cairo, Sebastiano Ricci, Giovanni Martino Spanzotti, Titian, Paolo Veronese, and Tintoretto, and the Frenchman Pierre Subleyras.

This results in breaks or interruptions in the voice, often every few sentences, which can make a person difficult to understand. The person's voice may also sound strained or they may be nearly unable to speak. Onset is often gradual and the condition is lifelong. The cause is unknown. Risk factors may include family history. Triggers may include an upper respiratory infection, injury to the larynx, overuse of the voice, and psychological stress. The underlying mechanism is believed to typically involve the central nervous system, specifically the basal ganglia. Diagnosis is typically made following examination by a team of healthcare providers. It is a type of focal dystonia. While there is no cure, treatment may improve symptoms. Most commonly this involves injecting botulinum toxin into the affected muscles of the larynx. This generally results in improvement for a few months. Other measures include voice therapy, counselling, and amplification devices. If this is not effective, surgery may be considered; however, evidence to support surgery is limited. The disorder affects an estimated 2 per 100,000 people. Women are more commonly affected. Onset is typically between the ages of 30 and 50. Severity is variable between people. In some, work and social life are affected. Life expectancy is, however, normal.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia can come on suddenly or gradually appear over the span of years. They can come and go for hours or even weeks at a time, or remain consistent. Gradual onset can begin with the manifestation of a hoarse voice quality, which may later transform into a voice quality described as strained with breaks in phonation.Colton, R. H., & Casper, J. K. (2006). Understanding voice problems: A physiological perspective for diagnosis and treatment. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. These phonation breaks have been compared to stuttering in the past, but there is a lack of research in support of spasmodic dysphonia being classified as a fluency disorder. It is commonly reported by people with spasmodic dysphonia that symptoms almost only occur on vocal sounds that require phonation. Symptoms are less likely to occur at rest, while whispering, or on speech sounds that do not require phonation. It is hypothesized this occurs because of an increase in sporadic, sudden, and prolonged tension found in the muscles around the larynx during phonation. This tension affects the abduction and adduction (opening and closing) of the vocal folds. Consequently, the vocal folds are unable to retain subglottal air pressure (required for phonation) and breaks in phonation can be heard throughout the speech of people with spasmodic dysphonia. Regarding types of spasmodic dysphonia, the main characteristic of spasmodic dysphonia, breaks in phonation, is found along with other varying symptoms. The voice quality of adductor spasmodic dysphonia can be described as ‚Äústrained-strangled‚Äù from tension in the glottal region. Voice quality for abductor spasmodic dysphonia can be described as breathy from variable widening of the glottal region. Vocal tremor may also be seen in spasmodic dysphonia. A mix and variance of these symptoms are found in mixed spasmodic dysphonia. Symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia typically appear in middle aged people, but have also been seen in people in their twenties, with symptoms emerging as young as teenage years.  Cause  Normal functioning vocal folds Although the exact cause of spasmodic dysphonia is still unknown, epidemiological, genetic, and neurological pathogenic factors have been proposed in recent research. Risk factors include: * Being female * Being middle aged * Having a family history of neurological diseases (e.g., tremor, dystonia, meningitis, and other neurological diseases) * Stressful events * Upper respiratory tract infections * Sinus and throat illnesses * Heavy voice use * Cervical dystonia * Childhood measles or mumps * Pregnancy and parturition It has not been established whether these factors directly affect the development of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), however these factors could be used to identify possible and/or at-risk patients. Researchers have also explored the possibility of a genetic component to SD. Three genes have been identified that may be related to the development of focal or segmental dystonia: TUBB4A, THAP1 and TOR1A genes. However, a recent study that examined the mutation of these three genes in 86 SD patients found that only 2.3% of the patients had novel/rare variants in THAP1 but none in TUBB4A and TOR1A. Evidence of a genetic contribution for dystonia involving the larynx is still weak and more research is needed in order to establish a causal relationship between SD and specific genes. SD is a neurological disorder rather than a disorder of the larynx, and as in other forms of dystonia, interventions at the end organ (i.e., larynx) have not offered a definitive cure, only symptomatic relief. The pathophysiology underlying dystonia is becoming better understood as a result of discoveries about genetically based forms of the disorder, and this approach is the most promising avenue to a long-term solution. SD is classified as a neurological disorder.Dystonias Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) However, because the voice can sound normal or near normal at times, some practitioners believe it to be psychogenic; that is, originating in the affected person's mind rather than from a physical cause. This was especially true in the 19th and 20th centuries. No medical organizations or groups take this position. A comparison of SD patients compared with vocal fold paralysis (VFP) patients found that 41.7% of the SD patients met the DSM-IV criteria for psychiatric comorbidity compared with 19.5% of the VFP group. However, another study found the opposite, with SD patients having significantly less psychiatric comorbidity compared to VFP patients: \\"The prevalence of major psychiatric cases varied considerably among the groups, from a low of seven percent (1/14) for spasmodic dysphonia, to 29.4 percent (5/17) for functional dysphonia, to a high of 63.6 percent (7/11) for vocal cord paralysis.\\"Newswise Medical News  Patients with Selected Voice Disorders Are Subject to Psychiatric Problems A review in the journal Swiss Medicine Weekly states that \\"Psychogenic causes, a 'psychological disequilibrium', and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder\\". Alternatively, many investigators into the condition feel that the psychiatric comorbidity associated with voice disorders is a result of the social isolation and anxiety that patients with these conditions feel as a consequence of their difficulty with speech, as opposed to the cause of their dysphonia.Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol. 2001 Oct;110(10):941‚Äì5. The opinion that SD is psychogenic is not upheld by experts in the scientific community.Spasmodic Dysphonia is a Neurological Disorder Current Evidence and References , by Christy L. Ludlow, Ph.D. SD is formally classified as a movement disorder; it is a type of focal dystonia known as laryngeal dystonia.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia requires a multidisciplinary team and consideration of both perceptual and physiological factors. There is currently no universally accepted diagnostic test for spasmodic dysphonia, which presents a challenge for diagnosis. Additionally, diagnostic criteria have not been agreed upon as the distinguishing features of this disorder have not been well-characterized. A team of professionals including a speech-language pathologist, an otolaryngologist, and a neurologist, are typically involved in spasmodic dysphonia assessment and diagnosis. The speech-language pathologist conducts a speech assessment including case history questions to gather information about voice use and symptoms. This is followed by clinical observation and perceptual rating of voice characteristics such as voice breaks or strain, which are selectively present in normal speech over other voice activities such as whispering or laughing. Symptoms also vary across types of spasmodic dysphonia. For example, voiced sounds are more affected in adductor spasmodic dysphonia, while unvoiced sounds are more affected in abductor spasmodic dysphonia. Following speech assessment, the otolaryngologist conducts a flexible transnasal laryngoscopy to view the vocal folds and activity of the muscles controlling them in order to eliminate other possible causes of the voice disorder. In spasmodic dysphonia, producing long vowels or speaking sentences results in muscle spasms which are not observed during other vocal activities such as coughing, breathing, or whispering. To evaluate the individual for any other neurological problems, this examination is followed up with an assessment by the neurologist. =Voice quality symbol= The voice quality symbol for spasmodic dysphonia is Íüø. = Differential diagnosis = Because spasmodic dysphonia shares many characteristics with other voice disorders, misdiagnosis frequently occurs. A common misdiagnosis is muscle tension dysphonia, a functional voice disorder which results from use of the voice, rather than a structural abnormality. Some parameters can help guide the clinician towards a decision. In muscle tension dysphonia, the vocal folds are typically hyperadducted in constant way, not in a spasmodic way. Additionally, the voice difficulties found in spasmodic dysphonia can be task specific, as opposed to those found in muscle tension dysphonia. Being able to differentiate between muscle tension dysphonia and spasmodic dysphonia is important because muscle tension dysphonia typically responds well to behavioural voice treatment but spasmodic dysphonia does not. This is crucial to avoid providing inappropriate treatment, but in some cases a trial of behavioural voice treatment can also be helpful to establish a differential diagnosis. Spasmodic dysphonia can also be misdiagnosed as voice tremor. The movements that are found in this disorder are typically rhythmic in nature, as opposed to the muscle spasms of spasmodic dysphonia. It is important to note that voice tremor and spasmodic dysphonia can co-occur in some patients. Differential diagnosis is particularly important for determining appropriate interventions, as the type and cause of the disorder determine the most effective treatment. Differences in treatment effectiveness are present even between the types of spasmodic dysphonia. Diagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia is often delayed due to these challenges, which in turn presents difficulties in choosing the proper interventions. = Types = The three types of spasmodic dysphonia (SD) are adductor spasmodic dysphonia, abductor spasmodic dysphonia, and mixed spasmodic dysphonia. A fourth type called whispering dysphonia has also been proposed. Adductor spasmodic dysphonia is the most common type.  Adductor spasmodic dysphonia  Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) is the most common type, affecting around 87% of individuals with SD. In ADSD, sudden involuntary muscle movements or spasms cause the vocal folds (or vocal cords) to squeeze together and stiffen. As the name suggests, these spasms occur in the adductor muscles of the vocal folds, specifically the thyroarytenoid and the lateral cricoarytenoid. These spasms make it difficult for the vocal folds to vibrate and produce voice. Words are often cut off or are difficult to start because of the muscle spasms. Therefore, speech may be choppy but differs from stuttering. The voice of an individual with adductor spasmodic dysphonia is commonly described as strained or strangled and full of effort. Surprisingly, the spasms are usually absent while laughing, speaking at a high pitch, or speaking while singing, but singers can experience a loss of range or the inability to produce certain notes of a scale or with projection. Stress, however, often makes the muscle spasms more severe.Includes text taken directly from the website. As a work of the National Institutes of Health, part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, this text constitutes a work of the U.S. federal government, therefore it is in the public domain.  Abductor spasmodic dysphonia  Abductor spasmodic dysphonia (ABSD) is the second most common type, affecting around 13% of individuals with SD. In ABSD, sudden involuntary muscle movements or spasms cause the vocal folds to open. As the name suggests, these spasms occur in the single abductor muscle of the vocal folds, called the posterior cricoarytenoid. The vocal folds cannot vibrate when they are open. The open position of the vocal folds also allows air to escape from the lungs during speech. As a result, the voices of these individuals often sound weak, quiet, and breathy or whispery. As with adductor spasmodic dysphonia, the spasms are often absent during activities such as laughing or singing, but singers can experience a loss of range or the inability to produce certain notes of a scale or with projection.  Mixed spasmodic dysphonia  Mixed spasmodic dysphonia is the most rare type. Mixed spasmodic dysphonia involves both muscles that open the vocal folds and those that close them and therefore has features of both adductor and abductor spasmodic dysphonia. Some researchers believe that a subset of cases classified as mixed spasmodic dysphonia may actually be ADSD or ABSD subtype with the addition of compensatory voice behaviours that make it appear mixed. This further adds to the difficulty in achieving accurate diagnosis. Whispering dysphonia A fourth type has also been described. This appears to be caused by mutations in the TUBB4 gene on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.2-p13.3). This gene encodes a tubulin gene. The pathophysiology of this condition has yet to be determined.  Treatment  There are a number of potential treatments for spasmodic dysphonia, including Botox, voice therapy, and surgery. A number of medications have also been tried including anticholinergics (such as benztropine) which have been found to be effective in 40-50% of people, but which are associated with a number of side effects. = Botulinum toxin = Botulinum toxin (Botox) is often used to improve some symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia through weakening or paralyzing the vocal folds, thus preventing muscle spasms. The level of evidence for its use is currently limited; little is known about optimal dosage, frequency of injections, or exact location of injection. However, it remains a choice for many people due to the predictability and low chance of long term side effects. It results in periods of some improvement, with the duration of benefit lasting for 10‚Äì12 weeks on average before symptoms return to baseline. Repeat injection is required to sustain good vocal production, as results are only temporary. Some transient side effects observed in adductor spasmodic dysphonia include reduced speaking volume, difficulty swallowing, and a breathy and hoarse voice quality. While treatment outcomes are generally positive, it is presently unclear whether this treatment approach is more or less effective than others. = Voice therapy = Voice therapy appears to be ineffective in cases of true spasmodic dysphonia, however as it is difficult to distinguish between spasmodic dysphonia and functional dysphonias, and misdiagnosis is relatively common, trial of voice therapy is often recommended before more invasive procedures are tried. Some also state that it is useful for mild symptoms and as an add- on to botox therapy and others report success in more severe cases. Laryngeal manual therapy, which is massaging of the neck and cervical structures, also shows positive results for intervention of functional dysphonia. = Surgery = If other measures are not effective, surgery may be considered; however, evidence to support surgery as a treatment for SD is limited. Treatment outcomes are generally positive, though more research is required to determine its effectiveness. Post-surgery voices can be imperfect and about 15% of people have significant difficulties. If symptoms do recur, this typically happens in the first 12 months. As of 2011, surgery was rarely used as a treatment approach for SD. Surgical approaches include recurrent laryngeal nerve resection, selective laryngeal adductor denervation-reinnervation (SLAD-R), thyroplasty, thyroarytenoid myectomy, and laryngeal nerve crush. Recurrent laryngeal nerve resection involves removing a section of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Recurrent laryngeal nerve avulsion is a more drastic removal of sections of the nerve, and has positive outcomes of 80% at three years. SLAD-R is effective specifically for adductor spasmodic dysphonia, for which it has shown good outcomes in about 80% of people at 8 years. Thyroplasty changes the position or length of the vocal folds. History Initial surgical efforts to treat the condition were published in 1976 by Herbert Dedo and involved cutting of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Some think the name may be a corruption of the later part of the Latin name Ma-ximinus, as there are late Classic records that various individuals with this name were becoming very active as officials and residents in upper Hispania near the Pyrenees and Tarraconensis during the last century of the Western Roman Empire, and perhaps into the period of transition from imperial province to independent Kingdom during Visigothic rule. A \\"Seguin\\" was attested in Frankish chronicles when referring to the Count of Bordeaux and Duke of Vasconia (778, 814 and 816). The name is also recorded as Sihiminus, perhaps a rendering of Ximinus. He may have been a local Basque whose family later fled south over the Pyrenees and helped Enneco Arista take over in Pamplona. Arab sources in Al-Andalus report in 778 a \\"Jimeno, the strong\\", calling him \\"Mothmin al-Akra\\".

He is also a business speaker and founder of Music & Management. Early life Alldis was born into a family of classical musicians. His mother was a violinist and his father was choral conductor John Alldis. He was exposed early to classical repertoire, studying classical cello, piano, and organ, then conducting and composition. Career Alldis began his musical career in 1982 in Paris, studying jazz piano with Bernard Maury and Aaron Bridgers, while accompanying singers of French chanson and teaching at the American School of Modern Music. In 1984, he returned to the UK to become resident-pianist at the London jazz and cabaret venue, Pizza on the Park. During a two-year residency he played opposite many celebrated jazz and cabaret artists including Blossom Dearie, Steve Ross, Dave Frishberg, Bob Dorough, Teddy Wilson, Dave McKenna and Roger Kellaway. In 1987‚Äì89, Alldis studied composition with Konrad Boehmer and Frederic Rzewski at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. In 1988 he was invited by the Studio for Electro- Instrumental Music in Amsterdam (STEIM) to develop a performance using live electronics and the Yamaha MIDI Grand Piano. He then toured Europe during 1989‚Äì91 giving concerts using the new instrument, culminating in the album Night Music for Lumina Records. In 1996 he started the record label Canzona Music and recorded a series of vocal-jazz albums: Turn Out the Stars ‚Äì the songs of Bill Evans, If Love Were All ‚Äì the songs of No√´l Coward and Watch What Happens ‚Äì the songs of Michel Legrand. These albums feature the UK jazz musicians Claire Martin (vocals), Geoff Gascoyne (bass), Adam Glasser (harmonica), Tim Garland (saxophone), Alec Dankworth (bass), Clark Tracey (drums), Colin Oxley (guitar), Iain Ballamy (saxophone) and Martin France (drums) and classical quartets The Allegri Quartet and The Pavao Quartet. All albums on Canzona Music are distributed by State51. In 2002 he formed an octet comprising four jazz soloists and a classical string quartet: Iain Ballamy (saxophone), Malcolm Creese (bass), Martin France (drums) and the Pavao Quartet. Together they undertook a UK tour sponsored by the Arts Council of England in a programme of Alldis's contemporary arrangements of themes from classic French films, such as A Man and a Woman, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Monsieur Hulot's Holiday, as well as songs by film composer Michel Legrand. Concert venues included the Wigmore Hall (London), the Adrian Boult Hall (Birmingham) and the Queen's Hall, Edinburgh. This led to a fourth album on the Canzona Music label: Themes from French Cinema. This was followed in 2008 by the release of Scenes We Once Knew, an album of works by jazz-singer pianists, and in 2009 Songs We Heard featuring contemporary arrangements of familiar childhood songs for jazz piano trio. Alldis formed the Dominic Alldis Trio in 2009 with former Ronnie Scott's Quintet bassist Andrew Cleyndert and drummer Martin France. The trio brings a jazz approach to their repertoire, including classical themes from chamber music and opera, folk songs and childhood themes, as well as original compositions. Key influences include Bill Evans, Jacques Loussier, Jan Johansson, John Lewis and the Modern Jazz Quartet. The Trio's album, A Childhood Suite features improvisations on familiar childhood themes scored for piano trio and string orchestra. In 2010 Alldis founded the Canzona Chamber Orchestra to perform classical repertoire and crossover projects with jazz musicians. Their inaugural concert was at St James's Church, Piccadilly, London on 22 April 2010, and featured Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings, Britten's Simple Symphony and the premiere of Alldis's Childhood Suite, scored for jazz piano trio and orchestra. Teaching and writing Alldis has taught at music institutions in London, Dartington and Paris, and is on the staff at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London, where he teaches improvisation to classical pianists and opera singers. In 2006, he led a jazz singing masterclass at the RAM. He wrote A Classical Approach to Jazz Piano Harmony and A Classical Approach to Jazz Piano Improvisation, both published by the Hal Leonard Corporation. In 1998, he founded Music & Management, which offers corporate training and client appreciation events exploring the parallels between musical and business leadership. His events often involve a live symphony orchestra or jazz band, or a solo piano performance.

A multitude of ‚Äòlishes‚Äô: The nomenclature of hybridity. English World-wide, 39(1): 31. DOI: 10.1075/eww.38.3.04lam Influence of indigenous languages The speech patterns of Ugandan languages strongly influence spoken English. Uganda has a large variety of indigenous languages, and someone familiar with Uganda can readily identify the native language of a person speaking English. Ugandan speakers will alter foreign words to make them sound more euphonic. The Bantu languages spoken in southern Uganda tend not to have consonants sounded alone without a vowel in the syllable. Indeed, the Luganda word for consonant is \\"silent letter\\". Thus the letters l and d in Alfred will be given sound by the addition of , making the pronunciation of the word . Similarly, muscular is pronounced . Luganda never has an starting a word; it only appears following the letters and within a word. The sound, conversely, cannot follow these sounds. Thus the word railway gets its and its substituted, giving . Luganda does not permit the sequence ; any occurrence of this sound becomes . Thus cute is pronounced . The initial is dysphonic to the Luganda speaker but is perfectly natural to the speaker of Runyankole and Rukiga, which have few instances of the sound. Additionally, in Runyankole and Rukiga is more often heard as . The combination of the above three rules will transform calcium into . Vocabulary and idioms Some Ugandan English words have a peculiar meaning widely understood within Uganda but mystifying to foreigners. The origin of these usages may be obscure. The best known example is probably to extend, which in Uganda means move over on a seat to make room for someone else. Another example, \\"pop\\", is used to replace words like bring and come for example: Danny, pop that bottle here or Heno, pop to my house. =Terms for buildings= Sometimes the usage has a traceable origin. A basement is called a godown, but the usual meaning of warehouse is also known in Uganda as proper English. A building labelled hotel, in a small town, is likely to be a restaurant. =Terms for clothing= The verb to put on is often substituted for to dress, to be dressed, or to wear. One may hear remarks such as \\"That lady is rich, don't you see how she is putting on\\" and \\"The police are looking for a man putting on a red shirt.\\" =Terms for communication= Mobile phone services are prepaid. A person finding himself with inadequate prepaid time to make a call will ring up the intended recipient of the call and hang up immediately. The receiver of the call, hearing the phone ring once and seeing the number, understands himself to have been beeped. Alternatively, it is called being flashed on account of the brief flashing of the screen. The understood message is I wish to talk to you at your expense. =Terms for education and training= In the worlds of business and development, the word \\"facilitation\\" or the expression \\"to facilitate someone\\" have fundamentally different meanings in Uganda from those in Europe or the US. In Uganda, it most often means paying them for something. It is often a payment in part to cover some expenses, but is expected to go beyond just the \\"out-of-pocket\\" costs the recipient has incurred. Sometimes it can amount to the equivalent of a week or two's wages just for attending a meeting for a day or two. In business in Europe or the US, it usually means to help organise progress amongst a group of people in some way and almost never involves paying them anything. This is rather about helping them by doing preparation and analysis; by chairing and minute-taking at meetings and by mobilising, coaching and advising. =Terms for family members= Children whose fathers are brothers are considered siblings in most Ugandan tribes. The English word cousin conflates them with the children of a maternal uncle or those of aunts, who in a patrilineal society belong to a different clan. Thus, the terms cousin brother or cousin sister are used to identify the \\"close\\" cousins. A dependant is a child who is not the biological offspring of the family with whom the child lives. Sometimes, dependants are referred to as sons, daughters, nephews, or nieces. The high number of children orphaned by AIDS and poverty combined with the communal culture of Uganda leads to an extremely high number of dependents and a great deal of confusion for an outsider trying to determine biological family structure. =Terms for food and farming= Drinking a beverage is often described as taking a beverage. A daso is a soda. Dry tea or chai just means tea. Food refers to starches only, not chips (french fries), which are snacks. Meat refers to beef, goat meat and sometimes pork, not chicken or fish. Macrones means spaghetti, which is generally fried in oil. Irish means (Irish) potatoes, while \\"potatoes\\" means sweet potatoes. Pawpaw or popo means papaya. Sukuma wiki means collard greens. Ovacado or Vacado means avocado. Posho refers to a dense mixture of cooked cornmeal and water also known as ugali. Farming is often referred to as digging and fields under cultivation, even large ones, may be referred to as gardens.Max Levental. Peace Corps Uganda 2011-2013 =Terms for language= The word vernacular, rarely used in ordinary conversation in most of the English speaking world, is common in Uganda to mean local language. It comes from the fact that in most primary schools, pupils are punished for speaking \\"vernacular\\", languages other than English. Since there are many local languages, they are usually classified as \\"vernacular\\". =Terms for money= When money is spent extravagantly on outings, shopping, recreations and the like, Ugandans are said to be \\"eating money.\\" It is also a common phrase in reference to embezzlement, corruption, or misappropriation of funds: \\"The Minister ate the money,\\" or \\"He was fired from his job because he ate money.\\" This phrase also applies to living a lavish or abundant lifestyle, hence \\"You are eating money,\\" which commonly means one is successful and doing well. In Uganda the verb \\"demand\\" is often used instead of \\"owe\\", with inversion of subject and object. For example, I demand John ten thousand shillings meaning John owes me ten thousand shillings. When out with friends to drink or shopping and someone takes the bill, the term House is used. For example, We went out with Kenneth last night and he housed us meaning We went out with Kenneth last night and he paid for the drinks Foreign currency is forex, and currency exchange bureaus are forex bureaux. In American and British English, a dishonoured check is said to bounce; Ugandans have adopted this phrase to refer to the inability to the failure to meet with someone ‚Äî with or without an appointment: \\"I came to your place and bounced.\\" =Terms for quality= Somehow is interspersed frequently, and means slightly, occasionally, or can imply doubt. When asked if you liked the food, and you enjoyed it slightly, you could simply reply 'somehow'. The word fake can be used to chastise a person about something. For example, if one's friend went on an exciting evening out without inviting the other friend, one might hear the latter complain, saying \\"Eeh, you man, you are fake!\\" =Terms for religion= A save-dee is someone who has found God, often referred to in other English- speaking countries as being saved. Individuals who would be referred to elsewhere as atheists and agnostics are referred to as pagans. =Words for social events and greetings= Congs is frequently used as shortening of congratulations. Wel be back is a bastardised way of saying welcome back, but it used much more commonly. The word lost is used to mean that one has not seen the person in a long time. One would say \\"Eeeh, but you are lost.\\" The phrase \\"ok please\\" is used to convey agreement or acknowledgement. It can also be used to signal a transition. For instance, if a person is preparing to leave, he might break a moment of silence with \\"ok please\\" and then announce that he is leaving. \\"Thank you please\\" has a similar meaning, but can also mean thank you. \\"Please\\" never means please. If Ugandans want something, they say \\"You give me...\\" Please is not required; the tone of the voice is normally enough to convey politeness. =Terms for transport and giving directions= Forms of transport are referred to as means. For instance: 'I could not reach the party last night; I had no means'. A \\"taxi\\" is a van used like a bus, carrying many persons along a fixed route. A taxi taking one passenger at a time on a negotiable route is referred to as a special hire. A tow truck is a breakdown. A motorbike or bicycle used for the same purpose is a bodaboda. The term originated at the Uganda‚ÄìKenya border crossing at Busia, where a kilometre separates the downtown area from the border post on the Ugandan side. Travellers dropped off at the bus/taxi station by buses or taxis, or those coming to Uganda from the Kenya side, were ferried over this distance by enterprising cyclists, who would attract business by calling \\"border, border\\". The title Captain is applied to all pilots, not just those in command of a plane. Pilot is often used to refer to the driver of a bus, (minivan) taxi or \\"special hire\\". When people walk they say they \\"foot\\". When giving directions, the following expressions are common: to slope means going in a particular direction which is not necessarily downhill; to branch means to turn. \\"To give someone a push\\" means to accompany a person home for some distance. When a car \\"sleeps\\" outside, it means it stays outside, not in the compound or in the garage. =Terms for witchcraft= A practitioner of witchcraft is referred to as a Witch doctor. The origin is unclear, and is not a direct translation from a Ugandan language. A practitioner of witchcraft in Uganda is referred to as a Witch-doctor, though this term is often also used to refer to practitioners of local medicines (e.g. herbal medicines). Nightdancer, however, refers to a person who has been possessed by a spirit, causing them to dance naked in the wee hours of the night, and very often causing them to defecate and smear human excrement on people's door posts. This usage can be found throughout Uganda, regardless of tribal origin. It eventually became synonymous with witch-doctors, as they were usually possessed by these spirits. Nightdancer, is also commonly used to refer to cannibals, not that this is a common practice. For example, a parent may say, You will become a nightdancer. to a child who is biting their fingernails. This implies that the child may eventually start eating human flesh instead of just fingernails. =Other terms= The word downer is used instead of lower, used in opposition to upper. For example: \\"I broke my upper leg, but my downer leg was paining, too.\\" The word paining is often used in place of the word hurting to mean the same thing. \\"Sorry\\" tends to be used in different ways in Uganda and England. Ugandans are perfectly correct to use the word to express sympathy and sadness for something undesirable that has happened to someone by saying \\"Oh, sorry\\" or \\"I'm sorry\\". However, in England direct use like this is now usually an expression of regret with some responsibility attached - a form of apology. If they were not involved and just mean to express sympathy, they are likely to be less direct - \\"I'm sorry to hear that\\" or \\"that's really sad\\", or \\"that's terrible\\". Ever is used to mean often, in the same way always is used in American English. It is the opposite of the exaggeration never. For example, if someone is often late, a Ugandan might say \\"She is ever late.\\" The Broadway play The Vagina Monologues had a brief, but notorious, appearance on the Ugandan stage before being banned by government censors. The brouhaha led to the entry of the word monologue into Ugandan English as a euphemism for vagina. The newspaper Red Pepper popularised the use of the word kandahar and after the 2010 World Cup, vuvuzela for vagina, and whopper for penis. The adjective whole is used to emphasise disapproval of conduct unbecoming a person's rank or station. Examples: \\"How can a whole Minister go to that cheap nightclub?\\" or \\"How can a whole headmaster dress so badly?\\" The usage is a direct translation from several Ugandan languages. Among younger people, proggie (shortened version of programme) is common when referring to one's social plans, e.g. Susan, what's your proggie for the weekend, let's hook up. The word Zibbs is an often used word to mean problems. Example: I failed the exam, now those are other zibbs This term originates from the Luganda word for problems ebizibu The adverb Just is often used at the end of the statement to express obviousness. Example: During a phone call, one would tell a friend, I am at home eating food, just. The noun Gas is in some scenarios used to denote physical strength as opposed to an air like fluid or gasoline. Example: I have no gas to read for the exam. Among students Paper means exam. One can normally hear Ugandan students exclaiming, The paper was hard! to mean that the exam was difficult. The noun Mob does not necessarily denote a large unruly crowd of people but can also be used to mean objects. In some contexts, to Ugandans, mob can mean \\"a lot\\" or \\"a significant amount\\". For example, There are mob people in that building means that there are a lot of people in the building. The people represented in the example do not have to be unruly to be referred to as a mob. Another example, We have mob food here means we have a lot of food. In the dialect of English used in Karamoja, to enjoy can be used as \\"to be married to\\", as in the sentence, \\"I used to enjoy Narot but now, since the divorce, I am enjoying Nakoto.\\" Borrowed terms Ugandan words are often inserted into English because the English equivalent does not convey the sense the Ugandan speaker intends. The standard English term brother-in-law applies to both a spouse's brother and a spouse's sister's husband. A man's relationship with these two entails two quite different sets of obligations and norms in Ugandan society. Thus Luganda speakers will often use muko (wife's brother) and musangi (literally ‚Äúone you met,‚Äù meaning you met at the girl's home while wooing her) to make the distinction. Sometimes only a prefix is borrowed. In Luganda the prefix ka- before a noun denotes smallness. A Member of Parliament, referring to a Finance Minister, said in a debate \\"the ka-man is innocent.\\" Ka-child and ka-thing are also common. Thus, in most cases it is used to refer to the size of an object. For example, many cell phones in Uganda have flash lights, or \\"torches,\\" as an accessory of the phones. Ugandans refer to this light as the \\"katorchi\\" since the light emitted from the phone comes from a small bulb at the top. But it can also be diminutive, such as in the case when a woman is telling her friends how she was bothered by an overly flirtatious young man on the taxi, \\"Eh! this ka-boy really disturbed me on the taxi. He would not stop asking for my number.\\" Here the ka is used not so much to refer to whether or not the boy was short or tall, but rather as a way to reflect how he bothered her. Ka-timba, however, in the context of building construction refers to a thin piece of steel (such as re-bar), rather than the wood which one might expect. On the other hand, akatimba (obutimba, plural) is the name for a mosquito net. Thus, as is common in Uganda, one word will have multiple, if not numerous, meanings depending on the context in which it is used, as will the prefixes. The Luganda conjunction nti is often slipped into English sentences instead of that. Thus, one will hear a quotation like \\"The Minister said nti corruption will not be tolerated.\\" If the speaker is skeptical he will use mbu instead of nti: \\"The Minister said mbu corruption will not be tolerated\\" implies that it's just talk; business will go on as usual. In some Ugandan languages, the same verb can be used express thanks, congratulations, and appreciation of a job well done. It is normal for an African working in his own garden to be thanked for his work by a passing stranger. If one buys a new car in Uganda, or wins a race, one should not be surprised to find themselves being thanked. People are also thanked early in the morning as a form of greeting. Therefore, a Luganda speaker may translate \\"gyebale\\" by saying \\"well done\\". They are just greeting others by way of thanking them for their usual work, not necessarily for a particular task. The expression well done is extrapolated to specific actions. Examples include well fought, to soldiers on the winning side after a war; well bought, to someone with a new car or house; and even well put on, to a well-dressed person.Note previous discussion on the interchangeability of to dress, to wear and to put on. Ugandans often create portmanteaus from Luganda English words. For example, \\"I am going to change into a dress\\" becomes \\"I'm going to ku-changi-nga.\\" In other cases, they add -ing at the end of a Luganda word; thus, a young girl can say \\"That gentleman was kwaana-ring me\\" to mean the gentleman was chatting me up. Or still letter \\"-d\\" or \\"-ed\\" can be added at the end of a Luganda word. For example, \\"Brenda kwanjula-d Brian at her parent's home\\" to mean \\"Brenda introduced Brian at her parent's home\\" Grammar differences Ugandans will frequently combine two sentences into one using the word and. For example, a barber will say \\"Sit down and I cut your hair,\\" or a messenger might say \\"They told me to come and you give me the package.\\" The usage makes sense in most Ugandan languages, but in these languages the word and is implied, not stated. The personal pronoun is usually added to imperative sentences. Thus, one hears the phrase \\"Go to Entebbe;\\" or \\"Please go to Entebbe\\" will become \\"You go to Entebbe.\\" \\"Please come here\\" becomes \\"You come.\\" \\"Let's go\\" becomes \\"we go\\". =Prepositions= Like many speakers of foreign languages, Ugandans change, add and omit prepositions that are normally used by native speakers. For example, Ugandans: * decrease on things, not decrease things * demand for things, not demand things * yield into things, not yield (produce) things or yield to (give way to) things Pronunciation Ugandan pronunciation of English varies widely depending on the level of education of teachers and the exposure to English. Since native speakers, English recordings, and dictionaries with pronunciation guides are not readily available to most Ugandans, they rely on spelling to guess how to pronounce words. As a result, visitors will hear \\"spelling pronunciation\\". For example, in Kampala, \\"acacia\\" as in Acacia Avenue is pronounced /a Ààka sia/, not /…ôÀàke…™ É…ô/ or /…ôÀàke…™ s…™…ô/. Spelling Standard English spelling rules are often flouted, even in official publications. For example, the word dining is frequently spelt \\"dinning,\\" which to a native English speaker would be pronounced with a \\"short\\" i , as if it refers to making a loud noise (din) rather than referring to the room in which eating takes place (dine). Businesses that are labelled saloons are, in reality, western salons. Another frequent change is the confusion of u and a . An example would be the use of \\"batter\\" for \\"butter\\" (spread on bread).

Ames was born in Montreal as the only son of Evan Fisher Ames (who founded the shoe manufacturer Ames, Holden & Company in 1856) and Caroline Matilda Brown. Ames inherited the family shoe company and later worked in insurance but used much of his fortune to help the poor and fight corruption. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Amherst College in 1885. He helped organize the Volunteer Electoral League and became alderman (City Councillor) in Montreal in 1898 and served until 1906. He became a Member of Parliament in 1904 as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, and served until 1920. In 1919 he served as a financial director for the League of Nations. He is best known for his book The city below the hill: a sociological study of a portion of the city of Montreal, Canada, which originally appeared in the form of newspaper articles in the Montreal Star in 1897. The book offered a sociological and statistical analysis of the conditions of the poor people in just south of downtown Montreal, including Griffintown, Little Burgundy, and part of Pointe-Saint-Charles. Ames was an avid philanthropist and funded a 39 unit apartment housing complex on William Street between Shannon and Ann for the poor called Diamond Court (see image). It has since been demolished. He died in Montreal in 1954 and is buried along with his wife in the North Head Cemetery located behind the Anglican Church on Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick.

Its name, meaning \\"White Stones\\", is of uncertain origin, since the massif is predominantly grey in color.Although there is some uncertainty regarding the name of the mountain, there is a local legend about the origin of the mountains and surrounding lagoons at P√°ramo de Piedras Blancas. It tells about the mourning into which the women of the local indigenous tribes fell after the conquistadors slaughtered their husbands. God, afflicted by \\"the suffering of His daughters\\", and wanting to alleviate their great sorrow, turned them into mountains, but still those \\"mountains\\" cried, giving origin with their \\"tears\\" to the local lagoons. If any tear became entrapped inside any frailej√≥n, or trap of the terrain, it would turn into a \\"stone as white as milk, of which there are thousands on the summits of the P√°ramo de Piedras Blancas\\". Pico Piedras Blancas lacks glaciers; however, seasonal snowfalls may briefly cover its flanks. From its summit and under clear conditions, Lake Maracaibo can be seen. One of the accesses to reach the base of the mountain, is through the Mifaf√≠ Condor Reserve, which hosts some specimens of this andean bird. Location Pico Piedras Blancas is located to the northeast of M√©rida, the state capital. Pico Piedras Blancas is very close to Pico Mucumam√≥, Pico Los Nevados and Pico El Buitre; all of them surround a high altitude valley in the heart of the Sierra de la Culata at approximately above sea level, known on topographic maps as Hoyo Negro (\\"Black Hole\\").  Elevation  A former measure of 4,762 metres, given by Jahn in 1910, was corrected to 4,737 metres in 1951. The latter measure was confirmed by a 2002 GPS survey. Climbing Though being the highest mountain of the Sierra de la Culata, it is not as frequently climbed as Pico Pan de Azucar in the same range of La Culata or the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada de M√©rida range. * Piedras Blancas can be best climbed during the dry season, from October to March * The principal accesses are two: through the Mifaf√≠ Condor Reserve, near Casa de Gobierno in the Trasandina road, and through the town of La Toma, nearby Mucuch√≠es, also in the Trasandina road * The normal route is through the eastern side of the massif  References  * Silva, Gustavo (2001). \\"Los Picos m√°s altos del Estado M√©rida-Venezuela\\".

James Finlay was financially well-off and, \\"as a gentleman farmer\\", operated a farm in Greenville named The Cedars. Finlay attended a private school in Greenville, and later attended Furman University, receiving a Bachelor of Literature degree in June, 1899. Finlay's older brother, John, had studied for the ministry and had been ordained to the diaconate, but died before he could be ordained to the priesthood. Soon after his graduation from Furman, Finlay left for Sewanee. While at Sewanee, during the summer of 1901, Finlay met his future wife, Lucy Reed of St. George; they married on April 22, 1903 in Clemson, South Carolina. Finlay's first cure was Holy Trinity, Clemson; additionally, Finlay was responsible for St. Paul's, Pendleton; Ascension, Seneca; and St. John's, Walhalla. The couple's first son, James Alexander Finlay, was born in 1906, but died in October, 1907. Finlay was called as rector of Trinity Church in Columbia in 1907; he remained there for thirteen years. During his time at Trinity Church, he helped move the parish away from the renting of pews as a source of income, and instituted \\"the Every Member Canvass as the chief source of parish support\\". In June, 1918, Finlay was granted a leave of absence to serve in France with the YMCA; he served for a total of seventeen months. Finlay returned from France in 1919, and was active politically when social justice concerns were debated in the state legislature. In 1920, Finlay was elected bishop coadjutor of the diocese, and he ended his term as rector of Trinity Church on December 31 of that year. He was consecrated bishop on January 20, 1921 by Bishops Williams Alexander Guerry (South Carolina, and acting for the Presiding Bishop), Frederick F. Reese (Georgia), and Joseph B. Cheshire (North Carolina). Episcopacy As bishop coadjutor of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina, Finlay was responsible for the Piedmont region of the state. The diocese was divided in October 1922, and he became bishop diocesan of the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina. During the 1920s and 1930s, Finlay was responsible for many endeavors to create churches and schools for African Americans. In 1928, he became Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Voorhees Normal and Industrial School for Negroes at Denmark, South Carolina. By 1934, all but the two South Carolina dioceses afforded African Americans representation with a vote in diocesan affairs, and Finlay was working hard to change this; though the change was not approved in the 1934 diocesan convention, it was approved in the 1947 diocesan convention. Finlay was one of the church leaders instrumental in the creation of the Kanuga Conference Center in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Finlay died at Kanuga on August 27, 1938. He is buried in the churchyard of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, Columbia, SC.

Hawkins Family =Static= Virgil Ovid Hawkins/Static (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is an African-American 9th grade high school student in Dakota City. As a result of accidental exposure to an experimental mutagen in an event known as the Big Bang, he gained the ability to control and manipulate electromagnetism, and uses these powers to become a superhero named \\"Static.\\" Countless others who were also exposed gained a wide variety of mutations and abilities, and Static spends much of his time dealing with these \\"Bang Babies\\", many of whom use their abilities in selfish, harmful, and even criminal ways. Virgil is an intelligent young man with a strong sense of justice, but grapples with a lot of self-doubt. He gradually becomes more mature and responsible with his powers over the course of the series. Virgil is named after the first African-American to go to law school (who was himself named for the Roman poets Virgil and Ovid). =Robert Hawkins= Robert Hawkins (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is a social worker who runs the Freeman Community Center as head counselor, he is a widower and the single father of two teenagers. Robert is a strict but caring parent. He strongly dislikes gangs and the destructive attitudes of most Bang Babies, and his work at the community center is motivated by a desire to counteract their bad influence on young people. In the episode \\"Static Shaq\\", it is mentioned that Robert has also been in the Marines and a camp counselor. In the episode \\"Blast from the Past\\", Robert states that when he was a kid, he was (and still is) a fan of the superhero Soul Power. In the episode \\"Linked\\", it is revealed that Robert played football in college, and he was nicknamed \\"Streak.\\" At first, Robert disliked Static; his open opinion about Static in the episode \\"Aftershock\\" left Virgil worried that the Big Bang might have aftereffects. Robert remained unaware of his son's secret identity through most of the series, although part of him had suspicions about Virgil's behavior. In the episode \\"Kidnapped\\", Robert acknowledged the truth that had been right under his nose: his son, Virgil, was Static. He figured this out as the reason why Omnara would have Puff and Onyx kidnap him in order to draw out Static. In the end following Omnara's defeat, Robert keeps his son's superhero identity along with Gear's secret, even from his daughter. =Sharon Hawkins= Sharon Hawkins (voiced by Michele Morgan) is Virgil's strong-willed, and caring older sister. Sharon attends college, but she still lives at home. She also volunteers at a hospital, and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center, like her father. Sharon has always been a big fan of Static. Although deep down, she and her younger brother do love each other in a brother-sister way, they frequently argue, challenge, and tease each other, mainly about things such as the household chores, his studying, and her cooking (which is usually barely edible). Sharon has been dating Adam Evans a.k.a. The Rubber- Band Man since the episode \\"Bent Out of Shape\\"; though she knows about his super identity, she genuinely cares for him. In the episode \\"Brother-Sister Act,\\" Sharon notices how similar Static and Virgil are, and tries to pin him down with proof of her suspicions, but is later tricked into thinking that her suspicions were wrong. In the episode \\"Out of Africa\\", she was the recipient of a golden spider amulet, which temporarily granted her the power/ability to create illusions; however when she returned the amulet to Anansi, the abilities vanished. At the end of the fourth season, Sharon continues to be in the dark about her brother's superhero secret, though in the final episode \\"Power Outage\\", she becomes suspicious once again of Virgil's behavior until their father interrupts them. =Jean Hawkins= Jean Hawkins (voiced by Alfre Woodard) is Robert's wife, and the mother of Sharon and Virgil. Jean is frequently mentioned throughout the series. In \\"Shock to the System\\", (the first episode of season 1), it was mentioned that she had died from gangfire; in \\"Flashback\\", in season 3, Jean Hawkins was shown to have been a paramedic, and that specifically she had been fatally wounded by a stray bullet during the Dakota Riots, which happened exactly five years prior to the events of the episodes of \\"Flashback\\". Her death is at the root of Virgil's intense dislike of guns, effectively preventing Virgil from getting involved too deeply in gangs. She was very important to all of her family, especially to Virgil, who was only 10 years old when she died. In \\"Tantrum\\", (season 1), Hawkins family movies show that she really knew what made Virgil tick even when he was a baby; it is also shown that Virgil visits his mother's grave and talks to her when he's troubled. Jean makes her only physical appearance in the events of \\"Flashback\\", when Static, Gear, Time-Zone and Ebon were all transported back in time by Time-Zone's powers to the night of the Dakota Riots. Although Static attempted to convince her to stay in a safe place, (even revealing that he was her son Virgil from the future), she still left to go on duty as a paramedic and was killed that night by a stray bullet by gangfire, but not before telling Virgil how proud she was of him having become a superhero‚Äîa statement which finally gave Virgil closure over her untimely death. Other heroes =Gear= Richard \\"Richie\\" Osgood Foley (voiced by Jason Marsden) is an ally of lead character Static, and Virgil Hawkins' best friend. The two go far back. He was not present for the Big Bang, but Static's clothes still carried some of the gas, and his powers were dormant until Season Three. His power is superhuman intelligence, having invented a number of weapons and devices for Static and himself to use. His superhuman intelligence allows for a very limited form of technopathy with his visor and Back-Pack, as seen in episode 52 when Richie was no longer able to interpret the data stream in his visor and his backpack was no longer able to sync with his brain, which was at genius level when Back-Pack was programmed. According to series creators, Richie's character was based on Rick Stone, Virgil's best friend in the comics, who is gay. However, since his sexual orientation could not be explored within the context of a children's television series at the time of the show's original run, it was never addressed if the TV series-character was gay as well, though McDuffie did consider him gay and make subtle nods to the fact that he is in some episodes. =Rubberband Man= Adam Evans/Rubber-Band Man (voiced by Kadeem Hardison) is a meta-human transmorph, whose body structure consists of living rubber, which he can shape into a wide variety of forms, even to the point of altering his physical appearance into that of another person. Adam's superhero handle is a probable nod to the song, \\"The Rubberband Man\\", by The Spinners. Much like Static, he changes his superhero look between seasons; in the first season, he has a full-body purple suit that covers his head, while in the second season he switches to a black suit (while leaving his head exposed). Since Rubber-Band Man and his brother Ebon can both stretch themselves, it is possible that the effects of the gas may have something to do with the person's genetic code. The name \\"Adam Evans\\" is derived from the names of former Milestone writers Adam Blaustein and Yves Fezzani, who created the character. The alias \\"Stringer\\" Rubber-Band Man uses in one episode is his real last name of his comic version, first used in Static #34. Adam is also a talented musician who is on the verge of a professional career. His greatest personal weakness is a reading disorder, which he has to struggle through. He is the younger brother of Static's archenemy, Ebon. Prior to the Big Bang, Adam was part of his brother's gang before he took a stock-clerk job at a music store called Stonegas Records. Rubber-Band Man first appears as a tragic villain when he goes after an opportunistic record producer who had stolen one of his songs. He would subsequently break out of prison but deciding not to pursue a criminal career, uses his powers to take up a new identity, \\"Stringer\\", and becomes a musical rising star. He also started dating Virgil's sister Sharon, and although he initially clashes with Static, he does not carry on his grudge against him after meeting Sharon, even reforming and becomes one of his allies in crime- fighting. While on patrol, Rubber-Band Man typically acts as an older brother figure to Static, keeping him from showing off and reminding him of consequences in their work ‚Äî something that Adam's real brother Ebon never actually did when he looked after Adam prior to the Big Bang. It is unknown if Adam Evans was exposed to the cure for the Big Bang that neutralized many of the Bang Babies in Dakota at the end of the series. =She-Bang= She- Bang/Shenice Vale (voiced by Rosslynn Taylor-Jordan) is a girl with superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and endurance. Although she seems like a meta-human she actually was not exposed to the gas; she is really a science project made by her parents, Jonathan and Dolores, who made her chromosome by chromosome. They fell in love with her and went into hiding from a group of people who want to clone her, so she had to act like a shy, normal person till she moved to Dakota trying to blend in with the other Bang-Babies. When all the people who were after her were captured, she and her parents moved back to Dakota where she assisted Static and Gear in fighting Madelyn Spaulding, Hotstreak, and Ebon's group. She has not been seen since. =Time-Zone= Nina Crocker/Time-Zone (voiced by Rachael MacFarlane) is a Bang Baby with the ability to warp time, allowing her to travel into the past; during her time with her abilities, she was one of the strongest and most powerful metahumans on the planet. While looking for Static and Gear, she bumped into Ebon. He wanted to use her powers to avoid the cops. After being saved from Ebon, Gear ran tests on her and found out that she had no control over her powers. Since she wanted to become a hero, Gear made a remote that was linked to a belt around her costume. The remote helped her control her powers. Now named as the superhero Time-Zone, Nina became the third member of the Shock Pack, but her time as a member was brief: Due to an encounter with Ebon, Nina decided that her powers were too dangerous to keep, and went back in time to stop her past self from being present at the night of the Big Bang (by stealing her own bike, according to Richie.) Nina is now a happy, ordinary girl, and has no memory of her life in the original timeline as Time-Zone. Time-Zone's powers were based on Flashback's from Blood Syndicate. =Anansi the Spider= Anansi the Spider (voiced by Carl Lumbly) is a superhero native to Ghana, and the greatest hero in West Africa. Named after the trickster spider of African folklore, Anansi has the power to create visible, realistic illusions. In his own words he explains it as: \\"people only see what I want them to see.\\" He also has the ability to cling to surfaces, standing upside-down, and walking on vertical surfaces. In both his appearances, references to Marvel Comics' Spider-Man are subtly made, to which he good naturedly replies \\"I get that a lot.\\" And when Virgil told him to hit a villain with a \\"web blast,\\" he replies, \\"I'm not that kind of spider.\\" He also seems to inspire Virgil (Static) about what it truly means to be a superhero. In the episode \\"Out of Africa,\\" Anansi travels to Dakota to stop Osebo, Mmboro, and Onini (three of his enemies, based on the animals that the legendary Anansi caught to attain his stories,) from obtaining an ancient, golden spider talisman, which is revealed to be the source of Anansi's powers. Static and Gear get drawn in when Sharon is kidnapped. In the end, Anansi reclaims the artifact, but not before Sharon used it to make all of the dirty dishes \\"disappear,\\" took it for a spin for a while, and got kidnapped. Static, Gear, and Anansi rescued her. The spider artifact was never seen again afterward, as Anansi made sure to hide it. =Soul Power= Morris Grant/Soul Power (voiced by Brock Peters) is an elderly superhero with powers similar to Static's; he now lives in a retirement home, but back in the 1960s, he protected Dakota from criminals. He gained his powers in an accident at Hoover Dam. He had a Batcave-like headquarters hidden underground in/near Dakota's rapid transit system called the Power Pad, and drove a car called the Soulmobile. Back then, he also had a sidekick, Sparky. He, Sparky, and Static teamed up in order to defeat Soul Power's greatest foe, Professor Menace, who disappeared after a battle with Soul Power in 1963. Note: Soul Power was similar to the DC Comics superhero Black Lightning who was intended to be used, but then they'd have to pay Tony Isabella. Sparky Phillip Rollins/Sparky (voiced by Rodney Saulsberry) was Soul Power's sidekick back in the 1970s, but he is now a meteorologist. Rollins took on the guise of Sparky one more time in order to help Static and Soul Power fight Professor Menace. Sparky told Static that his powers were derived from a suit he originally invented and wore so he could be like his idol Soul Power and fight alongside him. =Hoop Squad= The Hoop Squad heroes Pulverizer, Spin Drive, Center Force, and Point Man are superheroes who work for a secret government. They all have their powers in their bio-enhancer super-suits created by Dr. Mason Andrews and they have secret identities. When they are not fighting crime, they are famous NBA players Steve Nash, Yao Ming, Karl Malone, and Tracy McGrady. Pulverizer Pulverizer/Karl Malone (voiced by himself) is a member of the Hoop Squad. His bio-enhancer super-suit enables him to increase the size of his hands in order to crush things. Spin Drive Spin Drive/Tracy McGrady (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is a member of the Hoop Squad. His bio-enhancer super-suit enables him to rotate his body at super-speed enough to create vortexes. Centerforce Center Force/Yao Ming (voiced by Jen Sung Outerbridge) is a member of the Hoop Squad. His bio-enhancer super-suit enables him to extend his long limbs. Point Man Point Man/Steve Nash (voiced by Chris Cox) is a member of the Hoop Squad. His bio-enhancer super-suit enables him to fire various types of projectiles from his fingertips. Other Bang Babies =D-Struct= Derek \\"Zee-Bee\\" Barnett/D-Struct (voiced by Bumper Robinson) is a track athlete whose powers generated and enveloped him in a shroud composed of compressed ionic energy, which could both protect him from harm or be directed at targets, but which also gave him the appearance of a monstrous apparition. Derek was captured by Ebon and coerced into joining the Meta-Breed, (feeling he had no other choice), and was given the name \\"D-Struct.\\" Static was able to persuade Derek to quit the gang and return home to his mother. Afterwards, Derek volunteered himself as a subject for Bang Baby research. He is based on a character who appeared in both the Static and Hardware comics. =Dwayne McCall= Dwayne McCall (voiced by Blayn Barbosa) is a pre-teenaged boy who possesses reality-manipulating powers after exposure to Big Bang gas, allowing him to change things into anything else he can clearly imagine, (he has to know what they/it looks, smells, or sounds like, etc.). Dwayne is shy, misguided, and doesn't have very many friends; he also likes to conjure characters from his favorite comic books, computer games, TV shows and commercials, bringing them to life with his powers. His stepbrother, Aaron Price, finds out about his powers, and talks him into getting him free money and other goods from the banks and malls of Dakota. Static eventually discovers what's going on and tells Dwayne to stop listening to his brother. While Dwayne didn't believe what Static was saying (and tried to kill him in rage), Static plays a tape of himself (as Virgil) and Aaron talking. The tape was all that Dwayne needed to hear, as Aaron frequently expressed his dislike of Dwayne in the recording. Dwayne, hurt by Aaron's lies, decides to stop using his powers. Virgil's father Robert has worked with Dwayne, and found Aaron to be a very bad influence on him; Virgil knew his father was a better role model for Dwayne. It has been suggested that the character is an homage to Dwayne McDuffie, who co-created the characters out of his imagination, who (at the time) lived in a different state from the show's producers, and thus communicated with them only by phone. =Mirage= Miranda/Mirage (voiced by Gavin Turek) is a young girl with special light manipulation powers, which allowed her to generate visible, realistic illusions by manipulating light into anything she imagined or remembered. Her older brother was Byron (aka Boom), and they lived with their grandmother following their parents' death. Their powers came from stepping in a spill of the chemicals from the Big Bang. Mirage agreed to help Boom steal money to buy a new place for them to live (only because he is her older brother, a brother-sister relationship where he usually bosses her around), but after talking with Static, she sees how having powers has corrupted her elder brother and helps Static stop him. Mirage was then taken in by the Dakota City Department of Social Services, but not before she generated an illusion of Static flying into the distance, as a favor to Static (Static/Virgil needed to convince his sister that he was not Static). =Permafrost= Maureen Conner/Permafrost (voiced by Hynden Walch) is a mentally-broken homeless child. Following her mother's death and her stepfather abandoning her family, Maureen Conner became homeless, and developed psychiatric problems from the sheer rejection and loneliness. After the Big Bang, her hair turned white and her skin light blue, and she became an incredibly strong cryokinetic, able to create, manipulate and control frost, sleet, flurries, snow and ice, and create massive blizzards, hailstorms, and snowstorms. Around Christmas, Maureen turned to trouble-making, attracting the attention of Static. After learning about her tragic past from Reverend Anderson, Static managed to reach out and calm her down. The girl was taken to a local church for help in their homeless program, which she gratefully accepted when offered by Reverend Anderson. During that time, she sported her normal hair color and skin color indicating that she can go back and forth between her normal form and her icy form. =Nails= Allie Langford/Nails (voiced by T'Keyah Crystal Keym√°h) is a teenage girl who experienced a delayed reaction to the Big Bang. Allie's exposure to the Big-Bang has transmuted her literally into a 'Girl of Steel', along with the ability to lengthen and retract the length of her fingernails, as well as shoot them as projectiles and regenerate fingernails. Allie wore heavy make-up on her face and hands and took to wearing a full-length coat to hide her transformation from everyone, including her parents. In her attempts to find a cure without drawing attention to her condition, Allie learned of a Bang-Baby Clinic online and ventured to Gotham City. To her dismay, Nails (as Allie took to calling herself) learned that the clinic was in fact a hoax to hire meta-human mercenaries for personal gain orchestrated by Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, who played on Allie's insecurities and her desire to be returned to normal to persuade her into helping them rob a ship full of gold, in exchange for a cure. Static and Batman foil the scheme however as Static talks her out of getting even with Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn. After having been reunited with her parents in Dakota, Allie was sponsored for a treatment program at a new Bang-Baby clinic established by Batman's alter-ego Bruce Wayne, where she began to make progress in controlling the change and reversing her \\"metallic affliction\\". =Dul√©= Dul√© Jones (voiced by Marshall \\"Rock\\" Jones) is a former gangbanger. He has metal tentacles which grow from his back (similar to Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Octopus). Unlike fellow gang member Chainlink, Dule can retract his tentacles, and thus hide the fact that he is a Bang Baby. After the Big Bang, Dule gives up his gang lifestyle to play professional football, but Chainlink tries to blackmail him for money, threatening to reveal his secret. When they confront each other, everyone finds out that his powers are more advanced than Dule's (due to the fact that he breathed in more gas). Then Dule goes public, defusing the threat and defeating Chainlink in a confrontation with help from Static, Gear, and other football players. =The Meta-Breed= The Meta-Breed is a large gangster group of Bang Babies led by Ebon. Ebon Ebon/Ivan Evans (voiced by Gary Anthony Sturgis) head of a large group of Bang Babies including Shiv and Talon, Ebon is an unusually powerful and strong umbrakinetic trans-morph; a living shadow and inter-dimensional portal able to hide within, control and manipulate pure darkness and shadows, as well as transport others to various locations of his choice. His weakness is strong sources of light. Ebon's real name is Ivan Evans, and he is Rubberband Man's older brother. Ebon is always recruiting newer and much stronger members to add to his crew and has come head-to-head with several other Bang Babies over the course of his life. Besides his rivalry with Static and Gear, Ebon also does not get along too well with Madelyn or Hot-Streak. Ebon had always held a grudge against Static for ruining so many of his plans. Some of his attacks against Static would even become lethal, but Static would still defeat him. When Dr. Todd's Bang Baby cure was transforming them back into humans, Ebon staged a plan to get the last vial of Bang Baby gas and stage another Big Bang, one that would potentially create hundreds more Bang Babies than the first one. Ebon and Hot- Streak fought over the final vial of gas and, being exposed to an overdose of it, merged into one giant Bang Baby-monster which combined both of their powers. With Static and Gear being the only two remaining Bang Babies, they were able to take down Ebon and Hotstreak by blowing up a fuel tank inside their body, but it remains unknown whether the Bang Baby beast survived this final confrontation. Ebon's powers as a living shadow and inter-dimensional portal, are a nod to the \\"Shadowslide\\", the method of teleportation utilized by the Shadow Cabinet, one of Milestone Media's title series'. They are also similar to Shadow Thief's powers. Shiv Getting his 'nom-de-crime' from a shiv (a kind of bladed weapon), Shiv (voiced by Brian Tochi) is the immature jokester of the Meta-Breed; in fact, when he encountered the Joker, he tells the villain \\"Big fan, big fan...\\". He has been described as insane by both fans and creators of the show and comics. Shiv may be one of the many Bang Babies whose mental health was affected by the Big Bang, but this is never confirmed; he may simply just be an eccentric, childish jokester. Shiv's abilities enable him to generate pure whitish-pink \\"light energy\\", which he could blast at opponents, and fashion into numerous useful tools and weapons which he could hold, throw, or fashion around his arms and hands, giving rise to his new alias; 'Shiv.' Shiv is assumed to have either returned to normal, or is now among the reinfected Dakota's Bang-Baby population at the end of the series. Talon A teenage girl, Talon/Teresa (voiced by Tia Texada) is a metahuman whose exposure to the Big Bang transformed her into a humanoid avian bird, a fact which she was really bitter about throughout the series. As a metahuman, Talon had clawlike digits on her hands and talon-like digits on her feet; she was covered in white orange feathers, but retained her red hair color. The most notable attribute of her transformation was a set of feathered patagia extending from her scapula to her forearms, which enabled her to fly by flapping her arms. As an offensive aspect bestowed upon her by her exposure to the Big Bang, Talon could emit incredibly strong, large, visible lavender- colored hypersonic shrieks from her mouth and vocal cords (similar to the Marvel Comics superhero Banshee and DC's Black Canary), although her hypersonic sound abilities are completely useless if her mouth is gagged. Talon was first introduced as a member of the Meta-Breed, making her a frequent opponent of Static. When the cure was introduced, Talon accompanied Ebon, Hot-Streak, and Shiv to steal the last canister of gas. However, before they could escape, Talon was restored to normal, and she was more than glad to stay that way. Ebon, whose powers were deteriorating, was forced to leave her behind; at the hospital, she abandoned the name of Talon for her real name, and told Static and Gear that Ebon was going to use the gas to set off another Big Bang. That night, Teresa got kidnapped by Ebon, who refused to let her leave his side, and was taken to the docks to be re-exposed. She was saved by Static and Gear, who were captured shortly afterwards. In return, she freed them and escaped the area, just before Ebon and Hot-Streak began wreaking havoc as a fused super-enhanced, flame-and-shadow monster. Francis Stone/F-Stop/Hotstreak Hotstreak Hotstreak/Francis \\"F-Stop\\" Stone (voiced by Danny Cooksey) was one of the gang members at the docks when the Big Bang occurred. After being exposed to the gas, Francis Stone became Hotstreak. His powers added to his hotheadedness by giving him the ability to create and shoot blasts of fire. His powers are loosely based on the Human Torch and Pyro. In the TV show, his bullying seems mainly driven by his crush on Frieda. Hotstreak was one of Static's very first rivals ‚Äî giving him a challenge nearly every time they meet. The fights seem to be personal in some way, since Static and Hotstreak already had history with each other as Virgil and Francis prior to the Big Bang. Before the Big Bang, Francis was a feared school bully and gang leader who went under the nickname of \\"F-Stop\\" and often went after Virgil for his wisecracks at his expense. He seemed to mellow out as the series went on, and with enough time he might have reformed into a good guy. There was evidence of this in the Season 4 episode \\"No Man's An Island\\" when he skipped a chance to escape the island in order to go save the others, and stopped the troops from attacking Static, Gear, Rubberband Man and Talon by taking Alva hostage. He was also seemingly touched by Static's effort to risk his life to save Alva's son ‚Äî to the point where he joined Static in the effort to save Edwin. Unfortunately, when Dr. Todd's Bang Baby cure was turning the Bang Babies back into humans, Ebon staged a plan to get the last vial of Bang Baby gas and stage another \\"Big Bang\\" ‚Äî one that would potentially create more Bang Babies than the first one. Ebon and Hotstreak fought over the final vial of gas and, being exposed to an overdose of it, merged into one giant Bang Baby-monster which combined both of their powers. With Static and Gear being the only two remaining Bang Babies, they were able to take down Ebon and Hotstreak by blowing up a fuel tank inside their body, but it remains unknown whether the monster survived this final confrontation. Aquamaria Aquamaria/Maria (voiced by Erika Velez in \\"Bad Stretch,\\" Yeni √Ålvarez in \\"Wet and Wild\\") is a girl, who was transformed into a transmorph, in her case a being of living water, by the Big Bang. Unlike other Bang Babies with transmorphic abilities like Rubber-Band Man, Aquamaria could not change back and forth from her true human form for Lex (at least she was never seen to have such an ability in either of her appearances during the series' run). The only known background information given about Aquamaria is that she has a mother and a younger sister, who she lived with before she was exposed to Big Bang gas, not returning home after becoming a Bang Baby. As a life-form composed of colloidal water, the Bang-Baby known now as Aquamaria is capable of hydrokinetic abilities, able to manipulate her own form, expanding or compressing her physical mass and 'shapeshifting' parts of her body (like turning her hand and forearm into a net/bag to gather up cash when she and Hot-Streak robbed a music store in Wet and Wild.) In a fight, Aquamaria can aim a pressurized water attack from her arms similar to a geyser, or become one herself. Able to merge with a larger body of water, Aquamaria can overwhelm opponents by becoming a living flood. In her first appearance in Bad Stretch (in season 2), Aquamaria, having been recruited by Ebon into the Meta- Breed, was undergoing her initiation by first robbing a stadium with the intention to lure out Static, and then take him down one-on-one. Ebon had been counting on her victory as he had thought that \\"her water powers would stop him for sure.\\" While Aquamaria had successfully shorted out Static's powers, she was taken on and captured by the Rubber-Band Man. She was then taken into police custody and kept contained by a specialized containment unit that was custom-made just for her. Aquamaria was later broken out of jail, along with other members of the Meta-Breed, by Ebon disguised as Rubber-Band Man to frame him. When Static revealed Ebon's deception and the gang Ebon lead as the Meta- Breed while the Rubber-Band Man fought Ebon alone, he then had to take on Aquamaria, successfully neutralizing her by using his head and electrolysis to break her down from water into hydrogen and oxygen‚Äîwhile she survived this, it left her unconscious. Aquamaria later teamed up with Hot-Streak, but was frozen by Static and Gear. Later, a team of scientists offered her the chance to be the first to try their antidote for the Big Bang mutagen, and despite an attempt by Hot-Streak to sabotage the treatment, Aquamaria was eventually returned to normal. She was based on a Blood Syndicate character. Slipstream Slipstream/\\"Heavy-C\\" (voiced by Bumper Robinson) is a heavy-set teenage bully (with a voice pattern similar to Fat Albert) who always steals other people's food like the kids at Burger Fool. Slipstream was affected by the Big Bang and given incredible wind powers. After his fight with Static where Static defeated him after having to recharge, he was rarely heard from again. Slipstream was seen in \\"Power Outage\\" among the nearly de- powered Bang Babies who were following an offer from Ebon to have their powers restored. Boom After both of their parents died and they were taken in by their grandmother, Boom/Bryon (voiced by Rickey D'Shon Collins) and his younger sister Mirage/Miranda were exposed to a spill of the Big Bang gas. Boom was able to generate large and unusually strong amounts of hypersonic sound waves from a loudspeaker on his chest, causing massive amounts of damage. Mirage's powers are of illusion-casting. Boom and Mirage steal a lot of money; Boom claims it's for supporting his grandmother. While it is implied that Boom's aggressive personality may have been the result of his exposure to Big-Bang gas (as Mirage reveals to Static that her brother never acted like that before), Mirage keeps her own personality and becomes increasingly disturbed by Boom's actions (as Boom's Quantum Vapour-exposure may have just brought out a worse side of him he had just never shown before). Mirage finally helps Static trap her brother, and in return, creates an illusion of Static flying away (to mislead Sharon, who was starting to suspect that Virgil and Static were one and the same). Boom was seen in Power Outage as one of the meta-humans wanting to have their powers restored where the loudspeaker on his chest was gone; both Boom and his sister are presumed to have been returned to normal. Note: He resembles Siryn from the X-Factor. Carmendillo A teenage boy mutated into a humanoid armadillo, Carmendillo (voiced by Matt Ballard in seasons 1‚Äì2, Jason Marsden in seasons 2-4) possessed a bulletproof hide and could be launched like a projectile. He lives in garbage cans and steals food, and mostly has his mind set on eating. (He hates robbing places with no food courts.) At one point, Carmendillo was accompanied by a dog-like Bang Baby, (similar to the Blood Syndicate character Dogg), whom he calls \\"Chomper\\". Carmendillo had worked with the Meta-Breed and the Meta-Men, but mostly operated by himself, serving pretty much as comic relief. In every episode he appeared, he only acts at the beginning and is quickly defeated, sometimes without interfering with the central plot. He is always in a group for one episode and then quits stating that he would not be in any group again as seen in A League of Their Own. It is unknown why he joined The Meta-Breed and The Meta-Men. When he first worked for The Meta-Breed, he got scared due to Ebon hearing his brother is one of the good guys after nearly robbing a store; he was defeated after getting repelled by Static, but was later freed by Ebon. He almost fought Static again but did not and was so scared that he hid in a ball pen and quit. His work with The Meta-Breed was short after being taken out by Hawkgirl. Afterwards, he fought Static again on his own stating that he's been working out, is muscular and his eyes started to have pupils. He is last seen in the episode \\"Where Rubber Meets The Road\\" where he is seen in a bar with other Bang Babies and makes fun of Tarmac stealing a valuable generator for only a $1000 and informs him of Alva's $1,000,000 reward. Monster Tamara Lawrence (voiced by Airyan Johnson in human form, Dee Bradley Baker in monster form) teenage girl that was caught in the Big Bang. She can now turn into a monster and has superhuman strength. She wanted revenge on her boyfriend Marcus Reed for not showing up at the docks, so she decided to frame him. With her appearance, she could easily do so. Static and Gear bought this at first, but Static found out and defeated her. She was taken into custody soon after that. She appeared in Power Outage after she was weakening due to Dr. Todd's Bang Baby cure which was spreading through the air. She joined Ebon's crew to regain them, along with several other Bang Babies. Ebon/Hot-Streak - \\"Ebon-Streak\\" When Dr. Todd's Bang Baby cure was transforming them back into humans, Ebon staged a plan to get the last vial of Bang Baby gas and stage another ‚ÄúBig Bang‚Äù, one that would potentially create more Bang Babies than the first one. Ebon and Hot-Streak fought over the final vial of gas and, being exposed to an overdose of it, merged into one giant Bang Baby-monster which combined both of their powers. With Static and Gear being the only two remaining Bang Babies, they were able to take down Ebon-Streak by blowing up a fuel tank inside their body, but it remains unknown whether the monster survived this final confrontation. =The Rough Pack= The Rough Pack are a gang of three Bang Babies led by Hyde, but the group went inactive after Kangor and Ferret left the group. Ferret wanted to fend for himself while Kangor was going to find a better group. Hyde Real name unknown, Hyde (voiced by Tone L≈çc) is physically mutated with thick folded skin, making him tougher and stronger (like Rhino from Marvel Comics). Hyde managed to grab a piece of Static's coat, had Ferrett track down Static for some payback for ruining his plot, and nearly discovered his identity. Hyde's lead was short after being defeated by Static who turned him into a basketball. The alias 'Hyde' comes from the fact that his skin has become thick and wrinkly like a rhinoceros or an elephant's 'hide' with the name being a similar spelling to Mr. Hyde. Kangor Kangor (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is an original character to the animated series who has never appeared in the comic books. Kangor's real name is never mentioned, and much of his backstory is never brought up in the series‚Äîwhich puts Kangor across as just another juvenile delinquent gangbanger; according to the episode \\"Gear\\", Kangor had done time in Juvenile hall with Ivan/Ebon in the time back before the Big Bang‚Äîbut with some common sense, making him into one of the more formidable Bang Babies in the series. Kangor was another one of the victims of the Bang Baby gas incident at the docks. A Jamaican American in his late teens, Kangor speaks with a Jamaican accent, and Jamaican music starts to play whenever he shows up or starts a fight. Kangor's exposure and reaction to the Big Bang gas has super-developed his lower body, especially his feet; the bone and muscle mass of Kangor's legs and feet is noticeably larger than his upper body, endowing him with incredible lower body strength and giving rise to his nom-de-crime. Kangor prefers to get around by jumping rather than by walking (probably because of his big feet getting in the way of each other due to their size). In battle, Kangor typically leaps or cartwheels into action; his kicks are powerful enough to smash stone and concrete with one hit. Aside from being the first villain featured in the intro for season two‚ÄîKangor makes his first appearance in The Big Leagues. Kangor, along with Hot-Streak, Talon, and Shiv, under the leadership of The Joker formed a new team in Dakota. He is first seen when Ferret's gag is taken off and the members of The Joker's crew are revealed. Kangor uses his feet later on to break into the Dakota Bank in a heist along with the other Bang Babies in The Joker's crew. Kangor is arrested at the end of the episode, but comes back to make his second appearance in season 2 in \\"Static Shaq\\" as a part of The Rough Pack, only to get a taste of his own medicine by Shaq. Kangor was the first known Bang Baby to be seen cured by Dr. Todd's aerosol Bang Baby cure at the end of the series where he woke up in the hospital with his legs and feet back to human size. Ferret Another victim of the Big Bang gas, Ferret (voiced by Chick Vennera) has a nose that became much larger and gave him an incredible sense of smell, which was so acute he could tell Static was coming by smelling the ionized oxygen which surrounded him when his power was active. Ferret's encounters with Static were few. Ferret seems to be a big fan of Shaquille O'Neal, but was forced by Hyde to attack him, while he hesitated attacking the famous NBA Player, and ultimately defeated by him. Ferret's second encounter with Static was at a farmer's market, but ended with the Joker gassing him. He was cured by Batman‚Äôs antidote and eventually began to cause trouble again, but not before along with all the other Bang Babies, he was reverted to his human form, when the antidote was spread throughout the city. Ferret does not really fight because of his size and non-offensive power, but is forced to by Hyde in Static Shaq and was defeated and again taken into police custody. After that Ferret and Kangor both quit and joined The Meta-Breed; Ferret did not return until Season 4. Like most of the other Bang Babies, he was changed back to normal by Dr. Todd's antidote. =The Night-Breed= The Night-Breed are a group of Bang Babies recruited by Ebon. Its members are Bang Babies who have a fatal sensitivity to light, so they live underground. They are also very distinguishable, due to their vividly yellow-colored predator-type eyes. After Static and Gear thwart Ebon's plan, the Night-Breed refuses the duo's offer to help and retreat back into the darkness, though not without promising to remain their friends. It is assumed that after the events of the series' finale, \\"Power Outage\\", they are returned to their normal, non-powered state. Despite the sole episode in which they appear making reference to more of these Bang Babies (season 4's \\"Army of Darkness\\"), these four are the only known members: Nightingale Nightingale/Gail (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey) generates and controls a special black smoke-like dust called dark matter that she uses to protect herself from intense light and as a cover screen for escapes. Nightingale lives underground along with other light- sensitive Bang Babies and is recruited by Ebon, who names them the Night- Breed, but she turns on Ebon during his attempt to blanket the entire city in pure \\"dark matter\\" (giving them free rein of it), absorbing it into herself. Brickhouse Brickhouse (voiced by Dawnn Lewis) is Nightingale's best friend whom the Big Bang granted the ability to morph her body into a living brick-like humanoid state. She turns against Ebon when he traps Static, Gear, and Nightingale, and helps them escape. Brickhouse is based on one of the central characters of Blood Syndicate. Tech Tech (voiced by Freddy Rodriguez) is a human who the Big Bang gave him superhuman intelligence. He uses it to build a machine to cover the city in dark matter, and sides with Ebon when Nightingale and Brickhouse rebel and help Static and Gear to thwart it. Afterward, Tech decides to work on a cure for the Night-Breed's light sensitivity. Fade Fade (voiced by Freddy Rodriguez) is physically intangible, i.e. he has the ability to pass through virtually anything. Fade sides with Ebon when Nightingale and Brickhouse rebel against him, and goes back into hiding after their attempted takeover of Dakota is thwarted. He is based on one of the central characters of Blood Syndicate. Other villains =Aron Price= Aron Price (voiced by R.J. Knoll) is a teenage boy who hangs out with several unruly crowds. Aron was in reform school when the Big Bang happened and he wanted to gain powers for himself. When he's released and finds out about his step-brother Dwayne's Bang Baby powers (the ability to warp reality), Aron tells his brother to manipulate them to get him free money and other goods from the banks and malls of Dakota. Static eventually discovers what's going on and tells Dwayne to stop listening to his brother. While Dwayne didn't believe what Static was saying (and tried to kill him in a rage), Static plays a tape of himself (as Virgil) and Aron talking. The tape was all that Dwayne needed to hear, as Aron frequently expressed his dislike of Dwayne in the recording. After Aron ordered him to kill Static, Dwayne stopped listening to his step-brother and Static stuck Aron to a wall. Aron was then arrested and sent to prison. =Chainlink= Chainlink/Troy (voiced by Bumper Robinson) was once a member of the same gang as Dule. Both were exposed together to the Big Bang gas and both gained metal tentacles and the ability to absorb metal objects, but Chainlink suffered the brunt of the attack. While Dule could hide his powers, Chainlink could not and was forced to hide in the shadows. Jealous of the success and fame of his brother's football career, Chainlink attempted to extort Dule into giving him 90% of all his earnings. After Dule attempted to kill Chainlink but failed, the two had a final showdown at the football stadium, where Chainlink was eventually defeated and taken away by the police. He is similar to the Marvel character Doctor Octopus. He never made another appearance. =Edwin Alva Jr./Omnifarious= The son of Edwin Alva, Omnifarious/Edwin Alva Jr. (voiced by Matt Ballard) uses stolen Big Bang gas to give himself a variety of temporary metahuman powers (Edwin Alva Jr. found a way to have control over the gas) and called himself \\"Omnifarious\\" (at first, Static mistakes this for \\"I'm nefarious.\\"). At first, Alva Jr. attacked his father's factories, warehouses, and cargo ships in order to finally gain his father's respect since he never had time for his son. Later, Alva Jr. combined all the samples of his altered/refined mutagenic gas, intending to use all those powers to destroy the main Alva Industries building, but was instead turned into stone following an overload which he couldn't control. He was the first villain to learn Static's real identity. Ironically, it was only after losing his son in this way that Alva Sr. finally realized what he had lost and committed all possible resources into restoring him to flesh and blood, including hiring Specs and Trapper as additional help (which was a useless move, since they would work on their own secret projects rather than do what their employer said). In \\"No Man's Island\\", Alva finally restores Edwin Jr. to normal with the combined help of Static, Gear, and Hot-Streak. When Edwin Jr. turned back into flesh and blood, he had no powers and was completely back to normal as he reunites with his father. =Royce Axelrod= Royce Axelrod (voiced by Bumper Robinson) was a student at Dakota Union High School, but was in fact nothing more than a thug; Royce is an aggressive juvenile delinquent and an impulsive thief with a history of stealing prior to the events of the episode \\"Pop's Girlfriend.\\" His 'best friend' (the term is used loosely) was Frankie, his shadow, lap-dog, doormat, flunky, and 'Yes-Man' for most of the episode. It was hinted in the episode that he may have had some prior association with F-Stop. In his first appearance in the episode, Royce and Frankie are racing to catch the subway; Royce pushes a news stall vendor down as he reaches the steps, followed by Frankie who then both proceed to jump over the ticket stalls to avoid paying and run to get on the train before the doors close. While still on the train, Royce sees a large man in a fancy suit, with a metal briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, who then sits down and unlocks the cuffs to tend to his wrist‚ÄîRoyce sees an opportunity to take the briefcase, (even though he has no clue what's inside) and times it so that the doors have closed after he and Frankie have made it off and the man is trapped inside. At school, when a preoccupied Virgil Hawkins bumps into Royce by accident, Royce was hostile towards him, ignoring Virgil's apology and would have started a fight, had the principal not been there in the hallway watching the whole thing. Richie Foley comments on what Royce's trouble-making tendencies would result in: \\"Royce Axelrod: most likely to be sent Upstate.\\" In an alley, after school, Royce and Frankie having taken the metal briefcase, break into it with a screwdriver and discover three vials of a glowing purple liquid inside, along with some papers. While remaining hidden from a patrolling police car, they keep the briefcase with them, now hoping to turn the \\"purple stuff\\" into \\"green stuff.\\" Royce keeps the briefcase hidden in his locker because he can't keep it at home; according to him, \\"after that shoplifting thing, my mom's been on the lookout for stuff that don't belong to me.\\" Royce then brings up the papers he found inside and tells Frankie they're going to stay behind after school so that Frankie can use the computers to look up the vial's codes \\"about the purple stuff.\\" When their research reveals that the 'purple stuff' they stole is, in fact, \\"Big Bang Super-Juice,\\" Royce decides to inhale some of the gas, only thinking about the super powers that the gas could give him, \\"like it did to F-Stop,\\" but Frankie speaks out against it and their arguing causes a few drops to fall into a wastepaper basket, and before their actions went any further, the arrival of a teacher makes them leave the computer lab with the case hidden away. Their actions however, were not without consequences, as a spider and a cockroach are exposed to the Big Bang liquid that spilled into the bin, and grow to giant size. The next day, Royce appears at school, and to Frankie's surprise, Royce had grown noticeably bigger, taller, and stronger than before, able to tear a hardback school textbook in half like it was paper; to Frankie's dismay, he blows Frankie off as a \\"loser,\\" now that the Big Bang liquid was starting to take effect. This is not enough for Royce; after the results of just smelling the gas, he plans to drink the liquid and see what will happen to him next. Royce never got to go through with it; during a class test, Royce spontaneously mutates into a hideous, misshapen humanoid Bang-Baby, with pale pink skin and a primitive mentality. The 'monster' that Royce had now become attacked anyone within reach. In the end, Static restrained Royce using the arms of a statue to confine him. What became of Royce after these events was never revealed before the end of the series, though it can be assumed he was most likely subjected to Dr. Todd's Bang Baby cure when he exposed Dakota City to it. Frankie Frankie (voiced by Rel Hunt) is/was a student at Dakota Union High School. Frankie is a juvenile delinquent, who hung out with Royce all the time. For most of the episode, Frankie can be seen as Royce's lap dog, going along with all of Royce's antics, until Royce opts to expose himself to samples of Big Bang gas they had found in a metal briefcase they had stolen from a man on the subway. Frankie however, was against exposing himself to the gas, not wanting to become a freak. When Royce's initial reaction to the gas had him grow taller in size, he more-or-less blew Frankie off as a \\"loser\\" in favor of his new status. When Royce mutated into a misshapen humanoid in the middle of class, Frankie was confronted by Virgil Hawkins, who then knew that Frankie knew where the stolen briefcase with the vials of Big Bang gas was hidden. Frankie's fate after the events of the episode remains unknown. =Leech= Leech (voiced by David Arquette) is able to do just what his name implies‚Äîleech the powers from any Bang Baby and keep them as his own (like his bloodsucking namesake, only different). Unfortunately, after a while the powers would wear out, and Leech required the host to be ‚Äúsucked‚Äù dry again. Every time he drains an unwilling host's powers, he gets a physical feature of them, like a hairdo (as was the case with Hotstreak and Static) or something related to the host's power (like Talon's wing feathers on her arms). While he had some of the most powerful Bang Babies in his clutches, including Ebon, Hotstreak, Talon, and Static, he had the chance to steal Gear's powers, but not knowing he had any, Leech dismisses his powers as \\"the kind you could buy from a hardware store\\". His plans were foiled by Static and Lil‚Äô Romeo. Remembering what Static had said about his powers, Lil‚Äô Romeo \\"shorted\\" out Leech after he absorbed Static's powers, frying him and leaving him unconscious. Leech's final fate after the episode remains unknown. =Madelyn Spaulding= Once attending Dakota Union High School, Madelyn Spaulding (voiced by Kimberly Brooks) was a self-centered and controlling girl. During Season 2 in the episode \\"Attack of the Living Brain Puppets,\\" no one wanted to vote for her for freshman class president, which was so stressful for her that it triggered her Bang-Baby powers. She used her newly discovered powers to brainwash the students, making them behave like zombies (or \\"brain puppets,\\" as her victims were referred to in the episode). Virgil was able to evade her mind control because his powers enhanced his body's natural electrical field to block her power. Once she entered Richie's mind, she discovered Static's secret identity. After having Pops, Sharon, Richie and all of the other Dakota Union students turn against him, as a result of Madelyn's mind control, Static electrified her brain, erasing her memory of ever being a Bang Baby and of Static's secret identity. At the end of this episode, Madelyn was hospitalized. Madelyn shows up again later during Season 4 in the episode \\"She-Back!\\" She was released from the hospital and eventually was forced to work in a comic book store; however, she wasn't allowed back in school. She was only able to remember a few moments from her encounter with Static. Her encounter with the superhero resulted in the loss of her original powers and the gaining of new powers, which enabled her to telekinetically move things. This was triggered from her anger caused by thinking Virgil and Richie were laughing at her. She freed Hotstreak, Ebon, and Talon from jail and took the role as leader of the team. Her lead was short however, as she fought with Ebon over leadership. Static shows up and once again, shocks Madelyn's mind into submission and defeats the Meta-Breed with the help of Gear and She-Bang. What happened to Madelyn in the aftermath is left unrevealed. =Puff= Puff (voiced by Kimberly Brooks) is a woman whose exposure to the Big-Bang granted her the ability to either partially or completely transmute her body back and forth from her human state into a mass of living gas, in which state, Puff can become as light as air, allowing her to fly and become somewhat intangible. This also makes her vulnerable to water or large gusts of wind when she's in her gaseous state. The nature of her gaseous state is affected by her moods, this 'Mood-Gas' can become different vapors such as acid, (which she makes the most use out of, she also learned to compress these and blow them out like darts, calling them \\"Puff Darts\\"), knockout gas, which she can exhale at targets and victims, or a combustible gas, (which she can ignite using a blowtorch). According to her first appearance in \\"Bent Out of Shape\\", in season 1, Puff and her partner in crime, Onyx dropped out of school after they got their powers, afterwards they lived on the street and Puff started calling herself \\"Puff\\". She has more of a temper than Onyx. When they see that a reward is being offered for the capture of Rubberband Man, Puff decides that they will become bounty hunters. While Puff and Onyx would consider themselves to be aspiring bounty hunters, they are basically no more than thieves and mercenaries working for whoever pays them the most. Puff has always been seen accompanied by Onyx, but she did briefly lead a group of Bang Babies she'd named the \\"Meta-Men\\", a team consisting of herself, Onyx, Hot-Streak and Carmendillo, who she had recruited to gang-up on Static and Gear; the Meta- Men, however, were easily dispatched by Flash, Batman and Hawkgirl; after this, the Meta-Men never reassembled. Puff and Onyx were later contracted by Omnara to capture Robert Hawkins. Puff originally appeared in the Static Milestone comics, in a teamup with a girl called \\"Coil\\", a girl who could telekinetically control ropes. Her powers are similar to Vapor from the U-Foes. Onyx Onyx (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is a man whose exposure to the Big Bang transformed him into a giant purple-colored 'boy of stone', granting him superhuman strength and durability, but which also makes him physically slow, heavy and ungraceful. He essentially serves as Puff's strong man, who is able to crush and smash things in his way with very little effort. Onyx is usually more mellow than Puff and early on tries to be the voice of reason, but would always do what she tells him to in order to get the job done. Onyx is Puff's longtime friend, even before they were exposed to the Big Bang gas. According to his first appearance in \\"Bent Out of Shape\\", in season 1, Onyx and his partner in crime, Puff, dropped out of school after they got their powers, afterwards they lived on the street and he became known as \\"Onyx\\". When they see that a reward is being offered for the capture of Rubberband Man, Puff decides that they will become bounty hunters. While Puff and Onyx would consider themselves to be aspiring bounty hunters, they are basically no more than thieves and mercenaries working for whoever pays them the most. Puff and Onyx were later contracted by Omnara to capture Robert Hawkins. =Ragtag= An old man that was affected by the Big Bang gas, Ragtag (voiced by Richard Libertini) is able to transfer Bang Baby powers; this allows him to temporarily bestow abilities unto ordinary humans as well as relinquish those belonging to actual metahumans, but apparently he cannot make use of any powers himself. His only real \\"power\\" is the one he holds over the people he gives the powers to; once they wear off, they always return to him. In order for him to keep giving, they must steal for him. However, it works both ways as he can suck the powers out of a metahuman as well as seen with his battle with Static. Static eventually found out about Ragtag's powers and took him down with the help of Richie. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards. Run, Jump, and Push The three cohorts of Ragtag, all of whom he granted special powers to do his dirty work for him. * Run (voiced by Philip Tanzini) has super-speed, allowing him to move at a higher rate, both in locomotion and mobility. * Jump (voiced by Kenny Blank) can practically jump through space instantly ‚Äî an ability preferably referred to as teleportation. * Push can generate purple energy (usually from the hands) to repel or deflect objects (hence the name); Push can also use this power defensively by generating a protective sphere around himself, capable of holding outside forces at bay, at least for as long as he still has power in him. He could also use his powers to exercise a form of levitation where he channels his power to the ground to act as propulsion, propelling him high into the air. It remains unknown what became of Run and Jump after the events of the episode. ‚ÄúPush‚Äù is really Richie Foley, friend of Static. When Ragtag gave him his powers, he would not tell Static where they came from; but when Richie was forced to steal for Ragtag, he turned on Run and Jump and sounded the alarm. Static showed up and together they took Run and Jump down. =Replay= Replay/Johnny Morrow (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) was a child superstar, but as he got older, people forgot about him. When he was afflicted by the Big Bang gas, Johnny gained the ability to replicate himself, making stealing things and running from the cops incredibly easy. Replay is similar to Multiple Man from Marvel Comics. In a tangle with Static, Johnny accidentally replicates Static instead of himself. With this Static clone, Johnny takes Static for a \\"crime spree\\" across Dakota, framing Static in the process. Static eventually discovers what's going on and puts a stop to Replay with the help of Richie, who put the fight between Static and his clone live on air, publicly revealing the duplicity. Note: Replay's former career as an out-of-work child star may be a reference to Harris' previous role on the live action sitcom Doogie Howser, M.D.. =Tantrum= Whenever Thomas Kim (voiced by John Cho) gets angry or upset, he transforms into the ‚ÄúTantrum‚Äù, a purple- skinned, muscular, and violent metahuman that will destroy and wreak havoc on those he was angry at. Similar to Marvel's Hulk, Tantrum is ironically violent, strong, unintelligent, and sturdy; he is Thomas' polar opposite, like Bruce Banner is to the Hulk. They also both have contempt for their alter ego as when Static kept saying Tantrum was Thomas, he replied, \\"No. Not Thomas. Thomas weak.\\" Thomas first became Tantrum in a nearby restaurant, destroying the inside and hurling Static into a nearby elevator. The next day, after receiving a 99/100 on an essay from Mrs. Pettibone due to a typographical error, he attacked her in the school parking lot. Later Richie found Thomas' near-perfect essay in the parking lot, leading Virgil and him to suspect Thomas was Tantrum. They confront Thomas about this in his home. Feeling threatened, accused, and teased, Thomas got angry and sent them away, transforming into Tantrum just moments later. Back at the Hawkin's home, Richie and Virgil are watching some home movies, in particular one where baby Virgil is throwing a fit. His mother tells his sister \\"sometimes you've got to let them work through that crankiness.\\" Minutes later Tantrum arrives, breaking down the front door in the process, angry at them for accusing and teasing him. Virgil manages to distract him so Richie can escape. Virgil (now Static) leads Tantrum away from the inner parts of the city and into an abandoned amusement park. Still enraged, Tantrum began throwing equipment and debris with Static dodging and blocking but not attacking. Static was eventually able to ‚Äútire‚Äù Tantrum out by letting his rampage run its course without making his anger worse by attacking; by doing this, Tantrum reverted to his human form. Thomas' father seemed to raise his son for academic perfection. This is implied to cause social problems for Thomas, including stress and anger. After Static verifies that Thomas and Tantrum are the same person, he tells this to Mr. and Mrs. Kim, so that Thomas can get help for his problems. Static got Tantrum to calm down near an amusement part as he tells the police that he \\"had a tantrum.\\" It is unknown if Thomas was one of the Bang Babies that was exposed to the Bang Baby cure (and, if he was, reinfected again). =Specs and Trapper= Specs and Trapper (voiced by Patton Oswalt and Michael Rosenbaum) are two villains Static encounters in Static Shock. They are upperclassmen in the Vanmoor Institute of Science who contemptuously pride themselves of being much smarter than anyone else. In \\"The New Kid\\", Specs and Trapper, on the orders of Edwin Alva, tell the students to build an electronic eye to track static electricity; in actuality, they plan to use these devices to track Static down, using a giant robot they control. However, they are defeated, and as a consequence, they seek revenge on Static. Much later in \\"Trouble Squared\\", they are hired by Edwin Alva Sr. to help restore his petrified son, but Specs and Trapper have other ideas; to effect their revenge on Static, they use the technical facilities to construct special equipment and adopt super-villain personas: Specs becomes Spectral (armed with a head visor which can discharge energy blasts, different colors having different effects (similar to the powers of the DC comics character, Halo, of the Outsiders)) and Trapper becomes Speedtrap (armed with a pair of gauntlets which can fire blasts of speed-manipulation force (the left controls deceleration and the right causes acceleration), causing targets to speed-up or slow-down, unable to control themselves, especially if they are it by a blast from both gauntlets). After they capture Static, however, Alva fires them because he is no longer primarily interested in capturing his enemy, and because of their causing damage to some of the equipment that was to be used in Alva Jr.'s restoration in their attempt to recapture Static after Static broke free. So Specs and Trapper hit upon a new plan: destroy Edwin Alva's son. At the end, Static saves Alva's son. Specs and Trapper are arrested for kidnapping and the news report states that they are old enough to be tried as adults. Some time later in \\"Where the Rubber Meets the Road\\" Specs and Trapper have gone truly renegade. They pay a Bang Baby, called Tarmack, to steal a state-of-the-art cold fusion engine from Alva Industries (as they're also looking for revenge on Alva Sr.). They plan to hold the city for ransom. They turn on Tarmack out of greed (having rebuilt their former arsenal (Specs with energy-blasting (sun)glasses, and Trapper with gloves that produce and control flexible string able to entangle targets)), and in the middle of a fight with Static, Gear, and Rubber-Band Man, Tarmack makes off with the cold fusion engine. In the end, Static and Gear defeat Specs and Trapper by disabling their gadgets, while Rubber-Band Man subdues Tarmack and disables the unstable fusion engine. It remains unknown what became of them since. =Replikon= Replikon (voiced by Coolio) is a metamorph with the ability to change his appearance at will and alter his molecular structure. Jealous of his friend's success, Replikon terrorized Rubber-Band Man about his record deal with A.J. McLean. Repilkon captured A.J. and posed as him to get a deal signed with Replikon instead of Rubber-Band Man. His plan was eventually revealed, and Static took Replikon down. The character's overall visual design is clearly based on Coolio, who also voices the character. He was never seen again. =Starburst= Starburst (voiced by David Faustino) is one of the new villains on the show. His real name is Brandon. A disgruntled employee of Bernie Rast, Starburst attempted to sabotage Bernie's new reality TV show with Static and Gear. With his knowledge of technology, Starburst was able to create a device that absorbed Static's powers and after it was activated, humiliated him on TV. In addition, he also rode a star-shaped platform similar to Static's platform. Static and Gear eventually discovered the source to Starburst's powers, were able to disable his suit by destroying the device on Static, and reveal to Bernie Rast who it really was that was defeating them on his new reality show. When Bernie learns of this, Brandon told Bernie that he needed the money to start his own TV project. Starburst was taken to jail and has not been heard from since. On a related note, Virgil read an article to Richie that Starburst had learned how to create that technology at a Science Camp. He never appeared again. =Anansi's enemies= Anansi's enemies are based on an ancient legend; the story, as told by Anansi, was that a clever Spider wanted to be able to tell stories, and the \\"Sky Spirit\\" king of all the lands agreed to give the spider what he wanted if he captured three troublemakers: Onini the Python, Osebo the Leopard, and the Mmoboro Hornet. The Spider trapped Mmoboro in a gourd, tied Onini to a stick, and dug a pit and covered it with leaves, then lured Osebo into it. The Sky Spirit thanked the spider and granted its wish, giving it the ability to tell stories through the power of making illusions. Osebo Osebo (voiced by Michael Jai White) is a large humanoid leopard with a metal fist. At first sight, everyone mistakes Osebo for a tiger as he has stripes instead of spots; everyone who has ever heard that he is a leopard wonders why he has stripes. Anansi himself told Static in \\"Out of Africa,\\" \\"I too often wonder about the stripes.\\" It is still unknown why Osebo has stripes. Osebo first encountered Static in \\"Static in Africa\\" when he and Anansi fought him at the time when Osebo plotted to blow up the Akosoko Dam. In \\"Out of Africa,\\" Osebo later showed up in Dakota with his associates in a plot to obtain the Ashanti Gold Spider. Mmoboro Mmoboroi (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is a giant hornet who can turn into a swarm of smaller wasps. Onini Onini (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is a giant black python with snake-headed hands and a snake tail instead of legs. =Crewcut= Crewcut (voiced by Charles Rocket) is a shady mercenary hired by Ashton Biotechnics. He was instructed to capture Dr. Jonathan Vale and Dr. Delores Vale who had taken their experiment away from the company and raised it as their own. Hearing news about She-Bang, Crewcut put two and two together and figured out that She-Bang was the experiment that he was after. While he did managed to catch She-Bang, Static and Gear later defeated Crewcut who was arrested by the FBI. =Doctor Odium= Doctor Odium (voiced by David Ogden Stiers) is a mad scientist who is an expert in bio-tactical artificial intelligence and robotics. He used to work for the NBA until he turned traitor when the government won't let him test his nanites on humans. After perfecting his nanites, Doctor Odium used them to extort the NBA into giving him a ransom of $100,000,000.00 or else he will unleash his nanites. In one of his nanites' attacks, one of them managed to capture Gear. With help from the Hoop Squad, Static tracked down Gear and fought the nanites. When the Doctor Odium they defeated was actually a nanite, the real Doctor Odium was hiding in a cryo-tube. =Heavy Man= Heavy Man/Dr. Koenig (voiced by Ron Perlman) was a scientist at Ashton Biotechnics who worked with She-Bang's parents on a project involving cell matter absorption. The project was canceled, but Heavy Man remained using himself as a test subject. The results were strength and the ability to absorb non-living matter, but a gruesome look as well. Worse, he was going to become as heavy as a statue and unable to move. So he kidnapped She-Bang's parents and threatened to poison them with the poison in their collars if they did not help him make an antidote. They devised the antidote, but he had absorbed so much matter at this time, it did not get through his thick skin. He left them to die, but Static, Gear, and She-Bang intervened. While Static fought him, Gear and She- Bang freed her parents. He was beaten when he absorbed too much matter while fighting Static, which accelerated the process and made him too heavy to move. He was last seen being taken away by government officials as Static and Gear hope that someone will find a cure for him. =Professor Menace= Professor Menace (voiced by Terence Stamp) is a mad scientist and an old enemy of Soul Power whose spectacles can shoot lasers. He mostly used his robots to do his bidding. While Professor Menace was thought dead after his base self- destructed in 1963 following his last fight with Soul Power, he resurfaced years ago, claiming that he placed himself in cryogenic stasis. Static helped Soul Power fight Professor Menace and his robots when he began to use his weather-control machine plot again. He trapped Static and Soul Power in order to use them as batteries. Both of them managed to break free and were joined by Soul Power's former sidekick Sparky. When Professor Menace's latest hideout is beneath the retirement home where Soul Power resides, Static, Sparky, and Soul Power fought Professor Menace. Thanks to a charge from Static and Sparky, Soul Power used his powers to disable Professor Menace's spectacles. With it being revealed to have the illusion that made Professor Menace look young, Soul Power discovered that Professor Menace was actually a grumpy retirement home resident named Dennis, who stated that all those years, he'd waited and planned his revenge against Soul Power, and Soul Power still won; he then adds that he should've stuck to basket weaving at the retirement home. =Speedwarp= Speedwarp (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is a villain who is able to move very quickly. His real name is Eddie Felson. He was called \\"Weird Eddie\\" and was known as \\"the nerd who all the other nerds would pick on\\", according to Static. Eddie knew Virgil and Daisy from a science camp and developed an obsessive crush on her. After getting an internship at a laboratory, he steals a device called the Time Gauntlet which allows the wearer to move so quickly it appears that the world is standing still. Ever since he use the device, he became sadistic, obsessive, and willing to kill others to get what he wants. Besides using his new power for thievery and offers to steal gifts for Daisy, he also discovered Gear's and Static's identities with it by deducing that Static was Virgil after unmasking Gear while in hypertime. When his colleague Dr. McDonald discovers this, he leaves a message on Eddie's answering machine that he had seen security footage of him stealing the Time Gauntlet and advises him to turn himself over to the authorities immediately. With the Time Gauntlet, Speedwarp uses it to reclaim the security footage Dr. McDonald was going to turn over to the cops and tries to attempt murder by sabotaging the airplane he was on (which Static and Gear stopped). Now Speedwarp became a fugitive. Gear designs a one-time use device for Static that mimics the Time Gauntlet's affects. Speedwarp uses the Time Gauntlet to crash the B2K concert to get to Daisy which caused Daisy to be afraid, but ended up fighting Static. When Speedwarp touches Static's device, it had the effect of causing him to move extremely slow and now he can't expose the duo's identities. Static later had the police pick him up, but were told not to rush for he now moved slower than a snail as it will be Christmas by the time he makes it to the other corner of the street. It remains unknown what happened to him after the events of the episode, thought it's most likely that he was taken to be treated and being sent to jail for the crimes he committed. =Tarmack= Tarmack (voiced by John DiMaggio) is one of the characters in the series that originated from the 93-97 Milestone comic book series, making his first appearance in Static issue# 3. Tarmack would also appear in an issue of Blood Syndicate and Icon, as well as the My Name is Holocaust miniseries. Revealed in the comics, Tarmack's real name was Charles Bell. After the Big Bang, Bell became a large man of living hot tarmac. As such, Tarmack is as strong and as tough as tar, able to pummel his way through any obstacle, and is also able to project heat energy to melt obstacles. He is highly vulnerable to water. Like his comic book incarnation, Tarmack was a character with low intelligence and this element was carried on to his animated portrayal in Where the Rubber Meets the Road; where at intervals throughout the episode, other characters made fun of Tarmack's slow wits and how easily he was talked into doing a job for Specs and Trapper for so little money. When he was recruited by Specs and Trapper to steal a device from Edwin Alva, Tarmack decided he wanted the ransom money. Unfortunately for him, Static and Gear interfered, leaving the ransom money to never arrive. Tarmack's powers are similar to DC's Clayface, and his appearance is similar to Magma from Batman Beyond. =Omnara= Omnara/Dr. Karen Roberts (voiced by Wendie Malick) was the head of Edwin Alva's project to find Static‚Äôs secret identity and expose him, but her funding was pulled when Alva lost interest in the project following the revival of his son. Angry with Alva for going back on his word to fund her other project, she found out Static‚Äôs identity herself and hired Puff and Onyx to capture Robert Hawkins as blackmail, forcing him into stealing the components she needed for her project back from Alva Industries. Though she initiated the project successfully, Static was able to stop Omnara‚Äôs plan of controlling every computer in the world via a virus with the help of an anti-virus created by Gear. She was last seen being carted away by the paramedics, her brain having \\"crashed\\" because of the anti-virus. Other characters * Frieda Goren (voiced by Danica McKellar) - Virgil's friend at school and his initial crush. Though lively and popular in school, she tends to be short-tempered and impulsive, earning her the nickname \\"Hurricane Frieda\\". She is an active participant and the driving force of the school's newspaper. The animated Frieda is made as only a supporting character, as opposed to her comic counterpart, in which she plays Gear's role as Virgil's best friend/confidant/and unofficial sidekick to his Static persona. * Daisy Watkins (voiced by Crystal Scales) - A girl that had attended an academy for the gifted (Vanmoor Institute) in which she met Virgil. After the events involving two of her fellow students as the culprits, she enrolls in the same school as Virgil, Richie and Frieda. Virgil has a crush on Daisy (although in the first episode, Frieda was the girl he liked). * Sean Foley (voiced by Dan Lauria) - Richie's father. A tough, blue-collar man. In the Season 1 episode Sons of the Fathers, it is revealed that Mr. Foley is a racist who dislikes African-Americans. At the end of the episode though, Mr. Foley apologizes having realized that his racism is ruining his relationship with his son, and resolves to change his ways. * Maggie Foley (voiced by Jean Smart) - Richie's mother. She appears in \\"Sons of the Fathers\\" as a rather quiet, soft-spoken woman. She is also shown to be open-minded, as she likes Virgil and encourages his friendship with Richie. * Edwin Alva (voiced by Kerrigan Mahan) - One of the richest men in America (according to Richie, he \\"makes Bill Gates look like he's homeless\\"). In \\"Junior,\\" he is shown to be neglectful and contemptuous of his son Edward Alva Jr. This caused Alva Jr. to use the Bang Baby gas to gain different superpowers and ruin his father's company. During the final confrontation with Static, Alva Jr. inadvertently transforms himself into stone due to a power overload making Edwin Alva Sr. feel guilty that he hurt his son and drove him to it. Edwin Alva's motivation from then on revolves around curing his son. In \\"Trouble Squared,\\" Edwin Alva has Specs and Trapper assist in the project that would restore Edwin Alva Jr. from his petrified state. Instead, the two worked on catching Static which they succeeded in only to be scolded by Edwin Alva who told them that they were supposed to help in restoring his son. Specs and Trapper's fight with Static damaged the restoration machine enraging Edwin Alva enough to fire Specs and Trapper. The two later retaliated by capturing Edwin Alva Jr. causing Edwin to obtain Static's help. After Edwin Alva Jr. was rescued and Specs and Trapper are arrested, Edwin Alva donated a large check to Robert Hawking's children center. The second attempt to restore Edwin Alva Jr. occurs in \\"No Man's an Island\\" when Edwin Alva orchestrates the captures of Static, Hot-Streak, Gear, Talon, and Rubberband Man in order for his scientists to siphon their energies for the restoration machine. When it came to the episode's climax, Static and Hot-Streak donated their energy to the machine which then restored Edwin Alva's son. His appearance resemble Michael Douglas's character Gordon Gecko from Wall Street, and creator Dwayne McDuffie has said that the character was supposed to have been \\"more Peter O'Toole than Peter Fonda\\". * Mayor of Dakota (voiced by CCH Pounder) - The unnamed Mayor of Dakota and a good friend of Edwin Alva who worked to keep Alva Industries from being discredited. While she is modeled after Thomasina Jefferson from Milestone Comics, she is not referred to by her name. * Dakota Police Department - The police organization in Dakota. They have a Metahuman Containment Unit that is used to arrest metahuman criminals.  Barnsdale (voiced by Dennis Haysbert) - The Dakota Police Department's chief of police.  Trina Jessup (voiced by Sheryl Lee Ralph) - Trina Jessup is a police officer at the Dakota Police Department. Appearing in only 2 episodes in season 2 (\\"Pop's Girlfriend\\" and \\"Consequences\\"), Trina is Robert Hawkins' new romantic love interest and girlfriend. Despite it being their idea for their father to get back out into the dating scene, Sharon and Virgil did not warm- up to her, especially in Virgil's case over a misunderstanding after Virgil flees from her when she and her partner had stopped him out on the street while they were out on patrol and had asked to search his backpack (where Virgil had his Static costume), following theft by a Dakota High School student of samples of Bing-Bang gas. They were able to make peace after the real culprits were caught. She never discovers that Virgil is Static and was dropped after season 2.  Kim Garcia (voiced by Nestor Carbonell) - A police officer and the partner of Trina Jessup.  Packard (voiced by Frank Welker) - A police officer who investigated Monster's attacks. He previously arrested Marcus Reed during an earlier assignment.  Rojas (voiced by Gustavo Rex) - A police officer and Packard's partner who investigated Monster's attacks. * Bernie Rast (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) - A sleazy, loud-mouth TV producer who always looks out for a big hit to promote his clients, and by extension, himself. * Shelly Sandoval (voiced by Maria Canals-Barrera) - A young news reporter in Dakota who regularly reports on the metahuman activities in town. * Principal Aguilar (voiced by Miguel Sandoval) - The principal of Dakota Union High School. He dislikes it when students cause trouble in his halls. * Mr. McGill (voiced by Phil LaMarr) - Virgil's and Richie's algebra and physics teacher at Dakota Union High School. He usually talks with a drawling tone, rendering his students unable to concentrate on his lectures. * Jimmy Osgood (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz) - An unstable boy who is a student at Virgil's school and is constantly bullied by Nick Connor, alongside his goons Kevin and Ray. This leads him to steal his father's gun and threaten Nick with it. At first, he seems to surrender after Richie calms him down. However, Kevin and Ray tackle him, and the gun accidentally goes off and shoots Richie in the leg, causing Jimmy to have a mental breakdown. Afterwards, Jimmy receives psychiatric treatment while Nick, Kevin, and Ray get suspended from school and sentenced to community service. * Jonathan Vale (voiced by Phil Morris) - A scientist and former worker at Ashton Biotechnics who helped to create Shenice who they raised as their own. * Dolores Vale (voiced by Pamela Tyson in the first appearance, Kimberly Brooks in the third appearance) - A scientist, former worker at Ashton Biotechnics, and wife of Jonathan who helped to create Shenice who they raised as their own. * Donald Todd (voiced by Ed Begley Jr.) - A scientist at GenomaTech who worked on a cure for all Bang Babies under the orders of the governor.

It lies on the coast of the Bay of Biscay, from the French border. The capital city of Gipuzkoa, the municipality's population is 186,095 as of 2015, with its metropolitan area reaching 436,500 in 2010.Proyecto Audes. Locals call themselves donostiarra (singular), both in SpanishDonostiarra. Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola. and Basque. The main economic activities are commerce and tourism, and it is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Spain. Despite the city's small size, events such as the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival have given it an international dimension. San Sebasti√°n, along with Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, was the European Capital of Culture in 2016. Etymology In spite of appearances, both the Basque form Donostia and the Spanish form San Sebasti√°n have the same meaning of Saint Sebastian. The French name for the city is Saint-S√©bastien. The dona/done/doni element in Basque place-names signifies \\"saint\\" and is derived from Latin domine; the second part of Donostia contains a shortened form of the saint's name.Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 There are two hypotheses regarding the evolution of the Basque name: one says it was *Done Sebasti√°ne > Donasa(b)astiai > Donasastia > Donastia > Donostia, Koldo Mitxelena: Apellidos vascos, 1955, page 96. the other one says it was *Done Sebastiane > *Done Sebastiae > *Done Sebastie > *Donesebastia > *Donasastia > *Donastia > Donostia. ¬´Donostia-San Sebasti√°n: Onom√°stica¬ª, Au√±amendi Eusko Entziklopedia. Geography Map of San Sebasti√°n The city is located in the north of the Basque Autonomous Community, on the southern coast of the Bay of Biscay. San Sebasti√°n's three beaches, Concha, Ondarreta, and Zurriola, make it a popular resort. The town is surrounded by easily accessible hilly areas: Urgull (adjacent to the old part of the city), Mount Ulia (extending east to Pasaia), Mount Adarra (south of the city) and Igeldo (overlooking Concha Bay from the west). The city sits at the mouth of the River Urumea, Donostia was built to a large extent on the river's wetlands over the last two centuries. In fact, the city centre and the districts of Amara Berri and Riberas de Loiola lie on the former bed of the river, which was diverted to its current canalized course in the first half of the 20th century. =Climate= San Sebasti√°n features an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) with warm summers and cool winters. Like many cities with this climate, San Sebasti√°n typically experiences cloudy or overcast conditions for the majority of the year, typically with some precipitation. The city averages roughly of precipitation annually, which is fairly evenly spread throughout the year. However, the city is somewhat drier and noticeably sunnier in the summer months, experiencing on average approximately of precipitation during those months. Average temperatures range from in January to in August.

The unearthed remains, such as carved stone used as knives to cut animal skin, date from 24,000 to 22,000 BC. The open-air findings of the Upper Paleolithic have revealed that the settlers were hunters and Homo sapiens, besides pointing to a much colder climate at the time. Article in Spanish =Antiquity= There were Roman settlements (from around 50-200 AD) in what is now the Old Part of the city, according to excavations carried out in the convent of Santa Teresa, on the slopes of Urgull.Unsain, J.M. (2008): San Sebasti√°n, ciudad mar√≠tima. San Sebastin: Museo Naval , 164-7 San Sebasti√°n is thought to have been in the territory of the Varduli in Roman times. east of the current city lay the Basque Roman town of Oiasso (Irun), which was for a long time wrongly identified with San Sebasti√°n. =Middle Ages= After a long period of silence in evidence, in 1014 the monastery of St. Sebasti√°n with its apple orchards (for cider), located in the town of Hernani, is donated to the Abbey of Leire by Sancho III of Pamplona. By 1181, the city is chartered (given fuero) by king Sancho VI of Pamplona on the site of Izurum, having jurisdiction over all the territory between the rivers Oria and Bidasoa. In 1200, the city was conquered by Castile, whose king Alfonso VIII, confirmed its charter (fuero), but the Kingdom of Navarre was deprived of its main direct access out to the sea. Perhaps as soon as 1204 (or earlier), the city nucleus at the foot of Urgull started to be populated with Gascon-speaking colonizers from Bayonne and beyond, who left an important imprint in the city's identity in the centuries to come. In 1265, the use of the city as a seaport is granted to Navarre as part of a wedding pact. The large quantity of Gascons inhabiting the town favoured the development of trade with other European ports and Gascony. The city steered clear of the destructive War of the Bands in Gipuzkoa, the only town in doing so in that territory. In fact, the town only joined Gipuzkoa in 1459 after the war came to an end. Up to the 16th century, Donostia remained mostly out of wars, but by the beginning of the 15th century, a line of walls of simple construction is attested encircling the town. The last chapter of the town in the Middle Ages was brought about by a fire that devastated Donostia in 1489. After burning to the ground, the town began a new renaissance by building up mainly with stone instead of bare timber. =Modern Age= The advent of the Modern Age brought a period of instability and war for the city. New state boundaries were drawn that left Donostia located close to Spain's border with France; thicker and more sophisticated walls were erected, with the town becoming involved in the 1521‚Äì1524 military campaigns that formed part of the Spanish conquest of Navarre. The town provided critical naval help to Emperor Charles V during the siege of Hondarribia, which earned the town the titles \\"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\\", recorded on its coat of arms. The town also aided the monarch by sending a party to the Battle of Noain and providing help to quash the Revolt of the Comuneros in 1521. After these events, Gascons, who had played a leading role in the political and economic life of the town since its foundation, began to be excluded from influential public positions by means of a string of regional sentences upheld by royal decision (regional diets of Zestoa 1527, Hondarribia 1557, Bergara 1558, Tolosa 1604 and Deba 1662). Meanwhile, the climate of war and disease left the town in a poor condition that drove many fishermen and traders to take to the sea as corsairs as a way of getting a living, most of the times under the auspices of the king Philip II of Spain, who benefited from the disruption caused to and wealth obtained from the French and Dutch trade ships. In 1660, the city was used as the royal headquarters during the marriage of the Infanta to Louis XIV at Saint-Jean-de- Luz nearby. After a relatively peaceful 17th century, the town was besieged and taken over by the troops of the French Duke of Berwick up to 1721. However, San Sebasti√°n was not spared by shelling in the French assault and many urban structures were reconstructed, e.g. a new opening in the middle of the town, the Plaza Berria (that was to become the current Konstituzio Plaza). In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded and boosted commerce with the Americas. Thanks to the profit the company generated, the town underwent some urban reforms and improvements and the new Santa Maria Church was erected by subscription. This period of wealth and development was to last up to the end of 18th century. In 1808, Napoleonic forces captured San Sebasti√°n in the Peninsular War. In 1813, after a siege of various weeks, on 28 August, during the night, a landing party from a British Royal Navy squadron captured Santa Clara Island, in the bay. Situated on a narrow promontory that jutted out into the sea between the waters of the Bay of Biscay and the broad estuary of the Urumea River, the town was hard to get at and well fortified ‚Äì \\"it was the strongest fortification I ever saw, Gibraltar excepted\\", wrote William Dent.L. Woodford (ed.), A Young Surgeon in Wellingtons Army: the Letters of William Dent (Old Woking, 1976), p. 39. Three days later, on 31 August, British and Portuguese troops besieging San Sebasti√°n assaulted the town. The relieving troops ransacked and burnt the city to the ground. Only the street at the foot of the hill (now called 31 August Street) remained. =Contemporary history= After these destructive events, reconstruction of the city was commenced in the original location with a slightly altered layout. A modern octagonal layout as drafted by the architect P.M. Ugartemendia was turned down and eventually M. Gogorza's blueprint was approved, then supervised and implemented by the Ugartemendia. This area, the old town, has a neoclassical, austere and systematic style of architectural construction. Constitution Square was built in 1817 and the town hall (currently a library) between 1828 and 1832. Housing in the old town was built gradually alongside the rest of the area. The liberal and bourgeois San Sebasti√°n became the capital of Gipuzkoa (instead of Tolosa) until 1823, when absolutists attacked the town again (only 200 inhabitants remained in the town when the offensive troops entered). It was designated again as the capital in 1854. In 1833, British volunteers under Sir George de Lacy Evans defended the town against Carlist attack, and those who died were buried in the English Cemetery on Mount Urgull. At the beginning of the 19th century, the local government was still ruled by the principle of nobility, while inhabitants of foreign origin or descent had always been ubiquitous in the town, especially among the trading community. Although San Sebasti√°n benefited greatly from the charter system established in the Southern Basque Country (foruak, with borders in the Ebro river and no duties for overseas goods), the town was at odds with the more traditional Gipuzkoa, even requesting secession from the province and annexation to Navarre in 1841. In 1863, the defensive walls of the town were demolished (their remains are visible in the underground car park on the Boulevard) and an expansion of the town began in an attempt to move on from its previous military function. Jose Goicoa and Ramon Cortazar were appointed to oversee the work. They modelled the new city according to an orthogonal shape in a neoclassical Parisian style, and Goicoa designed several elegant buildings, such as the Miramar Palace and La Concha Promenade. The city was chosen by the Spanish monarchy as a summer retreat following the French example of nearby Biarritz, and Spanish nobility and the diplomatic corps opened residences in the town. As the \\"wave baths\\" at La Concha were in conflict with nearby shipbuilding activity, the shipyards relocated to Pasaia, a nearby bay that had formerly been part of San Sebasti√°n. However, in 1875, war came to the town again, and in 1876 shelling over the city by Carlists claimed the life of acclaimed the poet Bilintx. From 1885, King Alfonso XII of Spain's widow Maria Cristina spent every summer in Donostia along with her retinue, staying at the Miramar Palace. In 1887, a casino was built, which eventually became the current city hall, and some time later the Regional Government building was completed in Plaza Gipuzkoa following Jose Goicoa's design. Cultural life thrived in this period, giving rise to various events still popular in the city, such as the Caldereros or the Tamborrada, and journalistic and literary works in both Spanish and Basque. After much debate in the city over whether to pursue an economy based on tourism or manufacturing, Donostia developed into a fully-fledged seaside resort, but some industry developed in the district of Antiguo and on the outskirts of the city. Following the outbreak of World War I, San Sebasti√°n became a destination for renowned international figures of culture and politics, including Mata Hari, Leon Trotsky, Maurice Ravel, and Romanones. San Sebastian was one of earliest towns hit by the 1918 Influenza epidemic, dealing with a first wave outbreak in February of that year. Officials feared for the city's reputation and attempted to keep the disease's spread quiet, to no avail, and the outbreak soon spread throughout Spain. Various rationalist architectural works, typically white or light-coloured, were built in the 1920s and 1930s, such as La Equitativa, Nautico, and Easo. In 1924‚Äì1926, canalisation work was carried out on the Urumea river at the southern edge of the city. However, after the city's Belle Epoque in the European wartime, repression under Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorship was not favourable for the city. In 1924, gambling was prohibited by the authoritarian regime, causing existential problems for the Grand Casino and the Kursaal (1921). In 1930, Spanish republican forces signed up to the Pact of San Sebasti√°n, leading to the Second Spanish Republic. Unrest and repression did not stop with the new political regime, and large-scale industrial action was called several times by the growing anarchist, communist and socialist unions. The 1936 military coup was initially defeated by the resistance, led by the Basque Nationalists,Hugh Thomas (2001). Spanish Civil War. anarchists and communists, but later that same year the province fell to Spanish Nationalist forces during the Northern Campaign. The occupation proved disastrous for the city's residents. Between 1936 and 1943, 485 people were executed as a result of show trials by the Spanish Nationalists (Requet√©s and Falangists). It has been estimated that extrajudicial executions (paseos) by the occupying military forces accounted for over 600 murders in the area during the first months of occupation. Many children were evacuated to temporary safety in Bilbao, with the city's population falling by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants. In the aftermath of war, the city was stricken by poverty, famine and repression, coupled with a thriving smuggling trade. Many republican detainees were held at the beach-side Ondarreta Prison in grim and humid conditions, until the building was demolished in 1948. However, industrial development paved the way for urban expansion in the Egia and Amara Berri districts, on the marshes and riverbed of the Urumea, at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s. In 1943, the first Basque language schools were established by Elvira Zipitria, who taught in Basque from her home in the Old Town. In 1947, the Grand Casino was converted into the City Hall. In 1953, city businessmen organised the first San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival to stimulate the economic life and profile of the city. Mass immigration from other parts of Spain, spurred by growing industrial production, greatly increased the population, initiating rapid and chaotic urban development on the outskirts of the city (Altza, Intxaurrondo, Herrera, Bidebieta), yet social, cultural and political injustices followed, setting the scene for popular dissatisfaction. A general climate of protest and street demonstrations followed, driven by Basque nationalists (especially the armed separatist organisation ETA) and various underground unions, triggering the first state of emergency in Gipuzkoa in 1968. Several more were imposed by the Francoist authorities in the period immediately preceding Franco's death in 1975. Amid the fragile economic situation and real estate speculation, the Kursaal and the Chofre bullring in Gros were demolished in 1973. From 1975‚Äì77, sculptor Eduardo Chillida and architect Luis Pe√±a Ganchegui's landmark The Comb of the Winds was built at the western tip of the bay. The 1970s to the mid-1980s were years of general urban and social decay marked by social and political unrest and violence. In 1979, the first democratic municipal elections were held, won by the Basque Nationalist Party, who held office along with splinter party Eusko Alkartasuna (Basque Solidarity) until 1991. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's Odon Elorza took over as mayor from 1991 until 2011, when he was defeated unexpectedly by Juan Carlos Izagirre (Bildu) in elections. From the 1990s, a major makeover of the city centre began, aimed at enhancing and revamping the neoclassical and modernist side of San Sebasti√°n's architecture. Other regeneration projects included the reshaping and enlargement of Zurriola beach and promenade, the opening of the Kursaal Palace cubes (1999), the new university campus and technology facilities in Ibaeta, the creation of a wide network of cycle lanes, underground car-parks and significant improvements to public transport. Districts of cutting-edge design have been erected, such as Ibaeta and Riberas de Loiola, while some other major public works are still pending confirmation of funding and approval. Districts of the city Monuments of the city Fa√ßade of the Constitution Square (Plaza) in San Sebasti√°n As a result of Donostia's sprawling in all directions, first into the flatlands shaped by the river Urumea and later up the hills, new districts arose after the walls of the city were demolished in 1863. The first expansion of the old town stretched out to the river's mouth, on the old quarter called Zurriola (a name later given by Council decision to the sand area and the avenue across the river). The orthogonal layout nowadays making up the city centre (the Cortazar development) was built up to 1914 (first phase finished) much in tune with a Parisian Haussmannian style. The arcades of the Buen Pastor square were fashioned after the ones of the Rue de Rivoli, with the Maria Cristina Bridge being inspired by the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine. The Estaci√≥n del Norte train station standing right across the bridge was inaugurated in 1864 just after the arrival of the railway to San Sebasti√°n, with its metallic roof being designed by Gustave Eiffel. Donostia's central bus station is located underground adjacent to the train station. =Parte Vieja / Alde Zaharra= The Parte Vieja (Spanish) or Alde Zaharra (Basque) ‚Äî Old Town ‚Äì is the traditional core area of the city, and was surrounded by walls up to 1863, when they were demolished so as to occupy the stretch of sand and land that connected the town to the mainland (a stretch of the walls still limits the Old Part on its exit to the port through the Portaletas gate). The Old Town is divided in two parishes relating to the Santa Maria and San Vicente churches, the inhabitants belonging to the former being dubbed traditionally joxemaritarrak, while those attached to the latter are referred to as koxkeroak. Historically, the koxkeroak up to the early 18th century were largely Gascon speaking inhabitants. Especially after the end of Franco's dictatorship, scores of bars sprang up all over the Old Part which are very popular with the youth and the tourists, although not as much with the local residents. Most current buildings trace back to the 19th century, erected thanks to the concerted effort and determination of the town dwellers after the 1813 destruction of the town by the allied Anglo-Portuguese troops. Book in Spanish There is a small fishing and recreation port, with two-floor houses lined under the front-wall of the mount Urgull. Yet these houses are relatively new, resulting from the demilitarization of the hill, sold to the city council by the Ministry of War in 1924. City hall of San Sebasti√°n San Sebasti√°n's Cathedral Mar√≠a Cristina Bridge Miramar Palace Zurriola Bridge and mouth of the Urumea =Antiguo= This part stands at the west side of the city beyond the Miramar Palace. It is arguably the first population nucleus, even before the land at the foot of Urgull (Old Part) was settled. A monastery of San Sebasti√°n el Antiguo ('the Old') is attested in documents at the time of the foundation (12th century). At the mid 19th century, industry developed (Cervezas El Le√≥n, Suchard, Lizarriturry), the nucleus coming to be populated by workers. Industry has since been replaced by services and the tourist sector. The Matia kalea provides the main axis for the district. =Amara Zaharra= Or Old Amara, named after the farmhouse Amara. It has eventually merged with the city centre to a large extent, since former Amara lay on the marshes at the left of the River Urumea. The core of this district is the Easo plaza, with the railway terminal of Euskotren closing the square at its south. =Amara Berri= This city expansion to the south came about as of the 1940s, after the works to canalize the river were achieved. Nowadays the name Amara usually applies to this sector, the newer district having overshadowed the original nucleus both in size and population. The district harbours the main road entrance to the city. Facilities of many state run agencies were established here and presently Amara's buildings house many business offices. The district revolves around the axis of Avenida Sancho el Sabio and Avenida de Madrid. =Gros= The district is built on the sandy terrain across the river. The Gros or Zurriola surf beach by the river's mouth bears witness to that type of soil. In the 19th century, shanties and workshops started to dot the area, Tomas Gros being one of its main proprietors as well as providing the name for this part of the city. The area held the former monumental bullring Chofre demolished in 1973, on a site currently occupied by a housing estate. The district shows a dynamic commercial activity, recently boosted by the presence of the Kursaal Congress Centre by the beach. =Aiete= One of the newest parts in the city, it kept a rural air until not long ago. The postwar city council bought the quaint compound of the Aiete Palace for the use of Francisco Franco in 1940, right after the conclusion of the Civil War. The place in turn became the summer residence for the dictator up to 1975. Nowadays home to the Bakearen Etxea or Peace Memorial House. =Egia= Egia, stemming from (H)Egia (Basque for either bank/shore or hill), is a popular district of Donostia on the right side of the Urumea beyond the train station. At the beginning of the 20th century, a patch of land by the railway started to be used as a football pitch, eventually turning into the official stadium of the local team Real Sociedad before it was transferred in the 1990s to Anoeta, south of Amara Berri (nowadays the site harbours houses). The former tobacco factory building Tabakalera, which has been converted into a Contemporary Culture Centre, conjures up the former industrial past of the area,. Right opposite to this building lies the Cristina Enea park, a public compound with a botanic vocation. Egia holds the city cemetery, Polloe, at the north-east fringes of the district, stretching out to South Intxaurrondo. =Intxaurrondo= This part (meaning 'walnut tree' in Basque) is a large district to the east of the city. The original nucleus lies between the railway and the Ategorrieta Avenue, where still today the farmhouse Intxaurrondo Zar, declared \\"National Monument\\", is situated since the mid-17th century. The railway cuts across the district, the southern side being the fruit of the heavy development undergone in the area during the immigration years of the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, further housing estates have been built up more recently souther beyond the N-1 E-5 E-80 E-70 ring road (South Intxaurrondo). The police force Guardia Civil runs controversial barracks there (works for new housing are underway). =Altza= Altza (Basque for alder tree) is the easternmost district of San Sebasti√°n along with Bidebieta and Trintxerpe. It was but a quaint village comprising scattered farmhouses and a small nucleus a century ago (2,683 inhabitants in 1910), yet on the arrival of thousands of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s a rapid and chaotic housing and building activity ensued, resulting in a maze of grey landscape of skyscrapers and 32,531 inhabitants crammed in them (data of 1970), the figure is 20,000 . =Ibaeta= Ibaeta stands on the former location for various factories (e.g., Cervezas El Le√≥n) of San Sebasti√°n, with the buildings of the old industrial estate being demolished in the late 20th century. The levelling of this large flat area paved the ground for a carefully planned modern and elegant housing estate, featuring a new university campus for the public University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU) and institutions such as the Donostia International Physics Center or the Nanotechnology Center. A stream called Konporta flows down along the eastern side of the area, but it was canalized under the ground almost all along to its mouth on the bay pushed by urban building pressure. =Loiola= It lies by the Urumea at the south-east end of the city. It comprises a small patch of detached houses (Ciudad Jard√≠n) and a core area of 6-odd floor buildings. The district has recently gone through a major makeover, with works finishing in 2008. The road axis coming from important industrial areas (Astigarraga-Hernani) crosses the district heading downtown. A military base stands across the river, home to an uprising in 1936. Attempts by the city council to close it have been unsuccessful so far. =Riberas de Loiola= New modern district erected in the 2000s next to the city's inner bypass and south road entrance to Donostia. A pedestrian bridge spans the Urumea river onto the Cristina Enea Park. =Martutene= The Martutene district bordering to the south on the town of Astigarraga comes next to Loiola in the south direction. This part of the city features an industrial area, a football pitch for lower leagues, a disused vocational training building and enclosure as well as a prison, much in decay and due to be transferred soon to a new location, probably in the municipality's exclave of Zubieta, while this option is coming in for much opposition. =Ulia= Former tank supplying the city with sanitary water in Ulia This part stands on the east side of the city at the foot of the Mount Ulia Park, on the left hand side of the road heading from Donostia to Pasaia and Irun. It consists of a residential area, besides holding a number of educational institutions, culture and sports centres built since 1980. The Park of Nurseries of Ulia sits at the base of the road leading to Mount Ulia, with its name deriving from its function as a nursery of plants for the public gardens of Donostia during all the 20th century and until 2008. It includes two ancient water- tanks, architectonic elements, and specific flora and fauna. =Zubieta= The exclave Zubieta (meaning 'place of bridges') was a village up to recent years, with a number of houses, a handball pitch (on account of its single wall as opposed to the regular two) and a church. Yet it has undergone a great urban development, which has rendered the location a built-up area with paved streets and due equipment. Two contested projects are under way to build a solid-waste incinerator and a prison nearby. Historically, neighbours from Donostia held a meeting at a house in the former village in the wake of the 1813 burning, in order to decide the reconstruction of the town. Culture and events San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival, Red Carpet San Sebasti√°n shows a dynamic cultural scene, where grass-roots initiative based on different parts of the city and the concerted private and public synergy have paved the ground for a rich range of possibilities and events catering to the tastes of a wide and selected public alike. The city was selected as European Capital of Culture for 2016 (shared with Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) with a basic motto, \\"Waves of people's energy\\", summarizing a clear message: people and movements of citizens are the real driving force behind transformations and changes in the world. Events ranging from traditional city festivals to music, theatre or cinema take place all year round, while they specially thrive in summer. In the last week of July, San Sebasti√°n's Jazz Festival (Jazzaldia), the longest, continuously running Jazz Festival in Europe is held. In different spots of the city gigs are staged, sometimes with free admission. The Musical Fortnight comes next extending for at least fifteen days well into August and featuring classical music concerts. In September, the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival comes to the spotlight, an event with more than 50 years revolving around the venues of Kursaal and the Victoria Eugenia Theatre. The city is also home to the San Telmo Museoa, a major cultural institution with an ethnographic, artistic and civic vocation. Sticking to the cinematic language but lacking its echo, Street Zinema is an international audiovisual festival exploring contemporary art and urban cultures. Other rising and popular events include the Horror and Fantasy Festival in October (21st edition in 2010) and the Surfilm Festibal, a cinema festival featuring surfing footage, especially shorts. During centuries, the city has been open to many influences that have left a trace, often mingling with the local customs and traditions and eventually resulting in festivals and new customs. =San Sebasti√°n Day= Tamborrada, children's section Every year on 20 January (the feast of Saint Sebastian), the people of San Sebasti√°n celebrate a festival known as the \\"Tamborrada\\". At midnight, in the Konstituzio plaza in the \\"Alde Zaharra/Parte Vieja\\" (Old Part), the mayor raises the flag of San Sebasti√°n (see in the infobox). For 24 hours, the entire city is awash with the sound of drums. The adults, dressed as cooks and soldiers, march around the city. They march all night with their cook hats and white aprons with the March of San Sebasti√°n. On this day a procession was held in the early 19th century from the Santa Maria Church in the Old Part to the San Sebasti√°n Church in the district of Antiguo, while later limited on the grounds of weather conditions to the in- wall area. The event finished with a popular dancing accompanied on the military band's flutes and drums. In addition, every day a soldier parade took place to change the guards at the town's southern walls. Since the San Sebasti√°n Day was the first festival heralding the upcoming Carnival, it's no surprise that some youths in Carnival mood followed them aping their martial manners and drumrolls, using for the purpose the buckets left at the fountains. In the period spanning the 1860s and 1880s the celebrations started to shape as we know them today with proper military style outfits and parades and the tunes fashioned by music composer Raimundo Sarriegui. Adults usually have dinner in txokos (\\"gourmet clubs\\"), who traditionally admitted only males, but nowadays even the strictest ones allow women on the \\"Noche de la Tamborrada\\". They eat sophisticated meals cooked by themselves, mostly composed of seafood (traditionally elvers, now no longer served due to its exorbitant price) and drink the best wines. For \\"Donostiarras\\" this is the most celebrated festival of the year. =La Semana Grande/Aste Nagusia= giants and big-heads in the Semana Grande/Aste Nagusia A festival, La Semana Grande in Spanish and Aste Nagusia in Basque (\\"The Big/Main Week\\"), is held every year in mid-August. A major international fireworks competition is held during the festival, in which teams representing various countries and cities put on a fireworks display each night over the bay, with the winner of the contest announced at the end. The displays are sometimes accompanied by a full live orchestra performing on the boardwalk. Attendees often claim spots along the beach and bay hours in advance. The festival also includes a parade of marching bands, stilted entertainers, and big-heads costumes every afternoon. =Basque Week= This decades long festivity taking place at the beginning of September features events related to Basque culture, such as performances of traditional improvising poets (bertsolaris), Basque pelota games, stone lifting contests, oxen wagers, dance exhibitions or the cider tasting festival. Yet the main highlight may be the rowing boat competition, where teams from different towns of the Bay of Biscay contend for the Flag of La Concha. Thousands of supporters coming from these coastal locations pour into the city's streets and promenades overlooking the bay to follow the event, especially on the Sunday of the final race. All day long the streets of the Old Part play host to droves of youths clad in their team colours who party there in a cheerful atmosphere. =Santa Ageda Bezpera= Saint Agatha's Eve is a traditional event taking place at the beginning of February or end of January in many spots of the Basque Country. It holds a small but cherished slot in the city's run-up to the Carnival. Groups dressed up in Basque traditional farmer costume march across the neighbourhood singing and wielding a characteristic stick beaten on the ground to the rhythm of the traditional Saint Agatha's tune. The singers ask for a small donation, which can be money, a drink or something to eat. =Caldereros= View of the harbour This is a local festival held on the first Saturday of February linked to the upcoming Carnival, where different groups of people dressed in Romani (Gypsy) tinkers attire take to the streets banging rhythmically a hammer or spoon against a pot or pan, and usually bar-hop while they sing the traditional songs for the occasion. They were just male voices some time ago, but women participate and sing currently too, and the main event is at the City Hall, where the city band plays marches while the crowds bang the pots and pans. The festival began in 1884. =Santo Tomas= The Santo Tomas festival takes place on Thomas the Apostle's day, 21 December. From the early morning, stalls are erected around the city centre, and visitors from across Gipuzkoa come to the centre and the Old Part, many dressed in traditional Basque \\"farmer\\" outfits. Traditional and typical produce is sold from the stalls; the main drink is cider and the most popular snacks are txistorra, a thin, uncured chorizo wrapped in talo flatbread. A large pig is displayed in Plaza Constitucion, which is raffled off during the festival. =Olentzero= As in other Basque cities, towns and villages, on Christmas Eve the Olentzero and the accompanying carol singers usually dressed in Basque farmer costume take over the streets, especially in the city centre, asking for small donations in bars, shops and banks after singing their repertoire. Sometimes Olentzero choirs roam around the streets in later dates, on the 31st for example, and are often related to cultural, social or political associations and demands. Economy and industry The main economic activities are commerce and tourism. San Sebasti√°n is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Spain. The international technology organisation Ikusi is based in San Sebasti√°n. Transport The city is served by Euskotren Trena, the main Basque rail operator. Euskotren Trena operates trains to Bilbao and other destinations, as well as the Metro Donostialdea and Cercan√≠as San Sebasti√°n within the San Sebasti√°n metropolitan area. There are frequent trains via San Sebasti√°n railway station from Madrid to Hendaye in France, which is connected to the French rail network. The city is also served by San Sebasti√°n Airport in the nearby municipality of Hondarribia. San Sebasti√°n Airport currently has no international destinations. Biarritz Airport in France is located about 50 km from San Sebastian. Gastronomy Jam√≥n serrano and pintxos in one of the numerous bars of the Old Quarter Donostia is renowned for its Basque cuisine. San Sebasti√°n and its surrounding area is home to a high concentration of restaurants boasting Michelin stars including Arzak (San Sebasti√°n), Berasategi (Lasarte), Akelarre (district Igeldo) and Mugaritz (Errenteria), to mention but a few. It is the city with the second most Michelin stars per capita in the world, only behind Kyoto, Japan. Additionally, based on the 2013 ranking, two of the world's top ten best restaurants can be found here. Adding to these cooking highlights, the city features tasty snacks similar to tapas called pintxos, which may be found at the bars of the Old Quarter. It is also the birthplace of Basque gastronomical societies, with the oldest recorded mention of such a txoko back in 1870. In addition, it boasts the first institution to offer a university degree in Gastronomy, Basque Culinary Center.  University  Donostia-San Sebasti√°n has become an important University town. Four universities and a superior conservatory are present in the city: *University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU): San Sebasti√°n hosts the Gipuzkoa Campus of the public university. *University of Navarra: The private university has an engineering- centered campus, Tecnun, in San Sebasti√°n. *Universidad de Deusto: Built in 1956, the San Sebasti√°n campus of the private university offers different university degrees. *Mondragon University: The pioneering Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences of this private university is located in San Sebasti√°n. *Musikene: The Higher School of Music of the Basque Country is located in San Sebasti√°n. The secondary studies activity is having an increasing impact on social, cultural, technological and economical levels of the city and surroundings. With its pushing innovative and research centers and its research strategies it is becoming one of Spain's main Science production locations, along with Barcelona, Madrid, Bilbao, Seville and Valencia, among others. Donostia-San Sebastian's Scientific production covers areas like Materials Science, Cancer Research, Alzheimer and Parkinson, Architecture, Polymer Science, Biomaterials, Nanotechnology, Robotics or Informatics.  Sport  Surf in Donostia-San Sebasti√°n The principal football club in the city is Real Sociedad. After three seasons in the Segunda Divisi√≥n, the club won promotion back to La Liga after winning the 2009‚Äì10 Segunda Divisi√≥n. Real Sociedad was one of the founding members of the top division in Spanish football, La Liga. They enjoyed a particularly successful period of history in the early 1980s when they were Spanish champions for two years running (1980‚Äì81, 1981‚Äì82). In May 2019, Real Sociedad's female team won the Queen's Cup for the first time. The city's Anoeta Stadium located at the Anoeta Sports Complex is home to the Real Sociedad and also hosts rugby union matches featuring Biarritz Olympique or Aviron Bayonnais. Each summer the city plays host to a well known cycling race, the one-day Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n (\\"San Sebasti√°n Classic\\"). Cycling races are extremely popular in Spain, and the Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n professional is held during early August. It has been held annually in San Sebasti√°n since 1981. The race is part of the UCI World Tour and was previously part of its predecessors UCI ProTour and UCI Road World Cup. A women's version of the race has been held since 2019.

Tercel was named after the \\"tercel\\", the male of various hawks, especially of the peregrine falcon and the goshawk. Tercel was laid down on 16 May 1944 by the American Ship Building Company, Lorain, Ohio; launched on 16 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. H. Thompson; and commissioned on 21 August 1945, Lt. Comdr. M. Dent, Jr., USNR, in command. East Coast operations  Following trials in Lake Erie, Tercel headed for the Atlantic via the Great Lakes waterway and the St. Lawrence River. She arrived at Boston on 7 September and was outfitted. Sailing on 2 November, Tercel reached Little Creek, Virginia, the next day for her shakedown cruise. Tercel was assigned to Mine Forces, Atlantic Fleet, on 1 January 1946, when that organization was activated. She stood out of Norfolk, Virginia, a week later and conducted exercises in the Chesapeake Bay until 21 March. In April, she was assigned to the Mine Warfare School at Yorktown, Virginia, and supported that establishment until 2 July 1946. The minesweeper conducted local operations and participated in exercises along the eastern seaboard from the Caribbean to New London, Connecticut.  Assignment to the Mediterranean  On 20 July 1951 when she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina. Tercel stood out of Charleston in early September 1951 for her first deployment to the Mediterranean. While there, she called at Gibraltar and ports in Italy, France, Malta, and Greece. Upon her return to Charleston on 6 February 1952, she resumed her normal U.S. East Coast routine. Operation Dew I Operation Dew I was a Chemical, Biological, Radio-logical (CBR) warfare experiment. Dew I consisted of five separate trials from 26 March 1952 until 21 April 1952 that were designed to test the feasibility of maintaining a large aerosol cloud released offshore until it drifted over land, achieving a large area coverage (LAC).U.S. National Research Council, Subcommittee on Zinc Cadmium Sulfide. Toxicologic Assessment of the Army's Zinc Cadmium Sulfide Dispersion, (Google Books), National Academies Press, 1997, pp. 44‚Äì77, (). The tests released zinc cadmium sulfide along a line approximately off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Two of the trials dispersed clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide over large areas of all three U.S. states. The tests affected over 60,000 square miles (150,000 km2) of populated coastal region in the U.S. southeast.http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5739&page;=122Toxicologic Assessment of the Army's Zinc Cadmium Sulfide Dispersion, p. 74. The Dew I releases were from a Navy minesweeper, the .  Second Mediterranean assignment  Tercel was again deployed to the Mediterranean from 21 April to 26 October 1953. Then, after approximately eight months of operations in home waters, the minesweeper was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet for a preinactivation overhaul.  Decommissioning  The ship was placed out of commission, in reserve, at Orange, Texas, on 10 November 1954. On 7 February 1955, she was redesignated MSF-386 and reclassified a steel-hulled fleet minesweeper. Tercel was struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1972.  Fate  The Naval Vessel Register lists Tercel as \\"Disposed of, type of disposal not known\\" and has a note saying: \\"Presumed scrapped date unknown\\", this is incorrect, she was not scrapped. Tercel was used as a Salvage Training Hulk from 1972‚Äì1988. She was sunk as a target on 6 April 1988, being towed to the target area by the USS Grapple (ARS-53).http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/g/ars-53/1988.pdf References  * External links   Ships of the U.S. Navy, 1940‚Äì1945 AM-386 USS Tercel Category:Auk-class minesweepers of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Lorain, Ohio Category:1944 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United States ","title":"USS Tercel (AM-386)"},{"id":"11178714","text":"Erhan Ku≈ükapan (born June 8, 1988 in Yenimahalle, Turkey) is a Turkish footballer.

It was written by John Howard Palevich, originally for his undergraduate thesis while at MIT. Dandy is one of the first games to offer simultaneous, four-player, cooperative play. It was the direct inspiration for the popular 1985 Atari Games coin-op, Gauntlet, and later turned into the Dark Chambers home game published by Atari Corporation. In 1986, Electric Dreams Software published versions of Dandy for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC. This was after the release of Gauntlet, and these versions of Dandy are visually closer to the arcade game than the Atari 8-bit original. The name Dandy is a play on D&D;, the common abbreviation for Dungeons & Dragons. Gameplay Screenshot Dandy takes place in a maze-like dungeon, seen from an overhead view. The dungeon has multiple levels, connected together using stairwells. Portions of the mazes are blocked by locked doors, which can be opened with keys scattered through the maze. The goal of the game is to fight through the maze to the next stairwell, from there to the next level, and proceed through the dungeon's levels to the end. The players are armed with a bow and arrow which can be shot in any of the eight cardinal directions. Monsters come in several varieties, though the differences are strictly graphical. When hit, the monsters \\"devolve\\" to the next less-powerful state, before eventually being killed and disappearing. Some monsters are placed in the maze during its pre-game creation and appear as soon as that level is entered, while others are produced in skull-shaped monster generators. Monsters touching the player reduce the player's health, which can be improved by eating food scattered around the dungeon. Potions destroy all monsters on the screen when activated. Potions can be either shot with an arrow, or picked up and carried for later use. A special \\"heart of gold\\" can also be collected to revive dead party members. Players interact with the game primarily through the joystick, although some key-presses are used for eating food or using potions. With two or more players, the screen scrolls according to the average location of the group to encourage cooperation. History =Thesis of Terror= The game that eventually became Dandy had been originally written in the fall of 1982 as Thesis of Terror, Jack Palevich's MIT bachelor's thesis. The original concept was for a five-person game, four players on Atari computers acting as graphical terminals, and a fifth machine acting as dungeon master controlling the action from a separate computer. The two machines would communicate over their serial ports. However, time constraints meant that the interactive dungeon master role was never implemented. The separate machine, a Hewlett-Packard Pascal Workstation (a member of the HP 9000 family), was used solely as a file server, sending new maps to the Atari on demand. The game engine was inspired by John Conway's Game of Life. Life is cellular automata; at each \\"turn\\" the game examines the squares on the grid that makes up the playfield, and uses a basic calculation to determine whether or not that square should hold a cell. In Dandy this same basic mechanism is used, but the decision was essentially \\"if the player is on that side of the cell, and there is a monster on the other side, then I will hold a monster on the next turn.\\" This gave the illusion of the monsters chasing the player, when in fact they did not move at all. Like a marquee, the motion was an illusion as they simply turned on or off. This algorithm was easy to implement using the limited resources of the Atari 800; it takes the same time to run no matter how many monsters were currently in the map. It also has the property that any dungeon that could be drawn in the editor will run correctly and efficiently, the designer does not have to worry about \\"correct\\" placement of the monsters or generators to ensure the map would. The gameplay design of Thesis of Terror was heavily influenced by Dungeons & Dragons; Palevich had never actually played D&D;, but he had read through the manuals and watched some of his dorm-mates play campaigns in the lounge of MIT's New House II dormitory. The new name Dandy is a play on the phonetic pronunciation of D and D, which at the time was a generic term for dungeon adventure role-playing games. Dandy was also influenced by the Defender arcade game, which contributed the idea of the smart bomb (potions), and by several maze-exploration arcade games that contributed the idea of using keys to unlock doors. Dandy was not influenced by any of the roguelike games, as Palevich was unaware of Rogue at the time Dandy was designed. Thesis of Terror's gameplay was designed with help from Joel Gluck, who was a freshman at MIT at the time. Gluck designed several of the levels in the game, and invented some of the common idioms of Dandy-style games. For example, he designed the \\"funnel trap\\", where treasure was placed in such a way that the players would run to the treasure, causing a wall of monsters placed just off screen to activate and charge on the party. Several changes were made to the gameplay as a result of playtesting. Early versions of the game allowed players to shoot each other, but this was removed after testing showed that when the players discovered that they could hurt each other, the game quickly degenerated into a chaotic free-for-all. Another change was that dead players originally had to sit out the rest of the game. Testing revealed that parties would start the game over when one member died, so that the whole party could continue to play together. To keep the game going, the revival heart was added. =Creation of Dandy= After graduating from MIT, Palevich went to work for Atari in the Atari Research division. He helped design the operating system for the unreleased Atari Sierra personal computer. He worked on the Atari AMY sound chip which was never used in a shipping product.\\"Atari 65XEM\\", see \\"One of the original programmers of the AMY chips software was John Palevich...\\" While working at Atari, Palevich continued developing the game. During the period from February to May 1983, the original was cleaned up for release, and it was during this period that the name became Dandy. The workstation was removed, and the dungeon master's role was reduced to laying out the maps and saving them to floppy disk. Another change was to remove the ability to return to higher levels of the dungeon. This change was made after play-testing revealed that nobody ever went up to previous levels, except by mistake. Removing this feature sped up level changes, because the maze state no longer had to be written out to disk before the next level was loaded. It also enabled the game to work on cassette tape as well as on disk; on the tape version the cassette tape was stopped between levels, and then started up again to load the next level. Atari Program Exchange advertised Dandy as \\"the great new team game ... Bring up to three friends! Work as a team to battle monsters!\\", with a cartoon of four children exploring a dungeon. Legacy Typical Gauntlet scene, with treasure, monsters, and two monster generators Two years after Dandys release, Atari Games released Gauntlet, a project led by Ed Logg. During a speech given at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, Ed Logg said that Dandy served as direct inspiration for Gauntlet. In 1988, Atari Corporation released a Dandy- like game named Dark Chambers for the Atari 2600, Atari 7800, and Atari 8-bit family (with the packaging in the style of Atari XEGS games). The manual states \\"Copyright 1983 John Howard Palevich. All rights reserved.\\" It only supports two players and has many fewer on-screen enemies than either Dandy or Gauntlet.

The archive documents wills, financial transactions, and divorces of the Dryton household who lived in the Thebaid: specifically the cities of Ptolemais and Pathyris (see also Ptolemaic Egypt). Currently these documents are scattered amongst museum collections in the United States, England, France, Germany, and Egypt.Lewis, N: ‚ÄúGreeks in Ptolemaic Egypt‚Äù, pp 88‚Äì103. Oxford University Press, 1986 Contents The significance of this archive is that the documents seem to interchange between two languages in such a way that one may presume the entire household to be bilingual. Dryton was a cavalry officer in Ptolemais, a Greek city in Upper Egypt. It shows he was married to Sarapias by whom he had a son, Esthladas. They divorced and Dryton took his son with him in his transfer to Pathyris around 152 BCE. It was here he met his second wife Apollonia, also known by her Egyptian name of Senmonthis, who most likely was a teen, to his almost fifty years of age. Greeks in Ptolemaic Egypt only associated with other Greeks and did not interact with the natives; however, Dryton appears to have developed a more Egyptian lifestyle towards the end of his life with his marriage to Apollonia. Esthladas seems to have followed in his father‚Äôs footsteps and earned a living as a professional soldier and through private land ownership. He appears to have adapted to a more Egyptian way of life and was also both fluent and literate in the Egyptian language of Demotic and Greek as many of the later documents pertain to him specifically. He inherited the majority of land and assets following his father's death, but he shared some of this land with his stepmother and stepsisters.Lewis, N: Greeks in Ptolemaic Egypt, pp 88‚Äì103. Oxford University Press, 1986 Another focus for those who study this archive is on the relationships between mother and the five daughters (Apollonia/Senmouthis, Aristo/Semonthis, Aphrodisia/Takhratis, Nikarion/Thermouthis, Apollonia the Younger/Senpelaia) as a way to glimpse gender roles of both Greek and Egyptian families. In Dryton's last will in 126 BCE he states that: :\\"And to my wife Apollonia also called Senmonthis, if she stays home and is irreproachable, [his children] shall give every month for four years for the maintenance of herself and her two daughters 2¬Ω artabs of wheat, 1/12 of croton (genus), and 200 copper drachmas...Whatever property Senmonthis may have evidently acquired for herself while married to Dryton, she is to continue to own.\\"Pomeroy, S: ‚ÄúWomen in Hellenistic Egypt‚Äù, pp 106. Schocken Books, 1984 In addition to maintaining possession of land, Apollonia was also involved in lending money, which is seen in a number of documents that record her financial transactions. Her five daughters were all kept and raised which follows the Egyptian custom of no infanticide regardless of money or gender. This particular will also gives their daughters a small portion of the estate. He also provided dowry arrangements for Aristo and Aphrodisia. At this time his first daughter, Apollonia, appears to have been married, so she did not receive an additional sum of money. Nikarion and Apollonia the Younger were mere children and an amount of money was to be given them until they turned 17 or 18 years old. Overall, it seems that his will was fairly typical for a Greek citizen during the Hellenistic period.Pomeroy, S: ‚ÄúWomen in Hellenistic Egypt‚Äù, pp 103‚Äì123.

As an estuary, the bay is home to a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered whooping crane, and numerous finfish including the redfish as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from the bay. Copano Bay is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village and Holiday Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, and contribute to the livelihood of the local economies. Recently, areas around the bay were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over the bay as a Category 3 hurricane. History Copano Bay was inhabited by the nomadic Aransas Indians, who constructed camps along the shore, 4,000 years ago. The Aransas people left the area approximately 700 years ago, and were replaced around 1400 CE by the Copane Indians, for whom the bay is named. The Copane were one of five groups making up the Karankawas, hunter-gatherers who occupied the mid-Texas coast. Cabeza de Vaca is thought to have been the first European to sight the bay in the early 16th century, evidenced by the descriptions in his logs that match the detail of the area. In 1766, Spaniard Diego Ortiz Parrilla is believed to be the first European to explore the bay. He named it Santo Domingo (Saint Dominic), but it was later changed to Copano, after the port of Copano was officially opened in 1785 on the northwestern shore. The port later served as a strategically important locale during the Texas Revolution and the American Civil War, and was the site of a settlement that is now completely abandoned. The town of St. Mary's of Aransas was founded southwest of Copano and thrived as a port and wood mart, until numerous shipwrecks caused by the bay's hidden reefs concluded its use in 1875. Like Copano, it is now abandoned. Further to the southwest, at the mouth of the Aransas River, the town of Black Point was established in the 1840s. The site was attacked by Indians several times before the settlement was abandoned. However, it was reestablished in the early 20th century as the present-day city of Bayside. Bayside developers aimed to attract fruit and vegetable growers to the plots made available and advertised nationwide, but large amounts of land were purchased by speculators, raising demand and forcing further annexation. The 2000 census reported that 360 people lived in the city. The cities of Fulton and Rockport were established on Aransas Bay in the late 19th century, and later expanded development along most of the eastern shore of Copano Bay. Such developments include Copano Village, which registered 210 residents in 2000, and the 1,000 resident Holiday Beach community just west of Goose Island State Park on Lamar Peninsula. Features Piers off the eastern shore of Copano Bay with the shape of the bay on the horizon Copano Bay is approximately twelve-by-six-miles, oriented from the southwest to the northeast. It is found mainly on undeveloped land, though ranches are located on parts of the west, south and north shores. The main extensions include Mission Bay, which stretches to the north to the mouth of the Mission River, and Port Bay to the west, which forms the southern boundary of the Live Oak peninsula. The peninsula is located on the eastern shore of Copano Bay and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of Live Oak peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bay. This opening is spanned by the Copano Bay Causeway and the Copano Bay Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the mouth of Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost halfway across the bay. Further southwest, past the mouth of Mission Bay, Bayside stretches along the coast to the mouth of the Aransas River. The shoreline turns to the southeast from this point, past the Egery Flats and Egery Island through Swan Lake and to the mouth of Port Bay. The bay's maximum depth is , and in contrast to the Laguna Madre (approximately 80 miles down the coast to the south), is not hypersaline. The Mission and Aransas Rivers are the main freshwater sources: small rivers with deep banks that carve through a landscape lined with hardwood trees. Their inflows increase during significant rainfall and reach their seasonal highs during the autumn. These rivers have not been dammed and thus flow free. At both mouths, marshes covering several square miles stretch from the confluences with Copano Bay and forming several saline lakes. Ecosystem Copano Bay serves as a nursery for shrimp, which attracts a large number of redfish. Abundant collections of black drum, flounder and trout, can also be found in the bay. Oysters grow in large numbers to form elongated reefs \\"oriented perpendicular to tidal flow\\" in the estuary. The reefs provide habitat for fish and sustenance for a wide variety of birds including the black-bellied whistling-duck, black-necked stilt, brown pelican, gull-billed tern, reddish egret, roseate spoonbill, seaside sparrow, white-faced ibis and the whooping crane. The dominant species of gastropod in the bay is Eulimastoma harbisonae. In 2003, the United States Department of the Interior granted $574,000 to Texas Parks and Wildlife to purchase over of prime birding habitat at Egery Flats and the mouth of the Aransas River, to prevent further development. Industry Oil and natural gas wells are located both onshore and offshore of Copano Bay. Three oil and natural gas fields are found on the bay, including the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field, just west of Holiday Beach, the South Copano Bay Oil Field, just offshore from Bayside, and the West Fulton Beach Gas and Oil Field to the west of the Live Oak peninsula. In 1997, a pipeline owned by Koch Industries burst in the marsh in Refugio County, two miles (3 km) west of Copano Bay near the Aransas River, spilling 1,000 gallons of oil over a area. The oil did not seep into Copano Bay, preventing a minor environmental disaster. Copano Bay is off limits to shrimping due to its designation as a nursery bay.

He published a number of books, some of which he authored and some of which he translated from the Chinese. Arthur Reynolds was born in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, England, to Thomas Frederick Reynolds, boot clicker, and Edith Emily Reynolds, school teacher. He attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham. On leaving school Arthur Reynolds worked in the telephone section of the General Post Office before applying to the China Inland Mission (CIM) for work in China. He left for China on 29 September 1933 and after language training was sent to work in the province of Shanxi. The Second World War meant that he did not return to England for furlough until 1944. It was during this furlough that he went to Wellingborough, Northants, to speak at a missionary meeting and there met Joy Callis, only daughter of Henry and Rhoda Callis, who was to become his wife. After Reynolds returned to China, Joy Callis followed, sent as a missionary in her own right, also with CIM. They married in 1948 and settled in Chungking (now Chongqing) and two sons were born to them there, before the Communist advance forced them out of China and they went to work in Japan in 1952. Church-planting, evangelistic work was done in Anegasaki in a first term in Japan, during which a daughter and another son were born. Another daughter was born later in England. During the 1960s Arthur and Joy Reynolds were seconded for a while to the Central Japan Pioneer Mission (CJPM), before returning to work with OMF in Sapporo, where Arthur became principal of the Hokkaido Bible Institute and lectured in Homiletics, amongst other subjects. During these years he had published in Japanese a book called Sermon Preparation, and served as Vice-President of the Japan Evangelical Missionary Association (JEMA) and Assistant Editor of Japan Harvest, the quarterly magazine of JEMA. Arthur and his wife were forced into early retirement from missionary work in 1971 due to Arthur's angina. In retirement they settled in Wallington, Surrey. During retirement Reynolds was part-time Teacher and Chaplain at the Abbey Christian School (Abbey Road, London), a school for prospective missionaries to learn English as a foreign language, translated the writings of Chinese Christian leader Wong Ming-Dao and worked on his magnum opus, a book on preaching, which was finally published in 1997. Reynolds' wife, Joy, died in 1995 and he died in 2001.

Nullators are strange in the sense that they simultaneously have properties of both a short (zero voltage) and an open circuit (zero current). They are neither current nor voltage sources, yet both at the same time. Inserting a nullator in a circuit schematic imposes a mathematical constraint on how that circuit must behave, forcing the circuit itself to adopt whatever arrangements needed to meet the condition. For example, the inputs of an ideal operational amplifier (with negative feedback) behave like a nullator, as they draw no current and have no voltage across them, and these conditions are used to analyze the circuitry surrounding the operational amplifier. A nullator is normally paired with a norator to form a nullor. Two trivial cases are worth noting: A nullator in parallel with a norator is equivalent to a short (zero voltage any current) and a nullator in series with a norator is an open circuit (zero current, any voltage).

It attests to his military campaign into Nubia around the area of the 3rd cataract of the Nile. It was discovered around 1829, on a large boulder in Tombos, Nubia on the east bank of the Nile. Thutmose is known to have expanded Egypt‚Äôs borders throughout his reign, not only in Nubia, but also by campaigns in the Syria-Palestine area. During the Middle Kingdom, pharaohs such as Mentuhotep II had already expanded into Nubia. However, scholars argue that the Tombos stela is evidence of farther expansion by Thutmose into Nubia than previous kings.  Background  The Nile flows generally north through Africa, passing through Nubia into Egypt and eventually empties into the Mediterranean Sea. Along stretches of the river south of Egypt there are what are termed \\"cataracts\\". Cataracts are areas in the river where there are patches of rock, making the river dangerous and unnavigable by boat. These cataracts served as general boundary points for the Egyptian Empire, and often settlements and forts were constructed around these natural boundaries. Egypt‚Äôs natural boundary was in the area of the first cataract, just south of Aswan. The Nubian empire was Egypt‚Äôs historical enemy, with its territory spread throughout the areas of the second cataract, down into the area of Kush, and around the 4th and 5th cataracts around the area of Khartoum (Modern day Sudan). Around the time of the Second Intermediate Period Nubia seized land past its border with Egypt at the 1st cataract, almost wiping out Egypt‚Äôs empire. Egyptian Pharaoh Ahmose crushed the Nubian expansion and re-established Egyptian dominance by reunifying the empire while turning back the Nubians to the south.  The text  Two of the more prominently-used English versions of the text are those translated by scholars James Henry Breasted and Hans Goedicke. This article will use Goedicke‚Äôs translation. It reads as follows: > Year 2, 2d month of day 15 under the Majesty of Horus ‚Äúvictorious bull‚Äù law > loving; Nbty: who appears with Nsrt, great of strength; gold-horus: > beautiful of years, who enlivens the hearts, King, given life eternally, > Son-of-Re Thutmosis. In the 2d year that he was introduced: His appearance > as Chief of the two lands in order to rule what the sun disc has encircled, > South and also North , namely the parts of Horus and seth- uniting the Two > lands, as he sits on the thrones of Geb; Elevating the appearances of the > Shmty, Indeed as soon as his Majesty took possession of his heritage, he > ascended the dais of horus, concerning the widening of the borders of Thebes > and the measured plots of the West Side concerning the plain and hill > dwellers, even abominations-of god and restrained of locks work for her. > (Foreign) southerners are going north, (foreign) northerners are going > south; all foreigners are united their goods for the first occasion of the > ‚ÄúGood-god‚Äù hpr-ke-re [Thutmosis I], living eternally. Victorious is Horus, > the Lord of the two lands; After he tied the moving campaign to the landing > posts, the superiors and their villages belong to him in veneration, and the > skin-garbed are (either) dancing for His Majesty or are in respect for his > uraeus: After he overthrew the chief of the Nubians, the despoiled Nubian > belongs to his grip. After he had gathered the border markers of both sides, > no escape existed among the evil-of-character; those who had come to support > him-not one thereof remained. As the Nubian have fallen to terror and are > laid aside throughout their lands, their stench, it floods their wadis, > their blood is like a rainstorm.

The desired one of the Ennead > of gods of Karnak, given life, duration, luck, and health: he be joyous on > the Horus-throne, while leading all living ones like Re eternally.  Historical textual analysis  The text is written in poetic language, and the variations among the translations can lead to different interpretations.To see differences in translation, cf. Goedicke (1996) and Breasted (1906). In the search for corresponding evidence to support the validity of the Tombos stela, it is important to note that only Egyptian accounts are available. This inscription was a royal one glorifying the king and his exploits, not necessarily an inscription that is historical. This is seen in language that glorifies the king: \\"The son-of-re his beloved Thutmosis living forever and ever.\\" The author of the inscription must have had knowledge of Thutmosis' campaign. The text also reveals animosity towards Nubians. This is shown in the section: > After he overthrew the chief of the Nubians, the despoiled Nubian belongs to > his grip. After he had gathered the border markers of both sides, no escape > existed among the evil-of-character; those who had come to support him-not > one thereof remained. As the Nubian have fallen to terror and are laid aside > throughout their lands, their stench, it floods their wadis. From these passages it is shown that this stela was meant to glorify the king and his achievements. It was meant to be on display so people could see it and admire it. The language was meant to show Egyptian superiority over the enemies of Egypt. The king was obligated to uphold the order of maat, which is known as ‚Äútruth, order, and justice‚Äù and to destroy the enemies of Egypt. Whoever wrote the inscription may have been justifying the war in Nubia by describing Nubians as ‚Äúevil-ones‚Äù. In the text there is also a justification of the actions taken by Thutmosis I by the God Horus. Despite these interpretation of texts, it is important to note that there are different historical scholars who offer their interpretations on the Tombos stela.  Opinions of scholars  One of the more well-supported theories is argued by Louise Bradbury, who has posited that the Tombos stela provides evidence that Thutmose I expanded Egypt's control beyond the 3rd cataract of the Nile river, into an area south of Tombos called Kurgus, located just above the 4th cataract. Her first piece of evidence is an inscription found at a site called Hagar el-Merwa, around the 4th cataract in the area of Kurgus in Nubian territory . She notes that Hagar el-Merwa and the inscription found there can offer proof of an expansion by Thutmosis I into the area around the fourth cataract. Bradbury argues that the Tombos stela was carved after Thutmose‚Äôs return trip north from Hagar el-Merwa. Previously scholars argued that the Tombos stela described Thutmose‚Äôs expansion into the area of Nubia, as well as his expansion near the Euphrates (around modern day Iraq). This is because the river described in the stela was previously believed to be the Euphrates. Bradbury‚Äôs theory argues that the Tombos stela was a northern boundary marker for Thutmose‚Äôs expansion into Nubia and a description of his middle-east campaign. She argues that his Egyptian empire in Nubia stretched from the marker at Tombos, around the 3rd cataract, south towards Hagar el-Merwa around the 4th cataract. She does not argue that Thutmose‚Äôs encompassed Nubia, and the middle east at once. Bradbury argues that the ‚Äúinverted/circumvented water‚Äù phrase in the Tombos stela is actually a description of the Nile river in its natural change of direction. Around the area of the 4th cataract, the flow of the Nile shifts from northward to southward. This may have created some confusion for Egyptians traveling north from Nubia. Bradbury uses the source of Ahmose, son of Ebana to corroborate this evidence that the reference to ‚Äúbad water, or inverted water‚Äù means the area around the 4th cataract of the Nile. Ahmose son of Ebana, traveled with Thutmosis during his campaigns in Nubia. He writes of ‚Äúbad water‚Äù during their journey into Nubia. Bradbury argues that Egyptians chose to write about the bad water because while they were sailing north along the Nile around the area of the 4th cataract, the river changed course and they found themselves sailing south. This sudden change in direction may have confused Egyptians who had never traveled in the area before. Another scholar, Julia Budka, notes that there are many contemporary rock inscriptions found around the Tombos Stela. She maintains that these create a larger corpus of evidence on the story of the stela itself. These minor stela go in order from the large stela in the south and move north. They read as follows; ‚ÄúHorus Victorious Bull, Beloved of Maat, the good god [akh] hprkere [Thutmosis I] given life, who has stroken Kush [Nubia]... ‚ÄúThuthmosis, who appeared like Re [A God] given life; the Lord of Nubia‚Ä¶Victorious Bull‚Ä¶The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Lord of the Two lands, ahprkera [Thutmosis I] given life, the victorious ruler, who destroyed the Nubians.‚Äù Budka notes that these rock inscriptions all date to the 18th dynasty. These inscriptions provide evidence that Thutmosis had some sort of military expansion into Nubia, and support the conclusions about the Tombos stela. Budka agrees with scholar Louise Bradbury and her theory that the Tombos stela is evidence of an Egyptian expansion into Nubia during the reign of Thutmosis. Other scholars see religious significance in the Tombos stela and deny the theory that the ‚Äúinverted water‚Äù text is evidence for travel around the 4th cataract in Nubia.See Berg (1987) for disagreeing arguments, and Spalinger (1995) for the religious argument. There are scholars who disagree with the theory of Nubian expansion past Tombos, and offer evidence against the theory proposed by Bradbury.

A norator represents a controlled voltage or current source with infinite gain. Inserting a norator in a circuit schematic provides whatever current and voltage the outside circuit demands, in particular, the demands of Kirchhoff's circuit laws. For example, the output of an ideal opamp behaves as a norator, producing nonzero output voltage and current that meet circuit requirements despite a zero input. A norator is often paired with a nullator to form a nullor. Two trivial cases are worth noting: A nullator in parallel with a norator is equivalent to a short (zero voltage any current) and a nullator in series with a norator is an open circuit (zero current, any voltage).

The pilot also starred Nancy New and Fred McCarren as Elaine and Vance Keefer, a married couple in the year 2055. The plot of the episode revolves around Andy the robot's inadequacies as an older model, and whether or not they should replace him. Vance owns an antique store, and there are a lot of jokes that revolve around his misconceptions about the antiques he has, all of which are common household appliances of the 1970s. Vance is very frustrated by Andy's incompetence but eventually he and Elaine decide to keep him. Andy would revive the robot character to some degree in the 1981 film Heartbeeps.

The value is usually a statement which one side is attempting to achieve throughout the debate. In general, the side that best upholds his or her value premise, which was adequately defended, wins the debate. The value premise is sometimes referred to as the \\"value\\" or simply \\"vp\\". The value premise is not to be confused with the value criterion, which is the specific means of achieving the value premise. Purpose As Jason Baldwin explains in \\"Logic in LD\\", the value premise is \\"supposed to provide standards by which judges should evaluate subsequent arguments.\\"\\"Logic in LD\\" The value structure's purpose is to provide an overarching goal for both the affirmative and the negative to achieve. The value premise is not explicitly stated in the resolution, but many debaters use terms from the Lincoln-Douglas Debate resolution as their value premise. For example, the National Forensic League's November/December 2006 resolution stated: Resolved: A victim's deliberate use of deadly force is a just response to repeated domestic violence. In the instance, some debaters may use \\"justice\\" as the value premise for the round, because the resolution clearly establishes the objective of evaluating whether or not the use of deliberate force is just when facing domestic violence. Others tend to pick more uncommon values, mainly because commonly used value premises or value premises obtained from the resolution will be prepared for by other opponents, however, due to many resolutions question the morality or justice of certain actions, the value premise is most commonly agreed to be justice or some variant. The debate then centers on the Value Criterion, or the way of achieving or best maximizing the value. The value premise is intended to be a non-biased statement, which the arguments within the affirmative or negative constructive should support. Strategy The value premise may or may not be agreed upon throughout the entire debate by the affirmative and negative sides. Because the resolution does not explicitly state that a certain value premise must be used, debaters often must debate which value premise should be used to evaluate the round. In order to support the affirmative or negative side's value premise, debaters attempt to prove why their value premise is more relevant to the resolution, or why their opponent's value premise is inferior to their own. In some cases, debaters who have chosen common value premises may agree after presenting each side's constructive on what the value premise should be. Subsequently, both sides will try to uphold the same goal by way of their arguments, despite the fact they conflict. On the other hand, a debater may strategically purposely drop or choose not to defend his or her value premise if the other debater's value premise still may be achieved, or proven better, under the debater's own side. Criticism The current structure of Lincoln-Douglas Debate, under which both sides are expected to present a value premise as well as a value criterion to weigh the round, has been criticized for several reasons. As Jason Baldwin  the \\"winningest\\" LD debater in history  explains, \\"First, it is notoriously hard to say precisely how the value premise is related to the resolution and how the criterion is related to the value premise. Debaters often speak of the value premise as \\"supporting\\" the resolution or of the criterion as \\"fulfilling\\" the value premise, but it is hard to know just what these descriptions mean.\\"\\"Logic in LD\\" Additionally, many debaters who provide a kritik constructive choose to not uphold a value, but rather, criticize the resolution, the opposing side's rhetoric, or another part of the debate in order to affirm or negate the resolution. Subsequently, the \\"value\\" debate which Lincoln-Douglas is usually characterized as is altered.

His first treatise covers recorder playing: Opera intitulata Fontegara (Venice, 1535). His second (in two volumes) is about the viola da gamba: Regola Rubertina (Venice, 1542) and Lettione Seconda (Venice, 1543). They cover both technicalities of playing and the subtleties of expression. There is also guidance on ornamentation‚Äîpassaggi. The revival of interest in historically aware musical performance has resulted in renewed interest in Ganassi's writings. His treatises are now available in modern editions. Viol technique Ganassi's Regola Rubertina is among the earliest sources of advice to the viol player on how to hold the bow. In Chapter III, Ganassi says: > You know that the bow is to be held with three fingers, that is to say the > thumb, the index and middle fingers. The thumb and middle finger ensure, in > holding the bow, that it does not fall, and the index finger serves to > strengthen and stabilize it, keeping it on the strings and exerting more or > less pressure according to the need. The illustration from Regola Rubertina (lower right, opposite) appears to show this hold. Some interpretations of this passage conclude that the bow is to be held without touching the hair, whereas in later bow-holds the fingers tension the hair in order to allow louder or accented playing without the stick of the bow hitting the string. In a later passage, however, Ganassi makes it clear that the hair may be tensioned with the fingers in at least some circumstances, for example when playing chords to accompany a song: > I can say that if you wished to play a piece which is in four or five parts > while singing the fifth, you would need to use a longer bow than is > customarily used. This is because the hairs on a longer bow would be less > stretched, allowing one to draw the bow with less pressure on the strings > while playing a chord. Then you could use the fingers to stretch the hairs > when playing fewer strings or a single string.

It is a very distinct species and derives its name from the great prolongation and narrowness of the middle pair of tail-feathers, which is particularly noticeable in the male. Sprig was laid down on 15 February 1944 by the American Ship Building Company at Lorain, Ohio; launched on 15 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. John Sherwin; and commissioned on 4 April 1945, Lt. Thomas W. Cross in command. East Coast operations  On 15 April, the minesweeper started down the Saint Lawrence Seaway from Cleveland, Ohio. After stops at Montreal, Quebec, and Halifax, she arrived at Boston on 5 May. There she executed her first minesweeping trials and had her sound gear and depth charge equipment removed. She put to sea on 16 July and reached Hampton Roads, Virginia, the next day. Sprig conducted shakedown training at Little Creek, Virginia, until 6 September when she got underway for the Pacific. She was in the Panama Canal Zone from 12 to 14 September; then headed via Acapulco, Mexico, to San Pedro, California, arriving there on the 24th. Pacific Ocean operations  After almost two weeks on the U.S. West Coast, Sprig continued west on 6 October and made Pearl Harbor on the 20th. On the 31st, she sailed from Pearl Harbor bound for the western Pacific. She stopped briefly at Eniwetok and Saipan and made Wakayama, Japan, on 28 November. For the next five months, Sprig participated in the major minesweeping operation conducted in the immediate postwar period. In December 1945, she swept mines in the Tsushima Strait. She conducted minesweeping practice and sweeping operations at Tachibana Wan, Ky≈´sh≈´, in January 1946. Sprig moved to Shanghai, China, in February and returned to Sasebo, Japan, on 2 March. Later that month, the minesweeper began duty as courier ship, carrying mail and supplies to United States ships on station in the waters between Japan and Korea. In April, she herself took up one such station, relieving , then later in the month. Her commanding officer served as Commander, CTU 96.6.3, until 26 April, supervising minesweeping operations at Saishu To, off the southern coast of Korea. Reassignment to East Coast operations  On the 26th, she headed back to Sasebo and, on 1 May, got underway to return to the United States. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 17 to 25 May and made San Pedro, California, on the 31st. On 7 June, she sailed south toward the Panama Canal as OTC of a unit composed of , , and . She transited the canal and departed Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, on 20 June. On the 27th, she entered Charleston, South Carolina, and reported for duty to the Commander, Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet (COMINLANT). For the next eight years, Sprig served COMINLANT, sailing the length of the Atlantic seaboard and into the Caribbean at times. During this period, she was home ported at Charleston. Decommissioning  In June 1954, Sprig was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Orange, Texas. On 7 February 1955, Sprig was reclassified a fleet minesweeper, MSF-384. After 18 years with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Sprig's name was struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1972.

Both of these men held the position of consul into the year 89 BC due to their success during the campaigning season of the following year.Salmon, E.T. (1958). Notes on the Social War. Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 89: 159-184  Success in Battle  Papius achieved great success as the leader of the Samnite army during his advance into Roman territory. One of the more famous battles fought by the southern rebels occurred at the city of Nola. The Samnite army captured the city with 2,000 Roman soldiers remaining inside. The soldiers did not accept Papius' offer to serve under him and were therefore starved to death. Following his victory at Nola, Papius took the cities of Stabiae, Minervium, and Salernum while conquering the country around Nuceria. The citizens of these cities and those surrounding feared the wrath of Papius. He gathered the prisoners and slaves from each city while also being given infantry and cavalry out of fear (these troops amounted to over 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry). Papius continued to destroy the Romans while continuing to have success in the city of Campania and the regions surrounding it. During his leadership of the Samnite army, Papius only lost two notable battles. These were to consul Lucius Julius Caesar in 90 BC and to Cornelius Sulla Felix in 89 BC. Following his loss to Sulla, Papius is said to have been granted Roman citizenship. Shortly after, he was proscribed and committed suicide.Hornblower, Simon; Antony Spawforth [1996].

The film was Clarke's first feature;Experimental director Shirley Clarke on her film about drug addiction ‚Äì archive, 15 June 1961FilmThe Guardian she had made several short films over the previous decade. Jack Gelber wrote the screenplay, adapting his play of the same name. The film was the subject of significant court cases regarding censorship. Plot A title card announces that the film is a result of found footage assembled by cameraman J.J. Burden working for the acclaimed documentary filmmaker Jim Dunn, who has disappeared. Leach, a heroin addict, introduces the audience to his apartment where other heroin addicts, a mix of current and former jazz musicians, are waiting for Cowboy, their drug connection, to appear. As the men grow increasingly nervous, waiting for their fix, some of them start to address the camera directly. Although director Jim Dunn asks his camera operator J.J. to turn off the camera, J.J. films him coaching the junkies to \\"act natural\\" and revealing where the microphones and lights are hidden in the apartment. Furthermore, Jim reveals that he is the one who has given the addicts the money for their heroin in exchange for being able to film them. Jim, who is nervous around the junkies, confesses a private hope that he will be able to film the connection behind the connection. The junkies shoot down this idea and suggest it would be more interesting to watch Jim take heroin. J.J. suggests that Jim start with marijuana, which Leach finds amusing and does not even have. Cowboy finally arrives, bringing with him an older woman called Sister Salvation who has no idea what they are up to. The men shoot up one by one in the bathroom. Under pressure from the other men, who claim Jim is exploiting them, Jim agrees to try heroin. He almost immediately becomes ill from the effects, which are much stronger on him than on the others. Despite this, Jim continues to film the others encouraging them to act more cinematic and telling Cowboy he once thought of making him the \\"hero\\" of his film. Despite the fact that Cowboy injected Leach with heroin, Leach claims to not be high. Annoyed, Cowboy gives Leach the heroin and allows him to shoot up himself which he does in full view of J.J. However this final shot proves too much for Leach and Leach overdoses, but Cowboy manages to revive him Leach continues to have a bad trip. The men who are left wait for their next connection to show up. Meanwhile, Jim turns to J.J. and tells him that the film belongs to him and goes to join the other addicts in waiting. Background Based on the play The Connection by Jack Gelber, the film follows a young filmmaker who attempts to film junkies waiting for their heroin dealer to arrive. Most of the actors from the original stage production reprised their roles for the film: Warren Finnerty as Leach, Carl Lee as Cowboy, Garry Goodrow as Ernie, Jerome Raphel as Solly, Barbara Winchester as Sister Salvation, and Henry Proach as Harry. All the musicians from the original stage production appeared: Freddie Redd (composer, piano), Jackie McLean (alto sax), Michael Mattos (bass), and Larry Ritchie (drums). Non- original cast members James Anderson and William Redfield took the roles of Sam and Jim Dunn. The character of Jaybird was cut from the film, that role essentially shifted to a largely off-screen camera operator, J.J. Burden, voiced by Roscoe Lee Browne. The film helped to loosen film censorship, as Clarke and producer Lewis Allen had filed suit to be able to show the film in New York. (The film had premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1961.) In that era, in New York, the State's Department of Education had a vote on the State's film licensing board, and they voted to deny a license, mainly on the grounds that the word \\"shit\\" was used repeatedly during the film even though it was mostly used to refer to drugs. The case went to the New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest court). The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the intermediate level Appellate Division, which had held that while 'vulgar', this usage could not be considered obscene. Ultimately, the film was unsuccessful at the box office.

He was born in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex. He was the oldest of four siblings. During his youth he earned scholarships to Wellington College in Berkshire and to Trinity, Cambridge, from which he graduated in 1907 ranked as Sixth Wrangler. A year following his graduation he became an assistant at the Khedivial Astronomical Observatory in Helwan, Egypt. He was elected Fellow of the Society in 1908. In 1910 he became the first to photograph Halley's comet from this site. In 1913 he became superintendent of the Khedivial Observatory, and remained at that post until 1924. From 1918 until 1924 he also served as the Director of Meteorological Services in Egypt and Sudan. He performed welfare work for the British army during World War I, and was awarded the Order of the Nile, Class 4. (In 1926 he was awarded Order of the Nile, class 3.) He returned to England in 1924 to become Radcliffe Observer at the Radcliffe Observatory. Much of his labor during the following years was then spent in production of the Radcliffe Catalogue of Proper Motions, published in 1934. From 1926-30 he was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, then served as President 1931-32\\\\. His dissatisfaction with the observing conditions in England led him to lobby funds for a site in South Africa. This observatory would not be completed until 1939, however, when Knox-Shaw took up residence. The pouring of the blank for the main telescope was then held up until after World War II. From 1941-42 he was president of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa (ASSA). The mirror finally arrived in 1948, followed by a Cassegrain spectrograph in 1951. Two years later Knox-Shaw retired. He married Maisie (n√©e Weir of Pretoria) and the couple had one son, Peter, who was born in 1944. His twenty-year retirement was spent at Elgin, Western Cape. He died from a stroke, and his ashes were scattered on Radcliffe Observatory grounds.

Bioavailability  When taken orally, EGCG has poor absorption even at daily intake equivalent to 8‚Äì16 cups of green tea, an amount causing adverse effects such as nausea or heartburn. After consumption, EGCG blood levels peak within 1.7 hours. The absorbed plasma half-life is ~5 hours, but with majority of unchanged EGCG excreted into urine over 0 to 8 hours. Methylated metabolites appear to have longer half-lives and occur at 8-25 times the plasma levels of unmetabolized EGCG. Research Well-studied in basic research, EGCG has various biological effects in laboratory studies. EGCG is a modulator of the GABAA receptor. A 2011 analysis by the European Food Safety Authority found that a cause and effect relationship could not be shown for a link between tea catechins and the maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol concentration. A 2016 review found that high daily doses (107 to 856 mg/day) taken by human subjects over four to 14 weeks produced a small reduction of LDL cholesterol. Potential toxicity A 2018 review showed that excessive intake of EGCG may cause liver toxicity. In 2018, the European Food Safety Authority stated that daily intake of 800 mg or more could increase risk of liver damage. The degree of toxicity varies by person, suggesting that it is potentiated by genetic predisposition and the diet eaten during the period of ingestion, or other factors. Regulation Over 2008 to 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration issued several warning letters to manufacturers of dietary supplements containing EGCG for violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Most of these letters informed the companies that their promotional materials promoted EGCG-based dietary supplements the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions that cause them to be classified as drugs under the United States code, while another focused on inadequate quality assurance procedures and labeling violations. The warnings were issued because the products had not been established as safe and effective for their marketed uses and were promoted as \\"new drugs\\", without approval as required under the Act.

McQueen's character was named Josh Randall, and the gun has also been referred to as a Winchester Randall, or a Randall Special. Mare's Leg is now a generic term for a Winchester Model 1892 (or modern derivative) with a shortened barrel and stock. Prop gun The term \\"mare's leg\\" was introduced in 1957 in the TV series Trackdown, where Steve McQueen first appeared as a bounty hunter. Steve McQueen and his Mare's Leg went on to star in the CBS TV series Wanted Dead or Alive. Designed by Kenny \\"Von Dutch\\" Howard, an experienced artist and gunsmith, the original Mare's Leg was made by cutting down a .44-40 caliber Winchester Model 1892 rifle to a size that could be worn in a large leg holster and used with one hand. The barrel was cut to a length of nine inches, and much of the butt-stock was removed. The original Mare's Leg did not have sights. McQueen was involved in the final design, suggesting the duck-bill hammer and enlarged lever loop, and initiating a redesign of the custom holster. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was not consulted before the program aired and producers had to pay taxes totaling $1,100 in connection with the National Firearms Act of 1934. During filming three guns were made, each with an enlarged loop on the cocking lever. After filming started, the size of the levers was made smaller on all 3 guns. The second and third guns bore octagonal barrels instead of a round one. In a continuity oversight, a gun sometimes changed partway through a given scene. While the guns were chambered for the .44-40 round, McQueen wore more impressive looking .45-70 rounds in the loops of his gun belt. In season one a doctor, after removing a bullet fired from the Mare's Leg from the back of a criminal, identified the removed bullet as a 30-30 round. As of the 1980s, one of the original guns was on display at the now closed Spaghetti Station Restaurant and Museum (999 Ball Road, Anaheim, California). Another is in the Autry National Center of the American West.Steve McQueen's Carbine Autry National Center In 1964, french singer Gilbert B√©caud auctioned off one of the Winchester Mare's Leg used by Josh Randall. This auction took place in Paris in the presence of actor Steve McQueen, and the money raised was donated to the French Movement for Children's Villages (a association renamed in 2013 \\"Action Enfance\\").¬´ Gilbert B√©caud a achet√© le fusil de Josh Randall ¬ª, L‚Äô√âcho r√©publicain de la Beauce et du Perche, 17 September 1964. There have been a number of toys based on the Mare's Leg, from small cap guns to larger detailed toys complete with a holster. =Other appearances= In the 1987 film Wanted: Dead or Alive, a sequel to the series starring Rutger Hauer as Nick Randall, the grandson of Josh Randall, Nick keeps his grandfather's Mare's Leg in a display case in his office. Similar shortened rifles have appeared in: * Once Upon a Time in the West (1968 film) used by Woody Strode in a cameo, when sent to kill Charles Bronson's character \\"Harmonica\\". * My Name Is Nobody (1973) Used by a rustler 18 minutes into the film. * Boss Nigger (1975 blaxploitation western) used by the main character. * The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. (1993‚Äì1994 television series) featured Crystal Hawks, a bounty hunter played by Sheena Easton, who used a Mare's Leg. * Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999 survival horror video game) had main character Jill Valentine use this weapon as an unlockable item after defeating the Nemesis a certain number of times. Here, it is treated as a shotgun, and is given the designation M-37. * The Magnificent Seven (1998‚Äì2000 television series) featured Eric Close as Mare's Leg wielding Vin Tanner, reminiscent of McQueen's character Vin in the original film. * Firefly (2002 television series) and Serenity (2005 film) starred Gina Torres as Zoe Alleyne Washburne, who used the same Mare's Leg prop created for Brisco County, Jr. * Fistful of Frags (2007 first person shooter video game) as a low-tier starter weapon with high damage and low rate of fire. * Zombieland (2009 film) used by Woody Harrelson throughout the film. * Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) as the Model 1887, a shotgun unlocked in multiplayer when the player reaches Level 67. * Archer (Season 5, Episode 3) Archer uses this gun in this episode. * Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (2015) Antagonist Skull Face uses this weapon. * Battlefield 4 (2013) A modernised .44 Magnum Winchester Model 1892, available via an expansion pack, is referred to by this name. * State of Decay (video game) (2013 survival horror game) The rifle is one of several accessible weapons used by the survivors. * Warframe has the Grinlok rifle and the cut down version, known as the Marelok. * In 2016 Pawan Kalyan, a popular Indian film actor, used a mare's leg rifle as a stylish weapon in his film Sardaar Gabbar Singh * In Westworld (2016) Hector uses this weapon in season 1 and 2. Manufactured replicas A number of companies have marketed functional reproductions of the Mare's Leg, making them the same way as the original, by cutting down Winchester rifles. These reproductions also have the same legal restrictions as the original: a rifle may not have a barrel length less than 16 inches (41 cm) without obtaining a tax stamp from the ATF, in accordance with the National Firearms Act.Bounty Hunter Special (A Class 3, Mare's Leg reproduction) Other companies have marketed reproductions originally made and sold as handguns. Because of the legal restrictions, non-functional prop- quality replicas have been produced by some of the same companies that make functional copies. =Carbine= Since before 2000, Eagle Squadron Productions has produced and sold an authentic 1892 Winchester Mare's Leg carbine. It uses a Winchester 1892 carbine in the correct caliber of .44-40, and is based on one of the original prop guns. They also produce replica gun belt and a non- firing replica carbine.Bounty Hunter Special 2006 Eagle Squadron Productions =Handgun= In 2005, J.B. Custom began marketing a \\"1892 Mares Leg Lever Action Pistol\\". This pistol is a fully functional copy of Randall's weapon, available in a number of calibers. Since they are newly manufactured as pistols and sold subject to handgun regulations, rather than cut down rifles, they avoid legal difficulties. Like the original weapon, the J.B. Custom version has a 12-inch (30 cm) barrel, and an overall length of 24 inches (61 cm). The pistol was available in .45 Colt, .44-40 Winchester, and .38-40 Winchester. Early promotional material specified a limited production run of 50 units based on the number of available 1892 actions that could be used legally. Later versions of the weapons use a slightly different action that while not exactly like the 1892 model, cycles more reliably, and is commercially available. This version is available in .44 Magnum, and .357 Magnum. In 2008, Legacy Sports International introduced their version of the Mare's Leg, made by Chiappa Firearms, in Italy, imported for Legacy, and sold under the brand name \\"Puma\\". This Puma 92 pistol is named the Bounty Hunter. It is available in several calibers including; .44 Magnum, .45 Colt, and .44-40. With a 12-inch (30 cm) barrel, no shoulder stock, and a receiver that has never been built into a rifle, it is considered a pistol by the ATF. In 2010 Rossi Firearms began offering a Mare's Leg under the name \\"Ranch Hand\\". The Rossi version is chambered in .45 Colt, .44 Magnum/.44 Special, and .357 Magnum/.38 Special.Ranch Hand product page at Rossi USA The Rossi Ranch Hand is manufactured by Taurus in Brazil.Mike Searson (5 Sept 2018), Breach Bang Clear, https://www.breachbangclear.com/revisiting-the-mares-leg-rossi-ranch- hand/ Henry Repeating Arms manufactures two versions of the Mare's Leg. The rimfire model has a blued receiver and barrel and chambers .22 Long Rifle, .22 Long, and .22 Short. The centerfire model has a brass receiver and blued barrel and is available in .357 Mag, .44 Mag, and .45 Colt. Recently Henry Repeating Arms has added another rimfire version chambered in 22 WMR aka 22 Magnum. =Shotgun= A full-length 30 in. barrel Winchester M1887 lever action shotgun (top) in comparison to its shortened 18 in. barrel \\"Mare's Leg\\" variant (bottom). Italian firms, such as Chiappa Firearms, manufacture modern reproductions of the Winchester Model 1887 series shotguns. The shotguns appeared on the Australian and the European firearms markets in late 2008. Chiappa's replicas are offered with barrels ranging from 28 to 18.5 inches. They also offer a model with a rifled barrel and two models with pistol grips. The Model 1887 Mare's Leg was prominently used by the title character in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. One of the guns used in the film was modified with a pistol grip and an oversized loop on the trigger guard, allowing the character to fire and cycle the action with a one hand reverse spin. This in turn has popularised the gun's portrayal in various pop culture, mostly in shooter video games, where they mimic the cycling and reloading actions from the movie. Legal status In the United States under the National Firearms Act, to make a short barreled rifle from a firearm originally made and sold as a rifle requires payment of $200 for a tax stamp, approval from the BATFE and federal registration.\\"NFA Handbook, Chapter 4: Taxes Imposed by the NFA\\". Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (June 21, 2007). However, a \\"lever action pistol\\" made and sold subject to BATFE regulations is treated as a pistol by federal law. While most states allow the purchase of Mare's Leg lever action pistols, New York State has banned this gun from being sold there. They are also not approved for sale in Massachusetts. It is hard to get in California since it is not on the CA Roster of Approved Handguns (California Penal Code ¬ß 32015) and therefore cannot be sold or transferred to a civilian unless the gun is already privately owned within the state, having been previously imported under one of the narrow exemptions to the handgun roster.https://www.oag.ca.gov/firearms/certguns References  External links  * Category:Chiappa Firearms Category:Rossi Firearms Category:Lever- action rifles Category:Pistols ","title":"Mare's Leg"},{"id":"11179820","text":"James R.

Brazil In Brazil, pastel (plural: past√©is) is a typical fast- food Brazilian dish, consisting of half-circle or rectangle-shaped thin crust pies with assorted fillings, fried in vegetable oil. The result is a crispy, brownish fried pie. The most common fillings are ground meat, mozzarella, catupiry, heart of palm, codfish, cream cheese, chicken and small shrimp. Past√©is with sweet fillings such as guava paste with Minas cheese, banana and chocolate also exist. The pastel is classified in Brazilian cuisine as a salgado (savoury snack). It is traditionally sold on the streets, in open-air marketplaces, or in fast-food shops known as pastelarias. It is popularly said to have originated when Japanese immigrants adapted Chinese fried wontons to sell as snacks at weekly street markets. A common beverage to drink with past√©is is caldo de cana, a sugarcane juice. Portugal A pastel in Portugal may refer to several types of desserts or hors d'≈ìuvres. These include the pastel de bacalhau and the pastel de nata. Spain Pastel is typically a Spanish word that means cake, but can refer to very different dishes, popular in other Hispanic countries. Puerto Rico In Puerto Rico, pastel is a dish which includes diced pork with olives, capers, raisins, chickpeas, and sweet peppers. This mixture is centered in dough made mainly of green bananas with a small portion of plantain, yaut√≠a, and potato. The dough is tinted with annatto oil. It is wrapped in plantain leaf, tied with string, boiled and later served with arroz con gandules (yellow-rice with pigeon peas). The overall effect is very similar to Mexican and Peruvian tamales. The Philippines In the Philippines, pastel may refer to any (usually chicken or meat) casserole dish baked in a pie crust. Among Muslim Filipinos, pastel is an alternative spelling of pastil, which refer to two different dishes. Pastil (also spelled patil, patel, or patir) among the Danao-speaking peoples refers to white rice and meat wrapped in a banana leaf; while pastil among the Tausug people refers to a nativized version of the empanada. In the province of Camiguin, however, it refers specifically to pastel de Camigu√≠n, a soft, sweet filled bun. Indonesia In Indonesia pastel refer to pie of crust made of thin pastry filled with meat (usually chicken) mixed with vegetables (chopped carrot and beans), rice vermicelli and sometimes egg, then deep fried in vegetable oil. It is consumed as snack and commonly sold in Indonesian traditional markets. The similar Manadonese version replace thin flour pie crust with bread and filled with spicy cakalang (skipjack tuna) is called panada.

Hyde Park Boulevard in the historic Kenwood neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois. It is the oldest Jewish congregation in Chicago, with its oldest core founded in 1847 as Kehilath Anshe Ma'arav (\\"Congregation of the Men of the West\\"; Hebrew: ◊ß◊î◊ú◊™ ◊ê◊†◊©◊ô ◊û◊¢◊®◊ë). History The congregation Kehilath Anshe Ma'arav (\\"Congregation of the Men of the West\\") was founded on November 3, 1847, at the wholesale dry-goods store of Levi Rosenfeld and Jacob Rosenberg located at 155 East Lake Street by twenty men, many of whom hailed from Bavaria. At the time, this section of the Chicago Loop was the center of the small Chicago Jewish community. The newly founded congregation was first housed above Rosenfeld and Rosenberg's store at Lake and Wells street. After increasing membership and lack of space, the congregation was soon forced to find a more suitable space to accommodate their growing community. A lot was leased at Clark and Quincy streets (now the site of the Kluczynski Federal Building), and construction of a small frame synagogue began. After an investment of $12,000, the one and a half story building, with a capacity of 450 people, was dedicated on June 13, 1851. After only two years, their land lease had expired, forcing the congregation to move the new building to Adams and Wells in 1853. Unscathed by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, KAM's synagogue building was burned down in the Chicago Fire of 1874. In 1890, KAM moved into its Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler designed temple in Bronzeville, and in 1924 moved again to a private residence in Hyde Park. The former synagogue became the Pilgrim Baptist Church, the birthplace of Gospel music. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, designated a Chicago Landmark in 1981, and partially destroyed by fire in 2006. In 1971, KAM merged with another Reform congregation, Isaiah Israel (builders of the present synagogue), to become KAM Isaiah Israel. The synagogue is situated in the Kenwood neighborhood of Chicago, an area known for its large homes and well-to-do residents, such as Barack Obama (who lives across from the synagogue on Greenwood Avenue) and Muhammad Ali. The temple's architecture was inspired by those constructed during the Byzantine Period of Judaism. The minaret is not on top of the dome as it appears in this photo, but rather it is atop a tower that functions as a chimney, behind the building. Built for the Isaiah Israel congregation in 1924, the structure was designed by Alfred S. Alschuler, who drew his influence from photographs of the second-century Severus synagogue unearthed at Tiberias, in Galilee. The extensions were designed by architects John Alschuler (the son of Alfred) and Ron Dirsmith. The building was designated an official Chicago Landmark on June 9, 1977.

As the first to mention this tradition was Marinus Sanutus, it was most likely a Crusader-era invention.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, pp. 183, 200 =Bronze Age= It was a vassal of Megiddo in the fourteenth century BCE, according to the Amarna letters.Alexandre, 2012, Yafi‚Äòa Final report =Roman period= Josephus mentions the city Japha (Yafa) in his Life of Flavius Josephus (¬ß 37 and 45) and The Jewish War (Book 3, chapter 7, verse 31) as being the largest village in Galilee,Whiston, William (1737): Josephus' The Jewish War, translated by William Whiston and where at one time he took-up residence, providing for the village's defence and describing its capture by the Imperial Roman army in circa 63 CE.Josephus, The Jewish War 3.289 Chambers, cut in stone, three storeys high, have been found in the village. This was probably an old granary.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 353-354 Victor Gu√©rin noted that when one of the chambers was cleared out in 1869, a vase was found containing about two hundred coins of Roman emperors. According to his observations, there were two of the subterranean systems, one of which is described above, both of which have suffered considerable damage since they were first visited by him in 1870. He found nothing of the ancient town, except five or six fragments of columns, broken stones, and about thirty cisterns. The city formerly included three adjacent hills.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 103-105, as given by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 354 A stone quarry, also dating from the Roman period, has been excavated. It was in use from the late first century CE to the mid-fourth century CE.Shemer, 2016, Yafi‚Äòa, Final report =Mamluk period= Remains of a building from the Mamluk era has been excavated, with pottery sherds from that period.Zidan, 2015, Yafi‚ÄòaIsrael Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2013, Survey Permit # A-6789. =Ottoman period= In 1517, the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as being in the nahiya (\\"Subdistrict\\") of Tabariyya under the Liwa (\\"District\\") of Safad with a population of 14 Muslim households. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,200 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 190Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as Iaffa.Karmon, 1960, p. 167. In 1838 Edward Robinson described it as a small village, with 30 houses and the remains of a church. He further noted it as a Muslim and Greek Christian village in the Nazareth district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 132 When Gu√©rin visited in 1875, he found 400 inhabitants including Latins, Greek Orthodox, and Moslems. There were also Protestant schools in the village.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 103, as given by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 280 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as a \\"moderate-sized village in a strong position on the spur running from Nazareth down to Jebata. It has a well to the north side and a second in the valley to the north-east.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 280 A population list from about 1887 showed that Yafa had about 900 inhabitants; half Muslims, half Christians.Schumacher, 1888, p. 182 =British Mandate= Roman Catholic church in Kfar Yafia with a minaret visible behind it In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Yafa had a total population of 615; 215 Muslims and 400 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Nazareth, p. 38 Of the Christians, 168 were Orthodox, 112 Catholics, 108 Greek Catholic (Melchite) and 12 Anglicans.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 50 The population had increased at the 1931 census, when Yafa, (including Arab el Ghazzalin), had a population of 833; 456 Muslims and 377 Christians, in a total of 213 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 76 In the 1945 statistics the population size of Yafa was 1,070; 580 Muslims and 490 Christians,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 8 with a total of 17,809 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 63 Of this, 710 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 12,701 used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 110 while 149 dunams were built-up (urban) land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 160 In 1921, a synagogue lintel was found there, and in 1950 part of a synagogue paved with mosaics was excavated near the Greek Orthodox church. =State of Israel= In 1948 Yafa was captured by the Israeli army during Operation Dekel which was launched in July.Morris, 1987, p. 200 The remaining population were put under martial law which remained in force until 1966. A substantial portion of Yafa's population today are the descendants of internally displaced Palestinian Arabs from the neighbouring village of Ma'alul which was depopulated during the 1948 Arab- Israeli war. People from Ma'alul participated in the local elections in Yafa under the banner of the \\"Ma'alul refugees' party\\", with a platform also focused on issues of interest or concern to the wider population, as a way of attracting political support from local parties.

Hr√≥lfsd√≥ttir (Hild Rolvsdatter) was a 9th-century woman who is referenced in various Old Norse sources including √ìl√°fs saga, Orkneyinga saga and Landn√°mab√≥k. According to the sagas, Hild was the daughter of Rolv Nefia (Hr√≥lfr nefja) jarl at Trondhjem (modern day Trondheim). In the Orkneyinga saga, the daughter of Rolv Nefia was called Ragnhild, although in the Heimskringla she was called Hild. Her father used to go on Viking expeditions. One summer he plundered in V√≠k. This aroused king Harald Fairhair's anger and he was banished. Hild appealed unsuccessfully for clemency for her father. On this occasion she composed a scaldic stanza (lausav√≠sa), which is one of the few testimonies of scaldic poetry composed by a woman that has come down to us. She was married to Rognvald Eysteinsson (Ragnvald √òysteinsson M√∏rejarl) who was the jarl of M√∏re. They had three sons: √çvarr, √û√≥rir and Hr√≥lfr. Thorir (√û√≥rir) succeeded his father as jarl of More. Rolv (Hr√≥lfr), nicknamed Gange- Rolv, became known as Rollo of Normandy. The death of Ivar (√çvarr) during an earlier campaign in support of King Harald Finehair resulted in the Northern Isles (Nor√∞reyar) being gifted to his family as compensation. According to the Historia Norvegiae, Rognvald's family conquered Orkney and Shetland Islands in the late ninth century.

It is located in Glenwood Canyon, about east of Glenwood Springs, Colorado and is a popular tourist destination. When open, the lake is reached via a trailhead located along the Glenwood Canyon Bike and Pedestrian Path that runs along the north side of I-70 in the bottom of the canyon. The trail follows Dead Horse Creek, a tributary of the Colorado River and ascends some in elevation for from the trailhead to the lake. Hanging Lake View of the Glenwood Canyon from the Hanging Lake trail Hanging Lake Winter 2019  History  Early tales of the discovery of the lake tell of a man searching for gold in the canyon. The man found a dead horse at the opening of a gulch (the possible origin of the name of Dead Horse Gulch). When he followed the gulch up through the steep hillside through the canyon he came around the back side of the lake. This is how he first saw the small bowl-like basin hanging onto the cliffs below. In the years following, the area served as a homestead and a private family retreat until it was purchased by Glenwood Springs after the Taylor Bill was passed by Congress in 1910. Following the purchase it began its long history as a public tourist stop, and later during the 1940s hosted a resort and cafe until the construction of Interstate-70 began in 1968. In 1972, the trail and the lake were returned to the protection of the Forest Service as part of the White River National Forest, and has been an increasingly popular tourist destination since. In 2011, the lake was named a National Natural Landmark by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.  Geology and travertine  The fragile shoreline of Hanging Lake is composed of travertine, created when dissolved limestone from the Mississippian Period Leadville Formation (through which Dead Horse Creek flows) is deposited on rocks and logs, creating travertine layers. Hanging Lake is located on a fault line and was formed when roughly an acre and a half of the valley floor sheared off from the fault and dropped to what is now the shallow bed of the lake. The turquoise colors of the lake are produced by carbonate minerals that have dissolved in the water.  Recreation  Hanging Lake is one of the most popular hiking destinations in Colorado. Beginning May 1, 2019, a paid permit is required to access the trailhead to Hanging Lake. Access fees vary by season. On February 22, 2019, The Forest Service and the City of Glenwood Springs announced that H2O Ventures (Glenwood Springs, Colorado) was awarded the contract for the Hanging Lake Shuttle service, set to launch on May 1, 2019. The Hanging Lake parking area in Glenwood Canyon will be closed to personal vehicles during the peak season, May 1 to October 31, when the shuttle service is in operation. Those wishing to bike to the trailhead and hike to Hanging Lake still need to secure a reservation in advance. The entire hike is approximately 3.2 miles round trip, and 2 hours of hiking time. Behind the lake, hikers will discover Spouting Rock, a much larger waterfall that flows from a set of holes in the limestone cliffs of Dead Horse Canyon. Hanging Lake receives over 131,000 visitors per year. =Winter Access= During the winter, the Hanging Lake Trail is icy, snow-packed, and slippery. The use of winter traction devices is required (e.g. ice cleats, micro-spikes, mini crampons) as well as hiking poles. Cold temperatures also necessitate appropriate clothing, food, water, equipment, and winter survival gear. Hiking the trail may take longer due to winter conditions. =Restricted Activities= The travertine lake is extremely sensitive, therefore dogs, drones, fishing, and swimming (or bodily contact with water at Hanging Lake) are strictly prohibited. Do not harass, feed, or disturb wild animals, particularly during winter when they are conserving energy to stay alive. During winter, visitors are strongly warned to stay off the frozen lake (whether partially or fully frozen) because it is extremely dangerous to walk on the ice. Even during winter, walking off-trail is not permitted. Parking at Hanging Lake parking area is only allowed Nov. 1 - April 30 with a reservation. Parking is not allowed along entrance or exit ramps of I-70 at any time. Fragile ecosystem Because of the high amount of traffic, Hanging Lake faces the threats of ecological disruption. Litter from visitors, and the effects of wading and swimming by humans and dogs (dogs and swimming are both prohibited), are having a significant impact on the peculiar ecosystem of the lake.

The goal of meta-ontology is to clarify what ontology is about and how to interpret the meaning of ontological claims. Different meta-ontological theories disagree on what the goal of ontology is and whether a given issue or theory lies within the scope of ontology. There is no universal agreement whether meta-ontology is a separate field of inquiry besides ontology or whether it is just one branch of ontology. The term \\"meta-ontology\\" is of recent origin. It was first used by Peter van Inwagen in analyzing Willard Van Orman Quine's critique of Rudolf Carnap's metaphysics, where Quine introduced a formal technique for determining the ontological commitments in a comparison of ontologies. Relation to ontology Thomas Hofweber, while acknowledging that the use of the term is controversial, suggests that, although strictly construed meta-ontology is a separate metatheory of ontology, the field of ontology can be more broadly construed as containing its metatheory. Advocates of the term seek to distinguish 'ontology', which investigates what there is, from 'meta'-ontology, which investigates what we are asking when we ask what there is. Realism The meta-ontological realist holds that there are objective answers to the basic questions of ontology. Recent work in meta- ontological realism can be roughly divided into 2 approaches: the neo- Aristotelian approach and the Quinean approach. =Quinean approach= According to the Quinean approach, the goal of ontology is to determine what exists and what doesn't exist. Quine himself developed a specific version of this approach relying on first-order logic and pre-existing scientific theories in order to answer existence-question. It involves translating these theories into first-order logic formulas. Their ontological commitments are then read off from the existential quantifiers used in the formulas. One idea behind this approach is that scientific theories are our best guess about what is true. But in order for them to be true there should be something there that makes them true: their truthmakers. The existential quantifiers act as a guide to truthmakers. Another approach to answering existence-question is proposed by Amie L. Thomasson. Her easy approach to ontology differs from Quine's approach in that it relies on common sense instead of science. The approach is easy because it usually starts off from very trivial common-sense premises. For example, an easy argument for the existence of numbers in the philosophy of mathematics can be made in the following way. There are five books on the table. So the number of books on the table is five. Therefore numbers exist. Thomasson's approach differs from Quine's not just concerning her commitment to common sense but also concerning her account of quantification. =Neo- Aristotelian approach= According to the neo-Aristotelian approach, the goal of ontology is to determine which entities are fundamental and how the non- fundamental entities depend on them. The concept of fundamentality is usually defined in terms of metaphysical grounding. Fundamental entities are different from non-fundamental entities because they are not grounded in other entities. For example, it is sometimes held that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects (like chairs and tables) they compose. This is a claim about the grounding-relation between microscopic and macroscopic objects. A neo-Aristotelian would categorize this claim as an ontological claim. Aristotle himself was also \\"neo-Aristotelian\\" in the sense that he held that entities from different ontological categories have different degrees of fundamentality. For example, substances have the highest degree of fundamentality because they exist in themselves. Properties, on the other hand, are less fundamental because they depend on substances for their existence. Jonathan Schaffer's priority monism is a more recent form of neo- Aristotelian ontology. He holds that on the most fundamental level there exists only one thing: the world as a whole. This thesis doesn't deny our common-sense intuition that the distinct objects we encounter in our everyday affairs like cars or other people exist. It only denies that these objects have the most fundamental form of existence. =Comparison= According to Schaffer, an important difference between the two approaches is that the Quinean approach leads to a flat ontology while the neo-Aristotelian approach leads to an ordered ontology. In a flat ontology, there is no difference in fundamentality between the different objects: they are all on the same level. In an ordered ontology, on the other hand, the entities are part of a complex hierarchical structure with different levels. The higher levels of this structure are grounded in the more basic levels. Schaffer also distinguishes a third type of ontology which he calls sorted. Sorted ontologies classify entities into different exclusive ontological categories. But this classification doesn't entail any hierarchical relations between the entities of the different categories. It has been argued that neo-Aristotelianism is not a genuine alternative to Quineanism. So theories in ontology may combine elements from both approaches without becoming inconsistent. Anti-realism The meta-ontological anti-realist holds that there are no objective answers to the basic questions of ontology. One example of such an approach is Rudolf Carnap's thesis that the truth of existence-claims depends on the framework in which these claims are formulated. The choice between frameworks is guided by pragmatic considerations but there is no definite fact about which framework is correct. Quine disagreed with his teacher Carnap on these points, which lead to the Carnap-Quine debate. Amie L. Thomasson says that the Carnap-Quine debate is misplaced when it focuses (as done by Van Inwagen) upon the analytic-synthetic distinction between entities: \\"The real distinction instead [that is, instead of the analytic-synthetic distinction] is between existence questions asked using a linguistic framework and existence questions that are supposed to be asked somehow without being subject to those rules‚Äîasked, as Quine puts it 'before the adoption of the given language'.\\" These questions are what Carnap referred to as internal-external distinctions.

Known as Aviation Boulevard, the highway runs from MD 176 near Ferndale north to MD 170 in Linthicum in northern Anne Arundel County. MD 162 forms the eastern portion of the Airport Loop that circumscribes Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport) and connects the airport with Interstate 97 (I-97). Most of what is now MD 162 was Maryland Route 167 in the late 1960s and early 1970s; MD 167 previously had been assigned to a different portion of Hammonds Ferry Road in Linthicum from the 1930s to the early 1960s. MD 162 was assigned along the length of MD 167's second route in the late 1980s and immediately relocated at its northern end. The remainder of the highway was expanded to a divided highway in the 1990s. Route description View south along MD 162 at MD 762 in Linthicum MD 162 begins at an intersection with MD 176 (Dorsey Road) and Stewart Avenue, which forms the southern leg of the intersection, at the southeastern corner of the BWI Airport property south of Ferndale. Eastbound MD 176 provides full access to I-97 and westbound MD 176 forms a continuation of Airport Loop. MD 162 heads north as a five-lane divided highway, with three lanes northbound and two lanes southbound, and follows the eastern boundary of the airport property. The highway's first intersection is with Cromwell Park Drive, which is unsigned MD 162A and has a right-in/right-out interchange with southbound I-97. North of the intersection, MD 162 temporarily expands to six lanes before reducing to four lanes. The highway passes to the west of an industrial park before forming the western edge of a residential subdivision. At the northern end of the subdivision, MD 162 makes a curve to the west, within which it intersects Andover Road, which heads north as MD 762 and south to the historic Benson-Hammond House. The highway passes between a pair of long-term parking lots and crosses Cabin Branch before reaching its northern terminus at MD 170, which heads north through Linthicum as Camp Meade Road toward I-695. Aviation Boulevard and Airport Loop continue west along the other direction of MD 170 toward MD 295 and the main airport entrance. MD 162 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector for its entire length. History MD 162 follows the path of what was once the southernmost portion of Hammonds Ferry Road. The portion of Hammonds Ferry Road through Linthicum from MD 170 to the bridge across the Patapsco River was built as a wide concrete road in 1929 and later marked as MD 167. The MD 167 portion of Hammonds Ferry Road was transferred back to county maintenance in 1961 or 1962. MD 167 was reassigned to Hammonds Ferry Road from MD 176 to MD 170 in 1969. The highway reverted to a county road again in 1973 or 1974. The highway was relocated to its present alignment south of what is now Cromwell Park Drive by 1978. MD 162 was assigned to Hammonds Ferry Road from MD 176 to MD 170 in 1987; the northernmost portion of this stretch included what is now MD 762. The east-west portion of the highway that now forms its northernmost portion was built as a county highway around 1970 and reconstructed as a four- lane divided highway in 1988. MD 162 and MD 170 on the perimeter of the airport had their names changed to Aviation Boulevard (from Hammonds Ferry Road and Camp Meade Road, respectively) by 1991. The highway was expanded to a multi-lane divided highway from MD 762 south to the southern edge of the residential subdivision in 1993 and to MD 176 by 1999. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 162A is the designation for the portion of Cromwell Park Drive from MD 162 east to a right-in/right-out interchange with southbound I-97. Cromwell Park Drive continues north as a county-maintained highway into an industrial park. MD 162A was assigned to the entirety of Cromwell Park Drive in 1999. The portion of the road north of the I-97 ramps was transferred to county maintenance in 2002.

Currently owned by Salem Media Group, WGKA serves as the Atlanta affiliate for the Salem Radio Network and the Clemson Tigers football radio network. The WGKA studios are located on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, while the station transmitter resides near the Morningside Nature Preserve. Besides a standard analog transmission, WGKA is available online. Historically, the station is perhaps better known as the original home of WGST, founded by the Georgia Institute of Technology; WGST's programming and call letters moved to 640 AM (now WBIN) via an intellectual property transaction in 1989. History =WBBF= The station was first licensed by the U.S. Department of Commerce on 1110 kilocycles, on January 7, 1924; owned by the Georgia Institute of Technology, then known as the \\"Georgia School of Technology\\", it got the sequentially issued call sign of WBBF.\\"New Stations: Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 1, 1924, page 3. Although much of the equipment used by WBBF had been previously used at WGM, the Department of Commerce considered WGM and WBBF to be separate stations, and current Federal Communications Commission records list January 7, 1924 as WGKA's \\"first license date\\". Much of the initial station equipment had been donated by the Atlanta Constitution newspaper, which had closed its station, WGM, the previous July. This donation to the electrical engineering students was made to help familiarize them with the new technology used for radio broadcasting.\\"Tech Sends First Message To Radio Fans of America\\" by Parks Rusk, Atlanta Constitution, January 15, 1924, page 1. WBBF's debut broadcast was made on the evening of January 14, 1924, beginning at 7:30 p.m. with a ten-minute address by President M. L. Brittain. He lauded \\"the generosity of Editor Clark Howell and The Constitution\\". The Atlanta Constitution reported that he also \\"expressed the gratitude of the institution to The Constitution for presenting without cost to Tech the powerful broadcasting equipment.\\" The program finished at 8:30 with fifty band students playing the college's fight song, \\"Ramblin' Wreck.\\" The station's initial schedule was limited to a single one-hour program on Monday evenings; WBBF suspended operations in early June for summer vacation, before resuming in September.\\"Last Tech Radio Concert Until September\\", Atlanta Constitution, Juie 2, 1924, page 12. =WGST (920 AM)= On January 12, 1925, WBBF's call letters were changed to WGST (Georgia School of Technology).\\"Georgia School of Technology\\", Education's Own Stations by S. E. Frost, Jr., 1937, pages 105-106. In 1928, as part of the implementation of the Federal Radio Commission's General Order 40, the station moved to 890 kHz. In April 1930, the school made an agreement with the Southern Broadcasting Stations, Inc. to operate WGST as a commercial station, while still under the oversight of Georgia Tech. WGST was a CBS Radio Network affiliate, carrying its dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In March 1941, under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), stations transmitting on 890 kHz were moved to 920 kHz, where WGST and its successors have been ever since.\\"United States Assignments\\", March 29, 1941, North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. During the 1940s, the studios and offices were located in the Forsyth Building in Downtown Atlanta. For many years the antenna was old-fashioned design using multi-strand horizontal wires, strung between two supporting towers on the Forsyth Building, across from Georgia Tech's campus. In the late 1940s, WGST lost its CBS affiliation to WAGA (590 AM); WGST joined the Mutual Broadcasting System and later became an ABC Radio affiliate in the 1950s.Broadcasting Yearbook (1949 edition) page 104. WGST was the first station to play rock 'n roll in Atlanta in the 1950s.\\"Atlanta Area AM Radio Stations\\" by Jeffrey Leachman (leachlegacy.ece.gatech.edu) Radio personality Paul Drew made his debut on WGST with a weekend show \\"The Big Record.\\" Ray Charles' song \\"I Got a Woman\\" was recorded at WGST in the early 1950s.[ I Got a Woman by Ray Charles (allmusic.com)] In 1956, WGST moved next to the Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the Georgia Tech campus. The station's facilities were built on top of the Coliseum's locker rooms, featuring two large studios for live performances, complete with grand pianos. They remained in use by WGST into the 1970s; starting in 1977, Georgia Tech's FM radio station, WREK, occupied most of the original studios, including one of the two big rooms, until 2004 when WREK moved to the current studios in the Georgia Tech Student Center. Through most of the 1960s, WGST ran a Top 40 radio format, but by the late 1960s it changed to middle of the road music, in an attempt to cut into WSB's audience. In 1971, WGST switched back to Top 40, and was billed simply as \\"92\\". By 1972, the station had changed to a Solid Gold Oldies format. In 1973, it adopted a mix of oldies and adult contemporary music. The station did fairly well in the Arbitron ratings (now Nielsen Audio), but it was stronger at night, particularly in the male 25-49 demographic, boosted in part when WGST became the flagship station for the Atlanta Flames hockey broadcasts. The station continued with its long-running Georgia Tech Football Network and Georgia Tech Basketball broadcasts. As the city kept growing, it was difficult to hear the station in some of Atlanta's suburbs. That made it hard to achieve numbers comparable to ratings king WSB, which is powered at 50,000 watts around the clock. WGST ran at 5,000 watts by day, but dropped to 1,000 watts at night, to protect other stations on the frequency. In 1968, Georgia Tech put an FM station, WREK, on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook (1970 edition) page B-49. In 1973, the Georgia Board of Regents decided WGST was \\"surplus property.\\" In 1974, it was sold for five million dollars to the Meredith Corporation, despite opposition from alumni groups, members of the Georgia General Assembly and even the Governor of Georgia. However, profits from the sale were used to upgrade Georgia Tech's student-run WREK, which in 1978 moved to the Coliseum studios vacated by WGST in 1975. Under the Meredith Corporation, WGST tried to compete with WSB by becoming a full service Top 40 station and hiring big name DJs such as Chuck Daugherty, Sam Holman from WABC in New York City, Tony Taylor from WNBC, also in New York, and Skinny Bobby Harper, who came from Kansas City. But WGST's ratings languished, despite the high-priced talent Meredith had assembled. By October 1977, WGST switched to an all-news format.Broadcasting Yearbook (1978 edition) page C-50. But it began adding some talk shows by 1980 and in 1983, hired Neal Boortz who already had experience hosting on Atlanta talk station WRNG (now WCNN). Boortz became the cornerstone for the WGST talk line-up. In 1985, WGST was bought by Jacor Communications, which already owned easy listening FM station WPCH (94.9 FM).Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook (1987 edition) page B-70. =WAFS (920 AM)= In 1988, WPBD (640 AM) began operations, although the owners soon announced that the station was for sale. Jacor made arrangements to purchase WPBD and transfer WGST's call letters and format onto the new station. As part of these moves, Jacor divested WGST to the Moody Bible Institute, a Christian radio organization in Chicago, for $2.3 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2003-2004 page D-113 On June 30, 1989, Moody changed WGST's callsign to WAFS and changed format from news/talk to Christian talk and teaching; Jacor concurrently changed WPBD's call letters to WGST. WAFS became the Atlanta affiliate of Moody Radio, which lasted until 2004. =WGKA (2004-present)= Previous logo The Moody Bible Institute sold WAFS on March 24, 2004 to Salem Communications.\\"Scooping up stations\\" by Lisa R.

This region is characterized by stressful conditions as a result of extreme cold, low precipitation, a limited growing season (50‚Äì90 days) and virtually no sunlight throughout the winter. The Arctic consists of taiga (or boreal forest) and tundra biomes, which also dominate very high elevations, even in the tropics. Sensitive ecosystems exist throughout the Arctic region, which are being impacted dramatically by global warming. The earliest inhabitants of the Arctic were the Neanderthal sub-species. Since then, many indigenous populations have inhabited the region, which continues to this day. Since the early 1900s, when Vilhjalmur Stefansson led the first major Canadian Arctic Expedition, the Arctic has been a valued area for ecological research. In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established in Point Barrow, Alaska under the contract of the Office of Naval Research. This launched an interest in exploring the Arctic examining animal cycles, permafrost and the interactions between indigenous peoples and the Arctic ecology. During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.Berkes, Fikret and Dyanna Jolly. ‚ÄúAdapting to Climate Change: Social- Ecological Resilience in a Canadian Western Arctic Community.‚Äù Conservation Ecology 5 (2001).

A sunset in the arctic region. Arctic environment To understand Arctic ecology, it is important to consider both the terrestrial and oceanic aspects of the region. A few important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost. Sea ice is frozen seawater that moves with oceanic currents. It provides important habitat and a resting place for animals, particularly during the winter months. Over time, small pockets of seawater get trapped in the ice, and the salt is squeezed out. This causes the ice to become progressively less salty. Sea ice persists throughout the year, but there is less ice available during summer months. Large portions of the land are also frozen during the year. Permafrost is substrate that has been frozen for a minimum of 2 years. There are two types of permafrost: discontinuous and continuous. Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas where the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below freezing (); this forms in sheltered locations. In areas where the mean annual soil surface temperature is below , continuous permafrost forms. This is not limited to sheltered areas and ranges from a few inches below the surface to over deep. The top layer is called the active layer. It thaws in the summer and is critical to plant life. Biomes Moisture and temperature are major physical drivers of natural ecosystems. The more arid and colder conditions found at higher northern latitudes (and high elevations elsewhere) support tundra and boreal forests. The water in this region is generally frozen and evaporation rates are very low. Species diversity, nutrient availability, precipitation, and average temperatures increase as you move from the tundra to boreal forests and then to deciduous temperate ecosystems, which are found south of these Arctic biomes. =Tundra= Tundra is found from 55 ¬∞ to 80¬∞ N latitude in North America, Eurasia and Greenland. It can be found at lower latitudes at high elevations as well. The average temperature is ; during the summer it is less than . Average precipitation ranges from , and the permafrost is thick. Plant species supported by tundra have small leaves, are short (74 mm to <5 m), tend to be deciduous, and have a high ratio of roots to shoots. They are composed mainly of perennial forbs, dwarf shrubs, grasses, lichens, and mosses. =Boreal= In comparison to tundra, boreal forest has a longer and warmer growing season and supports larger species diversity, an increase in canopy height, vegetation density, and biomass. Boreal conditions can be found across northern North America and Eurasia. The boreal forests in the interior of the continents grow on top of permafrost due to very cold winters (see drunken trees), while much of the boreal forest has patchy permafrost or lack permafrost completely. The short (3‚Äì4 month) growing season in boreal forests is sustained by greater levels of rainfall (between per year) than the tundra receives; This biome is dominated by closed canopy forests of evergreen conifers, especially spruces, fir, pine and tamarack with some diffuse-porous hardwoods. Shrubs, herbs, ferns, mosses, and lichens are also important species. Stand-replacing crown fires are very important to this biome, occurring as frequently as every 50‚Äì100 years in some parts. Adaptations to conditions =Humans= Humans living in the Arctic region generally rely on warm clothing and buildings to protect them from the elements. Acclimatization, or the adjustment to new conditions, appears to be the most common form of adaptation to cold environments. No genetic advantage has been found when different people groups or races are compared. There is no evidence that fat is grown in response to cold, although its presence is advantageous. Amazingly, most people living in the Arctic region live a lifestyle very connected to the environment, spending significant time outside and depending heavily on hunting and fishing. =Other animals= Animals that are active in the winter have adaptations for surviving the intense cold. A common example is the presence of strikingly large feet in proportion to body weight. These act like snowshoes, and can be found on animals like the snowshoe hare and caribou. Many of the animals in the Arctic are larger than their temperate counterparts (Bergmann‚Äôs rule), taking advantage of the smaller ratio of surface area to volume that comes with increasing size. This increases the ability to conserve heat. Layers of fat, plumage, and fur are also very effective insulators to help retain warmth and are common in Arctic animals including polar bears and marine mammals. Some animals also have digestive adaptations to improve their ability to digest woody plants either with or without the aid of microbial organisms. This is highly advantageous during the winter months when most soft vegetation is beneath the snow pack. Not all Arctic animals directly face the rigors of winter. Many migrate to warmer climates at lower latitudes, while others avoid the difficulties of winter by hibernating until spring. Although these options might seem to be easy solutions to the difficulties of surviving an extreme environment, both are very expensive in terms of energy and risk of predation. =Plants= One of the most serious problems that plants face is ice crystal formation in the cells, which results in tissue death. Plants have two ways to resist freezing: avoid it or tolerate it. Plants have several avoidance mechanisms to prevent freezing. It can build up insulation, have its stem close to the ground, use the insulation from snow cover, and supercool. When supercooling, water is able to remain in its liquid state down to (compared to its usual freezing point). After water reaches , it spontaneously freezes and plant tissue is destroyed. This is called the nucleation point. The nucleation point can be lowered if dissolved solutes are present. Alternatively, plants have several different ways to tolerate freezing. Some plants allow freezing by allowing extracellular, but not intracellular freezing. Plants let water freeze in extracellular spaces, which creates a high vapor deficit that pulls water vapor out of the cell. This process dehydrates the cell and allows it to survive temperatures well below . Another problem associated with extreme cold is cavitation. Ring-porous wood is susceptible to cavitation because the large pores that are used for water transport easily freeze. Cavitation is much less of problem in trees with ring-diffuse wood. In ring-diffuse wood, there is a reduced risk of cavitation, as transport pores are smaller. The trade-off is that these species are not able to transport water as efficiently. History of Arctic ecology =Early history= Many different peoples had inhabited present-day Canada and Alaska by AD 1000. Most of these people lived by hunting, gathering and fishing; agriculture was not done often in the region. Most of these peoples were nomadic and their activity was largely seasonal. Early Archaic Culture influenced the Plano Culture by about 8000 BC. The Plano peoples and other cultural groups stemming from the Archaic Culture were notable for their use of spear-throwing technology, which likely made them able to maintain larger populations and expand their access to different foods. By AD 1000, the indigenous Arctic inhabitants have also developed other tools that improved their standard of living, such as fire which was set to the woodlands to be used to drive deer to be hunted.Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC- CLIO, 2007. pgs. 25-32. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English scientist William Scoresby explored the Arctic and wrote reports on its meteorology, zoology and geophysics. Around this time, the Arctic region was becoming a major subject of imperial science. Though permanent observatories were not yet established, traveling scientists began to gather magnetic data in the Arctic in the early nineteenth century. In June 1831, Sir James Ross and a group of Eskimos explored the Booth Peninsula in order to determine the exact location of the Magnetic North Pole. In the European Arctic, however, Scandinavian powers collected most of the scientific data as a result of early colonies established by Norsemen in Iceland and Greenland. Scientific expeditions to the Arctic started to happen more frequently by the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1338‚Äì1840, French La Recherche went on an expedition to the North Atlantic with a team of French, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Between 1856 and 1914, the Swedes made about twenty- five expeditions to the Arctic island of Spitsbergen in Norway. As the Swedes expanded their influence in Spitsbergen, they used the area for economic as well as scientific motives through mining and resource extraction. During this time, the United States, Russia, Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany also started to become more active in Spitsbergen.S√∂rlin, Sverker(2006)'Science, Empire, and Enlightenment: Geographies of Northern Field Science', European Review of History,13:3,455 ‚Äî 472 =Modern history= In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established under the contract of the Office of Naval Research in Point Barrow, Alaska for the purpose of investigating the physical and biological phenomena unique to the Arctic. In 1948, Dr. Laurence Irving was appointed as the Scientific Director of the Arctic Research Laboratory and put in charge of coordinating various projects. Scientists performed fieldwork to collect data that linked new observations to prior widely accepted knowledge. Through the processes of soil sampling, surveying and photographing landscapes and distributing salmon tags, scientists demonstrated the significance of historical case studies in the study of environmental science. The ability to compare past and present data allowed scientists to understand the causes and effects of ecological changes. Around this time, geographers from McGill University were developing new methods of studying geography in the North. As laboratory research was beginning to trump field research, McGill geographers implemented use of aviation in research, helping knowledge production to occur in the laboratory instead of in the field. Aviation allowed researchers to remould the way they studied the Northern landscape and indigenous people. Quick and easy travel using aircraft also promoted an integration of the Northern science with Southern community-based science, while changing the scale of ecology being studied. The ability to photograph, and observe the Arctic from an aircraft, provided researchers with a larger scope that allowed them to see a massive amount of space at one time, while also asserting objectivity. A photograph produces evidence, similar to laboratory data, yet it can be understood, circulated and accepted by the common people due to its aesthetic value.Bocking, Stephen. \\"A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960.\\" Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290. During the Cold War, the Canadian government began taking initiatives to secure the continent, and to assert territorial authority over northern Canada, including the Arctic, which at the time had a dominant American presence. The Canadian government demonstrated their desire for national dominance and security by requiring permission from other nations to utilize their land for military initiatives. They also supported and implemented civilian initiatives including resource development, wildlife conservation and the social and economic development of indigenous peoples.Bocking, Stephen. \\"A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960.\\" Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290. In 1950‚Äôs, ecologist Charles Elton was drawn to the Arctic to study the existence, causes and effects of cycles in animal populations, while ecologists Frank Banfield and John Kelsal studied the factors, especially human impacts, influencing hunting and game populations on animals such as caribou.Bocking, Stephen. ‚ÄúScience and Spaces in the Northern Environment.‚Äù Environmental History 12 (2007): 867-94. Accessed on February 23, 2014. The 1960s and 1970s brought a decrease in the desire to protect the Arctic as it was seen to lack a significant amount of biodiversity. This allowed for scientists to extend further research in the area. In June 1960, the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) was constructed, headed by General Duncan Hallock and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The two predecessor organizations that made up the CRREL were the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory (ACFEL), and the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE). The goal of the CREEL laboratory was to bring together the ACFEL and SIPRE to expand the size and scientific reputation of these organizations, solve problems in cold regions and explore the basic environmental characteristics of cold regions.Wright, Edmund. CRREL's First 25 Years 1961-1986. Arctic: Technical Publications Writer- Editor, 1986. As a result, study and management of the Arctic was taken over by consulting firms hired and controlled by the government. =Indigenous peoples and research= As research in the Arctic region of northern North America became more frequent, conflicts between researchers and the indigenous peoples started to occur. Recently, the indigenous communities of the North American Arctic have played a direct role in setting ethical standards for research in the region. Scientists have combined the use of laboratory research and field research in the Polar Regions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its characteristics. Because of scientific research in the north, living in and traveling to the Arctic has become much safer. However, the indigenous peoples viewed the effects of the research and development in the area differently than the scientists did. Since the 1960s, indigenous peoples have been more politically active and began pursuing the recognition of their rights regarding land-claims and self-government institutions. Indigenous communities voiced their concern that this research could lead to undesirable changes to the region‚Äôs landscape and economy. Canadian officials responded to their concerns by addressing the responsibility of scientists to consult with indigenous communities before conducting research. In 1977, the Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies (ACUNS) was founded at Churchill, Manitoba to improve scientific activity in the region. ACUNS published a document aimed at promoting cooperation between the northern indigenous people and researchers called Ethical Principles for the Conduct of Research in the North (1982). The document was published in English, French, and Inuktitut so it could be clearly understood among different groups. Relationships between science and society in the Arctic continue to change and adapt based on the politics of the region.Korsmo, Fae L. and Amanda Graham. \\"Research in the North American North: Action and Reaction.\\" Arctic 55.4 (2002): 319-328. Web. Human ecology in the Arctic Evidence has been found of early humans in the early W√ºrm-Weichsel period hunting large Arctic mammals in the Ice Age steppes of northern Europe. However, it is still unclear whether these humans were just temporary migrants or inhabitants of Arctic colonies at the time. Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic. The earliest inhabitants of the polar regions were the Neanderthals, or Homo neanderthalensis, who are considered to be an intermediate stage between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens sapiens. The Neanderthals made advances in the basic production of stone, bone antler and flint tools, which archaeologists call a Mousterian industry. About 40,000 years ago, the Neanderthals quickly disappeared and were replaced by modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens. Just a few thousand years after the sudden disappearance of the Neanderthals, modern humans occupied all the land that their predecessors had occupied. Some scientists believe that the Neanderthals were overcome by the incoming modern race, commonly called Cro-Magnon people, while others believe the race disappeared by integrating itself within the new population. The Rapid cooling the earliest inhabitants felt signaled an early onset of the Little Ice Age of the 1300s. This caused the sea ice to expand making traveling through Greenland and Iceland impossible to manage. This trapped the people in their homes and settlements which made trading come to a stop (National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2020). Because of this, the people have adapted very well to these conditions. It is seen through their use of animal hides in their clothing, tree branches used to make tepee shelters, and their use of ice blocks to make igloos to trap heat (Reference, 2020). in certain areas of the Arctic, many big-footed animals leave tracks and trails behind that lead to plants and trees filled with roots, berries, nuts and other foods needed to survive. Hunters are easily able to find their source of foods because of this (Scholastic, 1961). It is extremely important for a hunter to be smart and really take in their surroundings. They must watch the way animals move and where their prey may be located. They must also keep their eye open for the way the sea moves as well as the weather if they plan to fish or hunt near the water (Vitebsky 2000). Because the temperature can be very extreme, it is very important to become accustomed to the climate. Temperatures can drop to as cold as below 50 degrees and may only rise to approximately 50 degrees during their summers (Business Insider, 2015). The Aurignacoid (upper Paleolithic tool-making) tradition of the modern people is most associated with a feature called blade-and-core technology. According to Quaternary scientist C.V. Haynes, Arctic cave art also dates back to the Aurignacoid phase and climaxes during the end of the Pleistocene, which encompasses subjects such as hunting and spirituality. People stemming from the Clovis culture populated northern regions of Canada and formed what led to the Northern Archaic and Maritime Archaic traditions at the end of the Late Glacial period. Recently, small flint tools and artifacts from about 5,000 years ago were discovered that belonged to a culture now generally called the Arctic Small Tool tradition. The ASTt people are believed to be the physical and cultural ancestors of modern arctic Inuit.*Young, Steven B. To the Arctic: An Introduction to the Far Northern World. New York: Wiley, 1989. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, as European trade interests among the Northwest Company and the Hudson's Bay Company expanded into northern Canada, arctic indigenous peoples began to become more involved in the trade process. Increasingly more European goods, including kettles, iron tools, tobacco, alcohol, and guns, were bought and traded by the indigenous peoples within their communities. European imports in exchange for more primitive, native resources and tools made life for the indigenous more efficient and comfortable. Native societies in the early eighteenth century also began to buy guns from European traders, and these guns made hunting easier. They were also occasionally used in native etiquette, medicinal, and religious practices. Because of the natives' increased hunting efficiency, scarcity of resources became an issue in the region, a version of what American human ecologist Garrett Hardin called \\"the tragedy of the commons.\\"Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007. pgs. 64-72. The Arctic peoples value spiritual connections with their environment, which leads to a spiritual understanding along with their scientific understanding. Their lifestyles, therefore, reflect not only activity that is economically efficient but also that which is in line with their spiritual beliefs and values. The Alaskan Athabascan people, for example, spiritually value the moose. State law acknowledges this spiritual belief and allows people to take moose for potlatches outside of the usual hunting season. The indigenous peoples of the Arctic drawn from scientific, emotional and spiritual sources of information, which often does not agree with non-indigenous scientific observations.UNESCO. Climate Change and Arctic Sustainable Development: scientific, social, cultural and educational challenges. Paris: UNESCO, 2009. pgs. 73-75. Conservation and environmental issues Suspected worldwide anthropogenic climate change has been particularly evident in the Arctic. This is evident by warmer temperatures, melting glaciers, shorter durations of sea ice and changing weather and storm patterns. Scientists are especially concerned about four aspects of the continued projected warming of the Arctic. First, thermohaline circulation is a series of underwater oceanic currents fueled by the salinity and temperature of seawater. Melting ice sheets would introduce vast amounts of fresh water into the North Atlantic, causing a change in density which could disrupt the currents. If this circulation slowed or stopped, the climates of northern Europe and North America would be strongly impacted. Second, the melting of glaciers and sea ice is disrupting the lifestyles of a wide range of species. Polar bears live on the sea ice for much of the year and find their food in the surrounding ocean waters. Recent projections suggest that global warming will lead to the disappearance of most summer sea ice within 40 years. A third practical concern is the melting of permafrost due to climate change. Degradation of this permafrost is leading to major ground surface subsidence and pounding. The ground is literally melting away in many regions of the Arctic. The locations of towns and communities that have been inhabited for centuries are now in jeopardy. A condition known as drunken tree syndrome is being caused by this melting. Ground water and river runoffs are being negatively impacted as well. Although warming conditions might increase uptake for photosynthetic organisms in some places, scientists are concerned that melting permafrost will also release large amounts of carbon locked in permafrost. Higher temperatures increase soil decomposition and if soil decomposition becomes higher than net primary production, global atmospheric carbon dioxide will in turn increase. Atmospheric sinks in the water table are also being reduced as the permafrost melts and decreases the height of the water table in the Arctic.Oechel, Walter and George Vourlitis. ‚ÄúThe Effects of Climate Charge on Land‚ÄîAtmosphere Feedbacks in Arctic Tundra Regions.‚Äù Trends in Ecology & Evolution 9 (1994): 324-329. Accessed on February 23, 2014. Doi: 10.1016/0169-5347(94)90152-X. Finally, the impacts of the release of carbon from the permafrost could be amplified by high levels of deforestation in the Boreal forests in Eurasia and Canada. This biome currently serves as a large carbon sink, sequestering large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, over half of the original forest has been or in danger of harvesting, largely for export. Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which facilitates increased warming of the earth. Further exploration In a meta analysis of the published work in aquatic ecosystems since the term biodiversity appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to be still unexplored. In addition, the North Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and Pacific Northwest), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world‚Äôs aquatic biodiversity. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in terrestrial ecosystems, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially marine ecosystems where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases (Moustakas & Karakassis 2005). Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Arctic Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world‚Äôs aquatic biodiversity.

The club serves the two parishes of Cummer and Kilmoylan and Belclare. Corofin are the 2019‚Äì20 All-Ireland Club Champions, after winning their third-successive All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship final by defeating Kilcoo of Down in January 2020. History The club has had a long association with the GAA dating back as far as its inception. Corofin born and long time local parish priest, Dr Patrick Duggan, who was then Bishop of Clonfert was Michael Cusack's first choice to be the clerical patron of the new association in 1884. However, the Bishop (then 71 years of age) declined the invitation on health grounds, and directed the delegation to the more youthful Dr Croke the Archbishop of Cashel. The current club was formed in 1925 as a result of an amalgamation between Corofin and Belclare. With the disruption of war and emigration in the first two decades of the 20th century, it was increasingly difficult for the two rural clubs to be competitive against the town teams. The name of the new club was decided when Corofin (captained by Tom Molloy) defeated Belclare (captained by Hubert McHugh) in a game in Anbally on Easter Sunday, 12 April 1925. It was also in 1925 that Tom Molloy became the first man from the parish to win an All-Ireland senior football medal. Molloy went on to train Galway to win the 1934 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final and the Roscommon team in the 1940s to All- Ireland successes. Later years Of the club's 21 Galway Senior Football Championship title wins, 18 of these have been since 1991. The club has also won 10 Connacht Senior Club Football Championship titles. In 1998, 2015, 2018 2019 and 2020 the club won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship. Corofin won the 2019 Galway Senior Football Championship, defeating Tuam Stars in a replay on a scoreline of 11 points to 8 points.

School hooligans Petrov and Vasechkin go to Young Pioneer camp for summer vacation. The community of the Camp waits for cool hooligan \\"Goose\\" and thinks Vasechkin is \\"Goose\\", like in The Government Inspector. Plot =Introduction= The children are planning to stage Nikolai Gogol's play The Government Inspector and listen to the reading by teacher Inna Andreevna. The general consensus amounts to the fact that while the play is good, it is out of date - it seems to the children that such a situation would nowadays be impossible. The teacher suggests that the action of the classical work to be moved to a modern pioneer camp . =\\"Hooligan (almost based on Gogol)\\"= The chairman of the council of the squad Anton receives from his friend a letter with a warning that a famous hooligan named \\"Goose\\" is about to come to the camp. Behind him, three boys march on the advice of the squad - Artem (head of the sports section), Alik (head of the chess section) and Lyosha (responsible for the camp wall newspaper ), and two girls - Olya Dobkina and Olya Bobkina (an allusion to Bobchinsky and Dobchinsky ) - eavesdrop at the door of the room where the council passes. The guys are not very happy about the arrival of the bully, since he can break the whole plan of educational work. Nevertheless, Anton proposes to exert every effort to re-educate the malicious hooligan, and his arrival is kept a secret for as long as possible so that there will be no panic in the camp. Nevertheless, Dobkin and Bobkin immediately spread news about the bully throughout the camp. At this time, Petrov and Vasechkin arrive in the camp, who come there not on their own will - during the summer holidays they just want to rest, and the camp program with numerous sections and circles makes them depressed. Nevertheless, for the joy of the children it turns out that the head of the camp is their class teacher Inna Andreevna. Dobkin and Bobkin decide that Vasechkin is that hooligan, and Petrov is his accomplice. Petya and Vasya at first do not understand why Anton and the others are so in a hurry to help them, but figuring out what's wrong Vasechkin persuades the friend to exploit the image of the hooligans. Anton decides that the energy of Vasechkin-hooligan needs to be redirected to the right track, and the pair begins to be persecuted by the heads of various sections and circles. Vasechkin decides to confess in everything only to Dashenka, the local winner of ballroom dancing, and Anka to the commander of the local detachment \\"Search\\". But they do not believe him - Dasha, being a romantic nature, believes that Vasechkin simply refuses to admit to being a bully, and Anka, who has a sense of collectivity in her heart, recognizes Vasechkin's accusation as an attempt at licentiousness, so that he will soon be accepted into the camp team. During all this, Petrov writes a letter to Masha Startseva, who at that moment is at the competitions. The guys try to confess to Alik, but he becomes frightened and even without listening to them, climbs onto the flagpole . Realizing that the other guys will not listen to them, the couple decides to secretly escape from the camp. During the escape Petrov accidentally drops his letter to Masha. The letter is picked up by Olya Bobkina, who at that moment was hurrying to the meeting of the council of the squadron, where Anton and the others summed up the first results of their attempts to re-educate the \\"hooligan\\". She reads the letter and, arriving at the meeting, shows it to Anton. Realizing that they have been wrong all this time, Dasha and Anka are reproaching themselves for not believing Vasechkin, and the other guys are blaming Dobkin and Bobkin for what happened. In the midst of discussions, local sports judge Filipp rushes into the room, informing him that the real \\"Goose\\" has arrived at the camp. On this, Inna Andreevna completes her modern interpretation of the play, but the guys do not like this ending. Real Petrov and Vasechkin offer their finale. The guys decide to escape from the camp along the beach, but they come across Goose. A fight breaks out between them. The whole camp runs to the noise of the struggle, and the exhausted and beaten guys fall from fatigue to the sand. They are taken to the medical center, where the children are discouraged. Although they are still all served (only now as a victim), the boys discover that they are already very tired of all this rest. Vasechkin at some point says that he dreams of a \\"game for life.\\" Their discouragement fades to a bit when Masha Startseva comes to the camp. As a gift, she brings Don Quixote by Cervantes to the boys . Vasechkin, after reading it a little, says only one word to Petrov: \\"Idea! \\". =\\"The Knight\\"= In the second part, the plot of Don Quixote by Cervantes is played out. Late at night Vasechkin comes to Inna Andreyevna with a request that she accept him as a knight. Inna Andreevna thinks that Petya is ill, but he starts to quote the monologue of Don Quixote in response.An episode from the third chapter, where Don Quixote asks the innkeeper to knight him. At some point, Inna Andreyevna starts to see Vasechkin in the image of the real Don Quixote, and as a result, being impressed, the teacher \\"knights\\" the boy. Early in the morning, Vasechkin pulls Petrov out of bed, telling him that he came up with a \\"game for life.\\" They sit down on the tandem and go \\"to perform feats in honor of Dulcinea of Tobos\\" - Masha Startseva (they leave a note for her goodbye). Vasechkin commits a lot of hooliganism, considering it a feat. On the contrary, Petrov, meanwhile, does several good deeds. Petrov and Vasechkin find in the book a scene where Don Quixote takes a mill for a giant and decides to repeat this \\"feat\\", which turned out to be almost fatal for Vasechkin: after flying to the mill, Petya, along with the bike, hangs on her wing, then jumps off with the umbrella and flies away in an unknown direction. Petrov mourns his best friend and recognizes him as a real \\"knight\\", after which he mentally writes a letter to Masha, but unexpectedly finds Vasechkin in a well, unharmed. Vasya becomes a faithful assistant to Vasechkin, known as Sancho Panza . Meanwhile, in the camp, the staff worries about the loss of Petrov and Vasechkin. Goose comes to Masha Startseva and finds out where they went. After Masha comes Inna Andreevna. Both begin to blame themselves for the loss of boys, and go in search of a convertible UAZ-469 car. They are joined by the Goose and Filipp, who hid in the car. Petrov and Vasechkin go down to the road, see stones on the road, and 102-year-old oldman Nodar strides toward him. Petrov decides to help him in clearing the road. Vasechkin hurries to commit his next \\"feats\\", but instead disturbs a shepherd, whose dog he took for a wolf. After meeting with oldman Nodar, the guys meet with small black-haired Manana, a local girl. Petrov and Vasechkin begin to behave as investigators, questioning her, if anyone has offended her, and as a result get acquainted with the grandmother of the girl, a lonely woman who immediately gives the work to the children. Together with Manana, Vasechkin goes for water, but on the way back he encounters the cow of Manana, and, taking it for a wild bull, fights with it, but eventually runs away and climbs up a tree. Together with Manana, they are found by Petrov and grandmother. Further, Petrov and Vasechkin see mountains and climbers descending down the rope. One of the climbers explains to the guys that at the top of the mountain grows edelweiss, which according to tradition is given only to a beautiful woman. The guys had an idea to give edelweiss to Masha Startseva, and Vasechkin goes for the flower, but never reaches it. The climbers invite the guys to their lodgings for the night, and by the fire Vasechkin sings a song. During the performance, Vasechkin imagines a duel between Gus and Vasechkin for Masha, where Vasechkin receives a mortal wound, and Masha comes to mourn him. In the meantime, Inna Andreevna and Masha tearfully worries about the guys. And Masha imagines a similar duel between Goose and Vasechkin, but in her imagination she comes running and covers Vasechkin with her body, and receives a mortal wound - respectively, they lament her now. In the morning Petrov ascends to the top of the mountain, takes the edelweiss and puts it in the tent. Eventually, Inna Andreevna, Masha and Goose find the tent with Petrov and Vasechkin, and before returning to the camp, Petrov gives Masha the flower.

The Convention, negotiated pursuant to a mandate from the OAS Foreign Ministers shortly after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, reflects the Americas' hemispheric-wide commitment to enhancing cooperation in the fight against terrorism. In brief, the Convention: *Improves regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism, thereby enhancing hemispheric security. *Commits parties to endeavor to sign and ratify the relevant U.N. anti-terrorism instruments (a major element in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373). *Commits parties to use the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and other specialized entities as guidelines in taking measures to prevent, combat and eradicate the financing of terrorism. *Denies safe haven to suspected terrorists, both as refugees and asylum-seekers, and denies use of the political offense exception by suspected terrorists to prevent extradition or rendering of mutual legal assistance. *Extends the terrorist acts covered under the relevant U.N. anti-terrorism instruments to financial crimes (e.g., money laundering) and other provisions of the U.N.'s Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. The OAS Convention thus elaborates for regional use a variety of legal tools that have proven effective against transnational organized crime in recent years. *Enhances cooperation in a number of areas, including: exchanges of information on border control measures and law enforcement actions; appointment of a single national point of contact as liaison with other states and relevant bodies; exchanges of experience and training; technical assistance; and mutual legal assistance. *Demonstrates regional solidarity in fight against terrorism. *Facilitates the implementation of a number of the mandates in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373 and expands the signatory states' ability to act upon some of the recommendations set forth in the Resolution. , the Convention has been signed by 33 of the 34 active member states and ratified by 24.

The headlines include the three most considerable news of the day. The two editions are broadcast from the same studio in the RAI broadcasting house in Bolzano and are both hosted by the same presenter. Four presenters alternately host the newscast. The Tagesschau team covers news directly from South Tyrol, including specific issues concerning neighbouring regions and from Rome for national politics, where a correspondent is located. Reports over other current events from Italy or news from Europe and the World are recorded by the Tagesschau team in Bolzano using pictures from Italian RAI newscasts or from the EBU Network. The last broadcast edition can also be watched in full as a video stream from the RAI Sender Bozen web page. =Tagesschau at 8PM= The main edition is the highest rated television programme in the province and normally covers news from Italy (mainly national politics), Europe and the World in the first part (about 5‚Äì7 minutes), while news from South Tyrol are in the second part of the newscast.

It existed from the Kingdom's formation in December 1918, until its surrender to the Axis powers on 17 April 1941. Aside from fighting along the Austrian border in 1919‚Äì20 related to territorial disputes, and some border skirmishes on its southern borders in the 1920s, the JV was not involved in fighting until April 1941 when it was quickly overcome by the German-led invasion of Yugoslavia. Shortly before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, certain high ranking army and airforce officers, backed by Great Britain, staged a coup against the Yugoslav monarchy on 27 March. Beyond the problems of inadequate equipment and incomplete mobilization, the Royal Yugoslav Army suffered badly from the Serbo-Croat schism in Yugoslav politics. \\"Yugoslav\\" resistance to the invasion collapsed overnight. The main reason was that neither of the non-Serb national groups (Slovenes and Croats) were prepared to fight in defence of what they viewed as Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia. The only effective opposition to the invasion was from wholly Serbian units within the borders of Serbia itself. In its worst expression, Yugoslavia's defenses were badly compromised on 10 April 1941, when some of the units in the Croatian-manned 4th and 7th Armies mutinied, and a newly formed Croatian government hailed the entry of the Germans into Zagreb the same day.Times Atlas, p.54 During the occupation of Yugoslavia, the Chetniks of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá were referred to as the \\"Yugoslav Army in the Homeland\\". The Royal Yugoslav Army was formally disbanded on 7 March 1945 when the Yugoslav government-in-exile appointed by King Peter II was abolished. Background The Austro-Hungarian Army exited the First World War after the Armistice of Villa Giusti was struck with the Kingdom of Italy on 3 November 1918. A National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs had been formed in Zagreb in the previous month with the aim of representing the kingdoms of Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia, the condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Slavic-populated areas of Carniola and Styria. On 1 November 1918 the National Council had established the Department of National Defense, which brought all Austro-Hungarian units on its territory under the command of a new National Army of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. All affected units of the Common Army, the Imperial-Royal Landwehr and the Royal Croatian Home Guard came under that unified command. Immediately after the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Italy began occupying parts of the Kingdom of Dalmatia that had been promised to it under the secret Treaty of London. On 1 December 1918 the unification of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs with the Kingdom of Serbia was declared, forming the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Kingdom of Montenegro had already united with Serbia five days earlier. This declaration and firm action by armed groups halted any further encroachments by Italy. The National Council subsequently organised a celebration in Zagreb on 5 December with a Te Deum at the Zagreb Cathedral. Members of the 25th Croatian Home Guard Infantry Regiment and the 53rd Infantry Division held a protest at the same time at the nearby Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square. The protest was quelled by the police with 15 dead and 17 injured. Both units were subsequently demobilised and disbanded. Formation to 1926 At the end of 1918, a Serbian Army mission led by Milan Pribiƒáeviƒá, Du≈°an Simoviƒá and Milisav Antonijeviƒá arrived in Zagreb to lead the re-organisation of the Serbian Army and the National Army of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs into a single new Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS). By 1 January 1919, a total of 134 former high-ranking Austro-Hungarian officers had been retired or relieved of their duties. From late 1918 until 10 September 1919, the new army was involved in a sharp military confrontation with irregular pro-Austrian formations in the region of Carinthia on the northern frontier of the new KSCS. At one point, KSCS troops briefly occupied Klagenfurt. After a plebiscite in October 1920 the frontier with Austria was fixed and tensions subsided. Yugoslav soldiers in 1925 By early 1921 the army organisation had settled into one cavalry division of four regiments, 16 infantry divisions, each consisting of three infantry regiments and one artillery regiment, and additional army-level troops. The 16 infantry divisions were grouped into four numbered army areas, with headquarters at Novi Sad (1st Army), Sarajevo (2nd Army), Skoplje (3rd Army), and Zagreb (4th Army). Later in 1921, a second cavalry division was formed using the four army-level cavalry regiments. Artillery allocation was one heavy artillery regiment and one howitzer regiment at army level, and one field artillery regiment at infantry division level. The army was based on conscription, and annual call-ups were used to maintain the peacetime strength of the army at 140,000. Of the four armies, two were equipped with French-pattern rifles, and the other two used an Austrian model. In the early 1920s, the army responded to several external crises, including the attempted return of King Charles IV to neighbouring Hungary, disturbances along the Albanian border, and incursions from Bulgaria. Despite high standards of discipline and individual training, the army was unable to conduct large-scale mobilisation due to threats on all frontiers, lack of funds, poor railway infrastructure, lack of suitably trained and qualified officers, and shortage of arms, munitions, clothing and equipment. In 1922, the allocation of artillery within the army was enhanced using material captured in World War I. The result was that the army-level artillery was stripped of its howitzer regiments, which were used to increase the division-level field artillery regiments to brigade strength in eight of the 16 infantry divisions. In the same year, the peacetime strength of the army was reduced to 100,000, and the Ministry of War was trimmed by handing over the frontier troops to the Minister of Finance and transferring the gendarmerie to the Ministry of Interior. From the earliest days of the army, a clique of officers known as the White Hand, were actively engaged in politics. In 1923, the liability for service in the army were changed so that all citizens were liable to service from 21 to 50 years of age, in the active army from 21 to 40 years of age and in the reserve army from 40 to 50 years of age. Service in the standing army was set at one-and-a-half years, and three general ranks were introduced instead of the previous single rank. One year after their disbandment, border disturbances made it necessary to reconstitute a smaller contingent of frontier troops in the 3rd Army area. A total of 32 companies were therefore raised and stationed along the borders with Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. In 1923, the only non-Serb generals in the army retired, and the number of generals in the army was increased from 26 to more than 100 by the promotion of colonels into the lower general ranks of brigadni ƒëeneral (brigadier general) and divizijski ƒëeneral (divisional general). In 1924, the artillery strength of the remaining eight infantry divisions were brought up to brigade strength. In 1925, a Guards division was formed, consisting of two regiments of cavalry, and one regiment each of infantry and artillery. It was commanded by Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá, a founder of the White Hand. The first significant acquisition of military aircraft were made in the same year, with 150 Breguet 19 light bomber and aerial reconnaissance biplanes being purchased from France under the terms of a loan. Extensions were also made to the arsenal at Kragujevac in 1925, but the previous deficiencies in the army continued to plague the force, with the result that despite its size, the army could not be expected to contend with a smaller and more modern force for any significant time. In 1926, the 5th Army was created, utilising two divisions from the 1st Army and one from the 4th Army. In the same year, 13 more companies of frontier troops were raised for deployment along the Hungarian and Italian borders, and 12 Dornier floatplanes were also purchased. 1927‚Äì1932 Royal Yugoslav Army officers' uniform The first manoeuvres of any significant size since the formation of the army in 1919 were conducted between the troops of two divisions during 29 September to 2 October 1927, although the number of troops engaged did not exceed 10,000 and some reserves had to be called up to achieve this number. Prior to this, only local inter- garrison exercises had been conducted. The method adopted for the exercises and the tactics used were similar to those used by the British Army before the Second Boer War. In 1928, four new infantry regiments were established in response to an Italian buildup along the frontier. These were seen as the nucleus for a potential new infantry division. The arsenal at Kragujevac also went into operation, producing Mauser M24 series rifles and ammunition. In January 1929, King Alexander established a personal dictatorship and appointed ≈Ωivkoviƒá as Prime Minister. In April, thirty-two generals were forcibly retired, including the Chief of the General Staff, Petar Pe≈°iƒá. During that year, the army took delivery of 4,000 light machine guns, eighty field guns and 200,000 vz. 24 rifles from the Czech firm ≈†koda. The latter meant that the standing army could finally be equipped with a single type of rifle. The year also saw three inter-divisional exercises conducted, although reports indicated that they were poorly organised and carried out. In 1930, ≈Ωivkoviƒá was promoted to Armijski ƒëeneral, and four out of the five army commanders were changed. There was only one Croat or Slovene in the general ranks, and he was an engineer in an unimportant post. Acquisition of about 800 modern artillery pieces of various calibres was also undertaken, again from Czechoslovakia, and another 100,000 rifles were purchased from Belgium. Despite this new equipment, the army remained deficient in light and heavy machine guns, motor transport, signalling and bridging equipment, and tanks. Inter-division manoeuvres were again undertaken in three regions, but cavalry charges and massed infantry attacks demonstrated that the army had not learned the lessons of World War I. In the view of the British military attach√©, the clique of Serbian officers in charge of the army at this time were narrow- minded and conservative men who, while keen to modernise the equipment of the army, did not see the need to modernise its tactics or organisation, and were unwilling to learn from others. During following year, a machine gun company was created in each infantry battalion, and both the Savska (Zagreb) and Dravska (Ljubljana) divisions converted one of their infantry regiments into a mountain infantry regiment. This latter development was intended as the first step to creating two independent formations that, with integral artillery, signals and transport elements, could be used along the mountainous northwest frontier. The year saw no military exercises, even the recent inter-divisional manoeuvres being foregone due to the international financial crisis. The British military attach√© observed that the army lacked the sound system of battalion and regimental training needed to thoroughly prepare units for modern warfare, as training consisted mainly of close order drill, basic marksmanship and a small number of field firing exercises. In 1932, ≈Ωivkoviƒá resigned as Prime Minister and from official politics, and returned to the command of the Guards Division. Some communist activity was detected within the army during the year, and the same conservative group of senior Serb officers remained firmly in charge. The two independent mountain brigades completed formation in 1932, each provided with two batteries of guns. The exclusively Serb Chetnik organisation led by Kosta Peƒáanac formed new detachments in various parts of the country. From a military perspective, it was intended that the Chetniks would assist the frontier guards in peacetime, in addition to their traditional guerilla activities in times of war. Three anti-aircraft regiments were formed in the same year. 1933‚Äì1937 In early 1933, there was a war scare regarding Italy and Hungary which greatly concerned the General Staff. The British military attach√© observed that the army had great self-belief, its infantry was tough and its artillery was well- equipped, but it greatly lacked in significant areas required by a modern fighting force. Key deficiencies remained in machine guns and infantry guns, and there was no combined arms training. The attach√© further observed that, along with the almost complete Serb domination of the general ranks, the General Staff was also 90 per cent Serb, and \\"Serbianisation\\" of the army had continued, with young educated Croats and Slovenes now reluctant to enter the army. The attach√© saw the Serb domination of the army as a possible political weakness for the nation, but also a military weakness in time of war. Three Croat officers were promoted to the rank of brigadni ƒëeneral during the year. There were also reductions in the numbers of artillery regiments and batteries, and infantry battalions and companies, due to significantly lower conscription numbers for 1933, which were caused by the Balkan Wars twenty years earlier. Three more anti-aircraft regiments were formed, and an independent command was created for ≈†ibenik in Dalmatia. Long-term shortages in officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) remained, with deficiencies of 3,500 officers and 7,300 NCOs. Disturbances in the Macedonian region resulted in the issue of 25,000 rifles to members of the Serb-nationalist paramilitary force Narodna Odbrana. In June 1934, Army general Milan Nediƒá became Chief of the General Staff, replacing Milovanoviƒá. King Alexander appointed Nediƒá to carry through a significant change in army organisation against the opposition of many of the senior generals, mainly to reduce the size of the oversized infantry divisions and create corps as an intermediate formation between divisions and armies. After Alexander's assassination, Nediƒá decided to defer the changes, citing practical difficulties. A chemical warfare battalion was also formed, with the intention of providing each army with one company. Trials were also undertaken with Skoda tankettes and a locally designed automatic rifle. It was announced that army-level manoeuvres would be held in 1935, for the first time since the formation of the army in 1919. A commission formed to examine the issue of mechanisation of the army concluded that the terrain of much of the country and the weakness of existing bridges meant that motorisation and mechanisation should be developed slowly, but that a light truck should be acquired as a first step. Reserves of ammunition of all types were reported as low. In 1935, estimates were made that within a month of mobilisation, 800,000 to 900,000 soldiers could be placed under arms. This was based on the duplication of eight of the sixteen standing infantry divisions and of the alpine division, and the formation of an additional cavalry division, resulting in a total of 24 infantry divisions of about 25,000 men each, one guards division, two alpine divisions and three cavalry divisions. This year saw significant changes in the higher command of the army following the creation of the Military Council. Nediƒá became a member of the Military Council and was replaced by Army general Ljubomir Mariƒá as Chief of the General Staff. Six infantry regiments were disbanded, but the General Staff decided to stick with four infantry regiments per infantry division. Equipment received during the year included 800 Stokes mortars, enough Skoda anti-aircraft guns to arm 20 batteries, and six Skoda ≈†koda S-1d tankettes. Deficiencies in radio communications were apparent, with the infantry needing between 1,000 and 2,000 small sets, and the cavalry being completely lacking in radios. The radios issued to artillery units were unable to communicate with aircraft, and were therefore of little use. The British military attach√© observed that even the most senior commanders have never handled a force larger than a division on exercises or in war. The 1935 manouevres were the first of any type since 1930, and the first above divisional level since the formation of the army in 1919. They took place on the Sava river between Novi Sad and Sarajevo at the end of September, and were really in the form of a demonstration rather than a war game. There was no freedom of action for commanders, and control was rigid. During 1936, Mariƒá became Minister of the Army and Navy, replacing ≈Ωivkoviƒá, who had been intriguing against the government. Before this occurred Mariƒá had told the British naval and military attach√©s that any mobilisation of the army would take 25 days, and revealed that shortfalls in many items of equipment were severe, including gas masks, steel helmets, tents, horseshoes, small arms ammunition, saddlery and tanks. The new Chief of the General Staff was Armijski ƒëeneral Milutin Nediƒá, brother of Milan, who had been the General Officer Commanding the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The major organisational change during the year was the formation of a tank battalion, consisting of three companies, each of three platoons of five tanks. The only tankettes in service at this time were Renault FTs operated by a training company, but an order for new tanks had been submitted. Large-scale manoeuvres were carried out in Slovenia in September 1937, involving the equivalent of four divisions, and exposing to foreign observers the serious deficiencies in the army, caused by incompetent General Staff and the senior commanders, a lack of technical training of regimental officers in modern warfare, and across-the-board shortages of arms and equipment of almost every type. The British military attach√© observed that the army was not capable of undertaking any large-scale operations outside of the country, but if fully mobilised would be able to give a good account of itself in a defensive campaign. The exercise was conducted in Slovenia to test the loyalty and value of Slovene and Croat reservists, and was completely satisfactory in this respect only, with nearly all of the reservists reporting for duty and bearing the hardships of the exercise with \\"discipline and fortitude\\". The same year saw the delivery of a substantial amount of equipment from Czechoslovakia, including 36 mountain guns, 32 anti-aircraft guns, 60 reconditioned howitzers, 80 field guns, and eight ≈†koda S-1d tankettes. Considerable work was being undertaken building fortifications on the Italian frontier. Prelude to war During 1938, Milutin Nediƒá was appointed as Minister of the Army and Navy, and was replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Armijski ƒëeneral Du≈°an Simoviƒá. That year, two geo-strategic changes made the task of the army significantly more difficult, the Anschluss between Germany and Austria, and the Munich Agreement which drastically weakened Czechoslovakia. These changes meant that Yugoslavia now had a common frontier with Germany and its most significant supplier of arms and munitions was under threat. It was the assessment of the British military attach√© that the army could stem the tide of an invasion by one of its neighbours acting alone, with the possible exception of Germany, and could also deal with a combined Italian and Hungarian attack. During the year, a Coastal Defence Command was raised using troops already stationed along the Yugoslav coastline, and did not involve the creation of new formations. Delivery of 10,000 light machine guns from Czechoslovakia was completed during the year, which meant that the army was fully equipped with rifles and light machine guns. Further fortification was undertaken along the Italian border, and plans were developed to fortify the former Austrian border. Of the 165 generals in the army in 1938, two were Croats and two were Slovenes, the rest were Serbs. During the interwar period, the Yugoslav military budget expended 30 per cent of government outlays. By January 1939, the army, when mobilised, and including reserves, numbered 1,457,760 men, with fighting formations including 30 infantry divisions, one guards division, and three cavalry divisions. In late 1940, the army mobilised troops in Macedonia and parts of Serbia along the border with Albania.  April 1941 Campaign  A map of the invasion of Yugoslavia, April 1941 Formed after World War I, the Royal Yugoslav Army was still largely equipped with weapons and material from that era, although some modernization with Czech equipment and vehicles had begun. Of about 4,000 artillery pieces, many were aged and horse-drawn, but about 1,700 were relatively modern, including 812 Czech 37mm and 47mm anti-tank guns. There were also about 2,300 mortars, including 1,600 modern pieces, as well as twenty-four and pieces. Of 940 anti-aircraft guns, 360 were and Czech and Italian models. All of these arms were imported, from different sources, which meant that the various models often lacked proper repair and maintenance facilities. The only mechanized units were 6 motorized infantry battalions in the three cavalry divisions, six motorized artillery regiments, two tank battalions equipped with 110 tanks, one of which had Renault FT models of World War I origin and the other 54 modern French Renault R35 tanks, plus an independent tank company with eight Czech SI-D tank destroyers. Some 1,000 trucks for military purposes had been imported from the United States in the months just preceding the invasion.Tomasevich, 1975, p. 59. Fully mobilized, the Royal Yugoslav Army could have put 28 infantry divisions, three cavalry divisions, and 35 independent regiments in the field. Of the independent regiments, 16 were in frontier fortifications and 19 were organized as combined detachments, around the size of a reinforced brigade. Each detachment had one to three infantry regiments and one to three artillery battalions, with three organised as \\"alpine\\" units. The German attack, however, caught the army still mobilizing, and only some eleven divisions were in their planned defense positions at the start of the invasion. The units were filled to between 70 and 90 percent of their strength as mobilization was not completed. The strength of the Royal Yugoslav Army was about 1,200,000 as the German invasion got underway.Fatutta, et al., 1975. On the eve of the invasion, there were 167 Generals on the Yugoslav active list. Of these, 150 were Serbs, 8 Croats, and 9 Slovenes.Bjelajac, p. 353 The Royal Yugoslav Army was organized into three army groups and the coastal defense troops. The 3rd Army Group was the strongest with the 3rd, 3rd Territorial, 5th and 6th Armies defending the borders with Romania, Bulgaria and Albania. The 2nd Army Group with the 1st and 2nd Armies, defended the region between the Iron Gates and the Drava River. The 1st Army Group with the 4th and 7th Armies, composed mainly of Croatian troops, was in Croatia and Slovenia defending the Italian, German (Austrian) and Hungarian frontiers.Geschichte, pp. 317‚Äì318 The strength of each \\"Army\\" amounted to little more than a corps, with the three Army Groups consisting of the units deployed as follows; The 3rd Army Group's 3rd Army consisted of four infantry divisions and one cavalry detachment; the 3rd Territorial Army with three infantry divisions and one independent motorized artillery regiment; the 5th Army with four infantry divisions, one cavalry division, two detachments and one independent motorized artillery regiment and the 6th Army with three infantry divisions, the two Royal Guards detachments and three infantry detachments. The 2nd Army Group's 1st Army had one infantry and one cavalry division, three detachments and six frontier defence regiments; the 2nd Army had three infantry divisions and one frontier defence regiment. Finally, the 1st Army Group consisted of the 4th Army, with three infantry divisions and one detachment, whilst the 7th Army had two infantry divisions, one cavalry division, three mountain detachments, two infantry detachments and nine frontier defence regiments. The Strategic, \\"Supreme Command\\" Reserve in Bosnia comprised four infantry divisions, four independent infantry regiments, one tank battalion, two motorized engineer battalions, two motorized heavy artillery regiments, fifteen independent artillery battalions and two independent anti-aircraft artillery battalions. The Coastal Defence Force, on the Adriatic opposite Zadar comprised one infantry division and two detachments, in addition to fortress brigades and anti-aircraft units at ≈†ibenik and Kotor.Fatutta, et al., 1975. p.52. Along with other Yugoslav forces, the Royal Yugoslav Army surrendered on 17 April 1941 to an invading force of Germans, Italians, and Hungarians. Subsequently, a unit titled \\"1st Battalion, Royal Yugoslav Guards\\" was formed in Alexandria, Egypt.

There were at least three (and possibly as many as five) citiesThe circumstance that there were so many towns called Hybla in Sicily probably arose from the fact mentioned by Pausanias, that there was a local divinity of the name. (Paus. v. 23. ¬ß 6.) named \\"Hybla\\" in ancient accounts of Sicily which are often confounded with each other, and which it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish.William Smith, Britain's foremost classicist of the 19th century, begins to describe Hybla Major with an admixture of locational and historic information from both Hybla Gereatis and Megara Hyblaea. Caution should therefore be used when assuming reference to \\"Hybla\\" in an ancient source refers to this city. Hybla Gereatis has been described as the largest and most considerable of the Sicilian cities called Hybla, thence equated with Hybla Major or Magna., Steph. B.; Paus. v. 23 ¬ß 6: on coins, the name appears : Eckhel, vol. i. p. 216.However, Smith's identification is doubtful based on his general confusion of the synonymous cities. Pausanias (in whose time it had ceased to be an independent city) described the city as situated in the territory of Catana (modern Catania). l. c. In like manner, we find it noticed by Thucydides as a place between Catana and Centuripa (modern Centuripe), so that the Athenians, on their return from an expedition to the latter city, ravaged the corn fields of the Inessaeans and Hyblaeans.Thuc. vi. 96. It was clearly a Siculian city; and hence, at an earlier period, it is mentioned among the other towns of that people in the interior of the island which Ducetius sought to unite into a common league, a measure to which the Hyblaeans alone refused to accede.Diod. xi. 88. It is quite clear that, in all the above passages, the Aetnaean Hybla is the one meant: and it seems probable that the city of Hybla, which was attacked by the Athenians soon after their landing in Sicily (Thuc. vi. 62), but without success, was no other, but only Thucydides distinguishes the Hybla as Hybla Geleatis ()Which Smith takes to be an epithet generally supposed to belong to Hybla Minor. During the Second Punic War, Livy mentions Hybla as one of the towns that were induced to revolt to the Carthaginians in 211 BCE, but were quickly recovered by the Roman praetor M. Cornelius.Livy xxvi. 21. In the time of Cicero the Hyblenses (evidently the people of the Aetnaean city) appear as a considerable municipal community, with a territory fertile in corn: Cicero In Verrem iii. 4. 3. and Hybla is one of the few places in the interior of Sicily which Pomponius Mela thinks worthy of mention. Its name is also found both in Pliny, who reckons it among the populi stipendiarii of the island, and in Ptolemy. Hence it is strange that Pausanias appears to speak of it as in his time utterly desolate. The passage, however, is altogether so confused that it is very difficult to say of which Hybla he is there speaking.Mel. ii. 7. ¬ß 16; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol. iii. 4. ¬ß 14; Paus. v. 23. ¬ß 6. We find no later notice of it, though an inscription of Christian times found at Catana appears to refer to Hybla as still existing under its ancient name.Castell. Inscr. Sicil. p. 253, no. 42. The site, as suggested by Cluverius, at Patern√≤ (about 20 km from Catania), and derives strong confirmation from the discovery in that city of an altar dedicated Veneri Victrici Hyblensi.Cluverius Sicil. p. 235; Castell. Num. Vet. Sicil. p. 36.) There is much confounding of this city with that of Aetna.

Retrieved 15 April 2016. History In one of those curious twists of history, this actually pre-dates Belgium itself by some 16 years. British Guards officers performed the honours, playing a match shortly before the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Matches have been played to mark the 150th, 175th and 200th anniversaries of this occasion. The first record of organized cricket, however, can be found in a painting (left) dated 1870 which now hangs in the Pavilion at Lord‚Äùs. Registered under Belgian law as a non-profit organization and operating as Cricket Belgium, it is the second Belgian Cricket Federation. The first was formed in the early 1900s and disappeared on the death of its long-term official Comte Joseph d‚ÄôOultremont in October 1942. No records have been found. Formed again in 1990, Belgium gained the status of an affiliate member of the ICC in 1991. The present Belgian Cricket Federation was a founding member of the European Cricket Council (ECC) and is now an Associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Belgian Olympic and Inter-federal Committee (BOIC). Although cricket is thought to have originated in what is now Belgium in about the 14th century, the first recorded match was played at Enghien six days before the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Mission and Vision Given below is how Belgian cricket has defined its Mission Statement As the governing body of cricket in Belgium we serve the Belgian Cricket community by providing high quality opportunities for playing cricket, providing cricket development opportunities for all ages, provide targeted performance based support to member clubs, promote the game of Cricket in the different regions of Belgium, deliver ‚Äòmajor‚Äô cricketing events with an organized and competitive cricket league, is open to all irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity or disability and provide a social environment that welcomes playing members and non-playing enthusiasts alike. Given below is how Belgian cricket has defined its Vision Statement To promote and develop cricket in Belgium by increasing the visibility of the game by taking it to the schools and the local community, promote transparency of the federation‚Äôs functioning and maintain clear and sustained communication with the cricketing fraternity. Improve cricketing facilities/infrastructure across the country, create financial sustenance by actively working towards securing a sponsor to generate non-ICC income for funding cricket development in Belgium. Actively work towards establishing partnerships with local councils and the various national sports governing bodies in order to maximize the footprint of the game. Significantly improve the results of the national senior, junior and women‚Äôs team‚Äôs performances at European and Global level. Club cricket in Belgium More and more clubs were formed in the 1950s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Today, 18 clubs and one school are members of either the Belgian Cricket Federation or its regional Flemish organisation Cricket Vlaanderen. In addition, there are a number of teams representing businesses and other organizations playing in a mid-week T20 competition and other non-League events. International Cricket Matches On the European stage, Belgium has been a committed supporter of the ECC and ICC-Europe for many years with senior national teams taking part in championships and, since 2001, sending junior national sides to European Championships as well. Belgium is the current holder of the ICC-Europe Under-19 Division 2 title and has previously held Under-13 and Under-17 titles. In 2011 the senior focus will shift towards T20 cricket in preparation for the new ICC-Europe Championship format. Belgium hosted 12 countries for the ICC-Europe T20 Championships Division 2 in June 2013 and 5 nation European Cricket One-day U19 Tournament in August 2015.

It has been centuries since he last saw colors or even felt emotions. Although the mechanic Tempest Trine needs the job, she quickly realizes that in touring with Darius, she's bitten off more than she can chew. Tempest has always felt different, apart from others.

Brickearths are periglacial loess, a wind-blown dust deposited under extremely cold, dry, peri- or postglacial conditions. The name arises from its early use in making house bricks, its composition being suitable for brick-making without additional material being added and unlike clay its bricks can be hardened (fused) at lower temperatures, including in wood-fired kilns.

Brickearth typically occurs in discontinuous spreads, across southern England and South Wales, south of a line from Pembroke in the west to Essex in the east in depths of up to a metre. Commercially useful deposits of about 2m to 4m thick are present in Kent, Hertfordshire and Hampshire, overlying chalk, Thanet Beds or London Clay. The original deposition of the sediments occurred under cold climates where fluvial out- wash sediments from glaciers were subject to windy dry periods. The exposed finer-grained sediments were picked up and transported by the wind and were deposited wherever the wind strength decreased.Geodiversity Character Area Descriptions GCA 1 Tendring Plateau Geo-East Partnership Accessed April 2012 There are extensive brickearth deposits in Kent, particularly on the North Downs dip slope and on the Hoo peninsula, sections of the Medway and Stour valleys.

Taxonomy and systematics The family contains 11 species divided into 8 genera. * Oxylabes ‚Äì White-throated oxylabes * Bernieria ‚Äì Long-billed bernieria * Cryptosylvicola ‚Äì Cryptic warbler * Hartertula ‚Äì Wedge-tailed jery * Thamnornis ‚Äì Thamnornis * Xanthomixis ‚Äì (4 species) * Crossleyia ‚Äì Madagascan yellowbrow * Randia ‚Äì Rand's warbler Several of these species are very poorly known and were described by science only very recently. Appert's tetraka was only described in 1972 and the cryptic warbler in 1996. The Appert's tetraka, along with the dusky tetraka are threatened by habitat loss, and are listed as vulnerable. Most Malagasy warblers live in the humid rainforests in the east of Madagascar, though a few species are found in the drier south west of the island. They feed on insects and will form mixed-species feeding flocks of up to six species while foraging. References Further reading * Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D. (editors). (2006).

The duo are identical twin brothers, Billy and Bobby Alessi (born July 12, 1953, West Hempstead, New York). Career In their early teens, the brothers attended West Hempstead High School and formed the band The Country Gentlemen with schoolmate Don Droege and drummer Bob Pelicane. The band often played at a teen club called The Mod Scene and Long Island summer beach club gigs, as well as playing at other venues which included Murray the K's World in Roosevelt Field, the Raleigh Hotel in the Catskills, and The Caf√© Wha? in Greenwich Village. The band released one 45 single entitled \\"Saturday Night\\" which was credited to William Alessi. The Country Gentlemen in 1967 evolved into The Look and recorded the single \\"If I were A Carpenter\\" b/w \\"Can You Do\\" on Verve Records. In 1970, Billy and Bobby Alessi were working in the Broadway cast of Hair, when former Blues Magoos guitarist Peppy Castro also joined the show. The three formed the band Barnaby Bye and, with Mike Ricciardella on drums, the band were signed to Atlantic Records and released albums in 1972 (Room to Grow) and 1973 (Touch). The next Barnaby Bye album (Thrice Upon a Time) was not released until 2008, after the band reformed. After the early years with Barnaby Bye, the brothers continued writing, recording and performing as the duo, Alessi. In 1977, their song \\"Oh Lori\\" (from the 1976 album Alessi) reached no. 8 and spent 11 weeks in the UK Singles Chart, and became a Top Ten hit in seventeen more countries. In May 1982, \\"Put Away Your Love\\" (from the 1982 album Long Time Friends) reached No. 71 and spent four weeks in the US Billboard Hot 100. They also charted in Brazil with \\"Sad Songs\\" (from the album Alessi, 1977), \\"All for a Reason\\" (from the album All for a Reason, 1978) and \\"Forever\\" (recorded with Christopher Cross, from the album Long Time Friends, 1982). The first four Alessi albums (1976‚Äì1979) were released on the A&M; record label, with the fifth, Long Time Friends (1982) being on Quincy Jones's Qwest label. In 1984, Alessi released the track \\"Savin' the Day\\" for the soundtrack to the film Ghostbusters; this soundtrack album was released on the Arista label and was nominated for a Grammy Award for the Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special. Over the years Alessi have arranged, produced and/or written releases for many artists including Sir Paul McCartney, Deborah Gibson, Frankie Valli, Richie Havens, Olivia Newton John and Christopher Cross. The brothers toured with Andy Gibb in his 1978/79 Shadow Dancing tour and contributed background vocals to albums such as Art Garfunkel's 1979 album Fate for Breakfast and the John Lennon and Yoko Ono album Milk and Honey. Their songs have also been covered by artists including Peter Frampton and Rick Springfield and their songwriting and/or vocals have been featured in such films as The Main Event and Ghostbusters. The brothers have also had success working on jingles and advertisements for David Lucas and many mainstream consumer products in the United States. In the 2000s, they resumed their touring and album-recording career as a duo, with the new albums being released on the Eden Roc/Pink Records label. They also resumed touring and recording as part of the group Barnaby Bye and, in 2012, were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame. Their song \\"Seabird\\" was included in the music over the closing credits of Taika Waititi‚Äôs 2016 adventure-comedy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople.

It flows down the east side of the Cascade Range, through Wenatchee National Forest and the William O. Douglas Wilderness. From its source at Fish Lake near Crag Mountain, it flows northeast to Bumping Lake, a natural lake enlarged and regulated by Bumping Lake Dam. Below the dam, the Bumping River continues flowing northeast. It is joined by the American River, its main tributary, a few miles above its mouth where it joins the Little Naches River to form the Naches River. Bumping River is part of the Columbia River basin, being a tributary of the Naches River, which is tributary to the Yakima River, which is tributary to the Columbia River. Stockmen said that the river's name was given because during a freshet heavy boulders were carried down the river creating a rumbling vibration as the rocks kept bumping together. Variant names listed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the Bumping River include Tancum River and Tanum River.

It was discovered in 1775 by a British expedition under James Cook and so named by him because numerous islands (at least twelve) lie in the bay. Of South Georgia's 31 breeding bird species, 17 are found here.  Named features  The features around the Bay of Isles have been charted and named by a number of Antarctic expeditions since 1775. The bay is wide, and has a complex coastline that includes many subsidiary bays, coves, inlets, and other features, many of which have named headlands and points between them. The west coast of the Bay of Isles is roughly C-shaped. Its northernmost point is the rugged headland Cape Buller; Cleveland Rock sits nearby. Pyramid Peak rises over the cape. Just southeast of the cape sits Barlas Bank, a small submarine bank. At the top of the C-shape, Koppervik cove indents the north coast of the west side of the bay, with Breakwater Point marking the cove's west edge. Along the coast to the west are Sheathbill Bay, separated by a small cove from Rosita Harbour. Ram Head separates Rosita Harbour from Camp Bay to the south. In turn, Shag Point separates Camp Bay from Sunset Fjord, which forms the entirety of the southwest corner of the Bay of Isles. Just south of Shag Point within Sunset Fjord is Jock Point. Brunonia Glacier and Clayton Glacier both flow along Murphy Wall into Sunset Fjord. A colony of up to 60,000 King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) on Salisbury Plain at Ample Bay. Markham Point forms the west side of Ample Bay, which sits east of Sunset Fjord, along the south coast of the Bay of Isles. Just inside Markham Point is Paul Beach, a shingle beach long. It is tussock-covered at the higher levels, and backed by cliffs which extend eastward from Markham Point. East of the beach, Grace Glacier flows into Ample Bay, marking the west side of Salisbury Plain; Lucas Glacier marks the plain's east side. Continuing east along the south coast of the bay, Luck Point forms the west side of the entrance to Sea Leapord Fjord, a large fjord wide, bordered on the east side by Bellingshausen Point. Immediately east is Beckmann Fjord, whose easternmost side is marked by Daisy Point. Just off the entrance to Beckmann Fjord is Hecate Rock, a submerged rock with a least depth of . Austin Glacier flows northbound into Beckmann Fjord. Finally, the farthest east side of the Bay of Isles is marked by Cape Wilson. = Islands = The Bay of Isles is named for its numerous islands, many of which are named after local birds: * Albatross Island (albatross) * Crescent Island * Invisible Island * Mollyhawk Island (mollyhawk) * Skua Island (skua) * Petrel Island (petrel) * Prion Island (prion) * Tern Island (tern)  Charting and naming of features  Cape Buller was discovered and named in 1775 by a British expedition under James Cook. Markham Point was named on a 1912 chart by J. Innes Wilson. Beckmann Fjord, Bellingshausen Point, Brunonia Glacier, Cape Wilson, Grace Glacier, Lucas Glacier, Sea Leopard Fjord, and Sunset Fjord were charted in 1912-13 by Robert Cushman Murphy, who visited South Georgia in the brig Daisy. Beckmann Fjord was named for Captain Beckmann, master gunner of the whaler Don Ernesto, who lost his life in a whaling accident in December 1912. Bellingshausen Point was named for Admiral Thaddeus Bellingshausen. Murphy named Brunonia Glacier for his alma mater, Brown University, using a Latinized version of the name. Cape Wilson was named for American President Woodrow Wilson. Grace Glacier was named for Murphy's wife, Grace Barstow Murphy. He named Lucas Glacier for Frederic Augustus Lucas, then-director of the American Museum of Natural History. Sunset Fjord was named because he could see the sunset directly behind the fjord from his anchorage in the Bay of Isles. Ample Bay, Barlas Bank, Camp Bay, Jock Point, and Luck Point were charted and named by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel between 1928‚Äì30. Ample Bay was first sketched but not named by Murphy. Barlas Bank was named after William Barlas, the British representative at Deception Island and the South Shetland Islands. Camp Bay was named for a temporary camp set up on its southern shore. Jock Point wa named after Petty Officer J. \\"Jock\\" Purvis, a member of the DI hydrographic survey team. The name Koppervik was in use prior to 1930, probably by Norwegian whalers operating at South Georgia. The names Austin Glacier, Breakwater Point, Ram Head, and Shag Point first appear on a 1931 British Admiralty chart. Snowy sheathbill, namesake bird of Sheathbill Bay. The South Georgia Survey (SGS) of 1951-1957 has been responsible for selecting several names in and around the Bay of Isles. The SGS named Rosita Harbour after the company's whaling ship Rosita, which anchored in this bay, rejecting the alternate name Allardyce Harbour. In 1952, the SGS approved the name Daisy Point over Low Point, for the Daisy. Two members of the Falklands Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) occupied Paul Beach for research from 1953‚Äì54, and named the beach for the FIDS buoy-boat Southern Paul. Cleveland Rock was charted by the SGS, and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK- APC) in the 1980s for Benjamin D. Cleveland, captain of the Daisy. Clayton Glacier was named by UK-APC for geologist Roger A.S. Clayton of the British Antarctic Survey. Sheathbill Bay was named by UK-APC for the snowy sheathbills that live in the bay. Hecate Rock was named by UK-APC in 1984 after , which came very close to grounding on the rock during a hydrographic survey of the Bay of Isles in January‚ÄìFebruary, 1983.

The population as of the 2010 census was 10,072.Virginia Trend Report 2: State and Complete Places (Sub-state 2010 Census Data). Missouri Census Data Center. Accessed 2011-03-08. CountrySide is located about northwest of Washington and is bounded by the Potomac River to the north, and by Route 7 (Leesburg Pike) to the south. Located in eastern Loudoun County, it is about from Washington Dulles International Airport.  History  The CountrySide subdivision was conceived in the middle 1970s when a tract of 1,000 acres (4 km¬≤) of open farmland was subdivided in preparation for a planned housing development. Construction on homes began in 1981 and continued through 1991. Today, CountrySide covers about and consists of 2,539 homes, which includes 1,269 single-family homes, 1,168 town homes, and 102 Condominium units. Its population in 1990 was 8,349 residents, and the average household income was $118,500. Homes in CountrySide have a 20165 ZIP code. The majority of the homes in CountrySide were built by the homebuilder Pulte Homes, and are of the colonial architectural style. Most of the single-family homes have two stories and a basement. CountrySide is governed by the CountrySide Proprietary, the community's homeowners association.  Recreation  The community contains an extensive network of paved paths that wind through the wooded neighborhoods. It also contains three swimming pools. A network of smaller hiking trails branch off the main trail and are used for hiking, mountain biking, nature-watching and jogging. Some of the trails were developed by Eagle Scouts, others gradually by hikers; still others predate CountrySide itself. Planned integration with the Potomac Heritage Trail is in dispute despite the PHT's federally granted easement.  Schools  CountrySide students attend CountrySide Elementary School, Algonkian Elementary School, River Bend Middle School, and Potomac Falls High School.

She is presented as a cynical social climber who uses her charms to fascinate and seduce upper-class men. This is in contrast with the clinging, dependent Amelia Sedley, her friend from school. Becky then uses Amelia as a stepping stone to gain social position. Sharp functions as a picara‚Äîa picaresque heroine‚Äîby being a social outsider who is able to expose the manners of the upper gentry to ridicule. The book‚Äîand Sharp's career‚Äîbegins in a traditional manner of Victorian fiction, that of a young orphan (Sharp) with no source of income. who has to make her own way in the world. Thackeray twisted the Victorian tradition, however, and quickly turned her into a young woman who knew what she wanted from life‚Äîfine clothes, money and a social position‚Äîand knew how to get them. The route was to be by marriage, and the novel follows Sharp's efforts at snaring a wealthy, but simple, husband, and being outdone by fate in her attempt. Eventually, she achieves her aims, but her husband catches her with a member of the aristocracy. Finding herself in Brussels during the Waterloo campaign, as the mistress of a British general, she in no way shares in the alarm felt by other Britons; to the contrary, she soberly makes a contingency plan‚Äîshould the French win, she would strive to attach herself to one of Napoleon's marshals. It is probable that Thackeray based the Becky Sharp character on real women. A number of historical figures have been proposed, and it is generally considered that Sharp is a composite of them. Sharp has been portrayed on stage and in films and television multiple times between 1911 and 2018, and has been the subject of much scholarly debate on issues ranging from 19th-century social history, Victorian fashions, female psychology and gendered fiction. Context Rebecca Sharp‚Äîgenerally known as Becky‚Äîis the main character in Thackeray's satirical novel, Vanity Fair: A Novel Without A Hero, which was published incrementally between 1847 and 1848. Thackeray wished to counter the prevailing belief in society that it was impossible for women to create a fashionable self-image. Set in high regency society at the time of the Waterloo Campaign‚Äîin which three of the main male characters go to fight‚Äîthe book is a \\"vast satirical panorama of materialist society\\" and an early work of the realist school. A comedic and semi-historical novel, Vanity Fair brought its author immediate renown on its 1847 publication. According to 19th-century literary norms, the book's heroine should have been the upper-class Amelia Sedley; Thackeray, though, ensures that she is outshone by the lower-class Becky Sharp throughout. Sedley is a \\"dull and colourless foil\\"; she has all the positive traits that Sharp lacks, yet these bring her none of the benefits that Sharp experiences. Structurally, Amelia and Becky are joint-main characters, but as John P. Frazee points out, readers instinctively identify the latter as the sole protagonist due to her energy and forcefulness, while Amelia's colourlessness pushes her into the background. Sharp is shown to be continually on the lookout for a wealthy but simple husband who will indulge her while turning a blind eye to her associations. The book traces hers and Amelia's respective paths in life, from the finishing school where they first meet, through their marriages, to their respective middle age. =Synopsis= The story is framed as a puppet show taking place at an 1814 London fair and is narrated by a highly unreliable master of ceremonies who repeats gossip at second or third hand. Vanity Fair tells the story of Rebecca (\\"Becky\\") Sharp, the orphaned daughter of an English art teacher and a French dancer. She is a strong-willed, cunning, and moneyless young woman determined to make her way in society. After leaving school, Becky stays with Amelia (\\"Emmy\\") Sedley, the good-natured and ingenuous daughter of a wealthy London family. At Amelia's house, Becky meets the dashing and self-obsessed Captain George Osborne ‚Äî actually engaged to Amelia ‚Äî and Amelia's brother Joseph (\\"Jos\\") Sedley, a clumsy and vainglorious but rich civil servant home from the East India Company. Hoping to marry Sedley, the richest young man she has met, Becky entices him, but she fails. Osborne's friend, Captain William Dobbin, loves Amelia, but, putting her happiness first, does not attempt to compete with Osborne. Sharp goes into service with the crude and profligate baronet Sir Pitt Crawley, as governess to his daughters; she soon gains his favour. Sir Pitt's wife dies and he proposes to Becky. By then, though, she has married his son, Rawdon, which she soon regrets. Thackeray's illustration of Becky and Emmy as girls News arrives that Napoleon has escaped from Elba, and the stock market crashes, bankrupting Amelia's father. George's rich father forbids George to marry Amelia, because she is now poor. Dobbin persuades George to marry Amelia; George is disinherited. George, Dobbin and Rawdon are despatched to Brussels for the campaign. Osborne, tiring of Amelia, grows attracted to Becky. At the Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels, Becky embarrasses Amelia by making snide remarks about the quality of the latter's frock; meanwhile, the army receives marching orders to Waterloo. The battle can be heard from Brussels, but Becky is indifferent to the result, making plans for whoever wins (for example, if Napoleon wins, she decides, she intends to become the mistress of one of his Marshals) Osborne is killed, while Dobbin and Rawdon survive. Amelia lives in genteel poverty caring for their son. Becky also has a son, to whom she is cold and distant, being far more interested in first Paris and then London society where she meets the wealthy Marquis of Steyne, by whom she is eventually presented at court to the Prince Regent. She charms Steyne at a game of \\"acting charades\\" where she plays the roles of Clytemnestra and Philomela. This point is the peak of Becky's social success, but Rawdon is arrested for debt, possibly at Becky's connivance. Steyne had given Becky money, jewels, and other gifts, but she makes no effort to free her husband. When Rawdon is released, he finds Becky entertaining Steyne, whom Rawdon beats up, assuming the two to be having an affair. Steyne is indignant, having assumed the ¬£1000 he had just given Becky was part of an arrangement with her husband. Rawdon finds Becky's hidden bank records and leaves her, expecting Steyne to challenge him to a duel. Instead, Steyne arranges for Rawdon to be made Governor of Coventry Island, a pest-ridden location. Becky, having lost both husband and credibility, leaves England and wanders the continent, leaving her son in care. Amelia, Jos, George and Dobbin go to the fictional Pumpernickel (based on Weimar, Germany), where they find Becky destitute. She lives among card sharps and con artists, drinking heavily and gambling. Becky enchants Jos Sedley all over again, and Amelia is persuaded to let Becky join them. Becky decides that Amelia should marry Dobbin, notwithstanding that Dobbin is Becky's nemesis, the only person to ever see through her before it is too late. Amelia and Dobbin return to England, while Becky and Jos stay in France. Jos dies in suspicious circumstances ‚Äî likely poisoned ‚Äî shortly after signing much of his wealth to Becky, giving her an income. She returns to England and lives as a demi-mondaine. Her former associates refuse to have anything to do with her.  Character  For much of the book, due to her lower-class origins, Sharp is not treated as a social equal to her associates, who are at least middle if not upper class. She is \\"notoriously immoral\\" ‚Äî indeed, according to one commentator, she is the \\"embodiment of moral transgression\\"‚Äîwith a \\"ruthless determination ... but unfailing good temper\\". Her energy repeatedly creates a \\"whirlwind\\" around her. Sharp \\"manages to cheat, steal and lie without getting caught by the agents of social, moral and economic order who pursue her\\", which she does by creating for herself a new set of circumstances each time. This makes her \\"dangerous\\", in contemporary eyes, says Montz, and Sharp plays many such discrete roles throughout the book. However, each time she does reinvent herself in order to overcome the next adversity, her previous reputation always catches up with her. Jennifer Hedgecock has commented that: =Origins, appearance and personality= Born in Soho, Becky Sharp is the daughter of an impoverished English artist and a French \\"opera girl\\" ‚Äî possibly a prostitute ‚Äî and is thus half-French herself. To the English in the novel, her English ancestry is invisible; to them, she is wholly a Frenchwoman. She appears to have loved her father: Thackeray tells how, as a girl, she would sit with him \\"and [hear] the talk of many of his wild companions ‚Äî often but ill-suited for a girl to hear\\", and when he dies Sharp misses both his companionship and the freedom that she had living with him.Portrait photograph of left Sharp is a \\"flamboyant coquette\\" with bright green eyes. She is waif-like and attractive although not necessarily beautiful. A picara, she has talents for, and enjoyment of, acting, and is an excellent mimic. She has been described as \\"ever-adaptable\\" with a will to live and a vitality. However, she is also a duplicitous trickster, ‚Äî \\"an outlaw, female insubordination personified\\", says Marion Meade ‚Äî with an aggressive streak in her, who, however, never loses her femininity. She also has, says the Narrator, \\"wit, cleverness and flippancy\\", and a gift for \\"fun and mimicry\\". Sharp is, says Harold Bloom, \\"famously a bad woman, selfish and endlessly designing, rarely bothered by a concern for truth, morals, or the good of the community.\\" E. M. Forster describes Sharp as being \\"on the make\\"; for example, when she first sees Amelia's brother Jos, who is a revenue collector for the East India Company in Calcutta, she immediately asks Amelia whether he is very rich, because, \\"they say all Indian Nabobs are enormously rich\\". She is obsessed by money; unlike Amelia, who thinks that ¬£2,000 () will last her a lifetime, Sharp thinks that nothing less than ¬£5,000 () a year would be sufficient. Sharp's selfishness is even more highlighted when her husband is preparing to leave on the Waterloo campaign; she is more concerned that he has protected her income in case he is killed than over the risk to his life. Her subsequent attempt at appearing sorrowful at his departure is unrealistic to both her husband and the reader. The only time she cries for real is when she learns she could have married Sir Pitt Crawley, rather than, as she did, his son, whose fortunes were far less prosperous. \\"Her financial gains are always achieved through the exploitation of the affections of others\\", wrote Ulrich Knoepflmacher; Sharp understood, very early on, that sentiment is a profitable commodity and one to be used and disposed of when circumstances demanded it. Sharp knows what an English lady should look like, and her impersonation is impeccable: \\"dressed in white, with bare shoulders as white as snow‚Äîthe picture of youth, unprotected innocence and humble virgin simplicity\\". She understands the power that a fashionable appearance brings; \\"and revels in it\\", says Montz; thus she deliberately stages tableaux and parlour games in order to take centre stage, and as an excuse to dress even more flamboyantly. Her English companions consider her obsession with fashionable clothes the product of her French blood. Clothes, though, for Sharp, are an essential tool; they enable her to blend in with her upper-class associates. Sharp's \\"desire for fashion and worldliness\\" is in tune with the snobbish affectations‚Äîwhich she emulates‚Äîand hypocrisies of English society, which she identifies immediately. She is, however, sufficiently socially adaptable as to be able to blend in with the Bohemians she later meets in Germany.  Career  Daguerreotype photograph of William Makepeace Thackeray, author of Vanity Fair by Jesse Harrison Whitehurst. Educated at Miss Pinkerton's Academy, Sharp was an orphan. With no parents to guide her, either towards a good marriage or a career, she set out on her own to take what she could get from life. Her opening scene has her leaving the academy in a coach and throwing her copy of Johnson's Dictionary ‚Äî given her by Miss Pinkerton ‚Äî out of the window as she goes. As a penniless young lady of marriageable age alone in the world, hers is a traditional Burneyean entrance to the adult world. She starts on her career with the degenerate English gentry, and moves in with Sir Pitt Crawley as governess to his daughters. Sharp is dissatisfied, seeing herself as capable of far greater things: \\"in her imagination ... the princess de jure is only the governess de facto\\". She ends up in a more equal relationship with Crawley, who was described by Roger B. Henkle as \\"rascally, wenching, brawling ... drinks to all hours with Horrocks the Butler and smells of the stables\\". She makes herself indispensable to the soon-to-be-widowed Sir Pitt as his amanuensis, by doing his accounts and other paperwork. Partly due to this reliance on her, he proposes marriage after his second wife dies. She soon, however, realises the limitations of Crawley's position, and moves out when invited to London by Crawley's rich half-sister. She successfully insinuates herself into the British ruling class with almost nobody noticing. When she first meets Mr Sedley, she tells him her story, of her penniless orphanhood and he gives her gifts; the only character who ever sees through her now well-to-do English facade is Dobbin, who says to himself, \\"what a humbug that woman is!\\" Sharp's debut is at the Duchess of Richmond's ball, held on 15 June 1815 in Brussels, which celebrates the Duke of Wellington's army on the eve of the Battle of Quatre Bras against the exiled Napoleon who has returned to France and raised an army. However, she had no means of transport to the ball, and eventually only manages to travel by simpering to the owner of the only carriage available and flattering him over \\"the courage he does not possess\\". The ball is a perfect opportunity for Sharp to dress up in her finest, offset against the glamour of a military campaign and the presence of an entire officer corp. Compared to Amelia Sedley ‚Äî whose own appearance there is described as being an abject failure ‚Äî Sharp's \\"debut was, on the contrary, very brilliant. She arrived very late. Her face was radiant; her dress perfection\\". In Brussels, everyone is panicking due to the proximity of Napoleon's army and the unexpected arrival of the French King, Louis XVIII of France into Brussels exile, yet Sharp's main interest is in humiliating Amelia at the ball over her ‚Äî in Sharp's eyes ‚Äî poor quality gown. left Soon after, Jos wants to propose to Sharp, but he loses his nerve and subsequently disappears ‚Äî escaping back to Calcutta ‚Äî and by the time he eventually does propose, comments Knoepflmacher, \\"both Becky Sharp and our attitude toward her have moved on\\". Meanwhile, for Sharp, \\"he has become her last straw, not her first\\". Rawdon and Sharp have wed and have a son, also named Rawdon, but his role in her life is more in the manner of being a prop for Sharp to demonstrate her marital bliss. She makes her sitting room a salon ‚Äî with \\"ice and coffee ... the best there is in London ‚Äî where she can be surrounded by admirers, among whom she ranks men of a \\"small but elite crowd\\". It is no surprise, suggests Frazee, that Sharp eventually meets the King ‚Äî who had been regent, now George IV‚Äîand in his \\"high presence Mrs Rawdon passed her examination, and as it were, took her degree in reputation\\" from him: the King, suggests Thackeray, had created the very conditions which allowed Sharp to flourish. Sharp's marriage to Rawdon Crawley is a major step up the social ladder, although, comments Bloom, this \\"ladder was a magic one and could withdraw itself at will\\". When her husband is arrested and held for a ¬£100 debt, she writes to him from bed, insisting that she is doing everything in her power to release her \\"pauvre prisonnier\\". When he finally returns, finding her with Lord Steyne, he complains that she has not left him even ¬£100 to take with him. Sharp was not sleeping with Steyne; rather, she reckoned that she needed what she calls a \\"moral sheepdog\\", and that that was to be Steyne. Rawdon was mistaken: she was further ingratiating herself with Steyne as a stepping-stone to reaching the pinnacle of English society. Sharp finishes her days self-styling herself the Lady Crawley, a demi-mondaine living in penury in Curzon Street. Lisa Jadwin has described the book as ending \\"on a note of malignant irresolution\\". Sharp's fate is, to some degree ambiguous, and it is possible that Thackeray pastiches the classic Victorian novel's denouement in which the heroine makes a \\"death-in-life renunciation of worldly pleasures\\"‚Äîor the guise of one. Ulrich Knoepflmacher summarised Becky's experience: =Love life= Amelia Sedley's husband, George Osborne, wants to seduce Sharp: he too fails to see through Sharp's projected image, \\"blinded by Becky's constructed self\\". Sharp has sexual adventures, but Thackeray never makes the connection between Sharp's sexual relationships and rise in social status explicit. For Becky Sharp, sexuality and femininity are primarily tools with which to improve her social and financial position in both the short- and long-term. She is unmotivated, says Claudia Nelson, \\"by either heart or libido\\". Sharp herself comments, early in the book that \\"she never had been a girl ... she had been a woman since she was eight years old.\\" Any capacity for love she does possess is narcissistic, and similarly, she puts her financial and social advancement before motherhood. Reception =Critical= Early edition of Vanity Fair, c. 1850s Mid-Victorian literature was still somewhat orientated towards \\"young ladies literature\\" where the readership was morally sensitive. Thackeray took a degree of risk in presenting a character such as Sharp, says Michael Schmidt, but he remained within boundaries, and whilst he was satirical, he broke no taboos. Sharp, then, was a new phenomenon in Victorian fiction, which until Vanity Fair knew only of insipid heroines bound by convention or Smollett-esque grotesques. Amelia herself was one of the former, but Sharp was an original creation. Sharp has been called a \\"love to hate her and hate to love her\\" character, and this was radically different from previous representations of young women in literature. Thackeray has been described as \\"radical\\" in making his heroine(s) not only female, but also one of them conventionally wicked in character yet sympathetic to the audience. Sharp's way of intruding her life into that of others has led to comparisons by one scholar to other Victorian literary characters. Both Joseph Conrad's Mr Vladmir in The Secret Agent, and in a comic rather than serious setting, Trollope's Mr Slope in Barchester Towers, play similar roles. In a modern sense what made her dangerous to contemporary eyes was her ambition; women did not, in nineteenth-century England, climb the social ladder‚Äîat least, not in an obvious manner. That Sharp survives, and at times, thrives, despite her moral ambiguity indicates that Thackeray believed society was no longer able to cure wrongdoing. Sharp was, according to Hughes, \\"a measure of how debased society had come\\". Sharp's machinations can only work within the world of Vanity Fair ‚Äî and Victorian society more broadly ‚Äî because vanity and artificiality make it susceptible to her. Another plot device favoured by Victorian writers was that of children playing adult roles in society, and vice versa, and Sharp's comment that she had not been a girl since she was eight years' old has led to her being identified as one such \\"child-woman\\". Vanity Fair was the first major novel to have a governess, whether a heroine or an anti-heroine, as its main character. They had always been in the background, but Sharp was the first time a governess' ambitions to break out of her limited society were placed centre stage. Sharp's orphan status reflected a common theme in writers of the period; as Kathryn Hughes notes, for Emily Morton from Amy Herbert, Charlotte Bront√´'s eponymous character from Jane Eyre, and Jane Fairfax from Emma, their positions as orphans are central to the books' subsequent plots. Similarly central are their roles as governesses, but whereas for Emily and the two Janes it symbolised class distinctions and the gap between the governess and her employers, for Sharp it was a means of role reversal. Unlike Jane Eyre, Sharp is aware of the ways of the world from a very young age. Henkle suggests that Sharp, with her carefree and radical approach to social barriers, is symbolic of the change that Victorian society was undergoing in the mid-19th century. There was greater fluidity than ever before as a result of the massively increased wealth among the middle class as a result of the Industrial Revolution, and this fluidity allowed the courtesan to flourish in the Regency era. Thackeray's illustration of Becky as left The events portrayed in Vanity Fair are described by narration, but the narrator is uninterested in Sharp's thoughts, only her actions. For example, when she goes to bed wondering whether Jos will call on her the next morning, the very next sentence informs us that he did. What Sharp thought, in the meantime, is deemed irrelevant to the reader's enjoyment and understanding of the novel. However, although the Narrator repeatedly draws attention to Sharp's immoralities, he does recognise that her behaviour reflects the hypocrisy of the world ‚Äî \\"that has, perhaps, no particular objection to vice, but an insuperable repugnance to hearing vice called by its proper name\\". Writes Montz, \\"Becky Sharp is artificial because she chooses to be so: the reader never sees any sign that there is a real Becky beneath the facade of the performer, the flirtatious lover, the good wife, the social climber, the capricious friend\\". Such women as Sharp, writes Frazee, contributed \\"nearly as much to the pungent flavour of the period as did the regent himself\\". Margaret Atwood has praised Sharp as a character, writing how she \\"makes no pretensions to goodness. She is wicked, she enjoys being wicked, and she does it out of vanity and her own profit, tricking and deluding English society in the process\\". She compares Sharp to Edith Wharton's Undine Spragg in The Custom of the Country: both live on their wits \\"and use men as ambulatory bank accounts\\", although the latter did not have the spirit or sense of humour that Sharp is portrayed with. More personally, suggests Henkle, to Thackeray himself she represented the power of the artist and the writer, in how she overcomes obstacles to achieve her aims. Her entire career, says F. M. Salter, is \\"one supreme irony\\", and Patricia Marks suggests that Becky, although a rounded character, remains \\"nothing without her finery\\", and compared with her, the other characters appear \\"tattered\\". Commentator Heather L. Braun describes Becky at the end of the novel as akin to a Rhine maiden, a Clytemnestra: \\"she has become 'an apparition' that 'glides' rather than walks into a room; her hair 'floats' around her pale face, framing a 'ghastly expression' that elicits fear and trembling in those who look upon her\\". Braun compares Becky's wanderings around Europe to the toils of Circe. = Popular = Thackeray personally disapproved of Sharp's behaviour, and contemporaries would have understood how, from Sharp's actions, she was a bad woman. However, their judgement would be based as much on actual expectations of real social morality as on what they read in Thackeray's pages. More, that they thought she was bad need not have meant they were necessarily unsympathetic. Thackeray himself compared Sharp's career as \\"resembling the slitherings of a mermaid\\", and Bloom says that she is enough of a character to make her fundamentally likeable, to the extent that \\"any reader who does not like Becky is almost certainly not very likeable herself or himself\\". Poet Dorothy Parker‚Äîherself orphaned at age nine‚Äî\\"strongly identified\\" with Sharp, and effectively treated her as a role model. Meade, in her biography of Parker, says Sharp became Parker's alter ego, and that it was from her that Parker learnt \\"the rules of the game\\". To Eva M. Dadlez, Sharp is a character to be admired, particularly for her intelligence ‚Äî which is more acute than any of the other characters (aside from Dobbin, who sees through her) ‚Äî her overcoming a difficult childhood, and ultimately \\"her talent to survive disasters\\". She notes that Sharp looks better when the general unprincipled foolishness of the rest of the cast is taken into account. Thackeray's character made a strong impression on contemporaries. Elizabeth Browning's protagonist of Aurora Leigh (1856), Marian Erle, is a similar character to Sharp. In 1872 The Spectator reviewed Anthony Trollope's The Eustace Diamonds and made an unfavourable comparison between Trollope's main female lead, Lady Eustace, and Becky Sharp. The reviewer wrote how \\"we had supposed that in Lady Eustace we were to have Mr Trollope's equivalent for Thackeray's Becky Sharp, but we hardly think that we have got it; or if we have, Mr Trollope's equivalent for Thackeray's Becky Sharp is but a poor one.\\" Henry James called Sharp an \\"epic governess\\" of literature. In 1848, writing in The Spectator, R. S. Rintoul wrote In the 21st century, Sharp's character has been used in diverse ways. For example, it has been the subject of a book on business ethics, and a work of fiction by Sarra Manning transposes her life and adventures onto a contemporary woman.  Real- life models  Oscar Wilde said that he asked a female friend of Thackeray's whether Sharp had any real-life basis. She said that although the character was strictly fictional, her general character had been suggested to Thackeray by a governess in Kensington Square, who was a lady's companion to a wealthy but irascible elderly woman. In an unpublished 1911 essay, novelist Charles Reade used the accepted image of Sharp to illustrate Madame du Barry's assertion that the most foolish woman can trick a man, by using against him the education that he has paid for. Says Reade, had she known of Thackeray's creation, du Barry would have asserted \\"the wisest of the sex is a Becky Sharp\\". It has in turn been suggested that du Barry was a direct model for Thackeray's Sharp, with both women being \\"careless beauties cursed with ambition beyond reason, who venture into activities beyond morals\\". Another possible model for Sharp from the same era suggested Andrew Lang, may be Jeanne de Valois, notorious for her involvement in the affair of the Diamond Necklace. Like de Valois, Sharp had a childhood of financial hardship, and Sharp's later boast of how she was related to the French noble family of de Montmorency could have been based on de Valois' own claims to have French royal blood in her veins. Gordon Ray suggested that the character of Sharp had no single source; rather, it was the combination of aspects of different women that Thackeray had observed and read about. Other possible models for the Sharp character have been suggested as Mary Anne Clarke and Harriette Wilson, two of the most well known English courtesans of the Regency era. Clarke was originally Mistress of the Regent's brother, the Duke of York, and in 1809 had been at the centre of a scandal in which she acknowledged selling officers' commissions with the duke's knowledge, who‚Äîbeing Commander-in- chief‚Äîsubsequently resigned. Clarke attempted to publish her memoirs on the matter; they were suppressed, but she received a ¬£10,000 payment and an annuity from the King. Harriette Wilson‚Äîdescribed by Walter Scott as having \\"lived with half the gay world at hack and manger\\"‚Äîalso published her memoirs. She too had profited from her liaisons with important society men, and had become mistress to the Earl of Craven at the age of 15; her memoirs went through over 30 editions in their year of publication. Says Frazee, \\"these two most celebrated courtesans of the Regency provided Thackeray with material which, when added to that he acquired from first-hand knowledge of women like Becky and from his reading of fiction\\" enabled him to create a realistic Regency courtesan in Sharp.  Dramatic portrayals  Gertrude Coghlan as Becky Sharp, 1900 In 1899, Langdon Mitchell's production of Vanity Fair toured the United States with Minnie Maddern Fiske as Sharp, a role Fiske received critical praise for. The following year his production was plagiarised by Gertrude Coghlan's Delcher & Hennessy theatre company, with herself in the lead role, until Mitchell sued. The first film version of Vanity Fair was released in 1915. This was a silent movie directed by Charles Brabin and also starring Fiske in the main role. Another silent version, directed by Walter Courtney Rowden and starring Kyrie Bellew, was made and released in Britain seven years later. The following year saw another silent production released by Samuel Goldwyn; this was directed by Hugo Ballin and starred his wife, Mabel, as Sharp. The film is now considered lost. The first spoken-word release was Chester M. Franklin's 1932 film of Vanity Fair, with Sharp played by Myrna Loy; her marriage scene was filmed in Boston's Louisburg Square, representing Russell Square in London. Three years later Miriam Hopkins played Sharp in Rouben Mamoulian's production, which was the first feature film to use three-strip Technicolor. Hopkins was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal. Reese Witherspoon played Sharp in Mira Nair's 2004 film based on the novel; Rotten Tomatoes criticized the film's version of the character, writing \\"A more likable Becky Sharp makes for a less interesting movie.\\" Vanity Fair has also been produced numerous times for television. The first, for the BBC in 1967, starred Susan Hampshire. This was followed twenty years later, also by the BBC at the Pebble Mill studios, with Eve Matheson as Sharp. Andrew Davies wrote the screenplay of a BBC television drama of Vanity Fair which was screened in 1998; Natasha Little played Becky Sharp. Little won the Best Actress in a Drama Series category in the following year's Biarritz International Television Festival as well as a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her portrayal of Sharp. Olivia Cooke played Sharp in a 2018 television series, screened on ITV over seven episodes.

It runs from Route 16 in Milford east to the VFW Parkway in Boston. Most of Route 109 runs along a portion of the Hartford and Dedham Turnpike. Route description Medway Route 109 begins at Route 16 in Milford, just east of Route 85's southern terminus. The route proceeds to the east, meeting Interstate 495 at Exit 19 before crossing into Norfolk County and the town of Medway. Route 109 passes through northern Medway, crossing Route 126 along the way before turning onto Main Street. The highway continues into Millis, where it crosses Route 115 in the center of town. The road then crosses the Charles River as it enters Medfield, passing through the center of town where it intersects Route 27. East of Medfield, Route 109 travels along the Dover - Walpole town line before entering Westwood. The highway passes through the town, easing towards the urban landscape of metro Boston. North of the center of town, Route 109 interchanges with Interstate 95 (Route 128) at Exit 16 as it enters Dedham. Route 109 passes through northwest Dedham, crossing the Charles twice more before crossing into the Boston neighborhood of West Roxbury, where it immediately meets the VFW Parkway and ends. The VFW Parkway, which has its southern terminus at the intersection with Route 109, formerly carried U.S. Route 1 into the city, before US-1 was rerouted along I-95 and I-93 through Braintree and downtown Boston, due to the cancellation of I-95 in Boston during the 1970s. As such, Route 109 no longer ends at a numbered highway, although the Boston-Providence Turnpike runs south from this intersection to join the current US-1 at its interchange with I-95/Route 128. South of the interchange, US-1 runs along the Turnpike. History The Hartford and Dedham Turnpike was chartered on March 9, 1804 to close a gap in the turnpikes that were being built to replace the Middle Post Road between Dedham and Hartford. It ran from Dedham southwest to West Medway, where it continued as the earlier Ninth Massachusetts Turnpike and Boston Turnpike to Hartford, Connecticut. North of Dedham, the Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike continued to Boston. The turnpike, built in 1807, was never a success. In 1821 it was closed to all but local travel due to its condition; it became a free road in 1830, with the rest of the route to Hartford becoming free in 1838. The path of the road is now mostly covered by Route 109. The turnpike entered Dedham center using High Street, and in Westwood, Dover and Medfield the old turnpike exists as Hartford Street, while Route 109 uses the older alignment with better grades. Near the west end, Route 109 turns west towards Milford, and the turnpike continues southwest on Main Street to end at its merge with Route 126 and the Middle Post Road. The original Route 109 went from US 7 in Pittsfield to US 20 in West Brookfield along what is now Route 9. This western section of Route 109 was decommissioned in 1933, during the flooding of the Quabbin Reservoir, as it had run though the center of Enfield, Massachusetts, a town itself disincorporated in late April 1938 due to the flooding of the Quabbin Reservoir.Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Public Works. 1933 Road Map and Detour Bulletin.

In the last 10,000 years they have gone on with a sort of > decadent kicked-in-the-head civilization that contains automobiles, business > suits, fedora hats, telephones, spaceships ‚Äî a civilization which looks > almost an exact duplicate but is worse off than the current US > civilization.Hubbard, SHSBC 291, Auditing Comm Cycles, August 6, > 1963Hubbard, Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary, 1st edition, > pg. 243. The capital of the Confederacy is said to be \\"one of the tail stars of the Big Dipper\\", probably Alkaid, a star 108 light years distant from Earth. The Marcabians used to rule Earth at some point in the past but lost control of it due to \\"losses in war and other things\\".  Marcabians  The Marcabians had an oppressive political system: \\"if [a person] was considered to be in contempt of court or anything like that, [he was] simply fried since there was a curtain of radioactive material which went clear across the front of the bench anywhere that a witness or anybody would stand, and so on.\\"Hubbard, History and development of processes: question and answer period, December 17, 1954 The Big Dipper constellation, where Hubbard said the Marcab Confederacy are still headquartered today. Hubbard said that the Marcab Confederacy invented income tax as a means of punishment, with the death penalty imposed for making even the slightest mistake in returns ‚Äî \\"one comma wrong and it's 'dead forever'.\\" The Marcabians also appear to have been distinctly socialistic, having \\"had plan balanced economies\\" (presumably some form of planned economy).Hubbard, SHSBC 12, E-Meter Actions, Errors in Auditing, June 12, 1961 They were also keen on motor racing and every once in a while Scientologists undergoing auditing \\"will run into [memories of] race tracks and race-track drivers\\". Hubbard described this in some detail in a 1960 lecture: > They had turbine-generated cars that went about 275 miles an hour (443 > km/h). They ran with a high whine. I notice they've just now invented the > motor again. And they had tracks that were booby-trapped with atom bombs, > and they had side bypasses. The tracks were mined, and the grandstands were > leaded-paned.Hubbard, HCOB Create and Confront, January 3, 1960 The tracks were deliberately designed to be as dangerous as possible, with \\"a mountain that you went up to the top of and fell off\\", and death was commonplace; but participants in the races, and any other citizen, might be revived by the civilization's medical ability. According to author Russell Miller, Hubbard liked to reminisce to his followers about \\"how he was a race- car driver in the Marcab civilization\\". One of the people who accompanied him aboard his private fleet in the late 1960s described Hubbard's stories of life with the Marcabians: > LRH said he was a race driver called the Green Dragon who set a speed record > before he was killed in an accident. He came back in another lifetime as the > Red Devil and beat his own record, then came back and did it again as the > Blue Streak. Finally he realized all he was doing was breaking his own > records and it was no game any more. Hubbard describes this in his lecture Create and Confront, describing multiple lives as a Marcabian racing driver, with color-themed names including 'The Green Rocket', 'The Red Comet', 'The Silver Streak', 'The Gold Bomb', et al. Hubbard stated that the Marcab Confederacy was now using Earth as a \\"prison planet\\". When a person dies or \\"drops the body\\", his thetan is pulled into a Marcab-established \\"implant station\\" or \\"report station\\", where they are subject to brainwashing and reincarnation. Only Scientologists who reach the status of \\"Operating Thetan\\" are said to avoid this fate. > The report area for most has been Mars. Some women report to stations > elsewhere in the Solar System. There are occasional incidents about Earth > report stations. The report stations are protected by screens. The last > report station on Earth was established in the Pyrenees.Hubbard, > Scientology: A History of Man, 1st edition, 1952.  Described in secondary works  * Russell Miller described Hubbard's ideas regarding the Marcab Confederacy, in his critical book on the man, entitled: Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard. * The Washington Post cited \\"an invasion fleet deployed from the Marcab Confederacy\\", in a report on John Travolta. * A 2006 article in Rolling Stone called \\"Inside Scientology\\", described the Marcab Confederacy as an \\"invader force\\". Rolling Stone said that it was explained as a vast galactic civilization over 200,000 years old, but appears as a duplicate of the United States civilization. * An alleged OT VIII document, part of the Fishman Affidavit, describes a mass Marcab invasion of Earth as coinciding with the appearance of the Anti-Christ. The Church denied the authenticity of this document,http://kspaink.home.xs4all.nl/fishman/kobrin-f.txt and it does not appear in the Operating Thetan documents leaked in March 2008, though the Church claim it as copyrighted material. * Based on this, internet group Anonymous has been creating Marcab-based art as part of its Project Chanology activism. For instance the Germany-based Marcab e.V..News release in German http://vlad.code-1.de/marcab_pressemitteilung.pdf * An alien race, the Markab exists in the fictional Babylon 5 universe. Although the name is based on the same star name (Markab) and the government of that species is the Markab Confederacy, the creator of Babylon 5 J. Michael Straczynski has explicitly denied any Scientology connection. * The Marcab Confederacy appear as the titular antagonists of \\"The Sun Stealers\\", the first story of the Alien Worlds radio drama. Straczynski also worked as a co-writer on this series. * There is a race of aliens known as the Marcabians featured in \\"The Secret of Easter Island\\", an original story created for the 1997 Blake and Mortimer cartoon show.

Of the cities of Sicily bearing the name \\"Hybla\\", it is much the least known from ancient sources. No allusion to it is found in Pausanias, where he is distinguishing Hybla Major from Hybla Minor, nor in any of the geographers: but we find in the Itineraries a town of Hybla, placed on the line of road from Syracuse to Agrigentum (modern Agrigento, which is certainly distinct from both Hybla Major and Minor (and from Megara Hyblaea and Hybla Gereatis which may equate with them), and can therefore be no other than the third Hybla of Stephanus.

It was the only programme on the radio station where the hosts are allowed to play music of their own choice, thus giving airplay to music that aren't in the charts and music from upcoming artists. However the peculiar satire that dominated the show was really what distinguished it from other more common radio shows. The hosts didn't comply with normal radio-behaviour and would often talk at the same time for example, giving the programme a very impromptu atmosphere. In many of the episodes members of the programme's own crew, the producer Gry Frid Nielsen, Karsten \\"the Philosopher\\" Holt and various trainees on the radio station, as well as random people they call on air often played an active part in the programme. As a fairly recurring event \\"guest DJ\\" Kjeld Tolstrup (aka. Kapel-Kjeld) visited the studio each Friday and composed the playlist and joined in dialogue between the hosts. In the end of the show a contest was held called Tillidsbingo (roughly translated: Trust Bingo). Rules were that the listeners made their own bingo cards (preferably of minced meat or some other unusual material) with 15 numbers from 1 to 90 and when they thought they had \\"bingo\\" they would call in. When the listeners got through they had to shout \\"Tillidsbingo\\" as the first thing they say. If this was achieved all the listener now had to do was to go through some banter with hosts and then s/he had won a T-shirt specially designed by the hosts. The listeners' winning numbers were not checked, thus the name Trust Bingo. Ever since he first came through in Tillidsbingo in 2007, the then agricultural student (now studying on a mercantile high school) Kasper, who is from a rural part of Denmark called Thy, has been a regular friend of the show. The hosts used to call him every Friday to catch up on how his week had been. Another recurring theme throughout the show was the reading aloud of apparently sober texts, such as household tips and reader contributions from weekly \\"age +40\\" magazines and children's books, but implying a great deal of sexual innuendo. Promotion of upcoming artists The show acquired a reputation of boosting young underground artists careers (in Denmark at least). The then completely unknown French singer Soko's song I'll Kill Her was discovered by guest DJ Kjeld Tolstrup when surfing on the website MySpace and became an instant smash hit in Denmark after being played in the show. The song quickly reached number one on the Danish version of the iTunes Store and was the number one song in rotation on radio. Late she played a live mini-session in the show and gave a sold-out concert in Denmark, despite not even having put out an entire album. The same can be said about the just as unknown Israeli/South African singer- songwriter Yoav, who equally soon gave a \\"The Black Boy Scouts mini-session\\" and a sold-out concert in Lille Vega. Popularity The show was once a late- night radio show only broadcast once a week, but as their popularity grew their spot was first moved to 10‚Äì12 am every Sunday and then again to 2‚Äì4 pm every weekday. Their new airtime caused the ratings to skyrocket, reaching about 400,000 listeners every day. Their podcast has also had 100,000 monthly downloads, making it the number one on the Danish iTunes's \\"Most Downloaded Podcasts\\" list when the show was still aired. Awards *2007 and 2008: The Golden Microphone. The readers of Ekstra Bladet voted the show's hosts as the best radio hosts on Danish radio. *2008: Zulu Award for best Danish radio programme.

Licensed to Owosso, Michigan, it first began broadcasting in 1965 under the WOAP-FM call sign. Its transmitter is located east of Owosso, while its studios are located in Flint Township. History The original WOAP-FM began broadcasting in April 1948 at 103.1 on the FM dial. Although the station's owner, The Owosso Argus-Press, which also owned AM station WOAP 1080 AM, heavily promoted its new FM station, WOAP-FM was a failure and went off the air by 1953. WOAP-FM resurfaced on its current 103.9 frequency on December 2, 1965. It served as a simulcast of the full-service/MOR AM station and continued the AM's programming after AM sign-off as well as broadcasting local high-school sports. Eventually WOAP-AM and WOAP-FM separated programming completely, with the FM station taking a beautiful music format. In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission's concerns about concentration of media ownership in the Owosso area at that time forced the Argus-Press to sell WOAP- AM-FM. In 1989, WOAP-FM changed its call letters to WMZX and its format to adult contemporary. In the late 1990s, the station began targeting the Flint market more aggressively. In 1998, 103.9 FM switched from classic hits as WAHV \\"The Wave\\" to soft AC as WRSR \\"Soft Rock 103.9.\\" WRSR originally carried the syndicated Delilah love-songs show at night, but later switched to a simulcast of Detroit station WNIC-FM's \\"Pillow Talk\\" show hosted by Alan Almond after crosstown rival WCRZ dropped its own local love-songs show in favor of Delilah. Following the failure of the AC format, WRSR switched to its current format on September 14, 2000 at noon. ''' In September 2011, WRSR owner Cumulus received permission to acquire Citadel Broadcasting on the condition that they spin off three radio stations including WRSR. WRSR was operated by Potential Broadcasting trust until the station was sold. The local Citadel stations Cumulus acquired are WFBE and WTRX. Potential moved the WRSR studios and offices from the Cumulus Flint cluster's base of operations in the Flint Radio Center on Taylor Drive in Mundy Township to the old WFBE location on Miller Road in Flint Township. Cumulus moved WFBE and WTRX from Miller Road to Taylor Drive. On August 28, 2012 the station was sold to Rod Krol of Krol Communications who also owns WJSZ in Ashley and WMLM in St. Louis. Plans are for the new owner to take over in the fourth quarter of 2012 and he is satisfied with its current makeup.Krol Communications purchases Flint, Owosso classic rock radio station WRSR 103.9 The Fox The Flint Journal via MLive.com, August 28, 2012 The sale of WRSR to Krol was consummated on December 1, 2012, at a purchase price of $1.15 million. In March 2016, Jeremy Fenech was brought on as Program Director and afternoon host, and one of the first things he did was unplug the satellites ensuring 100% local programming and content, with no syndication. In addition to the changes in the programming department, Krol Communications Inc also invested in equipment and technology for the studio and the broadcast chain which has improved the quality of the signal dramatically. Since then, the station has continually and consistently enjoyed ratings success. WRSR became the home of local radio celebrity Johnny Burke in March 2017. Burke most recently hosted the morning show at WHNN in Bay City prior to an abrupt format change which left him jobless. WHNN's format change left WRSR the only station in the Flint market playing hits from the 1960s through 1980s. Joining Burke is former WHNN news director Hal Maas, who will do news updates for both WRSR and WJSZ. Burke's new show runs from 5am to 10am weekday mornings.

This small and almost intact temple was one of the first discoveries during the excavation of Pompeii in 1764.Hackworth Petersen, L. (2006). The Freedman in Roman Art and Art History. Cambridge University Press Its role as a Hellenized Egyptian temple in a Roman colony was fully confirmed with an inscription detailed by Francisco la Vega on July 20, 1765. Original paintings and sculptures can be seen at the Museo Archaeologico in Naples; the site itself remains on the Via del Tempio di Iside. In the aftermath of the temple's discovery many well-known artists and illustrators swarmed to the site.Nappo, p. 91. The preserved Pompeian temple is actually the second structure; the original building built during the reign of Augustus was damaged in an earlier earthquake, in 62 AD. At the time of the 79 AD eruption of Vesuvius, the Iseum was the only temple to have been completely re-built; even the Capitolium had not been. Although the Iseum was wedged into a small and narrow space, it received significant foot traffic from theater-goers at the Large Theater, businessmen in the Triangular Forum, and others along the Stabian Gate. Principal devotees of this temple are assumed to be women, freedmen, and slaves. Initiates of the Isis mystery cultAntonio Virgili, Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Gangemi, Roma, 2008 worshipped a compassionate goddess who promised eventual salvation and a perpetual relationship throughout life and after death.The Diaspora Cults. (1970) Ancient History XI, High Empire 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press. The temple itself was reconstructed in honor of a 6-year-old boy named Numerius Popidius Celsinus by his freedman father, Numerius Popidius Ampliatus, and his mother Corelia Celsa, to allow the child to enter elite society. Many scenes from the temple are re-created in the dining rooms of Pompeians, however, indicating that many individuals visited this temple for political, economic, or social reasons. Greco-Roman depiction of Isis  Isis in Pompeii  The cult of Isis is thought to have arrived in Pompeii around 100 BCE; the existing temple was built following the destruction of its predescessor in the earthquake of 62 CE.Nappo, p. 89. Though Isis' origins were in Ancient Egypt, her cult spread widely throughout the Greco-Roman world. The Greeks and Romans always had admiration for Egyptian culture, and before Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, there was a cultural fusion between Greeks and Egyptians. After Alexander's defeat of Egypt in the fourth century, the Greeks started to incorporate Isis into their pantheon of deities. Isis was easily accepted into Greek religion because of her many similarities to the Greek goddess, Demeter. Eventually, she became the patron goddess of the sea, as a protector of people traveling by sea. One of her major temples was on the island of Philae. In Rome, Isis was introduced as a replacement deity for Venus, after the death of Caesar, and was looked to for guidance. Among the Greeks and Romans, she was known as Isis because the Egyptian word for ‚Äúthrone‚Äù translates to ‚ÄúIsis‚Äù in Greek. Isis is most associated with fertility and motherhood, and was looked to as the ideal image of a queen, wife, and mother but is also known for powers in healing and magic. Because she was a fertility deity, she was looked up to by women. She was the friend of slaves, sinners, artisans, and the downtrodden, who also listened to the prayers of the wealthy, maidens, aristocrats and rulers.R.E Witt, \\"Isis in the Ancient World\\", p. 7, 1997, . Devotion to Isis was also intimately coupled with the acquisition of knowledge, considered an endowment of the gods. There are a couple of Hellenistic versions of Isis: one depicts her as holding a musical instrument in her right hand, and a water pitcher in the other. The other models her similarly to Demeter, in which she holds corn in her right hand, rather than the instrument. Her left hand is placed at her waist.  Architecture  Temple of Isis, Pompeii The Temple of Isis sits on a platform which is elevated off the ground, and entered in by way of stairs. The temple is designed based on a north-east and south-west plan. It features a vaulted roof, drawing attention to the top of the building. This style of roofing was a Roman stylistic influence, yet was becoming phased out by the time the temple was built. Weber, who excavated the temple, speculated that the Temple of Isis was built according to the Corinthian order. The Temple of Isis had two sections: an outer space surrounded by columns, called the pronaos; and the inner area - naos - which housed the statues of Isis and Osiris. Both areas of the temple were entered and exited through ornate niches. The architecture of the Temple of Isis is a fusion of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian features, incorporating Egyptian statues in the design. The mixture of Eastern stylistic influences with Hellenistic paid tribute to Isis' Egyptian roots, while still keeping the imagery domestic. In comparison to authentic Egyptian temples, the Temple of Isis was very much in line with the Roman architectural style. Egyptian features of this temple include: purgatorium, a roofless enclosure in the southeast corner of the courtyard that demarcates a subterranean room with a basin for Nile waters. The water from the Nile functioned as holy water used for rituals. The structure itself resembles a miniature temple with pediments and pilasters at the entrance coated with stucco.Hackworth Petersen, L. (2006). The Freedman in Roman Art and Art History. Cambridge University Press Structurally, it is built with columns all around; twenty-nine total. Though it is not a large structure, both the interior and exterior of the monument are elaborately decorated. Inside the inner chapel was a holding space for a statue of Isis. Further into the temple are altars and recesses in the walls; outside of the temple was a crypt used for initiating members into the cult. It also features a large room - called an Ekklesiasterion - at the back of the sanctuary, which functioned as a gathering area for the members of the cult to participate in rituals. Next to the Ekklesiasterion was the sacrarium, which stored the temple's prized objects. Furthermore, statues of Isis are assumed to line the front of the temple with Roman deities along the long walls. The Temple of Isis was a significant aspect of life in Rome. It was in a central location near the Forum, theaters, wrestling school, and temples honoring gods, Asclepius and Neptune. Upon analysis of the remains of the temple, it is known that it was painted with a red and white color scheme throughout. The white paint was meant to emulate a stone-like appearance. Io and Isis depicted on the southern wall of the Ekklesiasterion  Temple Art & Iconography  353x353pxDepictions of Isis in her temple are done in Hellenistic tradition, which means that Isis is depicted as being Roman, rather than Egyptian. This was likely done in an effort to assimilate her into Roman culture. However, art in the Egyptian style were still integrated into the temple. Walls in the temple were all beautifully painted. The frescoes in the Temple of Isis are thought to have been done in the First and Second Style of Pompeian painting, as was the artistic trend at the time. Wall paintings in this style possessed a lot of color, complex, and were representational and influenced by theater. However, when the temple was restored after the earthquake in 62 C.E., the paintings became done in the Fourth Style, which was illusionistic, eclectic, and was a combination of all Pompeian painting styles. After the restoration, the frescoes of Io were patronized by affluent Romans. In addition to the monochromatic floor mosaic, the walls of the Ekklesiasterion illustrated various mythological scenes. The Ekklesiasterion includes scenes of Io's arrival in Egypt and subsequent reception by Isis. In this fresco, Isis is depicted having a serpent around her wrist, and a crocodile at her feet. The north wall includes scenes with Io (mythology), Argos, and Hermes. This room itself appears to be the most formal with its role in ritual banquets as well as the reunion of initiates. The sacrarium is also heavily Egyptian influenced with a mural of snakes guarding a wicker basket adorned with lunar symbols. This may represent a spring sailing season celebration, navigium Isidis, since Isis restores her husband-brother to life by towing a boat filled with sacred waters.  Excavation  The Temple of Isis sustained significant damage from the earthquake that affected Pompeii in the first century. When the temple was excavated in 1794 by Karl Jakob Weber, many remnants of temple life were found. Fragments of statues and ritual materials were found scattered in various parts of the temple. The excavation in this area began in 1709 with Duc d'Elbeuf's unearthing of artifacts through well-digging in the area later identified as Herculaneum. The earliest excavations of the Roman towns in Campania - destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. - are highlighted by the excavations between 1750 and 1764 and the work of Weber. He was a Swiss military engineer charged with the supervision of the excavations during the period by Roceque Joaquin de Alcubierre, chief director of the royal excavations from 1738 until his death in 1780. These early excavations faced many daunting tasks: the difficulties of excavating through tons of volcanic material in Resina to investigate Herculaneum, the problems of disturbing established and arable farmland to evacuate in Pompeii, and the resulting health hazards from long periods underground in damp conditions. During the extraction of this material, Weber's workers dug haphazardly around the site looking for valuable sculptural finds, back-filling immediately afterwards to prevent collapse. Although Weber, determined to produce accurate maps of the orientation of the villages and individual buildings, believed the newly discovered areas should be left exposed for public exhibition.  Influences on Artistic Culture  After its excavation, the Temple of Isis influenced the art world; it was the subject for many inspired artists. The famous composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is known to have visited the Temple of Isis at Pompeii in 1769, just a few years after it was unearthed and when Mozart was himself just 13 years old. His visit and the memories of the site are considered to have inspired him 20 years later in his composition of The Magic Flute.\\"The magic flute\\", Matheus Franciscus & Maria Berk, p450, BRILL, 2004, The temple also inspired the backgrounds for The Magic Flute opera adaptation.

Kansas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915), was a US Supreme Court case based on US labor law that allowed employers to implement contracts, called yellow-dog contracts, which forbade employees from joining unions. The case was decided in the era prior to the Great Depression, when the Supreme Court invalidated laws that imposed restrictions on contracts, especially those of employment. The liberty of contract became viewed as a fundamental right that could be abridged only in extreme circumstances. Abridgements violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Background Coppage, an employer, forbade his employees from joining labor unions by making it part of their contract, which the employee signed before being hired. That violated a Kansas law that prohibited such contracts. Decision The majority opinion was written by Justice Pitney. It held that the law prohibiting such contracts violated Coppage's due process rights, as the government did not have a responsibility to prevent inequality of bargaining power: He concluded that a state in the exercise of its police power did not have the right to redress imbalances of bargaining power and that requiring a man to give up the right to be in a union as a condition of employment does \\"not to ask him to give up any part of his constitutional freedom.\\" Dissents Justice Holmes wrote a dissent in which he called again for Lochner to be overruled and stated that the Constitution does not specifically prohibit a law like the one Kansas had and so it should be upheld: Justice Day's dissent would have affirmed the liberty of contract against arbitrary legislative restraints but deferred more to the legislature on the question of whether the law upheld the public welfare.

From San Ysidro, the segment of I-5 in California runs north across the length of the state, and crosses into Oregon south of the Medford-Ashland metropolitan area. It is the more important and most-used of the two major north‚Äìsouth routes on the Pacific Coast, the other being U.S. Route 101 (US 101), which is primarily coastal. This highway links the major California cities of San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, Stockton, Sacramento, and Redding. The San Francisco Bay area is about west of the highway. I-5 has several named portions: the Montgomery Freeway, San Diego Freeway, Santa Ana Freeway, Golden State Freeway, and West Side Freeway. Route description I-5 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The segment of I-5 from State Route 89 (SR 89) to US 97 forms part of the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway, an All-American Road. I-5 is also eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is a scenic highway as designated by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) only from State Route 152 (SR 152) to I-580. =San Diego County= Interstate 5 looking south toward downtown San Diego in January 2002 I-5 begins at the San Ysidro Port of Entry from Mexico in the San Ysidro neighborhood of San Diego. Immediately after the border, I-805 splits off to the northeast and serves as a bypass of I-5 that avoids the downtown San Diego area. I-5 itself continues northwest and meets the western end of SR 905, a route that connects with the Otay Mesa border crossing. I-5 then continues northward and joins the southern end of SR 75, a highway connecting to Coronado via the Silver Strand. I-5 then enters Chula Vista, briefly leaving the San Diego city limits. It continues along the east side of San Diego Bay where it intersects with SR 54 and enters National City. From there, I-5 veers around Naval Base San Diego and reenters the city limits of San Diego. I-5 subsequently intersects with four state routes: the southern end of SR 15 (the extension of I-15), SR 75 and the Coronado Bay Bridge, the western end of SR 94, and SR 163\\\\. In addition to serving Downtown San Diego, I-5 also provides access to Balboa Park from the Pershing Drive exit. The portion of I-5 from the Mexican border to downtown San Diego is named the Montgomery Freeway in honor of John J. Montgomery, a pioneer aviator who flew a glider from a location near Chula Vista in 1884. I-5 southbound in San Diego toward Mexico, September 2012 I-5 continues northwest from downtown as the San Diego Freeway until it reaches its junction with I-8, then turns slightly to the north while passing SeaWorld and Mission Bay. Thereafter, I-5 intersects the western end of SR 52 near La Jolla before entering University City. At Nobel Drive, the San Diego LDS Temple towers over I-5. Shortly afterward, I-5 passes through the UC San Diego campus and intersects the northern terminus of I-805 before continuing north and intersecting the western end of SR 56\\\\. At this interchange, there is a local bypass that provides the only access to Carmel Mountain Road from both directions and provides the only direct access to SR 56 going northbound. North of the San Diego city limits, I-5 enters the city limits of Solana Beach, and then three incorporated cities to the north: Encinitas, Carlsbad and Oceanside. This segment is currently undergoing expansion as part of the North Coast Corridor project. In Oceanside, I-5 intersects the SR 78 freeway and the SR 76 expressway and continues through Camp Pendleton. It then follows the Pacific Ocean coastline for the next . Toward the northern end of its routing through Camp Pendleton, I-5 passes through San Onofre State Beach and near the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. I-5 enters Orange County at the Cristianitos Road exit. =Orange County= Upon entering Orange County, I-5 goes through San Clemente. At Dana Point, I-5 turns inland while SR 1 continues along the coast. I-5 then heads due north through San Juan Capistrano and Mission Viejo, intersecting the SR 73 toll road heading northwest. I-5 continues to the El Toro Y interchange with I-405 in southeastern Irvine, splitting into lanes for regular traffic as well as for truck traffic (though autos can use these lanes as well). From that point, I-405 takes over the San Diego Freeway designation, while I-5 becomes the Santa Ana Freeway as it runs southeast to northwest. After the El Toro Y junction, I-5 intersects SR 133, a toll road that eventually connects to SR 241\\\\. Just before the Tustin city limits, I-5 passes over SR 261, the final toll road of the Eastern Transportation Corridor, but traffic must use Jamboree Road to access the latter. I-5 then intersects SR 55 and enters Santa Ana, the county seat of Orange County. Towards the northern side of Santa Ana, I-5 intersects both SR 57 and SR 22 in what is known as the Orange Crush interchange. Following this, I-5 briefly enters the city of Orange and then traverses Anaheim, passing along the north side of Disneyland. I-5 then intersects SR 91, passes through Buena Park and crosses into Los Angeles County. =Los Angeles County= Interstate 5 crosses the Los Angeles River twice; the northern of these is on the border between Los Angeles and Glendale I-5 in the Newhall Pass Interchange, where it meets the 210 and 14 freeways in northern Los Angeles After crossing the county line, I-5 goes through several cities southeast of Los Angeles, including La Mirada, Santa Fe Springs, and Norwalk. In Downey, I-5 intersects I-605, which serves as a north‚Äìsouth connector route between the cities east of Los Angeles, including those in the San Gabriel Valley. I-5 then enters Commerce, passing the Citadel Outlets shopping center, and intersects I-710 before entering the large unincorporated community of East Los Angeles and later the city proper of Los Angeles. When the freeway reaches the East Los Angeles Interchange one mile (1.6 km) east of downtown Los Angeles, I-5 becomes the Golden State Freeway as US 101 takes over the Santa Ana Freeway designation. At this interchange, I-10, SR 60, and US 101 intersect; I-10 continues north on I-5 for about before continuing east towards San Bernardino and points farther east. On the north side of downtown, the Golden State Freeway follows the Los Angeles River, intersects SR 110 and SR 2 and passes along the eastern side of Griffith Park. The route continues through the San Fernando Valley, intersecting the Ventura Freeway (SR 134). It briefly enters the city of Glendale and then Burbank, passing near Burbank Airport before reentering the Los Angeles city limits and intersecting the northern end of the Hollywood Freeway (SR 170). Near the city of San Fernando, I-5 intersects SR 118\\\\. Following this, I-5 intersects three routes in succession: the northern end of I-405, the western end of I-210, and the southern end of SR 14 at the Newhall Pass interchange. It then crosses the Newhall Pass through the Santa Susana Mountains into the Santa Clarita Valley. I-5's carpool lanes also have direct connectors with the carpool lanes on the SR 170 and SR 14 freeways (an additional direct connector with the HOV lanes on I-405 near Mission Hills is planned.http://media.metro.net/projects_studies/hov/images/hov_map.pdf) This allows a continuous HOV lane to run from Palmdale to North Hollywood via SR 14 to I-5 to SR 170\\\\. I-5 continues along the western city limits of Santa Clarita and passes Six Flags Magic Mountain, intersecting SR 126 just north of there. The Golden State Freeway then rises sharply, passing by Lake Castaic and undergoing a unique crossover resulting in a left-driving configuration for about 5 miles before the highway crosses back into its standard alignment. This stretch also boasts the second-largest median in California after I-8's In-Ko-Pah grade. It passes Pyramid Lake and intersects SR 138 before crossing the Tejon Pass through the Tehachapi Mountains, with Path 26 power lines generally paralleling the freeway.http://johncreid.com/2017/01/california- grid/ After entering Kern County, the freeway sharply descends for from at the Tejon Pass to at Grapevine near the southernmost point of the San Joaquin Valley, approximately south of Bakersfield and south of its interchange with SR 99 at Wheeler Ridge. Nearly every winter, the stretch of I-5 through the Tejon Pass and Grapevine is sometimes closed by the California Highway Patrol, generally because of the icy conditions combined with the steep grade of the pass, and the high traffic during the winter holidays. Whenever there is such a closure, traffic must either wait for it to reopen, or endure a multi-hour detour. In 2019, a gate was installed in the median of the Golden State Freeway in Castaic north of Lake Hughes Road to allow drivers to turn around when such closures occur. =Central Valley= I-5 in the Central Valley From SR 99 to south of Tracy, I-5 is known as the Westside Freeway. It parallels SR 33, skirting along the far more remote western edge of the Central Valley, and is largely removed from the major population centers such as Bakersfield, Fresno and Modesto; other state highways provide connections. I-5 still runs within the vicinity of Avenal, Coalinga, Los Banos, and a handful of other smaller cities on the western edge of the Central Valley. For most of this section, the Path 15 electrical transmission corridor follows the highway, forming an infrastructure corridor along with the California Aqueduct. After the Grapevine, I-5 crosses the California Aqueduct. This is first time out of 5 times that I-5 crosses the aqueduct. North of the Grapevine, I-5 intersects SR 166, SR 119 and SR 43 before meeting SR 58, a highway that continues east to Bakersfield, near the town of Buttonwillow. I-5 then intersects SR 46 before entering Kings County. From the Utica Avenue exit to I-580, I-5 parallels the eastern foothills of the Diablo Range. It crosses the California Aqueduct for the second time. In Kings County, I-5 intersects SR 41 before briefly entering the city limits of Avenal, where it intersects SR 269. In Fresno County, I-5 intersects SR 198 and SR 145 before running concurrently with SR 33 for several miles. I-5 then crosses into Merced County, intersecting SR 165, SR 152 near the San Luis Reservoir, and crosses the California Aqueduct for the third time (providing a major connection to the Monterey Peninsula and the Silicon Valley), SR 33, and SR 140 at the Stanislaus county line. I-5 also crosses the aqueduct near Crows Landing. I-5 in the Central Valley between Tracy and Patterson In San Joaquin County, I-580 splits off from I-5 south of Tracy, providing a spur-route connection to the San Francisco Bay Area. From here, I-5 crosses the California Aqueduct for the final time and intersects SR 132, a major route to Modesto and the mountains in the east, as well as the northern end of SR 33\\\\. After passing Tracy, I-5 intersects I-205, a connector route to I-580, before intersecting the SR 120 freeway near Manteca. After passing through Lathrop, I-5 heads due north through Stockton, intersecting the SR 4 freeway that provides access to downtown Stockton. I-5 passes through the western portion of the Lodi city limits before intersecting SR 12 and entering Sacramento County. I-5 enters the city of Elk Grove while passing along the eastern edge of the Stone Lakes National Wildlife Refuge. It then crosses into the Sacramento city limits, soon paralleling the Sacramento River before intersecting the Capital City Freeway, which carries US 50 and I-80 Business (I-80 Bus.). SR 99 merges with I-5 at this point, and the two routes pass through the western half of downtown Sacramento. Following the bridge over the American River, I-5 and SR 99 intersect the major transcontinental route of I-80. Just as I-5 leaves Sacramento, SR 99 splits off and continues north while I-5 turns due west past Sacramento International Airport and crosses the Sacramento River into Yolo County. In Woodland, the SR 113 freeway merges with I-5 before exiting to the north. The Interstate heads northwest again toward Dunnigan, where it converges with I-505. I-5 skirts north along the western edge of the Sacramento Valley, bypassing the larger cities of the region, including Yuba City, Oroville and Chico, before reaching Red Bluff. From Dunnigan, I-5 enters Colusa County, passing through the city of Williams and intersecting SR 20\\\\. In Glenn County, I-5 intersects SR 162 in Willows and SR 32 in Orland. I-5 then crosses into Tehama County, passing through Corning before entering Red Bluff and intersecting SR 36, which connects to the northern end of SR 99\\\\. I-5 crosses the Sacramento River twice before entering Shasta County. =Cascade Region= I-5 southbound approaching Weed and Mount Shasta I-5 then enters the Shasta Cascade region, intersecting SR 273 in Anderson before passing through Redding and intersecting SR 44 and SR 299\\\\. The freeway then continues through the city of Shasta Lake, intersecting SR 151, before crossing over Shasta Lake on a causeway and climbing up to near the foot of Mount Shasta. In Siskiyou County, I-5 passes through Dunsmuir before intersecting SR 89 near Lake Siskiyou and entering the city of Mount Shasta. North of here, US 97 intersects I-5 in Weed, providing access to Klamath Falls, Oregon. The Interstate then continues to Yreka, intersecting SR 3 and SR 96 before crossing the Klamath River and reaching the Oregon border and the Siskiyou Summit. History =Historical naming= The portion of this highway from Los Angeles to San Diego was also co-signed as U.S. Route 101 until late 1964. The portion of this highway from Woodland to Red Bluff roughly follows old US 99W. In California, the former western branch of Interstate 5 (the northern end of the spur into the Bay Area) connecting Interstate 80 out of Vacaville to near Dunnigan, previously known as Interstate 5W, was renamed Interstate 505. Interstate 580 running between I-5 and I-80 was also once designated 5W; what is now I-5 (the stretch that runs through Sacramento) had been originally designated Interstate 5E. The term \\"Golden State Highway\\" was the popular name for U.S. Route 99, stretching from Mexico to Canada through the length of California. Since the construction of I-5, it has taken over the term \\"Golden State Freeway\\" from 99 south of the latter's southern terminus in Kern County. =Los Angeles area= The Golden State Freeway was proposed by the California Highway Commission in 1953. The proposal drew strong criticism from East Los Angeles residents as it would dissect and eliminate large residential and commercial areas of Boyle Heights and Hollenbeck Heights. The proposal also seemed to indicate a disregard for the ethnic Mexican American population of metropolitan Los Angeles. The \\"Boyle‚ÄìHollenbeck Anti‚ÄìGolden State Freeway Committee\\" was formed for the purpose in blocking or rerouting the freeway. Then‚ÄìLos Angeles City Council member Edward R. Roybal chaired that committee. Despite this opposition, the construction of the freeway went ahead. When this section was completed in 1956, the newspaper The Eastside Sun wrote the freeway led to the \\"eradication, obliteration, razing, moving, ripping asunder, demolishing of Eastside homes.\\" The freeway between Orange County and Los Angeles was originally designed to have three lanes on each side. Due to high demand of cars, the freeway started undergoing major extensions and widening in the early 1990s in Orange County. Work from SR 91 north through the Los Angeles‚ÄìOrange County line was completed in 2010. The improvements between the county line and the East Los Angeles Interchange are scheduled to be complete by 2025. =Newhall Pass= The original route went through the towns of Saugus and Newhall, and then crossed Newhall Pass (current route of SR 14, the Antelope Valley Freeway). In 1862, Beale Cut was made in the construction of a toll wagon road. The 15' wide, 60' deep () \\"slot\\" was dug with picks and shovels. That road would become part of the Midway Route. At the turn of the century, it was the most direct automobile route between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley via the Mojave Desert and Tehachapi Pass. In 1910, Beale Cut was bypassed by the Newhall Tunnel. Constructed by Los Angeles County, it was too narrow for two trucks to pass each other inside. As a result, in 1939, the tunnel was completely removed (or \\"daylighted\\") when the road was widened to four lanes. Additionally, by 1930, a bypass road was constructed to avoid Newhall Pass via Weldon and Gavin canyons, which is the current route of I-5. Both routes were eventually built as freeways. The Gavin Canyon route became I-5, and the main north‚Äìsouth route via the Ridge Route. The Newhall Pass route became SR 14, which is the main route between Los Angeles and the growing high desert communities of the Antelope Valley. It is also still a part of the important Midway Route, which is the primary alternate route when I-5 is closed (via SR 58 and SR 14). The interchange has partially collapsed twice due to earthquakes: the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. As a result of the 1994 collapse, this interchange was renamed the \\"Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial Interchange\\", honoring a Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle officer killed when he was unable to stop in time and drove off the collapsed flyover ramp from SR 14 south to I-5 south. After both earthquakes, the collapsed portions were rebuilt and surviving portions reinforced. In the evening of October 12, 2007, two trucks collided in the southbound tunnel that takes the truck bypass roadway under the main lanes near the Newhall Pass interchange. Fifteen trucks caught fire, killing three people and injuring ten. =Ridge Route= View of the Grapevine loops looking north toward the San Joaquin Valley c. 1920, before the Ridge Route Alternate was built off to the left A section of the 1915 Ridge Route in Lebec, abandoned when US 99 (later upgraded to I-5) was constructed over the Tejon Pass in order to make the travel straighter and safer The Ridge Route refers to the section of highway between Castaic and Grapevine, through the Tejon Pass. The highway had its origins in the early 1910s, when a route was needed to connect Los Angeles to the Central Valley. Some believed that the only option was the route through Mojave and the Tehachapi Mountains, but a new route was discovered through the Tejon Pass. This route became known as the Ridge Route and saw almost constant planning, construction, and improvement from 1914 to 1970. The first road was completed in 1915. It was a slow, winding, two-lane road through the mountains with a speed limit of 15 mph in some places. However, the need for improvements was realized soon after it was completed. The road was paved after World War I, and several blind turns were opened up (\\"daylighted\\"). Even with these improvements in the 1920s, it became clear that a new route was needed to keep up with increasing demand. In 1927, plans were drawn up for a \\"Ridge Route Alternate\\", named as it was planned as an addition to the existing Ridge Route and not as a replacement. It opened in 1933 as a three-lane highway through the mountains. The middle or \\"suicide lane\\" was used as an overtaking lane for cars in both directions. This route was a great improvement, faster and shorter than the old Ridge Route, but was not enough to satisfy demand, and a conversion to a four-lane expressway was needed. The outbreak of World War II delayed this until 1948 and the fourth lane was completed in 1952. However, just three years later, plans were begun for converting the four-lane expressway to a six-lane freeway. The last major alteration to the Ridge Route began in the early 1960s. By then, the plan for a six-lane freeway had expanded to eight lanes. This construction project made the most changes to the route. Many of the curves that followed the mountainside were cut through. To climb the mountain on the south side of Castaic more easily, traffic lanes were reversed (southbound lanes to the east and northbound lanes to the west). To prevent head-on collisions, the two ends of the route were separated on two different mountainsides, and the section through Piru Canyon was moved to an entirely new alignment to make room for Pyramid Lake. The project was completed by 1970 and brought the Ridge Route to its current alignment. =San Joaquin Valley= When the Interstate Highway System was created in 1956, there was discussion about which way to route the interstate through the San Joaquin Valley (Central Valley). Two proposals were considered. One was to convert the Golden State Highway (U.S. Route 99, later CA Route 99) into a freeway. The other was to use the proposed West Side Freeway (current Interstate 5). The Golden State Highway route would serve many farming communities across the San Joaquin Valley, but the West Side Freeway proposal would bypass all the Central Valley communities and thus provide a faster and more direct north‚Äìsouth route through the state and so was eventually chosen. Construction began in the early 1960s. There were just three phases for the . The first phase, completed in 1967, ran from the San Joaquin County line to Los Banos. The second phase, completed in 1972, extended the freeway south to Wheeler Ridge and connected it to SR 99\\\\. The freeway then started to see traffic, as in Stockton there were only between the West Side Freeway and the Golden State Highway. The third phase, completed in 1979, extended the freeway to Sacramento and connected it to the northern I-5. When the second phase of the freeway opened in 1972, it was a long and lonely route with no businesses alongside. Services were not easily available as the nearest towns were miles away and generally out of sight. It was common for cars to run out of fuel. Over time the West Side Freeway (I-5) saw the development of businesses serving the needs of travelers. For years, there has still been interest in designating the Golden State Highway route as its own interstate, Interstate 9. The median on I-5 between Wheeler Ridge and Tracy is wide enough to accommodate widening the West Side Freeway to six or eight lanes, should the need arise. =I-5W and the San Francisco Bay Area= Interstate 5's more direct Los Angeles-to-Sacramento route bypasses San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area. Original plans also called for a loop Interstate with a directional suffix, I-5W. This route now roughly corresponds to I-580 from I-5 south of Tracy to Oakland, I-80 from Oakland to Vacaville, and I-505 from Vacaville to I-5 near Dunnigan. I-5W and most of the other Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated, except I-35E and I-35W in Texas and Minnesota. Nevertheless, San Francisco is still listed as a control city on northbound I-5 between SR 99 and I-580. =Sacramento area= Interstate 5 in downtown Sacramento closely follows the Sacramento River. This has resulted in complex engineering work to keep the section dry due to it being located below the water table. Locally, Caltrans refers to this part of the freeway as the \\"Boat Section\\". Due to record levels of rainfall in 1980 the Boat Section was flooded with of water. Caltrans began constructing this section during the 1960s and 1970s. The freeway was engineered below grade so it would be out of the view of offices and shops in Downtown Sacramento. To achieve this, the site was excavated and the seeping water was pumped from the area. An intricate drainage system, water pump and retaining wall are used to protect the freeway from the Sacramento River. However, the system slowly clogged up over the years with sand and silt buildup Major repair work of the Boat Section began on May 30, 2008. The construction was to take 40 days to complete, requiring complete northbound and southbound closures on an alternating schedule. Exit list =Newhall Pass truck route= The I-5 truck route through the Newhall Pass Interchange in Sylmar has its own separate exits.

It was charted and named by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, 1901‚Äì04, under Otto Nordenski√∂ld. The bay was previously visited by the Jason, Captain C.A. Larsen, in 1894.  Named features  Several features in and around Jason Harbour have been charted by various Antarctic expeditions. Unless otherwise noted, the following features were charted and named by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel in 1929. Boat Harbor is a small circular harbour on the east coast of Jason Harbour. The name appears to be first used on a 1930 British Admiralty chart. A group of rocks called the Breakwater Rocks extends across the south part of the entrance to Boat Harbour. The feature was initially named The Breakwater, probably by Lieutenant Commander J.M. Chaplin, Royal Navy, during his survey of Jason Harbour in 1929. The South Georgia Survey (SGS) of 1956‚Äì1957, reported that the name was misleading; the rocks are not in a continuous straight line forming a natural breakwater, but are in a group. The name was therefore altered to \\"Breakwater Rocks\\" by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1957. Wood Point marks the entrance of Little Jason Lagoon to the north. Little Jason Lagoon, a near-circular lagoon sits at the head of the harbour, separated from it by a narrow peninsula. So narrow is the channel into Little Jason Lagoon that it was initially named Nogood Lagoon by DI personnel. The SGS of 1951‚Äì1952, reported that the feature is known locally as Little Jason. The name Little Jason Lagoon was approved in order to indicate the nature of the feature, and at the same time to conform with local usage. The narrow peninsula separating the lagoon from the harbour ends in Lagoon Point, first called Bluff Point by DI but renamed on a 1930 British Admiralty chart. On the same narrow peninsula as Lagoon Point sits The Split Pin, a twin pinnacle rock formation high, also charted by DI. Tor Point forms the east side of the entrance to Jason Harbor. The name appears to be first used on a 1930 British Admiralty chart.

He was born in St. Petersburg, Russia on May 17, 1900, graduating from the Imperial Capella with honors when he was sixteen. As a young boy singer in the chapel choir, he recalled singing for the Tsar's family and Rasputin. He tells in the book Duet with Nicky of how the choirboys would tear pages from their hymnals to make spit-balls which they would aim at Rasputin. He later served as musical director of the School of Modern Art in Moscow and as first violinist at the Moscow Grand Opera. In 1922, he made a harrowing escape from the Soviet Union in disguise, only to be arrested in Poland, but was released by an official who remembered hearing him perform. Once settled in New York, Berezowsky attended the Juilliard School of Music, studying under Paul Kochanski and Rubin Goldmark. He was first violinist with the New York Philharmonic for the first seven years of his U.S. residence. He played in the Coolidge String Quartet from 1935-1940. He was a prot√©g√© of Serge Koussevitzky, who premiered his symphonies to great acclaim. He married Alice Newman, a notable pianist, who later published a memoir, \\"Duet with Nicky\\" about their early years together (Lippincott) (Alice was the sister of chemist Melvin Spencer Newman and the granddaughter of New Orleans investment banker and philanthropist Isidore Newman).\\"Newman, Jacob K.,\\" in: James Terry White, The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, v. 33, New York: J.

Among Berezowsky's works are an opera, Prince Batrak, four symphonies, concertos for harp, violin and 'cello, and many diverse works of chamber music. His recordings include an LP set of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, which he conducted. He enjoyed a great success with his children's opera Babar, and his oratorio Gilgamesh. His Concerto for Harp was commissioned by Edna Phillips, who gave the premiere with the Philadelphia Orchestra, and performed by Carlos Salzedo with the National Orchestra Association under Leon Barzin with an original cadenza by Salzedo, included in the edition published by Theodore Presser.

The transmitter is near Attica, but the studios are in Burton, east of Flint. It is owned by Townsquare Media and the home of two local sports teams: the Ontario Hockey League's Flint Firebirds and Lapeer Lightning high school football.We Are Your Home For Lapeer Lightning Football WQUS, August 27, 2019 History WTHM-FM first went on the air February 6, 1968, and was for many years a simulcast outlet of its like-named AM sister station (known today as WLCO), with the call letters standing for The Thumb area of east central Michigan. WTHM-AM/FM was a full- service station featuring MOR/adult contemporary music. WTHM-FM allowed Lapeer residents to have local radio service after its daytime-only AM station was mandated to shut down at sunset. Later on the call letters on both AM and FM were switched to WDEY; the music format remained AC. WDEY-AM/FM had been owned for many years by James Sommerville, who sold both to Covenant Communications in 1991. Five years following the acquisition by Covenant, the FM station, by this time known as WWGZ-FM (Wings 103), had switched to an album rock format and became more of a regional station, serving listeners in Flint. The AM station adopted an all-sports format and the new call letters WLSP, later going all-talk and then adult standards prior to the current \\"Real Country\\" format as WLCO. In 1998 WWGZ-FM changed its calls to WRXF (Radio X) and took on a more Active Rock/Heavy metal sound. One Radio X veteran, Tony LaBrie, is now the Music Director and an on-air personality at 103.1 FM's sister station WWBN. Both WLSP-AM and WRXF-FM were sold in December 2001 to Regent Communications (now Townsquare Media) for $1.3 million. Shortly after the transaction was announced, WRXF ended its independent programming and became a simulcast of its new FM sister station, WWBN \\"Banana 101.5\\". The simulcast ended almost three months later, when 103.1 once again became independently programmed, under its present call letters, format and moniker. Both stations then moved from their longtime location at 286 West Nepessing Street in Lapeer to join their new Regent affiliate stations at G-3338 East Bristol Road in the Flint suburb of Burton. U.S. 103.1's format has a base of Classic Rock/Classic Hits, but the station also plays some alternative rock and other rock songs from the 1990s (such as \\"Counting Blue Cars\\" by Dishwalla) and up to recurrent product (such as \\"Paralyzer\\" by Finger Eleven).

It was discovered by the Discovery Expedition (1901‚Äì1904) and named for Lieutenant Charles Royds, Royal Navy, who acted as meteorologist on the expedition. Royds subsequently rose to become an Admiral and was later Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, London. There is a hut at Cape Royds built and used by Ernest Shackleton and his team during their 1907‚Äì1909 expedition. Shackleton's Hut A group of explorers from Shackleton's Nimrod expedition, 1907‚Äì1909, in the Antarctic hut at Cape Royds When Shackleton went into McMurdo Sound in 1908, having failed to land on King Edward VII Land, he decided to build a hut at Cape Royds, a small promontory twenty-three miles north of Hut Point where Scott had stayed during the Discovery Expedition. The whole shore party lived in this hut through the winter of 1908. When spring came stores were sledged to Hut Point, so that should the sea-ice break up early between these two places they might not be left in an awkward position. Shackleton did not return to the hut after his farthest south attempt, however he had left full instructions with Professor Edgeworth David as to the care of the hut, and before the whole Expedition left, the hut was put in order. A letter was pinned in a conspicuous place inside, stating that there were sufficient provisions and equipment to last fifteen men for one year, indicating also the details of these provisions and the position of the coal store. The stove was in good condition, and the letter ended with an invitation for any succeeding party to make what use they required of stores and hut. The hut was then locked and the key nailed on the door in a conspicuous place. Scott could have used this as a base during the Terra Nova Expedition, given that it was unlikely to suffer the sea ice problem that afflicted Hut Point, but he had reached an agreement with Shackleton that neither would use each other's facilities. The only visit to Shackleton's hut made during Scott's 1910‚Äì1913 expedition was by a former member of Shackleton's expedition. Shackleton's hut was found intact, with bread still on the tables just as it had been left. Raymond Priestley, who had walked out the door of the building two years previously, described coming back to the place as 'very eerie'. Priestley retrieved a tin of butter, tins of jam, a plum pudding and gingerbread biscuits from the site, all of which were described as being perfectly fresh. Amongst other things, five crates of McKinlay and Co. whisky were found buried under the hut in 2006.Shackleton's whisky to be dug up One crate is currently in Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand undergoing restoration and, if possible, analysis of the whisky. =Historic site= The Antarctic Heritage Trust (New Zealand) has custody over the site. Nominated by AHT, Shackleton's Hut was listed in the 2004, 2006, and 2008 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund to attract attention and financial support for the site. In 2004, through WMF, funding for conservation was provided by American Express, and by 2008 the structure was fully restored to its condition when Shackleton's team left it. Shackleton's Hut has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 15), following a proposal by New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.  Geographical features  Some features on the cape have been charted and individually named by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907‚Äì09, under Ernest Shackleton. Flagstaff Point is the cape's southernmost point. Shackleton's expedition established its winter headquarters and erected a flag near the point. The dark volcanic sand beach 0.5 nautical miles (1 km) southward of Flagstaff Point is named Blacksand Beach. Shackleton's expedition found the beach within safe walking distance of their base hut near Flagstaff Point and gave it its descriptive name. Antarctic Specially Protected Area An area of 6200 ha at the cape is protected as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 121, incorporating HSM 15) because it supports the southernmost established Ad√©lie penguin colony known, with a long period of population data. The presence of polynyas in McMurdo Sound provides an ice-free area where penguins can feed, and is important for the survival of the penguin colony. The area is also important for its terrestrial and freshwater ecology; it is the type locality for several species of algae, including the southernmost record of snow algae.

Scoring the film Composer Monty Norman was selected by producer Albert R. Broccoli after Broccoli backed a musical of Norman's Belle or The Ballad of Dr. Crippen written by Wolf Mankowitz, a frequent collaborator with Norman and an original screenwriter for Dr. No. Norman's only previous film score had been The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll (1960). Norman traveled to Jamaica on the same chartered aircraft as the producers and many of the film's crew arriving on 14 January 1962. He met Chris Blackwell, a location scout and production assistant recommended to the producers by Ian Fleming. Blackwell introduced Norman to Byron Lee and the Dragonairesp. 278 Parker, Matthew Goldeneye: Where Bond Was Born: Ian Fleming's Jamaica Random House, 21 May 2015 who performed the Jamaican music in the film. Lee and his band including guitarist Ernest Ranglin and trombonist Carlos Malcolm recorded the Jamaican parts of the score in Kingston's Federal Studios, with Norman himself and his then wife Diana Coupland who accompanied Norman on the airplane containing the film's crew to Jamaica, recording vocals along with Byron Lee and the Dragonaires who appear in the film performing \\"Jump Up\\".Burlingame, Jon The Music of James Bond Oxford University Press, 1 Oct 2012 The song \\"Under the Mango Tree\\" was performed by an uncredited Diana Coupland, backed by Ernest Ranglin on guitar.Burlingame, Jon (2012) The Music of James Bond, OUP USA, , p. 5‚Äì11 Ranglin also played on several other tracks. Lee recalled that most of their work was not used in the completed film but appeared on the soundtrack album. The rest of Norman's score was orchestrated by his frequent arranger Bert Rhodes, to whom Norman gave half of his ¬£500 fee, and was recorded at CTS Studios, 49‚Äì53 Kensington Gardens Square, Bayswater, London on 25 and 26 June 1962 with the 20‚Äì30 piece orchestra conducted by Eric Rogers. None of the orchestrated tracks appear on the soundtrack album. The original \\"James Bond Theme\\" was written by Norman. John Barry, who would later go on to compose the music for eleven Bond films, arranged the theme, but was uncredited ‚Äì except for the credit of his orchestra playing the final piece. John Barry claimed he, not Norman, originated the theme. This argument has been the subject of two court cases, the most recent in 2001. Some portions of the theme Norman claimed were based on music he composed for a never staged musical several years previously. Vic Flick, the guitar player on the James Bond Theme states: > Norman is famous for writing the music to the first James Bond movie Dr No, > and has been credited with writing the \\"James Bond Theme\\", the signature > theme of the James Bond franchise. Norman has received royalties since 1962 > for the theme, but it was arranged by John Barry after the producers were > dissatisfied with Norman's music. Barry claims that he actually did write > the theme, but nevertheless, Mr. Norman won two libel actions against > publishers for claiming that Barry was the composer, most recently against > The Sunday Times in 2001. During the trial, Barry testified on the stand > that he had composed the James Bond Theme, but that Norman was contractually > obligated to receive credit for the score. The soundtrack album of Dr. No was not originally issued to coincide with the film's initial release in October 1962. However, in addition to his fee for orchestrating the \\"James Bond Theme\\", Barry was allowed to perform a different orchestration of the theme on Columbia Records. This became a top ten hit in the UK. The soundtrack album came out after the U.S. release of Dr. No in June 1963 with American cover version single recordings of \\"The James Bond Theme\\" by Al Caiola and Leroy Holmes on United Artists Records and Si Zentner on Liberty Records. One musical theme that appears in three different orchestrations on the album: \\"Dr. No's Fantasy\\", \\"Twisting with James\\" and the misleadingly entitled \\"The James Bond Theme\\" (track 17 on the album, but entirely unrelated to the \\"track 1\\"), is not heard anywhere in the film. Diana Coupland recalled that it was Norman's first attempt at a '\\"James Bond Theme\\"'. Notable omissions from the soundtrack include the film's opening sci- fi electronic music sound effects (provided by Daphne Oram)/\\"James Bond Theme\\" gun barrel sequence, and Eric Rogers' symphonic arrangements of Norman's score including a brief theme for Miss Moneypenny, the music from the tarantula scene, and Dr. No's death (reused during the climax of the helicopter attack in From Russia with Love but not on that soundtrack album either).

Licensed to St. Johns, Michigan, it first began broadcasting in 1972 and has been through a number of different calls and formats during its history. History 92.1 FM was originally WRBJ-FM, and, in a simulcast with WRBJ (now WWSJ)/1580, served St. Johns and Clinton County as a full-service local station. Original owner Robert Ditmer sold WRBJ-AM-FM in 1981 and changed both stations to a country simulcast as WQTK-AM-FM, the first of many identity changes over the next twenty years for the AM 1580 frequency (see the WWSJ article for more). The calls eventually became WKLH-FM, continuing with a country format as \\"K-92\\", until Labor Day 1985, when WKLH-FM became WLNZ, \\"The Lazer\\", with a rock format (the \\"lazer\\" part of the positioning referring to the station's being the first in the Lansing market to play music from compact discs). WLNZ changed to CHR/Top 40 first as \\"Z-92\\" and later as \\"The Ape\\" WGOR (as in \\"gorilla\\") in 1989, but found its ratings success against WVIC limited and its advertising revenue even worse. One more unsuccessful format followed - smooth jazz and new-age music as WXMX \\"The Mix\\" from 1991 to 1993, before the station debuted what would become its most successful format yet. In 1993, 92.1 FM became WWDX (\\"92-1 The Edge\\"), a modern rock station and the first such commercial radio station in Michigan in this format outside the Detroit area. Despite its limited signal reach, WWDX finally became a ratings success as \\"The Edge,\\" due largely to the large college-student population in the area. On September 17, 2003, at 1:50 p.m., it changed format to hot AC as WKMY \\"My 92.1.\\" The death of \\"The Edge\\" left the decidedly non-commercial WDBM from Michigan State University as the only source for alternative rock music in the market, and left many of WWDX's loyal listeners very angry. The format and moniker would resurface again on its sister station, WVIC, in August 2009. Following the change to \\"My 92.1,\\" the station plummeted in the ratings, with the station changing calls to WTXQ and began to simulcast a sports-talk format with WQTX-FM 92.7 as \\"The Ticket\\" at 6:00 p.m. on July 14, 2004. On March 31, 2006, months after WJIM-FM dropped its long-running oldies format in favor of Top 40 in the fall of 2005, WTXQ changed its calls to the current WQTX (WQTX 92.7 is now Top 40/CHR WLMI 92.9) and switched from sports talk to oldies, using a satellite-delivered format from Jones Radio Networks. On September 2, 2008, Oldies 92.1 added a live and local morning show, hosted by Lansing broadcast veteran Tim Barron. On December 1, 2008, WQTX changed its format and name to Classic Hits 92-X WQTX, with a new logo. On March 17, 2010, it was announced that the Rubber City Radio Group, based in Akron, Ohio, was planning to sell WQTX, along with sister stations WWDK (formerly WVIC), WJXQ, and WLMI (formerly WJZL), to Midwest Communications. The deal officially closed on July 1, 2010. On December 27, 2010, sister station WLMI changed its format to classic hits. The format moved from WQTX, which began stunting toward a new format. From December 27 to January 4, it was a liner redirecting people to 92.9 if they wanted to continue listening to the classic hits format. On January 5, it was a loop of the song Tomorrow from the musical Annie. On the 6th, until 3 PM, it was a loop of the song I Gotta Feeling by The Black Eyed Peas, emphasizing the lyric \\"That tonight's gonna be a good night.\\" On January 6, 2011, at 3:00 p.m., WQTX debuted a 90's-leaning country format, branded as \\"92.1 Big Country\\". On February 25, 2013, WQTX announced that they will be the new Lansing radio home of \\"Michigan's BIG Show starring Michael Patrick Shiels\\". On January 9, 2015, it was announced that WQTX would flip back to sports talk, again branded as \\"92.1 The Ticket\\", only January 19. The first host on the newly revived \\"Ticket\\" was Jack Ebling, former afternoon host at WVFN. The station continues to air local sports play-by-play from area high schools. Shortly after the flip, the moniker suddenly changed to \\"The Team\\". This was due to WXYT-FM in Detroit owning the southern Michigan rights to the Ticket moniker (WKAD in Northern Michigan is the Ticket).Ticket Returning to Lansing from RadioInsight January 9th, 2014 On September 4, 2018, the Lansing State Journal reported that WQTX would drop the sports format at 6AM the following day and flip to a '90s/2000s hits format as \\"Fuel 92.1\\". The change came because, as Midwest Communications VP/market manager Mark Jaycox had told the paper, the sports format was unprofitable to run. ‚ÄúMichigan‚Äôs Big Show‚Äù will move to WJIM in a delayed 9am-12pm slot, while the afternoon ‚ÄúDrive with Jack Ebling and Tom Crawford‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpartan Beat with Rico Beard‚Äù will both remain available online.WQTX Lansing to Drop Sports & Fuel Up On March 26, 2020, after stunting with a loop of \\"The Song That Never Ends\\" for two days, WQTX flipped to rhythmic adult contemporary as Stacks 92.1 (alluding to the smokestacks of the Eckert Power Plant on Lansing's skyline).

It took place in November 1875, in and around Las Cuevas, Tamaulipas. The Texans crossed the Rio Grande into Mexican territory with the purpose of returning stolen cattle to the American side of the river but they were drawn into a battle with local militia forces. When the fighting was over the Mexicans returned the cattle to the Texans. Battle  Captain Leander McNelly in 1875. McNelly and his rangers entered Mexico November 20. Under cover of brush and scrub oak, they made their way on foot to the stronghold of Juan Flores Salinas, local leader of the rural guard, at the Rincon de Cucharras outpost of the Las Cuevas ranch. The ensuing shoot-out pitted rangers against an estimated four hundred of Salinas' men. Totally outnumbered and fearing the mounted Mexicans would surround his men, McNelly ordered his men to pull back to the river to make a stand. At the river, about half the United States Army 24th Infantry and the 8th Cavalry, under Lieutenant Colonel James F. Randlett, had lined up on the Texas side. In the melee that followed, with the aid of the army firing a Gatling gun on the Mexicans, Juan Salinas, Alcalde of Camargo, and eighty of his \\"banditos\\" died on the riverbank. The fighting wasn't over. It was a Mexican standoff with the militia retreating to regroup after their leader's death, and McNelly refusing to back down from his demands on the return of the stolen cattle. Later that afternoon, Major A. J. Alexander from Fort Ringgold arrived with a message from Colonel Potter at Fort Brown, located on the Rio Grande at Brownsville: > \\"Advise Captain McNelly to return at once to this side of the river. Inform > him that you are directed not to support him in any way while he remains on > Mexican territory. If McNelly is attacked by Mexican forces on Mexican soil, > do not render him any assistance. Let me know if McNelly acts on this > advice.\\" McNelly carefully read the telegram and then issued four terse > words. \\"The answer is no.\\" At sundown, another message arrived: > Major Alexander, commanding: Secretary of War [William W.] Belknap orders > you to demand McNelly return at once to Texas. Do not support him in any > manner. Inform the Secretary if McNelly acts on these orders and returns to > Texas. Signed, Colonel Potter. In less than a minute, Captain McNelly penned his now famous reply: > Near Las Cuevas, Mexico, Nov. 20 1875. I shall remain in Mexico with my > rangers and cross back at my discretion. Give my compliments to the > Secretary of War and tell him and his United States soldiers to go to hell. > Signed, Lee H. McNelly, commanding. After a rested night's sleep, Captain McNelly moved his men directly opposite Camargo on the Texas side of the river. It was now Sunday, and the stolen cattle had been moved and penned in a corral, but still on the Mexican side of the border and under guard by plenty of armed horsemen riding herd. Diego Garcia, a Camargo official next in charge to the dead alcade, promised to move the cattle across by 3:00 pm. McNelly, however, was suspicious and pulled his men to Rio Grande City to relax while he made his plans. At 3:00 pm, McNelly returned to the ferry landing, took sixteen rangers in addition to himself, and crossed the river in a rowboat in another invasion of Mexico. He also took along five horses. The \\"Death Squad,\\" as they have come to be known, were composed of Captain McNelly, Lieutenant Thomas Robinson, Lieutenant Jesse Lee Hall, alias Frank Bones, Sergeant George A. Hall, Sergeant John Barclay Armstrong, Sergeant R. P. Orrell, Corporal William L. Rudd, and Rangers Lincoln Rogers Dunnison, Randolph D. Scipio, Robert H. Pitts, William Crump Callicott, Thomas McGovern, Horace G. Mabin, Thomas Sullivan acting as interpreter, George Durham, and Jesus Sandoval, also an interpreter. James R. Wofford is listed in one account as also being along. It is known for certain that the five mounted men were Robinson, Sandoval, Hall, Armstrong, and Orrell. The squad marched up the riverbank to the customs house and demanded the cattle. When the Mexican captain stated they didn't do business on Sunday, the Texans promptly took him prisoner. McNelly then hauled the prisoner to the Texas side and told the captured Mexican leader to get the cattle started within the hour or he would die. Instead of 250 head returning to Texas, more than 400 were crossed back. Nearly every brand in the Nueces Strip was in the herd, from the King Ranch's \\"Running W\\" up near Corpus Christi to Hale and Parker's \\"Half-moon\\" brand over near Brownsville.

Licensed to Roscommon, Michigan, it first began broadcasting in 1990. WGRY-FM is owned by Sheryl and Gerald Coyne, through licensee Blarney Stone Broadcasting, Inc., and is co-owned with WMQU and WQON, at its facilities in Grayling. History: beginnings as WGRY-FM WGRY-FM's roots can be traced back to as early as 1978, when a radio station in Grayling debuted at 100.1 FM with the call letters WQON, competing against separately-owned MOR/country music-formatted WGRY/1590 (now 1230). Both stations would compete against one another for ten years, until William S. Gannon purchased WGRY in 1988. In 1990, Gannon Broadcasting was granted Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval to construct a new station licensed to Roscommon broadcasting at 101.1 on the FM dial. The Construction Permit originally bore the WLAI calls but never was on the air with that call sign. WGRY-FM made its debut on March 12 of that year at 6,000 watts, broadcasting out of the same studio, located in Grayling, as its sister station WGRY. Gannon Broadcasting, in the growth mode, continued to look for other properties to add to its Broadcast enterprise. The opportunity to buy WQON-FM 100.1 presented itself in 1994. The station had been granted a construction permit to substantially increase its power, but its ownership at that time chose to sell the station and concentrate their interests on their AM station in the Lansing area. Taking advantage of a peculiar situation, Gannon Broadcasting acquired WQON-FM and moved its studios to the WGRY-AM-FM location. In a move to take advantage of a strong country format, Gannon Broadcasting Systems requested approval from the FCC to allow WQON-FM and WGRY-FM to switch frequencies and to move the former WQON from 100.1 to 100.3. This would permit Gannon Broadcasting Systems to increase from 3,000 to 26,500 watts. Then Gannon Broadcasting Systems made improvements to equipment and built a new 1,350 sq. ft. addition to the original WGRY-AM studio to accommodate the three stations. Hiring a high powered engineering firm, Gannon gained approval from the FCC and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1995 to increase its power to 60,000 watts with an option to move to a full 100,000 watts, making Y-100.3 WGRY a regional powerhouse. With the moves completed for the new WGRY-FM 100.3, Gannon Broadcasting made the \\"new\\" WQON a strong local \\"listen-at-work\\" radio station, using Jones Radio Network's \\"Soft Hits\\" adult contemporary format, and branding the station as \\"Decades 101\\". The station continued with the AC format through Jones Radio Networks' sale to Triton Media Group which owns the Dial Global stable of formats. Decades 101 WGRY simulcast WQON full-time from 1995 until the turn of the 21st century, when it was given its own identity once again. WGRY was re-branded in January 2001 with the \\"Music of Your Life\\" format from \\"Jones Radio Network\\", which provided satellite-delivered music programming for WQON and WGRY-FM, outside of morning drive. Decades 101 became a standalone station. WGRY remains a standards format today but has since switched from Music of Your Life to Dial Global's America's Best Music. Dave Sherbert, operations manager for the three stations, first joined WGRY-AM-FM in 1992. He eventually became the morning personality on Decades 101.1 FM WQON. The remainder of the station remained satellite-fed from Dial Global. Sale and change to Y101.1 In July 2012, it was announced that WQON and sister stations WGRY and WGRY-FM were being sold by William Gannon to Sheryl and Jerry Coyne (d/b/a Blarney Stone Broadcasting, Inc.). Gannon expressed a desire to get out of the broadcasting business after suffering a stroke in the summer of 2011. No change to the station's adult contemporary format was planned although the Coynes expressed a desire to add more local programming.\\"Gannon Broadcasting in Process of Selling Stations,\\" CrawfordCountyAvalanche.com. http://www.crawfordcountyavalanche.com/articles/2012/07/12/news/doc4ffd93bad5217472072989.txt. 11 July 2012, Retrieved 18 July 2012.

On 3 February 2012, the building was topped out. In December 2013, ORCO terminated its contract with the general construction contractor Inso. As of the end of 2013, investment was called by ORCO a \\"major financial failure for the Group in the fall of 2013\\". ORCO announced a ‚Ç¨121 million (around 500 million PLN) write-down of the value of the building. The company went on to announce its intention to sell it as fast as possible. One of the banks financing the construction terminated its contract and wanted the loan refunded (250 million PLN). The developer also disclosed that the high prices of apartments (65,000 PLN per square meter, at the time the highest in Poland) were artificially inflated to generate media coverage. On 28 August 2014, the sale of Z≈Çota 44 was finalized. The building was sold from ORCO to Amstar and BBI Development for ‚Ç¨50 million (about 215 million PLN), which was a small fraction of its construction cost, estimated at 700 million PLN.

Background The attack is thought to have happened in retaliation for the arrest of the President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegoviƒá, who was detained at the Sarajevo Airport by the Yugoslav army the previous day. Attack The attack started with the convoy being separated when a car was driven into it. Then sporadic and disorganized fighting took place for several minutes in and around the convoy. Bosnian army commander Sefer Halilovic later stated about the incident \\"our fighters and civilians acted spontaneously, they cut the convoy in half.\\" In his book Peacekeeper: The road to Sarajevo, the UN peacekeepers' commander, General Lewis MacKenzie, who was in the convoy described what he saw: \\"I could see the Territorial Defense soldiers push the rifles through the windows of civilians' cars, which were part of the convoy, and shoot [...] I saw blood flow down the windshields. It was definitely the worst day of my life.\\" Aftermath Serb prosecutors stated that 42 JNA soldiers were killed in the attack on May 2 and 3 throughout Sarajevo and have named case that covers these events \\"Case Dobrovoljaƒçka\\". General Milutin Kukanjac, the commander of the JNA in Sarajevo, confirmed that just in Dobrovoljaƒçka street alone 4 officers, one soldier and one civilian were killed in the attack. Controversy An investigation was opened by the Serbian Prosecutors Office and has stirred controversy both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Two members of the State Presidency, Haris Silajd≈æiƒá and ≈Ωeljko Kom≈°iƒá, claimed Serbia‚Äôs action breached the Rome Agreement.https://web.archive.org/web/20100619162403/http://www.ohr.int/ohr- dept/hr-rol/thedept/war-crime-tr/default.asp?content_id=6093 The presidents attended a meeting with members of the wartime Presidency of Bosnia, namely Tatjana Ljujiƒá-Mijatoviƒá, Ivo Kom≈°iƒá, Miro Lazoviƒá and Ejup Ganiƒá, and concluded that Serbia had breached the 1996 Rome Agreement, failed to seek the ICTY‚Äôs opinion before taking action and had \\"therefore breached international legal provisions\\". A Belgrade court issued arrest warrants for 19 former Bosnian-government officials. Ejup Ganiƒá, a former member of the Bosnian wartime presidency who was among the people sought for the attack, dismissed the allegations, indicating the attack on the JNA column was aimed at striking at Izetbegoviƒá's kidnappers after his capture by Bosnian Serb forces. Ganiƒá was arrested in London, but was quickly released since Judge Timothy Workman ruled that the JNA was an enemy army at war with Bosnia and Herzegovina and thus, a legitimate target. In 2003 The International Tribunal for Justice dismissed the case, stating that the actions of the ArBiH did not constitute a breach of law. On 3 March 2011, Jovan Divjak was arrested in Vienna due to Serbia's arrest warrant. However, Austria said it will not extradite him to Belgrade. In 2003, the ICTY also ruled that there was no ground for prosecution of Divjak. In 2012, the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina did the same.

Cudmore studied law at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1910, then returned to Australia and formed a partnership with Stanley Murray. He practiced law until 1955. An officer in the Royal Field Artillery Special Reserve, Cudmore commanded a battery in France during the First World War. He was wounded twice, and as a result was plagued by back problems for the rest of his life. Political career Returning from Europe in 1919, Cudmore became interested Australian politics. He was involved in the administration of the State Repatriation Board, the Soldiers' Fund, and the South Australian Sailors and Soldiers' Distress Fund. As vice-president of the South Australian Liberal Federation, he was a force behind its 1932 merger with the Country Party to form the Liberal and Country League. In 1933 Cudmore was elected to the Legislative Council to represent Adelaide Central District No.2. From 1934‚Äì36 he was president of the Liberal and Country League. From 1939 to 1959, when he retired, he was the leader of his party in the Upper House. Cudmore was an outspoken opponent of Thomas Playford IV's nationalization of the Adelaide Electric Company, which was owned by Murray, and constituted a major draw on a treasury already at its limits. The bill was defeated at first. However, when the bill was reintroduced in 1946, he absented himself from a key division, allowing the bill to pass.http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150570b.htm A liberal conservative, Cudmore pursued a reform agenda that often conflicted with the more traditionalist members of his party, most particularly Playford. He advocated harsher sentences for child abusers, a parliamentary public accounts committee, relaxed gaming regulation, extended liquor trading hours, and the establishment of a well-regulated red-light district, often working with the Labor government to achieve his aims from opposition. Cudmore also achieved animal protection laws, pensions for supreme court judges, and mandatory tuberculosis examinations. He was knighted in 1958.It's an Honour .

The Suburban Baths were publicly owned, as were also the Stabian, Forum, and Central baths in the city. They were built in the early empire, possibly under the Emperor Tiberius (14‚Äì37 AD),L.Jacobelli,\\"Lo scavo delle Terme Suburbane. Notizie preliminari,\\" Rivista di studi pompeiani, 1987, vol. 1, pp. 151‚Äì4 much later than the others and thus were located outside the walls where land was more easily available; by this time the walls had lost their defensive role. The baths also benefitted from the increased supply of running water after the connection of the city to the Aqua Augusta aqueduct in 30‚Äì20 BC. The bathhouse was renovated after the earthquake of 62 AD, in which a piscina calida, a heated swimming pool, was added to the north of the complex. They were originally discovered in 1958, much later than the rest of the city, though a systematic excavation had to wait until 1985‚Äì1987, which gave us valuable new insights into aspects of social and cultural workings of Roman life in Pompeii.Dobbins, John; Foss, Pedar (2007). The World of Pompeii. New York: Routledge: Taylor and Francis Group. p. 241 Although publicly owned, these baths seem to have been reserved for a private clientele unlike the other public baths.H. Jacobelli, ‚ÄúDie Suburbanen Thermen in Pompei: Architektur, Raumfunktion und Ausstattung,‚Äù Archaeologisches Korrespondenzblatt, 1993, vol. 23, pp. 327‚Äì35; J. DeLaine and D. E. Johnston (eds), Roman Baths and Bathing. Part 2. Design and Context, JRA Suppl. Ser. no. 37.2, 2000. The building is notable for its surviving erotic wall paintings, the only set of such art found in a public Roman bath house.  Structure  The building was a two-storey structure: the upper floor, as in the Palaestra/Sarno baths, was subdivided into three apartments for rent, with views towards the port and the Bay of Naples through the large glass windows. These rooms may also have provided space for the selling of sexual services. This upper floor was either accessed by a staircase from the floor below or via a door on the Via Marina. The baths were built to a higher standard of luxury and thermal effectiveness than the earlier baths in the town and have many hallmarks of the ‚Äúnewer‚Äù bath architecture of the 1st century AD: \\"single-axis row\\" type (with rooms in a linear increasingly warm arrangement promoting a particular route through the baths and bordering a palaestra) , large windows facing southwest, and an outdoor pool with a fountain. Nymphaeum with waterfall cascades in frigidarium Construction was first limited to the apodyterium (dressing room), frigidarium (cold room), tepidarium (warm room), laconicum and calidarium (hot room); the natatio was added later as three rooms, including a nymphaeum with a water cascade, providing an alternative route to the existing one of the tepidarium followed by the calidarium.Luciana Jacobelli, The erotic paintings of the Suburban Baths of Pompeii , Rome, L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1995. p. 13 The entrance to the bathhouse is through a long corridor that leads into the apodyterium. The bathers would also have had access to a latrine, seating between six and eight people. Only one apodyterium has led to speculation by archaeologists that both men and women shared this facility, or that it was male-only or time- shared. The apodyterium contains the erotic wall paintings.  Erotic art in the Suburban Baths  The erotic wall paintings in the Suburban Baths are the only set of such art found in a public Roman bath house. Explicit sex scenes (such as group sex and oral sex) are depicted in these paintings that cannot be easily found in collections of erotic Roman art. As the sexual acts portrayed are all considered \\"debased\\" according to the customs of ancient Rome, it is possible that the intention behind their reproduction was to provide a source of humour to visitors of the building. The paintings are located in the apodyterium and each scene is located above a numbered box. These boxes are thought to have functioned as lockers in which bathers put their clothes. It is speculated that the paintings possibly served as way for the bathers to remember the location of their box (in lieu of numbering). The presence of these paintings in a public bathhouse shared by men and women gives some insight into Roman culture and suggests that people would not have found this offensive, and possibly humorous. The images are as follows: * two images showing generic male-female coital scenes * woman performing fellatio on a man * man performing cunnilingus on a woman * one lesbian duo with a phallus-shaped sexual aid or dildo * one threesome * one foursome * naked man with deformed, huge testicles Image:Sexual scene on pompeian mural 2.jpgFresco from the Suburban baths of a 2 male and 1 female threesome.

Mountain Lodge Park is in the Town of Blooming Grove in Orange County, New York, United States. It is built on the western slope of Schunemunk Mountain, the highest in the county. Historically Mountain Lodge Park was a community of summer homes but over the years it has gradually been transformed to mostly full year residences. There are approximately 800 homes that are split between the two 'sides'. One side is considered the Mountain Lodge Park side and the other side is called Glenwood Hills. Mountain Lodge Park was developed with some fits and starts just before and then after World War Two. Glenwood Hills was developed in the 1950s with building continuing into the 1970s. During the Carter Administration the community was offered an opportunity to pave all roads and install municipal water and sewage lines while it was being rebuilt after a terrible storm. The residents in the area turned down the offer as it would have increased taxes on homes that were unoccupied for most of the year. Generally on the Mountain Lodge Park side the houses are further apart but most of the roads (trails) are unpaved. On the Glenwood Hills side most of the houses are closer together but the roads are paved. From the 1960s through the 1980s the community featured a volunteer fire department, a general store, a seasonal municipal water supply, two neighboring horseback riding academies, a large pool area, a synagogue, and a multi-purpose meeting house.

Production Following the decision of the producers not to use Monty Norman, though keeping his \\"James Bond Theme\\", Harry Saltzman decided on using the then popular Lionel Bart of Oliver! fame. Bart was unable to read or write music, but he offered to compose the music and lyrics for a title song to the film. The producers chose John Barry to score the film. Barry had not only arranged and conducted the \\"James Bond Theme\\" from the previous film, but had already scored some films such as Beat Girl and Never Let Go. Barry's group also charted at 13 in the November 1962 UK charts with a different arrangement of the Bond theme from that heard in the film.p.282 Thompson, Gordon Please Please Me: Sixties British Pop Inside Out 2008 Oxford University Press The title song was sung by Matt Monro. Monro's vocal version is played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles. The title credit music is a lively instrumental version of the tune preceded by a brief Barry-composed \\"James Bond Is Back\\" then segueing into the \\"James Bond Theme\\". On the original film soundtrack, Alan Haven played a jazzy organ over the theme but this version was not released on the soundtrack album. The tune also appears in a soft string arrangement as a theme for Tania. In Germany, the original release featured an end title track cover version called Die Wolga ist Weit sung by Ruthe Berl√©. Originally planning to use local Turkish music as Norman had used Jamaican music on Dr No, Barry accompanied the film crew to Istanbul, however he found nothing suitable for the film.p.36 Smith, Jim & Lavington, Steven Bond Films 2002 Virgiin Books Recalling his visit to Istanbul, John Barry said, \\"It was like no place I'd ever been in my life. [The Trip] was supposedly to seep up the music, so Noel Rogers and I used to go 'round to these nightclubs and listen to all this stuff. We had the strangest week, and really came away with nothing, except a lot of ridiculous stories. We went back, talked to Lionel, and then he wrote 'From Russia with Love. Album and cover versions The soundtrack's original recordings are thought to be lost and did not appear when the Bond soundtrack albums were issued in remastered form on CD. The album is different from the film with the album's recording of the main titles sounding slower and not featuring the organ played by Alan Haven. Several tracks on the album do not appear in the completed film. The album was the last of the Bond soundtrack albums to feature more than the usual six tracks per record side. The soundtrack album reached 28 on the Variety charts in March 1964 with the title song becoming Unart Music's most recorded song.p.125 Lindner, Christop The James Bond Phenonomon: A Critical Reader 2004 Manchester University Press Other cover versions of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" were also released to coincide with the film. Barry also released different cover versions of the title song and \\"007\\" on his Ember records for the pop charts. The Roland Shaw Orchestra performed cover versions of most of the music of Barry's soundtrack on several albums.

Fujio in 1977 and serialized in Sh≈çnen Big Comic. It was later adapted into an anime series in 1987 and an anime film in 1988. This series has a similar premise to one of Fujiko F. Fujio's earlier shorts titled Akage no Anko (\\"Redheaded Anko\\"), later retitled Anko ≈åi ni Okoru (\\"When Anko Really Gets Angry\\"), which is about Anko Aoyama, a teenage girl who discovers her psychic powers and the dark secret of her mother's lineage of true witches, and who also poses nude for her own father. Plot Mami Sakura used to be a normal junior high school student, but she happened to acquire supernatural powers. Using her powers and with the help of her childhood friend, Kazuo Takahata, she solves mysterious occurrences. When she senses someone needs help, she uses the \\"Teleportation Gun\\" (a heart-shaped brooch Takahata designs) and transports herself there. She then saves people in trouble with her psychic powers, such as telekinesis and telepathy. Character ; (voiced by Keiko Yokozawa) :The chief character. A student of Tobita Junior High School in \\"the Sama hill\\", in the suburbs of Tokyo. Her powers are awakened by an unexpected coincidence and she uses the power for acts of kindness afterward. She is bright, but careless and rather meddlesome. Mami isn't very good at studying or housework, especially cooking, which becomes a recurring joke throughout the series. Her father is an artist, and Mami usually poses as a nude model for his painting in exchange for more allowances. She was going to reveal her supernatural power to her father, but her friend Kazuo told her that her French ancestors were hunted as witches, and refrains from telling him. She is sometimes called \\"Mami-k≈ç\\" by her father (with ÂÖ¨ k≈ç, literally \\"duke\\" or \\"European sovereign prince\\", being used in a disdainful way). Mami has a red hair. She wears a white shirt with a sailor neckerchief, a light blue scarf, blue skirt, white socks and black shoes. When Mami prepared to fly in the sky every night, she wears a white shirt with short sleeves, blue dress, white socks and black shoes. Mami's main power is telekinesis. She also possesses a levitation ability (she can float not only herself but several objects at the same time), telepathy and teleportation, although, she often collides with objects and other people. Takahata created a teleportation gun, so that Mami can control her teleportation. ; (voiced by Hiroyuki Shibamoto) :A student of Tobita Junior High School and Mami's best friend. He originally thought Mami's supernatural powers are his, which upset him greatly when he found the truth but later supports Mami in developing her powers. He is a real genius, helping Mami understand her powers and develop them. Although he really likes amateur baseball, he is awful at it, which make Mami sometimes secretly interfere to help his team. He often comes up with alibis for Mami whenever she gets in trouble with her parents. He has a good understanding of Mami, and often supports her. ; (voiced by Akari Hibino) :A dog which looks more like a raccoon dog or fox, and Mami's pet. He loves fried bean curd, and often cries \\"Fyan Fyan\\". Mary, the neighbor's dog, likes him. He understood human words and always got offended if being mistaken for a fox/raccoon dog (a trait shared by another Fujiko F. Fujio character, Doraemon the robot cat). Originally he hates Kazuo because he often accidentally sing songs about raccoon dogs but later becomes friend when Kazuo saved Mami from a collapsed tunnel. ; (voiced by Hiroshi Masuoka) :Mami's father and a painter. He often holds private exhibitions (but the pictures don't sell very well) and also works as art lecturer in a municipal senior high school. He is a laid back, clumsy person who enjoys pickled radish and smoking pipe. His grandfather married a French painter, whose lineage is believed to be the source of Mami's powers. He made an evacuation of schoolchildren in Yamanashi during the war. Because his father was affiliated with Europe and America, he was often bullied in his youth. He calls his daughter \\"Mami-k≈ç\\" (Mami duke). He has a younger brother named Hyakuro, and Ichiro, an older brother in the country. ; (voiced by Yoshiko Sakakibara) :Mami's mother.

She is the calmest of the group. She seems to be Takenaga's girlfriend. ; (voiced by Yoku Shioya) :The delinquent. Mami's powers first surfaced when his group attacked Takabata. Mami's powers once temporarily shifted to him by accident. ; (voiced by Yoshikazu Hirano) :Mami's classmate. Wears glasses and is a classic music enthusiast. ; (voiced by Hirotaka Suzuoki) :Director of the movie club at Tobita Junior High School. He planned to do a movie called \\"Transparent Dracula\\", featuring a character like Mami, but he wanted a nude scene of the character. ; (voiced by Nobuo Tobita) :Vice Director of the Tobita movie club. He was engaged in film photography when he spotted manipulation had been added to the picture (by Mami). He began to believe that Mami was an esper, and started following her around. His father is a director of a first-class business company. ; (voiced by Hiromi Tsuru) :A childhood friend of Takahata. She calls Takabata \\"Kazuo\\" and is called \\"the wonder\\" from Takahata. She is in her early twenties, and usually rides a motorcycle. She likes disco and liquor. Media =Anime= The animated adaptation of the series aired in Japan from April 7, 1987 to October 26, 1989, with 119 episodes and a TV special being broadcast. Four pieces of theme music were used for it: two opening themes and two ending themes. The first opening theme is by Hashimoto Ushio, which was used for episodes 1‚Äì107, and the TV special. The second opening theme is \\"S„ÉªO„ÉªS\\" by Hashimoto Ushio and SHINES, which was used for episodes 108‚Äì119. The first ending theme is by Hashimoto Ushio, which was used for episodes 28-107. The second ending theme is by Hashimoto Ushio, which was used for episodes 108‚Äì119. Episodes 1-27 did not have an ending theme because they were aired as part of a block of other Fujiko F. Fujio anime, which had its own ending theme for the entire block. One insert song was also featured in episode 30, entitled by Junichiro Oda, and was originally composed as an image song based on the popular 1987 Sh≈çjo manga series, \\"Nanairo Magic\\" by Y≈´ Asagiri. The series was not available on home video in any form until 2003, in which 12 of the 119 episodes were released on 6 VHS cassette tapes„ÄÅ(each tape having two episodes). The \\"Dancing Dolls in the Starlit Sky\\" short film, which had originally premiered in Japanese theaters on March 12, 1988 as a pre-movie bonus before Doraemon: The Record of Nobita's Parallel Visit to the West, was also released on a 2003 VHS cassette tape with the \\"Pro Golfer Saru\\" short film. These VHS tapes were marked only for use in rental video shops in Japan, and could not be sold in stores. The complete TV series was first released as individual rental-only DVDs in October 2007, and as retail DVDs for purchase beginning on December 20, 2007. The retail DVDs were released in two box sets, the first of which contained episodes 1-60, and the second containing episodes 61-119 and \\"My Angel, Mami-chan\\", the main story from the TV special that originally aired on December 27, 1988. However, due to manufacturing issues, the next episode previews that originally followed each episode were left off of the first box set. In order to make up for their error, the publisher of the DVDs included a mail-in form in which those who bought both box sets could send in proof of purchases for them and receive a \\"ESPer Mami Special DVD\\" that contained the next episode previews for all 119 episodes, along with the unaired pilot film for the series, creditless opening and ending theme songs, promotional videos used to promote the series prior to it first premiering, and the animated interstitials for the TV special that were edited out of the main DVDs. Due to the many problems with the two original DVD releases, the animated series was re-released as a single 21-disc \\"Anniversary DVD Box\\" on October 29, 2014. This new anniversary set was released with the same material as the two previous 10-disc box sets and the Special DVD, except that the previews for episodes 1-60 were included at the end of each episode, and the space that was used for the previews on the Special 21st disc was replaced with the \\"Dancing Dolls in the Starlit Sky\\" animated movie that had not previously been released on DVD. In May 2018, it was announced that the Yahoo! Japan had picked up the rights to stream a new digitally remastered 1080p HD version of the ESPer Mami series on their \\"GYAO!\\" online video streaming service. As it is a remaster, this version does not have the faded colors and mis-coloring that had been present on the DVD versions. GYAO! began streaming the remastered series for free on May 22, 2018, with one new episode being added to the service each day, and each episode being available for viewing for 14 days after it first appeared on the website, after which it was removed.

Formerly part of the Ferguson Highway, the route was designated with its own number in 1953, prior to which it formed a part of Highway 11\\\\. It travels east of the current Highway 11, around Round Lake and through Dane before ending at Highway 66 southwest of Kirkland Lake.  Route description  Highway 112 begins in the south at Highway 11, south of Tarzwell, north of which it passes along the eastern shoreline of Round Lake. Travelling alongside but out of site of a railway line, the highway continues north to Dame, meeting the eastern terminus of Secondary Highway 650\\\\. The route winds north, crossing the railway line before ending at Highway 66, part of the Trans-Canada Highway, between Swastika and Chaput Hughes, southwest of the primary urban area of Kirkland Lake. The route is long, and is situated entirely within Timiskaming District. Like other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 112 is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 2010, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry showed that on average, 1,950 vehicles used the highway daily along the section between Dane and Highway 66, while 1,350 vehicles did so each day along the remainder of the route, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.  History  Highway 112 travels along the Ferguson Highway, the original alignment of Highway 11, until the Round Lake Diversion was constructed and Highway 11 rerouted onto it. The Ferguson Highway, mostly gravelled, was built north from New Liskeard to Cochrane via Earlton, Englehart, Dane, Swastika, Matheson, Monteith and Porquis Junction beginning in late 1923; it was complete by 1925. During the early 1950s, the Round Lake Diversion was constructed, bypassing the original route of Highway 11 from south of Tarzwell to the present day junction with Highway 66\\\\.

It is further notorious for the massacre mainly of its Muslim plus Jewish population (the Massacre of Tripolitsa), which occurred after the city's fall to the Greek revolutionary forces. As historian of the war W. Alison Phillips noted, \\"the other atrocities of Greeks paled before the awful scenes which followed the storming of Tripolitza\\".Phillips, p. 59. Background Situated in the middle of Peloponnese, Tripolitsa was the pre- eminent town in southern Greece, as well as the administrative centre for Ottoman rule in the Peloponnese, thus making it an important target for the Greek revolutionaries. Many rich Turks and Jews lived there, together with Ottoman refugees, such as Turks and Albanians from Vardounia (ŒíŒ±œÅŒ¥ŒøœçŒΩŒπŒ±) driven there by the outbreak of the revolt, escaping massacres in the country's southern districts.St. Clair, p. 45. It was also a potent symbol for revenge, its Greek population having been massacred by the Ottoman forces in the past: the latest of such events, a few months earlier, following the failed rebellion at Moldavia in early 1821; previous massacres of the town's Greeks occurred in 1715 (during the Ottoman reconquest of the Morea) and on Holy Monday, 29 March 1770, after the failed Orlov Revolt.Nafziger, George F. and Mark W. Walton, Islam at war: a history, (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003), 76.Brewer David, The Greek War of Independence. The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression and the Birth of the Modern Greek Nation, The Overlook Press, New York, (2001), pp. 111‚Äì112 ().Brunet de Presle et Alexandre Blanchet, Gr√®ce depuis la conqu√™te romaine jusqu'√† nos jours, Firmin Didot (1860) pp. 387‚Äì388 The de facto commander in chief of the Greek forces, Theodoros Kolokotronis, now focused on the capital of the province. He set up fortified camps in the surrounding places, establishing several headquarters under the command of his captain Anagnostaras in the nearby villages, notably Zarachova, Piana, Dimitsana and Stemnitsa, where local peasants provided his men with food and supplies.Kolokotronis, p. 82. In addition, a fresh and compact force of Maniot troops under Petros Mavromichalis, the Bey of Mani, arrived and camped at Valtetsi so as to take part in the final assault to the Ottoman capital of Morea.Stratiki, p. 83. Arvanites were present alongside Greek revolutionaries during the siege, in fighting and the massacre that followed. Other commanders present at the siege were Bouboulina, Panagiotis Rodios, Olivier Voutier, Maxime Raybaud as chief of the artillery, Kanellos Deligiannis and Demetrios Ypsilantis (left before the city was taken). The Ottoman (Turkish and Albanian) garrison was reinforced in May by some troops and cavalry sent by Hursid Pasha from the north, led by the Kehayabey Mustafa. The rebels' decisive victory in the Battle of Valtetsi and several other victorious clashes such as those in Doliana and Vervena, meant that the Greek revolutionaries had effective control over the majority of the areas in the Central and Southern Peloponnese. Siege Although the siege had been going on for several months, its progress was slow, as the Greeks were unable to maintain a tight blockade and were often scattered by sorties of Turkish cavalry.St. Clair, p. 43. While during the early stages of the siege, the Ottoman garrison could sortie and forage for supplies, after the Battle of the Trench in August this was no longer possible, and the blockade became much more tight. Conditions were worsening inside the walls for scarcity of food and potable water. Taking advantage of this, Kolokotronis began quiet negotiations with the leaders of the besieged, aiming at an orderly capitulation. He wisely convinced the Albanian contingent led by Elmas BeyFinlay, p. 266 to make a separate agreement for safe passage to Argos, thereby greatly reducing the strength of the defenders. The deal itself was guaranteed by Dimitrios Plapoutas, the renowned Koliopoulos. The city was taken before the 2,500 Albanian had departed, but still they had a safe passage out of the Peloponnese a few days after the fall.Kolokotronis, p. 89. Greek leaders were in constant contact with the Ottoman defenders in negotiations, but without much coordination. The successive petitions of the remaining Ottoman defenders for a truce were, in the end, regarded by the besiegers as a temporizing ruse, in an ultimately hopeless anticipation of Ottoman reinforcements. In anticipation of the fall of the city, by September 22, about 20,000 Greeks had gathered around it. On September 23, the Greek army broke in through a blind spot in the walls, and the town was completely overrun quickly.Stratiki, pp. 84‚Äì86. The fortified citadel in it surrendered three days later for lack of water.Finlay, p. 268.

The detachments of Kolokotronis' division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \\"O\\". In the three days following the capture of the city, Muslims (Turks and other Muslims) alongside Jewish and Christians supporters of the Ottoman regime, inhabitants of Tripolitsa, were exterminated.Andromedas, John N. (1976). \\"Maniot folk culture and the ethnic mosaic in the southeast Peloponnese\\". Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. 268. (1): 200. \\"In 1821, then, the ethnic mosaic of the southeastern Peloponnese (the ancient Laconia and Cynouria) consisted of Christian Tsakonians and Albanians on the east, Christian Maniats and Barduniotes, and Moslem Albanian Barduniotes in the southwest, and an ordinary Greek Christian population running between them. In 1821, with a general Greek uprising impending, rumors of a \\"Russo- Frankish\\" naval bombardment caused the \\"Turkish\\" population of the southeastern Peloponnese to seek refuge in the fortresses of Monevasia, Mystra, and Tripolitza. Indeed, the Turkobarduniotes were so panic stricken that they stampeded the Moslems of Mystra along with them into headlong flight to Tripolitza. The origin of this rumor was the firing of a salute by a sea captain named Frangias in honor of a Maniat leader known as \\"the Russian Knight.\\" Some Moslems in Bardunia, and elsewhere, remained as converts to Christianity. Thus almost overnight the whole of the southeastern Peloponnese was cleared of \\"Turks\\" of whatever linguistic affiliation. This situation was sealed by the ultimate success of the Greek War for Independence. The Christian Albanians, identifying with their Orthodox coreligionists and with the new nationstate, gradually gave up the Albanian language, in some instances deliberately deciding not to pass it on to their children.\\"Heraclides, Alexis (2011).

The London School of Economics and Political Science. p. 15. \\"On the Greek side, a case in point is the atrocious onslaught of the Greeks and Hellenised Christian Albanians against the city of Tripolitza in October 1821, which is justified by the Greeks ever since as the almost natural and predictable outcome of more than '400 years of slavery and dudgeon'. All the other similar atrocious acts all over Peloponnese, where apparently the whole population of Muslims (Albanian and Turkish-speakers), well over twenty thousand vanished from the face of the earth within a spat of a few months in 1821 is unsaid and forgotten, a case of ethnic cleansing through sheer slaughter (St Clair 2008: 1‚Äì9, 41‚Äì46) as are the atrocities committed in Moldavia (were the \\"Greek Revolution\\" actually started in February 1821) by prince Ypsilantis.\\" The total number of Muslims killed during the sack was estimated by Thomas Gordon, who arrived in the city shortly after its fall, at 8,000.Finlay, p. 269. Beyond the 2,500 Albanian troops vouched for in advance; a tiny contingent of Turkish cavalry escaping to Nauplion; a few women who were taken as slaves; along with the harem of Hurshid Pasha; and a few notable Turks held for ransom were spared.Finlay, p. 269 Describing the massacres that occurred following the capture of Tripolitsa, historian W. Alison Phillips noted that: > For three days the miserable inhabitants were given over to lust and cruelty > of a mob of savages. Neither sex nor age was spared. Women and children were > tortured before being put to death. So great was the slaughter that > Kolokotronis himself says that, from the gate to the citadel his horse's > hoofs never touched the ground. His path of triumph was carpeted with > corpses. At the end of two days, the wretched remnant of the Mussulmans were > deliberately collected, to the number of some two thousand souls, of every > age and sex, but principally women and children, were led out to a ravine in > the neighboring mountains and there butchered like cattle.Phillips (1897), > p. 61 Kolokotronis says in his memoirs:Kolokotronis (Edmonds) pp. 156‚Äì159. > Inside the town they had begun to massacre. ... I rushed to the palace ... > If you wish to hurt these Albanians, I cried, \\"kill me rather; for, while I > am a living man, whoever first makes the attempt, him will I kill the > first.\\" ... I was faithful to my word of honor ... Tripolitsa was three > miles in circumference. The [Greek] host which entered it, cut down and were > slaying men, women, and children from Friday till Sunday. Thirty-two > thousand were reported to have been slain. One Hydriote [boasted that he > had] killed ninety. About a hundred Greeks were killed; but the end came > [thus]: a proclamation was issued that the slaughter must cease. ... When I > entered Tripolitsa, they showed me a plane tree in the market-place where > the Greeks had always been hung. I sighed. \\"Alas!\\" I said, \\"how many of my > own clan ‚Äî of my own race ‚Äî have been hung there!\\" And I ordered it to be > cut down. I felt some consolation then from the slaughter of the Turks. ... > [Before the fall] we had formed a plan of proposing to the Turks that they > should deliver Tripolitsa into our hands, and that we should, in that case, > send persons into it to gather the spoils together, which were then to be > apportioned and divided among the different districts for the benefit of the > nation; but who would listen? There were about one hundred foreign officers present at the scenes of atrocities and looting committed in Tripolitsa, Friday to Sunday. Based upon eyewitness accounts and descriptions provided by these officers, William St. Clair wrote: > Upwards of ten thousand Turks were put to death. Prisoners who were > suspected of having concealed their money were tortured. Their arms and legs > were cut off and they were slowly roasted over fires. Pregnant women were > cut open, their heads cut off, and dogs' heads stuck between their legs. > From Friday to Sunday the air was filled with the sound of screams...

Historians estimate that upwards of twenty thousand Muslim men, women and children were killed during this time, often with the exhortation of the local clergy.William St. Clair (1972) p. 12Finlay, p. 172Phillips (1897), pp. 57‚Äì61 Steven Bowman believes that, although the Jews were murdered, they were not targeted specifically, in fact: \\"Such a tragedy seems to be more a side- effect of the butchering of the Turks of Tripolis, the last Ottoman stronghold in the South where the Jews had taken refuge from the fighting, than a specific action against Jews per se.\\"Bowman, Steven, \\"History of the Jews in Greece\\". University of Massachusetts According to memoirist Fotakos (Fotis Chrysanthopoulos), two Jewish families (Hanam and Levi) were rescued by Kolokotronis.Œó Œ¨ŒªœâœÉŒ∑ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ§œÅŒπœÄŒøŒªŒπœÑœÉŒ¨œÇ During the siege, eight Greek Orthodox prelates of Peloponnese were incarcerated inside the city, and five of them died before the fall. Aftermath The capture of the city of Tripolis had a salutary effect in the morale of the revolutionaries. After this event, Greeks saw that their way towards victory was possible, they secured c.11,000 arms, with the entire Peloponnese bearing hardly any trace of Ottomans anymore. On the other hand, it also marked the first strong point of discord in a previously apparently cohesive force, since the atrocities committed during the siege were at the time strongly decried and criticized by some Phanariote figures of the Greek War of Independence such as Dimitrios Ypsilantis and Alexandros Mavrokordatos.Diamantouros, pp. 224‚Äì228. The residual bitterness over the ultimate disposition of the spoils,Finlay pp. 267‚Äì271. along with generalized anarchy following the fall of the city, emphasized the divergent perspectives between the Peloponessian chieftains (military faction) and the intellectual mentors of the uprising (political faction). In time, these would develop into an internal conflict, and, later on, civil wars, within the same struggle for independence.

During the First World War he served as a pilot in the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force. Early life and rowing career Thomson was born in Battersea, Surrey, the second of four children of Benjamin Thomas Lindsay Thomson and his wife Esther Florence (n√©e Bowker). He was educated at University College School in Hampstead and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Thomson partnered John Fenning at stroke in the coxless pairs to win the gold medal for Great Britain rowing at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Later in the same afternoon he and Fenning were in the Leander coxless four with Philip Filleul and Harold Barker which won a silver medal, losing to the Magdalen College, Oxford crew. In 1909, Thomson was a member of the Cambridge crew in the Boat Race, and won his rowing blue. In 1910, he won Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta partnering John Burn to beat Albertus Wielsma and Bernardus Croon. He was also a rugby player who played for UCS Old Boys, London Scottish and Surrey. World War I At the outbreak of World War I Thomson learned to fly, being granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 873 on 20 August 1914 after soloing a Bristol biplane at the Bristol School at Brooklands. He joined the Royal Naval Air Service as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant on 24 August, and was confirmed in his rank on 30 October, and posted to HMS Pembroke III. On 1 January 1915 he was promoted to flight lieutenant, seeing active service during the Gallipoli Campaign between April 1915 and January 1916, and on 14 March 1916 received a mention in despatches from the Vice-Admiral Commanding the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron, and also the award of the Distinguished Service Cross for his low altitude photographic reconnaissance flights over enemy territory. On 30 June 1916 he was promoted to flight commander, and a year later, on 30 June 1917, to squadron commander. On 1 May 1918 Thomson was again mentioned in despatches \\"for zeal and devotion to duty during the period from 1 July to 31 December 1917\\". On 1 April 1918, Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to form the Royal Air Force, and Thomson joined the new service with the rank of captain (temporary major). (The RAF initially used the army ranks inherited from the RFC). Soon after, the former No. 7 Squadron RNAS, now No. 207 Squadron RAF, was withdrawn from France to be re-equipped with the Handley Page O/400 heavy bomber at RAF Andover. On 24 May 1918 Thomson was appointed commander of No. 207 Squadron which returned to France on 7 June to be based at Ligescourt as part of No. 54 Wing of the Independent Air Force, to mount night-bombing operations. However his tenure was short as Thomson was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel on 27 July, and transferred to command of No. 215 Squadron RAF. On 2 August 1918 Thomson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. His citation read: :Captain (Temporary Major) Gordon Lindsay Thomson, DSC. ::\\"This officer has carried out 340 hours flying, and has taken part in fourteen bombing raids. In one of the latter he led his formation to destroy a bridge over a canal; he flew at a considerable altitude over the objective, watching each machine drop its bombs, and endeavoured to observe the results. After all his machines had completed the raid and departed for the lines, he glided down and passed over the bridge at 140 feet altitude. In face of very severe machine-gun fire he crossed and re-crossed the objective in order to ascertain the results obtained. No material damage being apparent, he flew across it again at 100 feet altitude, dropping his bombs in a final attempt to destroy the bridge. He is a fine leader, and the excellent spirit in his squadron is largely due to his personal example.\\" Thomson left the RAF after the end of the war, being transferred to the unemployed list on 1 March 1919. On 19 July 1919 Thomson and his brother Captain Alexander Thomson were two of the ex- servicemen of the parish who were presented with silver-mounted walking sticks in recognition of their military service from the Parish Council of Effingham, where their father was a parish councillor, as part of the Peace Day celebrations marking the signing of the Treaty of Versailles which brought the war to an end. Thomson died at Staplehurst, Kent, at the age of 69.

Childhood and pre- career  Drury was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and was reared with his two brothers, Chad and Jesse, in Rapid City, South Dakota. In 2001, he graduated with a business degree from Southwestern Oklahoma State University in Weatherford, Oklahoma.  Career  Drury was on the Southwestern Oklahoma State University rodeo team that, in 1999, won the national championship. Drury made the trip in 2000 to Las Vegas, as a contestant in the National Finals Rodeo (NFR), and won a national ranking of 10th place. He won the Reno Rodeo championship in 2001, which set an arena record. Drury started experiencing back pain (as a result of the cancer that would claim his life) later that year, but he fought through it, and he almost qualified for the NFR again, finishing 19th in the national rankings for the year.  Cancer and death  Drury was diagnosed on May 5, 2002, with Ewing's sarcoma, a rare type of cancer found most commonly in teenagers. He was treated at the Denver Children's Hospital. Following chemotherapy treatments, a tumor was found and removed in his chest cavity. The cancer went away for a year, and Drury judged rodeos while recuperating. However, the cancer came back twice more in the next two years. He ultimately died on October 31, 2006, at the age of 27.

Starmaker's major distributions were films from the then-recently out-of-business New World Pictures and programs previously licensed to their video division. Viacom programs and Saturday Night Live compilations were other notable Starmaker releases. The companies competed with each other for years, until they were sold to the Handleman Company, and formed a new corporate umbrella: Anchor Bay Entertainment, in May 1995.Billboard (May 20, 1995), page 84-85. The company also bought out (through the Video Treasures and Starmaker acquisitions) other budget home video and music distributors such as MNTEX Entertainment, Teal Entertainment, Burbank Video, Drive Entertainment, and GTS Records. Both the Video Treasures and Starmaker labels were phased out a few years later. Original company logo from 1995 until 2008.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Anchor Bay specialized in the release of horror films, particularly cult films and slasher movies from the 1970s and 1980s. One of its first releases was Prom Night in 1980. It also released Halloween (as well as its 3rd, 4th, and 5th sequels), Hellraiser, and many others, leading the home video market for obscure and retro horror films. In October 2000, Anchor Bay Entertainment opened up operations in the United Kingdom. Anchor Bay remained part of Handleman until 2003, when it was acquired by IDT Entertainment. On February 4, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against two former employees of Anchor Bay Entertainment, a former subsidiary of Handleman Company. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that the two employees caused the company to enter into a 2 million-dollar fraudulent transactions. The transactions involved the purported sale of slow-moving or obsolete inventory to business partners coupled with secret buy-back provisions. The inventory included worthless video boxes and sleeves and DVDs for films. Handleman subsequently restated its financial statements to correct these accounting errors. Liberty Media, the owner of the Starz cable network, purchased IDT Entertainment from IDT Corporation in 2006 and renamed it Starz Media. In May 2007, Anchor Bay became known as Starz Home Entertainment (SHE). SHE announced on June 19, 2007, that it will be releasing high-definition versions of its films exclusively in the Blu-ray format. In 2008, Starz Media reinstated the Anchor Bay Entertainment brand, and all current releases bear this name. Many of the company's past cult titles have gone out of print, although some have been reissued by Blue Underground. SPHE had a three-year deal with Starz's Anchor Bay Entertainment for worldwide DVD releases, with the exceptions of North America, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. On January 4, 2011, Starz, LLC sold 25% of Starz Media to The Weinstein Company, which rendered Anchor Bay the de facto video distributor of films made by TWC and Dimension. Starz later bought back the Weinstein's stake in October 2015, with Anchor Bay continuing to release TWC and Dimension video releases. In early 2015, Anchor Bay UK (alongside Manga Entertainment UK) was bought from Starz by managing director Colin Lomax and renamed to Platform Entertainment. Kaleidoscope Film Distribution would acquire Platform in December 2016, with Manga Entertainment UK becoming an separate entity and operating on its own, which itself was eventually acquired by Funimation in 2019. On June 30, 2016, Lionsgate agreed to acquire Anchor Bay's parent company Starz Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash and stock. The Starz/Lionsgate merger was completed on December 8, 2016. Afterwards, Lionsgate folded Anchor Bay into Lionsgate's home entertainment division. As of 2019, Anchor Bay's website remains online, but with all the links broken.

The company's first-ever release on DVD was The Car in April 1997, followed by Elvira, Mistress of the Dark that August, and a director's cut of Dawn of the Dead in November 1997. The company's next release was Prom Night in February 1998.Catalogue listings state that Prom Night was released by Anchor Bay on February 18, 1998. It also released Halloween (as well as its 3rd and 4th sequels), Sleepaway Camp, Alice, Sweet Alice, The Hills Have Eyes, Suspiria, Maniac, the first 3 Hellraiser films, The Wicker Man, Silent Night, Deadly Night, Children of the Corn, The Beyond and several other Lucio Fulci films. Some of these titles were given numbered limited edition releases which included multiple discs, information booklets, and collectible tin cases. Many of these releases went out of print and became sought-after collectibles. Anchor Bay Entertainment is also noted for the release of the Evil Dead film trilogy on DVD, in numerous editions. Army of Darkness for example, had been released in both a regular and limited edition set that featured the director's cut of the film. Since then, the director's cut has been re- released on 2 separate occasions in addition to a 2-disc \\"Boomstick Edition\\" of the film as well. Until Anchor Bay released The Evil Dead on VHS and DVD, it was previously unavailable on video from a major label. Also among its more profitable releases has been George A. Romero's Living Dead series. Anchor Bay Entertainment has distribution rights for the middle 2 films in the Romero tetralogy: Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, however, it has also distributed DVDs of the original film, Night of the Living Dead, which is in the public domain. Like the Evil Dead trilogy, the \\"Living Dead\\" series has seen many editions of the films on DVD. Dawn of the Dead has itself seen several releases on DVD, the most extra feature-laden being the Ultimate Edition in late 2004. An \\"Evil Dead\\" 3-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD was released in December 2007. =Special interest= In addition to feature films, Anchor Bay Entertainment distributed special interest titles, including children's video series, like Bobby's World and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Until 2008, they distributed Thomas & Friends videos. Thomas has reached platinum-selling status and in 2004 ranks consistently on the VideoScan ranking top 50 chart of children's weekly video sales. Lionsgate acquired the Thomas DVD titles after HIT Entertainment bought out the rights to Thomas. Rights to the Thomas DVDs now belong to Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (through their deal with Mattel, HIT's current parent company). The company also has a top market share for fitness videos such as the Crunch and For Dummies series. The company also distributes Ultimate Fighting Championship events on DVD and Blu-ray. =Production company= As a full-fledged production company, they handle television syndication of Halloween, Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael Myers (which they also hold the video rights to), and have recently entered in-house production and distribution of theatrical films. Award Anchor Bay Entertainment received a Special Achievement Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films in June 2002. Anchor Bay was recognized as one of the \\"pioneers in DVD releases and home video entertainment\\" and \\"successful in releasing dramas, comedies, foreign films, children's programming, and most prominently genre films.\\" Cited as highlights of Anchor Bay's releases were \\"the films of Hammer Studios, the works of Werner Herzog, Paul Verhoeven, Wim Wenders, John Woo, Monte Hellman and Sam Raimi\\".

Biography McCulloch was born at Melbourne, Australia, the son of George McCulloch. His father, who was born in Scotland, made his fortune at Broken Hill in Australia and returned with his family to Britain about 1891 and set up home at 184 Queens Gate, London (demolished 1971). McCulloch attended Winchester College where he was a member of the Winchester College Boating Club (WCBC) and developed a keen interest and proficiency in rowing. He then went to University College Oxford. In 1907 he competed in, and was runner up to Captain Darell in the Diamond Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta. In 1908 he rowed for Oxford in the University Boat Race against Cambridge. Also in 1908, McCulloch, as a member of the Leander Club won the Diamond Sculls at Henley, beating Athol Alexander Stuart.Henley Royal Regatta Results of Final Races 1839‚Äì1939 McCulloch was subsequently selected for the British Team and won the Silver Medal in the single sculls, rowing at the 1908 Summer Olympics. The winner of the Gold Medal was Harry Blackstaffe of the Vesta Rowing Club who was twice McCulloch's age at the time and something of a sculling legend. The final was considered the finest race of the Olympic Regatta and was virtually level until the last 50 yards when Blackstaffe held on to a light advantage to become the oldest sculling champion in Olympic history Victory falling to the home crew in the Sculls, Pairs and Fours, Great Britain could claim a success in every event of the Olympic Regatta of 1908. McCulloch competed in the Diamond Challenge Sculls again in 1912, when he was runner up to Eric Powell. In later life McCulloch was one of the coaches of Jack Wilson and Ran Laurie.Private communication, the McCulloch family 22 February 2010. McCulloch died in England at the age of 63. Portrait by John Singer Sargent George McCulloch was an avid art collector and bought works by many pre-eminent pre-raphaelites and impressionists. Alexander McCulloch was himself the subject of a portrait called \\"On His Holidays... Norway\\" painted in 1901/1902 by John Singer Sargent. At the time the McCullochs, accompanied by John Singer Sargent, were on a salmon fishing holiday in Norway. John Singer Sargent originally painted Alexander in a standing position holding a landing net but decided the portrait looked too contrived. John Singer Sargent turned the canvas on its side and painted directly on top of the original portrait. Alexander is now portrayed laying his side at the side of a river in a more natural and relaxed pose. At the time of the portrait Alexander was a pupil at Winchester College, a Public School, and in the portrait the school tie can be seen serving as a belt for his trousers. The painting is now on display at the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Merseyside, England. It was acquired by Lord Leverhulme, along with several other paintings, shortly after the death of George McCulloch. Lord Leverhulme, who regarded \\"On His Holidays...Norway\\" as his favourite painting, had for a long time tried to have his own portrait painted by John Singer Sargent but without success.

He was co-editor of the well-known book series CHORA: Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture vol. 1-7 (McGill-Queen's University Press) together with Stephen Parcell, which collects essays exploring fundamental questions concerning the practice of architecture through its history and theories. He co-authored a major book with Louise Pelletier, Architectural Representation and the Perspective Hinge (MIT Press, 1997), tracing the history and theory of modern European architectural representation, with special reference to the role of projection in architectural design. In Built Upon Love: Architectural Longing after Ethics and Aesthetics (MIT Press, 2006), P√©rez-G√≥mez examines points of convergence between ethics and poetics in architectural history and philosophy, and draws important conclusions for contemporary practice. His most recent title, Attunement, Architectural Meaning after the Crisis of Modern Science (MIT Press, 2016) calls for an architecture that can enhance our human values and capacities, an architecture that is connected‚Äîattuned‚Äîto its location and its inhabitants. Architecture, P√©rez-G√≥mez explains, operates as a communicative setting for societies; its beauty and its meaning lie in its connection to human health and self-understanding.
