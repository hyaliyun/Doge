Early years In 1910, Von Baumhauer built a biplane glider along with the Six brothers.Hazewinkel, H.J. Baumhauer, Albert Gillis von (1891-1939). Huygens ING - Den Haag. Bronvermelding, 2013. Web extract In 1913, he built a model of a helicopter with two counter-rotating rotors. The helicopter flew, but it was not stable enough. After having completed studies in Delft, Von Baumhauer studied aerodynamics for some time at G√∂ttingen, and then went to study at the Technical University of Z√ºrich. There, he met professor Theodore von K√°rm√°n and mathematician and aviation expert, professor Ludwig Prandtl. In 1910, Baumhauer joined Spyker car factory, and in 1919 he became chief engineer at Van Berkel, where he was responsible for the development of the Van Berkel W-B, a seaplane for the Dutch Naval Air Service. On 12 May 1919, he married Johanna Hildegonda Oldenhuis Gratama, with whom he had three children.Portrait images of the family von Baumhauer, painted by Otto Sohn-Rethel in 1938, on RKD After closure of the aircraft division of Van Berkel in 1921, von Baumhauer joined the National Research Centre for Aviation where he was a deputy director for some time. Here he devoted himself to various fields of aviation, especially safety in the air, both in wind tunnel tests and in scientific studies.  Manned Helicopter Flight  In 1924, the British Ministry of Aviation announced a contest for the construction of a helicopter, which contained several severe requirements for that time, such as flying a closed circuit with a flight speed of 100 km/h, vertical take-off and climb to up to 600 m, and glide and safe landing with a stopped engine. The prize of ¬£50,000 attracted many contenders, with end data of May 25, 1925, which was later extended by one year. Von Baumhauer went straight to work and enrolled in 1924. On 5 November 1924, he founded, together with one of the brothers Six, the First Dutch Helicopter Aviation, in order to accomplish construction and perform the flights. The helicopter was ready in April 1925, and the first flight was made in September 1925 by Lt. F.H. van Heyst in Soesterberg. On 10 February 1926, Van Heyst managed to keep the machine several metres off the ground for 5 minutes. After the first test flights, the helicopter was transferred to Schiphol in 1926, where B. Grass and later Peter J. Six acted as test pilots. The British contest had been cancelled due to a fatal accident in England, but von Baumhauer continued the experiments until 1930. Several improvements were made, with the flights also getting better, although they often still had a somewhat indefinite direction. On 28 August 1930, von Baumhauer himself made a half-hour flight. The next day, a hinge bolt of one of the rotor blades failed due to a fatigue crack, and the helicopter fell to the ground. The helicopter was completely destroyed, but von Baumhauer was unharmed. Since the money had almost run out, the machine was not rebuilt, but Von Baumhauer's interest in helicopter development continued until the end of his life. Von Baumhauer's design made some major achievements which greatly influenced further development of helicopters.Alex de Voogt.

Web extract It used a single rotor, as opposed to two counter-rotating rotors on which most contemporary designs were based. He was one of the first to use the tail rotor to counteract the torque produced by the main rotor.Leishman, J. Gordon. Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics. Cambridge aerospace series, 18. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. . Web extract The tail rotor was powered by its own engine (for easier control) and its angle of incidence could not be adjusted during flight. Another notable achievement was use of collective and cyclic pitch control.Relly Victoria Petrescu and Florian Ioon Petrescu The Aviation History, page 74. USA, 2013, . The swashplate principle was applied. Below the rotor, two concentric rings were mounted, connected to each other with bearings. The non- rotating inner ring could be tilted and moved along the rotor shaft. The outer ring rotated with the rotor and adjusted blade angles via rods. This enabled adjustment of blade pitch according to the blade's current angle, a mechanism which is still used in modern helicopters.  Other work in Aviation  In 1937, von Baumhauer was appointed an engineer at the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Public Works, where his tasks included testing and inspection of new aircraft types. In March 1939, he went on a study trip to the United States, where he was killed in the accident with the prototype of the four-engine Boeing 307 Stratoliner airliner in Alder, Washington state. At the time of his death, nomination was ready for his appointment as professor at TU Delft. He also found widespread recognition abroad, and was appointed as a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, corresponding member of the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Luftfahrtwissenschaften, and representative of the Netherlands for the Daniel Guggenheim Fund (USA), responsible for aviation safety.

Cairo in 1909, Rome in 1911 and the Venice Biennale in 1934. Thalia Flora-Karavia's work includes a wide range of themes including portraits, landscapes, still lifes, genre scenes and book illustrations. At first she followed the conservative rules of the Academy, but later adopted concepts from Impressionism and Plein air painting. The War Museum of Athens has a large collection of watercolor drawings and pastels by Flora-Karavia from the Balkan Wars and the Greek war in Asia Minor in 1921. The sketches depict the campaigning at Emin Aga in February 1913, an improvised hospital at Philippiada, watering the horses, portable bread ovens, King Constantine I of Greece and his staff and so on. About 70 of her war sketches were purchased from the artist in 1957 and donated to the Municipal Art Gallery of Ioannina.

Founded in 1904, the club's first XI plays in the Premier League of the Sussex Cricket League which is an accredited ECB Premier League, the highest level of recreational club cricket in England and Wales. The First XI have won the Sussex Premier League five times out of the last six seasons (2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 & 2019) and were second in 2017. They were unbeaten in the league in the 2019 season. In addition, the Second XI were Division III champions and have been promoted to Division II for the 2020 season, the highest Division available to them and the Third XI were Division VIII champions and have been promoted to Division VII for the 2020 season. History The first known cricket match arranged under the name of Roffey was played in May 1901 against Barns Green. Occasional matches were held during the next three years until Roffey Cricket Club was formed in 1904. The inaugural meeting was held in the Norfolk Arms public house in Roffey, chaired by W. Barnham. In 1932 the 3.3 acre cricket field was left in trust to the people of Roffey in memory of Colonel Innes and the ground officially became the Innes Memorial Ground. In the mid 1970s Roffey joined the Arun Valley League, which the club went on to win five times before leaving in 1996 to participate in the Sussex Invitation League. In 2001, Roffey were invited to join the Sussex Cricket League.

A typical application is a seller who wants to sell some items to potential buyers. The seller wants to price the items in a way that will maximize their profit. The optimal prices depend on the amount that each buyer is willing to pay for each item. The seller does not know these amounts, but he assumes that they are drawn from a certain known probability distribution. The phrase \\"Bayesian optimal mechanism design\\" has the following meaning: * Bayesian means that we know the probability- distribution from which the agents' valuations are drawn (in contrast to prior-free mechanism design, which do not assume any prior probability distribution). * Optimal means that we want to maximize the expected revenue of the auctioneer, where the expectation is over the randomness in the agents' valuations. * Mechanism means that we want to design rules that define a truthful mechanism, in which each agent has an incentive to report his true value.  Example  There is one item for sale. There are two potential buyers. The valuation of each buyer is drawn i.i.d. from the uniform distribution on [0,1]. The Vickrey auction is a truthful mechanism and its expected profit, in this case, is 1/3 (the first-price sealed-bid auction is a non-truthful mechanism and its expected profit is the same). This auction is not optimal. It is possible to get a better profit by setting a reservation price. The Vickrey auction with a reservation price of 1/2 achieves an expected profit of 5/12, which in this case is optimal.  Notation  We assume that the agents have single-parameter utility functions, such as a single-item auction. Each agent i has a value v_i which represents the agent's \\"winning value\\" (e.g, the agent's valuation of the item). We do not know these values, but we do know that each v_i is drawn i.i.d. from a certain probability distribution. We denote by F_i the cumulative distribution function: :F_i(z) = \\\\Pr[v_i and by f_i the probability distribution function: :f_i(z) = F_i'(z) An allocation is a vector x, such that for every i, x_i is 1 if agent i wins and 0 otherwise. Each allocation might have a cost to the auctioneer, c(x). The surplus of an allocation is defined as: :S(x) = \\\\sum_i x_i\\\\cdot v_i - c(x) This is the total gain of the agents, minus the cost of the auctioneer. The surplus is the largest possible profit. If each winning agent i pays exactly his value v_i, then the profit of the auctioneer is exactly the surplus S(x); this means that the auctioneer takes all the surplus to himself and leaves zero utility to the agents. This maximal profit cannot be attained because if the auctioneer will try to charge each winning agent his value v_i, the agents will lie and report a lower value in order to pay less. The Myerson mechanism comes to address this problem.  The Myerson mechanism  Roger Myerson designed a Bayesian-optimal mechanism for single-parameter utility agents. The key trick in Myerson's mechanism is to use virtual valuations. For every agent i, define its virtual valuation as: :w_i(v_i) = v_i - \\\\frac{1-F_i(v_i)}{f_i(v_i)} Note that the virtual valuation is usually smaller than the actual valuation. It is even possible that the virtual valuation be negative while the actual valuation is positive. Define the virtual surplus of an allocation x as: :S^*(x) = \\\\sum_i x_i\\\\cdot w_i(v_i) - c(x) Note that the virtual surplus is usually smaller than the actual surplus. A key theorem of Myerson says that: :::The expected profit of any truthful mechanism is equal to its expected virtual surplus. (the expectation is taken over the randomness in the agents' valuations). This theorem suggests the following mechanism: *Ask each agent i to report his valuation v_i *Based on the answer and the known distribution functions F_i,f_i, compute w_i. *Compute an allocation x that maximizes the virtual surplus S^*(x). To complete the description of the mechanism, we should specify the price that each winning agent has to pay. One way to calculate the price is to use the VCG mechanism on the virtual valuations w_i. The VCG mechanism returns both an allocation that maximizes the virtual surplus and a price-vector. Since the price-vector corresponds to the virtual-valuations, we must convert it back to the real- valuation space. So the final step of the mechanism is: *Take from each winning agent i the price p_i = w_i^{-1}(p'_i), where p'_i is the price determined by the VCG mechanism. = Truthfulness = The Myerson mechanism is truthful whenever the allocation rule satisfies the weak monotonicity property, i.e, the allocation function is weakly increasing in the agents' valuations. The VCG allocation rule is indeed weakly-increasing in the valuations, but we use it with the virtual-valuations rather than the real valuations. Hence, the Myerson mechanism is truthful if the virtual-valuations are weakly-increasing in the real valuations. I.e, if for all i: w_i is a weakly-increasing function of v_i. If w_i is not a weakly-increasing function of v_i, then Myerson ironing can be used. Myerson's mechanism can be applied in various settings. Two examples are presented below. = Single-item auction = Suppose we want to sell a single item, and we know that the valuations of all agents come from the same probability distribution, with functions F,f. Then, all bidders have the same virtual-valuation function, w. Suppose that this function is weakly-increasing. In this case, the VCG mechanism reduces to the Vickrey auction: it allocates the item to the agent with the largest valuation (highest bid). But Myerson's mechanism uses VCG with the virtual valuations, which may be negative. Hence, Myerson's mechanism, in this case, reduces to Vickrey auction with reservation price. It allocates the item to the agent with the largest valuation, but only if its virtual valuation is at least 0. This means that the reservation price of Myerson's mechanism is exactly: :w^{-1}(0) So, if we know the probability distribution functions F,f, we can calculate the function w, and from it, find the optimal reservation price. = Digital-goods auction = In a digital goods auction, we have an unlimited supply of identical items. Each agent wants at most one item. The valuations of the agents to the item come from the same probability distribution, with functions F,f and virtual-valuation function w. The VCG mechanism allocates an item to each agent with non-negative virtual-valuation, and charges the minimum winning price, which is: :w^{-1}(0) This exactly equals the optimal sale price - the price that maximizes the expected value of the seller's profit, given the distribution of valuations: :\\\\arg\\\\max_z {z\\\\cdot (1-F(z))}  Alternatives  Bayesian-optimal mechanism design requires knowing the distributions from which agents' valuations are drawn. This requirement is not always feasible. There are some other alternatives: * When the distribution is not known, a prior-independent mechanism can be used. * When it cannot even be assumed that the agents are drawn from some probability distribution, a prior-free mechanism should be used.

Market Coupling  4M MC is an ATC based day- ahead implicit allocation process striving on the compatibility with the EU Target Model while taking into account the fact that 4M solution is to be considered as an interim step before the Central Eastern European (‚ÄúCEE‚Äù) regional solution. The primary target of the market coupling is to assure a deeper integration of regional power markets. The process aims at maximizing the energy flow from the low price area to the high price area by taking into account the available cross-border capacity. Consequently, price levels among the individual market areas converge. By this procedure, not only the security of supply can be increased but the price volatility on relevant power markets can be moderated and the power sale and purchase can become more effective. The Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian NRAs, TSOs and PXs jointly implemented the extension of CZ-SK-HU Market Coupling to Romanian day-ahead electricity market (4M MC) on 19 November 2014 based on PCR solution.

He was from the city of Iliberis (Granada, or identified by modern scholars as likely being in or near Albayz√≠n), and, while there is no clear information around this, it is believed he was not of a patrician family but was one of the equites. Anullinus served as the governor of the Roman province of Hispania Baetica in 170, and the later emperor Severus would serve under him as quaestor. It is believed (though there is no documentary evidence of this) that the two had met earlier in Rome, and Severus served at Anullinus's request. He may (or may not) have been legate of the Roman province of Africa proconsularis in 193. Anullinus took command from Tiberius Claudius Candidus of Severus' field army in the war against Pescennius Niger in 193. In the following year he delivered a crushing defeat to Niger at the Battle of Issus, during the Year of the Five Emperors. Anullinus must have reached consular rank before the year 196 since he was praefectus urbi of Rome that year. He afterwards commanded one of the divisions of the army which Severus sent against the city of Adiabene, in 197.

The adverts were presented by DJ and BBC presenter Jimmy Savile and featured the then-new InterCity 125 high-speed train. Background Although a state-owned corporation at the time, British Rail was under pressure to operate on a more commercial basis. In attempt to revive its loss-making business, BR chairman Sir Peter Parker commissioned a series of commercials from Peter Marsh of the advertising agency Allen, Brady and Marsh (ABM). The agency reportedly won the pitch to BR by keeping their visiting executives waiting for a long time in a dirty room surrounded by overflowing ashtrays and coffee-stained furniture; after the executives' patience came to an end and they were about to leave in disgust, Marsh entered the room to greet them, explaining that their treatment had been a ruse to illustrate the customer experience of BR, and that his agency would be able put it right. The reason Savile was selected to front the advertising campaign, was because at the time, he was perceived as being both a popular and family-friendly television personality. The slogan, \\"This is the Age of the Train\\", is credited to the advertising executive Rod Allen, also of ABM. The advertisements continued to be produced until 1984, when they were replaced with a new campaign based on the slogan, \\"We're getting there\\". In 2012, during the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, it was alleged by a former BR lawyer that the decision to drop Savile from the adverts had been made due to suspicions he was a necrophiliac.

He was the first member of the patrician Han family of Lasem to hold an official government position, that of Kapitein der Chinezen of Surabaya. He was also the pachter, or leaseholder, of the government districts of Besuki and Panarukan. Han Bwee Kong was born in 1727 at the port city of Lasem in Central Java. He was the youngest of five sons born to Han Siong Kong (1673 ‚Äì 1743), a Chinese migrant of ancient lineage, by an unnamed woman, probably a native or of at least part-native ancestry. Sometime in the first half of the eighteenth century, he moved to East Java with two of his elder brothers, the Chinese-Javanese leader Soero Pernollo (1720 ‚Äì 1776) and Han Hing Kong. By 1748 at the latest, Han Bwee Kong had contracted a highly advantageous marriage to the Peranakan daughter of a prominent Chinese leader in Surabaya, Tan Ho Goan (1672 ‚Äì 1744). The couple had twelve sons and two daughters. Probably as a result of his wife's family backing, Han Bwee Kong was eventually appointed Kapitein der Chinezen of Surabaya at an unknown date. This position gave him governmental authority over the Chinese community of Surabaya as part of the Dutch colonial system of Indirect Rule. In 1768, with the help of his elder brother, the ennobled Ngabehi Soero Pernollo, police chief of Besuki and Panarukan, Kapitein Han Bwee Kong became the leaseholder of the district of Besuki for an annual tribute of 10 koyans of rice and 1,000 rixdollars to the Dutch East India Company. In exchange, he helped his brother's son, the future Adipati Soero Adinegoro, obtain a government appointment as Ronggo of Besuki in 1772. The Kapitein further obtained the lease for the district of Panarukan in 1777 for an annual tribute to the Company of 500 Spanish dollars. He died in 1778, and is buried together with his wife in Pasar Bong, or Market of the Chinese Cemetery, in Surabaya. He is identified on his tombstone by the personal name of 'Zhensi', or 'He who Shakes Surabaya'. His eldest son and deputy, Han Khee Bing, Luitenant der Chinezen (1749 ‚Äì 1768) predeceased him. So, he was succeeded as Kapitein der Chinezen of Surabaya and leaseholder of Besuki and Panarukan by his fifth and eldest surviving son, Han Chan Piet, Majoor der Chinezen (1759 ‚Äì 1827). Another son, Han Kik Ko, Majoor der Chinezen (1766 ‚Äì 1813), also attained prominence as Majoor der Chinezen, Temenggong and landlord of the district Probolinggo. Kapitein Han Bwee Kong's descendants, as part of the baba bangsawan or Cabang Atas, or the Chinese gentry of Java, would play a significant role in the political and economic life of colonial Indonesia until the end of Dutch rule in 1945.

Their members are musicians from the Catalan counties of Ripoll√®s, Osona and Garrotxa. Nowadays, the band is composed of Alguer Miquel (voice), Marcel L√°zara, a.k.a. Tito (voice, guitar), Sergi Carbonell, a.k.a. Hipi (keyboard), Joaquim Canals (drums), √Älex Pujols (bass guitar), Pau Puig (percussion), Ivan L√≥pez (saxophone) and Jordi Barnola (trumpet). They propose a musical fusion, taking Reggae as the mainstay, influenced by Dubstep, Latin music or Pop, and mixing Jamaican music, Rock and Latin sonorities. The band introduces itself in an imaginary connected to the circus clowns.  History  Txarango's seed was planted in 2006. It started in the Gothic Quarter, Barcelona, in the student flat of the singer Alguer Miquel, the guitarist Marcel L√°zara a.k.a. Tito and the keyboardist Sergi Carbonell a.k.a. Hipi. Near Pla√ßa George Orwell, also known colloquially as Tripi square, they started giving impromptu concerts on the streets with musicians from all around the world. It was there where different experiences and sounds were shared. Marcel \\"Tito\\", started playing a charango, a small stringed instrument from the central region of the Andes, with Alguer and Sergi \\"Hipi\\". All three of them agreed to capture that festive spirit of the street music and to take it to the stages as a new project named after Marcel's instrument: Txarang√∂, with a diaeresis over the \\"o\\". The band started in 2007, playing all around Catalonia. Together with Manu Chao, Gambeat, Radio Bemba and Che Sudaka, they took part in La Pegatina's debut album, Al Carrer (Self-publishing, 2007), featuring in La Pegatina's first single Penjat. They ended that year on 2 November in Sala KGB Barcelona, with a shared concert with La Pegatina, a sold-out concert. After recording a maxi-single of 7 tracks named Conjuro (Self-publishing, 2008), at the recording studio Nomada57, Barcelona, Txarang√∂ decided to split up and start a new musical path with other projects. =Welcome To Clownia (2010-2011)= In 2010 after closing their phase with the group Vall Folk, Alguer, Tito and Hipi decided to work on their new music project. They knew that this new vehicle would be based, firstly, on a very own imaginary and lyrics, before tackling the music. In the free and nomad spirit of the circus, they found their inspiration to start talking about Clownia: a magic place where every street artist they grew up with in Tripi square would play. Even though they didn't have much to do with their predecessor, they reused the name of Txarango, without the diaeresis over the \\"o\\". Txarango made their first steps with Alguer Miquel (voice), Marcel L√°zara \\"Tito\\" (voice), Sergi Carbonell \\"Hipi\\" (piano), Joaquim Canals (drums) and √Älex Pujols (bass). Their cover letter was a single, Welcome to Clownia (Self-publishing, 2010), recorded in Can Pardaler (Taradell). It was made up by two songs: \\"Nits amb Txarango\\" and \\"Vola\\". On 18 December 2010, they introduced themselves live in Sala Eudald Graells in Ripoll, sharing the stage with Intifada and Empalmaos. This first concert, which gathered 800 people, had the special collaborations of La Pegatina, Malakaton and The Sey Sisters. That year, they became part of the record label Tercera Via. Together they worked in the first season where they had 50 concerts and they stepped on the stages of festivals such as UnnimEthnival (Girona), SonR√≠asBaixas Bueu, Gal√≠cia, Acampada Jove Montblanc, Musik'n'viu Granollers, Esdansa Les Preses, In-Somni and the traveling festival FesTOUR. They gather a total of 40,000 spectators. \\"Vola\\" and \\"Nits amb Txarango\\" have 100,000 reproductions on their official page, 100,000 more in YouTube, and 25,000 in MySpace, and they have had two lipdubs made by groups of young people of Angl√©s and Igualada. This first year of life of Txarango peaked on 31 October 2011 with a concert in Castanyada Rock in Piera, where they shared stage with Bongo Botrako, Brams, and Stombers. Before 3,000 people as public, they announced they were going back into the studio in order to record their first album. = Benvinguts al llarg viatge (2012) = January 2012, Txarango signed up with √âxists Produccions & Management agency and they came back to the studio of Can Pardaler in Taradell in order to release their first album. Benvinguts al llarg viatge was the definitive title of the album. It had 14 songs and featured La Pegatina, Bongo Botrako, La troba Kung-F√∫, Yacine & The Oriental Groove, Gertrudis, Cesk Freixas, David Rosell (Dept. i Brams), The Sey Sisters and Itaca Band. They, all together, recorded a new version of \\"Vola\\", the only single they recovered from Welcome to Clownia. After finishing the recording, Miquel Rojo left Txarango because of an incompatibility with other musical plans and he was replaced by Jordi Barnola. On February 16, the day Carnival started, Benvinguts al llarg viatge was published in their official page for free. The band chose this festivity, devoted to fun, as a link to their happy and festive universe. In the first 24 hours, more than 5,000 people downloaded the album. Tickets went on sale on the 16th April for their presentation concert on 18 April in in Barcelona. They sold out 1,200 seats in 13 days. In March, Txarango became the first band to be cover of the magazine Enderrock without having released any physical CD yet. The record label DiscMedi reached an agreement with the band to release Benvinguts al llarg viatge in compact disc, which was released coinciding with a presentation at , Barcelona. Before the concert, in view of their growing popularity, they gave two little concerts of half an hour in the Enderrock Awards, held on 12 March at Sala Apolo, and on 30 March in Parc del F√≤rum of Barcelona, as part of the Telecogresca,Clip de Pren al carrer enregistrat al Parc del F√≤rum in front of 5,000 people. The first official concert of the new tour in the Barcelona concert hall received praise from the local press. At the same time, one of the songs of the album, \\"Amagada primavera\\", was involved in the festivity of Sant Jordi in TV3 and Catalunya R√†dio.Clip dAmagada Primavera interpretat el dia de Sant Jordi al plat√≥ dels Matins In June, the band was chosen, among more than a hundred Catalan submitted proposals, to participate in the State Circuit of Concert Halls, Artistas en Ruta, during that very same autumn. The Benvinguts al llarg viatge tour included fifty dates, with stops in most regions of Catalonia, and a few festivals such as l'In-Somni, Acampada Jove, Garrinada d'Argentona, Altaveu de Sant Boi de Llobregat, Festa per la Llibertat, Mercat de M√∫sica Viva de Vic i Petit Camaleons de Sant Cugat del Vall√®s. On this tour, Txarango also played in some international festivals such as Festival les Feux of l'√ât√©, in France, and Pol√© Pol√© in Ghent, Flanders. =Som Riu (2014)= On March 18, 2014, Txarango released their new CD called Som Riu. The album was released on their website to be downloaded freely as they had done before.

The story features He Shican, a homosexual studio owner who becomes smitten with Huang Jiulang, a fox spirit, and their subsequent lives as a reborn government official and the lover of another gay official, respectively. \\"Cut Sleeve\\" is notable for being a full-length narrative on homosexuality in China; the title alludes to Emperor Ai of Han's same-sex relationship with Dong Xian.  Background  Pu Songling was a Qing dynasty author active in the seventeenth century. Homosexuality in China, though commonplace, was regarded as a taboo and \\"off- centre\\" practice. Chinese society saw homosexuality as an \\"illness (...) (or) addiction (Áôñ) over which one does not have control\\" that stemmed from \\"sexual frustration or sense of inferiority\\". An oft-used euphemism during Pu's time for male homosexuality was \\"cut-sleeve\\", a reference to \\"the passion of the cut sleeve\\" between Liu Xin, better known as Emperor Ai of Han, and Han politician Dong Xian. According to History of the Han, the emperor, upon finding Dong sleeping on his sleeve, called to a meeting while lying with his lover, and cut off his sleeve rather than stir the boy from his sleep. Plot A mule-riding middle-aged woman and a young man pass by a studio. Its owner He Shican (‰ΩïÂ∏àÂèÇ), a homosexual, straight away falls in love with the boy, whom he describes as \\"a quite extraordinary personal beauty\\". The next day, a besotted He bumps into the boy, who later on introduces himself as Huang Jiulang (ÈªÑ‰πùÈÉé). The two develop a friendship and upon inviting him into his residence for a drink, He makes known his affection for Huang. However, He's sexual advances towards Huang are unsuccessful and the latter leaves. He is crestfallen and becomes emaciated. Huang soon learns of this; revealing that he too is gay, he reluctantly agrees to copulate with He, on the condition that he procures some medicine for Huang's ailing mother. He Shican's condition improves, but he learns from his doctor that he has been possessed, with his life on the line. Huang confirms that he is a fox spirit but He remains incredulous. Shortly after He's health deteriorates rapidly and he dies, leaving Huang devastated. Simultaneously, court censor Gong commits suicide with his wife, in fear of the corrupt Provincial Treasurer of Shaanxi, Wang, whom he was a fierce critic of. He's spirit occupies the dead official's body; incidentally, Gong was also He's childhood familiar. Wang, now Governor, learns of this resurrection and starts to hound him. He Shican desperately returns to Huang, wanting to rekindle their romance. Huang refuses and instead refers He to his female cousin, whom he instantly takes a liking to. Yet the threat of the Shaanxi governor remains and He beseeches Huang to help him out, upon learning that Wang is homosexual as well. The governor receives Huang and is \\"utterly captivated\\"; he begins to obsess himself with Huang and his health is slowly sapped. Eventually he dies, and Huang inherits much of his wealth. Meanwhile, his cousin and He, apparently having become heterosexual, tie the knot. Complementing the tale is a \\"Jesting Judgement\\" by Pu Songling; the poem echoes Mengzi's belief that \\"(t)he coming together in sexual congress of man and woman is one of the great natural bonds in human relations.\\" Reception Most scholars of Chinese literature are in agreement that \\"Cut Sleeve\\" is both criticising and satirising homosexuality in China. Judith T. Zeitlin writes in Historian of the Strange that the story, which \\"has a fixed penchant for homosexuality\\", \\"starts to slip into comedy when as a reward for his devotion he is 'converted' to heterosexuality in his next incarnation\\". She then criticises Pu's appended poem as \\"an amazingly arcane and rather hostile parody in parallel prose on homosexual practices\\". John Minford, who translated the story in the Penguin edition of Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, takes the opposite conclusion, that the poem \\"pokes fun at the anti- homosexual lobby\\" by spoofing \\"pedantic neo-Confucian prudery\\". Finally, Stevenson and Wu (2012) consider that \\"on the surface [the tale is] poorly structured\\", and that Pu was ultimately unsuccessful in exploring one of the themes of greater importance in the story, that of the unseen, which concerns here both the supernatural and the unseen motivations of its characters. They recommend not drawing serious conclusions from the appended poem, whose title they translate as \\"Amusing Assessment\\". \\"Cut Sleeve\\" is frequently cited as an early example of homosexual erotica in Chinese literature; Xiao (1997) remarks that \\"Huang Jiulang's act of love ended up killing He Shican\\".  Translations  The story is titled \\"Huang Jiulang\\" (ÈªÑ‰πùÈÉé), after one of the main characters. It was translated into English by John Minford in 2006 as \\"Cut Sleeve\\"; one of the opening lines reveals that the protagonist He Shican is \\"of the Cut Sleeve persuasion\\". Sidney L. Sondergard's translation of the story, released in 2008, is titled Huang the Ninth. The story was translated into Russian by Vasily Alekseyev in 1923.–≠—Ç–Ω–æ–∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –≤ –ï–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–∏. –¢–æ–º 2. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 2006. . C. 159.

The Horta of Valencia consists of Valencia and three comarcas: Horta Nord, Horta Sud, Horta Oest.  Demography  It is the most populated region of Pa√≠s Valenci√†. The Horta of Valencia has also experienced the greatest increase in population, especially as an immigrant receiver. Its urban expansion has motivated the creation of several urbanisations [LEX], and the incorporation to the urban nucleus of the metropolis of the earlier towns. Nowadays, the expansion has also contributed to its separation in four regions that are currently considered sub-regions.  Geography  The region is located within Pu√ßol (in the North), the Albufera (in the South), and Paterna, Torrent and Montcada (in the West). It is a lowland region that elevates progressively from the sea towards the inland. =The Horta at the Territory [LEX] of Valencia= It might be surprising that people preserve the Valencian agricultural traditions so near [LEX, GRAM] the city of Valencia and also [EST] the presence of traditional cabins for agricultural purposes, called barraques''' [SEM]', as well as the traditional paths along the Horta, even if the city has caused negative effects because of the building of many landfills, waste ground, and workshops. This situation, together with the construction of new high-speed rails and dual carriageways, has cut up the Horta into different parts. Also, it has left little areas of countryside surrounded by huge infrastructures. That is a problem that has an impact not only in farmers' lives, but also in neighbours'. Here is a list of the different areas in the territory of Valencia: Horta of Campanar The Horta of Campanar is located in the North West of the Campanar district. In the north, it shares its border with the dual carriageway that connects Valencia and Paterna. In the west, it is in front of Horta of Paterna, and in the south, it borders with Horta of Quart de Poblet, Mislata and the river Turia. In the east, it shares border with Ronda Nord [SEM] of Valencia and the neighbourhoods of Beniferri and Campanar. Horta of Faitanar The Horta of Faitanar is the section of Horta of Valencia that is located in the south [ORT] of the new river bed of the Turia River and in the west [ORT] of Forn d'Alcedo. In the south [ORT] , it borders with Picanya and Paiporta, and in the north [ORT] west [ORT] , it is in front of Xirivella where the Horta continues without cracking. Horta of the Moreres or of the Punta The Horta of the Moreres or of the Punta [ORT] belongs to the farmland of the towns La Font [GRAM, FS] de Sant Lluis, La Font d'Encorts, La Punta and Natzaret. It extends its territory from Ronda Sud [SEM] and the City of Arts and Sciences to the new river bed of the Turia River [ORT] . Horta of the Castellar-l'Oliveral In the neighbourhood of Castellar-l'Oliveral, there is a territory of the Horta between the new river bed of the Turia River [ORT] and Sedav√≠. Horta of Vera The Horta of Vera is the ancient Horta of Benimaclet and Alboraia. Nowadays, the south [ORT] belongs to Valencia and the north [ORT] to Alboraia. A great part of it has been urbanised and transformed into the neighbourhoods of Cam√≠ of Vera and Vega Baixa. In the north, there are still some farmlands and barraques [SEM]. Horta of Orriols In the north of the neighbourhoods of Orriols (previously, a village) and of Sant Lloren√ß, between the limit of Alboraia and Ronda Nord of Valencia, Horta of Orriols lives on and continues all along until the city of Alboraia. Horta of Pobles del Nord Thanks to the isolation from the big cities, big areas of the Horta live on in the region of Pobles del Nord. Pinedo and El Palmar Although mainly all [EST] the land is dedicated to the cultivation of rice, a significant number barraques [SEM] and other elements related to the Horta, such as ditches, live on in the villages of Pinedo and El Palmar. Origin The Valencian Horta came up [NMS, PRAG] in the time of the Roman Empire. The city of Valentia was founded as the logistics centre and the hibernation [FS, LEX] place for the Roman campaigns for the conquest of the Iberia. The Romans contributed to these lands with the crops they knew, such as the cultivation of cereals, olive or vine. Nevertheless, on account of the typical conditions of the environment, the crops were not productive enough. Still, the crops were useful in supplying the Roman armies and, later, for the campaigns of the Visigoths, who left the fields and the cityFS]. The Valencian Horta as we know it today was developed in the medieval times, during the Islamic period. An important fluvial infrastructure was created, mainly thanks to the construction of ditches and assuts (little dams that led the waters of the Turia River and the precipices that could drain marshy areas and bring down the watering [TERM] to the fields). Likewise, different activities were boosted and developed near those infrastructures, such as the watermills, which profited the [GRAM] water flow of the ditches and the washbasins near the houses and farmsteads. Thanks to those infrastructures, the city of Valencia, as well as its surrounding villages, was able to expand successfully. A rich production area was created. The origin of Horta of Valencia comes from the Al-Alandalus period, as a consequence of the introduction of the Arabic irrigation tradition (Yemen and Syria), just like the North African berebers did [FS]. The cultivations were really unequal [CS], due to an independent and tributary society. In addition to the typical crops of the Roman period (cereal, vine, olive), the rice and the tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus) and new vegetables from Al-Andalus, such as aubergine, artichoke, etc [GRAM]. Those new crops are [REG] typical from the damp zones. The crops par excellence are [REG] the [AD] horticultural products, hence the name of this environment. There are eight principal ditches: Montcada, Tormos, Mestalla, Rascanya, Quart-Ben√†ger-Faitanar, Mislata, Favara and Rovella. Except for Montcada, the rest are ruled by the \\"Tribunal de les Aig√ºes\\", which is an institution than [GRAM] controls the use and the utilisation [AD] of the irrigation flow. This institution is still working nowadays and its members assemble [LEX] at the door of the Cathedral of Valencia once a week.  Economy  = Agriculture = In the typical Mediterranean climate, the Horta has mild winters and very hot [FS] summers. The historical activity of the region had [la coher√®ncia entre temps verbals d'una frase a una altra √©s necess√†ria pel b√© del lector si no hi ha un canvi significat d'√®poca al text] been agriculture, with a predominance of three types of crops: orange, vegetables and rice. The watering system is structured around 13 ditches [NMS: ditch √©s una rasa per a drenar el terra, s√®quia √©s un concepte molt valenci√† que hauria d'usar-se a la traducci√≥ precedit d'una explicaci√≥ la primera volta que apareix al text] that allow irrigation crops all year. Some municipal areas have a certain expertise regarding crops: tiger nut in Alboraia and Alm√†ssera; tomatoes and peppers for canning El Puig [GRAM], Pu√ßol and Tavernes Blanques; strawberries in Rafelbunyol; melons and watermelos [ORT] in Meliana and Alm√†ssera, and so on. Rice is distressed [LEX], but it is still being cultivated on the edges of the Albufera.  Industry  To the west [ORT] of the region, towns are situated on the edge of the Horta, around the capital city: Montcada, with textile and fireworks [GRAM] industries; Burjassot, together with Godella, with ceramic and cement factories; Paterna, Manises and Quart de Poblet, which have an important ceramic industry; Mislata, which presents paper and textile industries, and so on. In the north [ORT] , the towns follow a parallel line to [GRAM] the coast: Tavernes Blanques, with ceramic and porcelain industries; Massamagrell, Meliana, Pu√ßol, basically agricultural, etc. In the south, there are several towns physically attached [LEX] to each other: Benet√∫sser, Alfafar, Poblenou de la Corona, Sedav√≠, Massanassa, Catarroja and Silla. The capital city of the region, Valencia, which is also that of Pa√≠s Valenci√† with more than 760 000 [ORT] inhabitants, currently maintains the agriculture that made it famous in the past, but it has also developed a lot [REG] of industry (furniture, chemical, mechanical) and trade.

It is also known as the festival of Saint Peter. In addition, this celebration has been named as a Traditional Festival of National Interest by the Generalitat (Government of Catalonia). It has dozens of events which revolve around the tronada (the most revered daytime fireworks show). Giants of Reus  History  St. Peter's and St. Paul's Day, held on 29 June, has been celebrated in Reus since its foundation in the 12th century. One of the earliest streets known in the town was renamed as St. Peter street in 1368. A new square called St. Peter's Square was built in front of the church in the 17th century, in 1611. The devotion to Saint Peter increased in 1625 and 1626, when a relic of the saint was brought to town, and a big celebration was prepared to receive it. It was announced for 7 November 1625. Since the arrival of the relic, St. Peter's Day has been a special date in the holiday calendar of Reus. The procession has been the core of the celebration of the Summer Festival of Reus for many years. It is always accompanied by a festive entourage, and the competent authorities in town. Religious ceremonies were suppressed because of the 1868 Glorious Revolution of Spain, but the parades of Giants and the Mulassa (the figure of a mule) remained. The dances of the festive entourage, parties and balls also remained among the society in the city. Following the Restoration, the festivity returned to its traditional and religious events. The city did not celebrate another secular festival until the Second Spanish Republic, but since 1900 there have been intense debates about the involvement of councillors in processions or municipal aid for religious events. Since the 1980s, the festival has returned as a \\"traditional popular festivity\\". Some traditional components have been revived and others created. An important part of the components forming the current festive entourage of Reus were already documented in the 17th and the 18th centuries. The figure of the giants, the Mulassa, the dance of sticks, the dwarves and the devils have remained present throughout the years without interruption. Other old dances disappeared between the 18th and 19th centuries and were later recovered in the late 20th century. The gypsy dance, the dance of Joan de Vic, the dance of Prims, the Cercolets dance, the dance of the little horses, the dance of the Valencian people, the Galeras dance, the Bull of Reus, the dance of the Ladies and the Old Men, and the Eagle have been reintroduced to the festivity in an attempt to try and continue with the traditional events the old documents in town specify. Some of these elements are exceptional because they can only be viewed in Reus, as is the case of the dance of Prims, the dance of Joan de Vic, or the Galeras dance. Moreover, new elements have also been incorporated, based on typical elements of Catalonia. For example, the Cannon, the Giant Carrasclet, the dragon, the viper, the basilisk, the masquerade, the spoken dance of carrasclet, and the castles. These last ones, present in Reus since the 19th century, represent Reus' status as a fortified city. Giants of Reus  Description  The central and final day of the festival is celebrated on Saint Peter's day, 29 June, but there are several activities that are held before. The festival begins immediately after Saint John's festivities, celebrated on Mid Summer's Eve across Catalonia (Flama de Canig√≥) on 23 June. This solstice stretches out across the towns of the Baix Camp (a region in Catalonia), the parade of the giant Carrasclet, the parade of fire or the Devil‚Äôs dance, and the bonfire. On 24 June, in the Plenary Hall of the City, the Preg√≥ (the opening of the festival) takes place. When finished, the award Tro de Festa is given to a distinguished person for having made an anonymous contribution to the festival. The pregoner (\\"town crier or bellman\\" in English), accompanied by a group of ministrels, makes an appeal from the balcony of the town hall and goes down to the Mercadal square in order to light off the first \\"tronada\\" of the festival. From the 25th to the 27th, a cannon goes outside in order to announce the festival. On 27th the Festa major Petita (\\"the small festival\\" in English) begins with small groups of children parading (they participate with traditional dances, depiction of biblical characters, allegorical representations, etc.). During the days from Saint John to Saint Peter, there are several festive events such as the Masclet (typical festival‚Äôs drink) parade, the Cossos (traditional games tournament), a traditional dinner made of beef and rice or the theatrical performance of the dance of the Ladies and the Old Men. The Saturday preceding Saint Peter, the Diada Castellera (name of a gathering where colles build castells) of Saint Peter is held. They also dance sardanes (Catalan popular dance), they hold all kind of concerts, fireworks, Barraques de Festa Major (concerts), etc. The week of the events culminates on the eve of Saint Peter, on 28 June. From 9 am to 5 pm, you can hear the bell of the tower ringing on the occasion of the festival, and see the parade of festive groups of the city, groups such as: L'√Äguila (The eagle), Els Gegants (The giants), Els Nanos (The dwarves) and La Mulassa (The mule). At 8 pm, the seguici from Reus, with the relevant authorities, do a walk around St. Peter‚Äôs Priory. During the ceremony, the image of the saint is taken out from the church. The image is normally saved in a closed altar under a triple lock. The keys are held by the Major of the city, and Saint Peter‚Äôs prior. Formerly, they were also held by the community of priests. Nowadays, one of these keys is held by the oldest Monsignor of the city. After returning to the church, the second \\"tronada\\" begins, and then a firework explodes. This firework gives way to a series of activities in different parts of the city, lasting until dawn. In St. Peter‚Äôs Day, 29 June at 7 am, a parade formed by diverse groups of grallers and tabalers (musicians playing traditional music) takes place in the early morning. At 9 am, people normally light up firecrackers on el despertar de Reus (\\"the awakening of Reus\\"). At 10 am, the doors of the bell tower are open for the citizens, the only day of the year it can be visited. At half past eleven in the morning, the third tronada explodes and the exhibition of folkloric groups takes place in the middle of Mercadal Square. Later, they carry out the performance of the human towers with the Xiquets de Reus, which is the main group of human towers in Reus. On 29 June, the Seguici Festiu (a set of festive elements participating in the parades and processions), the authorities and the public meet again in Mercadal Square. They go in procession until St. Peter's Priory to search for the image of the patron saint, which is carried in procession until Mercadal Square and just at the time when it stops before the City Hall the last tronada is launched. During the procession, from the bell-tower, the Toc General de Festa (an event in which people ring a big bell) is performed. Afterwards, the Seguici returns to St. Peter's Priory and at the time the Image enters the church, all festive elements burst into dance at the same time. As a culmination to the festivities, the gegants bicentenaris (\\"bicentennial giants\\") and the √Åguila (\\"The eagle\\") return to the Square to perform the last dances, followed by a bunch of demons who are in charge of closing the festivity. Some elements of the Seguici Festiu have their counterpart in the celebration of the Festa Major Petita, and they form the Seguici Festiu Petit (it is the same as the Seguici Festiu but with the participation of children). It all started in 1997, when the Colla gegantera (a group of local entertainment of the city) created the gegantons Fadrins (a sort of giants who make different dances) and then the Mulassa petita (the same as the Mulassa but for children), due to the large number of boys and girls who participated at the trips of the colla (group of friends or partners of a common activity). Now, on 27 June the Festa Major Petita begins, with all the festive elements that follow the guidelines of the big ones. We have today, aside from the gegants and the mulassa, the dance of the devils for children, the dance of bastons (sticks) for children, the Drac (\\"The Dragon\\") for children, the Dance of the 'Valencian children', the Dance of the gypsies for children, Nanos (\\"The dwarves\\") for children, the dance of cercolets for children, the Dance of prims for children and the Dance of pastorets (\\"shepherds\\") for children.Eagle in Reus Basilisk in Reus  Barraques in Reus  Barraques in Reus is a set of concerts and festive activities performed in Reus as a starting point for the festivities of Saint Peter. They are held during Saint John's day. They usually last four days, although in 2009 they lasted five, for their tenth anniversary. Saint John's festivity is the most remarkable date in town. The Coordination Group of Barraques in Reus consists of different entities, currently 24, forming the entity that organises the whole festivity in different sectors. From the early years, the festivity of Barraques was performed in the Mas d'Igl√©sies of Reus, a green area rather isolated from the centre, but not too far away. The area was of quick access and had a good seating area. From 2008 the location changed and it started to be performed at the Roqu√≠s, at the Parc de la Festa, a waste ground located next to the municipal swimming-pools of Reus. This change of location initially provoked much criticism in the City Hall. Among the bands that acted, we can highlight Mesclat, Habeas Corpus, Obrint Pas, Lax'n'Busto, Companyia El√®ctrica Dharma, Soziedad alkoh√≥lika, Al Tall, Kiko Veneno, Els Pets, Barricada and The Pinker Tones. Other activities are performed during the festival, such as a contest to make the poster of Barraques and trips to different villages where they conduct their own festivals.

This legend places the Senyera Reial origins on Wilfred the Hairy. Specifically, it narrates that the sign of the four bars was created after a battle against the Normans, when the King of the Franks doused his hands in the blood of Wilfred the Hairy's injuries. After swiping his fingers over the golden shield of the Earl of Barcelona he said: \\"These will be your arms, Earl\\". The Legend of the Four Blood Bars does not appear in any other historical work before Beuter's work in 1551, even though the affiliation of Senyal Reial to the lineage of the Barcelona's Earl was already established by the kings of Aragon in the fourteenth century. In the fifteenth century, early versions of the legend appeared. This versions explained the creation of this heraldic sign as some blood marks on a golden shield. Finally, in the sixteenth century it was Beuter who noticed that he had found the legend of Wilfred the Hairy and the blood bars in some alleged \\"manuscripts\\" he gave no further data from. Although it cannot be imputed with absolute certainty that Beuter was the creator of the legend, it seems rather clear that the alleged \\"manuscript\\" source was either remitting to an earlier source, or it was a subterfuge to avoid any subsequent critique. The Valencian Legend of the Four Blood Bars was an immediate and fulminating success that was copied by all the later historians that made it a true story. It was not until 1812 that the Catalan historian Joan de Sans i de Barutell discredited any truth in the Valencian legend of the four bars. He noted the historical incoherences regarding Wilfred the Hairy (840-897). Meanwhile, heraldic Faustino Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s proved that heraldic did not reach Europe until the second quarter of the twelfth century (1125-1150). Although in 1812 Joan de Sans i de Barutell discredited completely the historicity of the legend, it is still a beautiful legend, which is why artists felt the need to graphically reproduce it and gloss it with poems. The Valencian Legend of the Four Blood Bars that appeared in the sixteenth century should not be confused with the Llegenda medieval de Guifr√© el Pil√≥s(Medieval legend of Wilfred the Hairy), compiled by the monks of Santa Maria de Ripoll Monastery in the twelfth century.  Background  The link between the Senyera Reial and the Earl Wilfred the Hairy dates back to the fourteenth century, when the King Peter the Ceremonious indicated that the Senyera Reial was originally from the Earls of Barcelona. That is how, in 1385 he ordered to put barred shields at the county graves of Girona's Cathedral, corresponding to Ramon Berenguer II i Ermessenda de Carcassona. Indeed, when the King wrote the Ordinacions de la Casa (Court Rules) he established that the Creu d'A√Ønsa (A√Ønsa Cross) was the shield of the old Aragon kings and not the Senyal Reial, which he considered from the lineage of the Earls of Barcelona. In this sense, in his Cr√≤niques dels reis d'Arag√≥ e comtes de Barcelona a miniature comes up representing Wilfred of Arri√†, mythical father of Wilfred the Hairy, who wears a barred shield. In this way, when the son of Peter IV of Aragon, Prince and future King John I of Aragon \\"the Haunter\\", asked in 1376 to Father James Dominic to write his genealogy and also his wife's in Genealogia regum Navarrae et Aragoniae et comitum Barchinonae (Genealogy of Barcelona's Earls). Once again, a miniature of Wilfred of Arri√† was finally included, wearing a shield with the Senyal Reial. Kings were so sure that the Senyal Reial belonged to the lineage of the Earls of Barcelona that they publicly expressed it. As Martin I of Aragon \\"the Human\\" and Alfonso V \\"the Magnanimous\\"F did. File:Cr√≤nica dels reys d'Arag√≥ e comtes de Barcelona BGUS ms 2664 f22v.jpg File:Genealogies dels comtes de Barcelona-sXV-09.jpg File:Cronica D¬¥Aragon-Palos de Aragon- Condes de Barcelona.jpg  Primary versions of the legend  Weapons from family Aguilar-Priego (after Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba) The Legend of the Four Blood Bars does not appear in its definitive version in any historical work before Beuter's work in 1551.Alcoberro i Pericay, Agust√≠. ¬´Mites i llegendes¬ª. Barcelona Quaderns d'Hist√≤ria, N√∫m. 9, 2003, p√†g. 135-148. . It was Beuter who warned about having found the legend \\"according to what I found written\\" in a supposed \\"personal manuscript\\". Even though one cannot impute the invention of the legend to Beuter with absolute security, it seems clear that the resource of the supposed \\"personal manuscript\\" either refers to a previous source or was subterfuged to avoid any subsequent criticism. Historian Agust√≠ Aloberro i Pericay points out that, in any case, whether he was the inventor of Beuter's legend or if the legend is an adaptation of an earlier version that circulated in Valencia, the \\"personal manuscript\\" would not be much prior to 1551. = Otger Catal√≥'s version and the blood bars of 1532 = Aragonese historian Gualberto Fabrico de Vagad, in his play Cr√≥nica de Arag√≥n (Chronicle of Aragon) (1499) explained again that the first king in Aragon who took the Royal Banner was Alfonso the Chaste, son of the Earl of Barcelona Ramos Berenguer IV, making it clear that they were \\"the canes of Catalonia\\". Historian Lucio Marineo S√≠culo expressed it in a similar way in his play De Aragoniae Regibus (1509), introducing the novelty that the emblem had its origin in the mythical Knight Otger Catal√≥.Albert√≠, Jordi. La bandera catalana: mil anys d'hist√≤ria. Raval Edicions SLU, P√≤rtic, 2010. . Lucio Marineo S√≠culo's play was translated into Spanish by Juan de Molina and printed in Valencia with the name of Cr√≥nica de Arag√≥n. Starting from this translation, Spanish historian Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s invented a primitive version of the legend of the four bars in his play Cat√°logo Real de Castilla (Castilla's royal Catalogue).Galdeano Carretero, Rodolfo. ¬´Historiografia i iconografia: la s√®rie ic√≤nica dels comtes de Barcelona del Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya (1587-1588)¬ª. Arxiu de Textos Catalans Antics, n¬∫. 25, 2006, p√†g. 375-409. . The Spanish historian explains that the Knight Otger Catal√≥ arms were a golden shield and, while he was fighting against the Saracens, when he wanted to reach his shield, five blood-stained fingers stack on it. When the battle ended, Otger Catal√≥ commanded that from that moment on that would be the shield of his successors. (Catalan) Encara que no s'esmenta ni a la cr√≥nica aragonesa ni a la de Catalunya, at√®s que ve al cas parlar d'aquestes armes, dir√© aqu√≠ all√≤ que he vist escrit i pintat en llibres d'armes antics. Respecte al m√©s antic, que √©s el nombre de cinc bastons, escriuen que lluitant contra els moros el dit Otger Catal√≥ portava un escut franc tot daurat i que fou ferit en una m√†. I aix√≠ com la tenia ensangonada, volent adre√ßar el dit escut o posar-lo en la seva voluntat, el senyal√† d'adalt a baix amb tots els cinc dits ensangonats i quedaren cinc l√≠nies o bastons de sang sobre el daurat escut. I ven√ßuda la batalla amb molta prosperitat man√† que l'escut aix√≠ es qued√©s i d'aleshores en endavant foren aquelles les seves armes i les dels seus successors. (English) Although it is not mentioned neither in the Chronicle of Aragon nor in the Chronicle of Catalonia, in view of the fact that it is relevant to talk about these arms, I will say here what I have seen written and painted in books about old coats of arms. Regarding the oldest one, which has five bars, it is written that fighting against the Moors the said Otger Catal√≥ wore a golden shield and he was wounded in a hand. And even if he had it all bloody, he wanted to reach the named shield or put it near him. Then he stained it all with all his bloody five fingers from top to bottom and there were five lines or canes of blood on the golden shield. When he won the battle with great prosperity he ordered to maintain the shield as it was. From then on, that would be his coat of arms and the arms of his successors. Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s: Cat√°logo Real de Castilla (1532). The Catalan historian and archiver Pere Miquel Carbonell denied any historical background of the legendary Knight Otger Catal√≥ in his work Chr√≤niques de Espanya fins ac√≠ no divulgades (Unrevealed Chronicles of Spain) (1513), which was printed in 1547. Finally, in 1551 the first version of the legend written in 1532 focusing in Otger Catal√≥ was adapted by the Valencian historian Pere Antoni Beuter, who published it in his work Segunda parte de la cr√≥nica general de Espa√±a(Second Party of the Spanish General Chronicle), a chronicle that was published in Spanish in Valencia, in the year 1551. The Valencian historian changed the legendary Knight Otger Catal√≥ for the historical Earl Wilfred the Hairy, the Saracen people for the Normans, and the accidental mark of the bloody fingers above the golden shield for an epic formal concession from the Emperor of the Franks to the Earl of Barcelona; in this way, the definitive version of Legend of the Four Blood Bars was established.  Legend of the Four Blood Bars  Badge with the Senyal Reial When in the Segunda parte de la cr√≥nica general de Espa√±a it is time to explain the facts of Wilfred the Hairy, the Earl of Barcelona, Beuter the episode of the Legend of the Four Blood Bars is added.Darna, Leticia. ¬´Una aproximaci√≥n a la Her√°ldica civil y eclesi√°stica en el burgo de la Corona de Arag√≥n¬ª.

Beuter explains that the Normans attacked France and Earl Wilfred the Hairy went to help the Frank Emperor. Once the Normans were defeated, the Earl Wilfred the Hairy asked Emperor Louis ‚Äîit is not certain which Louis it was, if it was Louis I (814-840), Louis II (877-879), or Louis III (879-882)‚Äî to give him a coat of arms. Following his petition, the king got close to him and wet his right-hand fingers in an injury that the Earl had, sweeping them top to bottom above the Earl's golden shield and he said: \\"This will be your coat of arms, Earl\\". (Catalan) En aquest succ√©s, els normands entraren per la terra de Fran√ßa, i l'emperador Llu√≠s necessit√† de gent per a resistir-los. An√† a servir-lo el comte amb els cavallers barcelonins que amb ell es trobaven. I lluitaren amb els normands valerosament i els venceren. En aquesta batalla, segons he trobat escrit en uns quaderns de m√†, es diu que el comte Guifr√© el Pel√≥s deman√† a l'emperador Llu√≠s que li don√©s armes que pogu√©s portar a l'escut, que portava daurat sense cap divisa. I l'emperador, veient que havia estat en aquella batalla tant valer√≥s que, malgrat les ferides, f√©u meravelles amb les armes, s'acost√† a ell, i mull√† la m√† dreta de la sang que li sortia al comte, i pass√† els quatre dits ensangonats per sobre de l'escut daurat, de dalt a baix, fent quatre ratlles de sang, i digu√©: Aquestes seran les vostres armes, comte. I d'all√≠ prengu√© les quatre ratlles, o bandes, de sang en camp daurat, que son les armes de Catalunya, que ara en diem d'Arag√≥.¬ª‚Äî Pere Antoni Beuter: Segunda parte de la cr√≥nica general de Espa√±a (1150). (English) In this particular event, the Normans entered France, and Emperor Louis needed people to fight them back. The Earl went to serve him with the knights from Barcelona who were with him. And they fought bravely against the Normans and they defeated them. In this battle, according to what I have found written in some scripts, it is said that Earl Jofre Valer√≥s asked Emperor Louis to give him a coat of arms he could carry on his golden shield, that until that moment carried no insignia. And the Emperor, realizing that he had been so brave in that battle where, in spite of the injuries, he had done wonderful things, got close to him, and wet his right-hand on the blood that sprouted from the Earl, and he swiped the four bloody fingers above the golden shield from top to bottom, making four lines of blood, and he said: \\"This will be your coat of arms, Earl. And there he made the four lines, or stripes, of blood in a golden field, the coat of arms of Catalonia which are currently used today by Aragon.\\" ‚Äî Pere Antoni Beuter: Segunda parte de la cr√≥nica general de Espa√±a (1550).

Our new site will be the Internet's first transparent search engine, and the first one that carries the reputation of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.\\" The new search engine was not expected to immediately replace a general purpose search engine because at first it would only draw on information from Wikipedia and its other free knowledge projects, though it might in time also include academic and open access sources in its search results. Matt Southern in Search Engine Journal attributed media confusion about the Knowledge Engine's scope to the fact that this was \\"quite a contrast to the original grant application documents\\". The project was not discussed publicly with the Wikipedia community while developing the concept, nor part of the existing annual plan. This secrecy was mirrored by a degree of confusion within the organization, and seen as at odds with the goal of transparency. An initial blogpost by WMF Executive Director Lila Tretikov about the project did not address why the original proposal was so much broader than an internal search engine. Some staff and WMF board members felt the WMF was still not being straightforward with the Wikipedia community. This led to a crisis for the organization, leading to Tretikov's resignation in February 2016. Design The goal of the Knowledge Engine was to let readers and editors be less reliant on proprietary search engines when looking for new information. The project proposal asked, \\"Would users go to Wikipedia if it were an open channel beyond an encyclopedia?\\" Example of federated data sources potentially used by the Knowledge Engine. The Knowledge Engine was designed to be open and transparent about how a piece of information originates and allow access to metadata. It would have no advertisements, protect user privacy, and emphasize community building and sharing of information. It would draw information from Wikipedia-related projects and may eventually search other sources of public information such as the U.S. Census Bureau, OpenStreetMap, the Digital Public Library of America, and external sources like Fox News. Jimmy Wales and the WMF stated that the project would focus on improving search on Wikipedia and related Wikimedia projects. The grant application stated that it would \\"create a model for surfacing high quality, public information on the internet.\\" It also advised that \\"commercial search engines dominate search-engine use of the internet\\" and states that \\"Google, Yahoo, or another big commercial search engine could suddenly devote resources to a similar project, which could reduce the success of the project.\\" = Development timeline = Information about the project became public only gradually. As early as May 2015, community members asked about the concentration of staff in a new \\"Search and Discovery\\" department, though public plans made little or no reference to this work. The grant was applied for in mid-2015 and awarded in September, but only publicly announced in a January 2016 press release. The project plan had four stages, each scheduled to take about 18 months: Discovery, Advisory, Community and Extension. The initial stage of the project was budgeted to cost $2.5 million, with the whole running to the tens of millions. After a year, the WMF was to evaluate development to date, and at the close of the grant, set plans for the project to continue to the second stage. Motivation and scope Since mid-2012, Google Search has included fast facts from Wikipedia articles on its search results pages via the Google Knowledge Graph. A central source of confusion for the project was the extent to which it would directly compete with traditional search engines as a place to search the Web. According to Vice, \\"the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that finances and founded Wikipedia, is interested in creating a search engine that appears squarely aimed at competing with Google.\\" According to The Guardian, \\"there was considerable doubt over what the tool was actually intended to be: a search engine aimed at halting a decline in Wikipedia traffic sent by Google, or simply a service for searching within Wikipedia?\\" Since 2012, Google Search and other search engines had started highlighting brief informational summaries from Wikipedia in knowledge panels alongside search results, reducing traffic to Wikipedia from those search engines. According to Search Engine Watch, this led to a battle for attention, and this project could have recouped some of that traffic. Leaked internal documents from early concepts framed the plan more boldly than the its final public description. They said the \\"Knowledge Engine By Wikipedia will democratize the discovery of media, news and information‚Äîit will make the Internet's most relevant information more accessible and openly curated, and it will create an open data engine that's completely free of commercial interests. Our new site will be the Internet's first transparent search engine, and the first one that carries the reputation of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.\\" The apparent contradiction between different descriptions of the purpose led to confusion in the media and in the community. In response to speculation, the WMF published a response clarifying its intentions: \\"We're not building a global crawler search engine ... Despite headlines, we are not trying to compete with other platforms, including Google. As a non-profit we are noncommercial and support open knowledge. Our focus is on the knowledge contributed on the Wikimedia projects. ... We intend to research how Wikimedia users seek, find, and engage with content. This essential information will allow us to make critical improvements to discovery on the Wikimedia projects.\\" Director of Discovery Tomasz Finc added \\"we are building an internal search engine, and we are not building a broad one. Jimmy Wales stated that suggestions that the WMF is creating a rival to Google are \\"trolling\\", \\"completely and utterly false\\", and \\"a total lie\\". while allowing that the Knowledge Engine might in time include academic and open access sources in its search results. Matt Southern in Search Engine Journal attributed media confusion about the KE's scope to the fact that this was \\"quite a contrast to the original grant application documents\\", an assessment echoed by James Vincent in The Verge, Matt McGee in Search Engine Land, and Jason Koebler in Vice. Controversy Large-scale WMF projects are almost always discussed publicly with the Wikipedia community, but this did not happen with the Knowledge Engine development. Wikipedians were unaware of the existence of the project as a concept, and the KE project was not mentioned in the WMF's annual plan. According to the English Wikipedia's community newsletter, The Signpost, some community members expressed outrage at the perceived secrecy around it and their lack of ability to give input, and this raised questions about WMF's commitment to transparency with the Wikipedia community. James Heilman, a member of the WMF's Board of Trustees, noted in The Signpost that while on the Board, he had insisted multiple times that the grant documentation be made public, without success. He was dismissed from the Board in December 2015, and it was suggested that his push for transparency concerning the grant had been a factor in his dismissal‚Äîa suggestion rejected by Jimmy Wales. The Wikipedia community re-elected Heilman to the Board in 2017. Ruth McCambridge said in Nonprofit Quarterly, \\"Wikipedia editors have been requesting from December for the grant proposal and grant letter for a project that many surmise is a bid to remain technologically cutting-edge by the Wikimedia Foundation, but which may divert resources and attention from other pressing needs of the community.\\" Commenting on the reluctance to share the grant documents with the community, referencing privacy concerns, McCambridge saw \\"a major difference in culture and values assumptions\\" compared to previous Wikimedia practice. McCambridge said that \\"the power of important strategic decisions\\" here seemed to rest \\"between funders and the top of the organizational hierarchy\\" and was \\"not shared with volunteer editors.\\" The WMF initially published only portions of the grant documentation, later making the full grant agreement available in February. Further internal documents were leaked shortly after. The full agreement clarified the initial concept for the first stage of the project. Tretikov said she regretted being so late in informing the Wikipedia editing community about the grant. Longtime Wikipedia editor and journalist William Beutler told Vice Magazine's Jason Koebler, \\"Leaving aside whether a search engine is a good idea, let alone feasible, the core issue here is about transparency. The irony is that the Wikimedia Foundation failed to observe one of the movement's own core values ....\\" UK Wikipedia editor Ashley van Haeften told Ars Technica via e-mail that \\"Lila, Jimmy, and the rest chose to keep the project and the Knight Foundation application and grant a secret until the projects were underway for six months, and even then this only came to light because it was leaked.\\" Tretikov's initial public post about the Knowledge Engine project did not explain why the original grant proposal had such a grander vision than the later public plan to develop an internal search engine. Staff who had been uncomfortable about the project's development felt the WMF was not being sufficiently straightforward with the community. According to statements posted of an internal meeting on the WMF's website, a member of the Discovery team member said to Tretikov, \\"My concern is that we still aren't communicating it clearly enough. This morning's blog post is the truth, but not all of the truth. Namely that we had big plans in the past. It would have been much easier to say that we did have big plans, but they were ditched ... we still haven't acknowledged it. We can't deny it.\\" Former Deputy Director of the WMF Erik M√∂ller, up to April 2015, portrayed the events as \\"very much out of control\\" and \\"a crisis.\\" Disagreements about the project, and the response to the resulting controversy, led to many WMF staff members departing, culminating in Tretikov resigning on February 25, 2016.

The following year, 1978, Wickens gained an Arved Kurtz Prize for Violin Playing, the Beethoven Violin Prize, another Leonard Smith Prize for Violin and Piano Duo, as well as the Kantrovitch Prize for Solo Strings. Following his education Wickens began playing around small venues in London, and worked with a number of acts including Steve Knightly's band, Short Stories, and the English acoustic roots and folk duo Show of Hands. Wickens first met Steve Harley in 1982, during which time Wickens was in Short Stories. In 1984, Wickens joined Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel as violinist and guitarist. Wickens' debut performance with the band was at London's Camden Palace in 1984. This show was professionally filmed and released on VHS under the name \\"Live from London\\". Although the band wouldn't go on tour again until the 'Comeback: All is Forgiven' tour of 1989, Wickens would continue to tour with the band until the early-1990s. The Brighton and Northampton concerts of the 1989 tour were also professionally filmed, and the footage edited to create a VHS titled \\"Steve Harley + Cockney Rebel: Live\\". He was involved in the recording of Harley's solo album Yes You Can, which was released in 1992. He performed on and co-wrote the track \\"Victim of Love\\", and also played violin on \\"Promises\\" and \\"The Lighthouse\\". Wickens left the band in 1992, and was replaced by Nick Pynn. In 1989, Wickens had become a member of the pop band Immaculate Fools, who had achieved a couple of minor hits in the UK. During the late 1980s the band underwent a major line-up change, when Wickens joined the group along with three other new musicians. He recorded, co-produced, co-wrote and toured with the group, and during his time with the band released the albums Another Man's World (1990), The Toy Shop (1992), Woodhouse (1995) and Kiss and Punch (1996). In 1997 Wickens formed the music production company Hydraphonic - a partnership project with Immaculate Fools' guitarist, Brian Betts. Using their writing, recording and production skills, the company has served various advertising agencies and publishers such as Sony/ATV, Universal Music and Sonoton. During the 1990s, he co-founded the contemporary Irish trio, Clann na Mara, alongside Paul Gillieron and J Eoin. Around the same time Wickens and Brian Aldwinckle formed the folk duo The MacNamaras. After leaving Immaculate Fools in 1998, Wickens returned as a key member of Cockney Rebel. He has remained with the group since, performing as part of the full rock band line-up as well as the three-man acoustic shows. With the band he has performed at the Glastonbury Extravaganza, and the Isle of Wight Festival, as well as many of Europe's major rock festivals. The band's 2004 performance at Isle of Wight was released as a DVD in 2005. Wickens featured playing violin and guitar on five tracks from Harley's 2003 live album Acoustic and Pure: Live, Accessed on 26 July 2013. as well as all tracks on the 2004 live album Anytime! (A Live Set). He provided violin, guitar and backing vocals for Cockney Rebel's 2005 studio album The Quality of Mercy, as well as Harley's 2010 studio album Stranger Comes to Town. On the former album he helped co-write \\"Journey's End\\", and on the latter album co- wrote the lead single \\"Faith & Virtue\\" with Harley, and also received a writing credit on the track \\"Take the Men and the Horses Away\\". In 2018, Wickens released his debut solo album, Where Birdsong Meets Aeroplane, through his label Observation Records. Acclaim Wickens' violin playing has been highly praised.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. For a time, it housed the museum of the Pejepscot Historical Society. Description and history The Richardson House stands on the south side of Lincoln Street, just west of the town's business district. It is a two-story brick building, with a hip roof and a granite foundation. The roof cornice is broad and studded with irregularly spaced Italianate brackets, with a line of dentil moulding. The street-facing facade is three bays wide, all windows, with the Colonial Revival entrance set in a projection to the left, under a flat-roofed porch supported by square paneled pillars. The windows of the second floor are set in round-arch openings, with a shallow iron balcony extending across all three. The house was built in 1857 for George McManus, a master mariner who lived here until his death in 1864. It is one of the region's finest examples of transitional Greek Revival-Italianate design, but its architect is unknown. In the mid-20th century it was owned by the locally prominent Richardson family, and it served for a number of years as the parsonage for St. Paul's Episcopal Church.

The son of a Ming loyalist, Song was a high-flying Qing official and well-regarded poet. Regarded as one of the \\"eight great Qing-dynasty poets\\", he died in 1673 at age 59. Early life and career Song Wan was born in 1614 in Laiyang, Shandong, China. His father was a patriotic Ming official who killed himself following the decline of the dynasty. Song was described as a \\"filial\\" son and a conscientious learner. In 1649 he became a civil servant, albeit one under the Qing regime that his father detested, and rose in the ranks quickly. His career as a government official came to a pause after he was accused of working with conspirators during the 1661 Shandong Rebellion, also known as the Yu Qi Rebellion, while he was Chief Inquisitor of Zhejiang. He served three years in prison, along with his family. It was discovered that one of his relatives had reported him for treason; in light of that, Song was cleared of all charges in 1664. Song became Censor of Sichuan in 1672. Song Wan was also a prolific linguist. He was most interested in poetry and 1333 poems by Song are still in existence. The Library of Laiyang houses sixteen volumes of Song Wan poems, which is the largest such collection. Death and legacy 19th-century illustration of \\"Squirting\\" from Xiangzhu liaozhai zhiyi tuyong (Liaozhai Zhiyi with commentary and illustrations; 1886) A year after moving to Sichuan, in 1673, rebels led by Ming general Wu Sangui seized the capital Chengdu; Song, after being informed of this, \\"died of panic and fright\\". He was aged 59. Song Wan is considered to be one of the \\"eight great Qing-dynasty poets\\". His former residence in Laiyang is now a local museum. According to the museum director, Song was an incredibly popular poet whose works were \\"read by everyone\\", hailing him as a major inspiration to Chinese poetry. Chiang (2005) states that \\"Song Wan's life story (...) may be read of the impossibility of adhering to (Confucian ideals).\\" Song is one of the protagonists of the short story \\"Squirting\\" (Âô¥Ê∞¥; also known as \\"Spraying Water\\") by Pu Songling in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. The tale narrates the Song's maids' and mother's encounter with an elderly ghost who spouts water (squirts); the incident allegedly occurred when Song was working for the government and had to travel away from home.

The murders were apparently motiveless and remain unsolved.  The murders  On the morning of Thursday 25 July 1946, Mrs Jeanne Jugand, the 35-year-old neighbour of the Carterons, became concerned as she had not seen the family for several days. She went to their farm, which was 100 metres from her own house, and saw worrying signs through the window. Mrs Jugand's husband then alerted the mayor and the police in Ambrault. The prosecutor's office in Ch√¢teauroux requested the assistance of the judicial police in Limoges. Several senior police officers and inspectors were dispatched to the scene. A locksmith broke open the door. The scene inside resembled an execution. The bodies of Kl√©ber Carteron, his wife Alphonsine, their son Andr√© and another boy, Claude Godard, a ward of the state, were found face down with their arms and legs bound, all executed with a bullet to the back of the head. The family dog had also been killed in its basket.  Investigation  Six spent cartridges and two unspent ones were found at the crime scene. The police's report emphasised the farm's relatively isolated location, described the three rooms and mentioned: \\"The door to the room where the crime was committed was locked. The key had been removed and could not be found. [...] The window had a smashed pane...\\" Despite the disorder in the room and the fact that the cupboards had been ransacked, there were no signs of a struggle. Detectives were initially unable to determine the type of weapon that had fired the bullets. A gunsmith could only confirm that the six cartridges came from the same weapon. It was not until two years later that it was established that the weapon had been a Sten sub-machine gun. A motive of robbery seemed unlikely because the family were very poor. For a while, the authorities investigated a theory that the crime was committed by a legionnaire acquaintance of Kl√©ber Carteron who was inflicting personal revenge. However, this theory was dismissed as the legionnaire had been in Algeria at the time of the murders. With nothing else to go on, the investigators were left to rely on questioning the local population. Local working-class people were reluctant to talk to the authorities. Several theories were suggested but yielded no leads. New evidence arose when a farm worker, employed along with Kl√©ber Carteron at the Ferme des Paisseaux farm, stated that Carteron had been scared the previous winter. On two separate occasions, Carteron confided in his colleague that he had been followed along the track that led to his home. A few hundred metres away, close to a public forest, a bag was found which belonged to Carteron and contained a schoolbook. Eleven days later, a lumberjack came across a makeshift shelter in the forest. This made it possible to establish a link between the crime scene, the place where the bag was found and the shelter, all of which were located within a few fields' distance of each other. At the same time, a local rumour was circulating. Some believed that Kl√©ber Carteron, who enjoyed poaching in his spare time, had surprised members of the French Resistance who were appropriating a piece loot that had been airdropped into the forest during the Second World War. A Sten sub-machine gun was a weapon commonly used by the Resistance. However, no concrete evidence was found to support this theory, which also lacked an explanation for why the resistance members would later have gone to Carteron's house to kill the whole family, instead of just killing him on the spot. In April 1947, a final report from Superintendent Daraud closed the case for the time being, without being able to find a motive or a suspect.  New investigation  In 1948, the investigation was left in the hands of the Orl√©ans police department, led by Ren√© Rolland. A Sten sub-machine gun was found at the home of a \\"Captain Jacques\\", an individual with a dubious local reputation. During the war, he had led a network of Resistance fighters, known as the Arm√©e secr√®te (\\"Secret Army\\"), in the Issoudun region. A professor specializing in weapons confirmed that a Sten had fired the bullets but, for some reason, the professor was never shown the weapon found in the possession of \\"Captain Jacques\\". It is still unknown whether any ballistic analysis was ever carried out. With this, the investigation was once again closed in December 1948. Among the local population today, a personal dispute between Kl√©ber Carteron and the unknown killer is the theory given most credit. It is widely acknowledged that the investigation had many shortcomings and not all the details were examined thoroughly, or at all. This has been attributed to the general turmoil and lack of stability in French society immediately after the end of the Second World War.

The FACT-G is the original questionnaire that led to the development of the larger Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) collection of quality of life instruments. The survey assesses the impacts of cancer therapy in four domains: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional. The FACT-G is also offered with additional questions measuring cancer-specific factors that may affect quality of life, leading to the creation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H&N;), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L), and 18 others.  History and development  The Fact-G was developed by Dr. David Cella, now president and Chief Scientific Officer of FACIT.org and Chair of the Department of Medical Social Sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. It was developed to assess the quality of life in cancer patients undergoing clinical trials for cancer therapy. Dr. Cella argues for the value of quality of life measures in general because \\"implicitly, the relief of a symptom is valued because of its associated benefit to patient function and well-being. Explicitly, it is essential to determine whether any supportive-care intervention is producing a benefit that outweighs its cost.\\" Since development began in 1987, the initial 33-item Fact-G published in 1993 has undergone multiple revisions, with the latest version (Fact-G Version 4) \\"designed to enhance clarity and precision of measurement\\" through \\"formatting simplification, item-reduction, and rewording,\\" resulting in the 27-item scale used today. In addition to revisions and refinement, the FACT-G has been translated into over 60 languages.  Structure and scoring  The FACT-G Version 4 has 27 questions, each of which is answered using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state, leading to some items being reverse-scored. Questions measure the respondents' health state over the last 7 days in four subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 questions), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 questions), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 questions), and Functional Well-being (FWB, 7 questions). Disease-specific versions of the FACT-G contain these four core subscales, with additional questions appended to address disease-specific factors. Scoring the FACT-G is performed through a simple sum of item scores. Each subscale is scored, and a total score for the FACT-G is obtained by adding each of the subscale scores. With a total possible score greater than 100, additional scoring methods have been used to simplify interpretation. Modifications of scoring include normalizing the total score on a scale of 0-100 through mathematical transformations, as well as the use of a Trial Outcome Index (TOI). The Trial Outcome Index is a simple sum of the Physical Well-Being and Functional Well- Being, and is intended as a summary index of functional status to be used as a clinical trails endpoint.  Current usage  The FACT-G is one of the most widely used patient-reported outcomes measures in cancer research along with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), according to a 2011 systematic review comparing the two instruments. The authors suggest that researchers interested in the financial impact and physical symptoms of cancer treatment use the EORTC QLQ-C30, while those interested in health-related quality of life or with limited sample sizes use the FACT-G. The review ultimately concludes that \\"Numerous studies have provided strong support for convergent and discriminant validity of both the QLQ-C30 and FACT-G\\" and provides an aid to \\"...clinical researchers in deciding which of the two questionnaires is the most appropriate for their purposes, driven by the outcomes that are of most interest.\\" Professional organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have embraced the FACT-G as a standard assessment of quality of life in cancer clinical trials. The American Society of Clinical Oncology requested that the Food and Drug Administration define the FACT-G as the gold standard assessment of health-related quality of life in a proposed amendment to the Food and Drug Administration's \\"Guidance for Industry on Clinical Trail Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics\\" although, this amendment was not included in the May 2007 publication. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Group at the University of Oxford reported that the FACT-G is a promising patient-reported outcome measurement that is worth piloting in the National Health Service as a standard.http://phi.uhce.ox.ac.uk/pdf/CancerReviews/PROMs_Oxford_BreastCancer_012011.pdf Finally, The Cancer Institute NSW in Australia scored multiple quality of life instruments used in cancer care, and cited the FACT-G as \\"most appropriate in the cancer setting\\" when measuring health related quality of life in cancer patients.  Related scales  The creation of the FACT-G ultimately led to the development of the FACIT family of questionnaires for use in specific circumstances and additional diseases. There are over 20 cancer-specific scales such as the FACT-B for breast cancer and FACT-C for colorectal cancer and 27 symptom indexes which are short, 6 or 7 item subscales which focus only on symptoms. 12 treatment-specific measures focus on the quality of life impacts that patients receiving enteral feeding or with neurotoxicity experience. Finally, 13 non-cancer specific measures focus on topics beyond the impacts of disease and treatment, such as COST, which assesses financial impacts while the Facit-Sp measures spiritual well-being.

During the early 2000s they were the \\"sister club\\" of Dundalk F.C.. However, after winning the 2005 FAI Women's Cup and qualifying for the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Women's Cup, the club split into two separate teams. Dundalk City was re-established as an independent club while Dundalk W.F.C. became affiliated to the League of Ireland club and went on to compete in the UEFA Women's Cup. History =Early years= The club was originally formed in 1988 as Castletown Celtic Girls F.C. and they were initially based in the Fatima district of Dundalk. They were named after Castletown River. Their first manager was Niall Gallagher who later served as club chairman. Between 1988 and 1994 they played in the Dundalk League and from 1996 they also began to enter teams in the North Eastern League. In 1999 the club was relaunched as Dundalk City, they joined the Dublin Women's Soccer League and they effectively became the \\"sister club\\" of Dundalk F.C. while still remaining a separate entity. The new name was partly chosen to reflect Dundalk's ambitions to gain city status but also to distinguish the ladies team from the men's team. Under this arrangement, Dundalk City adopted the same club colours and club crest as the men's team and also began to play home games at Oriel Park. In 2000 City won both a DWSL Intermediate League title and the DWSL Intermediate Cup. They also subsequently gained promotion to the DWSL Premier Division. =Cup success= In 2003 City appointed Tommy Tasker as the team coach. Tasker was a former goalkeeper with Shelbourne, St James's Gate, Glenavon and Monaghan United. Tasker would subsequently turn City into a successful cup team. In October 2003 with a squad that included Grace Murray, City won the DWSL Premier Cup, beating a St James's Gate team featuring Katie Taylor. City defeated Gate in the final 3‚Äì2 after extra time. The final was played at the home of Bluebell United and City were presented with the trophy by future Republic of Ireland women's national football team manager Susan Ronan. In 2004 City reached the final of the FAI Women's Cup, but lost 4‚Äì1 to UCD. In 2005 City played in both the DWSL Premier Cup and FAI Women's Cup finals. In the former they lost 2‚Äì0 to UCD, however in the latter they defeated Peamount United 1‚Äì0. The all-important goal was scored by Sonia Hoey in the 16th minute. In the FAI Women's Cup final Katie Taylor once again featured for City's opponents. Both the FAI Women's Cup finals that City played in were staged at Lansdowne Road as part of double headers with the men's FAI Cup finals. =Split= In 2006 a split developed within Dundalk City over a plan for the club to fully merge with Dundalk F.C.. This effectively saw the emergence of two separate women's teams. Dundalk City, with Tommy Tasker as their coach, remained independent while Dundalk W.F.C. became affiliated with the League of Ireland club. After winning the 2005 FAI Women's Cup, Dundalk City had qualified for the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Women's Cup. However following complications that resulted from the split, it was Dundalk W.F.C. that went on to represent the Republic of Ireland in this competition. In subsequent seasons the two rival clubs both entered teams in the FAI Women's Cup and the Dublin Women's Soccer League. In June 2007 Stephanie Roche joined Dundalk City after having struck up a friendship with Grace Murray. Roche scored twice on her debut for Dundalk City in a 5‚Äì2 win over Benfica.

McLaine worked as a mechanic and joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) in 1912. He became secretary of the Manchester No.2 branch in 1916. Opposed to World War I, he joined the British Socialist Party (BSP) and was elected to its central committee in 1918. During this period, McLaine worked with William Leonard and John Maclean in running classes for the Scottish Labour College. McLaine attended the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern, along with Sylvia Pankhurst, Marjory Newbold, Willie Gallacher and others, in McLaine's case representing the BSP which shortly afterwards became part of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Whilst in Moscow McLaine was appointed to the Provisional International Bureau of Kultintern. McLaine remained active as an educationalist with the Plebs League and later the National Council of Labour Colleges (NCLC) publishing a series of articles called \\"Economics without Headaches\\". These articles were subsequently published as a book, An Outline of Economics. However, McLaine did not achieve prominence in the new party, and resigned from it in 1929, later becoming actively anti-communist. During the Second World War the NCLC decided they wanted a postal course to train shop stewards. McLaine drafted the course for them. In 1950 the AEU approached the NCLC as regards running a course on Industrial Management. James Millar, General Secretary of the NCLC immediately agreed, even though he wasn't sure how the course would be delivered. He contacted Frank Chapple, Nancy Hewitt, Billy Hughes and William McLaine who worked together as a team to deliver the course.

The most significant manifestation is bilateral, diffuse uveitis, which affects the eyes. VKH may variably also involve the inner ear, with effects on hearing, the skin and the meninges of the central nervous system.  Signs and symptoms  = Overview = Uveitis with poliosis of the eyelashes The disease is characterised by bilateral diffuse uveitis, with pain, redness and blurring of vision. The eye symptoms may be accompanied by a varying constellation of systemic symptoms, such as auditory (tinnitus, vertigo, and hypoacusis), neurological (meningismus, with malaise, fever, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, stiffness of the neck and back, or a combination of these factors; meningitis, CSF pleocytosis, cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, transverse myelitis and ciliary ganglionitis), and cutaneous manifestations, including poliosis, vitiligo, and alopecia. The vitiligo often is found at the sacral region. = Phases = The sequence of clinical events in VKH is divided into four phases: prodromal, acute uveitic, convalescent, and chronic recurrent. The prodromal phase may have no symptoms, or may mimic a non-specific viral infection, marked by flu-like symptoms that typically last for a few days. There may be fever, headache, nausea, meningismus, dysacusia (discomfort caused by loud noises or a distortion in the quality of the sounds being heard), tinnitus, and/or vertigo. Eye symptoms can include orbital pain, photophobia and tearing. The skin and hair may be sensitive to touch. Cranial nerve palsies and optic neuritis are uncommon. The acute uveitic phase occurs a few days later and typically lasts for several weeks. This phase is heralded by bilateral panuveitis causing blurring of vision. In 70% of VKH, the onset of visual blurring is bilaterally contemporaneous; if initially unilateral, the other eye is involved within several days. The process can include bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis, variable degree of vitritis, thickening of the posterior choroid with elevation of the peripapillary retinal choroidal layer, optic nerve hyperemia and papillitis, and multiple exudative bullous serous retinal detachments. The convalescent phase is characterized by gradual tissue depigmentation of skin with vitiligo and poliosis, sometimes with nummular depigmented scars, as well as alopecia and diffuse fundus depigmentation resulting in a classic orange-red discoloration (\\"sunset glow fundus\\") and retinal pigment epithelium clumping and/or migration. The chronic recurrent phase may be marked by repeated bouts of uveitis, but is more commonly a chronic, low-grade, often subclinical, uveitis that may lead to granulomatous anterior inflammation, cataracts, glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Full-blown recurrences are, however, rare after the acute stage is over. Dysacusia may occur in this phase.  Cause  Although there is sometimes a preceding viral infection, or skin or eye trauma, the exact underlying initiator of VKH disease remains unknown. However, VKH is attributed to aberrant T-cell-mediated immune response directed against self- antigens found on melanocytes. Stimulated by interleukin 23 (IL-23), T helper 17 cells and cytokines such as interleukin 17 (IL-17) appear to target proteins in the melanocyte.  Risk factors  Affected individuals are typically 20 to 50 years old. The female to male ratio is 2:1. By definition, there is no history of either surgical or accidental ocular trauma. VKH is more common in Asians, Latinos, Middle Easterners, American Indians, and Mexican Mestizos; it is much less common in Caucasians and in blacks from sub- Saharan Africa. VKH is associated with a variety of genetic polymorphisms that relate to immune function. For example, VKH has been associated with human leukocyte antigens (HLA) HLA-DR4 and DRB1/DQA1, copy-number variations (CNV) of complement component 4, a variant IL-23R locus and with various other non- HLA genes. HLA-DRB1*0405 in particular appears to play an important susceptibility role. Diagnosis If tested in the prodromal phase, CSF pleocytosis is found in more than 80%, mainly lymphocytes. This pleocytosis resolves in about 8 weeks even if chronic uveitis persists. Functional tests may include electroretinogram and visual field testing. Diagnostic confirmation and an estimation of disease severity may involve imaging tests such as retinography, fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound. For example, indocyanine green angiography may detect continuing choroidal inflammation in the eyes without clinical symptoms or signs. Ocular MRI may be helpful and auditory symptoms should undergo audiologic testing. Histopathology findings from eye and skin are discussed by Walton. The diagnosis of VKH is based on the clinical presentation; the diagnostic differential is extensive, and includes (among others) sympathetic ophthalmia, sarcoidosis, primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma, posterior scleritis, uveal effusion syndrome, tuberculosis, syphilis, and multifocal choroidopathy syndromes. = Types = Based on the presence of extraocular findings, such as neurological, auditory and integumentary manifestations, the \\"revised diagnostic criteria\\" of 2001 classify the disease as complete (eyes along with both neurological and skin), incomplete (eyes along with either neurological or skin) or probable (eyes without either neurological or skin) . By definition, for research homogeneity purposes, there are two exclusion criteria: previous ocular penetrating trauma or surgery, and other concomitant ocular disease similar to VKH disease.  Management  The acute uveitis phase of VKH is usually responsive to high- dose oral corticosteroids; parenteral administration is usually not required. However, ocular complications may require a subtenon or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids or bevacizumab. In refractory situations, other immunosuppressives such as cyclosporine, or tacrolimus, antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or infliximab may be needed.  Outcomes  Visual prognosis is generally good with prompt diagnosis and aggressive immunomodulatory treatment. Inner ear symptoms usually respond to corticosteroid therapy within weeks to months; hearing usually recovers completely. Chronic eye effects such as cataracts, glaucoma, and optic atrophy can occur. Skin changes usually persist despite therapy.  Eponym  VKH syndrome is named for ophthalmologists Alfred Vogt from Switzerland and Yoshizo Koyanagi and Einosuke Harada from Japan. Several authors, including the Arabic doctor Mohammad-al-Gh√¢fiq√Æ in the 12th century as well as Jacobi, Nettelship and Tay in the 19th century, had described poliosis, neuralgias and hearing disorders. This constellation was probably often due to sympathetic ophthalmia but likely included examples of VKH. Koyanagi's first description of the disease was in 1914, but was preceded by Jujiro Komoto, Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Tokyo, in 1911.

Mullen (born October 4, 1943) is a deep-sea explorer who is notable for extensive technological and research contributions to the world of underwater exploration.  Military career  Craig Mullen was a Navy diving officer during the Vietnam War and served in the Navy's Deep Submergence Program Office and as the Director of Operations at the Navy's Supervisor of Diving, Salvage and Ocean Engineering. Mullen served two tours in Vietnam, finishing his naval service directing the missing in action search for air crews lost at sea off the coast of Vietnam. He led a team of civilian technicians and divers in searching for remains among the aircraft wreckage located by sonar.  Professional career  In 1974, Mullen joined Alcoa Marine, a subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of America, as the Vice President of Operations. He directed the operations of the company's state-of-art deep ocean research vessel R/V Alcoa Seaprobe, which provided the first photos of the USSMonitor off Cape Hatteras, South Carolina. The Seaprobe, an all- aluminum vessel built specifically for deep ocean research and recovery, had a unique search pod utilizing experimental sonar and state-of-the-art cameras to sweep the ocean floor and transmit sonar and image data the ship, which was up to three miles above. In 1980 he was part of a management buy-out that acquired Alcoa's interests in ALCOA Marine, Inc. He initially served as its Vice President of Operations and later as President and a member of its Board of Directors. The newly acquired firm was renamed Eastport International and was a world leader in deep ocean technology development and operations. Eastport set private sector depth records for successful undersea operations in water depths in excess of 5,000 meters as early as 1991. Eastport was the Navy's choice to support its deep ocean search and recovery needs for over 20 years, and played a key role in projects including the recovery of the space shuttle Challenger,Ocean Industry D.W & V.E.

Eastport was also an early leader in the development of robotic technology now used by international telecommunications firms to install and service subsea fiber optic telecommunications/data cables and adapted for theme park usage. Eastport also designed and built the Jaws ride for Universal Studios and later, multiple water placed dinosaur action- animatronics in the Islands of Adventure ride, taking its engineering skills in an entirely new direction. In 1993 Mullen negotiated a merger between Eastport and Oceaneering International, Inc.,Oceaneering International, Inc. a major publicly-traded, international oilfield services company with growing government business, and remained the President of a newly formed subsidiary, Oceaneering Advanced Technologies (OTECH) Group. The new subsidiary contained all of Oceaneering's non-oilfield businesses including US Navy search and recovery, Space Systems, Environmental Services, Marine Construction and Ocean Cable Operations. Mullen led Oceaneering Technologies for over five years, diversifying its business base and growing revenues. In 1998 Mullen formed Sconset Marine, and was active in assisting technology start-up companies manage business development, raising capital, and guide technology development.  Research work  In 2003 Mullen co-founded the AURORA Trust FoundationAURORA Trust Foundation to advance the world's understanding of the ocean environment and its submerged cultural heritage. AURORA is active in the Mediterranean, discovering numerous ancient shipwreck sites. In 2004, Mullen co-founded the venture firm HLP-Capital to invest in international business opportunities, primarily in the Mediterranean, in the process also creating two new marine companies, Deep Blue SurveysDeep Blue Surveys (engaged in hydrographic surveys) and Deep Blue Ship Charters (active in the luxury yacht industry). Mullen has traveled and published widely, and has worked in most of the counties bordering the Mediterranean Sea from Lebanon to Spain. He is at ease working at the executive and high levels of government.

He grew up in Peru and Mexico, and it was in Mexico City where he first became aware of the contrast of wealth and poverty around him, which started him on a path of dedication to social justice. In 1976, Dar and his family returned to Israel and from 1979 - 1982, he completed his mandatory service as a paratrooper. During this time Dar had an insight that fundamentally changed his thinking about borders and humanity and how labels define and separate people, which is often referred to as the \\"sock sharers story.\\" Career In 1988 Dar joined Aladdin Knowledge Systems, a software company based in Tel Aviv.

Life Emil Walter was born to a protestant couple in Winterthur, already becoming a centre for the burgeoning Swiss railway industry, and a major industrial town more generally. Emil's father, Albert Walter, was a secondary school teacher originally from Munich, who as a young man had participated actively in the uprisings of 1848. The boy grew up in an orphanage in the town, and went on to attend the teacher- training academy at nearby K√ºsnacht between 1887 and 1891. One of his fellow students was Marie H√ºni whom he would later marry. After a further period of study in Z√ºrich, between 1895 and 1903 he worked as a secondary school teacher in Winterthur. In 1903 he co-founded the \\"Winterthurer Arbeiterzeitung\\" (\\"Winterthur Workers' Newspaper\\"), working as the newspaper's editor till 1909. In 1896 Walter married the trades union and feminist activist Marie H√ºni. Between 1898 and 1903 Emil Walter served as a town councillor in Winterthur, and from 1902 till 1920 he served as a councillor at the cantonal level. He worked as a part-time council employee between 1903 and 1910 with responsibilities involving the police service. Between 1908 and 1911 Walter edited Der Gr√ºtlianer, the newspaper of the old Gr√ºtli Union, originally a wide ranging workers' rights and welfare organisation which had become progressively more political and tentatively merged with the Swiss Social Democratic Party in 1901 (but would break away again and become a standalone political party in 1916). Within in the party at a national level, between 1912 and 1915 he was vice-president of the Gr√ºtli Union, also serving in 1916/17 as its president: in connection with his Gr√ºtli offices, he was in addition a member of the national leadership committee of the Social Democratic Party. Between 1911 and 1920 Walter combined his political duties with work as a secondary school teacher in Z√ºrich. Between 1920 and 1929 Walter was employed by the Cantonal (Z√ºrich region) council, in charge of finance and later, from 1923, in charge of building development. He also served as a director of the increasingly important Cantonal Electricity Company and of its successor, the Northeast Switzerland Power Company (Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke / NOK). Conclusion Emil Walter played an important role in the Winterthur labour movement until he was deselected on account of his attitude to the building workers' strike in 1909 and voted off the council in 1910. He was one of the leaders of the Gr√ºlianers while at the same time obtaining support from the \\"bourgeois\\" parties in elections. Walter also wrote for various publications to advocate introduction of proportional representation. Personal Emil Walter was married three times. His first marriage, to Marie H√ºni, ended in divorce in 1910, after which their two children were raised by Marie. One of those children was Emil Jakob Walter (1897-1984) who later achieved eminence as an academic (\\"Wissenschaftssoziologie\\"). Emil Walter's second marriage, in 1911, was to the primary school teacher Anna Schumacher. His third marriage, in 1930, was to Fanny Arnold.

History Mustafa was the son of Osman Pasha Bajalan. He never succeeded his father as hereditary governor of Zohab because the Persians conquered the Pashlik annexed it to Kermanshah. Mustafa's father Osman Pasha Bajalan after being overthrown in Zohab moved to Constantinople and then Mosul where Mustafa was born where after his education he entered the Ottoman civil service and took up the post of kaymakam of Al 'Aziziyah then Badrah and finally Khanaqin where his tribe still enjoyed influence because of its proximity to his ancestors former Pashlik and the number of Bajalan tribesmen who had followed their chief and settled in the town from across the Persian frontier. Mustafa was still head of the Bajalan tribe at turn of the 20th century but the family and tribe had been in decline with the loss of hereditary rule. Mustafa was described by civil administration of Mesopotamia as one of the most important political factors in the region. Ely Banister Soane a British political officer describes him a man with a harsh and determined character, he also notes that Mustafa was a Kurd to the backbone and was of pure descent, Soane also comments that 'Mustafa has a great reputation for dashing bravery in tribal fighting' and that he would be 'an energetic and enthusiastic instrument in any scheme for the autonomy of Kurdistan. It is also documented that Mustafa Pasha Bajlan was always anti- Turk and was at various times been in rebellion. The Ottoman government and Mustafa had been in constant friction with each other and as a result he had spent many years in exile in Constantinople. In total he was kept practically a prisoner by Abdul Hamed for 13 years, first in Constantinople and then in Baghdad. His contact and relationships with British officials alarmed the Turks and Arabs to the extent that he was called to Baghdad and placed under house arrest in 1912. Gertrude Bell describes Mustafa as being a Kurdish chief of high repute and notes \\"Did I ever tell you that Mustapha Pasha Bajlan (to whom you gave a silver pencil) died while I was in Cairo a heart attack. It's a great loss; he was a staunch supporter at Khaniqin [Khanaqin] and a very old friend of mine. I had a great affection for him. His wife has written me several letters - she is a delightful woman. Some time I must get up to Khaniqin to see her.\\" His tribe the Bajlan note the British, are half on the Turkish side and half Persian side of the frontier, he must be taken into account, the Turkish sections being under the influence of Mustafa Pasha, of Khaniqin, who is the most important political factor in that district. The autumn of 1917 allowed, finally, the installation of a British Political Officer at Khaniqin, after nine months of heart-rending petitions from Mustafa Pasha Bajlan and every class in the ruined countryside. Mustafa had a harem in which his two wives lived, one of which was Asma Khanum, the daughter of the last Baban prince Ahmed Pasha.

Flying later than its competitors, it was not selected and only one was built. Design The LeO H-27 was built in response to a French government call for a postal aircraft able to cover the South Atlantic routes. It was in competition with the Lat√©co√®re 300 and the Bl√©riot 5190. The design of the LeO H-27 was assisted by Lior√© at Olivier's experience with the LeO H-180 and LeO H-240 flying boats, the first single-engined and the second with one push-pull pair. It was a high wing cantilever monoplane with an all-metal wing in two parts, each with a thick airfoil, rectangular plan centre section and a trapezoidal outer panel with a rounded tip. The outer panel tapered in thickness outwards and carried span ailerons which, like the rear control surfaces, were balanced. The wing was built around two duralumin spars joined into a central box to which the leading and trailing edges were attached; all were dural covered. Four Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr water-cooled V-12 engines, each driving a three blade propeller, were mounted in two push-pull pairs, each pair mounted above the central panel on N-form, broad, faired struts assisted by two forward diagonal thrust struts and a near vertical pair aft. The LeO H-27 had a two step hull; its concave V reinforced underside had a central angle of 144¬∞. It was a flat sided structure built around longerons and frames. There was a mooring compartment in the extreme nose and in a second section the pilots' multiply-windowed cabin was also well forward and in front of the propeller discs. It had side-by-side seats with dual controls and was high up, with a navigator's cabin and radio equipment underneath, lit by portholes just forward of the port side crew entry door. The engineer's compartment was immediately behind the pilots. The mail was stored in a third, , section of the hull and the fourth housed equipment and four hammocks. At the rear a tall, straight edged fin mounted a narrow rectangular balanced rudder and also the high aspect ratio, parallel chord tailplane, positioned about halfway up the fin to keep it out of the spray and braced with a single strut on each side to the top of the hull. It had separate, narrow chord elevators. Lateral stability on the water was provided by two wing-mounted floats, with single step, V-form undersides. These were mounted below the central-outer wing panel junctions at only about one-quarter span on a combination of faired-in vertical and inward leaning struts. Development Though the hull of the LeO H-27 was first seen in public at the 12th Paris A√©ro Salon in November 1930, it did not fly until 30 December 1933, piloted by Bourdin. Only one was built and Air France's South Atlantic routes were flown instead by the Lat√©co√®re 300; the LeO H-27 did make at least one Atlantic crossing when Bourdin flew it to the Antilles towards the end of 1934.

Only one was built. Design and development Observation aircraft from World War I and into the 1920s generally had two crew, the pilot and a defensive gunner who was also the observer. Though there had been attempts to include three positions, separating the role of gunner and observer, the extra weight of the more powerful engine required proved too great a penalty. By the mid-1930s engine technology had improved enough, in Weymann's view, to make a three-seat aircraft fast enough. The W-100 was the result of this analysis. It was a two bay biplane with constant chord, unswept, unequal span wings with rounded tips. The wings were entirely wooden, with multiple spars and stressed plywood skin. The upper wing was significantly longer, broader and thicker than the lower and was in three parts, with a rectangular central portion that was mounted over the fuselage on two outward-leaning streamlined steel struts from the upper fuselage on each side. This section had no dihedral. The lower wings were mounted on the lower fuselage and braced to the upper wings with outward leaning N-form interplane struts; they had the same dihedral as the outer upper panels. Crossed wire bracing completed the strongly staggered structure. Servo-tabbed ailerons on upper and lower wings were linked with streamlined steel tubes. The W-100's fuselage frame was constructed from steel tube Warren girders, resulting in an essentially rectangular section structure which was largely fabric covered. There was a nine cylinder Hispano-Suiza 9Va radial engine (a licence-built Wright R-1820) in the nose under a long-chord cowling. The pilot's open cockpit was at the wing trailing edge, with the gunner's cockpit, fitted with a machine gun on a flexible mount, immediately behind. A triangular, upward hinged door in the starboard side below the gunner's cockpit gave access to the observer's position in the deepened forward fuselage between the pilot's cockpit and the engine. It had glazed panels in its top and bottom and entirely glazed sides, giving the observer clear views in all directions. At the rear the rectangular tailplane was built into the upper fuselage and carried larger area, separate, balanced elevators. The round edged fin was wire braced to the tailplane and carried a deep, round- topped rudder, also balanced. The W-100 had a fixed, wide track undercarriage, with each mainwheel on a V-form axle and drag strut hinged from the lower fuselage. A faired Messier oleo strut was attached to the upper fuselage. There was a small, steerable tailwheel. The Weymann W-100 first flew between late June and early July 1933, piloted by Barbot, though the location is not recorded. By August it had been further tested at Villacoublay, had returned to the factory by mid-August and was back at Villacoublay in September. There seem to be no further references to the W-100 in the French journals after this date.

It was discovered on 15 May 1985, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station in Arizona, United States. The likely elongated asteroid has a rotation period of 4.4 hours. It was named after planetary scientist Antti Penttil√§ at the University of Helsinki.  Orbit and classification  Penttil√§ is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì3.0 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,372 days; semi-major axis of 2.42 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 12¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation, a precovery taken at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in April 1970, or 15 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa Station.  Naming  This minor planet was named for Finnish postdoctoral researcher Antti Penttil√§ (born 1977) at the University of Helsinki, an expert on light reflection and absorption on the surface of small Solar System bodies such as asteroids and cometary nuclei, as well as of the cosmic dust released by cometary comae. The official was published on 12 July 2014 ().  Physical characteristics  The asteroid's spectral type has not been determined. Due to its low geometric albedo, it likely a carbonaceous C-type asteroid (see below). = Rotation period = In June 2015, a rotational lightcurve was obtained for this asteroid from photometric observations by astronomer Daniel Klinglesmith at Etscorn Campus Observatory , New Mexico. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.55 in magnitude (), indicative of a non-spherical, elongated shape. Previously, in August 2012, a concurring period of hours with an amplitude of 0.46 was determined from observations in the R-band by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory, California (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Penttil√§ measures between 7.9 and 9.6 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.04 and 0.085. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20, and hence calculates a smaller diameter of 4.9 kilometers.

The area was informally known as Cocata from the 1800s. Explorer John Charles Darke passed through the area on his 1844 expedition. A survey of the Cocata area in 1893 noted that \\"the land fit for agriculture was chiefly confined with a radius of one and a half miles of Mount Damper, Kolballa, Cocata, Ucontitchie and Pordia Hills, and consists of heavily-timbered mallee land with belts of pines, bushes and teatree, besides small grassy plans fringed with stunted wattle\\". It noted that there were soakage wells at Cocata Hill and at Koballa Hill, \\"each having a poor supply of fresh water\\", and that the soil was unfit for dams. It also reported that a track had been established from the Cocata area to the port at Venus Bay. Transport proved an early challenge, with local advocacy for improved roads and a railway to reduce the challenges of moving material. The name for the Hundred of Cocata, which was created on similar boundaries to the present locality, was approved by the Nomenclature Committee on 20 June 1928; it was surveyed into sections for pastoral selection soon after. The modern bounded locality was created in November 1999 in respect of the long-established name. In 1938, a weekly mail service to Cocata was introduced. The area had its own school for several decades from around the early 1920s; in 1926 it was referred to as one of \\"a number of South Australian schools with a roll call to which only six or seven students answer\\". Much of the southern section of the Cocata locality is taken up by the Cocata Conservation Park.

It was written by Paul Schw√§rzel and directed by Georg Woelz with Karl Sczuka composing the music and Heinz Goedecke providing the voice.Internet Movie Database, ‚ÄòDie Schlacht um Miggershausen‚Äô, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178015/, accessed 18 December 2015  Plot  The animation begins with an anthropomorphic house checking the date in his diary and starting an inventory of produce from several towns. The town of Miggershausen is producing less than anywhere else and so a radio with human characteristics starts checking a map for the location of this town in which we are shown images of a very run-down desolate place, the cow being milked only produces one drop of milk, the chicken's egg is so minuscule you need a magnifying glass to see it and the animals water trough is so contaminated it is doing the animals some serious harm. News of the inferiority of this town travels fast and we see a group of men in a pub reading the paper and laughing. The radio decides that something must be done and so he sets of on the very long journey, in which he has to take three modes of transport, to Miggershausen. The town's people are not very welcoming and the radio is confronted by a barking dog: a man drops a plant pot on his head: he gets a bucket of water in the face and finally he is thrown out by a pitchfork onto a rubbish heap. The radio decides he needs some assistance and so he sends a message by the airwaves to his fellow radios who answer his call for help. The army of radios make their journey to Miggershausen and come up with a plan to infiltrate the town. They disguise themselves as bushes and scarecrows to edge their way closer, then they finally enter the town through a tunnel they have dug and by using ladders to climb over the wall. When the convoy finally makes it into Miggershausen they raise a white flag (or more accurately a pair of white trousers) to show they now have control over the town. The head radio then gathers his army and assigns them all tasks at which they all go their separate ways beginning the reformative operation to make Miggershausen a more efficient town. The radios give the towns people advice on how to regenerate their land by making sure the cows are well-fed: the image of malnourished cows with their bones showing transforms into happy fatter cows who reward the people with an ongoing supply of milk; the chicken shed is refurbished; a dank dirty yard is replaced with fully functioning drainage system producing fresh water for everyone and fences are built in the fields so the animals can be separated with each space having its own fresh water trough. The chicken shed is also refurbished with a larger supply of chickens each are producing eggs to a good standard. A man is seen taking some advice from a radio and, taking it on board, rushes to get a cart full of hay safely into a shed before heavy rain follows. Upon completion the leader of the radio army stands on top of a platform and begins a speech to which all the town's people and all the animals listen intently. A man thanks the radio for his help and pulls out a purse full of money. What follows then is a series of clips of different people in the town relaxing in their homes, each accompanied by thought bubbles with different types of music playing. Then the town's people are gathered for a dance with the radio clapping along. The end of the animation shows the head radio painting over the town sign and replacing the name Miggershausen with Frohenhausen: froh being one of the German words for happy.Die Schlacht um Miggershausen (1937), at ‚ÄòYoutube‚Äô, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLMmVDprvrs, accessed 18 December 2015.  Background  When broadcasting was introduced in Germany in the early 1920s, those who wished to produce radio programs had to apply for a license which was granted by the Postal Ministry. Broadcasting was to differ from the two other popular forms of media; television and the press, in that it was to be ‚Äò‚Äôabove party politics‚Äô‚Äô.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 724. Those who wanted to become shareholders in radio programs could not be linked with or be part of any political parties and neither could anyone from a foreign land own shares to stop international influences within radio programs.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 724. Each radio company operating within their own region had total control on what was broadcast in their own area which minimised any competition. There was also a system in place that restricted the profits of any shareholders by having them sign over 51 percent of the company‚Äôs assets to the public authorities in exchange for a final operating license; the post office claiming the majority of these shares.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 726. This was done to prevent any private individual acquiring ‚Äò‚Äôunreasonable profits‚Äô‚ÄôKarl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 726. and so that broadcasting companies were closely connected to the public authorities, making German broadcasting both a ‚Äò‚Äôcapitalist business and a profit-restricted public enterprise‚Äô‚ÄôKarl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 726. or what is now known as a mixed economy. As the postal ministry acquired the majority of assets from the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft; a network of broadcasting companies in Germany, it is clear that the authorities owned and controlled most broadcasting companies in Germany from the beginning.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 726. Like those who were producing radio programs, those who were listening also needed a ‚Äò‚Äôlicense to install and operate a wireless receiver‚Äô‚Äô,Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 727. in addition to paying monthly fee of 2 Reichsmark. One Ministry official who had a great interest in broadcasting was Hans Bredow, a man who wanted to use broadcasting to promote ‚Äò‚Äôculture and education and . . . . social unity‚Äô‚ÄôKarl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), pp. 728. by entertaining the nation not just with music but with ‚Äò‚Äôconcerts, operas and lectures‚Äô‚Äô.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 729. These kinds of programs were mainly aimed at the lower-classes as a way to integrate them into the ‚Äò‚ÄôGerman Kulturnation‚Äô‚ÄôKarl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 729. and as an attempt to create a social unity across Germany. Of course there were several problems with this starting with the way the first radios were built as up until 1927 radios were complicated pieces of equipment that needed frequently tuning, with no loudspeaker: listeners had to use headsets, which would not have made for a very enjoyable or socially united experience. The design of the wireless changed after 1927 when the complicated wiring was hidden inside a wooden box and a loudspeaker was included making it much easier to operate and listen to.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 733. However these new radios were expensive; one costing around 250 Reichmarks so not many people could afford them. There was a cheaper radio available called the Detektor which did not have an integrated speaker and could only pick up sound when close to a radio station as only 31 percent of the population lived in these urban areas where radio reception was possible the majority of people would have had to purchase the more expensive design.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 733-737. This changed in 1930 when transmitting stations that reached a wider area were commissioned by the Reichpost meaning that over two thirds of the German population were able to listen to the radio using the more affordable sets. Yet the social divide of listeners was still evident by the fact that of the middle classes 1 out of 2 homes owned a radio compared with working-class families where only 1 out of every 7 households owned one.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 738. Money was the main reason for this, not just the monthly fees but the cost of running the wireless would have made having the radio an unnecessary cost to some families. A national survey taken 10 years after broadcasting was first introduced showed the difference in people's tastes in music and interests and Weimar's broadcasting technique of catering for the tastes of the minority; the middle-classes, failed to culturally unite the people of Germany.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 750. By 1932 radio companies in Germany officially became public enterprises when all private investors were bought out and all assets were controlled by the postal ministry and the Lander governments this bringing the mixed economy of German broadcasting to an end. When the Nazi party came to power in 1933 they decided to strip the Lander governments of their power over broadcasting and the Berlin Ministry for propaganda gained total control over German broadcasting.Karl Christian F√ºhrer, ‚ÄòA Medium of Modernity? Broadcasting in Weimar Germany, 1923‚Äì1932‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, 69, 4, (1997), p. 727.  Nazi Propaganda  When Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933 the Nazi Party embarked on a 5-week political campaign aimed at increasing the Nazi party's supporters before the March elections which included using the radio to broadcast their propaganda daily, and also reducing the airtime of its coalition partner the German National Peoples Party.Maja Adena, Ruben Enikolopov, Maria Petrova, Veronica Santarosa, & Ekaterina Zhuravskaya, ‚ÄòRadio and the Rise of the Nazis in Prewar Germany‚Äô, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 130, 4, (2015), p, 1887 In March 1933 the Ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda was formed with Joseph Goebbels as its head and upon the creation of his ministry he immediately took control of the National Broadcasting Company making him and other key Nazi officials in charge of all radio broadcasts. Goebbels knew what an effective platform radio broadcasting could be in distributing Nazi propaganda and so a people's receiver; knows as the volksempfanger, was put into production as soon as the Nazi's assumed power. Goebbels pushed manufacturers to dramatically increase the production of the People's Radio even making sure small and cheaper versions of this radio were made so everyone in Germany could have one in their own home.Robert Rowen ‚ÄòGray and Black Radio Propaganda Against Nazi Germany‚Äô in New York Military Affairs Symposium, 18 April, The CUNY Graduate Center, (New York, 2003) Goebbels also pressed for volksempfangers to be in all public places making these broadcasts even more accessible. Goebbels insisted on hiring local ‚Äò‚Äôwireless wardens‚Äô‚ÄôRoger Manvell. & Heinrich Fraenkel, Doctor Goebbels (London, 1974), pp. 116-117 so the public could be warned of any important future broadcasts.Roger Manvell. & Heinrich Fraenkel, Doctor Goebbels (London, 1974), pp. 116-117 By using the radio as a propaganda tool the Nazi Party did succeed in gaining more votes which is not surprising as from 1933 onwards it would have been heavily biased towards the Nazi Party‚Äôs views. Anti-Semitic propaganda began airing as soon as the Nazi‚Äôs took control of broadcasting but it wasn‚Äôt the party‚Äôs main focus although Anti-Semitic broadcasts did start to increase for a while after the Nuremberg Laws were put into place in 1935 which meant Jews were no longer allowed to be German citizens and were also prohibited from marrying or having a sexual relationship with non-Jews.Maja Adena, Ruben Enikolopov, Maria Petrova, Veronica Santarosa, & Ekaterina Zhuravskaya, ‚ÄòRadio and the Rise of the Nazis in Prewar Germany‚Äô, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 130, 4, (2015), p, 1898 Anti-Semitic propaganda died down over the next two years until a German diplomat was killed by a man named Herschel Gryszpan, who happened to be Jewish. From the beginning of 1939, Anti-Semitic messages were constantly broadcast with the aim of spreading the message that there was a very real and dangerous Jewish conspiracy against the German people.Maja Adena, Ruben Enikolopov, Maria Petrova, Veronica Santarosa, & Ekaterina Zhuravskaya, ‚ÄòRadio and the Rise of the Nazis in Prewar Germany‚Äô, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 130, 4, (2015), p, 1898. It is important to note that Nazi propaganda was only ever really successful if its audience already inclined to agree with the propaganda message. From the outset this animation has an overwhelming military feel starting with the title The Battle for Miggershausen beginning with army of radios marching to the town from the broadcasting centre: the speedy single line march is cleverly made to look like an envoy of military trucks and the sneaky tactics used to get into the town are obvious military manoeuvres. Once they have control over the town they raise the makeshift white flag, showing the rest of the country that this town has surrendered. The leader of the radio army is supposed to represent Hitler and this is seen clearly in his speech to the town at the end, by the way he commands the crowds‚Äô attention with his strong hand gestures and charisma. As a propaganda piece this animated commercial is very well-made as it uses one successful platform for propaganda; the short animated film, to advertise another propaganda tool, radio broadcasting. Short animations were very popular in Germany due to the success of the Walt Disney cartoons and it was no secret that Hitler and Goebbels were ardent fans of the films.Rolf Giesen, & J.P Storm, Animation Under the Swastika: A History of Trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933-1945 (North Carolina, 2012), p. 13 As a Nazi policy the modernizing of agricultural areas and therefore improving the social and economic aspects of the population would have appealed to the working-classes and also the rural middle-classes who owned their own small farms and were suffering due to the economic troubles in Germany.

He was a very hard working person from his childhood and grew up having a dream in his eyes to do something for his state and the people of Odisha. During his time there was no connectivity of road to his village, and due to lack of funds, he was unable to cross the river by boat so he would swim across the river to go to school. But there was an incident which changed his life. When Birendra was 13 years old, his Father died due to some health issue. His mother was his prime inspiration. After that Birendra stayed in his maternal uncle's house to complete his schooling. But after his father's death he couldn't concentrate on studies and left home. He went to Kashi, Brindavan and Mathura in order to become a monk. In Mathura he came across a Monk whose advice changed his mind and gave new focus towards life. He came back and completed his matriculation from Indupur High School. He had completed his bachelors and Masters after that. He had seen a dream to serve the poor people of Odisha which motivated him to join the Government of Odisha service in the field of administration.

United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), is a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that explained how the holding of a case should be viewed where there is no majority supporting the rationale of any opinion. Background Petitioners were charged with several counts of transporting obscene materials in interstate commerce, and conspiracy to transport such materials. The conduct that gave rise to the charges covered a period through February 27, 1973, but the trial did not begin until the following October. In the interim, on June 21, 1973, the Supreme Court decided Miller v. California which announced new standards for isolating \\"hard core\\" pornography from expression protected by the First Amendment, the third test of which was \\"whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\\".. Petitioners argued in the District Court that they were entitled to jury instructions not under Miller, but under the more favorable formulation of Memoirs v. Massachusetts that expressive material is constitutionally protected unless it is \\"utterly without redeeming social value.\\". The Court noted that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause is a limitation upon the powers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch of government. But the principle on which the clause is based‚Äîthe notion that persons have a right to fair warning of that conduct which will give rise to criminal penalties‚Äîis fundamental to our concept of constitutional liberty. Petitioners asserted that Miller unforeseeably expanded the reach of the federal obscenity statutes beyond what was punishable under Memoirs. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, noting that the Memoirs standards never commanded the assent of more than three Justices at any one time, and apparently concluded from this fact that Memoirs never became the law, and therefore the \\"contemporary community standards\\" test from the 1957 Roth v. United States applied, which was arguably at least as strict than the Memoirs test. Opinion of the Court The Court rejected the Petitioners' line of reasoning, stating that when a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \\"the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds . . . .\\"Gregg v. Georgia, (opinion of Stewart, Powell and Stevens). Three Justices joined in the controlling opinion in Memoirs. Two others, Justice Black and Justice Douglas, concurred on broader grounds in reversing the judgment below. They reiterated their well-known position that the First Amendment provides an absolute shield against governmental action aimed at suppressing obscenity. Justice Stewart also concurred in the judgment, based on his view that only \\"hardcore pornography\\" may be suppressed. The view of the Memoirs plurality therefore constituted the holding of the Court and provided the governing standards at the time the alleged crimes were committed. Miller marked a significant departure from Memoirs and there can be little doubt that the third test announced in Miller expanded criminal liability. Since the petitioners were indicted for conduct occurring prior to the Court's decision in Miller, the Court found they are entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless it finds that the materials involved are \\"utterly without redeeming social value.\\".

He ordered the construction of the present main building. In 1728, it passed into the Hamilton family. It was shortly thereafter sold and subsequently belonged to several different families. The main building was rebuilt in 1767-70, during the ownership of Rutger Bennet (1720-1791). In the years 1928-30, Rolf Gyllensvaan von Otter (1891‚Äì1967) carried out thorough repairs. At that time, the third floor was removed and the castle received its present appearance. V√§stan√• Manor is a large high-rise, two-store building. Since 1948, V√§stan√• has been a hotel, conference center and restaurant. The facility is operated by the members of the von Otter family.

It primarily represented workers employed in manufacturing whitegoods, but also had some membership in foundries and light engineering. History The union was founded in 1890, following a successful strike in the light metal industry in Rotherham, led by the Knights of Labor. Initially named the National Union of Stove Grate Workers, it gradually recruited members in other parts of Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Midlands, and created a small branch in London. Over time, it expanded its remit, and was renamed the National Union of Stove Grate and General Metal Workers, then as the National Union of Domestic Appliance and General Metal Workers, before adopting its final name.H.

The appointments were made to celebrate the official birthday of The King, and were published in The London Gazette on 2 June 1922. Controversy from the 1922 Birthday Honours list eventually led to the passage of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 and creation of the Honours Committee to formally review nominations. Sir Joseph Benjamin Robinson, chairman of the Robinson South African Banking Company and generous contributor to Prime Minister David Lloyd George's Liberal Party, was listed for a barony \\"for national and imperial services.\\" Robinson quickly declined the honour within weeks after arguments erupted in the House of Lords over the circumstances of his nomination, particularly his residency in South Africa rather than in Great Britain, and that he was not recommended for the honour directly by the South African colonial government as required. \\"Feeling in the House of Lords ran high,\\" reported The Times on 30 June. The Times praised Robinson's letter to the King asking for permission to decline the honour, and pushed for further questioning into the matter: \\"..by his action Sir Joseph Robinson has placed himself in the right and has left the Government to explain, if they can, how and why they placed themselves in the wrong. It seems clear from the letter that Sir Joseph Robinson did not in any way seek the honour. Therefore, some person or persons unknown must have sought to induce him to accept it. Who are those persons, what are their functions, and what were their motives?\\" The recipients of honours are displayed here as they were styled before their new honour, and arranged by honour, with classes (Knight, Knight Grand Cross, etc.) and then divisions (Military, Civil, etc.) as appropriate.

The Northamptons had owned property in the area since the sixteenth century and continued to do so until the twentieth century. The area has since been redeveloped and is now largely occupied by City University London, and public housing. The Northamptons had a practice of granting leases on their properties to \\"house farmers\\", also known as \\"house knackers\\" or \\"house jobbers\\", who then subdivided the houses and let them on again in order to maximise returns.\\"Northampton Square area: Introduction\\", in Survey of London, Volume 46, South and East Clerkenwell, ed. Philip Temple. London, 2008. pp. 294-304. In law, the house farmers were responsible to the Northamptons for the maintenance of the houses but in practice the requirement to maintain the properties was not often enforced leading to poor quality properties and a greater profit for the house farmer.Jephson, Henry. (1907) The sanitary evolution of London. Brooklyn: A. Wessels Co. pp. 322-333. The practice of house farming quickly led to overcrowding and slum conditions, and was one of the matters investigated by the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes in 1884-85 where Ball was named as one of the main house farmers under the Marquess of Northampton as well as letting property elsewhere in London. He was also stated to be vice-chairman of the Clerkenwell parish assessment and appeal committee. Witnesses to the enquiry in 1884 could not agree whether Ball was a good landlord or not with some reporting that he would threaten to raise the rent if it was not paid by a tenant on the due date and others reporting fair treatment. There was agreement, however, that Ball made little effort to repair the properties.First report of Her Majesty's Commissioners for Inquiring into the Housing of the Working Classes.

The College also offers graduate programs in building construction, landscape architecture, industrial design, executive real estate development (a joint program with AU's Harbert College of Business), and distance education in construction management.http://cadc.auburn.edu/architecture/about-architecture History Architecture program in Auburn University began as part of the civil engineering curriculum in 1907, making Auburn one of the first universities in the nation, and the first in the South, to offer architecture as a major. Five years later, a department was established when Joseph Hudnut was appointed chair. In 1927, when Frederic Child Biggin was chosen to head the department, it acquired the status of the School of Architecture and Applied Arts. That same year, Interior Design was one of the allied programs created in the school.College of Architecture, Design and Construction publication, CADC 100: 1907-2007https://archive.org/details/pattersonsameri00unkngoog The early 1930s saw a number of firsts in what would become departments in the CADC. *Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning (later to become Community Planning) programs were established in 1930. *In 1932, as part of the five- year Bachelor of Science degree in Architecture at Auburn, a choice of an \\"Architectural Construction Option\\" was first offered. *In 1945, Auburn joined the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, a membership association founded in 1912 to advance the quality of architectural education.College of Architecture, Design and Construction publication, CADC 100: 1907-2007 Over the past century, with new programs added to the school, it went through several name changes. *In 1950, when the school was reorganized, it was renamed the School of Architecture and Fine Arts, and took residence in Biggin Hall. *In 1977, the School moved into the newly built Dudley Hall, named after Auburn School of Engineering graduate and benefactor, Ralph Dudley (1884‚Äì1969). *In 1987, the School was renamed \\"The School of Architecture,\\" and organized into three disciplines‚ÄîArchitecture, Building Science and Industrial Design. *In 1996, the College of Architecture, Design, and Construction (CADC) was born. *In consultation with Interior Design alumni, Interior Architecture was designed and launched in 1997.College of Architecture, Design and Construction publication, CADC 100: 1907-2007. *In Fall 2007, when the Graphic Design Program was incorporated into the Department of Industrial Design, it became the Department of Industrial and Graphic Design. *Subsequently, in 2013, the department was renamed School of Industrial and Graphic Design.College of Architecture, Design and Construction publication, CADC 100: 1907-2007. *In 2018, the Alabama Prison Arts + Education Project joined the CADC as a non-degree-granting, outreach program.

The coalition of programs within APLA (and with the CADC) exemplifies interdisciplinary collaboration as a model of professional activity; insures that students have an overview of the various components in the design and building process; and promotes the connection among planning, landscape architecture, interior architecture, and architecture as interdependent practices. Further, APLA provides the students a context for understanding how these four elements of the building process integrate into the larger wholes of the community and urban context, and the planning, design, and construction industry. The relationship between the programs in the college also allows for joint degree programs that extend professional opportunities.College of Architecture, Design and Construction publication, CADC 100: 1907-2007 Architecture The Architecture Program is a five-year program, that leads to an accredited professional Bachelor of Architecture degree. The professional Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch.) is a fully accredited program by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). The five-year curriculum is structured as two stages of study: Pre-Architecture and Professional studies. Service learning opportunities form an important component in the curriculum. After graduating with this degree and successfully completing a six-month internship, graduates are eligible to begin taking the ARE licensing exams.http://cadc.auburn.edu/architecture/architecture-degrees-programs Auburn University's College of Architecture, Design and Construction (CADC) programs once again are ranked among the best in the nation by DesignIntelligence in its annual survey, \\"America‚Äôs Best Architecture and Design Schools 2016.\\" The architecture program is ranked eighth.

Seventy years later, in 1997, Interior Design became a dual-degree program with Architecture, entitled Interior Architecture (ARIA). Interior Architecture students complete the first two years of the Architecture curriculum before entering the ARIA Program. Starting in 1998, ARIA presented its first Summer Thesis class. Since then, the ARIA theses have dealt with Interior Architecture issues in relation to a social and international dimension. Designs have included projects on Sarajevo, Havana, Turkey, Venice, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Sustainability projects at Auburn University.http://cadc.auburn.edu/design/design-degrees-programs Student in Landscape Architecture class Landscape architecture Auburn's first Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (LA) was awarded in 1933, when LA was a part of the Department of Horticulture and Forestry. In 1941, as a five-year program, LA was housed under the School of Architecture and Allied Arts. But low enrollment forced the school to phase out the program in 1952. After a licensure legislation was passed in Alabama in 1976, the program was reestablished as a degree within the School of Architecture. The student chapter of the ASLA (American Society for Landscape Architecture) was formed in 1979. By 1993, the program had four full-time faculty, 50 students, and received a five-year accreditation renewal. Jack Williams was appointed chair of the program in 1995. The program began to offer master's degree in 1998. Two years later, the first MLA students graduate, and the program is granted initial accreditation as a professional program.College of Architecture, Design and Construction publication, CADC 100: 1907-2007http://cadc.auburn.edu/architecture/architecture-masters-degrees- programs/landscape-architecture =Special programs= Rural studio In 1993, Auburn University architecture professors, Dennis K.

This offering was followed by a course entitled \\"Light Construction\\" by the Civil Engineering Department in 1942. In 1945, a four-year degree entitled, \\"Building Construction,\\" was developed and transferred to the Department of Architecture. The Building Science program at Auburn University (BSCI) established in 1947, is the second oldest construction education program in the United States. Building Construction Program attained departmental status in 1957 and was renamed the Department of Building Technology. In 1975, Building Technology became the Department of Building Science (BSCI), and moved into the newly built Dudley Hall in 1977, from Toomer's Corner. It received full accreditation in 1980.http://cadc.auburn.edu/construction With approval from the Alabama Council for Higher Education grants, a Master's of Building Construction was initiated in 1991. In 2006, the Department of Building Science moved to its new building M. Miller Gorrie Center (named after Miller Gorrie, a 1957 graduate of the Building Construction, and CEO of Birmingham-based Brasfield & Gorrie). The Center earned the State of Alabama's first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) gold certification. In 2007, the Department of Building Science undergoes yet another name change: the McWhorter School of Building Science.http://cadc.auburn.edu/construction In 2002, architecture professor D.K. Ruth collaborated with building science professor John Mouton to create the Design-Build Master program, one of only six in the country. The program is the only jointly-housed degree granting program between architecture and construction management in the United States. In 2012, the program was renamed Master of Integrated Design and Construction. It was conceived as a way to prepare students for their professional lives. Over the course of three semesters, students gain hands-on experience across the entire spectrum of estimating, scheduling, designing, and constructing projects identified through the College's Center for Community Outreach. At least 50% of the program's curriculum is taught by practicing professionals.http://cadc.auburn.edu/construction In 1946, enrollment in the new Bachelor of Building Construction degree program was 30 students, and quickly rose to 131 students a year later. By 1968, there were seven faculty members and 160 students in the department. The school is currently made up of 18 full-time faculty members, approximately 350 undergraduate students, and 20 graduate students. The program has more than 3,000 graduates located worldwide, including many who are leaders of the construction industry in the Southeast United States. BSCI maintains a proud tradition of practical and professional construction education, offering both Bachelor's and master's degrees in Building Construction. It is a leader in exploring Information Technology applications in construction and construction education.

Eva Pfeil and Walter Schaer join the faculty.College of Architecture, Design and Construction publication, CADC 100: 1907-2007 Graphic Design Program In 1977, Industrial Design gained separate departmental status within the School of Architecture and Fine Arts. With the organization of the new School of Architecture into three departments in 1987, Industrial Design became a part of it. The College of Architecture, Design, and Construction (CADC) was born in 1996, and assumed the Department of Industrial Design under its wing. Succeeding William Bullock, FIDSA, Clark Lundell was appointed head of the Department of Industrial Design and firmly established its highly regarded industry- collaborations program, started in the 60s with ARMCO Steel and ALCOA, continuing in the 70s and 80s with NASA. In 2000, the department moves from its home of 23 years, O.D. Smith Hall, to the newly renovated Wallace Center. Industrial Design Department was awarded accreditation of its graduate and undergraduate curricula by the NASAD (National Association of Schools of Art and Design). In Fall 2007, the Graphic Design Program was incorporated into the Department of Industrial Design. The School of Industrial and Graphic Design was now part of the College of Architecture, Design and Construction. In 2007, the department grew to around 200 undergraduates, 20 graduates and 10 post baccalaureate students.

Professional career (1930‚Äì1964) In addition to his coaching responsibilities, Reese was a member of the faculty of the State Normal School (now known as Eastern Washington University) since 1930. From 1943 to 1950, he worked as an instructor and coach for the Division of Health and Physical Education. In 1948, Reese was responsible for organizing the intramural recreation program at Eastern Washington College of Education (EWCE). He also developed and taught a course called \\"Organization and Administration of Intramurals and Recreation in the Public Schools.\\"Letter to Walter Isle from W. B. Reese, January 20, 1949, W. B. Reese Personnel File, EWU Archives. He became head of the Division of Health, Physical Education and Recreation in 1950, and held this position until 1952. In 1951, Reese became an assistant professor in the College of Education. That same year, he was elevated to the position of associate professor, a position he held until his retirement in 1964. Reese was also the director of athletics at EWCE (eventually Eastern Washington State College) from 1953 to 1963. An article published in The Spokesman-Review in 1941 claims to announce Reese's promotion to director of athletics, however EWCE Personnel records don't show him receiving the formal title of athletic director until 1953. Reese was also one of the athletic directors involved in the early development of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (originally the National Association for Intercollegiate Basketball), serving on the executive board from 1945 to 1953, culminating in service as the NAIA's President in 1952‚Äì53, the year in which the association became the first intercollegiate athletics organization to invite historically black colleges and universities to join as members.Washington State College Powwow, June 1952, p. 11, https://research.libraries.wsu.edu:8443/xmlui/handle/2376/3708 Military service (1942‚Äì1945) Reese took an unpaid leave of absence from Eastern Washington College of Education in September 1942 to serve during World War II: he enlisted voluntarily, apparently out of a desire to serve his country, and was commissioned as a captain into the U.S. Army Air Forces. He was initially stationed at Fort George Wright in Spokane, where he was in charge of the Second Air Force's football program.Letter from Major Warren L. Williams letter to Dr. Ralph E.

He foresaw physical education as an area that would rapidly expand to meet the need for improved programs across the nation.Letter from Major William B. Reese to Dr. Ralph E. Tieje, President Eastern Washington College of Education. Dated March 12, 1945. W.B. Reese Personnel File, Eastern Washington University Archives During his military career, Reese coached the Second Air Force Superbomber football team to 20 victories and one tie out of 23 games played during the 1942 and 1943 seasons. These victories include an undefeated 1942 season and a Sun Bowl win against the Hardin‚ÄìSimmons Cowboys. \\"The Reese Affair\\" at EWCE (1953) As a result of pressure to impose stricter academic requirements on faculty, which was part of an effort to raise the standards of the institution, William Reese became involved in a controversy on campus that was later known as \\"The Reese Affair\\". Reese was a member of the faculty of Cheney State Normal starting in 1930, when the lack of a master's degree was no obstacle to his holding that position, but rising academic standards forced him (and other faculty like him) to seek master's degrees to satisfy the college. In 1951 Reese announced his candidacy for a Master's of Education degree, to be granted by the very institution he was then employed by‚ÄîE.W.C.E. This raised many questions on campus about the propriety of this situation. Those questions erupted into outrage when Reese was erroneously listed in the college's spring 1953 catalog as holding a Master of Education degree that had not yet been defended or awarded: the Faculty Council demanded an investigation into the situation, as allegations began to rise that Reese had conspired with the college's president and others in the administration to essentially secure the degree without completing all its requirements. Reese withdrew his candidacy for the degree entirely, but the controversy that became known as \\"the Reese Affair\\" in the school newspaper and local media continued to unfold: ultimately, while the investigations into these events never turned up any evidence to suggest that Reese had engaged in any misconduct, he was removed as the head of the Health, Recreation, and Physical Education Division (while keeping his AD and coaching responsibilities), and numerous other members of the faculty either resigned or were fired, including Dr. Otis Willard Freeman, the college's president. Despite the Board of Trustees affirming that \\"there is no evidence of any work, action, or intent on [Reese's] part indicating his guilt,\\" some in the college and surrounding community were dissatisfied with this outcome; a letter to the editor in a local paper, published a few days after the Board's announcement, asserts hotly that Reese had used \\"threats and coercion\\" to intimidate his colleagues and claims that \\"his clique...is powerful enough to dictate the entire college policy.\\" Personal and family life Born in Coldwater, Missouri, Reese was raised in Pullman, Washington, and graduated from Pullman High School in 1920. He then went on to Washington State College, also in Pullman, graduating in 1925. At the time of his death in Othello in 1974, Reese was survived by his wife Carmen, his sons John M. Reese of Walla Walla and Robert W. Reese of Wenatchee, a daughter, Mrs. Donna Jean Montzhelmer of Seattle, and eight grandchildren. In an interview in 2010, John Reese remarked about his father that \\"he was a good father who tried to do a lot for his kids, and he did a good job of balancing his coaching with his family.\\" Honors and accomplishments According to his obituary, \\"Reese was a member of the Cheney Masonic Lodge, the Shrine in Spokane, Kappa Sigma Fraternity, the WSU Crimson Circle, the EWSC Scarlet Arrow, and the Othello Rotary Club.\\"Spokane Daily Chronicle ‚Äì Apr 19, 1974 Reese was active in a number of local organizations, including the Cheney Kiwanis (1935‚Äì1942), the Cheney Chamber of Commerce (1935‚Äì1953), and the sports and civics committee of the Spokane Chamber of Commerce (1957‚Äì1962). Reese's former students often joined the coaching ranks themselves‚Äîaccording to one source in 1952, \\"his [Reese's] boys...now number well over a hundred in the coaching ranks of the Pacific Northwest\\", although in a letter of recommendation regarding Reese in 1950, a local high school coach claims that \\"at least two hundred coaches are passing on their athletic ways [who] have been tutored by the congenial 'Red' Head.\\"Letter from William M. Diedrick to Harold Anderson, W. B. Reese Personnel File, Eastern Washington University Archives Regardless of the exact number, the breadth of his influence in the local high school coaching ranks appears to have been considerable. The 2009 edition of ESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia, in its entry for Eastern Washington University, named Reese as \\"Best Coach\\" in the institution's history.

Biography Stephen Finney Mason was born in LeicestershireThe ODNB says in Leicester; the FRS memoir says in Anstey. on 6 July 1923, the first child of Leonard Stephen Mason, a garage owner, and Chrissie Harriette (n√©e Finney). He won a scholarship to Wyggeston Grammar School from 1933 to 1941; from there he gained an open scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford. He graduated with a first-class degree in 1945 and, in 1947, was awarded a DPhil on the biological activity of antimalarials, supervised by Dalziel Hammick. Mason had hoped to continue research in the chemistry department, but his attempt to find a position was blocked by Robert Robinson as the result of a dispute between Robertson and Hammick. He turned, instead, to the history of science. In 1947 he was invited by F. Sherwood Taylor, the curator of the History of Science Museum, Oxford to join his staff as a departmental demonstrator (junior lecturer), on condition that he also became the secretary and treasurer of the Society for the Study of Alchemy and Early Chemistry. His role in the museum was to give lectures of general interest on the history of science, which required greatly expanding his reading and knowledge. In 1953 he published A History of the Sciences, a book that has been reprinted 27 times and translated into seven languages. Throughout this time, though, Mason was concerned that he was slipping further away from the bench; and he was also aware that Oxford would not welcome him back as a research scientist. He was offered a fellowship by Adrien Albert, the head of the Department of Medical Chemistry at the ANU, which was temporarily based in the Wellcome Institute in London. In 1953 Mason joined the man whose work he had long admired, where he was put in charge of a new suite of spectroscopic instruments. In 1955 had to move to UCL (his lab at the Wellcome by was needed by the Institute), where he had the chance to improve his understanding of quantum chemistry and molecular spectroscopy. Work on the new labs in Canberra was finished in 1956, and Albert returned to the ANU. Mason was offered the chance of a post there but, for various reasons, it did not work out. Instead, he went to the University of Exeter as a lecturer in physical-organic chemistry. During his time there he worked on chirality. Mason was promoted to Reader in 1963. He moved to a foundation chair of Chemistry at the University of East Anglia in 1964. His appointment was as Professor of Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry, ‚Äúa position that he felt did not accord well with his polymathematical inclinations.‚Äù He moved to a chair of chemistry at King‚Äôs College London in late 1969, where he remained until retirement in 1988. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1982. On his retirement, Stephen Mason and his wife moved to Cambridge where, for the next couple of years he worked on his book Chemical evolution: origins of the elements, molecules and living systems, supported by a Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship. Family During his time at the Museum of the History of Science, Mason joined Christopher Hill's Communist Party Historians Group. Another member was Bridget Irene Sutton; they married on 31 December 1949. The marriage did not last, and the couple parted on friendly terms. Bridget later married Hill, while Stephen married Joan Banus in 1955. She had been working at UCL while he was at ANU. They had three sons in the next five years: Oliver Neil, Andrew Lawrence and Lionel Jeremy, all of whom have successful careers in their fields. Joan died on 20 Mar 2004, and was cremated in Cambridge on the 31st. Stephen died on 11 December 2007.

The aim was to create a series of railways which would connect Waterford, Cork, Dublin and Galway. The creation of such links was considered a good investment for the stock market but also intended to have a positive impact on businesses in Ireland and links to the rest of the UK. Kilkenny-Waterford Line The first part of the rail line to be completed was the Kilkenny to Thomastown section. Work began in 1846 but the line didn't open until 12 May 1848 due to delays in waiting for other railway companies to finish connecting track. Thomastown station was a Tudor Revival building which opened 1848. The line reached Seapoint Hill in 1850 and the rest of the track to Waterford was completed in 1853 with the opening of the station at Dunkitt. In 1850 the company applied for an Act to allow them to raise further funds. The long term goal being the trunk line to the midlands. Another Act was put forward in 1866 to create a new company called the Central Ireland Railways. In anticipation of the increased range of the Waterford and Kilkenny Railway company the name was changed to the Waterford & Central Ireland Railway in 1868. The line from Kilkenny only reached Maryborough in 1867. The line to Mountmellick was opened in 1883 and that was as far as the Waterford & Central Ireland Railway got. In 1900, as a result of Acts of Parliament, several important lines became part of the GS&WR; system, including the Waterford and Central Ireland Railway and the Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway. The Thomastown Viaduct The Thomastown Viaduct The line from Thomastown to Jerpoint Hill, completed in 1850, was the section which needed the viaduct across the river Nore. Captain William Moorsom was the engineer who designed the structure of lattice woodwork beginning the work in 1846. It was two hundred feet long and seventy- eight feet above the River Nore. At twenty-five feet wide, it was designed for two lines, although only one was built. When done was the longest single span viaduct in either Ireland or Great Britain. The new viaduct had Charles Richard Galwey (1840‚Äì94) as the engineer. The iron structure was completed in 1877. It replaced an older wooden viaduct which was feared to be unstable and dangerous. Throughout the 1850s there were reports on the safety of the structure and while all agreed it was safe it was still recommended to replace it with an iron viaduct which would need less maintenance.

Early life Larson and his identical twin brother Ronald were born in Yakima, Washington, on 2 April 1915. His parents were Alvin N. Larson and Anna D. Larson. He took flying lessons at McAllister Flying School at McAllister Field in Yakima in 1928. Military career Larson enlisted as an Air Cadet at McChord Field, Tacoma, Washington, in April or May 1941, where he received his flight training, and continued as a flight instructor. He was assigned to the 339th Bomb Group in 1943. That year, the 339th Bomb Group was moved from Hunter Army Air Field in Georgia to Walterboro Army Air Field in South Carolina, where they flew reconfigured P-39s in as fighter-bombers. Larson went with the 339th as it was moved to Fowlmere, England in April 1944, and began flying P-51s. He was later posted to the 505th Fighter Squadron as a combat pilot. On 13 May 1944, he shot down his first enemy aircraft, and earned a promotion to major. Only 11 days later, on 24 May, he shot down an additional three aircraft. He earned the ace designation by shooting down his fifth enemy aircraft on 25 July 1944.

They are from the Fanti tribe of the Akan peoples. Historians believe so because they cannot find any records of any other African-American family whose ancestry has been consistently kept and published. Their origins began in Ghana, and now the majority resides in either Maryland or Virginia/Washington DC and more recently parts of Pennsylvania. Transcript of NPR interview  Origin  The Quanders originated from the Fanti tribe in Ghana. A man by the name of Egya Amkwandoh was kidnapped during the African slave trade during the late 17th century and transported to the United States. According to official slave records, when slave owners asked for his name, and he answered ‚ÄúAmkwandoh,‚Äù which was misinterpreted as ‚ÄúI am Quando.‚Äô The next few generations of Quanders went by the name Quando rather than Quander. Other variations used include Quandoe and Kwando. The name became recognized as the present day pronunciation ‚ÄúQuander‚Äù during the 19th century. Egya Amkwandoh had two sons, who were both taken away from him and split up. One was sent to Maryland and the other sent to Virginia. The first known records of the ‚ÄúQuando‚Äù family existing as free people descent from the Maryland side, specifically the family member Henry Quando. A slave owner by the name of Henry Adams from Port Tobacco, Charles County, Maryland, included the freedom of the Maryland Quandos in his will on October 13, 1684. The Quandos who reside in Virginia are related to George Washington, as well as the ones who remained in slavery up until the death of Martha Washington. Where the family‚Äôs freed members acquired land, Quander Road and later Quander Road Elementary School (now known as Quander School) were named after the family. At least one home built along Quander Road has been standing for 100 years.  Slavery to George Washington  Nancy Quander and her mother Sukey Bay were amongst the slaves who worked on the grounds of George Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon. Nancy Quander worked as a spinner for the Washington family and began her work once she was of age; 13 years old. She worked in a small back room behind the slave quarters. The slave quarters were two one-story wings, one a female wing and the other male. Even if the slaves were married, they had to sleep separately. The quarters consisted of a working area and sleeping room, both of which had conditions that were unsanitary in addition to being small, and every room contained a fireplace as well. In his will George Washington stated that he wanted his 124 slaves to be released upon the death of his wife, Martha Washington. George Washington died on December 14, 1799 with Martha signing a deed of manumission in December 1800, and the slaves were set free on January 1, 1801. On that date, Nancy Quander being one of the slaves included in Washington's will, was freed. She returned to his tombstone with ten others about 30 years later to pay their respects attributed to their loyalty to Washington, whom they claimed to have been like a father.  Family reunions  There are two branches of Quanders; those who reside in Maryland and those who reside in the Virginia/Washington, D.C. area. The Quanders of Virginia and Washington DC have been celebrating annual family reunions since 1926. The Quanders of Maryland did not begin the tradition until 1974. The Quanders had their 85th family reunion held at Mount Vernon for the first time in 2010 to return to the grounds their family was once enslaved to. The family placed boxwood twigs and cuttings on the slave memorial in memory and respect to their ancestors who worked the grounds.  Noteworthy Quanders  = Henry Quando = Many believe that he is one of the two sons of Egya Amkwandoh who was the first Quander brought to America through the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. He established himself in Maryland to build a family and eventually become freed in 1864. He was one of the first black males to adopt and act on the idea of civil rights, stemming from legal altercations involving his wife and daughters. = Charles Henry Quander = Charles Quander is the father of Nancy Quander, and worked on Hayfield Plantation; a slave plantation in present-day Fairfax County (the land of which is now Hayfield Secondary School). Once he was freed (probably after the Civil War), he bought two acres of land at a time up until his holdings amounted to 88 acres. When he died, his land around what became Quander Road was divided up among his children and then subsequently among their heirs. = Nancy Carter Quander = Nancy Carter Quander, one of the daughters of George Washington's slave Suckey Bay and by virtue a slave herself, married Charles Quander of Maryland following her release to freedom. She was a spinner and landscaper; records have been found and kept of her work on the Mount Vernon grounds. She worked in the back room of the slave housing, spinning cloth for George Washington's garments. It is believed that she was unable to read or write, therefore after her release from Mount Vernon, no records can be found of her life thereafter. = Nellie Quander = Nellie Quander was a 1910 initiate of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and served as its first international president. She led a group of five other sorority members (which included two founders) which ensured Alpha Kappa Alpha's perpetuity by securing legal incorporation on January 29, 1913. This strategic move enabled Alpha Kappa Alpha to grow by establishing chapters throughout the United States and, later, abroad. It also protected the name, colors, symbols and integrity of the organization. Nellie Quander also is closely related to George Washington as she is a direct descendant of West Ford, son of Bushrod Washington, who was George Washington‚Äôs nephew. = Elizabeth Ann Quander = Elizabeth Ann Quander was one of the first lead singers with the Duke Ellington Band. For a ceremony in her honor, she sang at the White House for former president Jimmy Carter in 1977, long after her retirement. = Rohulamin Quander = Rohulamin Quander is president of the Quander Historical Society, as well as an Administrative Judge for Washington, D.C. = Jay Quander = Jahmond ‚ÄúJay‚Äù Quander is a descendant of the Quanders that worked on the Mount Vernon Estate, and established their freed slave community where Quander Road and Quander Road School stand. Some family members still live on the land acquired after their ancestor's release. Jay is now the Director of Food and Beverage at the Estate in which his family was enslaved. =Paul Alonzo Quander Jr.= Was the Washington, D.C deputy mayor for public safety and justice, with responsibility for the police and fire departments, and for six months was acting chief of staff for then Mayor Vincent C. Gray. =Michael Quander= Michael Quander is a television journalist currently working for WUSA-TV in Washington, D.C. He won a 2018 National Capital/Chesapeake Bay Emmy Award for \\"Historic/Cultural - No Time Limit\\" for his segment on his family's history.

He showed great promise as a two-year-old in 1998, winning the Superlative Stakes on his racecourse debut, taking second in the Champagne Stakes and then recording a seven length victory in the Racing Post Trophy. He never won again although he was placed in the Princess of Wales's Stakes and the Prix Foy as a four-year-old. He made no impact as a breeding stallion in a brief stud career spent in Japan and Ireland. Background Commander Collins was a bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud. He was from the eleventh crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Commander Collins' dam Kanmary was a high class racemare who won the Prix du Bois and was placed in several other major races. She was even more successful as broodmare, producing Colonel Collins (third in the 1994 Epsom Derby), City Leader (Royal Lodge Stakes) and Lit de Justice. Kanmary was descended from the French broodmare Theodora who was the female-line ancestor of Soviet Star and The Very One. During his racing career, Commander Collins was owned by Sangster in partnership with Tony Collins, after whom the colt was named. Collins was a former trainer best known for his involvement in the Gay Future affair and had acquired the nickname \\"The Colonel\\" ironically after he failed an officer's exam during National Service. Sangster had previously named Colonel Collins in his friend's honour. After the colt's second race, a share in his ownership was bought by John Magnier. Commander Collins was sent into training with Peter Chapple-Hyam at Sangster's training establishment at Manton in Wiltshire. Racing career =1998: two-year-old season= Commander Collins never contested a maiden race, beginning his racing career in the Listed Superlative Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 9 July in which he was ridden by John Reid. Despite his lack of prior experience he started 4/5 favourite against five opponents headed by the Chesham Stakes winner Rhapsodist. After recovering from a poor start, he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from Rhapsodist with Dehoush in third ahead of Royal Rebel. The colt was highly regarded by his trainer and attracted support in the betting for the following year's 2000 Guineas but was then kept of the course for several weeks with a respiratory infection. Jimmy Fortune took over the ride when the colt returned to contest the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 11 September, and partnered him in most of his subsequent races. Starting at odds of 7/2, he tracked the leaders before staying on in the straight but failed by a head to overhaul the Barry Hills-trained Auction House. Commander Collins returned to Doncaster on 24 October and was made the 2/1 favourite for the Group One Racing Post Trophy over one mile on heavy ground. His five rivals were Tumbleweed Ridge (third in the Champagne Stakes), the maiden winners Timahs, Magno and Housemaster and the 20/1 outsider Stormy Skye. The favourite was restrained by Fortune at the rear of the field as Magno set the pace but began to make progress approaching the last quarter mile. He took the lead a furlong out and quickly went clear of his opponents to win easily by seven lengths from Magno. After the race he was made favourite for the 1999 Epsom Derby. Chapple-Hyam commented \\"It was a long, long way up the straight and I was worried about running him when I saw the state of the course. He is still green, still learning, and can only get better\\". =1999: three-year-old season= On his three year old debut Commander Collins started 8/1 fourth favourite for the 2000 Guineas run that year on the July Course at Newmarket on 1 May. After tracking the leaders in the early stage he faded badly in the last quarter mile and finished eleventh of the sixteen runners behind Island Sands. Jimmy Fortune reported that the colt had been unsuited by the fast ground. He was off the course for over three months before returning in the Group two Prix Guillaume d'Ornano at Deauville Racecourse on 14 August. Ridden by Gerald Mosse he never looked likely to win and finished fourth of five behind Val Royal. Later in August Robert Sangster dismissed Chapple-Hyam as the trainer at Manton and appointed John Gosden to replace him. =2000: four- year-old season= In four starts in Europe in 2000, Commander Collins ran consistently without winning. He finished fourth to Little Rock in the Gordon Richards Stakes in April and then returned after a lengthy absence to run third behind the same horse in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket in July. In September he was sent to France where he finished third to Montjeu in the Prix Foy before returning to England to run fourth in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes. On his final racecourse appearance Commander Collins was sent to the United States for the Turf Classic Invitational at Belmont Park on 7 October. Starting a 35/1 outsider he was in contention in the early stages but faded in the closing stages and finished eleventh behind the nine-year-old gelding John's Call. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Commander Collins was exported to become a breeding stallion in Japan where he sired only three winners in two seasons at stud. He returned to Ireland in and sired a few minor winners, mainly under National Hunt rules, with the last of his foals being born in 2005.

She returned to Paris and studied with Russian expatriates Lyubov Egorova and Mathilde Kschessinska. She also studied at the Sorbonne for a baccalaureate in philosophy. She left after one year when her husband was stationed to Washington DC during World War II. Dance career Salbaing danced with the Washington Concert Ballet for three years. In 1946 she moved to Montreal when her husband relocated there for work. She performed with Fernand Nault on stage and danced for and choreographed classical ballet pieces at Radio- Canada. During this time she met Ludmilla Chiriaeff and danced for her company Les Ballets Chiriaeff. She retired from dancing after an injury but continued to choreograph as a freelancer. Although she loved classical ballet, she felt it restricted her choreography. She began to learn jazz technique to expand her dance vocabulary. Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal In 1972 Salbaing co- founded Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal with Eva Von Gencsy and Eddie Toussaint and Salbaing became the company's administrator. There was tension between the founders and Toussaint left in 1974. Gencsy left a couple of years later in 1978 and never spoke of the split. Toussaint stated that Gencsy wanted to maintain the polished balletic lines while Salbaing wanted to make the company more commercial. However, Salbaing stated that her goal was not to create a jazz dance company but to create a contemporary dance company that performed to jazz music. When Toussaint and Gencsy left Les Ballets Jazz Salbaing became its artistic director. Under her leadership the company toured domestically and internationally to 54 countries and performing almost 1500 times. She also founded dance schools of Les Ballets Jazz in Quebec City, Laval, Saint-Jean and Toronto. In the 1980s interest in the dance style of Les Ballets Jazz was waning. Salbaing sought to evolve her company by bringing new choreographers to create works for the company like Brian Macdonald. In 1992 she retired as its artistic director. A clip of Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal performing Locked Up Laura in 2010 can be seen on Jacob's Pillow Dance Interactive. Personal life Salbaing met her husband in Casablanca. He was stationed there during World War II as a naval architect while she danced at the municipal ballet. Her youngest son, Patrick Salbaing, was involved with the Les Ballets Jazz dance school in Toronto. Awards In 1987 Salbaing was appointed a member of the Order of Canada. In 2012 she became an officer of the National Order of Quebec where she was cited for her work with the company.

It is home to the 1,200 acre Tythegston Estate, an ancient 350 year old family farming and property enterprise, with a portfolio of good quality cottages and houses to let, an industrial estate as well as hosting green energy and food production. The seaside town of Porthcawl, with its numerous beaches is within 3 miles, as is Bridgend inter-city rail station (London hourly express train c.2hrs 10mins). The village covers an area of . It is part of the community of Merthyr Mawr. History The parish name comes from the patron saint of the village church, St Tudwg, one of the disciples of the hermit Cenydd, and is derived from its ancient Welsh appellation, Llan Dudwg, meaning \\"Dudwg's Town\\". Its English name has been spelt in different ways, including Tedegestowe (13th century), Tegestowe (14th century), Dythyston (15th century), Tythegston and Tithexton (16th century). The Welsh name has been spelt as: Llandudock (15th century) and Landidwg (16th century). There is evidence to suggest that a Roman villa was once constructed in or near the village. Bronze Age remains (which include a barrow and a cremation) have been found in the area. =Medieval= The parish was absorbed into the territory of Newcastle with the Norman appropriation of the Glamorgan lowlands. Tythegston was constituted as a sub-manor sometime around the late 13th or early 14th century. In 1870‚Äì72 the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales by John Marius Wilson described Tythegston as: Geography Tythegston is located in the southern part of Bridgend in South Wales, west of Bridgend, its nearest town and lies to the north side of the A4106 road. The village covers an area of , of which are of common land or waste. By road Tythegston is situated southwest of Swansea and west of the capital city Cardiff. The landscape is dominated by farms and woodland such as Tythegston Church. Governance At the national level Tythegston is in the Welsh parliamentary constituency of Bridgend, for which Madeleine Moon (Labour) has been MP since 2005. In the general election of 2015, Moon won 14,624 votes (37.1%), giving her a majority of 1,927; the Conservative Party won 12,697 votes (32.2%) and the United Kingdom Independence Party won 5,911 (15%), while the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats each won fewer than 3,000 votes, the Green Party performed better of the two. In the Welsh Assembly Tythegston is in the constituency of Bridgend for which Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales, has been the Assembly Member since 1999. For European elections Tythegston is in the Wales constituency. Notable landmarks The present church, St Tudwg, is of 11th century design. It was deconsecrated in around 1990. St Tudwg was converted into offices in 2010 after a four-year restoration project. In the Glamorgan Archives in Cardiff a book of the registers contains baptisms from 1758, burials from 1766 and marriages starting from 1837; marriages ended until 1965, baptisms and burials to 1987.

Constructed in 1926 for Sir John Holden & Sons Ltd, it was the last cotton mill to be built in Bolton and is a Grade II listed building. Architecture Designed by the local architectural company of Bradshaw, Gass and Hope, the building has five storeys and a basement, with a typical rectangular floor plan of 14 by 6 bays and a flat concrete roof. The internal structure is made of steel and concrete, faced in brick with red terracotta detailing in a restrained Art Deco style. At one corner is a stair tower with a domed copper roof; projections at other corners carry services between floors. It was designed from the outset to use electricity from the local power station, one of the earliest mills to do so, and thus had no large boiler house and stack, although conventional heating boilers and chimneys were required for heating purposes. Equipment Line shafts at ceiling height on each floor which operated the spinning machines were driven by individual electric motors. The end bays in upper floors were lower than the rest of the floor to allow the mounting of the motors at the appropriate height. The mill housed 125,000 mule spindles and 31,000 ring spindles. History The building and fitting of the mill was completed in 1927, by which time its owner, Sir John Holden, 1st Baronet, had recently died. Sir John was a self-made man who was born in Bolton but lived in Leigh where he was twice Mayor of the town. Cotton spinning at the mill came to an end in 1965, after which time it was occupied by Littlewoods Mail Order as a warehouse. In 2006 planning application for conversion to apartments. The exterior window frames visible today are actually unglazed and provide open balcony screens designed to preserve the mill's original appearance.

Early parental divorce (during primary school) has been associated with greater internalising and externalising behaviour problems in the child, while divorce later in childhood or adolescence may dampen academic performance. Children of unmarried parents tend to suffer greater emotional and social difficulties than others do. Whilst father absence mainly results from parental divorce and separation, other factors such as family poverty, developmental difficulties have been associated with father absence, the effects of which have been explained by various theoretical approaches.  Difficulties associated with father absence  = General problems = Despite limited agreement among researchers regarding the exact significance of fathering, fathers are traditionally deemed a provider of protection and support for the child's development. Through a number of pathways, father absence may influence child behaviour, especially in early and middle childhood. These include a decline in household income and ineffective parenting arising from continued conflicts and psychological distress. = Contributing Factors to the Absentee Father = Studies show that there is a direct correlation between a lack of a father figure in the household and negative impacts on the development of young men and women across cultures. Nonetheless, we tend to overlook the causal factors that contribute to fatherlessness outside of correlational research. It is important to note that Family disruption, specifically within communities of color, is not a random event. Researchers argue that one cannot let alone observe fatherlessness under a single variable effect: translated to mean that there is not only one single variable to being an absentee father that affect the maturity and growth of the child. Researchers have also begun to cross reference their research to the multitude of Literature on Fatherlessness finding a third variable that influences child wellbeing: race =The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce= The issue of divorce is a crucial aspect in the society in relations to the life of children. The separation of a married couple due to irreconcilable differences is a matter that is common in the society and its effects on children is negative. It will impact negatively on the education of the children, health conditions of the children, children's relation with their parents as well as the future well- being of the children (Amato, 2000). Therefore, the area relating to the effects of divorce on children is significant for academic inquiry. It makes sense to research on this particular area since it will help learn on the effects that comes with divorce, how children adjust and adapt to divorce and how they are being treated. It is also worth to mention that, parents who divorce have their minds lingering on how their actions will affect their children's happiness as well as health. = Behavioural and mental health difficulties = In regard to the effects of father absence, a recent British study assessed child problem behaviour in over 15,000 families using the clinical cut-offs of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), controlling for household factors such as resources, parental mental health and inter-parental relationship. The study found that father absence at a given age, similar to poverty and parental psychological distress, predicted a high probability of the child scoring above the cut-off score for total difficulties two years later. Likewise, father absence predicted several specific difficulties including borderline personality disorder, severe hyperactivity and abnormal emotional problems. Reciprocally, a child's severe externalising and social during their preschool years were also associated with a greater probability of the father being absent two years later. The authors concluded that father absence seemed to be more of a cause than a consequence of child problem behaviour. Through direct interaction, fathers‚Äô involvement in children's development has a positive influence on their social, behavioural and psychological outcomes. In general, engagement of a fatherly figure reduces the frequency of behavioural problems and delinquency in sons and psychological problems in daughters, all the while facilitating children's cognitive development.  Theoretical approaches  = Evolutionary approach = Evolutionary life-history theory postulates that women may invest more in their offspring than the opposite gender due to a slower rate of reproduction in females.Trivers, R. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection . In B. Campbell (Ed.), Sexual selection and the descent of man (pp. 136-179). London: Heinemann. Some theorists add that the assured maternal relatedness to one's offspring may also make women invest more than men. This is because some men may have variable paternity confidence that the child is his offspring. = Psychodynamic approach = The psychodynamic approach posits that behaviour is motivated by basic needs, and drives and is sometimes shaped by unconscious childhood experiences. It is implicated that for a child to develop a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù gender identity, they will have to be raised in a conventional family where there is a father and a mother. Freud believed that being parented by a single mother could confuse the child's identity or lead them to become homosexual. Father absence may hinder the son's acquisition of the traditional masculine role, as he is not able to model his own behaviour and attitude on his fathers‚Äô. Along similar lines, sons with absent fathers could have confused gender identities ‚Äì if the son was separated from his father by age four, he would be less assertive, less involved in sport, less masculine than other boys and more dependent on his peers. Nevertheless, findings of certain empirical studies on psychosexual gender identification have been deemed contradictory and inconclusive. A number of studies have highlighted such negative consequences of the two- parent heterosexual household on children. Contrarily, others have pointed out that being reared in lesbian and single-parent households where the father was absent did not affect the psychosexual development of children, despite higher aggressiveness and submissiveness and lower assertiveness. = Biological approach = Genes and hormones may account for the tendency of fathers to be absent. Certain DNA patterns have been shown to affect an individual's degree of fidelity and investment in their offspring. In particular, a study in prairie voles indicates that the gene AVPR1A affects the activity of vasopressin receptors in brain regions and thus predicts less cheating on their partners. Similar to oxytocin, the hormone vasopressin can facilitate trust, empathy and social bonding. Injection of vasopressin in polygamous montane voles significantly increased their likelihood of becoming monogamous. This may in turn decrease their likelihood of being an absent father. A meta- analysis based on 56 twin and adoption studies totalling over 200,000 families has revealed that genetic makeup significantly affects the individual's parenting behaviour. Genes in the father reliability predict up to 40% of his positive or negative emotions towards his children. In this sense, genes contribute to a father's liking or repulsion for his children, the latter of which may result in father absence.  Gender differences  There is mixed empirical evidence on the relative impact of father absence on the development of male and female offspring. A recent study in rural Ethiopia, where father absence could mean a significant drop in household income, revealed a considerable difference between the wellbeing of male and female offspring. In particular, the author found that a male infant's risk of dying per month was doubled if the biological father was absent ‚Äì a 30% greater risk than that for females. For female infants, father absence (as opposed to presence) was associated with a lower risk of dying, as well as higher nutritional status. That is to say, father absence was only a statistical predictor of infant death only for male infants. Such a gender difference has been observed despite a strong cultural preference for sons in the area. On the other hand, in developed countries such as the United Kingdom where father absence may not inflict as much harm on the family's income, the effects of father absence are not noticeably gendered. = The Psychological Impacts on Men = When a young man matures without the biological male role model there are results in violent reactions to stress and emotions, resistance and hate towards authority, aggression, early rates of sexual encounters, transferences of moms negative talk about dad, and pressured ideologies to become the breadwinner. = The Psychological Impacts on Woman = Commonly agreed across Authors within literature on Fatherhood is the idea that ‚ÄúA girl‚Äôs relationship with her father serves as the model for all her relationships with men in her life, romantic and otherwise‚Ä¶‚Äù Many studies conducted produce the same result: that the absence of a father in a daughters life leads to increased promiscuity and sexualized activity. Most Famous being Ellis et al. study ‚ÄúDoes Father Absence Place Daughters at Special Risk for Early Sexual Activity and Teenage Pregnancy?‚Äù Ellis provides a greater focus on the timing of father absence in their daughters life; but still the results of promiscuity prove contingent on the father being present. From here, researchers have identified a commonality of 5 factors that work to explain how fatherlessness affects development in women, psychologically.  ‚Üí _A 5 Factors approach_  *The ‚ÄúUn- Factor‚Äù: Where first ideas of being ‚Äúunworthy‚Äù and / or ‚Äúunlovable‚Äù get developed in young woman. They begin to believe these things, creating a self fulfilled prophecy. One where they believe they are unworthy and thus only accept and attract love from men who fulfill their self thoughts of unworthiness about themselves. *The ‚ÄúTriple Fears Factor‚Äù: The three commonly identified fears (aka abandonment syndrome) shows fears of rejection, fears of abandonment and fears of commitment. Each fear initially identifiable in the early stages of life without a father. The fatherless woman can‚Äôt help but know the pain of being left. The whole of a father leaves a woman in her maturity automatically feeling abandoned and ‚Äúnot good enough‚Äù, bereaved uncertainty around what it means to be committed and received vs rejected. ‚ÄúUnfortunately being abandoned feels familiar and ‚Äòright‚Äô... and yet, I am terrified of being abandoned.‚Äù ‚ÄúUsually what these person will do is to play it safe to protect themselves; they will not put themselves in situations that are going to be intimate. They will be highly social, sexual, intellectual, but not intimate.‚Äù *The ‚ÄúSexual Healing Factor‚Äù: This factor is most commonly identified across woman of multiple age ranges and cultures for sexual expression tends to serve as primary indications of fatherlessness in a woman. The Sexual Healing Factor in girls and woman is primarily about control. The behavior exist amongst a spectrum ranging from promiscuity to a complete and utter avoidance to intimacy. In both extremes the girl is able to maintain a sense of control, deciding exactly what sex will look like for them. > ‚ÄúShe wants to be close but is afraid, she determined that she cannot be > intimate unless she is in control. She wants to be the one to decide the > positions for making love; she wants to be the one to decide when or if she > and her mate will get physical. She decides if she will have an orgasm, > regardless of how long the man may perform hoping to bring her to climax. > Because all of this places her in control, she does not confuse love and > intercourse. She presents an impenetrable, cool, or unaffected demeanor. But > these are merely defenses.‚Äù *The ‚ÄúOver Factor‚Äù: More explicitly defined as overeating, achieving etc but to the point where it can be identified as obsessive and addictive. *The ‚ÄúRAD Factor‚Äù Most commonly expressed as Rage, Anger, and Depression. Three emotions that have a tendency to be expressed or are identified as contributing to the emotional state of young woman without fathers.  Statistics  =United States= Based on the 2018 U.S. Census Bureau 11 million single parent households, 80% of them are fatherless, breaking down to 1 in every 4 children born; totaling a percentage of 81.5%. Out of that 81.5% that were raised by single mothers: > 34 % were poor 26.8 % were jobless the entire year 30.3 % suffered from > food insecurity ‚Öî of theses families were white. ‚Öì were black and ‚Öì were Hispanic defined. Not taking into account the 53% of American Indians and Alaskan Natives as well as the 17% Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders children recorded within these Single Parented homes. The US Department of Health and Human Services reports that the average experience of the American teenager includes now living in the absence of their father. This leads to multiple negative impacts on youth: > 85% are reported to have behavioral issues (Center for Disease Control) 71% > of high school dropouts and teen moms come from fatherless homes - 9 times > the national average (National Principals Association Report) 85% of all > children who show behavior disorders come from fatherless homes ‚Äì 20 times > the national average (Center for Disease Control) 85% of youth in prison > come from fatherless homes - 20 times the national average (Fulton Co. > Georgia, Texas Dept. of Correction) 63% of youth suicides are of children > who come from fatherless homes. - 5 times the national average (US > Department of Health/Census)  Specific negative impacts  Early pubertal timing ‚Äì precocious puberty ‚Äì is associated with negative outcomes in both genders. Early maturing girls have been found to be at risk for teenage pregnancy, drinking and weight problems, and giving birth to low birth weight infants. Early maturing boys are at risk for sexual promiscuity and delinquency and testicular and prostate cancer. Individual difference in pubertal timing may be influenced by weight, physical activity and genetics. = Menarche = A central event of female puberty ‚Äì menarche ‚Äì is associated with father absence. According to the evolutionary explanation, an unstable home environment (e.g. father absence) discourages a long-term mating life history, leading girls to adopt a short- term reproductive strategy, such as early menarche. This is because they perceive resources they have as scarce and, possibly, their lifespan to be shorter, under the influence of father absence. An early menarche can increase the chance of fertility, while other short-term reproductive strategies can diversify the genes inherited in offspring. These could lift up a higher success rate of rearing children to adolescence. Moreover, the stress of father absence prompts girls to develop a variety of internalising disorders, such as bulimia and depression, which may lower the person's metabolism leading to excessive weight gain which precipitates early menarche. A study shows that there are fewer monitored meals in the father-absent household. Having meals in the family is arguably more beneficial to children than is eating alone (i.e. solitary eating), as the former lowers the chance of obesity. However, it has been disputed whether the environmental stress of father absence stimulates weight gain, and thus accelerates early puberty. Likewise, the stress arisen from the absence of mother has been shown to have little influence on the child's body weight. Since mother absence does not predict weight gain in children, it seems that the increase in the child's body weight observed is due to the isolated genetic influence of an absent father, rather than the global environmental stress cause by the absence of either parent. This is possibly because in ancestral times the survival rate of children with mother being absent was extremely low. A specialised mechanism to deal with mother absence has never been developed. In addition, recent findings seem to regard genes, rather than the environment, as the mechanism underlying the positive correlation between high body mass index and earlier first menarche onset. Androgen receptor gene may predispose a father to impulsive and externalising behaviours (e.g. family abandonment) and his offspring to early puberty. The essentialness of androgen receptor to female fertility and ovary development has been proven by rodent studies. = Sexual behaviour = Father absence in a household can result in children (of both sexes) having earlier average ages of first sexual intercourse than those raised in father present households. There is also the effect of increased rates of teenage pregnancy. Some evolutionary theories propose that early childhood is vital for encoding information that shapes future reproductive strategies in regulating physical and motivational pathways of sexual behaviour. Conflicting and stressful parental relationships can lead children to believe that resources are limited, people are untrustworthy, and relationships are opportunistic. As they replicate their parents‚Äô mating- oriented reproductive behaviour, they tend to have multiple sexual partners and erratic relationships. Children implicitly and explicitly model their sexual attitudes and behaviours on their parents, see engagement in non- marital sex as normative. Father absence however can be a byproduct of initial social and economic strain within the household (e.g. violence, lack of educational opportunities and cumulative life exposure to poverty can increase the likelihood of early sexual endeavours and pregnancy). The timing of first intercourse can be heritable - shorter alleles of the X-linked androgen receptor (AR) gene has been associated with aggression, impulsivity, high number of sexual partners, divorce in males and earlier ages of physical maturation in females.  Mechanisms to balance father absence  = Matrilineal support = A study in Ethiopia in 2008 found that despite being poorer overall, widowed and divorced women are on average 2.4 kg heavier than women whose children's fathers are present. Widowed and divorced mothers as well as their daughters are reported to have substantially improved nutritional status which could be explained by them having greater access to the mother's relatives (matrilateral kin). Furthermore, proximity to a mother's relatives can dramatically improve female children's height for age, an indicator of good nutrition. Women who return to their village of birth following marital dissolution are seen to benefit from extra matrilateral kin support, = Presence of a stepfather = In light of certain research, father absence can be disadvantageous; certain evidence suggests stepfather presence does not reduce these disadvantages but in fact has a worsening effect on such issues. For example, the Cinderella effect, which refers to the observation that stepchildren are at a dramatically increased risk of physical abuse and homicide than children living with their biological parents. Although there researchers have found a negative relationship between stepmothers and food expenditure, this effect is not observed with stepfathers and their stepchildren. Ellis and Garber (2000) and Ellis (2004) suggest that stepfather presence is a better predictor of age of menarche than father absence, as it indicates lower quality paternal investment. In accordance with their findings, results show that girls raised in families with stepfathers exhibit a significantly earlier age of menarche than girls raised without stepfathers. Relative to other groups, children with a constantly absent biological father but a stepfather present reported more frequent incidences of sexual intercourse, as well as an earlier onset of sexual behaviour. The mean age of children with their biological father absent or partially absent is approximately 15. A higher percentage of children with a constantly absent biological father reported having sexual intercourse than those in the partially absent group. Those with a stepfather present and those with a biological father always absent have the earliest first time experiences of sexual intercourse at on average 15.11 years old, whereas children without a stepfather or their biological father partially absent at the age of 15.38 experience their first encounter of sexual intercourse. The effect of having a partially absent biological father with stepfather absence and the effect both stepfather or biological father absence are the same. This study indicated that the presence of a stepfather is not compensating to the disadvantages of a biological father being absent. In some situations, it can cause an even bigger negative effect on children. = No agreement upon effective client treatment = Choice of effective treatment can be greatly varied and thus can be affected by many factors such as age, one's ability to understand and deal with emotionally heavy material, family members involvement and the family and child's priorities and needs. In treating some of the negative effects that young girls may have, transference to a male therapist could help facilitate the opportunity to fill any emotional void created through father absence. On the other hand, simply through the existence of a connection with a consistent and empathetic adult can provide some paternal function, regardless of gender.

The first Quality Dairy Store was opened in 1936 and as of 2020 there are 29 Mid-Michigan area retail locations. Quality Dairy Company's headquarters is located near REO Town in Lansing and operates its Dairy Plant, Bakery Plant, and Injection Plastic Molding Plant from central Lansing as well. Quality Dairy has been one of Mid-Michigan's largest employers for over 50 years and produces over 150 different products in its Lansing area facilities. The chain caters primarily to neighborhood clientele, many of whom do not have the benefit of personal transportation. Quality Dairy draws customers with \\"loss leader\\" prices on staples such as milk, eggs and bread, but makes its profits from sales of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, snack foods and beverages, lottery tickets, and other convenience items sold at premium prices. History Quality Dairy Company was founded in March 1936 by Gregory J. Martin and Harvey Mack. The first store was located at 1406 South Washington Avenue. At the time, milk was most commonly obtained by home delivery. The original company mission included providing bottled milk on a cash and carry basis from small neighborhood milk stores. The price of milk at the time was seven cents a quart. In 1940, Quality Dairy Company started producing, distributing, and selling ice cream. Quality Dairy stores also began to sell candy and gum around the same time. Since then, the stores have greatly expanded the offering of grocery items, adding cereals, soups, canned vegetables and fruits, snacks and more, along with a selection of meat, cheese and frozen food items not typically found outside the major grocery stores. Dipped ice cream was added in 1969. In 1955, Quality Dairy Company‚Äôs ownership changed. Harvey Mack sold out to Mr. Martin who brought in 3 additional family owners shortly thereafter. Currently Quality Dairy Company operates 31 stores throughout Greater Lansing. All but two locations sell beer and wine and sixteen locations sell packaged liquor. Eight locations offer gasoline and six stores have Laundromats. In addition to retail stores, Quality Dairy Company operates several production and distribution facilities including the Dairy Plant, Bakery, Commissary and Grocery Distribution Center. QDC Plastic Container, a division of Quality Dairy Company, is a plastics blow molding facility which services the drink industry. In 2017, the Holt location was temporarily closed because of an electrical fire. The store was renovated with a streamlined design and drive-thru window, patio, walk-up window, and arctic beer cave among other new features. The store re-opened in August 2019.

Today Quality Dairy distributes milk from local dairy farms to its 28 stores daily. They also produce flavored milks, juices, fruit drinks, chip dip and more, all of which are distributed from their central hub - Quality Dairy Central - Located just south of Lansing's REO Town. They also offer their own Premium Ice Creams in a variety of flavors. Quality Dairy Bakery Quality Dairy Bakery Plant The Quality Dairy Bakery started in 1970 in the back room of one of the stores. Not long after, the Bakery outgrew that space and moved to a new larger location. Today, the Bakery is housed in a 37,000 sq. ft. facility in Lansing. The Quality Dairy Commissary operates in the same facility. The Bakery produces over 40 varieties of donuts, including classic cake donuts and yeast- raised varieties. It also offer cookies, muffins, pastries, and other baked goods. Customers can also order Bakery products online and have them delivered to any retail store. Quality Dairy Commissary Quality Dairy Commissary The Quality Dairy Commissary was founded in the mid-1970s. It is currently operating in the same modern 37,000 sq. ft. facility as the Bakery. The Commissary provides a wide variety of food items to the stores five days a week. It produces over three dozen varieties of sandwiches as well as wraps and salads. The Commissary also supplies the stores with a selection of fresh produce.

It is often used with microphone signals in professional audio. Star-quad cable cross-section Star-quad exploded view showing the geometric centers of the dual-conductors used for each leg of the balanced line. To achieve magnetic immunity, geometric centers of both dual-conductors must be aligned to a common point. Star-quad cable is a four conductor cable that has a special quadrupole geometry that provides magnetic immunity when used in a balanced line. Four conductors are used to carry the two legs of the balanced line. All four conductors must be an equal distance from a common point (usually the center of a cable). The four conductors are arranged in a four- pointed star (forming a square). Opposite points of the star are connected together at each end of the cable to form each leg of the balanced circuit. Star quad cables often use filler elements to hold the conductor centers in a symmetric four-point arrangement about the cable axis. All points of the star must lie at equal distances from the center of the star. When opposite points are connected together they act as if they are one conductor located at the center of the star. This configuration places the geometric center of each of the two legs of the balanced circuit in the center of the star. To a magnetic field, both legs of the balanced circuit appear to be in the exact center of the star. This means that both legs of the balanced circuit will receive exactly the same interference from the magnetic field and a common-mode interference signal will be produced. This common-mode interference signal will be rejected by the balanced receiver. The magnetic immunity of star quad cable is a function of the accuracy of the star-quad geometry, the accuracy of the impedance balancing, and the common-mode rejection ratio of the balanced receiver.The Importance of Star-Quad Microphone Cable Star-quad cable typically provides a 10 dB to 30 dB reductionEvaluating Microphone Cable Performance & Specifications in magnetically-induced interference.The Star Quad StoryWhat's Special About Star-Quad Cable?How Starquad Works Advantages When star-quad cable is used for a single balanced line, such as professional audio applications and two-wire telephony, two non-adjacent conductors are terminated together at both ends of the cable, and the other two conductors are also terminated together. Interference picked up by the cable arrives as a virtually perfect common mode signal, which is easily removed by a coupling transformer or differential amplifier. The combined benefits of twisting, differential signalling, and quadrupole pattern give outstanding noise immunity, especially advantageous for low signal level applications such as long microphone cables, even when installed very close to a power cable. It is particularly beneficial compared to twisted pair when AC magnetic field sources are in close proximity, for example a stage cable that can lie against an inline power transformer. Disadvantages The disadvantage is that star quad, in combining two conductors, typically has more capacitance than similar two-conductor twisted and shielded audio cable. High capacitance causes an increasing loss of high frequencies as distance increases. The high-frequency loss is due to the RC filter formed by the output impedance of the cable driver and the capacitance of the cable. In some cases an increase in distortion can occur in the cable driver if it has difficulty driving the higher cable capacitance. The capacitance of a 4 conductor quad-star cable is roughly equal to the capacitance of a standard 2 conductor cable about 1.5 times as long. The increased capacitance of the star quad cable is not usually a problem with short cable runs, but it can be an issue for long cable runs. For example, an 8 m (25 ft) star-quad cable has a capacitance of 150 pF/m for a total capacitance of 1200 pF for the entire length of cable. With a 150 Ohm source impedance and 1200 pF load capacitance, the frequency response of this RC circuit is -0.02 dB at 20 kHz. If the cable was 80 m instead of 8 m, then the frequency response would be -0.2 dB at 20 kHz, and -3 dB at 88 kHz. Other applications for star quad cable While the above discussion focuses on preventing noise from getting in (e.g. into a microphone cable) the same star-quad quadrupole configuration is useful for audio speaker cable,Canare 4S11 Star Quad Speaker Cable Specifications for split-phase electric power wiring, and even for open-wire star quad transmission line. In these cases, the purpose of the star quad configuration is reversed. The star-quad geometry cancels the magnetic fields that are produced by the two pairs of conductors. This cancellation reduces the magnetic emissions of the cable. To work properly, the cable must be wired in the same fashion as the microphone cable example above. Wires on opposite sides of the star must be shorted together at each end of the cable. This means that 4 conductors are required for a two-wire circuit. Furthermore, this scheme only works if the two pairs of conductors carry equal and opposite currents. If a ground conductor is also needed, it must be added in a way that will not interfere with the star-quad geometry. It should also be added in a geometric configuration that exposes the ground conductor to equal interference from all four star-quad conductors. The most common solution is to wrap the star quad with a cylindrical ground conductor. Star-quad cable can be used for two circuits, such as four-wire telephony and other telecommunications applications, but it will not provide magnetic immunity in this application. In this configuration each pair uses two non-adjacent conductors. Because the conductors are always the same distance from each other, crosstalk is reduced relative to cables with two separate twisted pairs. Each conductor of one pair sees an equal capacitance to both wires in the other pair. This cancels the capacitive crosstalk between the two pairs. The geometry also cancels the magnetic interference between the two pairs.

The Jenks Tavern, also known historically as the East Rupert Hotel and the Hotel G. Jenks, is a historic public accommodations house at the junction of West Dorset Road with Vermont Routes 315 and 30 in Rupert, Vermont. Built about 1807, it is a well-preserved example of an early 19th-century traveler's accommodation in southern Vermont. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The building is now a private residence. Description and history The former Jenks Tavern is located in the village of East Rupert, overlooking the Mettawee River not far from the town line with Dorset. The tavern stands on a roughly parcel bounded on the north by Rupert Mountain Road (Vermont Route 315), the east by Vermont Route 30, and the west by West Dorset Road. The building is oriented facing west. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. A single-story ell extends to the rear (toward Route 30). The main facade is covered by a two-story porch, and is five bays wide with doors at the center of each level. Windows are double-hung sash throughout, with a pair of windows in the gables at the sides. The interior follows a typical center hall plan, with a large sprung floor ballroom on the attic level. The tavern was built about 1807 by James Moore, Jr., and was originally attached to an older tavern building that has since been torn down. His purchase and construction were occasioned by the completion of the Rupert Turnpike (now roughly Vermont 315), which connected Pawlet, Vermont and Salem, New York. It was also originally attached to a barn, which was demolished in 1948 when Route 30 was realigned. The building was regularly (but not continuously) in use as a traveler's accommodation, and was widely known in the region for the high quality of the dance floor in its ballroom. This type of tavern was once common in southwestern Vermont, but this is now one of a few little-altered examples to survive. It has been either vacant or a private residence since the 1930s.

She was the daughter of Xhemal Pasha Zogu and Sadij√© Toptani, his second wife, and was the third of six sisters of King Zog I of Albania. When her brother became monarch in 1928, she and her siblings were granted the status of Prince and Princess Zogu. She was the chairperson of the Albanian Red Cross and the women's organisation Gruaja Shiqiptare in 1928‚Äì1939. Life Princess Senije (Xenia) was described as the favorite sister of Zog I, and the affection was reportedly mutual. After the death of the queen mother, Princess Senije performed the representational duties of first lady until the marriage of her brother to queen Geraldine in 1938. Public life In contrast to his two eldest sisters, Princess Adile Zogu and Nafije Zogu, who was seldom seen in public, the king gave his four younger sisters official roles to play in the royal representation. During the first years of his reign, the princesses lived a traditional isolated life in the royal palace complex and seldom appeared outside of the family circle, but this changed by the time of the wedding of Princess Senije in 1936. Her wedding was a public affair, and from that year onward, the king regularly arranged formal royal balls, and had his four younger sisters appear in public on official royal representational assignments: Senije was assigned tasks within health care, Ruhije Zogu education, Myzejen Zogu culture, and Maxhide Zogu attended to tasks within sports. To prepare them for this task, they were given lessons in piano playing, dance, language and riding, and were sent for several trips to Western Europe, where they became known for their expensive shopping trips. When the king banned the hijab in 1937, he made sure his sisters appeared in public without veils and dressed in Western fashion as role models for other women. Princess Senije was appointed chairperson of the Albanian Red Cross by the king in October 1928. The same year, the king abolished all women's organisations in Albania, and replaced them with a single woman's organisation controlled by the state, the Gruaja Shiqiptare. This organisation was to be chaired by the chairperson of the Albanian Red Cross, who was, in turn, to be appointed by the monarch, and Princess Senije consequently became the chairperson of the Gruaja Shiqiptare. The task of this state woman's organisation was to support the official policy within women's rights rather than to act independently. The government policy was however radical, as the Civil Code of 1928 stated that women had equal right to inheritance and divorce, abolished arranged and forced marriage and polygamy and gave women the right to education and a professional life. Under Princess Senije, the Gruaja Shiqiptare founded local branches in 20 cities, published its own paper and supported numerous projects in support of the regime's women's policy, especially regarding education; in reality, however, the work did not manage to achieve much success outside of the cosmopolitan elite of the cities. When the king searched for a spouse in the late 1930s, his sister was given the task to attend balls in Europe in search of a bride among the European nobility. In 1937, Princess Senije, on the king's request, invited the future Geraldine of Albania to the new's years eve ball at the royal palace of Tirana, where he proposed to her. Prior to the royal wedding in 1938, the three youngest princesses made a trip to the USA, where they were given much attention, but Senije did not accompany them. Exile Princess Senije left Albania with the rest of the royal family in 1939 upon the outbreak of World War II, and followed the former monarch in exile to Great Britain in 1940. She, as well as the rest of the sisters except Adile, followed Zog to Egypt in 1946. In Egypt, she and Princess Myzejen, in particular, kept in contact with the Albanian colony there. In 1955, she and the rest of the family followed Zog to France, where he died. She lived in France with her sisters until her death. Princess Senije married Prince ≈ûehzade Mehmed Abid (1905‚Äì1973), son of Abdul Hamid II, in 1936, and divorced him in 1949. They had no children.

Its A (17 kDa; Q8X1M9) and B (59 kDa; Q5W9E8) components are assembled into a transmembrane pore complex. The Pleurotolysin Pore-Forming (Pleurotolysin) Family (TC# 1.C.97) is a family of pore forming proteins belonging to the MACPF superfamily.  Function  Proteins with membrane-attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domains have a variety of biological roles, including defense and attack, organismal development, and cell adhesion and signaling. The distribution of these proteins in fungi appears to be restricted to some Pezizomycotina and Basidiomycota species only, in correlation with the aegerolysins (PF06355). These two protein groups coincide in only a few species, and they operate as cytolytic bi-component pore-forming agents. Representative proteins include pleurotolysin B, which has a MACPF domain, the aegerolysin-like protein pleurotolysin A, and the very similar ostreolysin A (TC# 1.C.97.3.2) that has been purified from oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus). These act in concert to perforate natural and artificial lipid membranes with high cholesterol and sphingomyelin contents. The complex has a 13-meric rosette-like structure with a central lumen that is ~ 4-5 nm in diameter. The opened transmembrane pore is non-selectively permeable to ions and smaller neutral solutes, and is a cause of cytolysis of a colloid-osmotic type.  Research  Sakurai et al. 2004 cloned complementary and genomic DNAs encoding pleurotolysin, and studied pore-forming properties of recombinant proteins. Recombinant pleurotolysin A lacking the first methionine was purified as a 17-kDa protein with sphingomyelin-binding activity. The cDNA for pleurotolysin B encoded a precursor consisting of 523 amino acyl residues, of which 48 N-terminal amino acyl residues were absent in natural pleurotolysin B. Mature and precursor forms of pleurotolysin B were expressed as insoluble 59- and 63-kDa proteins, respectively. Although neither recombinant pleurotolysin A nor B alone was hemolytically active at higher concentrations of up to 100 mg/ml, they cooperatively assembled into a membrane pore complex on human erythrocytes and lysed the cell.  Homologues  In this TC family, both constituents of pleurotolysin and ostreolysin (A and B) are included under TC#s 1.C.97.1.1 and 1.C.97.1.2, respectively. However, homologues of Pleurotolysin B are found under TC#s 1.C.97.1.3 - 1.C.97.1.9 while homologues of Pleurotolysin A are found under TC#s 1.C.97.2.1 - 1.C.97.2.4 and TC#s 1.C.97.3.1 - 1.C.97.3.8. Pleurotolysins A are not homologous to Pleurotolysins B. While some homologues depend on the presence of both constituents for pore formation, as noted for both pleurotolysin and ostreolysin, some homologues of both A and B can form pores without the other. While Pleurotolysin B is in the MACPF superfamily (TC# 1.C.39) while Pleurotolysin A is in the Aegerolysin superfamily. = Erylysin = Another two-component hemolysin, erylysin A and B (EryA and EryB; TC# 1.C.97.1.2), was isolated from an edible mushroom, Pleurotus eryngii. Hemolytic activity was exhibited only by the EryA and EryB mixture.  Aegerolysin  While Pleurotolysin B is in the MACPF superfamily (TC# 1.C.39), Pleurotolysin A is in the Aegerolysin superfamily. Several members of the Aegerolysin family have been used as tools to detect and visualize ceramide phosphoethanolamine, a major sphingolipid in invertebrates but not in animals. It may be distantly related to members of the Equinatoxin Family (TC# 1.C.38). The aegerolysin family consists of several bacterial and eukaryotic aegerolysin-like proteins. It has been found that aegerolysin and ostreolysin are expressed during formation of primordia and fruiting bodies and possibly play a role in the initial phase of fungal fruiting. The bacterial members of this family are expressed during sporulation. Ostreolysin is cytolytic to various erythrocytes and tumor cells because of pore formation. Several members of the Aegerolysin family have been used as tools to detect and visualize ceramide phosphoethanolamine, a major sphingolipid in invertebrates but not in animals.

Yarrow Parish Kirk The old name of the parish was St. Mary's or, in some records, St Mary of the Lowes, from its vicinity to two considerable lochs (Loch of the Lowes and St. Mary‚Äôs Loch). In the year 1640, the parish church was moved from the vicinity of St. Mary‚Äôs Loch to the banks of the Yarrow, which henceforth imparted its name to the parish. This site was adjacent to a pre-reformation chapel at Deuchar. However, the glebe remained on the north side of the loch, the same that was attached to St Mary's Chapel, now eight miles to the west of the kirk to which it belonged. The kirk was renovated in 1826, 1876 and 1906. However its interior was destroyed by fire in 1922, but restored following year. The area of the parish of Yarrow was formerly one of the most extensive in the south of Scotland, encompassing most of the valley of the Yarrow and a considerable part of that of the Ettrick. The shape was very irregular and, although the population was low (1,264 in 1841), it was difficult for the minister of the parish to reach many of them, both as regards distance and the want of roads and bridges. To ameliorate this problem, the Duke of Buccleuch in 1851 instigated proceedings to have the southern part, in the Ettrick valley, disjoined from the parish and erected into a separate parish. The duke proposed to make over the chapel at Ettrickbridge, which he had built in 1839, to be the church of the new parish, to erect a suitable manse for the minister, and to bear the expense of the judicial separation proceedings. The new parish would extend to 9 miles in length up the river Ettrick, be about 6 miles wide, with an area of about 50 square miles, population 600. The remaining portion of the parish of Yarrow would contain a population of about 670, extending in length to about 19 miles, and in breadth. The new parish was created and named Kirkhope, an old name for the Ettrickbridge area Statistical History Of Scotland, by James Hooper Dawson,Edinburgh 1857 (article on Yarrow parish) Thus the population of Yarrow Parish had reduced from 1,270 to 600 by this separation and it would fall further to 500 in 1901 and 402 in 1951.1951 Census of Great Britain In 1891 the Boundary Commissioners transferred the Megget district from the Peeblesshire parish of Lyne and Megget to Yarrow (while Yarrow lost some detached and outlying parts to Peeblesshire parishes). The Megget valley lies to the west of St. Mary‚Äôs Loch and Megget Water feeds into that loch. Much of the valley was flooded by Megget reservoir which was opened in September 1983.

The sand tampan is an ectoparasite on humans, their livestock and wild animals, including birds and bats. Occurring in semi-desert areas of Africa, Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Persian Gulf, India, Sri Lanka and into Asia, it is able to survive for lengthy periods without feeding, spending most of its life burrowed under sand or loose soil, often in wait for animals that rest or sleep under trees or in the lee of rocks, but also in places where people or their animals congregate such as marketplaces, places of worship, cattle kraals and village squares. The timing of its activity is geared to coincide with that of potential hosts, but hot sunny conditions are usually avoided.http://libraries.sta.uwi.edu/journals/ojs/index.php/wivj/article/view/165 Because of its habit of feeding and dropping from its host, adult dispersal is limited, whereas larvae may remain attached to their hosts for several days. During its life cycle it will feed on multiple hosts between moults. This species is of interest because of the pathogens it carries, and its salivary apyrases which prevent platelet activation and aggregation, that is, blood- clotting.http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Campaigns/Alkhurma/Documents/study04.pdf In humans the tick may cause dermatitis, fever and lymphadenitis.http://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/PINSA/Vol46B_1980_6_Art16.pdf It is also a carrier of Borrelia, a spirochaete bacterium, and is a carrier of a flavivirus causing Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHFV). The closely related Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is endemic to certain regions of India. That AHFV and KFDV diverged some 700 years ago would suggest that unknown tick-borne hemorrhagic/encephalitic viruses may exist between Saudi Arabia and India. Soft ticks of the family Argasidae lack the hard scutum or shield present in hard ticks of the family Ixodidae. Their gnathosoma or mouth structure is located on the underside of the body and is not readily visible. Their feeding method differs from that of the hard ticks in that they do not embed a capitulum in the host, but make an incision through the skin and sip the oozing blood. The feeding lasts up to 30 minutes during which time their body weight may increase as much as tenfold. Sand tampans by their concerted attack in large numbers are able to paralyse and kill sizeable mammals, especially penned livestock, by introducing toxins during feeding, mainly through coxal gland secretions, leading to symptoms similar to those of anaphylactic shock in older animals.http://www.jsava.co.za/index.php/jsava/article/download/1255/1629 These toxins affect the cardiac system, causing Mobitz type atrial-ventricular blocks and ventricular tachycardia. The defensins employed by O. savignyi are being studied for developing multifunctional peptides - shorter peptides derived from the defensin isoform 2 (OsDef2) have useful antibacterial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties. Ornithodoros spp are found worldwide in semi-arid regions, living in burrows, caves, dens, cliffsides, and bird colonies. O. savignyi and O. coriaceus are exceptional in having eyes. O. coriaceus occurs under hillside scrub oak from northern California and Nevada to Mexico, in deer beds under trees and in the lee of large rocks. O. gurneyi favours tree-shaded sand in the deserts of Australia, resting places of kangaroos and people. O. porcinus is found on warthogs, bushpigs and other pig species and occurs throughout Africa in suitable habitats - it plays a role in transmitting the virus causing African swine fever which in 2013 was found 35 km north of Pretoria. A salticid spider, Phidippus rimator, has been recorded from northern California as predating Ornithodoros coriaceus and is only the second predator recorded for this species. O. savignyi was named after the zoologist Marie Jules C√©sar Lelorgne de Savigny, a contemporary of Jean Victoire Audouin's. Since they are attracted by carbon dioxide, dry ice may be used for their collection, or they may be sifted from the soil. Ornithodoros tampans also fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Distribution The extensive distribution of this species from Africa to Asia strongly suggests anthropogenic origins. \\"Dispersal of the ancestral viruses of AHFV and KFDV may have been accomplished through the movement of animals, including camels presumably carrying ticks, along the Silk Road, which by the 1300s stretched from Europe to China.\\" Mating behaviour The coxal secretion of adult female ticks, appearing during and after a blood meal, contains a sex pheromone provoking a mating response from males. Mating occurs off the host, hard ticks doing so on the host animal. Females lay a few hundred eggs in several batches, and may do so for several seasons‚Äîadults of Ornithodoros erraticus can live for 15‚Äì20 years (Encinas Grandes et al. 1993). There is little seasonal fluctuation in their numbers as their microhabitats are quite stable. Chemical and vaccine control Attempted chemical control of tampans by poisoning leads inevitably to their acquiring resistance and immunity to the drugs used. The long-term damage done to the environment by use of such chemicals outweighs any short-term benefits that may accrue. Natural controls in the form of pathogens, predators and parasites are sufficient to curb tampan numbers.

She earned her PhD in social anthropology in 2013 at the University of Oslo with the thesis Designing Elites: Fashion and Prestige in Urban North India. She was a student of Thomas Hylland Eriksen and is an emerging voice in Scandinavian anthropology. From 2016-2018, she is a Visiting Senior Researcher at the Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology at the University of Vienna. In 2016, her monograph Luxury Indian Fashion: A Social Critique was published by Bloomsbury Publishing. Her book is the first ethnographic study of the Indian luxury fashion industry and is unique in its ethnographic focus on the Indian elites and the interactions between fashion designers and craftspeople. The book presents a class analysis focusing on understanding how social and economic inequality is reproduced through everyday encounters and practices within the complex networks and interdependencies of the Indian fashion industry. Kuldov√° is also the editor of a volume Fashion India: Spectacular Capitalism published in 2013 (Oslo: Akademika Publishing). The volume accompanied an ethnographic exhibition, based on Kuldov√°'s research in India, which she both curated and designed. The exhibition was entitled 'Fashion India' and was inaugurated on 13 September 2013 at the Historical Museum in Oslo and was on show for a whole year. The opening event was covered widely by television and media in Norway and was attended by more than 700 visitors on the first day. Kuldov√° has argued that researching fashion means primarily researching social and economic inequalities, and therefore it should no longer be a marginal topic of study. In her academic article on exhibiting fashion in museums she argued for a rethinking of the current mainstream practices of displaying fashion. She argued that her own exhibition 'Fashion India' was conceptualized as a critique of current museum practices. In her article she outlines some themes of this exhibition that address uncritical approaches, which use the ‚Äòaesthetic‚Äô to mask hierarchies of power. These include the problems of exhibiting fashion as art, corporate and private sponsorships, fashion designers as co-curators, spectacular exhibition design (form) over content, and persistent policies of infantilization and patronage of the audiences. In 2015 she received a Peder Sather Grant from the University of California, Berkeley for a new exploratory research project entitled \\"Gangs, Brands and Intellectual Property Rights: A Comparative Study of the Transnational Business Organization of Outlaw Bikers and Luxury Brands through the Lens of their Legal Battles against Piracy.\\" In December 2015, she was awarded a major research grant by the Norwegian Research Council for a 3-year research project which built on the aforementioned project in collaboration with UC Berkeley, entitled \\"Gangs, Brands and Intellectual Property Rights: Interdisciplinary Comparative Study of Outlaw Motorcycle Clubs and Luxury Brands.\\" She authored the article 'Hells Angels‚Ñ¢ Motorcycle Corporation in the Fashion Business: Interrogating the Fetishism of the Trademark Law' which appeared in the Journal of Design History in 2016. She is also the co-editor of the volume Outlaw Motorcycle Clubs and Street Gangs: Scheming Legality, Resisting Criminalization, co-edited with Mart√≠n S√°nchez-Jankowski, a UC Berkeley sociologist. She has also published extensively on the questions of philanthropy and the 'trouble with benevolence.' In 2019, her second monograph How Outlaws Win Friends and Influence People, asking the critical question of our times: why an increasing number of people support, admire and aspire to be outlaws, was published.

The book was published by Albert Whitman & Company in 2005, but was banned in several states due to its content. It was the fourth most censored book in the United States in 2011 and is regarded as a highly controversial piece of children's literature. Plot My Mom's Having a Baby is narrated by a young girl named Elizabeth whose mother is pregnant with another child. Elizabeth takes the reader through the nine months of her mother's pregnancy and explains everything that she learns along the way. At first Elizabeth learns about doctor's visits and ultrasounds, and eventually she learns the facts of life from her mother. When Elizabeth's mother is in the hospital having the baby Elizabeth stays with her grandmother, and in the end Elizabeth is thrilled to introduce her new little brother Michael. Censorship My Mom's Having a Baby was censored in Oregon, Indiana, Kansas, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, Texas, and Florida. It was the fourth most censored book in the United States in 2011, and was censored for nudity, sex education, and unsuitability to the age group. The book contains nudity in order to provide a detailed description of how babies are created. The amount of detail in the explanation provided in the story has created controversy among parents due to the accuracy with which Butler describes the act of sex. The illustrations are controversial because they depict both male and female nudity, as well as the parents together under the covers in a way that implies they are having sex. In an interview with Fox News, Butler defended her work by stating that it is in the children's non-fiction section along with other explanatory children's books about childbirth, disease, and war. She stated that her book was meant to be explained to a child by a parent, and that parents should not assume that every book in the children's section can or should be read without supervision. Awards My Mom's Having a Baby received a starred review from Booklist, and was Booklist Editor's Choice Book for 2005 directly after its publication. It is also a Top Ten Science - Technology award winner. Butler states in her post as a guest blogger on Write All the Words! that she explained sex to her children in the very same way that she explains it in the book.

She was a renowned painter, poet, and composer. She received the name Xianglan because her most favored paintings were of orchids.  Biography  Ma was born in Nanjing, and she lived in the entertainment district along the Qinhuai River. As a matriarch in courtesan society, she encouraged the education and training of courtesans in the arts. In order to maintain her reputation as an elite courtesan, she only allowed educated men or young student lords within her residence. During the late Ming dynasty, elite courtesans challenged the gender stereotypes of Confucian values. In contrast to the women of the gentry, who were often discouraged from cultivating talent lest it undermine their virtue as wives and mothers, courtesans were educated in painting, poetry, and music. In addition, they owned property and participated in the public scene. At the age of 15, Ma Shouzhen formally assumed the position of courtesan. Before this, she may have received education from a proprietor who owned her during her childhood. As courtesan matriarch, she befriended many poets and intellects such as Peng Nian (1505‚Äì1566), Zhou Tianqiu (1514‚Äì1595), Xu Wei (1521‚Äì1593), Xue Mingyi (late 16th century), and Wang Zhideng (1535‚Äì1612). The poets would write poems inspired by her or for her, describing Ma as beautiful with a warm and welcoming personality. During their visits, Ma Shouzhen joined them in making paintings, poems, and plays. She also hosted parties on her multi-leveled house-boat with the literati as her guests.  Romance with Wang Zhideng  Ma Shouzhen and Wang Zhideng shared a loving relationship with one another, and there are instances in which the two openly expressed their affection for each other. They wrote letters to each other, collaborated in several paintings and poem. One of their famous collaborations was Narcissus and Rock, which consists of two images and a poem. When Ma published her poems in 1591, Wang included a preface for them. On one occasion, Ma took her house-boat to see Wang in Suzhou and celebrated his 70th birthday with a party of musicians. Not long after this, Ma fell ill and died peacefully in her residence in Nanjing. Wang wrote several eulogies of Ma after her death.  Paintings and Poetry  As a painter, Ma Shouzhen is well known for landscapes, orchids, and bamboo imagery combined with calligraphy. Her brush work is delicate, and the images have either colors lightly applied or monochromatic ink. Her preferred painting formats include fan, hand-scrolls, and hanging scrolls. Along with painting, Ma was skilled in writing poetry and composing dramas, however, some of her dramas have been lost over time. The only paintings by Ma Shouzhen that survive today are her ink landscapes, orchids, and bamboo. Since she was a social person, many of her paintings may have been given away at parties.

It is one of the largest gas transmission systems in the world. The system is linked with natural gas transmission systems of Russia and Belarus on one hand, and with systems of Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary and Slovakia on other hand. The system is owned by Government of Ukraine and operated by Ukrtransgaz. Some local transmission lines together with distribution sets are owned by regional gas companies. History The development of Ukrainian gas pipeline system started in Galicia, then part of Poland. The first gas pipeline was Boryslav‚ÄìDrohobych pipeline in 1912. In 1924, after discovery of the Dashava gas field the Dashava‚ÄìStryi‚ÄìDrohobych gas pipeline was constructed. In 1928, the Dashava‚ÄìLviv and in 1937, the Dashava‚ÄìTarn√≥w pipelines were built. After Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia, the Dashava‚ÄìTarn√≥w pipeline became the first cross-border pipeline of the Soviet Union. the Opory‚ÄìBoryslav and Opory‚ÄìLviv pipelines were built in 1940‚Äì1941. The current Ukrainian transmission system was built as an integrated part of the unified gas supply system of the former Soviet Union. In 1940‚Äì1960s, it was mainly built to use the Galician gas in other regions of the Soviet Union. In 1948, the Dashava‚ÄìKyiv pipeline which was the largest pipeline that time in Europe, was launched. In 1951, Dashava‚ÄìKyiv pipeline was prolonged to Bryansk and Moscow. In 1955, construction of the Dashava‚ÄìMinsk pipeline started, which later was prolonged to Vilnius and Riga. It was completed in 1960. After discovery of the Shebelinka gas field in 1956, the Shebelinka‚ÄìKharkiv pipeline and the Shebelinka‚ÄìDnipropetrovsk‚ÄìKryvyi Rih‚ÄìOdessa pipeline with branches to Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv and Kherson were completed in 1966. This southern corridor was prolonged to Moldova and later to Southeast Europe between 1974 and 1978. The Shebelinka‚ÄìKyiv pipeline with branches to Poltava and Kremenchuk was completed in 1969. In 1970‚Äì1974, it was prolonged to the Western border. Also the Shebelinka‚ÄìBelgorod‚ÄìKursk‚ÄìBryansk pipelines was built. In 1964, the first underground gas storage in Ukraine, the Olyshevske gas storage, was commissioned. In 1970‚Äì1980s, the Ukrainian gas transmission system was developed as a gas export route to Europe. The first large-scale export pipeline, the Dolyna‚ÄìUzhhorod‚ÄìWestern border pipeline, became operational in 1967. It was the first stage of the Bratstvo (Brotherhood) pipeline system. In 1978, the Soyuz pipeline (Orenburg‚ÄìWestern border pipeline) was built as the first Soviet natural gas export pipeline. It followed by the Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhhorod pipeline in 1983 (now also named as Bratstvo or Brotherhood pipeline) and the Progress pipeline (Yamburg‚ÄìWestern border pipeline) in 1988. Between 1986 and 2001, the Yelets‚ÄìKremenchuk‚ÄìAnanyiv‚ÄìTiraspol‚ÄìIzmail rote was developed. Technical description The natural gas transmission system of Ukraine consists of of pipelines, including of trunk pipelines and of branch pipelines. In addition, the system includes 72 compressor stations with 702 compressors, having a total capacity of 5,442.9 MW, and 13 underground gas storage facilities with an active storage capacity of . As of 2009, the system had import capacity of and export capacity of per year. Before 2012, gas entered to Ukraine only from entry points on borders with Russia and Belarus. Most of the gas transit went to Slovakia and further to other countries in Central and Western Europe. Smaller amount of natural gas was transported to Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Moldova. In 2012‚Äì2014, some entry/exit points with Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia were modified to allow also reverse gas flow from these countries to Ukraine. The value of the Ukrainian transmission system is estimated at US$9‚Äì25 billion. In 2004, the Ukrainian Centre for Economic and Political Studies estimated its value at $12‚Äì13 billion. Major pipelines The gas transmission system of Ukraine could be divided into three transit corridors which are the western transit corridor, the southern transit corridor, and the north‚Äìsouth internal corridor for Russian domestic gas transportation. =Western corridor= Main pipelines of the western corridor, also known as the Bratstvo or Brotherhood pipeline system, are the Soyuz pipeline (Orenburg‚ÄìWestern border pipeline), the Progress pipeline (Yamburg‚ÄìWestern border pipeline) and the Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhhorod pipeline. In addition, it consist of the Yelets‚ÄìKursk‚ÄìDykanka pipeline, the Kursk‚ÄìKyiv pipeline, the Kyiv‚ÄìWestern border pipeline, the Komarno‚ÄìDrozdovychi pipeline, the Ivatsevichy‚ÄìDolyna pipeline, the Torzhok‚ÄìSmolensk‚ÄìMazyr‚ÄìDolyna pipeline, the Uzhhorod‚ÄìBerehove pipeline, the Dolyna‚ÄìUzhhorod pipeline, and the Khust‚ÄìSatu Mare pipeline. The Soyuz pipeline, originating from the Orenburg gas field, enters to Ukraine east of Novopskov through the Sokhranovka gas metering station in Russia. Up to Novopskov, it runs parallel to the Orenburg‚ÄìNovopskov pipeline. From there, the Soyuz pipeline runs westward until near Bar it joins the corridor of the Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhhorod and Progress pipelines. It leaves Ukraine through the Uzhhorod gas metering and pumping station. Length of the Ukrainian section of the Soyuz pipeline is and it has capacity of per year. The Progress pipeline, originating from the Yamburg gas field, runs mostly parallel to the Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhhorod pipeline. It enters to Ukraine north of Sumy through the Sudzha gas metering station in Russia and leaves through the Uzhhorod gas metering and pumping station. The Ukrainian section has length of and it has capacity of per year. The Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhhorod pipeline, originating from the Urengoy gas field, enters to Ukraine at the Sudzha gas metering station like Progress, the Kursk‚ÄìKyiv and the Yelets‚ÄìKursk‚ÄìDykanka pipelines. In Ukraine, it takes gas through to the Uzhhorod gas metering and pumping station on the Ukrainian border with Slovakia. Length of the Ukrainian section is and it has capacity of per year. The Yelets‚ÄìKursk‚ÄìDykanka and the Kursk‚ÄìKyiv pipeline enter to Ukraine through the Sudzha gas metering station. The Torzhok‚ÄìSmolensk‚ÄìMazyr‚ÄìDolyna pipeline enters Ukraine through the Mazyr gas metering station and the Ivatsevichy‚ÄìDolyna pipeline enters through the Kobryn gas metering station, both in Belarus. The Komarno‚ÄìDrozdovychi pipeline enters to Poland through the Drozdovychi metering station, the Uzhhorod‚ÄìBerehove pipeline enters to Hungary through the Berehove metering station, and the Khust‚ÄìSatu Mare pipeline enters to Romania through the Tekove metering station. =Southern corridor= Main pipelines of the southern transit corridor are the Yelets‚ÄìKremenchuk‚ÄìKryvyi Rih pipeline, the Shebelinka‚ÄìDnipropetrovsk‚ÄìKryvyi Rih‚ÄìRozdilna‚ÄìIzmail pipeline, the Kremenchuk‚ÄìAnanyiv‚ÄìBohorodchany pipeline, the Ananyiv‚ÄìTiraspol‚ÄìIzmail pipeline, and the Rozdilna‚ÄìIzmail pipeline. The gas import pipelines are the Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìShebelinka pipeline, the Urengoy‚ÄìNovopskov pipeline, the Petrovsk‚ÄìNovopskov pipeline, and the Orenburg‚ÄìNovopskov pipeline. The Yelets‚ÄìKremenchuk‚ÄìKryvyi Rih pipeline enters into Ukraine through the Sudzha gas metering station. Length of the Ukrainian section of this pipeline is and it has capacity of per year. Length of the Kremenchuk‚ÄìAnanyiv‚ÄìChernivtsi‚ÄìBohorodchany pipeline is and it has capacity of per year. It enters to Moldova through the Hrebenyky gas metering station and the reverse flow enters through the Oleksiyivka gas metering station. The Ananyiv‚ÄìTiraspol‚ÄìIzmail pipeline enters Moldova through the Hrebenyky gas metering station, and the Shebelinka‚ÄìDnipropetrovsk‚ÄìKryvyi Rih‚ÄìIzmail and the Rozdilna‚ÄìIzmail pipelines enter through the Ryasnopil (Rozdilna) gas metering station. After re-entering to Ukraine all three pipelines exit to Romania through the Orlivka gas metering and pumping station. Length of the Ananyiv‚ÄìTiraspol‚ÄìIzmail pipeline is and it has capacity of per year. The Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìShebelinka pipeline enters to Ukraine through the Valuyki gas metering station, the Orenburg‚ÄìNovopskov pipelines enters through the Sokhranovka gas metering station, and the Urengoy‚ÄìNovopskov and the Petrovsk‚ÄìNovopskov enter through the Pisarevka gas metering station, all in Russia. Crimea is connected to the main gas transportations system (Shebelinka‚ÄìDnipropetrovsk‚ÄìKryvyi Rih‚ÄìRozdilna‚ÄìIzmail pipeline) through the Marivka‚ÄìKherson‚ÄìCrimea pipeline. In Krasnoperekopsk Raion, Crimea, one branch runs to the Hlibivske storage facility, one branch runs to Dzhankoy, Feodosia and Kerch, and one branch runs to Simferopol and Sevastopol. =North‚Äìsouth Russian domestic corridor= This corridor, crossing Luhansk Oblast in Eastern Ukraine, consist of the Southern Caucasus‚ÄìCentre pipeline system. Main pipelines of this corridor are the Krasnodar‚ÄìSerpukhov pipeline and the Stavropol‚ÄìMoscow pipeline, entering to Ukraine through the Prokhorivka gas metering station in south and the Serebryanka gas metering station in north. After Russia built the Sokhranovka‚ÄìOktyabrskaya bypass and the Petrovsk‚ÄìFrolovo‚ÄìIzobilnoye pipeline, this corridor through Ukraine is not in use. However, during the Ukrainian crisis Russia used this corridor to supply Donbas regions not controlled by the Ukrainian Government through the Prokhorivka and Platovo gas metering stations. Underground gas storages Ukraine has 12 gas storage operated by Ukrtransgas. Five of these are located in Western Ukraine, two in Central Ukraine and five in Eastern Ukraine. In addition one gas storage, the Hlibivske storage facility, operated by Chornomornaftogaz, is located in Crimea and currently is not controlled by Ukraine authorities. The largest storage is Bilche‚ÄìVolytsko‚ÄìUgerske in Western Ukraine having more than half of the Ukrainian total storage capacity. Rehabilitation and modernization In 2009, Ukraine, the European Commission, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank and the World Bank signed a joint declaration on the modernisation of the Ukrainian gas transmission System. The European Union financed the feasibility study which was conducted by Mott MacDonald. According to the master plan of Ukrtransgas, the priority objects are Soyuz, Progress, Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhhorod, Yelets‚ÄìKremenchuk‚ÄìKryvyi Rih and Ananyiv‚ÄìTiraspol‚ÄìIzmail pipelines, Bilche‚ÄìVolytsko‚ÄìUgerske and Bohorodchany underground gas storages, and Uzhhorod, Berehove, Drozdovychi, Tekove and Orlivka gas metering stations. The priority investment programme requires US$3.2 billion, $342 million for storage and $2.85 billion for pipelines and compressors.

He travelled all over the world with the US Merchant Marine, lived in Mexico and Sweden and eventually settled down in the Netherlands where he \\"was part of the considerable contingency of expatriate African American artists\\". Settling in Holland in 1961, he established himself as one of The Netherlands' premier artists.\\"Sam Middleton Bio\\", Sam Middleton Blog, July 6, 2011.\\"Sam Middleton - Afro-American Artist in the Low Countries\\". Oogland Filmproducties. Vimeo. His work is part of the Whitney Museum permanent collection, which included him in its 1962 exhibition 40 Artists Under 40 and was included in the 2015 inaugural exhibition for the museum's new building on the High Line. Middleton was born in New York City and grew up in Harlem, NY. Known for his personal style, Middleton liked to use abstract expressionism in his work, basing his color, lines, and compositions around sound and harmony. Middleton specialized in working with collage.  Early Life  As a young boy growing up in Harlem, Middleton often visited the nearby Savoy Ballroom and music ‚Äì jazz and classical ‚Äì became important inspirations for his artistic endeavors. Working at the Savoy, Middleton designed costumes, and painted record and book covers. Middleton‚Äôs early painting was heavily influenced by the musicians of the Harlem renaissance, such as Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, and Billie Holiday. When he was 17, Middleton left Harlem to work on a boat with the Merchant Marines, to get away from Harlem and have time to paint. While abroad, Middleton visited art galleries and museums for inspiration.  Career  Middleton struggled as an artist in the United States, due to his race and status, but continued to refine his technique, studying with other Black creatives like Beauford Delaney. In 1956, Middleton won a scholarship to the Institute Allende in San Miguel Allende, Mexico, and studied in Mexico for the next several years. In 1959, after significantly advancing his technical skill and having the opportunity to showcase his art, Middleton travelled to Europe to paint, living in Spain, Sweden, France, and Denmark before settling in the Netherlands in 1961. After moving to the Netherlands, Middleton returned to Harlem periodically, but never again held residence in America, despite calls from fellow African Americans to return. Middleton found greater creative freedom in Holland while holding onto his jazz influences. = Emigration = Middleton moved to the Netherlands as part of a wave of African American artists, along with Deborah Simon, Sherard Van Dyke and Lorina Harris. He remained in Europe to escape racism and lack of opportunity for African Americans in the United States, but was uninvolved with the civil rights movement. Because of his expatriate status, and the fact that his artwork wasn‚Äôt focused on his race, Middleton‚Äôs paintings are largely absent from African American art collections in the United States. He did, however, become a figure in the Dutch art community, and opened his doors to other African American artists who came to the Netherlands, helping them gain traction in Europe. Middleton was able to display exhibitions of his artwork in a prominent Dutch art gallery, an opportunity that was limited to very few Black artists in America. He lived in Amsterdam for many years but, fascinated by the landscape, settled in Oterleek in North Holland in 1973. Music, (both classical and jazz) and the landscape of North Holland, created the climate of his abstract expressionist work. Middleton‚Äôs style evolved to reflect newfound inspirations, like the expansive tulip fields of the country. His paintings became fuller and softer, while maintaining their distinct jazz connections. Middleton taught at Atelier '63 in Haarlem and the Royal Academy of Art in ‚Äòs Hertogenbosch, jobs that provided enough income to fuel his artistic career. He married twice, had three sons, one daughter and seven grandchildren.

Flowering occurs from March or May to June or October and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped or barrel-shaped capsule with shallow ribs along the sides and the valves enclosed below the level of the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus ligulata was first formally described in 1974 by the botanist Ian Brooker from a specimen collected by Keith M. Allan near a beach in the Cape Le Grand National Park. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (ligulata) is a Latin word meaning \\"strap-shaped\\". In 2002, Dean Nicolle described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus ligulata Brooker subsp. ligulata; * Eucalyptus ligulata subsp. stirlingica Nicolle has shorter pedicels and narrower flower buds with an operculum that is much longer than the floral cup of the autonym.

Davis is best known for his carvings of historical figures such as a set of mahogany busts of all the presidents (through George H. W. Bush) and similar portrait heads of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Kennedys and other leaders from the civil rights era. Early life Ulysses Davis was born in the railroad town of Fitzgerald, Georgia, to Mary and Malachi Davis. His father was a railway fireman, while his mother was a homemaker. The fourth of five children, Davis left school after the fourth grade to work as a railroad blacksmith‚Äôs assistant to help support his family. This aspiring wood carver started whittling the family‚Äôs firewood with a pocket knife as a child. In 1942, Davis moved his family to Savannah, where he would live for 48 years, raising six sons and three daughters with his wife, Elizabeth. When he was laid off by the railroad in the 1950s, he opened the Ulysses Barber Shop in an outbuilding near his home at Bull and 45th Street. He lined the shelves of his barbershop with his wood carvings, creating a makeshift art gallery, and enjoyed discussing art with his customers. He typically created his sculptures, busts, canes and portraits freehand, without drawings, using a hatchet or band saw to start a piece and then finishing it with a chisel or knife. He designed many of his own tools, applying the metalworking skills he learned as a young man working as a railroad blacksmith. He even used barber scissors, on occasion, to get just the right texture on his sculptures, which he sometimes adorned with shoe polish, rhinestones and beads. When reflecting on his own work, the artist said: \\"These things are very dear to me. They‚Äôre a part of me. They‚Äôre my treasure. If I sold these, I‚Äôd be really poor.\\"Allison Hersh, \\"Beach Institute celebrates creative legacy of Ulysses Davis\\", Savannah Morning News, October 8, 2011. Artistic methods and materials used Davis worked with many kinds of wood, including mahogany, cedar and poplar, sometimes obtained from friends who worked as longshoremen on the Savannah docks. He typically worked without the aid of preliminary drawings, using hatchets and band saws to rough out the form before picking up a chisel or knife. He fashioned some of his tools himself, using metalworking skills he learned during a stint as a railroad blacksmith.Karen Rosenberg, \\"A Barber‚Äôs Carved Legacy, Finished With Rhinestones and Shoe Polish\\", The New York Times, April 23, 2009. Some of his carvings are painted, stained or rubbed with black shoe polish and adorned with rhinestones and pearl beads. He also used metal punches and stamps, of his own design, to create lizard-like surface textures, as in the pair of serpentine sculptures \\"Beast With Wings\\" and \\"Created Beast With Many Heads.\\" Davis created over three hundred pieces of art in his lifetime including carved wooden figured, furniture pieces, and reliefs. He used unique sculpting and building materials such as shipyard lumber, pieces donated by his friends, or wood he bought at lumberyards. Davis almost never made preliminary drawings or models but reduced the mass with a hatchet or a bandsaw before refining the form with a chisel and knives. To add textural detail, he sometimes used tools of this barbering trade, such as the blade of his hair clippers.\\"The Treasure of Ulysses Davis: April 21‚ÄìSeptember 6, 2009\\", American Folk Art Museum. Inspiration and themes Although Davis has been best known for his carvings of historical figures, he carved portraits of historical and biblical figures, realistic animals, and fanciful portraits of African tribal leaders as well as dragon-like beasts. As far as Davis's approach to African American art goes, he synthesized motifs from different parts of the continent. His \\"Makonde\\", a version of the \\"Tree of Life\\" found in sculpture from Tanzania and Mozambique, includes a Janus-like divinity out of Yoruba cosmology. He also relied on popular representations of Africans, basing one series of sculptures on illustrations of warrior kings from a 1970s Anheuser-Busch promotional calendar. Not only looking to Africa, he created works that featured a potbellied Buddha and as well as an armless figure with features resembling those on Himalayan masks called \\"Red Lips.\\" His most intricate works are the decorative objects he referred to as \\"twinklets\\": tiered boxes that look like wedding cakes, adorned with beads and crystals. He also made canes, tables and other functional pieces. ‚ÄúThe Garden of Eden,‚Äù his last and largest work, depicts Adam and Eve nestled between the legs of a table. A grinning serpent rises from the tabletop.

Wickham was born in Thompson, Connecticut on April 4, 1797, the eldest son of Daniel H. and Mary (Dresser) Wickham, who in 1799 removed to New York City. He graduated from Yale College in 1815. For the last five years of his life, he was the last survivor of the class of 1815, and for three years was the oldest living graduate of Yale. For the first year after leaving College he served as amanuensis to Yale President Timothy Dwight, and during the following year was Rector of the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven. From 1818 to 1820 he held a tutorship in Yale College, at the same time pursuing theological studies under Professors Fitch and Goodrich. He began his ministerial labors in 1821 as a missionary on Long Island, and then spent some time in central New York in the service of the Presbyterian Education Society. Having been invited to the charge of a Congregational Church in Oxford, Chenango County, he began his labors there in January, 1823, and on July 31, at the dedication of a new house of worship, he was ordained to the ministry. He removed in the spring of 1825 to Westchester County, New York, where he remained for a somewhat longer period in charge of the united Presbyterian churches of New Rochelle and West Farms. In 1828 he became one of the proprietors of the Washington Institute, a prominent boarding-school for boys in New York City, where he remained (ultimately in sole charge) until 1834, in November of which year he was installed pastor of the recently organized Presbyterian Church at Matteawan in the town of Fishkill, N. Y. At the end of two years, being solicited to renew his service in connection with the Education Society, he spent a laborious year among the churches of Northern and Western New York. He removed in December, 1837, to Manchester, Vt., to take charge of the Burr Seminary, with which he remained connected for twenty- five years, except for three years (1853-56), in the first of which he was Treasurer of Middlebury College and Acting Professor of Latin and Greek, while for the two following years he was connected with the Collegiate Institute in Poughkeepsie, N. Y. In 1856 he returned after great urgency to the charge of Burr Seminary, but resigned his position in 1862, though continuing to serve the institution as President of its Board of Trustees. He lived in retirement in Manchester until his death, retaining remarkable physical and mental vigor to the last. He was chosen a member of the Board of Trustees of Middlebury College in 1840, and continued in that position throughout his life. That corporation conferred upon him the degree of D.D. in 1861. Dr. Wickham was married, on May 26, 1823, to Julia A., only daughter of Jonathan E. Porter, of New Haven and a niece of President Dwight. She died on December 23, 1830. He was again married, on December 28, 1831, to Amy, daughter of Col. Moses Porter, of Hadley, Mass., and a cousin of his first wife, who died October 29, 1832. He was married for the third time, on October 12, 1834, to Elizabeth C., eldest daughter of the Rev. Samuel Merwin, who survived him. Of his two children, a daughter by his first wife died in infancy, and a daughter by his second wife survived him. He died of old age in Manchester May 12, 1891, in his 95th year.

Massacres  Serbs were maltreated and accused of being Serbian agents. Panic ensued, and Serbs, primarily from the border areas fled to Serbia. Albanians who participated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897) used weapons not turned in to the authorities against the Serbs in Old Serbia. In May 1901, Albanians set Sjenica, Novi Pazar and Pristina on fire. The Albanians went on a rampage massacring Serbs in Pristina (How many?). Ibarski Kola≈°in (now known as North Kosovo), a forested region made up of 40 villages, largely inhabited by Serbs, where Serbian teachers and priests were active, had long irritated the Albanians and Ottoman government; Serbs were continuously maltreated in the region. The Serbian government observed the developments in Kola≈°in, and did not remain idle. The situation became serious, with Serbs being smuggled arms by Serbia to defend themselves. Albanian atrocities had taken such wide proportions that the government of Vladan ƒêorƒëeviƒá was forced to begin a wide diplomatical action for the protection Serbs in Old Serbia; when these efforts did not take fruit, and the Albanians were empowered and intensified atrocities against the Serbs, the unprotected Kosovo Serbs began to demand arms to protect themselves. The Ottoman government was made aware of the smuggling, that most arms ended up in Kola≈°in, by Isa Boletini in early July, Boletini having led the investigation. In the summer of 1901, after the Ottoman investigation, Albanians massacred Serbs in the Kola≈°in area. Boletini was present while the organised atrocities on Kola≈°in were carried out, including massacres, rape, blackmail, looting and eviction of local ethnic Serbs. The atrocities prompted the Russian government to intervene at the Porte. Violence in Kola≈°in stopped, however, Albanian atrocities in other regions continued.  Reactions  = Russia = Initially, the Porte did not suppress the Albanian movement nor protect the Serbs. Russia demanded that the Albanians and Turkish gendarmeries be punished and the Serbs be allowed to keep the arms for protection. The Porte answered by mass arrests and criminalizing the Albanian language. The governor (vali) was dismissed, and several other anti-Serb officials, and Albanian chieftains who had been especially cruel, were removed from their posts. = Austria- Hungary = Austria-Hungary, supported the Albanians, and tried to downplay the massacre. The events were instrumental in the \\"Kola≈°in affair\\" (), a diplomatic conflict between Austria-Hungary, which supported the Albanians, and Serbia, which was supported by Russia.

Although the American Civil War had ended in 1865, African Americans still faced many difficulties at the turn of the century, so many of them left the South and moved North in search for better opportunities; Ellison was one of them.  Early life  Born in Eatonton, Georgia, according to census and draft records Ellison was a farm hand. He was 18 years old when the United States decided to enter World War I in Europe in 1917 and immigration from Europe to the United States virtually stopped. Because of that, between 1916 and 1970 seven million African Americans left the South for the North, in what became known as the Great Migration, with about half a million of them going to Chicago looking for jobs and new opportunities. Ellison boarded the train to Chicago in the early 1920s in search of an education and a job. He attended classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and at Hull House. He was employed on the Illinois Art Project of the WPA and was a founding member of the South Side Community Art Center, along with a number of younger black artists, including Margaret Burroughs, Eldzier Cortor, Gordon Parks, Charles Sebree, and Charles White. He also became involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  Art and work  Ellison is best known for intimately-scaled works that reveal the private lives and shared experiences of African Americans who moved to northern cities from the rural South between World War I and II. His most famous painting, Train Station, held in the Art Institute of Chicago, depicts white people on one side of a station platform, identified as being in Macon, Georgia, who are heading south for luxury holidays, with African Americans carrying their bags, and African Americans on the other side of the platform, carrying their own luggage, boarding a train for the North and a new start. In an untitled painting created in 1937, Ellison depicts a well-made-up African American woman lying back in a beautician's chair with her eyes closed and her temples being massaged. Only the beautician's hands are seen, with her fingernails featuring a \\"French manicure\\" ‚Äì red centers with white moons and tips ‚Äì a style that has obviously captivated the artist. The woman being massaged seems millions of miles away from whatever might have been troubling her that day.

The film stars newcomer Brandon Gaines, Chinese actress Yu Feihong, and martial artists Keith Vitali, Chuck Jeffreys, Cliff Lenderman, and Brian Ruth amongst others. The film was the first American production by Hong Kong-based Seasonal Film Corporation since their 1991 film American Shaolin. Plot Jack Cody has always been a fan of the Superfights, a televised event that meshes the likes of martial arts and professional wrestling. During an event, Jack meets one of his idols, No Mercy Budokai, who while cheering is nearly given a cheap chair shot by the heel known as The Enforcer. Jack blocks the chair shot and Budokai thanks him before competing in the ring. Budokai wins the fight against the Enforcer to the crowd's delight. Jack is such a rabid fan that he spends his days during work practicing his martial arts in a local warehouse. While ridiculed by his supervisor, Jack still gets his job done. One night, en route home, he sees a young woman, Sally Wong, about to be robbed at an ATM. Jack is able to fend off the robbers and Sally invites him to her house to meet her grandfather. The grandfather is not grateful for Jack's heroism and even goes as far as thinking he set the robbery up to impress Sally. The grandfather is revealed to be quite a martial artist himself and tests Jack out only to humiliate him. Jack leaves and Sally is embarrassed by what had transpired. When Jack returns home, he finds news crews all over his house as surveillance video reveals his heroic actions. The newscast grabs the attention of Robert Sawyer, the owner of the Superfights, who wants to make Jack an offer. Despite his mother's reservations, Jack accepts the offer to join the Superfights. He is nicknamed \\"The All-American Hero\\" and befriends the likes of fellow Superfighters Budokai, Night Stalker, and Dark Cloud. However, before he can become a full Superfighter, Jack must undergo training with Angel, one of the top Superfighters. During training, Angel flirts with Jack and has him take some pills, which Angel says are vitamins. Jack eventually proves himself ready for his first fight, in which he faces the Enforcer. During their match, the Enforcer puts Jack in a headlock and Sally, who is in the audience, begins a \\"Jack Cody\\" chant, which motivates Jack to fight and eventually win his debut match. Soon, Jack begins to win more and more matches, but after a match with The Mercenary, he begins to suspect that maybe the veterans are going soft on him because he's a rookie. However, Angel confides in Jack that he is winning. During a jog one morning, Jack sees a mysterious man dressed like a ninja. The man warns him that he is not winning the matches as he thinks he is and that the Superfights are not just about the sport. The ninja does an armbar and wristlock to Jack and tells him that the Superfights are also about some criminal activities. He also warns Jack not to take the pills as they are not vitamins. It is revealed that the Superfighters are involved in taking over criminal activity all over city. This is seen when Budokai, Night Stalker, and Dark Cloud beat up a local gang who refuses to give half of their money to them. Meanwhile, Jack runs into Sally's grandfather at the park and in his own way, the grandfather apologizes to Jack for his actions. He even tells Jack he is teaching Sally martial arts and to meet him at a local gym the next day. It is there where Jack and Sally begin to train in the art of Tai Chi. Grandfather teaches Jack this style to complement his hard style martial arts. As Jack continues to train with Grandfather, he begins to win his matches using his combined style. When Grandfather finds the \\"vitamins\\", he asks to hold on to them to have them analyzed. It is revealed that the \\"vitamins\\" are actually a combination of steroids and mind control drugs. Robert Sawyer is revealed to be the big crime boss when he gets himself in on a drug deal that eventually goes sour. When it is revealed that \\"baby powder\\" replaced actual cocaine, he sends in his greatest fighter \\"The Beast\\" to kill the dealer. When Sawyer is confronted by the dealer's brother in his office the next morning, Sawyer reveals himself as a master martial artist who uses two rings with hooks on the end and a kick to the throat to kill his adversaries. When Jack learns he must throw a match when he faces Dark Cloud as part of the deal with Superfights, Jack refuses to give up and wins the fight. However, after being reamed out by Sawyer for disobeying him, he offers Jack a second chance. This is where Jack learns that the Superfights are more than the sport as he is forced to join Budokai, Night Stalker, and Dark Cloud to get protection from a local Chinese restaurant that he's eaten at. Returning home from the job, the ninja from earlier returns and fights Jack. However, Jack gets the upper hand and unmasks the ninja. The ninja is Budokai, who has been cooperating with the police incognito to take down Sawyer. Budokai also reveals that the Beast is Mike Rocco, Jack's childhood hero who had been forced into becoming Sawyer's top enforcer. When Jack gets a call from Sawyer to go to a local nightclub, Jack heads there and is confronted by Angel, who by this time, does not approve of Sawyer's extracurricular activities. At the nightclub, it is revealed Sawyer has set up a fight to the death between the Beast and Budokai, whose cover had been blown. The Beast nearly kills Budokai when Jack intervenes and is able to show the Beast the pendant that was given to him as a child when the Beast was Mike Rocco. The Beast is shocked but remembers. When Sawyer orders the Beast to kill Jack, the Beast goes after Sawyer instead, only for Sawyer to retaliate and kill the Beast with a stomp to the neck. That night, Budokai is nearly dead when Grandfather comes up with the idea for he and Jack to focus their \\"chi\\" on Budokai to heal him. Successfully, they help Budokai when Jack gets a call from Sawyer. Sawyer has kidnapped Sally and Jack's mother and challenges Jack to a final fight. Jack goes to the training grounds of the Superfights, where he takes on Sawyer in a cage match. However, Jack is able to escape and finds himself facing off against Dark Cloud and Night Stalker as well. When Sawyer attempts to get the upper hand, Sawyer and Jack are thrown through boxes. As Dark Cloud and Night Stalker look to see what happened, Jack gets up and is able to take out both Night Stalker and Dark Cloud. When Angel, who is also there, confronts Jack, she wises up and helps him free Sally and his mother. As the trio are about to leave, Sawyer returns and does a triple jump kick, knocking Sally and Mrs. Cody out. As Sawyer goes for his throat kick to Jack, Angel deflects and fights Sawyer, only to get the death kick herself. Jack finally arises and goes one-on-one with Sawyer. Sawyer proves to be too much for Jack with his intense kicking skills and hook rings. However, when Sally turns off the lights and yells for Jack to concentrate, Jack realizes he must use Tai Chi. As Sawyer goes back on the attack, Jack begins to use Tai Chi and deflects and eventually knocks down Sawyer. Jack soon gets the upper hands and ends it with a drop kick to Sawyer, sending him to the cage, where he is impaled on a wooden block with barbed wire. Angel gives her last words to Jack as she dies. The police arrive as does Grandfather and a somewhat recuperated Budokai. Grandfather tells Jack that he is truly a hero.

Early life and education  Kanhaiya Kumar in a TIMES OF INDIA (media) event (2016) Kanhaiya Kumar was born in January 1987, and brought up in the village of Bihat (near Barauni) in Begusarai district, Bihar. His family belongs to Bihar's Bhumihar community. The village is part of the Teghra (Vidhan Sabha constituency), known to be a stronghold of the CPI. Kumar's father is Jaishankar Singh. His mother, Meena Devi, is an Anganwadi worker. He has an elder brother, Manikant, who works as a supervisor with a company in Assam. His family members have traditionally been supporters of the CPI. Kanhaiya Kumar studied till Class VI at Madhya Vidyalaya, Masnadpur, before joining R. K. C. High School in Barauni. During his school days, Kumar took part in several plays and activities organized by IPTA (Indian People's Theatre Association), a left-leaning cultural group going back to the days of India's freedom struggle. He cleared his Class X board exams in 2002 with a first division. After school, Kumar joined the Ram Ratan Singh College at Mokama, taking up science in Class XI-XII. He then graduated with a degree in geography from the College of Commerce, Arts and Science, Patna in 2007, earning a \\"first-class\\". Political career While at the Patna College of Commerce, Kumar began getting involved in student politics. He joined the AISF, and a year later was selected as a delegate at its conference in Patna. After completing his post graduation with an MA in sociology from Nalanda Open University in Patna, again securing a first class, he moved to Delhi and after ranking first in the entrance exam in 2011, joined Jawaharlal Nehru University where he pursued a PhD in African studies at the School of International Studies. He completed his PhD in February 2019, titled The Process of Decolonisation and Social Transformation in South Africa, 1994-2015. In September 2015, Kumar became president of the JNU students' union, representing the AISF. In March 2016, Kumar stated in an interview, \\"the first inspiration who made me want to join politics was Bhagat Singh. Then the path continued into Ambedkar, Gandhi and Marx, and also to Birsa Munda and Jyotirao Phule....\\" Kumar's autobiography, Bihar to Tihar: My Political Journey was published in October 2016. The book his life from his childhood days to his political involvement in Delhi. On 29 April 2018, he was elected to the party national council of the Communist Party of India (CPI). Later in 2019, he was inducted into CPI national executive council. =2019 Lok Sabha elections= Kumar contested from Begusarai on Communist Party of India's ticket for the 2019 Indian general election. He lost the election, polling a total of votes and 22.03% of vote share. He secured a distant second position after losing to Giriraj Singh of Bharatiya Janata Party by votes. About his defeat, he told Aaj Tak in an interview, \\"I didn't have anything directly to lose in these elections. I got support from the people for fighting against a big, rich and influential machinery and this is a message from democracy that a son of an Anganwadi worker can contest elections.\\" Reception =JNU sedition row= In February 2016, Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested by the Delhi police over the charges of sedition in an event at the JNU campus. It was organised by JNU students to commemorate the second anniversary of the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru. Kumar denied shouting any slogans against integrity of the country. Kumar's arrest drew sharp reactions from opposition parties, teachers, students and academics. Students at JNU went on strike to protest his arrest. Kumar was assaulted on multiple occasions when brought to the Patiala House court for hearings regarding the matter. A Supreme Court- appointed panel later confirmed that the policemen present at the Court were responsible for the security lapses. On 2 March 2016, Kumar was granted interim bail for 6 months by the Delhi High Court, conditional on an undertaking that he would not \\"participate in any anti-national activity.\\" Justice Pratibha Rani noted that there were no recordings of Kumar participating in anti-national slogans. A separate magisterial investigation appointed by the Delhi Government concluded that it did not find any evidence of Kumar participating in anti-national slogans. Following his release from jail, Kumar faced death threats. A leader of the BJP's youth wing offered 5 lakh as a reward to anyone who cut off Kumar's tongue. Posters were put up in New Delhi offering 11 lakh as a reward to anyone who killed Kumar. = Speech on campus = On 3 March 2016, Kanhaiya Kumar gave a speech to a packed auditorium in the JNU campus, during which he said he was seeking, not freedom from India, but freedom within India. He appealed to his fellow students to free the nation from the clutches of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which, he stated, was trying to divide the nation. Referring to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, he called them his \\"opposition\\", not his enemy. He urged his supporters to keep raising the slogans of Azadi (freedom). The speech won accolades from the leaders of non-BJP parties as well as independent commentators. Shashi Tharoor commented that it turned Kumar into a \\"nationwide political star,\\" and congratulated BJP for creating this phenomenon. Some people also expressed concern that his speech did not address \\"the graveness of alleged anti-national slogans\\" shouted at JNU and what he did to stop them.

Russia's Memorial Human Rights Center considers Belousov a political prisoner; Amnesty International has declared him a prisoner of conscience and has described his trial in 2013-14 as a farce. Human Rights Watch calls his conviction a ‚Äúmiscarriage of justice.‚Äù His continued imprisonment has been condemned by both the U.S. State Department and by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the U.S. House of Representatives. Early life and education Belousov was born on July 30, 1991. As of May 2012, he was a fourth-year student in the Faculty of Political Science at Moscow State University and a member of the Russian Citizens Union, a national democratic movement. A December 2012 profile of Belousov described him as having lived ‚Äúa life full of promise‚Äù until his arrest. Bolotnaya Square protest A mass protest against Vladimir Putin took place on May 6, 2012, in Bolotnaya Square in Moscow. The participants in the demonstration were described in the New York Times as a representation of middle-class Russians opposed to Putin's presidency. At the time of the protest, both Belousov and his wife were studying at Moscow State University. Both of them attended the protest on Bolotnaya Square. Belousov's wife, Tamara Belousova, later said that her husband had attended the protest in part because of his research into political organization methods. Belousov himself later stated he attended Bolotnaya Square for to collect data for his university thesis. According to his wife, Belousov had gradually become more active in promoting civic discussion. According to authorities, 29 police officers and 55 protesters reported injuries, mostly minor, sustained in the violence that erupted during the Bolotnaya Square protest. Russian investigators claimed that the violence had been part of an orchestrated plan to destabilize the government. Belousov was among those arrested during the protests, and released the same day. He denied having taken part in clashes during the demonstration. =Second arrest and charges= On June 9, 2012, Belousov was taken into custody again, this time by authorities appearing at his apartment where he lived with his wife, child, and mother-in-law. Belousov was charged under paragraph 2 of Article 212 (‚ÄúParticipation in Mass Riots‚Äù) and paragraph 1 of Article 318 (‚ÄúUse of Violence Not Endangering Life or Health against a Representative of the Authorities) of the Russian Federation‚Äôs Criminal Code. =Incarceration= Belousov was imprisoned pending trial by the Moscow Zamoskvoretsky Court. Between his arrest and December 2012, he was allowed to see his wife only twice, in the visitors‚Äô room of the detention center. One observer of his pre-trial incarceration criticized the lengths the government took to imprison Belousov when he had a proven record of compliance. Gazeta reported on July 4, 2012, that the Basmanny court had extended the incarceration of Belousov and three other protesters, Maxim Lusyanin, Andrei Barabanov, and Fedor Backhov. =Support for Belousov= In June 2012, Russia's human-rights ombudsman stated the mass- rioting charges brought against Belousov and others were disproportionate. In December 2013, ‚Äúan international panel of experts on freedom of assembly published a report that found that although there were individual violent episodes‚Äù that had taken place in Bolotnaya Square, they did not constitute a 'mass riot'. This panel, too, described the criminal charges brought against Belousov and others as unwarranted and concluded that the May 6 violence was a result of the government's response. The conclusion of Human Rights Watch (HRW) was virtually the same, with HRW official Tanya Lokshina saying: ‚ÄúThe facts on the ground simply did not justify mass rioting charges against the protesters, let alone conviction.‚Äù During Belousov's imprisonment, HRW called on Russia to release the demonstrators from custody and stated that authorities‚Äô actions violated the European Convention of Human Rights, of which Russia is a signatory. Amnesty International designated Belousov a prisoner of conscience. IFEX stated that there was ‚Äúno video evidence‚Äù linking Belousov to any act of violence. The Committee of Concerned Scientists wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin in support of Belousov, and Russia's Memorial Human Rights Center recognized Belousov as a political prisoner. Trial The trial against Belousov and his fellow defendants began on June 6, 2013. The ages of Belousov and his fellow defendants in the case, all males, ranged from 19 to 51, according to the New York Times, though most were in their 20s. They were of a myriad of backgrounds, some being students, and journalists. According to officials, Belousov had thrown ‚Äúrocks and pieces of asphalt‚Äù and had broken through a cordon and attacked police officers. Video evidence, supported by the testimony of witnesses, indicated that Belousov had only thrown a piece of fruit. In one four-second video, according to Forbes Magazine, he was seen ‚Äúbending down to pick up an object, which he then aimlessly tossed‚Ä¶in the direction of riot police. There are no videos or still images of the object striking anyone‚Ä¶.Videos taken from another angle (and posted on the web) clearly show Belousov tossing the remains of the crushed tangerine or lemon he had bent down to retrieve.‚Äù While the defense said that the item in question was a lemon, and that the policeman who claimed to have been harmed by the projectile had departed from the scene before it was thrown, prosecutors argued that the object in question had been a billiard ball. Belousov was represented by attorney Dmitry V. Agranovsky, who also represented another defendant in the same trial, Vladimir Akimenkov. On June 9, 2013, the New York Times cited Agranovsky's view that ‚Äúthe lengthy pretrial detention of most of the defendants was proof of the political nature of the charges,‚Äù and quoted him as stating that it was unusual the government detained the suspects were held for a year without bail, despite no previous arrest record for any of them. Agranovsky further told the Times that the charges against Belousov were based entirely on one officer's testimony who claimed to be struck in the chest by a \\"yellow object\\". Agranovsky expressed doubt that the officer had been seriously hurt, noting ‚Äú[a] riot police officer‚Äôs chest is protected by a serious guard, some sort of Kevlar vest, which can withstand at the very least knives, and maybe things stronger.‚Äù Agranovsky also expressed pessimism about the trial's likely outcome, stating the best likely outcome was a reduced sentence. The Times also reported in its June 9 article that the case against Belousov and the other Bolotnaya Square protesters, as well as other cases against opposition leaders, had managed to suppress the anti-Putin protest movement through fear. Critics claimed that the government's clamp down on ordinary protestors, rather than opposition leaders, indicated their intent to intimidate. The case against Belousov and other protesters was set apart from other trials against opposition members, according to the Times, by the fact ‚Äúthat not one of the defendants was a high-profile opposition leader when arrested.‚Äù In January 2014, Moscow's Zamoskvoretsky court rejected amnesty for both Belousov and Alexandra Dukhanina, another defendant in the Bolotnaya Square case. The prosecutor in the trial demanded a 5-year prison sentence for Belousov. In his closing statement, Belousov state: ‚ÄúI do not plead guilty because I was not involved in any wrongdoing.‚Äù =Verdict and sentencing= On February 21, 2014, Belousov and seven other defendants were found guilty of ‚Äúapplication of force against representatives of authority.‚Äù The sentencing was characterized by a writer for Forbes as having been ‚Äúconveniently delayed‚Ä¶until after the‚Ä¶closing ceremony‚Äù of the Sochi Olympics. On the day the verdict was handed down, Amnesty International issued a statement describing the trial of Belousov and his seven co-defendants as ‚Äúclearly a show trial.‚Äù John Dalhuisen of Amnesty International said, ‚ÄúWhat happened on Bolotnaya Square on May 6, 2012 was not the quelling of a riot, but the crushing of a protest. The Bolotnaya trial has not exposed orchestrated violence, but rather a criminal justice system that is entirely malleable to the dictates of its political masters.\\" Amnesty International called for the immediate release of the Bolotnaya protestors whom it described as prisoners of conscience. Human Rights Watch described the guilty verdicts against Belousov and the other seven defendants as ‚Äúa miscarriage of justice.‚Äù On February 24, 2014, Belousov was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months in prison. The judge stated he had received a reduced sentence due to his having never committed a crime previously. The judge maintained, however, that defense witnesses‚Äô testimony had ‚Äúnot refuted the overflowing of the events into mass riots and have not refuted the proof of participation of the defendants in the riots.‚Äù Outside the court, protesters held a banner reading: ‚ÄúYou Can‚Äôt Jail Everybody.‚Äù As the judge read the sentences for Belousov and his fellow defendants, according to one source, \\"chants of ‚ÄòShame!‚Äô\\" entered the court. Agranovsky told a reporter that the harsh punishment meted out to his client was, in his view, ‚Äúin part a Kremlin reaction to the upheaval in neighbouring Ukraine.‚Äù At the sentencing, about 200 persons, among them two previously incarcerated members of the punk band Pussy Riot, were briefly detained by police outside the court. In a February 25, 2014, statement, the U.S. Department of State condemned the sentencing of Belousov and the other protestors. The State Department claimed that they had been unlawfully detained for over a year on politically-motivated charges, calling it \\"another example of punishment of Russians for exercising their constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech and assembly.\\" On February 27, 2014, the co- chairman of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the House of Representatives of the United States, Jim McGovern (D-MA) and Frank Wolf (R-VA), expressed ‚Äúgrave concern over the mass detentions of peaceful protesters‚Äù who had taken to the streets ‚Äúto protest the sentences handed down in the cases of eight participants of the Bolotnaya Square demonstrations,‚Äù including Belousov. The Lantos Commission described the trials as having been ‚Äúmarked by a lack of due process‚Äù and as ‚Äúwidely recognized as politically- motivated,‚Äù and urged the Russian government ‚Äúto address these recent instances of blatant injustice.‚Äù Personal life Belousov and his wife, Tamara Belousova, were married in 2010. She was 21 years old in June 2013, and at that time was also a political science student. She and her husband are the parents of a son, Andrei, who was 4 years old as of June 2015. According to his wife, Belousov is ‚Äúa scholarly man interested in political science‚Äù Describing him as ‚Äúa man of books,‚Äù she told the New York Times in June 2013 that ‚Äúthis saves him now that he is in jail‚Ä¶.I asked him how he celebrated the New Year; he answered that he finished reading five volumes of the history of the Middle Ages.‚Äù References Category:Russian activists Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Russian prisoners and detainees Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Russia ","title":"Yaroslav Belousov"},{"id":"49452640","title":"English Garden (album)"},{"id":"49452645","text":"Richard of Wallingdorf, inventor of the rectangulus The rectangulus was an astronomical instrument made by Richard of Wallingford around 1326. Dissatisfied with the limitations of existing astrolabes, Richard developed the rectangulus as an instrument for spherical trigonometry and to measure the angles between planets and other astronomical bodies. This was one of a number of instruments he created, including the Albion, a form of equatorium, and a famously complicated and expensive horologium (astronomical clock). His Tractus Rectanguli, describing the rectangulus, was an influential text in medieval astronomy and at least thirty copies were known to survive. His Quadripartitum was the first text on spherical trigonometry to be published in Western Europe. The rectangulus was a form of skeleton torquetum. This was a series of nested angular scales, so that measurements in azimuth and elevation could be made directly in polar coordinates, relative to the ecliptic. Conversion from these coordinates though was difficult, involving what was the leading mathematics of the day. The rectangulus was an analogue computing device to simplify this: instead of measuring in angular measurements it could resolve the angles to Cartesian components directly. This then simplified the further calculations. The rectangulus was constructed as a brass pillar with a number of linear scales hinged above it. Pinhole sights on the upper arm allowed it to be pointed accurately at the astronomical target. Plumb bob lines descended from the scales above and intersected with linear scales marked on the horizontal scales below. These allowed measures to be read, not as angles, but as trigonometric ratios. To celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Rectangulus in 1926 a replica was constructed. This is now in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.

The park contains various public services and attractions, including football and baseball fields, the Thomas D. Howie Memorial National Guard Armory, a large bandstand pavilion, a golf course, a basketball court, a gym, and the central duck pond equipped with food dispensers, allowing visitors to feed the ducks and fish. Throughout the park are picnic tables, grills and covered pavilions. Constitution Drive, an almost road, runs through the park and is often used as a walking and bike path. The miniature train, the Gypsy Express, began in 1958. The train operates passengers from May to October. Tickets cost one dollar. Presently, the train is maintained and operated by volunteers. Unique to the Gypsy Express is an Easy Access Car designed and built by volunteers to accommodate handicapped riders. A documentary recounts the history of the train.  History  During the mid 1800s, the area now known as Gypsy Hill Park served as the water supply for the city of Staunton via a local pumping plant that utilized the many underwater springs found in the area. In order to protect the surrounding area, Staunton purchased approximately 30 acres of land by 1876. By 1890, the city had purchased 60 more acres. A proposal was presented to the city council, which subsequently created the park. After the proposal was approved, the lands between Churchville Avenue and the Baldwin Fair Association were designated as the perimeter for the new park, thanks to the planning of Staunton resident Captain William P. Tams, along with others. It came to be known as Gypsy Hill Park due to the many gypsies that camped in the area. In order to accommodate more park features, Staunton bought the Baldwin Fairgrounds, a local park which already had a slate of activities that drew people to the site. As the park grew, so did its attractions, including a zoo. = Stonewall Brigade Band = The Stonewall Brigade Band, a community-based band, has undergone various name changes during different periods; it was also known as the 5th Regiment Band (Civil War era), Second Corps Band, and Turner's Silver Cornet Band. In the mid-1800s, founder David W. Drake convinced his professor, A. J. Turner, to move to Staunton. Over the years, the band performed throughout Staunton, including Gypsy Hill Park. They performed for President Grant when he was in Staunton and have traveled and played at prestigious venues in cities such as New York and Chicago. The Stonewall Brigade Band has remained intact and still performs today. = Segregation = In 2008, a documentary about Staunton during the Jim Crow era debuted revealing the truth behind segregation laws in the city. Staunton citizen Rita Wilson, who eventually became a member of the city council and served for 16 years, spoke out about the issue. She recalled not being allowed into the park's premises. One day out of the year, blacks were allowed entrance. Since 1988, Staunton has held an African American Heritage Festival which focuses on various aspects of African American culture including various types of live music, crafts, presentations, and displays.  Events  During summer months, the park draws large crowds with a variety of free concerts and activities. Every Monday night, the Stonewall Brigade Band performs at eight p.m. Tuesday night is \\"Praise in the Park,\\" where musicians perform faith based music starting at seven p.m. Wednesday nights are reserved for bluegrass music, and Thursday nights are reserved for jazz performances, which are both held at seven p.m. On every other Friday night, a family-friendly movie is projected onto the pavilion at dark. The Staunton Parks and Recreation departments funds and supports all of the activities that take place throughout the course of the week and last until the end of August. The renowned country group, The Statler Brothers (also from Staunton), performed their music at the annual \\"Happy Birthday, USA\\" Fourth of July festival at the park. During winter months, Gypsy Hill Park is adorned with lights and decorations for the Christmas and holiday season. In addition to the live music, Gypsy Hill Park hosts an annual festival throughout the Memorial Day weekend called Art in the Park, where local artists, musicians, and vendors set up tents showcasing their artwork and wide selection of crafts. An array of performers take stage on the bandstand, and a designated children's craft station allows kids to participate in multiple activities.  In artwork  Famous Shenandoah folk artist Grandma Moses, who was a resident of Augusta county for eighteen years, painted a picture of Gypsy Hill Park which sold on January 31, 2016 for almost six thousand dollars at the Augusta Expo in Fishersville, Virginia.

Biography Pfeffer was born in Austria-Hungary and in 1912 emigrated to United States with his parents and siblings. After finishing his school, he studied at the City College of New York and after graduation continued in 1930-1933 at the New York University School of Law. He was raised a Conservative Jew and attended religious services, yet later quipped (in a speech made before Freedom From Religion Foundation) that \\"the Orthodox consider me to be the worst enemy they've had - since Haman in the Purim story!\\" After admission to the Bar Pfeffer had a general law practice in Manhattan from 1933 to 1945. Between 1945 and 1964 he was Legal Adviser of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). In the latter capacity he was known for his adherence to ideas of secular humanism, which he elaborated in number of publications. In addition he was also 1954-1958 lecturer at the New School for Social Research in New York City. Pfeffer became the director of AJC's Commission on Law and Social Action in 1957. Pfeffer lectured at the New School from 1954 to 1958 and taught at Mount Holyoke College from 1958 to 1960, then at Yeshiva University in 1962 and 1963. He had honorary degrees from Hebrew Union College and Long Island University. In 1964 Pfeffer became professor of political science at the Long Island University, where he taught until his retirement in 1980. In that period he wrote several books on religious freedom, the separation of religion and state, and the corresponding decisions of the US Supreme Court. After 1964 he also served AJC as special counsel, and did legal work on behalf of other groups, including the Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty. For his commitment to civil rights and liberties and his humanistic attitude the American Humanist Association awarded him the prize Humanist of the Year in 1988. Since 1937 Pfeffer was married to Freda Plotkin. They had two children: Alan Israel Pfeffer and Susan Beth Pfeffer. On Separation of Church and State Pfeffer's book Church, State and Freedom, was called a \\"masterpiece\\" and the ultimate sourcebook for the history of the evolution of the all-American principle of the separation of church and state. Pfeffer called himself a \\"strict separationist in contrast to what is called 'accommodationist.'\\" By account of contemporaries, for most of the 1950s Pfeffer remained the dominant individual force in managing the flow of church- state litigation in state and federal courts intended to test the constitutionality of the religious oath requirement, school, prayer, and Bible reading - a role Pfeffer retained well into the early 1970s. While he was with AJC, Pfeffer argued cases before the Supreme Court and wrote numerous legal briefs. In 1961 he attained wide attention when he argued the case of Torcaso v. Watkins before the Supreme Court that a provision in the Constitution of Maryland requiring an express belief in the existence of God as a condition for the admission to holding of a public office, was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 1961 that states could not compel officeholders to declare a belief in God, striking down a provision of the Maryland Constitution on the ground that it was a \\"religious test for public office\\" invading the individual's right to religious freedom. Pfeffer later pleaded \\"partly guilty\\" to inadvertently perpetuating the myth that \\"secular humanism\\" is a religion. In defending atheist Roy Torcaso's case challenging a religious test in Maryland to become a notary public, Pfeffer wrote that \\"there are religions which are not based on the existence of a personal deity.\\" (His examples were ethical culturists, Buddhists and Confucians). \\"My good friend Justice Black thought that wasn't good enough. He put in the secular humanists. Who told him secular humanism? I didn't have it in my brief! I couldn't sue, because you can't sue a justice of the Supreme Court. But since then I rued the day\\".

It has achieved notability outside its local area, having hosted such bands as The Stone Roses, Radiohead, Green Day and Oasis, in its over-30 year history. The club opened in October 1984, and Kaiser Chiefs performed there as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations in 2014. History In late 1984 the venue, which was formerly a terraced house that narrowly escaped a Luftwaffe bomb during the Blitz on Hull, and later had a spell as a working men's club, became The New Adelphi Club. Part of a Victorian residential street built in 1888 in the west of Hull, and named after the Earl de Grey and Ripon, 89 De Grey Street survived whilst the bomb scored a direct hit on a couple of adjacent properties. To this day the bomb site serves as a small car park next to the club. The club, whose owner Paul Jackson built on small beginnings, has hosted an eclectic range of national and international acts. The small intimate venue has remained shabby chic, ramshackle and idiosyncratic, but has retained a unique atmosphere as the colours of the interior walls changed from green to brown and back to green again. The venue contains a front room containing a pool table, and the bar area which is featured in CAMRA's 2015 version of the Good Beer Guide. This area remains open in the evening from 8 pm, irrespective of whether there is any live entertainment taking place. Otherwise the main concert room has hosted thousands of musicians over the years including those just commencing their careers such as Pulp, Green Day and Radiohead; plus local boys The Housemartins who first appeared there in 1988. Others appearing included The Stone Roses, Supergrass and Mumford & Sons. Oasis played at the Adelphi the day before the release of their first single, whilst Radiohead played there twice. Their second appearance was in 1992 around the time of their hit single, \\"Creep\\".

In 2009, a series of gigs were held, coupled with an exhibition and live performance at the Ferens Art Gallery, to celebrate the New Adelphi's silver anniversary. On 19 September 2014, BBC Look North broadcast details informing viewers of a forthcoming concert at the New Adelphi by the Kaiser Chiefs, which led to the 200 available tickets being sold out in less than two hours. A video by the local film maker Mark Richardson also documented events at the Adelphi minutes after the live television broadcast. At the same time, Kaiser Chiefs' bassist Simon Rix stated, \\"In our 13 years on the UK touring scene we've never had the chance to play the legendary, Hull Adelphi. It's a massive hole in an illustrious career. Smaller venues are so important to supporting new music but with many around the country closing down, it‚Äôs great to see the Adelphi celebrating its 30th birthday. We're looking forward to finally playing there\\". A film capturing Kaiser Chiefs performance was made, which was shown at the Adelphi in January 2015 as part of Independent Music Venue Week. In October 2015, the film was screened at the 2015 Tucson Film & Music Festival in Arizona, United States.

The inaugural event took place on March 12, 2016 at the Ricoh Coliseum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Nine matches (including two dark matches) were contested at the event. The main event saw Triple H defeat Dean Ambrose to retain the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Other prominent matches included The New Day retaining the WWE Tag Team Championship against Sheamus and King Barrett (of The League of Nations), The Revival retained the NXT Tag Team Championship against Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady, Brock Lesnar defeated Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper in a 2-on-1 handicap match, and Charlotte retained the WWE Divas Championship against Natalya in the last televised defense of the Divas Championship.  Storylines  The card consisted of seven matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers. Storylines were played out on WWE's primary television programs, Raw and SmackDown, along with WWE's developmental branch NXT. On the February 29 episode of Raw, Dean Ambrose challenged Triple H to a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Later that night, Triple H interfered in Ambrose's match against Alberto Del Rio, causing a disqualification. Ambrose attacked Triple H, but Triple H stopped his onslaught with a Pedigree. He then accepted the challenge before attacking Ambrose again. The match was scheduled for Roadblock. On the March 2 episode of NXT, NXT Tag Team Champions The Revival were scheduled to defend their titles against Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady at Roadblock. At the Royal Rumble, Brock Lesnar eliminated Luke Harper, Erick Rowan, and Braun Strowman of The Wyatt Family from the Royal Rumble match. However, the trio re-entered the ring and eliminated Lesnar from the match. On the March 3 episode of SmackDown, a match between Brock Lesnar and Bray Wyatt was scheduled for Roadblock. On March 8, WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day were scheduled to defend their titles against Sheamus and King Barrett (of The League of Nations) at Roadblock. On March 11, a non-title match between Divas Champion Charlotte and Natalya was scheduled for the event. In a pre-recorded segment aired immediately before the match, Natalya goaded Charlotte into putting her title on the line in what would be the last televised Divas Championship match.  Event  =Preliminary matches= The event opened with The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston) defending the WWE Tag Team Championship against The League of Nations (Sheamus and King Barrett). Big E executed a Big Ending on Barrett to retain the title. Next, Chris Jericho faced Jack Swagger. Jericho forced Swagger to submit to the Walls of Jericho to win the match. After that, The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder) defended the NXT Tag Team Championship against Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady. The Revival executed the Shatter Machine on Amore to retain the title. In the fourth match, Charlotte defended the WWE Divas Championship against Natalya. Charlotte pinned Natalya with a roll-up using the ropes for leverage to retain the title. The fifth match, originally pitting Brock Lesnar against Bray Wyatt, was changed into a 2-on-1 handicap match also involving Luke Harper. Wyatt remained outside the ring throughout the match. Harper executed a Big Boot, two Superkicks and a Discus Clothesline on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar executed five German Suplexes and an F5 on Harper to win the match. In the penultimate match, Sami Zayn faced Stardust. Zayn executed a Helluva Kick on Stardust to win the match. =Main event= In the main event, Triple H defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Dean Ambrose. During the match, Ambrose executed Dirty Deeds on Triple H for a three count, but the referee voided the count as Ambrose's foot was underneath the bottom rope. In the climax of the match, Ambrose executed a Diving Elbow Drop on Triple H, who was standing outside the ring. Ambrose attempted an Elbow Drop off the barricade on Triple H, who was draped on the announce table, but Triple H rolled off and Ambrose fell through the announce table. Triple H then executed a Pedigree to retain the title.  Reception  The event received mixed reviews. Jason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net commented, \\"Overall, Roadblock is what most of us thought it would be. They weren't going to shake up the WrestleMania lineup three weeks away. I know some fans convinced themselves it was possible, but it just never struck me as being realistic regardless of whether it would have made for a better WrestleMania lineup\\". James Caldwell of Pro Wrestling Torch wrote that Roadblock was a \\"glorified house show for the most part, but the toned-down, less-corporate production value was refreshing for a WWE broadcast\\". Regarding the main event, Caldwell said that the \\"false finish for Dean was interesting in that WWE is lacking goodwill heading into Mania and going that far with a false finish straddled the line of being more of a turn-off than heat-generator\\". John Powell of Canoe.ca summed up that there were \\"no surprises at a solid Roadblock... Although the overall show was far better than any of the WWE's recent pay-per-views, Roadblock did nothing at all to fuel any kind of excitement for WrestleMania or its feuds\\". For the main event, Powell wrote, \\"In the match of his career, Ambrose proved beyond a shadow of a doubt he is main event material, perhaps soon to be following in the legendary but demented footsteps of another unorthodox superstar, one Mick Foley\\". Powell also praised Canadians \\"Natalya, Chris Jericho and Sami Zayn all putting in exceptional performances\\", as well as the four NXT wrestlers who proved \\"why NXT is still the show to watch each and every week\\". However, commentator JBL was criticized after he \\"literally loses his mind and starts yelling\\". His grade went to Triple H vs. Dean Ambrose with 8 and a half out of 10 while Brock Lesnar vs. Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper got the worst with a 5 out of 10. Larry Csonka from 411mania.com gave the event a 7 stars out of 10 rating. The highest rated match was Ambrose vs. Triple H (4 stars), judging that the match \\"was a lot of fun and felt fresh, but it wasn't without its problems\\", while Stardust vs. Zayn was rated the lowest (1 star). Csonka also praised the NXT Tag Team Championship match (3 1/2 stars) and the WWE Tag Team Championship match (3 stars).

ranging from college students to retirees. The choir was founded by Geoffrey Spratt in November 1992. The choir specialises in the performance of large scale works. Members are auditioned prior to joining. There are four vocal sections: Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass. The choir rehearses on Monday evenings and the rehearsals are based in the Curtis Auditorium of the Cork Institute of Technology School of Music. Origins When the choir first started it was known as the Cork School of Music Symphony Orchestra Chorus. The first public performance was as part of the Cork International Choral Festival's 40th opening night celebrations on 22 April 1993 with the RT√â Concert Orchestra in the City Hall in Cork. The programme included music by Aloys Fleischmann. Fleischmann was one of the founders of the Festival, and was its longest-serving Director. He died in 1992, a year previous to the 40th festival. As a result of these connections and with the family's blessing, the choir name was changed to honour the man who has been singled out as having done more than any other for choral singing and choral music in Ireland. Musical Director The choir was founded by and led by Dr. Geoffrey Spratt until 2013. He was the director of the CIT School of Music and founder of other choirs including the Irish Youth Choir and Canticum Novum. Dr. Spratt is the Conductor Emeritus of the choir. Since 2013, Conor Palliser has been director of the choir. International Tours The Fleischmann Choir has enjoyed successful musical collaborations with choirs from Dachau and Cologne in Germany and Como in Italy. As a result, the choir has performed in these cities with the most recent tours including performances in the Philharmonie in Cologne in 2014, and Como Cathedral in 2017. Additionally, the choir has performed in locations throughout Ireland and Great Britain.

As senior army camp chaplain in Queensland from 1914 to 1917, Garland experienced the World War I both at home and at the front. He was one of the originators of the now annual Anzac Day ceremonies. Described as \\"overpoweringly energetic with a distinctive flair, if not genius, for organisation\\", he played a pivotal role in the Queensland experience of the war, and was a central figure in a variety of committees and organisations established to aid the war effort and support or commemorate serving or returned soldiers.  Early life  Canon David John Garland, as a young man David John Garland was born in Dublin on 4 October 1864, the son of James Garland and his wife Mary Ann (n√©e Saunders). He studied law and immigrated with his parents to New South Wales. Garland came to Brisbane in 1886. He worked in Toowoomba as a law clerk, where he was influenced by Reverend Tommy Jones at St James‚Äô in Toowoomba and converted from his Irish Protestant faith to Anglo-Catholicism. He became a lay reader at St James. Garland entered the Church of England ministry in 1889. He served as a deacon in Grafton, Quirindi and Narrandera in New South Wales. In 1892 he was sent to Perth, Western Australia, where he was ordained as a missionary priest by Bishop of Perth Henry Parry. In 1892 he married a widow, Mary Hawkins, n√©e Hadfield, and they had one son, David James Garland. From 1900 to 1902, he was canon of Perth. Garland was a crusader for religious education in schools and devoted much energy to the Bible in State Schools League. During the Boer War, he was chaplain to the soldiers assembling at Fremantle before heading overseas. His last posting in Western Australia was at St John's in Northam, a congregation of whom he said \\"I never met a more docile and reverent congregation\\". In March 1902, he left Western Australia for St James's Church in Sydney to be a temporary replacement for Rev. Carr Smith who was travelling to Europe, but the move may also have been motivated by a fallout with his bishop in Western Australia. In Sydney he spoke out against the proposed federal Divorce Bill, arguing that making divorce easier would weaken marriage ties. In December 1902 Garland was appointed rector of St Paul's in Charters Towers, a canon of St James Cathedral, Townsville, Queensland and was appointed archdeacon of North Queensland in 1903. He continued his work in advocating bibles for state schools in Queensland. From 1907 to 1912, Garland was rector at Holy Trinity Anglican Church at Woolloongabba in Brisbane. In August 1912, Garland moved to New Zealand to lead the Bibles in Schools movement in that country.  World War I  Canon David John Garland, in uniform At the outbreak of war Garland was in Brisbane, and served as chaplain to soldiers in training camps, as they prepared for active service overseas. He also organised the provision of Bibles and prayer books to Queensland soldiers at the front. As a Senior Army Chaplain, Garland worked tirelessly in the training camps in and around Brisbane and further afield. In 1915 he founded the Soldiers Help Society. He also travelled Queensland as honorary organising secretary of the Queensland Recruiting Committee, preaching to encourage greater enlistment. He was an ardent supporter of conscription, co-founded the Compulsory Service League, served on the Executive of the National Council for the Referendum and founder of the Universal Service League. Garland is perhaps most remembered as an architect and originator of Anzac Day ceremonies. In Queensland on 10 January 1916, Garland was appointed the honorary secretary of the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland (ADCCQ) at a public meeting which endorsed 25 April as the date promoted as ‚ÄúAnzac Day‚Äù in 1916 and ever after. Devoted to the cause of a non-denominational commemoration that could be attended by the whole of Australian society, Garland worked amicably across all denominational divides, creating the framework for Anzac Day commemorative services. Garland is specifically credited with initiating the Anzac Day march, the wreath-laying ceremonies at memorials and the special church services, the two minutes silence, and the luncheon for returned soldiers. Garland intended the silence to be used in lieu of a prayer to allow the Anzac Day service to be universally attended, allowing attendees to make a silent prayer or remembrance in accordance with their own beliefs. He particularly feared that the universality of the ceremony would fall victim to religious sectarian disputes. Through this period, Garland was an active correspondent with his fellow priest and army chaplain William Maitland Woods. Garland‚Äôs letters detailed his everyday duties as archdeacon and later canon in the Anglican Church. He detailed his involvement in the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee, and the establishment of Anzac Day in Queensland. He also wrote of his efforts in recruiting with varying degrees of optimism or despondency, depending on how the conscription debate was leaning. Both men exchanged news of their families, in particular their sons, who were on active service. The wartime letters cease in August 1917, with Garland‚Äôs news that he would be joining Woods in the Middle East, having been appointed representative of the Church of England in Australia to inquire into the \\"moral and social\\" needs of the Australian men in Egypt. With a large sum of money at his disposal, Garland had been placed in charge of the Church of England Fund for Soldiers at the Front. Garland travelled to Egypt and served 1918-19 in the Middle East where he founded eight clubs for Australian troops, and was the first chaplain to celebrate the Eucharist in the Anglican chapel of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre following the expulsion of the Turks from Jerusalem. In addition he raised funds for memorials and hospitals, and for soldiers‚Äô hostels and care of soldiers‚Äô graves at home and abroad. Later life Stone of Remembrance and Cross of Sacrifice in Toowong Cemetery, 2015 Upon his return to Queensland in 1920, Garland became rector of Ithaca and continued a diverse and illustrious career of community involvement, including presidency of the New Settlers‚Äô League from 1926. He was awarded an O.B.E. in 1934. From 1920 until 1930, Garland conducted Anzac Day ceremonies in Toowong Cemetery. In 1924, through his fund-raising efforts, a Cross of Sacrifice and Stone of Remembrance were placed in the cemetery. On Remembrance Day 1930, ANZAC Square in the Brisbane CBD was officially opened and the services at Toowong Cemetery were transferred to ANZAC Square. Garland died on 9 October 1939 and was buried on 10 October 1939 in Toowong Cemetery. Legacy The Canon Garland Memorial Society was established on 9 July 2013 at the Holy Trinity Anglican Church at Woolloongabba, Brisbane. The society seeks to honour David Garland's role during the Australian centenary commemorations of World War I. In November 2015, the Brisbane City Council officially opened a lawn garden called Canon Garland Place at Toowong Cemetery with a commemorative information board. Canon Garland Place is located where he held his Anzac Day services in the cemetery and behind The Cross of Sacrifice and Stone of Remembrance that were funded through Garland's fundraising activities. Canon Garland memorial, Kangaroo Point cliffs, 2016 In April 2016, a memorial to Garland was unveiled at the Kangaroo Point Cliffs in Brisbane. The bronze wreath was sculpted by Rhyl Hinwood. The State Library of Queensland holds various collections of Garland‚Äôs papers. In 2015, the State Library digitised his First World War letters. This collection consists of letters received by Garland from Australian army soldiers, nurses and chaplains serving abroad during World War I, as well as carbon copies of his replies. Also included are letters from his colleague The Reverend William Maitland Woods regarding the discovery, evacuation and transportation to Australia of the Shellal Mosaic. Transcriptions of the digitised letters are also available. Some of Garland‚Äôs letters are also part of the OM74-101 Maitland Woods Papers 1915-1916. As a result of a citizens e-petition, on 9 October 2019 (the 80th anniversary of the death of Garland), the overpass across the Western Freeway adjacent to the Toowong Cemetery (formerly known as the Toowong Bicycle and Pedestrian Overpass) was renamed the Canon Garland Overpass.

It was a consequence of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena withdrew from Finsoe from February 2007 to June 2008, which the shares of Finsoe was sold to Finsoe and Holmo.

The Arizona Department of Transportation is also currently studying a proposal to create inter-city rail between Tucson and Phoenix, with a corridor along the current I-10 highway. This project is known as the Arizona Passenger Rail Corridor Study (APRCS). History Daily rail service had existed until the 1960s between Phoenix, Glendale, and Wickenburg as well as Tempe and Mesa. Contemporary discussion of commuter rail in Phoenix began with the \\"Hattie B.\\" flood relief train of 1980, and was first widely promoted in 1991 by the Arizona Rail Passenger Association with the release of its Arizona Rail report. 2010 proposal The Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) and the Arizona Department of Transportation are studying suburban commuter rail as a complement to light rail. The MAG Commuter Rail Strategic Plan was released in March 2008. In April 2008, a coalition of Arizona business and political leaders, including then-Governor Janet Napolitano, proposed a $42 billion state transit plan which would include commuter rail. Commuter rail would run along upgraded existing freight rail lines, with stations every three to five miles (8 km). In Phoenix, as in other areas that have implemented commuter rail, track speeds would be increased, signals updated, and additional sidings and double-track added. 2018 proposal In October 2018, MAG issued an update to the 2010 study. This update removed the Chandler Corridor from a proposed commuter rail system, as it would have competed with San Tan Corridor Line for ridership. The Kyrene Line Corridor was also extended from its 2010-proposed terminus in West Chandler. The 2018 update includes four rail corridors which would be operated with two services. The Grand/Kyrene Line would utilize the Grand Line Corridor, traveling from Wittmann southeast towards Phoenix, and then continuing south on the Kyrene Line Corridor to Chandler, traveling in 66-73 minutes. The Estrella/San Tan Line would use the Estrella Line Corridor, traveling from Buckeye east into Phoenix, and then continuing southeast along the San Tan Line Corridor to Queen Creek, traveling in 74-82 minutes. The lines would overlap at four central stations: State Capital, Phoenix, Sky Harbor Airport, and Tempe. Provisions for extensions would allow for an additional Grand Avenue Corridor station in Wickenburg, two additional stations on the San Tan Line Corridor in San Tan Valley and Florence, and an extension of Estrella Line service to Arlington. Services would run at 30-minute headways during peak hours and 2-hour headways during off-peak hours. By the year 2040, the Grand/Kyrene Line would have 10,850 daily boardings and the Estrella/San Tan Line would have 10,125 daily boardings. The updated study estimated capital costs for rail systems using diesel multiple units (DMU) or push-pull trainsets (LHC). Capital costs assumed that service would share existing tracks with freight service (operated by Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway), except for the overlapping segment in Phoenix, where there would be two tracks. All tracks would be certified for passenger trains to reach . Costs were estimated at $2.566 billion for DMU service and $2.521 billion for LHC service. =Lines= Grand Line Corridor The Grand Line Corridor (formerly the Grand Avenue Corridor) is a line traveling from Union Station in Downtown Phoenix northwest to Wittmann. The corridor utilizes the BNSF Railway's Phoenix Subdivision, which already has sidings for passing trains but lacks any signals. A trip by car from Union Station to Wittmann utilizing the parallel Grand Avenue (U.S. Route 60) is projected to take 120 minutes by 2040. The population of the surrounding areas of the line ‚Äì Phoenix, Glendale, Peoria, Youngtown, El Mirage, Surprise, Sun City, Sun City West, and Wittmann ‚Äì is projected to grow by 46% between 2015 and 2040. In particular, the city of Surprise is forecasted to grow by 152%. The corridor will serve riders at various colleges and universities, including Arizona State University, Grand Canyon University, and Glendale Community College. Estrella Line Corridor The Estrella Line Corridor (formerly the Yuma West Corridor) is a line traveling from Union Station west to downtown Buckeye by way of the Union Pacific Railroad's Phoenix Subdivision. The line was served by Amtrak's Sunset Limited until June 1996, when it was rerouted to a more direct route via Maricopa rather than of Phoenix. Because of this, signals are already installed on the line and the line is already certified for passenger trains to operate at speeds of up to . The population of the surrounding areas ‚Äì Phoenix, Tolleson, Avondale, Goodyear, and Buckeye ‚Äì is projected to grow by 63% between 2015 and 2040. In particular, Buckeye and Goodyear are forecasted to grow by 216% and 137%, respectively. The corridor will serve the Goodyear Spring Training Complex and Phoenix Goodyear Airport, as well as the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station should a western extension of the corridor be built to Arlington. San Tan Line Corridor The San Tan Line Corridor (formerly the Southeast Corridor) is a line traveling from Union Station southeast to San Tan Valley by way of Union Pacific's Phoenix Subdivision. Like the Estrella Line Corridor, this corridor was formerly served by Amtrak until 1996 and is capable of handling passenger trains at up to . The line is a single track with sidings for passing trains. The population of the surrounding areas ‚Äì Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community ‚Äì is projected to grow by 47% between 2015 and 2040. In particular, Queen Creek is forecasted to grow by 101%. The corridor will serve airports at Sky Harbor and Mesa and the campuses of Arizona State University and East Valley Institute of Technology. Kyrene Line Corridor The Kyrene Line Corridor (formerly the Tempe Corridor) is a line from Union Station south to Wild Horse Pass Boulevard in the Gila River Indian Community by way of the Union Pacific Railroad line. Like the San Tan Line and Estrella Line corridors, this corridor was formerly served by Amtrak until 1996. Signals are still present from Amtrak service and the line is currently a single track. The population of the surrounding areas ‚Äì Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Guadalupe, Chandler, and the Gila River Indian Community is projected to grow by 45% between 2015 and 2040. The greatest population growth is forecasted for the city of Tempe at 50%. The line will serve Sky Harbor International Airport, the campuses of Arizona State University and the University of Phoenix, the Tempe Sports Complex, and the Wild Horse Pass Casino. =Phoenix Union Station= The 2018 and 2018 proposals call for a major expansion of the facilities at Phoenix Union Station. The station would have two island platforms for three through tracks and two additional island platforms for three termination tracks that would serve western service only.

Bogdan Radenkoviƒá (; Srbovac, Ottoman Empire, 1874 ‚Äì Thessaloniki, Greece, 30 July 1917) was a Serb activist, an organizer of the Serbian Chetnik Organization and one of the founders of the Black Hand. He was a leading civilian activist of the Pan-Serb movement in the early 20th century. In a letter to the Serbian government, dated 27 October 1909, he tells about the dangers faced by the population of Kiƒçevo and Prilep because of Arnaut incursions, and asks for approval of the troops of Gligor Sokoloviƒá and Dane Stojanoviƒá to solve the problem. Biography Born in 1874 in Srbovac, a village in the municipality of Zveƒçan, then part of the Ottoman Empire (and now Kosovo, still a contentious international political zone to this day). As a university graduate and a tonsured monk with a chosen name Vasilije, he became a secretary to the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Skopje. In this influential post, he had numerous contacts with his people and consulates of Serbia, Russia, and France. Among the clergy, he was known as Vasilije (Radenkoviƒá) and among the laity simply Bogdan Radenkoviƒá. Bogdan Radenkoviƒá was a member of the Serbian Committee of Skopje and the main organizer of the Serbian Chetnik action in the Ottoman Empire. He was an intermediary between the Serbian consulate and the Chetnik organization and their supporters. During 1905 the Turkish authorities caught a farmer who after being tortured revealed that Radenkoviƒá was the president of the Serbian Committee in Skopje. At the Skopje trial, the farmer recanted citing that his testimony was extracted by force and Radenkoviƒá was ultimately acquitted. Radenkoviƒá was a friend of Milan Rakiƒá, then Serbia's vice-consul in Skopje, with whom he conferred confidential operational plans of the Chetnik organization. Milan Rakiƒá at the time began writing a poem called \\"On Gazimestan\\" that became popular even before the Balkan War of 1912. Founding of the Serb Democratic League The Serb Democratic League in the Ottoman Empire (Serbian: –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∞ –¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞ —É –û—Ç–æ–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ—ò —Ü–∞—Ä–µ–≤–∏–Ω–∏) was an Ottoman Serb political organisation established on August 13, 1908, at the First Serb Conference (August 10‚Äì13), immediately after the Young Turk Revolution. Some 26 most distinguished Serbs in the Ottoman Empire attended and Bogdan Radenkoviƒá was selected to head the \\"Temporary Central Board of the Organization of Ottoman Serbs\\" in July 1908. Bishop Vicentije Krdziƒá of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Skopje headed the clergy and Bogdan Radenkoviƒá the lay membership of the \\"Assembly of Ottoman Serbs in Skopje\\", held on Sretenje in 1909. These organizations included the Serb elite of Old Ra≈°ka, Kosovo and Metohija, and Vardar Macedonia and Aegean Macedonia.[1] It included many members of the Serbian Chetnik Organization as well. They were: Bogdan Radenkoviƒá; Aleksandar Bukviƒá; Gligorije \\"Gli≈°a\\" Elezoviƒá; Vasa Jovanoviƒá; Milan ƒåemerikiƒá; Sava Stojanoviƒá; David Dimitrijeviƒá; ƒêorƒëe Hadzi-Kostiƒá; Velimir Preliƒá and Jovan ≈†antriƒá. With the founding of the Serb Democratic League, it became the first political party to represent the interests of the Serbs in the Ottoman Empire. The Serbian Democratic League sent to Thessaloniki Bogdan Radenkoviƒá, Jovan ≈†antriƒá and ƒêorƒëe Had≈æi-Kostiƒá to negotiate with the Central Young Turk Board. The Serbian demands were as follows:for the three non-Muslim ‚Äúethnic groups‚Äù ‚Äì Serbian, Greek and Bulgarian ‚Äì to get equal number of seats in the Ottoman Parliament. But the Young Turks refused that concept and they conditioned the electoral agreement with the Serbs with having an agreement on broader bases that would not have a national background. In 1910 as a representative of the party, he was sent to Istanbul where he urged the Turkish authorities to stop using their troops (Bashi-bazouk) to terrorize the Serbian population in Gjilan. The Sublime Porte denied the violence in Kosovo claiming that it was a fabrication. Yet to the Albanians are credited many of the outrages that have been committed in Old Serbia, where Turkish troops are alleged to have massacred more than 60,000 Christians. Black Hand Radenkoviƒá and a few others, particularly Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá, were the initiators of the creation of the \\"Unification or Death\\" organization, better known as the Black Hand, in 1911. Along with Ljuba ƒåupa and Vojislav Tankosiƒá, Radenkoviƒá wrote the constitution of the \\"Unification or Death\\" organization, which was modelled on similar German secret nationalistic associations and the Italian Carbonari. Bishop After bishop Niƒáifor Periƒá of Ra≈°ka-Prizren withdrew from his office (1911), owing to disagreement with the Serbian diplomacy, the Patriarchate of Constantinople appointed Bishop Gavrilo Do≈æiƒá as successor, as the Serbian diplomacy wanted. There was a conflict within the Serbian Church regarding the appointment of Gavrilo; the \\"Old Serbs\\" (clergy from Kosovo and Old Serbia) wanted their candidate, the previous secretary of the Eparchy of Skoplje, monk Vasilije (Bogdan) Radenkoviƒá. While waiting for the Ottoman government approval, the Serbian government changed the decision and ordered through the consuls that Ottoman Serbs request that Radenkoviƒá be appointed instead. However, Gavrilo ended up being chosen. Meanwhile, Radenkoviƒá became a founder of the Black Hand conspiracy group. Secret Mission in Kor√ß√´ After the occupation of Serbia in late 1915 by the Germans, Austrians, Hungarians and Bulgarians, Bogdan Radenkoviƒá withdrew through Montenegro, Albania to the island of Corfu, where he was temporarily hospitalized with tuberculosis. When his condition improved somewhat he was sent to Athens and from there to Kor√ß√´ County in eastern Albania. There he stayed until August 1916 when a surprise Bulgarian invasion took place and he was forced to flee. He was almost caught while escaping but eventually managed to reach Thessaloniki, where the Serbian Supreme Command was stationed. Weak, suffering from tuberculosis after the harrowing escape from Kor√ß√´, he was advised by his doctor to go to Egypt where the climate may improve his condition. Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, however, purposefully delayed his departure until his condition worsened. High Military Court The Serbian Supreme Command on 15 March 1917 sent a warrant for Bogdan Radenkoviƒá's arrest, though the main accused was Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá, better known as Apis, and his associates. Radenkoviƒá was sentenced to death for allegedly plotting against the prince regent Aleksandar Karadjordjeviƒá and Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, the head of the Serbian government-in-exile, even though there was no concrete evidence that could link him to such an outrageous plot, not him nor Dimitrijeviƒá and others. Bogdan Radenkoviƒá died of tuberculosis in a prison hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece on 30 July 1917. Years later it was revealed that Nikola Pa≈°iƒá fabricated the story to rid himself of Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá and other Serbian nationalists that may pose a threat after the war during election time. All the accused were vindicated, but many years later.

Peregrin is a multivalent chromatin regulator that recognizes different epigenetic marks and activates three histone acetyltransferases (Moz, Morf and Hbo1). BRPF1 contains two PHD fingers, one bromodomain and one chromo/Tudor- related Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP) domain.  Function  Brpf1 forms a stable complex with Moz/Morf-Hbo1 and targets to chromatin to regulate transcription. Brpf1 null mutant mouse dies at embryonic day 9.5. Forebrain-specific knock out of Brpf1 cause hypoplasia in the dentate gyrus of mouse. = Embryo development = Brpf1 gene is very conserved and has a critical role in different developmental processes. Zebrafish BRPF1, which is coordinated by its particular set of PWWP domains, mediates Moz -dependent histone acetylation and maintains Hox genes expression throughout vertebrate development, hence determines the proper pharyngeal segmental identities. Furthermore, Brpf1 may not only has significant role for maintaining the anterior-posterior axis of the craniofacial skeleton, but also the dorsal- ventral axis of the caudal skeleton. Recent studies have shown that ablation of the mouse Brpf1 gene causes embryonic lethality at embryonic day 9.5. Specifically, Brpf1 regulates placenta vascular formation, neural tube closure, primitive hematopoiesis and embryonic fibroblast proliferation. For the central nervous system, Brpf1 has high expression and is essential for the development of several important structures, including neocortex and dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. Brpf1 is dynamically expressed during forebrain development, especially the hippocampal neurogenesis. Brpf1 shares phenotypes with transcription factors Sox2, Tlx and Tbr2 in dentate gyrus development and has potential link to neural stem cells and progenitors. Except for the forebrain, Brpf1 is also required for the proper patterning of the craniofacial cartilage, which is derived from neural crest cells that migrate from the hindbrain. = Cancer development = Recently, Brpf1 was reported to play the tumor suppressor or oncogenic role in several malignant tumors, including leukemia, medulloblastoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma. Brpf1 was considered a tumor suppressor gene because mutations in cancer cells appear to diminish the function of Brpf1 However, oncogenic role of Brpf1 is also possible in cancer. For example, Brpf1 can form a stable complex with Moz- Tif2, which could lead to the development of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There is another Brpf1 related complex Brpf1‚ÄìIng5‚ÄìEaf6, which also plays a direct role in cancer.

Since then, there have been approximately 20,500 burials registered. The cemetery features a soldiers' memorial and an historic two-tiered Chinese funeral burner, which served as a safe place for the ritualized burning of spiritual tributes.

History The Castle of Cerveira as seen in the Livro das Fortelezas (1509/1510) of Duarte d'Armas Another view of the Castle from the Livro das Fortelezas In the 13th century, the castle was included as part of the nuptial dowry of D. M√©cia, wife of King D. Sancho II. It was also referred to in 1229 in a document referencing the village of Elvas, naming the nobles who signed the charter; Pedro Nov√£es, the tenens of the castle of Cerveira was identified, suggesting that the castle was merely a defensive tower.The document refers to Domus Petrus Novaes tenens castellum. During the 1258 Inquiri√ß√µes (Inquiries) noted the obligations of the residents of Cerveira and its surrounding parishes. Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida indicated that the castle of Cerveira, was already known in the 13th century as the vila nova (new town), owing to the original Cerveira being situated in the mountains (possibly over the hilltop of Esp√≠rito Santo, in Penafiel, parish of Roboreda), or in Cornes. In 1320, King D. Dinis ordered that the settlement be colonized. To this end, the King issued a foral (charter), with one-third of the supported payments be used for the conservation of the castle. The courtyard, limited by the walls was too small for the 100 homes that King D. Dinis expected to settlement the village; ultimately, he accepted the construction of a settlement that was constructed outside the walls. The design if Duarte d'Armas, in his Livro das Fortalezas, indicates that at the beginning of the 16th century, the barrio outside the walls was more complete then those in the interior, including two religious buildings. Following the outbreak of the Portuguese succession crisis, the castle alcalde and village remained loyal to Castile. In the spring of 1385, the Constable Nuno Alvares Pereira, after conquering the Castle of Neiva began a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela and stopped to rest in Vila Nova de Cerveira for the night. Between the 14th and 15th century, the barbican was constructed under the reigns of King D. Fernando or King D. Jo√£o I. King D. Afonso V (1438-1481) rewarded the exploits of D. Leonel de Lima, during the north Africa campaign by bestowing on him the title of 1st Viscount of Vila Nova de Cerveira (1476), and giving his possession of the lands of the village. Their successor, King D. Manuel reissued the orders to renovate the castle. The construction of the 16th century fortress, resulted from the fear of Spanish threats from across the border during the Restoration Wars, and was included in a line of defenses along the Minho River and Atlantic coast. On 25 September 1643, forces of Cerveira resisted attacks by troops loyal to King Philip IV of Spain, with the regions defenses organized by Governor Manuel de Lima e Abreu. Following these events, in 1650, the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda was constructed over the barbican. With the continued need to defend the territory, the 7th Viscount of Vila Nova de Cerveira ordered that the settlement be circled with walls, bartizans and four interior bastions (S√£o Miguel, Esp√≠rito Santo, Concei√ß√£o and Almas). In addition a half bastian and three smaller redoubts were established along the river. The courtyard had three gates: the Campanha Gate, the Church Gate, Nova Gate and Rio Gate. These public works were complete in 1667, under the direction of Field Marshall Francisco Azevedo, supported with the royal taxation on water and fife from the settlers. In 1718, Manuel Pinto Vilalobos measured and evaluated the lands in the interior of the fortification, for the purpose of sale in public competition. But, by 1742, the batteries received a new piece, in order to dominate the Fort of S. Louren√ßo de Gai√£o. In 1809, with the defense organized by the aged Colonel Gon√ßalo Coelho de Ara√∫jo (he was 77 years old at the time), the military square resisted Napoleon's Second Invasion during the Second Invasion Peninsular Wars, under the command of Nicolau Jean de Dieu Soult. They were successful in impeding their crossing the river. The growth in the local economy and need to support the growing population meant that the keep tower was demolished in 1844, and the following year the Afonsino tower, were partially destroyed to build other structures. Between 1845 and 1846, the wall's gates began to slowly be destroyed. With this slow deterioration, the castle slowly lost its importance, resulting in the 1875 authorization to demolish the fortress. The earliest attempt to recover importance of the castle began in 1905, with work done to repair wall cracks. The DGEMN Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (Directorate General for Buildings and National Monuments) began work in 1969 on consolidating and treating the diverse walls, and work was planned in 1977 to continue the consolidation. But, between 1977 and 1982, the fortifications and buildings were adapted for the establishment of the hostel. On 6 September 1982, the Pousada de D. Dinis was inaugurated within the interior of the medieval castle. There were a series of projects to benefit these changes on the site, including repaving the battlements, installation of new kitchens, bar and laundry. A project to partially adapt the first and second residences for the installation of a central phone centre. Work continued to recuperate the ceilings and exterior landscaping, alter the laundry ventilation and roadways between 1982 and 1985. Arcaheological excavations along the Rua Costa Brava along the medieval castle walls were undertaken in 2002. In 2004, the castle was approved for the Plano Director das Fortalezas transfronteiri√ßas do Vale do Minho (Minho Valley Transborder Fortress Directors Plan), under the Interreg III Program, which sought to inventory the built inventory, evaluate their state of conservation and determine strategies for preservation. The intent of the plan was to valorize, promote and determine the fort spaces in order to promote a cultural and tourist program for the margins of the Minho River. On 22 September 2006, a public presentation of the Plano de Pormenor de Salvaguarda do Centro Hist√≥rico (Detail Plan for Safeguarding the Historic Centre), coordinated by members of the municipal council, architect Sandro Lopes and archaeologist Paula Ramalho. Architecture The stone gates of the castle A view of the former municipal seat within the walls of the castle The castle is situated in an urban context, addorsed and distinct on the right bank of the Minho River, over a small portion of the wall, that extends along the border of the city. Its interiors are occupied by constructions adapted for their use as hostel, including its restaurant which is distinctly different then the surrounding classified structure. The castle has an oval plan, formed with 8 rectangular towers and a line of walls, and integrated into the S√£o Miguel bastion over the river and barbican oriented towards the town. Access to the rounded, barbican gate includes access to the rectangular body integrated with the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda. Below this space is the wall, creating an elbow. The frontispiece of the chapel has granite cornerstone, with rectangular pediment and a second floor doorway with interrupted frontispiece and varanda. The barbican continues towards the east, with circling walls and angular extensions, then tower followed by visible wall. Entrance to the castle occurs a double gate: a wall between the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda and tower, surmounted by coat-of-arms and sections of a former balcony; the second is above the tower, through a double vain, surmounted by the coat- of-arms of Portugal. Between this tower and the Church of the Miseric√≥rdia is a latrine encircled by two cantilevers. The interior courtyard is encircled by battlements accessed by stone staircases. The visible towers, some with, others without crowns are of different heights, with protruding parapets to the west. The bastion, framed with exterior stone, is accessible by a small \\"traitors\\" gate alongside a cistern. Among many of the buildings constructed inside the walls are the old residence of the governor, municipal seat, pillory, jail, barracks and storerooms, along with the Church of the Miseric√≥rida.

Lim opened fire with a K2 assault rifle and lobbied a hand grenade at soldiers at the barracks of the 22nd Infantry Division in eastern Gangwon Province, near the Demilitarized Zone with North Korea. After a shooting spree, he fled into the woods armed with his rifle and 60 rounds of ammunition. A massive manhunt was put underway with orders to \\"shoot and kill\\", involving 4,000 troops and dozens of helicopters. The next day, Lim was tracked down near a school and cordoned off, near the city of Goseong, six miles from the North Korean border. Negotiations went underway for his surrender. During a brief exchange of fire a South Korean platoon leader was injured, before Sgt. Lim attempted suicide, shooting himself in the abdomen. In February 2015, Lim was sentenced to death by a court-martial in Wonju. Under South Korean military law, a soldier must face the death penalty for killing a superior, and one of the victims of the killing spree was a staff sergeant.

It has helped found four other Methodist churches in the area: Community United Methodist, Great Bridge United Methodist, Messiah United Methodist, and Oaklette United Methodist It is located on the corner of North Battlefield and Great Bridge boulevards, and was the fourth Methodist church established in the Northampton County. The church's history dates back to the 1700s, and since then the church has established a wide variety of ministries and has been declared a historical structure. The church follows Methodism, a movement started by John Wesley in an effort to reform the Church of England from within.  History  The Cutherell family were the first Methodists in Tidewater Virginia. In 1770, one member of the Cutherell family, Daniel Cutherell, allowed his friends and relatives into his home so that they could pray and sing together in praise. Reverend Francis Asbury, the first American bishop of the Methodist Church, preached at Cutherell's house in 1800. In 1804, Bennet and Jinny Armstrong sold one half-acre lot of land for a place of worship to be built upon, and in 1808, a building for the new Cutherell Meeting House was constructed there. In 1840, the Cutherell Meeting House became a Methodist charge on a preaching circuit. In 1842, the building was lifted and moved on rollers with the use of mules to the intersection of Kempsville Road and Battlefield Boulevard. Ten years later, the name of the church was changed from Cutherell's Meeting House to Oak Grove Church, largely due to the grove of oak trees surrounding the location. Norfolk and Portsmouth experienced a yellow fever epidemic in 1855, sometimes referred to as the \\"Upshur fever,\\" that originated from the steamer Benjamin Franklin, and a temporary Oak Grove hospital was constructed so that church members could aid the community during that time. Volunteer companies of Virginia soldiers held drills and parades at the Oak Grove Church in 1861, and the Sixth Regiment of Virginia Volunteers was temporarily stationed on the church grounds. In 1862, Federal troops set up occupation and were stationed in most of the Hampton Roads area. Oak Grove Church was occupied from then until after the end of the Civil War in 1865. The interior was destroyed by the troops as they used the furniture and the surrounding grove of trees for firewood. In 1868, Oak Grove became a part of the East Norfolk Circuit. Three acres next to the church were bought in 1871, expanding the church's grounds. The church became a part of the South Norfolk Circuit in 1873. In 1890, Oak Grove was reimbursed by the United States government for damage done to the church and the surrounding trees during the Union Army's occupation of the building in the 1860s. In 1935, a church school was added to the sanctuary, and a fellowship hall was constructed in 1950. In 1976, the Oak Grove Church sanctuary was designated a \\"Historical Structure\\". A new building for the church finished construction and was opened in 2007. = Historical significance = Oak Grove United Methodist Church finds its roots in the family of the first Methodists in the Tidewater area, and has served to help establish multiple other churches within the area. The church has also served as a place for the volunteer companies of Virginia soldiers to hold drills and parades on, and has served as a building of occupation for the Union army. Before the Union army took hold of the structure, it functioned as a hospital for Confederate soldiers. Members of the church, including a mix of youth and adults, have helped to refurbish an orphanage in Costa Rica.  Ministries  The church hosts a variety of ministries. = Adult ministries = The adult ministries include different small groups, such as the Golden Oaks and the United Methodist Women. The United Methodist Men, a small group for the men of the church, promote fellowship and spiritual growth. = Children's ministries = Children's ministries include childcare, preschool, a Sunday school class for preschoolers and kindergartners called \\"Critterland,\\" and a Sunday school class for first through fifth graders called \\"The Treehouse\\". = Evangelism ministries = The evangelism ministries include Sunday servant teams, greeter ministries, usher ministries, hospitality station hosts, information desk hosts, and welcome gift deliverers. = Mission ministries = The Angel Tree is a program that allows members of the church to pick tags dedicated to specific children off of a Christmas tree and to bring a gift for that child back to the church, where other members will deliver it. C.A.S.T., the Chesapeake Area Shelter Team, allows members to donate items, food, or time to the homeless for a set week during the year. The church sends a check to the VA Methodist Annual Conference every year to help fund different projects, missions, and programs. The Chesapeake Care Free Clinic is a facility that is gives free medical and dental care to families that struggle to afford health insurance, and the church donates an annual check to help keep the clinic running. Oak Grove also gives a yearly check to the Chesapeake Jail Ministry, which provides counseling and Bible studies for inmates within the Chesapeake Prison System. A Chesapeake Point-in-Time Homeless Count is conducted biennially to count the number of homeless individuals in Chesapeake to determine the main causes of homelessness in the area, and Oak Grove partners with the program by having church members donate various items needed by those individuals. Senior high youth and adult leaders also often travel for a week long mission trip in Alajuela, Costa Rica, partnering with Strong Missions. A community dinner is held once a week at Oak Grove to serve families with low- income. Heart Havens provides a safe environment for adults with intellectual disabilities to live in, and the church regularly donates and volunteers within the community. Oak Grove serves a partnership with the Heart of Compassion Partnerships, an outreach program for the area. Paint Your Heart Out is an event sponsored by the Chesapeake Rotary Club that Oak Grove regularly participates in. The church also helps with many other ministries, including Chesapeake Serve the City, communion fund, disaster shelter team, faith works, Gideons, Great Bridge Food closet, House of Blessings Food Pantry, Meals on Wheels, missionary support, N.E.S.T., Park Place Soup Kitchen, Plant a Row, Project Homeless Connect, Providence Mobile Home Park, Red Cross Bloodmobile, and the Samaritan Fund. = Scouting ministries = Scouting ministries include Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Girl Scouts. = Youth ministries = Youth ministries include lounge and gym nights, youth small groups, confirmation class, and youth mission trips.

He was the first editor of the Toronto Leader and published a biography on his father-in-law William Lyon Mackenzie, The Life and Times of Wm. Lyon Mackenzie (1962). Life and career Charles Lindsey was born 7 February 1820 in Strubby, England, as the third son of Charles and Susannah Lindsey. He graduated from a grammar school in Lincoln and apprenticed at a press there. At 22 he emigrated to the Province of Canada to find employment as a writer. He first joined the staff of a newspaper in Port Hope where he wrote with a Reform slant. In 1846 publisher James Lesslie hired him for the Reformist Toronto Examiner. Lindsey became politically active and met regularly with those who were to form the Clear Grits faction in 1850, and gave voice to their views by publishing the North American with William McDougall. He was critical of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and opposed giving in to majority French-Canadian interests, writing \\"we shall get no real reforms from the French\\". The North American and Clear Grits lent its support to Francis Hincks, who became co- Premier in 1851. On 22 January 1852 Lindsey married Janet Mackenzie (d. 1906), a daughter of William Lyon Mackenzie. The couple had four sons and three daughters. When James Beaty, Sr., founded the Toronto Leader in 1852 he hired Lindsey as editor. There, Lindsey put his support behind Hincks's government, to the consternation of many Reformers who had become disappointed with Hincks. Lindsey's politics were liberal and avoided the extremes of the Tories and the Grits. The paper came to rival Brown's Globe in influence. Lindsey was appointed an honorary commissioner to the 1855 World Exposition in Paris. In 1862 he published a biography of William Lyon Mackenzie, arguing the long-term positive effects of the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. After a series of illnesses Lindsey left editorial work in 1867 to take a sinecure as registrar of deeds for Toronto, and continued to write political articles for the Mail, the Monetary Times, and the Canadian Monthly and National Review on issues such as free trade and separation of church and state. He became active in the nationalist Canada First movement, was a member of the movement's political arm, the Canadian National Association, edited the movement's organ The Nation, and named his son George Goldwin Smith after the Canada First co- founder Goldwin Smith. Lindsey was an inaugural member of the Royal Society of Canada upon its founding in 1882. He continued as registrar of deeds of western Toronto until he retired in 1906. He died after a short illness at his son George's home on 12 April 1908 and was buried in the Mackenzie plot at the Toronto Necropolis.

In field theory we come across two types of fields: finite fields and infinite fields. There are several examples of matrix fields of different characteristic and cardinality. There is a finite matrix field of cardinality p for each positive prime p. One can find several finite matrix fields of characteristic p for any given prime number p. In general, corresponding to each finite field there is a matrix field. Since any two finite fields of equal cardinality are isomorphic, the elements of a finite field can be represented by matrices. Contrary to the general case for matrix multiplication, multiplication is commutative in a matrix field (if the usual operations are used). Since addition and multiplication of matrices have all needed properties for field operations except for commutativity of multiplication and existence of multiplicative inverses, one way to verify if a set of matrices is a field with the usual operations of matrix sum and multiplication is to check whether # the set is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication; # the neutral element for matrix addition (that is, the zero matrix) is included; # multiplication is commutative; # the set contains a multiplicative identity (note that this does not have to be the identity matrix); and # each matrix that is not the zero matrix has a multiplicative inverse. Examples 1\\\\. Take the set of all n\\\\times n matrices of the form : \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & a & \\\\cdots & a \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} with a\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} that is, matrices filled with zeroes except for the first row, which is filled with the same real constant a. These matrices are commutative for multiplication: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & a & \\\\cdots & a \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} b & b & \\\\cdots & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} ab & ab & \\\\cdots & ab \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} =\\\\begin{pmatrix} b & b & \\\\cdots & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & a & \\\\cdots & a \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. The multiplicative identity is \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \\\\cdots & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. The multiplicative inverse of a matrix \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & a & \\\\cdots & a \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} with a eq 0 is given by \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{a} & \\\\frac{1}{a} & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{1}{a} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. 2\\\\. The set of matrices of the form : \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & -b \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & a \\\\end{pmatrix}, where a and b range over the field of real numbers, forms a matrix field which is isomorphic to the field \\\\mathbb{C} of complex numbers: a corresponds to the real part of the number, while b corresponds to the imaginary part. So the number 2+3i, for example, would be represented as : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & 2 \\\\end{pmatrix}. One can easily verify that i^2 = -1: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}^2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, and also, by computing a matrix exponential, that Euler's identity, e^{i\\\\pi}=-1 is valid: : e^{\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\pi & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\pi \\\\end{pmatrix}} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} .

He was a scion of a younger line of the Glanvill family, which had been established in East Anglia, especially Suffolk, since before 1086. He had several sons and daughters, the most prominent of which was Ranulf de Glanvill, who became justiciar of England. In 1144, Nigel, bishop of Ely, instructed Hervey and Ranulf to restore to the monks of Ely Cathedral the lands they were possessing at Bawdsey in Suffolk. In 1147, Hervey was the leader of an East Anglian contingent that joined the Second Crusade. When the fleet mustered at Dartmouth, he and the other crusading leaders formed a sworn commune for the duration of the crusade. During a stop in Portugal on the way to the Holy Land, they were asked by King Afonso I to help him take Muslim- held Lisbon. Hervey dominated the debate in the commune over the king of Portugal's request and, appealing to honour and unity, he convinced the commune to give its assistance. The De expugnatione Lyxbonensi, an eye-witness account of the successful Siege of Lisbon, was probably composed by a member of Hervey's retinue. There is no record, however, that would indicate whether Hervey ever made it to the Holy Land. Martim Moniz Metro Station, in Lisbon In 1150, Hervey took part in a joint meeting of the shire moots of Suffolk and Norfolk in the bishop's garden in Norwich. Also present were Nigel, bishop of Ely, and some other East Anglian tenants-in-chief. Before the moots, royal agents were seeking to set aside the immunities of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds in order to prosecute a certain Hubert and his accomplices. Hervey gave a speech in opposition to the government, citing his fifty years' experience of the shire moots and the tradition of abbatial independence. His argument was recorded by a neutral eye-witness, and it apparently swayed the assembly. Hervey was possibly still alive as late as 1166. If his own claim of lengthy experience with the shire courts can be trusted, he was an old man when his son Ranulf was born and a very old man at his death. It has been suggested that there were in fact two Herveys de Glanvill, but the two independent accounts of the Portuguese expedition and the East Anglian moots portray similar figures: eloquent, conservative, familiar with the law.

A performance lasts approximately eighteen minutes. History Villa-Lobos composed his First Quartet in Nova Friburgo, Brazil in 1915, originally under the title Su√≠te de Quartetos de Corda: Su√≠te Graciosa and in just three movements: \\"Cantilena\\" (Andante), \\"Can√ßonetinha Grega\\" (Allegretto), and \\"Brinquedo\\". This version, the manuscript of which is dated 5 March 1915, was given its first performance privately at the home of the Brazilian composer, pianist, and teacher Homero de S√° Barreto (1884‚Äì1924), on 3 December 1915. The score of this version, which was never given a public performance, is dedicated to the Quarteto de Friburgo, for whom it was written. In 1946, believing the original manuscript to have been lost, Villa-Lobos rewrote the score, adding three movements and retitling the work String Quartet No. 1. This version was performed in Rio de Janeiro for the first time by the Iacovino Quartet on 7 August 1946 . Analysis The quartet consists of six movements: #\\"Cantilena\\" (Andante) #\\"Brincadeira\\" (Allegretto scherzando) #\\"Canto l√≠rico\\" (Moderato) #Can√ßoneta (Andantino quasi allegretto) #\\"Melancolia\\" (Lento) #\\"Saltando como um Saci\\" (Allegro) The six short movements of this quartet take the form of a suite, alternating cantabile and dance movements . The lively and humorous second movement, titled \\"Brincadeira\\" (Joke), features effects of pizzicato, battendo coll'arco (striking the strings with the back of the bow), and harmonics, both natural and artificial . Throughout the third movement the melodic material is confined entirely to the viola and first violin . The composer describes this movement as \\"a deliberate and elevated caricature of romantic arias, transcending the delicious idea of a romanza sung by a baritone accompanied by a small provincial orchestra\\" . The fourth and fifth movements suggest passages in the Bachianas Brasileiras, particularly the violin melody in \\"Melancolia\\" resembles the \\"Canto do capad√≥cio\\" from Bachianas No. 2 Discography In order of date of recording: * Heitor.Villa-Lobos: Na m√∫sica de c√¢mara.

This early quartet in Villa-Lobos's catalogue is composed according to the cyclic principles developed by C√©sar Franck and Vincent d'Indy. Franck and Debussy were two of the most important influences on Villa-Lobos's early style, and he had studied d'Indy's 1912 textbook, Cours de Composition Musicale .

A performance lasts approximately twenty-three minutes. History Theatro Municipal, Rio de Janeiro, venue for the Third Quartet's premiere Villa-Lobos composed his Third Quartet in Rio de Janeiro in March 1916. It was first performed on 2 November 1919 at the Theatro Municipal, Rio de Janeiro, by a quartet consisting of Pery Machado and Mario Ronchini, violins, Orlando Frederico, viola, and Newton P√°dua, cello. The first North American performance took place on 16 January 1933 in Hollywood, performed by Samuel Albert and Doris Cheney, violins, Raymond Menhennick, viola, and Lysbeth LeFevre, cello . The UK premiere was given by the Stratton String Quartet (George Stratton and Carl Taylor, violins; Watson Forbes, viola; John Moore, cello) on 9 January 1934, at the Wigmore Hall, London . Because of the persistent percussive pizzicato patter in the second, scherzo movement, Villa-Lobos gave it the onomatopoeic, alliterative nickname \\"pipocas e pot√≥cas\\" (popcorn and tall tales), and this nickname is also applied to the entire quartet . Analysis The quartet, like all but the first of Villa-Lobos's works in the medium, consists of four movements: #Allegro non troppo #Molto Vivo #Molto Adagio #Allegro con fuoco The opening of the first movement establishes a motive that recurs throughout the quartet in various transformations. At first, it recalls Prokofiev or Shostakovich, but later is given a context more suggestive of Ravel. The generally pentatonic melodic contours and long ostinatos initially tend toward monotony and inexpressiveness, but the ostinatos give way to a more plastic and lively treatment later in the movement. The second movement, Molto vivo, was listed in the programme for the premiere performance as \\"Scherzo satirico\\". Like the first movement, it is largely dependent on ostinatos, but in place of pentatonic melodies its thematic material utilizes the whole-tone scale. The third, slow movement, transforms the leitmotif into something resembling the theme of the piano piece Lenda do caboclo. The finale restates motives from all of the preceding parts, especially the main subject of the first movement, to produce a cyclic formal closure. However, despite this motivic cross-referencing, Villa-Lobos does not take advantage of the possibilities this offers for the kind of rich thematic development found in the Viennese classical masters . Lisa agrees with Tarasti's assessment, stating that Villa-Lobos rarely develops his musical ideas, but instead merely uses them as stereotyped, repeated formulas, in contrast to composers who relate their different themes, or have evolved them all from a common germ cell. With specific reference to the Third Quartet, she finds the thematic material is \\"clearly stated and is obviously suitable for development\\", but that Villa-Lobos fails to provide this development, which is essential to sonata form, instead letting the themes \\"take their course through the instruments exactly as they were originally conceived\\" . Paulo , however, contests this view. According to his analysis, both of the main themes of the first movement are taken from the same germ motive, which permeates not only the exposition but the entire first movement of the quartet, \\"in a process of continuous variation\\", and compares this high thematic density to the music of Joseph Haydn. Villa-Lobos emphasizes the beginning of the recapitulation in the first movement with a sudden change of register of the accompanying triplets. At bar 153 (rehearsal-number 12), over an augmentation of the first cyclic theme, he introduces for the first time a figuration evoking the call of a Brazilian bird called sabi√° da mata (English name: cocoa thrush). This call occurs in several of Villa-Lobos's later works, including the Fourth and Eighth String Quartets, but most notably in the second movement (Dan√ßa: Martelo) of the Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5, where text by Manuel Bandeira names the bird. This is the only moment in this quartet where there is any hint of nationalism . Discography Chronological, by date of recording. *Villa-Lobos: Quatuors a Cordes Nos. 1‚Äì2‚Äì3.

Typically these have been used in stationary and workbench applications; however, mobile industrial robots introduce a new method for lean manufacturing. With advances in controls and robotics, current technology has been improved allowing for mobile tasks such as product delivery. This additional flexibility in manufacturing can save a company time and money during the manufacturing process, and therefore results in a cheaper end product. Mobile robot technology has potential to revolutionize many sectors of industry; however, it carries with it some disadvantages. The logistics of manufacturing will be streamlined by allowing robots to autonomously navigate to different areas for their work. The labor demands for employees will be lessened as robots will be able to work alongside humans, and robots will assist with medicine and surgery more and more. However, there are drawbacks to this technology. Coordinating the movement of robots around facilities and calibrating their position at their destination is tedious and far from perfect. A robot malfunctioning in a manufacturing setting will hold up production - and this robot could malfunction anywhere in a facility. Human safety must also be considered. Robots must prioritize the safety of human operators over their programmed task - which may complicate the coordination of multiple autonomous robots. Especially in a surgical setting, there is no room for error on the robot's part. Even though some challenges are present, mobile robot technology promises to streamline aspects across much of the industry.  History  Automation began in the automobile industry in the years surrounding WWII (1946) and the origin of the term itself belongs with D.S. Harder, the engineering manager at the Ford Motor Company. At first, the term was used to describe the increased presence of automatic devices in production lines and solely manufacturing contexts. Now, automation is widely used in many industries where computerized action and feedback loops can replace human intervention in the workplace. Over time, development in this area has become increasingly dependent upon advanced computer technologies and the advancement of processing capabilities. In its current form, most industrial robots are powered mechanical arms with the ability to perform anthropomorphic actions. Advancements in miniaturization of computers, mathematical control theory as well as improved sensory technologies have had great impact on the feedback control systems that drive robotics. The first industrial robot performed spot welding and die castings in a General Motors factory in New Jersey, USA in 1962. Soon, robotic arms were exploding within the large-scale manufacturing industry and several new companies came into existence including Kuka in 1973, Nachi in 1969, Fanuc in 1974, Yaskawa in 1977, ASEA in 1977, and several others. By 1980, it is estimated a new major robotics company entered the market every month. Mobile robotics are now set to experience similar expansion as they become significantly more reliable in an industrial setting. Even if a mobile robot makes mistakes, it will eventually be less frequently than mistakes caused by human factors.  Overview  MiR100, a frontrunning example product for mobile industrial robots. The simplicity of mobile industrial robots provide their main advantage in industrial settings due to the ease of use and ability to be operated via technologies well understood by most people. In addition, robots are able to operate almost continuously and will never complain about long work hours; greatly increasing efficiency in a lean manufacturing environment. The main current disadvantage lies in high costs of repair as well as the production delays that would be caused by a failure or malfunction. These factors are very preventative to putting major amounts of responsibility on mobile robotics, however they are being continually lessened.  Applications of mobile industrial robots  The mobile industrial robots have many applications that they have been used in already including in the healthcare industry, home and industrial security, ocean and space exploration, the food service industry, and in distribution applications. = Medicine = Mobile industrial robots have several uses within the healthcare industry in both hospitals and homes. Drug delivery, patient services, and other nursing functions could be easily adapted to robots. Due to the fact that items being carried around typically weigh less than 100 kg, robots much smaller than the MiR (see above) may be used. Specialized equipment may be mounted on robots, allowing them to assist with surgical procedures. Overall, their place in the medical industry is to provide a more reliable source of customer care while reducing human error. = Scientific experimentation and exploration = In the scientific world, there is a large number of applications for mobile robots. Their ability to perform experiments and exploration without putting human lives in danger makes them an important asset. Unlike humans, robots do not require life support systems to function. In space travel, robots are performing science on planets and asteroids because sending humans is far more taxing on resources and money. The same is true in the oceanography domain. In fact, several of the same robotic systems are designed to perform their science under both conditions - space and underwater. In nuclear power plants, robots can service electronics and mechanical systems which prevents human exposure to large amounts of radiation. = Aircraft maintenance and repair = Air-Cobot is a collaborative mobile robot able to inspect aircraft. Picture of the robot in Air France Industries. For applications like painting and de-painting aircraft, two fixed robots are inadequate because not all parts of the aircraft can be reached. Adding more fixed robots would complete the task, but the cost is prohibitive. If mobile robots are used, one or two may be enough to service the entire aircraft because they can move to whatever area needs work. Mobile robots need to be truly autonomous to be useful in manufacturing. Erik Nieves said, ‚ÄúMobility moves robots from being machines to production partners [...]‚Äù Rather than bringing work to the robot, the robot should be smart enough to go to where the work is. Automated aircraft inspection systems have the potential to make aircraft maintenance safer and more reliable. Various solutions are currently developed: a collaborative mobile robot named Air-Cobot,I. Jovancevic, I. Viana, T. Sentenac, J.J. Orteu and S. Larnier, Matching CAD model and images features for robot navigation and inspection of an aircraft, International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods, pp. 359-366, February 2016. and autonomous drones from Donecle or EasyJet. =Pipeline maintenance= For maintenance of pipelines which are buried underground, mobile robots can travel through the pipeline performing inspection and maintenance operations, replacing other techniques, some of which could only otherwise be done by unearthing the pipeline.

A performance lasts approximately 23 minutes. History Villa-Lobos composed his Fourth Quartet in 1917, in Rio de Janeiro, but the work remained unperformed until 1949, at which time the composer revised the score. This version was premiered by the Borgerth String Quartet (also known as the Carioca Quartet) on 8 October 1949 in Rio de Janeiro. The score is dedicated to Frederico Nascimento Filho. Analysis The quartet consists of four movements: #Allegro con moto #Andantino (tranquillo) #Scherzo (Allegro vivace) #Allegro The Fourth Quartet marks the end of Villa-Lobos's early period of exploration of the form. It is somewhat simpler than its three predecessors, and the parts move more independently and expressively. The main theme of the first movement strongly recalls the opening measures of the First and Second Quartets, but the second movement introduces a Brazilian character with a cello melody that avoids the second scale degree, like the Afro- Brazilian Xang√¥ tunes .

A performance lasts approximately 17 minutes. History Villa-Lobos composed his Fifth Quartet in S√£o Paulo in 1931. The manuscript bears a dedication to the federally appointed Governor (Interventor) of the State of S√£o Paulo from 26 November 1930 to 25 July 1931, though his name does not appear in the published score. The circumstances of the quartet's first performance are not recorded . The Quarteto popular is the first of a pair of quartets written in the 1930s, and marks a return by Villa- Lobos to the string quartet after a hiatus of fourteen years. Its composition also coincides with the composer's return to Brazil after a lengthy period spent mainly in Paris, and its marked turn to nationalism is associated with the political programme of the Getulio Vargas regime . The subtitle, \\"Quarteto popular\\", likely refers to the use of actual popular Brazilian melodies. Villa-Lobos himself declared that this quartet is among his weaker compositions . Analysis This quartet, like all of Villa-Lobos's quartets except the first, consists of four movements: #Poco andantino #Vivo e energico #Andantino ‚Äì tempo giusto e ben ritmato #Allegro The Fifth Quartet is unusual in Villa-Lobos's works in this medium for using genuine folk material, albeit in modified form . Over the course of the first movement the tempo changes many times, ranging from Lento to Presto. The long Lento section in b. 90 to 136 is characterised by lyrical melodic writing in the first violin accompanied by a complex rhythmic pattern in the other instruments . The second movement's predominantly fast tempo is also interrupted after eleven bars by a Lento section featuring double stops in all four instruments and sul ponticello tremolo effects in the two violins. After eight bars, the opening tempo is resumed for the remainder of the movement, save for a concluding Molto lento coda of five bars . The third movement inverts the relationship found in the first two movements by interrupting a predominantly slow tempo after only two bars with a fast and light-hearted section (Tempo giusto e ben ritmato) of sufficient length to make the opening material sound merely like a slow introduction. After twenty-three bars, however, a slow tempo (Adagio) is resumed, eventually giving way to the original Andantino . The short opening Andantino motive, played in unison, is one that Villa-Lobos often uses to suggest Indian music . The finale, in contrast to the earlier movements, maintains a steady Allegro tempo throughout . After a brief introduction in parallel fourths, the main theme from the first movement returns, at double its original tempo but in the same key. A series of children's themes taken from Villa-Lobos's collection, Guia pr√°tico, provides the substance for the rest of the movement. The central section is based on the song \\"O Bast√£o ou mia gato\\" (The Stick or a Cat's Meow), played in harmonics in all four instruments, after which the opening section, minus the introduction, is repeated to create an ABA ternary form .

A performance lasts approximately 24 minutes. History Villa-Lobos composed his Sixth Quartet during 1938 in Rio de Janeiro, and it was first performed in the same city by the Quarteto Haydn on 30 November 1943, on the same programme as the premiere of the Seventh Quartet. The published score bears no dedication, but the manuscript is dedicated to the violist Orlando Frederico , who many years earlier had participated in the premieres of both the Second and Third Quartets. Together with the Fifth Quartet, this work is marked by a deliberate move toward a more \\"popular\\" style, incorporating elements of Brazilian popular music, and the Sixth is regarded as the most nationalistic of all Villa-Lobos's string quartets . Villa-Lobos originally planned to designate this work as the second \\"popular quartet\\" (the Fifth Quartet is subtitled \\"Quarteto popular no. 1\\"), but in the end abandoned the idea of such a series . At the same time, it is with this quartet that the references to the quartets of Haydn, which continue throughout the composer's later quartets, become clear for the first time Analysis This composition, like all of Villa-Lobos's quartets except the first, consists of four movements: # Poco animato # Allegretto # Andante, quasi adagio # Allegro vivace Instead of the usual sonata-allegro form, the first movement presents a sectional structure. Four contrasting sections (with transitions between the first and second, and between the third and fourth) are followed by a recapitulation of the first section, and an extended coda. There is no development section . The second movement is in a three-part, ABA song form in the character of the Brazilian improvised serenade known as the choro . The A section is homophonic, while the central B section features imitative textures and a xang√¥-like theme set against a syncopated accompaniment in quadruple time (; ). The third movement is also in ternary form, but with a variation. The A section falls into two parts, which are reversed in order when A is recapitulated after the central B section . The tonal language and textural features of the outer sections resemble those of the Bachianas Brasileiras, especially parts of the first movement of Bachianas No. 5. The middle section features a fugato on a subject related to the cantilena (xang√¥) motive from the second movement. This passage is the first occurrence of the atonal, chromatic, legato style found often in Villa-Lobos's subsequent quartets . The finale is similar in structure to the first movement, consisting of three successive, contrasting sections and a recapitulation of the first, concluding with a short coda . Unlike the first movement, however (and unlike all of the composer's earlier quartets), there is a certain thematic kinship amongst the sections, with a recurrence of a falling-third figure and the use of pseudo-Indian motifs influenced by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's \\"American\\" Quartet .

It was first performed in London in 1947, but the exact date, place, and performers are not known. The first performance in the composer's native country took place at the Audit√≥rio do MEC in Rio de Janeiro on 25 April 1960, as part of the Festival Villa-Lobos.

Analysis The quartet consists of four movements: #Allegro #Andantino vagaroso #Allegro poco moderato (con bravura) #Molto allegro The first movement is cast in the traditional sonata-allegro form, with a particularly strong influence from Joseph Haydn. This is seen especially in the use of mirroring that recalls the al rovescio counterpoint of the fugue in Haydn's Op. 20, No. 2 . The second theme group contains four subjects, the second of which uses the octatonic scale, suggesting the possible influence of Stravinsky . The second movement, on the other hand, shows remarkable similarities to Alban Berg's Lyric Suite and to B√©la Bart√≥k's Sixth Quartet .

A performance lasts approximately twenty-two minutes. History Villa-Lobos began composing his Twelfth Quartet in New York in 1950, during a stay in Memorial Hospital following kidney surgery, completing the score at the Hotel Weston on 15 September . According to the catalogue published by the Museu Villa-Lobos, it was first performed by the Quarteto Haydn in the Audit√≥rio do MEC, Rio de Janeiro, on 3 November 1951 . According to another authority, the first performance was given that same year by the S√£o Paulo Quartet . The score is dedicated to Mindinha (Arminda Neves d'Almeida), the composer's companion for the last 23 years of his life. Analysis As in all of Villa-Lobos's string quartets except the first, there are the traditional four movements: #Allegro #Andante malinconico #Allegretto leggiero #Allegro ben ritmato Departing from the traditional sonata-allegro form, Villa-Lobos casts the opening movement of this quartet in a simple ABA ternary form. Each section is thirty-two bars in length, subdivided into sixteen- , eight- , and four-bars segments, and this main body of the movement is followed by a sixteen-bar coda. An interesting detail of the manuscript score is that Villa-Lobos uses the Portuguese tempo marking Alegro, instead of the Italian spelling which is his normal habit . The middle, B section is marked meno, and is in the rhythm of a modinha . The composer's biographer, Eero Tarasti, regards this as a regression to Villa- Lobos's earlier, clumsier style of quartet writing, and finds the texture \\"considerably more complicated than in previous quartets and the sound lacks transparency\\" . Juan Jos√© Guti√©rrez, on the contrary, views the quartet as relatively simple and concise, marking the beginnings of a neoclassical concern with balance and symmetry of structure in the composer's late period . Like the opening movement's central section, the second, slow movement has the character of a modinha. Like the first movement, it is also in an ABA ternary form, in this case preceded by a thirty-two-bar introduction . The third movement is a scherzo (explicitly marked as such in the manuscript, but not in the printed score) . At rehearsal-number five the cello introduces a quotation from Villa-Lobos's 1940 cantata Mand√∫-√á√°r√°r√°, played in parallel fifths . The finale is once again a ternary ABA form, with a twenty-one bar coda . The composer described one theme from this movement as being \\"√† la Spanish\\" .

Both sources agree the year of composition was 1951 and that the score is dedicated to the Quarteto Municipal de S√£o Paulo. Analysis Like most of Villa-Lobos's works in the medium, the quartet consists of four movements: #Allegro non troppo #Scherzo (Vivace) #Adagio #Allegro vivace All four movements of this quartet are in ternary, ABA form . In the first movement, the return of the A section is restricted to its first half, the remainder being replaced with a ten-bar coda . The second movement is a scherzo, concluding with a coda made from material taken from the central, B section . The third, slow movement exhibits subtle features of modinha rhythms in 6/4 time . The main theme of this movement has been criticised as \\"exceptionally shapeless\\" . The finale is very similar to the opening movement, and uses as its main theme a subject connected by its intervallic structure to that of the fugato that opens the first movement . Eero Tarasti finds this theme \\"surprisingly feeble\\" . Discography Chronological, in order of dates of recording. *Villa-Lobos: Quatuors a Cordes Nos. 12‚Äì13‚Äì14.

Although it was present as a station shell when the first phase of the line opened (as a 2-track, 2-platform station), it was opened almost a decade later on March 26, 2016. Structure The form of the platform is a two-sided four-line double-sum platform. If the 2nd or 3rd station inside is mainline, the 1st and 4th station outside is mainline, and if the direct train is overtaking, the general train is evacuated by handling passengers on the mainline. From the time of its opening, a two-sided, two- way counter platform structure was constructed in advance to prepare for the new station. However, as the plan was changed so that the sub-main line, which was originally planned to be installed at Cheongna International City station, was built at this station, the new station was constructed and used at a location slightly shifted toward Cheongna International City station.

A performance lasts approximately twenty minutes. History The Budapest Quartet, who premiered Villa-Lobos's Quartet No. 17 Villa-Lobos composed his Seventeenth Quartet in Rio de Janeiro in 1957. It was first performed by the Budapest String Quartet on 16 October 1959, at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., exactly one month before the composer's death. Villa-Lobos was too ill to attend . He had given a copy of the score to the violinist Mariuccia Iacovino in Paris, before returning to Rio, mortally ill. He repeatedly asked her to arrange a reading of it, but adverse circumstances prevented this, and he died without knowing the premiere had already taken place . Analysis The quartet consists of the traditional four movements: # Allegro non troppo # Lento # Scherzo (Allegro vivace) # Allegro vivace (con fuoco) The first movement is in ternary, ABA form, rather than the expected sonata-allegro form, and has a long concluding coda of thirty-seven measures . The second movement is also in ternary form and has the character of the improvised instrumental serenade called a choro . The third movement is a traditional scherzo with trio, followed by a concluding coda . The finale breaks with traditional forms, offering instead a succession of three unrelated sections, a transition, and a recapitulation of the first half of section one, and an extended coda .

Monestime was a pioneer of Haitian Creole radio broadcasting in South Florida. In 1978, Monestime co- established Express Publicite Radio on WMBM, the first Haitian radio show to be broadcast in South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area. Express Publicite Radio aired on WMBM (1490 AM) for thirty years. Monestime also established and launched Radio Collective Internationale on 99.1 FM, the first radio station to be owned and operated by Haitians and Haitian Americans. Monestime was born in Gona√Øves, Haiti, on April 6, 1931. He fled from Haiti to the United States in 1964 to escape the dictatorship of Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier. He settled to New York City. During the 1960s and 1970s, Monestime operated some of the first Haitian nightclubs in New York City, including The Flatbush Terrace, which was located in Brooklyn. In 1977, he and his wife, Elvire Monestime, moved from New York to Miami, Florida. He owned his driving school, Panorama Express Driving School, which he opened shortly after relocating to Miami. Monestime became a noted broadcaster and activist for the Haitian community in South Florida. He lobbied the U.S. federal government to grant legal resident status to undocumented Haitian immigrants. According to Gepsie Metellus, the executive director of Sant La, a Haitian Neighborhood Center in Miami, \\"He was always at the forefront of significant community issues, whether it was the Haitian boat crisis or making sure our government would grant status to Haitians to make a new life in the U.S...He represents a lasting and important legacy ‚Ä¶ and a model and example for us to emulate in how we move forward.\\" In 1978, Monestime partnered with two colleagues, Pierre Mendes Alcindor, a psychology student, and Ferdinand Fort√©, a newscaster, to create the Express Publicite Radio on WMBM 1490-AM. Express Publicite Radio, which aired on WMBM for more than thirty years, was the first Haitian Creole radio show in South Florida. The show celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2008. Carmelau Monestime died on January 16, 2016, at the age of 84. Monestime, who was predeceased by his wife, Elvire, was survived by his two sisters, four children, six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

Klostergade is an old street, situated in the Vesterbro neighborhood and its eastern section enters the smaller Latin Quarter. Klostergade is home to two listed buildings and the historic Our Lady's Priory. Klotergade is a typical medieval street; narrow and curvy. Many small shops, caf√©s and restaurants are situated here and the nearby square Klostertorv is popular with recreational activities and an important event venue.  History  Klostergade in 1905 The street has existed since at least the 1300s when it was known by the Latin phrase Apud fratres (Behind the convent). The name references Our Lady's Priory which is situated on the street and was established no later than 1240. In 1562 the street had become known as Bag Klosteret, the Danish equivalent of the original Latin phrase. The stream Borreb√¶kken ran through Klostergade to Studsgade where it united with a stream from Vennelystparken. Klostergade was constructed as an extension of the short street of Graven, running north of the priory and it originally terminated at Munkegade, where the road to Randers began. Until the 1800s, Klostergade was the north-most street in the city. Behind the gardens was the city wall and the \\"road behind the city\\" which is today N√∏rre All√©. The significance of Klostergade as a thoroughfare was diminished at an early time when a new road from Studsgade to Christiansbjerg was established in 1757 and most traffic from Randers went to the city gate in Studsgade. When N√∏rre All√© was widened and paved, even more traffic bypassed Klostergade. Initially the western section of Klostergade and the southern section of Gr√∏nnegade was known as Skidenstr√¶de (Lit.: Shit- alley). In 1830 Skidenstr√¶de became part of Gr√∏nnegade until 1909 when the southern section of Gr√∏nnegade was made a part of Klostergade.  Buildings  Klostergade gets its name from Our Lady's Priory which is situated on the street. The priory was established by the Dominican order some time in the 1220-30s on the site of the original St. Nicolas cathedral. The cathedral was torn down in stages and the priory built in its stead. Beneath the priory lies a crypt church from the cathedral which may be the oldest stone church in Scandinavia. Behind the priory on Vestergade lies the Church of Our Lady. Directly across the street from the priory is two listed buildings from 1685 and 1777. The 1685 complex is a half-timbered structure with a building facing the street, another wing behind it from the 1700s and a basement from the late Middle Ages. The other listing is a 3-winged estate with a renaissance building from 1812 facing the street and an older half-timbered house from 1777 behind it. Stardust Caf√©.JPGSeveral old listed buildings Vor Frue Kloster 4.jpgThe (former) priory attached to the Church of Our Lady has official address at Klostergade.Note: The public entry to the priory is in the church.

Restaurant Latin.jpgOne of several restaurants  Flora Inspired by an old chestnut tree in the priory gardens two rows of Aesculus hippocastanum chestnuts were planted around the parking area on Klostergade. On the square Klostertorv an Acer platanoides maple was planted around the turn of the 20th century in a courtyard. The buildings around it has since been torn down and the area turned into a large open square. In 1973 a small square on the corner of Badstuegade was established with 3 lime trees, Tilia cordata.

It was created in 1983, along with other protected areas, in part to mitigate the impact of the Karelskiy Okatysh mine outside of the town of Kostomuksha, one of the largest iron ore reserves in Russia, and also to protect the forest from increase commercial logging in the area. A further scientific purpose is the protection of forest reindeer and a type of landlocked salmon. The reserve is part of a transboundary reserve complex with reserves in Finland to the west (collectively called \\"Friendship\\"), and is situated in the Kalevalsky District and Muyezersky District of the Republic of Karelia, about 500 km north of St. Petersburg and 500 km west of Arkhangelsk. The reserve was created in 1993, and covers an area of . Topography The terrain is flat or low hills of forest and wetlands. The area is within the Baltic Shield, on the eastern slopes of the West Karelian Hills. A dominant feature of the reserve is Lake Kamennoye (\\"Stone Lake\\"), which covers 20% of the reserve. The lake is of a roughly elongated shape, 24 km long by 12 km wide, and on average about 8 meters deep; it has 98 lakes and an irregular coastline. Water from the lake flows out through the Kamennaya River, to the Kem River, and on to the White Sea. There an additional 250 lakes, and 12% of the reserve is marsh. Climate and Ecoregion Kostomuksha Nature Reserve, 2014, photo by Igor Georgievskiy Kostamuksha is located in the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion. Steppe with long \\"\\"ribbon forests\\"\\" of pine; about 300‚Äì500 miles more northerly than the European Russian forest. This ecoregion has more wetlands and more continental climate than the European forest steppe. The climate of Kostamuksha is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfc)). This climate is characterised by long cold winters, and short, cool summers. Kostomuksha is frost-free for an average 183 days per year. Flora and fauna The geology and relief of the reserve cause high bogs with ridge-hollow wetland complexes, and the associated floral communities. The forests are mostly pine, with some spruce, birch and aspen. Underneath the sparse pine cover is moss, cranberry and blueberry. Herbaceous plants are not common. The animals of the reserve are those typical of the northern boreal forest: bear, wolf, elk, lynx, wolverine, rabbit, squirrel, marten, ermine, weasel. Beavers were introduced from Canada, and are a protected species in the reserve. Because of the clean water in rivers and lakes, the reserve supports a diverse bird community - over 130 species have been reported, with more than 100 nesting. Of nesting birds, 3 species are Arctic avifauna, 34 are northern Siberian, 19 are typical of European deciduous forests, and the remainder are widespread. Fish in the rivers include pike, whitefish, perch, roach, grayling and lake salmon. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Kostamucksha Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are however, six 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve that are open to the public, but require permits to be obtained in advance. Three of the routes are hiking trails, and three are water routes. The main office is in the city of Kostomuksha.

Some of them followed the philosophers but they did only what they thought their people wanted. The people themselves had little choice in the matter. Most were directly linked to the Enlightenment period in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Characteristics Enlightened despots were monarchs who distinguished themselves from despots (in the ordinary sense) by the way they governed; they claimed to rule for the well-being of their subjects. For example, an enlightened despot may focus government priorities on matters of public importance such as healthcare, education, nonviolent population control, or physical infrastructure. He or she may be committed to peaceful relations and may even allow for some democratic decision-making to exist, such as public referendums, but did not propose reforms that would undermine their sovereignty or disrupt social order. As John Stuart Mill articulated: \\"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement.\\" Although their reigns were based upon Enlightenment principles, their beliefs about royal power were similar to those of regular despots. Enlightened despots believed that they were destined to be ruler the moment they were born. Enlightened rulers may have played a part in the abolition of serfdom in Europe.

In recent history dictators such as Porfirio Diaz, Lee Kuan Yew, Josip Broz Tito, Ant√≥nio Salazar, Isaias Afwerki, Park Chung-hee, Chiang Kai-shek, Pervez Musharraf, Thomas Sankara, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, and Muammar Gaddafi have been characterized as enlightened despots. In all of these cases the point of view as to just how \\"enlightened\\" or \\"dictatorial\\" they are is largely subjective. Generally, dictators who serve in office for a very long period are more likely to be regarded as enlightened because they will often be forced to pay some attention to the public interest in order to remain in power and, more importantly, to be regarded as legitimate. Dictators who hold office for a brief period of time or are simply members of a rotating dictatorial elite (such as those heading some juntas) may have less charismatic authority and prove to be forgettable and are therefore often easier to demonize.

In 1990, the City of Myrtle Creek acquired timbers from the former Horse Creek Bridge in Lane County and used them to build a covered bridge over Myrtle Creek. The bridge connects a parking area to the city's Mill Site Park. North fork North Myrtle Creek begins in the Cascade Range at on the slopes of Buck Peak, and it flows generally southwest. The named tributaries of North Myrtle Creek from source to mouth are Buck Fork followed by Lee, Slide, Frozen, Big Lick, Little Lick, and Bilger creeks. =China Ditch= Gold had been discovered in Douglas County as early as the 1860s. In 1891, China Ditch, a artificial waterway dug with the help of hundreds of Chinese workers, began diverting water from Little River in the North Umpqua River basin to North Myrtle Creek to make hydraulic dredging with large machines possible near the headwaters during all seasons . By 1894, the project had failed to produce enough gold to meet expenses and closed down. The Bureau of Land Management oversees an segment of the ditch that has been preserved. A loop formed by existing county roads‚Äîsupplemented by a trail‚Äîallows visitors to see remnants of the ditch by automobile. The self-guided loop includes a series of signs detailing the history of the ditch. South fork South Myrtle Creek begins at near Deadman Mountain in the Umpqua National Forest of the Cascade Range, and it flows generally west-southwest. The named tributaries of South Myrtle Creek from source to mouth are Curtin, Johnson, Lally, Weaver, Letitia, Long Wiley, Short Wiley, and Louis creeks, followed by Ben Branch, School Hollow, and Cedar Hollow. Neal Lane Bridge, a covered bridge, carries Neal Lane over the creek near the city of Myrtle Creek. The span is the only covered bridge in Oregon with a kingpost truss design.

History The Colorado Trail was conceived in 1973 by the Roundup Riders of the Rockies, but not connected end-to-end until 1987. The Colorado Trail Foundation (CTF) evolved out of cooperative efforts by the United States Forest Service, the Colorado Mountain Trails Foundation, and individual volunteers from the Colorado Mountain Club and the Friends of the Colorado Trail. In 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the CTF and Forest Service, detailing their respective roles in the future development of the trail. Activities Assisted by 600 volunteers and 3,000 donors each year, the CTF maintains over 500 miles of trail. Each summer, its trail crews work for about 12 weeks and six weekends clearing trees, working on erosion controls, and maintaining signage along the trail. The trail crews work on major projects that are beyond the scope of its sister \\"Adopt-A-Trail\\" program. That program lets interested volunteers \\"adopt\\" one of 78 maintenance sections along the trail, each averaging about eight miles long. Every summer, the CTF offers week-long supported treks on the Trail, providing hikers with guides and the services of the trekking staff. The Foundation maintains an extensive web site with information about the trail, and publishes a series of books and trail guides for hikers. Governance The CTF is governed by a twelve-person board. There is a full-time Executive Director and one administrative staff member. Its total revenues in 2013 were just over $400,000.

She maintained a detailed card index of all soldiers from Central Queensland so that mail and parcels from their families could reach them and she provided practical and financial assistance to soldiers who were wounded, on leave in England or needing assistance with the army's bureaucracy. She was nicknamed \\"Mother of the Queenslanders\\" and \\"Mother of Anzacs\\".  Early life  Annie Margaret Laurie was born on 10 December 1867 at Saunders Station, Dingo, Queensland, the eldest surviving child of grazier Alexander Stuart Somerville Laurie and his wife Margaret (n√©e Stevenson). She attended Springsure State School. She was educated in a Rockhampton convent school and received some nursing training at Sydney Hospital after which she worked as a private nurse in Rockhampton. On 24 February 1896, she married Henry Gaudiano Wheeler of Cooroorah Station, near Blackwater, at St Paul's Cathedral in Rockhampton. Their daughter, Portia Jean, was born in 1897, but her husband died in 1903. Following his death, she returned to Rockhampton where she took over the Criterion Hotel. In March 1913, she went to England to visit relations and to complete Portia's education.  World War I  A hero's welcome for Annie Wheeler on her return to Rockhampton, November 1919 At the outset of World War I, she took up residence in London, near the Australian Army Headquarters and the Anzac Buffet. From this base, Mrs Wheeler endeavoured to contact all soldiers from Central Queensland, whether they were wounded, imprisoned, or in the trenches. She kept a detailed card index on them, corresponded with servicemen on the battlefield, forwarded packages and mail, provided for their needs and supervised the care and comfort of those in hospital. For soldiers on furlough, she supplemented restricted allowances and advanced funds when they experienced bureaucratic delays. To them, she became known as the \\"Mother of the Queenslanders\\". Families in Queensland sent letters and parcels through her; this was the only mail many diggers received. By 1918 over 2300 men were on her books. One of those she assisted was Jack Fryer who wrote to his sister saying: > \\"Went to see Mrs Wheeler this morning. She was jolly glad to see some of us > Rockhampton boys. By jove! She is a great little woman. I think the name > 'Mother of Anzacs' suits her to a T.\\" Annie Wheeler's support for families back in Queensland is illustrated by Jack Fryer being wounded by a grenade in early August 1918. Annie Wheeler sent a telegram to his family on 15 August saying \\"Jack writes hospital France wounds improving\\", which arrived 6 days before the official army telegram stating \\"Now reported Lieut. John Fryer admitted 6 August Second British Red Cross Hospital, England. Multiple gunshot wounds. Severe.\\" Each fortnight Mrs Wheeler sent home detailed letters which were published in The Capricornian and The Morning Bulletin. Initially she provided financial assistance from her own resources, but later a special fund to support her work was established at Rockhampton. Early in 1918, when she experienced poor health, Nurse May MacDonald was sent from Rockhampton to assist her.  After the war  Arrival of Mrs Wheeler to unveil the Springsure School War Memorial Fountain, 1919The Australian Government provided a free passage for Annie Wheeler's return in November 1919. Rockhampton accorded her a hero's welcome; over 5000 people met her train and cheering soldiers towed her car through the streets to a public reception with further functions in other towns. On 6 December 1919, Annie Wheeler returned to Springsure State School to unveil the memorial fountain honouring the former pupils of the school who served in the war. The list included Mrs Wheeler and Nurse Squires. M.M. Kavanaugh, the chairman of Bauhinia Shire, presented Mrs Wheeler with an electroplated tea and coffee service for her untiring work for the soldiers of their district. Jack Fryer formed part of the honour guard at the unveiling.Unveiling the War Memorial fountain in Springsure State School, 6 December 1919On 19 October 1920, Annie Wheeler was awarded an O.B.E. for \\"comforts and entertainments for the troops\\".  Later life  Annie Wheeler died in Brisbane on 23 October 1950 and was cremated at Mt Thompson Crematorium on 25 October 1950. Her memorial at the crematorium has the words \\" She lived not unto herself\\".  Legacy  The State Library of Queensland holds Annie Wheeler's index of several thousand cards, shedding light on the details of Queensland's World War I servicemen.

He was created by Jack Kirby, and debuted in Showcase #6 (Feb 1957). In 1967, the character was killed in a story called \\"Taps for Red\\" (Showcase #55, April 1967). However, the death was undone after six issues. Fictional character biography An accomplished stunt man and daredevil performer, Red Ryan is known for his athletic ability and fearless attitude towards extreme sport. He was scheduled to appear on a radio program with pilot Ace Morgan, scientist Walter \\"Prof\\" Haley, and boxer Rocky Davis. After their plane crashes in the Rocky Mountains, the four men emerge from the wreckage alive and unscathed. Deciding to band together, they form the Challengers of the Unknown and embark on a career of adventuring and exploration. During one of their adventures, Red appears to be killed off, and his younger brother, pop star Marty \\"Tino Manarry\\" Ryan, joins the team in his absence. However, Red soon returns to the team, and Marty leaves after receiving injuries that render him blind. Years later, a middle-aged Red is still affiliated with the Challengers and living in Challenger Mountain. When Multi-Man sabotages the team's generator, the resulting explosion destroys their base and the nearby town, killing thousands of people. Although Prof and June are supposedly deceased, Red, Ace and Rocky survive the blast and are charged with criminal negligence. Despite being found not guilty, they are ordered to disband as a team. Following the split, Red becomes a vigilante mercenary. His activities take him to Gotham City, where he is dissuaded by Batman to leave. Later, he rejoins Ace and Rocky to reform the Challengers. Alternate versions *Red Ryan appears prominently with the rest of the Challengers in Darwyn Cooke's miniseries DC: The New Frontier. This version of the character is portrayed as a James Dean-type rebel who struggles with the near-fatal plane crash. Unable to get the memory out of his mind, he goes to the crash site and meets up with Morgan, Haley and Davis, who resolve to seek adventure and explore the mysterious. They participate in the attempted space rescue of Rick Flag and the defence against The Centre. *As part of The New 52's DC Comics Presents, Red is one of eight people scheduled to appear on a reality show. In other media *In the 2008 Justice League: The New Frontier film, Red Ryan briefly appears in a nonspeaking cameo role during the third act. *Ryan appears in an episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Ioan Gruffudd.

In addition to developing a consumer led, proactive policy and advocacy agenda, the organisation participates in government consultations and prepare submissions to government agencies on a range of issues affecting people with arthritis. Programs and projects Arthritis Australia develops and supports several programs and projects that: * provide support and information to people with arthritis as well as their families and friends * promote awareness of the challenges facing people with arthritis across the community, and to leaders in business, industry, and government * fund research into potential causes and possible cures as well as better ways to live with arthritis, and/or * aim to keep health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and community nurses informed. Major activities =MyJointPain.org.au= In 2012, Arthritis Australia partnered with the Bupa Health Foundation to create MyJointPain.org.au.MyJointPain.org.au The website creates a tailored management plan for people living with chronic joint pain from osteoarthritis and provides comprehensive information to help them manage their condition and improve their mobility. The website has four major functions: * Screening ‚Äì an assessment tool to determine the likelihood of osteoarthritis in the hip, knee or hand; * Management plan ‚Äì a summary of evidence-based treatment options for each user's circumstances; * Tracking ‚Äì weekly check ups allow a user to track their progress over time; * Support ‚Äì website users can create an action plan and get further help for each task. =Frustration with packaging ‚Äì Ease of Use= Arthritis Australia established the Ease of Use program to help industries fix issues with hard-to-open packaging. The scheme has tested more than 200 products, including products from Nestl√©, Woolworths, Kellogg's and SPC Ardmona. Packaging accessibility has become an issue due to two trends: an ageing population with reduced strength and functional limitations, and an increase in \\"packaging rage\\" or \\"wrap rage\\" ‚Äì the coined terms for the anger consumers feel when they can‚Äôt open packaging. Data from a 2013 Catalyst Research survey showed that one in two Australians have injured themselves opening packaging. Of those, 42% of people suffered a deep cut they treated at home when trying to open packaging. To assist the packaging industry with these trends, Arthritis Australia developed a variety of tests to assist retailers and manufacturers. One of these tests, the Initial Scientific Review (ISR), was developed as part of a consortium that included Nestl√©, NSW Health and Georgia Tech. The ISR report evaluates packaging for ease of opening and accessibility, as well as providing a score based on the Accessibility Benchmarking Scale (ABS). The ABS score estimates the percentage of the population that can open the packaging and allows organisations to compare suppliers. For hospitals, the ISR allows them to work with manufacturers to make modifications to packaging as recommended on the ISR and improve packaging accessibility for hospital patients.https://www.hpv.org.au/news- centre/news-updates/victorian-and-nsw-public-hospitals-mandate-packaging- accessibility-guidelines/ Research Arthritis Australia strives to further the knowledge of arthritis and to search for cures. Much of Australia Arthritis‚Äôs work is directed toward raising funds to provide grants, fellowships and scholarships. Arthritis Australia awards nearly $1 million in annual funding to researchers engaged in basic and clinical research that aims to further knowledge of arthritis and develop treatments and cures. Grant recipients are mostly early or mid-career scientists and clinicians. One-year fellowships, project grants and scholarships are also offered. Orthopaedic fellowships In keeping with its mission of promoting medical education, Arthritis Australia conducts the Arthritis Australia/Zimmer Biomet Orthopaedic Fellowship Program. The program, supported by Zimmer Biomet Pty Ltd, promotes best practice orthopaedic surgery and is available to Australian and New Zealand institutions and practitioners. Funding Arthritis Australia relies on community groups, individuals, corporate sponsors and the Australian government for most of its funding. Board of directors The voluntary board of directors of Arthritis Australia is made up of corporate, health and community representatives who are committed to: * developing further initiatives for assisting Australians with arthritis * restricting the rate of growth of arthritis in Australia * ensuring arthritis is on the national agenda, and * advocating world class research into the disease History Arthritis Australia, originally named the Australian Rheumatism Council, held its inaugural meeting on 25 May 1949. Its objectives were to: * Institute research into causes and means of alleviation of any form of rheumatic condition * To establish special facilities for the treatment of rheumatic conditions * To endow chairs at appropriate university medical schools * To communicate knowledge as to the methods of prevention, alleviation and cure of rheumatic conditions. In 1968 the name was changed to Australian Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation and in 1984 the foundation incorporated in New South Wales and became the Arthritis Foundation of Australia. From 1948 through the 1950s, individual physicians who were interested in the management of rheumatic conditions were at disadvantage as there were few facilities at the teaching hospitals. There was also widespread ignorance among the general public as to what could be done for people with arthritis. In 1960 the foundation received a bequest that made it possible for funds to be directed towards facilitating the training of young physicians in the special skills required to treat people with arthritis. From 1967 to 1982, each state developed an independent arthritis organisation with aims focused on the treatment and rehabilitation facilities in each state. Each state/territory offices operates as an autonomous organisation and all state and territory offices except for Arthritis Victoria are affiliated with Arthritis Australia. Today, the Arthritis Australia state affiliates focus on education for health consumers and health professionals, support the National Arthritis Infoline, distribute information sheets and booklets and run community seminars. Similar organizations * Arthritis Foundation ‚Äì USA * Arthritis Research UK ‚Äì UK * Arthritis Care ‚Äì UK * The Swedish Rheumatism Association ‚Äì Sweden * The Arthritis Society ‚Äì Canada * Arthritis New Zealand About arthritis Arthritis is an umbrella term for more than 100 medical conditions that affect the musculoskeletal system, specifically joints where two or more bones meet. The three most significant ‚Äì osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout ‚Äì account for more than 95 per cent of cases in Australia. The most common forms of arthritis are: * Osteoarthritis is a condition that affects the whole joint including bone, cartilage, ligaments and muscles. It may include inflammation, damage to joint cartilage, bony spurs or deterioration of the ligaments. * Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes pain and swelling of the joints. The normal role of the body‚Äôs immune system is to fight off infections to keep the body healthy. In an autoimmune disease, your immune system starts attacking your own healthy tissues. In RA, the immune system targets the lining of the joints, causing inflammation and joint damage. However larger joints such as the hips and knees can also be affected. * Gout is a condition in which small crystals form in and around the joint, causing inflammation, pain and swelling. These crystals are made of one of the body‚Äôs normal waste products, uric acid. Normally the body rids itself of extra uric acid through the kidneys into the urine. However this does not happen fast enough in people with gout. This causes uric acid levels to build up and the crystals to form. * Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a condition that mainly affects the spine. The joints of the neck, back and pelvis become inflamed, causing pain and stiffness. The sacroiliac joints are commonly affected in AS. These joints connect the base of your spine (sacrum) to your pelvis. Other joints, such as the hips and shoulders, can also be involved. AS can also affect other parts of the body, such as the eyes, skin, bowel and lungs. The symptoms of AS usually begin between the ages of 15 and 45 years. * Juvenile arthritis includes all types of arthritis that affect people less than 16 years of age. As with adult arthritis, there are different types of juvenile arthritis. It usually takes an arthritis specialist ‚Äì a rheumatologist ‚Äì to diagnose this medical condition. * Systemic lupus erythematosus (also called SLE or lupus) is an autoimmune condition. The normal role of the body‚Äôs immune system is to fight off infections and diseases to keep you healthy. In an autoimmune disease like lupus, your immune system starts attacking one's own healthy tissues. For some people lupus may just affect the skin or joints. In other people the lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, brain or other parts of the body may also be affected. * Scleroderma ‚Äì The word scleroderma means \\"hard skin\\". Scleroderma affects the connective tissues of the body (tissues that hold together joints, muscles, blood vessels and internal organs). The connective tissues of people with scleroderma have too much of a protein called collagen. Collagen is important to give connective tissue its strength, but excess collagen causes hardening and tightening of the affected area. Arthritis-related problems include pain, stiffness, inflammation and damage to joint cartilage (the tissue that covers the ends of bones, enabling them to move against each another) and surrounding structures. This can result in joint weakness, instability and deformities that can interfere with the most basic daily tasks such as walking, driving a car and preparing food. Arthritis is not yet curable. While the condition is usually manageable, it invariably impacts on a person‚Äôs quality of life and includes varying degrees of discomfort and pain.

Kanyaka Station, a prominent pastoral holding in the region, was taken up in 1852 by Hugh Proby. It became one of the largest stations in the area, reportedly employing up to seventy families at one stage. In 1856, the station owner built an eating house on the main road to divert visitors away from the main station. A government town of Kanyaka along the main road was surveyed in 1863, although not proclaimed; although the Kanyaka township itself would be a failure and the least successful of the four former towns in the modern-day locality, it allowed for the construction of a two-story hotel, the Great Northern Hotel, on the main road in 1865. Kanyaka Post Office had opened on 6 October 1858, and a general store would operate alongside it in the 1860s. The Hundred of Kanyaka was gazetted on 6 July 1876 by Governor Anthony Musgrave; it was noted that the Kanyaka name reportedly stemmed from an Aboriginal name for a local waterhole. The Hundred of Kanyaka and the northern section of the adjacent Hundred of Cudlamunda roughly correlates to the boundaries of the modern-day Kanyaka locality. The District Council of Kanyaka was created in 1888 to represent the area of the station and cadastral hundred; its council seat, however, would lie outside its boundaries in the town of Quorn. The modern locality of Kanyaka was established in 1999, when boundaries were formalised and named after the former Kanyaka Station in respect of the long-established local name. The modern locality also subsumed four former government towns: Kanyaka, Gordon, Simmonston, and Wilson, as well as their surrounding pastoral lands. Of the four former towns now in the Kanyaka locality, three were located along the modern Flinders Ranges Way. Kanyaka township itself had been the smallest; it had been surveyed in 1863 but not proclaimed and was entirely based along the main road. Wilson, further to the north along the same road, was a larger village with around eleven blocks on either side of the main road. It was surveyed in November 1880, and named after Charles Wilson, a \\"brother officer\\" of Governor William Jervois. Wilson had a railway station on the Central Australia Railway line, which had been previously known as the Palmer siding, and closed when the local railway was re-routed through Parachilna. The former Kanyaka Post Office was renamed the Wilson Post Office on 28 February 1881. Gordon, located along the road to the south, on the edge of the modern border with Willochra was another village of several blocks, named on 2 October 1879 by Governor Jervois, reportedly after one of his brothers; it also contained its own railway station. The fourth town, Simmonston was located in the west of the locality; it is recorded as having been gazetted in 1876 but named in 1880. Today, the ruins of the Kanyaka Station complex including the nearby woolshed and cemetery, and the stone walling on the opposite side of the Hawker road, are located on the South Australian Heritage Register.

After being initially repulsed by Norwegian naval units, German troops headed overland to outflank the base, forcing it to capitulate.  Background  Karljohansvern, 25 miles up the Oslofjord, had been Norway's main naval base since 1819. On the morning of 9 April two operational ships were in the harbour: the minelayer (present for repairs) and the minesweeper . Approximately 40 percent of their crews were on shore leave at the time. Also present at the base were the dilapidated coastal defence ships and which, being unarmed, decommissioned training and depot vessels, took no part in the fighting. The commanding officer at the base was Admiral J. Smith-Johansen. Shortly after midnight Admiral Smith-Johansen informed the captain of Olav Tryggvason, T. Briseid, that there had been a battle at the mouth of the Oslofjord, and it was likely that the enemy ships had breached the outer fortifications. Briseid was given orders to open fire on any hostile ships. Smith-Johansen shared his intentions to send Rauma and out to sweep the fjord. Briseid dispatched one of his ship's motor boats to Langgrunn where it told the merchant ships at anchor to extinguish their lights.Forsvarets museer. Olav Tryggvason kampene i Horten (in Norwegian) The German forces allotted to attack Horten were from Kampfgruppe 5. This consisted of the torpedo boats and under the command of Siegfried Strelow and H. Wilcke respectively. They were accompanied by the motor minesweepers R17 and R21, heavily laden with troops from the light cruiser . Admiral Oskar Kummetz ordered the ships at 03:30 to detach from the main force and secure Horten. Battle The detached force arrived at the mouth of the harbour at 05:35. The R boats proceeded to make their landings while the torpedo boats held back. Olav Tryggvason, which had been guarding the entrance since 03:15, initially let the vessels pass. The crew soon realized its error and opened fire. The minesweeper R17 was struck just as it pulled alongside the quay, sinking in the shallow water. The ship's depth charges detonated at 06:15, causing further casualties. Rauma returned and began dueling with R21. Rauma was damaged and its gun crew was wounded, so the ship retreated to the naval base for medical assistance. Two sailors were killed.Forsvarets museer. Rauma (1) (in Norwegian) R21, also damaged, disengaged. At 07:30 Albatros tried to directly intervene by heading into the harbour. The boat's course was constricted by the narrow channel it was using, and soon began taking fire from Olav Tryggvason. The Albatros responded with its forward battery, but it jammed after eight rounds and the damaged ship was forced to retreat. At 08:00 Emden moved over to support the Germans at Horten, sending around 50 soldiers ashore to attack over the land. Captain Grundmann of R17, seeking to establish communication with the Norwegian naval staff, managed to contact Admiral Smith-Johansen. Bluffing, he declared that a large German force had seized the town of Horten and that it would be bombarded if the admiral did not surrender within half an hour. Smith-Johansen surrendered Karljohansvern at 08:35.  Aftermath  With Karljohansvern now subdued, the Germans could focus on taking the forts at the mouth of the Oslofjord. transferred its soldiers to R21 so it could provide gunfire support for an assault on Bol√¶rne. That afternoon the ship attacked, but was driven off by 10 rounds from the fort's 5.9 inch guns. While maneuvering in the fog to avoid being hit the ship ran aground, becoming a total loss. The Germans seized a number of ships at Karljohansvern and pressed them into service. Olav Tryggvason was renamed Brummer; Rauma became Kamerun; and Tordenskjold and Harald Haarfagre were transformed into AA batteries as Nymphe and Thetis, respectively. Present at the nearby dockyards were the torpedo boats √òrn and Lom, commissioned by the Germans as Schlange and Eidechse, respectively. The incomplete torpedo boat Balden was finished by the Germans and commissioned as Leopard. The crane vessel Marinens Flytekran was also seized.

Most of the surrounding farmers have dry land rain-fed fields averaging 2.5 hectares. Livestock of these farmer also benefit by foraging at the adjacent bush that is evergreen watered by spillage irrigation water. Management The scheme was developed by Agritex, an extensition-work department of the Ministry of Agriculture. It is managed by the scheme management committee elected by participating farmers from among their members. Maintenance is carried out by civil servants at the scheme in unison with the management committee, Agritex officers and plot holders. =Women= Women have 50% representation in the management committee yet the percentage of work by women is only 33\\\\.

Irrigation Seasons July‚ÄìFebruary is maize corn season. March‚ÄìJune is the Beans and Tomato season. Yields Normally yields are 7000 kg corn (sold as green maize) per hectare and more than 1000 kg/ha for beans. At the market prices of $0.43/kg for green maize and $1.50/kg for beans, the two crops have a value of $3000/ha for maize and $1500/ha for beans, giving a combined harvest value of $4500/ha per year. The values quoted above are based on the following; 700 kg per comma (per 0,1ha). Green maize is usually sold in dozens and a dozen has an average of 7 kg. With this assumption 1 comma would sell for US$300 at US$3 per dozen. 1000 kg/ha to 1200 kg/ha beans. That is 100 kg to 120 kg per comma of beans. Beans usually sell at US$1.50 per kg.

History =Foundation= On 29 May 1867, a mission started in the town to serve the local Roman Catholic population. It was in 42 Ceylon Place in the town. The first priest was Fr Charles P. King. In less than a year after the mission began, Fr King paid for a chapel, made of brick, to be built on Junction Road. On 1 April 1869, it was opened. It was dedicated to Stella Maris.Eastbourne - Our Lady of Ransom from English Heritage, retrieved 16 February 2016 On 14 April 1890, the old Our Lady of Ransom Church was opened by Fr Charles Stapley. It was a temporary church close to Grove Road. It was previously the market hall and it became a garage for the police station. For the next ten years attempts were made to build a permanent church in the town. In February 1893, Fr King left Eastbourne. On 23 September 1895, St Joseph's Catholic School was opened. =Construction= Before 1900, the site of the present church was bought. On 11 December 1900, the foundation stone of the church was laid.

On 15 December 1901, the church was opened by the Bishop of Southwark, Francis Bourne, who went on to become a cardinal and Archbishop of Westminster. In 1903, the church was completed, with the exception of the tower. By that time, the priest of the church was Fr Paul Lynch. In 1912, the church's tower and spire were completed. On 11 February 1926, various church extensions, such as the chancel, lady chapel and sacristy, were completed and the church was reopened. On 8 July 1926, the church was consecrated.

Virgil used several characteristics associated with epic poetry, more specifically Homer's epics, including the use of hexameter verse, book division, lists of genealogies and underlying themes to draw parallels between the Romans and their cultural predecessors, the Greeks. Similarities to the Iliad The second half of the Aeneid, Books VI through XII, follow similarly to what happens throughout the Iliad. =Absences of the Heroes= Book VI of the Aeneid reveals a prophecy for Aeneas by the Sibyl of Cumae stating that a Latin-born Achilles, who is also the son of a goddess (Aeneid, Book VI, lines 89‚Äì90), exists. There are many scholarly debates on who this Latin-born Achilles is, whether he is Aeneas, Turnus, or some other character, and if so, is the opponent symbolic of another character from the Iliad? If comparing Aeneas to Achilles and Turnus to Hector, several parallels can be drawn. One example is when Aeneas is absent from the battlefield, Turnus lays waste to the Trojan army, just as Hector did to the Greek army in the absence of Achilles. Just as Hector kills Patroclus, Turnus slaughters Pallas, and to avenge the deaths of their friends, both Achilles and Aeneas slay their opponents. =Prophecies= Prophecies contribute a large theme among epics, especially that of the Iliad, the Odyssey and the Aeneid. From the beginning of the Iliad, readers knew that the Greeks were fated to triumph over the Trojans, as was declared by the king of the gods, Zeus. Achilles' fate was also foretold; if he went to war he would die a hero. Similarly, Aeneas was told by the ghost of Hector in Book II that he was to leave burning Troy to found a new city. Throughout the rest of the epic, the gods include reminders that Aeneas is destined to find Italy and found Rome for future generations. =Ekphrasis= Another thing Virgil replicates from the Iliad is the ekphrasis of Aeneas' shield. In Book VIII of the Aeneid, Vulcan (the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Hephaestus) forges a shield for Aeneas before he goes into battle. This is similar to Hephaestus creating Achilles' shield in Book XVII of the Iliad. Both of the goddesses who mothered the heroes (Venus and Thetis) feared for the safety of their sons preceding war, so both went to Vulcan/Hephaestus asking for him to create armor and a shield for Aeneas and Achilles. Upon the finish of the god of fire's creations, the poets soon followed with a detailed description of the shields, an ekphrasis. The ekphrasis of the shield of Achilles depicts everything that the world currently consisted of, as well as opposites, such as war and peace, heaven and earth, etc. The ekphrasis of Aeneas' shield depicts Rome's greatest glories that are to come, such as the founder of Rome, Romulus, with his twin brother Remus with the she-wolf that cared for the twins, and Augustus' victory at the Battle of Actium. Similarities to the Odyssey The first half of the Aeneid mimics the journey of Odysseus in several ways. Though the Odyssey takes course over the span of 24 books while the Aeneid replicates the happenings in the Odyssey in 6 books, there are several comparisons to make. =The Characters= Odysseus and Aeneas are both royalty, Odysseus being the king of Ithaca and Aeneas a Trojan prince. Without the help of divine intervention though, neither hero would have met his destiny, though there were opposing gods who wanted to delay and provide hardship for the heroes along the journey. Odysseus‚Äô antagonist was Poseidon, the god of the sea, whom he angered by blinding Poseidon's son Polyphemus. In doing this, Poseidon's wrath was given every chance possible, especially with storms blowing the Greek ships off course, even destroying them. Hera was the goddess who used everything in her power to delay Aeneas from ever fulfilling his prophecy since Aeneas was a Trojan, and Hera had a hatred for the Trojans ever since the Trojan prince Paris gave a golden apple to Aphrodite, stating that she was the most beautiful out of her, Athena and Hera. Storms caused by Hera also blow the Trojan fleet about and off course, which ultimately lands them at Carthage (leading to another reason for Hera to despise Aeneas and the Trojans). =Stories within a Story= The concept of a character narrating a story within the current story, providing subsequent layers, is seen in both the Aeneid and the Odyssey, more specifically the story of the heroes' journey up until that point in time, since both epics start in medias res, in the middle of things. With the story of Odysseus, the Greek washes up on the shores of Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who hospitably take Odysseus in and ask him how he has come to their land. Odysseus spends Books IX through XII recounting his journey from Troy to where he was presently. In Aeneas' case, upon arrival in Carthage, Dido asked Aeneas to share his story, so Books II and III were narrating the fall of Troy and how Aeneas and his people arrived at Carthage. =The Journey= Both heroes sail over the same sea, sometimes visiting the same locations and experiencing the same difficulties. In Book III of the Aeneid, Aeneas and his men come close to Scylla and Charybdis, as Odysseus and his men do in Book XII of the Odyssey, followed by the Trojans landing on the island of the Cyclopes, as Aeneas does in Book III. Aeneas' crew had the fortune of not having the same fate as some in Odysseus' crew. Virgil also included an emaciated Greek named Achaemenides, who had sailed with Odysseus but had been left behind. The two heroes also make a katabasis into the Underworld to retrieve information from the deceased. =The Homecoming= Upon arrival in Ithaca, Odysseus is met with suitors who are in his home, destroying it, and trying to win the hand of his wife, Penelope. Odysseus proceeds to fight off these suitors, killing them so he can have his home back. Similarly, Aeneas is supposed to found his home in Latium and marry the princess Lavinia, where he is met with the army of Turnus, who was the king of Rutuli and Lavinia's leading suitor before Aeneas came along. Aeneas has to engage in a battle before he can finally rest in his newfound home.
