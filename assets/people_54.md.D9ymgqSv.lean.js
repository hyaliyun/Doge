Her early career in New York state and Pennsylvania focused on portraits. After moving to Bordentown, New Jersey, she specialized in paintings of animals as well as an occasional still life and other subjects.  Early years  The Lincoln Children, 1845. Waters was born in Binghamton, New York, the daughter of Lark Moore (a cooper) and his wife, Sally. A self- taught artist with little formal training, she attended Friendsville Boarding School in Friendsville, Pennsylvania, where she paid tuition for her sister and herself by \\"painting copies for the course in Natural History\\".  Personal life  On June 27, 1841, at age 17, she married William C. Waters, whose Quaker connections determined the destinations of their frequent relocations. William, who had health problems, was unable to contribute to provide sufficient income for both of them, which left Susan in the position of provider. Waters was the primary income earner for herself and her husband. She was involved with the women's suffrage movement and animal rights activism.  Career  Waters' career as an artist began with commissioned portraits and lessons. Soliciting sitters as she moved between New York and Pennsylvania, Waters employed her talents to support herself and her husband. Instead of canvas, Waters used materials that were readily available to her, primarily mattress ticking, cotton, and linen. Waters and her husband became active in early forms of photography, taking Daguerreotypes and Ambrotypes. Waters‚Äô early paintings were enough to ensure herself and her husband some financial security, but she was interested in expanding her range of subject matter, as she indicated in an 1851 letter.EWaters, Susan C. and Paul D. Schweizer. ‚ÄúA Letter by Susan Waters Provides New Information on her Career.‚Äù American Art Journal. Vol. 19, No. 1 (1987): 76-77. As financial security allowed her to move away from contracted portraits, she had more freedom to experiment and explore other forms of expression. In 1866, the Waters moved to Bordentown, New Jersey, after years of temporary residences. There Waters created some of her best-known paintings of domesticated animals in pastoral settings‚Äîespecially sheep, which she had in her own yard. The works she produced in Bordentown brought recognition in her lifetime. In 1876, Waters was invited to show some of her paintings at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. In 1899 Waters left Bordentown for a nursing home in Trenton, NJ, where she died the following year. 1900 Dies in Trenton on July 7  Collections  Addison Gallery of American Art, MA Arnot Art Museum, NY The Burlington County Historical Society, NJ Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, AR Fenimore Art Museum, NY Maier Museum of Art at Randolph-Macon Woman‚Äôs College, VA Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.

He is also professor emeritus of psychology at the Universities of Hull and Plymouth in the United Kingdom, and the University of Connecticut in the United States. Kirsch is a leading researcher within the field of placebo studies who is noted for his work on placebo effects, antidepressants, expectancy, and hypnosis. He is the originator of response expectancy theory, and his analyses of clinical trials of antidepressants have influenced official treatment guidelines in the United Kingdom. He is the author of the 2009 book, The Emperor's New Drugs. Biography The son of Jewish immigrants from Poland and Russia, Kirsch was born in New York City on March 7, 1943. Kirsch received his PhD in psychology from the University of Southern California in 1975. While a graduate student, he produced, in conjunction with the National Lampoon, a hit single and subsequent record album entitled The Missing White House Tapes, which were crafted by doctoring tape recordings of Richard Nixon‚Äôs speeches and press conferences during the Watergate hearings. The album was nominated for a Grammy award as Best Comedy Recording in 1974. In 1975, Kirsch joined the psychology department at the University of Connecticut, where he worked until 2004, when he became a professor of psychology at the University of Plymouth. He moved to the University of Hull in 2007 and joined the faculty of the Harvard Medical School in 2011. Kirsch has authored or edited 10 books and more than 200 scientific journal articles and book chapters.\\"Irving Kirsch Biography.\\" Integrative Medicine & Health 2012. Web. 26 Mar. 2012. Theories and research = Response expectancy theory= Kirsch‚Äôs response expectancy theory is based on the idea that what people experience depends partly on what they expect to experience. According to Kirsch, this is the process that lies behind the placebo effect and hypnosis. The theory is supported by research showing that both subjective and physiological responses can be altered by changing people‚Äôs expectancies. The theory has been applied to understanding pain, depression, anxiety disorders, asthma, addictions, and psychogenic illnesses. =Research on antidepressants = Kirsch‚Äôs analysis of the effectiveness of antidepressants was an outgrowth of his interest in the placebo effect. His first meta-analysis was aimed at assessing the size of the placebo effect in the treatment of depression. The results not only showed a sizeable placebo effect, but also indicated that the drug effect was surprisingly small. This led Kirsch to shift his interest to evaluating the antidepressant drug effect. The controversy surrounding this analysis led Kirsch to obtain files from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) containing data from trials that had not been published, as well as those data from published trials. Analyses of the FDA data showed the average size effect of antidepressant drugs to be equal to 0.32, clinically insignificant according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2004 guidelines, requiring Cohen's d to be no less than 0.50. No evidence was cited to support this cut-off and it was criticised for being arbitrary; NICE removed the specification of criteria for clinical relevance in its 2009 guidelines. Kirsch challenges the chemical-imbalance theory of depression, writing \\"It now seems beyond question that the traditional account of depression as a chemical imbalance in the brain is simply wrong.\\" In 2014, in the British Psychological Society's Research Digest, Christian Jarrett included Kirsch's 2008 antidepressant placebo effect study in a list of the 10 most controversial psychology studies ever published. In September 2019 Irving Kirsch published a review in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, which concluded that antidepressants are of little benefit in most people with depression and thus they should not be used until evidence shows their benefit is greater than their risks. = Research on hypnosis= Kirsch has focused some of his research on the topic of hypnosis. The basis of his hypnosis theory is that placebo effects and hypnosis share a common mechanism: response expectancy. Kirsch's idea on this topic is that the effects of both hypnosis and placebos are based upon the beliefs of the participant. He has characterized clinical hypnosis as a \\"nondeceptive placebo.\\" See also * David Healy * John Ioannidis References  Selected bibliography         *  External links  * Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter website * CBS News 60 Minutes - Treating Depression: Is there a placebo effect?

They play music which can be classified as experimental psychedelic folk with drone elements and ambient influences. Formed in 1998, they released numerous albums, many of them in extremely limited quantities. Both members of Natural Snow Buildings release music also as solo artists: Mehdi Ameziane as TwinSisterMoon and Solange Gularte as Isengrind. History The beginnings of Natural Snow Buildings can be traced back to 1997, at a Paris university. They met in their school library where a film was playing. Mehdi had been invited to a party that evening but declined and headed to the library instead. After their first meeting, the two saw more of each other. Although Mehdi could play a bit of guitar and Solange was a classically trained musician, the two had not yet begun making music. It was in May 1998 that the two officially started their band and began home recording their music. They self-released two cassettes, Witch-Season and Two Sides of a Horse in 1999 and 2000, and in 2001 recorded Ghost Folks, released in 2003. Then, they self-released a double CD, The Winter Ray, in a limited edition, and, after moving from Paris to Vitr√©, Brittany in 2004, recorded The Dance of the Moon and the Sun (released in 2006). They then each issued solo material before producing more material as a duo. Most of their albums have only been released in small numbers, often in hand-crafted limited editions. Their work has been compared with such bands as Popol Vuh, Flying Saucer Attack, and Tower Recordings.Article on band by John Mulvey, Wild Mercury Sound, Uncut magazine, March 2010, p.10.

Enforced by the ecclesiastical courts who had responsibility for the moral behaviour of the laity, buttock mail was levied as a fine for sexual intercourse out of wedlock. Etymology In the 17th century, and perhaps earlier when the law that became known as buttock mail was passed, buttock was a colloquial term for a prostitute. The term mail is an old Scots word meaning a monetary tribute or payment, from the same root as the word blackmail. Thus, the term buttock mail literally means a monetary payment related to prostitution, referring to its being a fine for fornication, or sex outside of marriage. History Ecclesiastical courts had existed since the Norman invasion. While secular courts were tasked with enforcing secular laws, the responsibility of the ecclesiastical courts was to enforce religious and moral laws. This included discipline of the clergy, enforcement of probate and wills, as well as enforcement of laws that kept the laity within moral bounds. These ecclesiastical courts were very powerful until the late 17th century, when the Glorious Revolution removed much of their power. The remaining jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was removed in the 19th century. Fornication was against the law, and punishments were enforced by these ecclesiastical courts. The normal punishment was a public confession through use of the Stool of Repentance, but payment of buttock mail commuted this sentence, allowing the convicted fornicator to avoid public humiliation. The term buttock mail was in use from the 16th until the 19th century.

The station was established in 1856 and the lighthouse itself was built in 1899. History A petition to the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island was presented in order to build a lighthouse at Cascumpec Harbour in 1848 followed by another in 1853. The lighthouse was built on Sandy Island, at the entrance of the harbour, and became active the following year. In 1876 was built a new lighthouse because the previous was decayed by age; the white tower was high and a front range tower was built no far toward the shore in order to indicate the channel. In October 1879 a gale damaged heavily the tower particularly at the foundation. The area underwent to various works to fight the shore erosion and in 1899 the lighthouse was relocated toward south in a protected place. In 1901 two open towers, with enclosed lantern, replaced the lighthouse. A new light was built in October 1968, it was a skeletal tower with balcony, lantern and a central staircase covered by a wooden structure painted with white and red stripes. In 1999 the lighthouse was degraded and in 2004 the winter storms damaged the place so that the Canadian Coast Guard decided to deactivate the light and to dismantle the tower.

Retrieved 13 January 2014. Other human rights problems include violence against detainees; lengthy pretrial detentions and failure to provide due process of law; harassment of journalists; corruption in government; violence against and harassment of women; child prostitution and abuse; trafficking in persons; encroachment on indigenous lands and discrimination against indigenous and Afro-descendent communities; violence against and harassment of LGBT persons; ineffective enforcement of labor laws; and child labor. Organized criminal elements were significant perpetrators of violent crimes in the country and committed acts of murder, extortion, kidnapping, torture, human trafficking, and intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders. The government has taken steps to prosecute and punish officials who commit abuses . However, corruption and impunity remain serious problems that impede the effectiveness of the National Police. Pre-twentieth century Pre-1979 During much of the twentieth century, Honduras did not have civilian governments. Military leaders frequently became presidents, either through elections or by coups d'√©tat. General Tiburcio Car√≠as Andino was elected in 1932, he later on called a constituent assembly that allowed him to be reelected, and his rule became more authoritarian until an election in 1948. During the following decades, coups d'√©tat occurred in October 1955 by a group of military officers, in October 1963 (1963 Honduran coup d'√©tat) and December 1972 by General Oswaldo L√≥pez Arellano, in 1975 by Juan Alberto Melgar Castro (1975 Honduran coup d'√©tat) and in 1978 by Policarpo Paz Garc√≠a. 1980s Following the return to civilian government with a new constitution in 1982, the military unit Intelligence Battalion 3-16 carried out a systematic program of political assassinations and torture of suspected political opponents of the government. Battalion members received training and support from the United States Central Intelligence Agency both in Honduras and at United States military bases and in Chile during the presidency of the dictator Augusto Pinochet.Equipo Nizkor, LA APARICION DE OSAMENTAS EN UNA ANTIGUA BASE MILITAR DE LA CIA EN HONDURAS REABRE LA PARTICIPACION ARGENTINO-NORTEAMERICANA EN ESE PAIS., Margen Amnesty International estimated that at least 184 people were \\"disappeared\\" from 1980 to 1992 in Honduras, most likely by the Honduran military. At least 19 members of Battalion 3-16 were graduates of the School of the Americas at Fort Benning in the USA. In 1982, in response to these human rights violations, 12 families of disappeared Hondurans, including Bertha Oliva de Nativ√≠, whose husband Professor Tom√°s Nativ√≠ was disappeared in 1981, created the human rights NGO Committee of Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras (Comit√© de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos en Honduras, COFADEH).COFADEH, Quienes Somos, accessed 26 July 2009 Other human rights NGOs, including the Center for the Investigation and Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CIPRODEH) for the western region of Honduras, the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH), and the Civic Council of Grassroots and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), were also created. Zelaya presidency (2006-2009) Seven former members of Battalion 3-16 (Billy Joya, Alvaro Romero, Erick S√°nchez, Onofre Oyuela Oyuela, Napole√≥n Nassar Herrera, Vicente Rafael Canales Nu√±ez, Salom√≥n Escoto Salinas and Ren√© Maradianga Pancham√©) occupied important positions in the administration of President Manuel Zelaya as of mid-2006, according to the human rights organisation CODEH. Napole√≥n Nassar was high Commissioner of Police for the north-west region under Zelaya. Roberto Micheletti de facto presidency = Background = Following the 2009 coup d'√©tat, in which Zelaya was detained and exiled by Honduran military units, de facto President Roberto Micheletti appointed former Battalion 3-16 member Billy Joya as his security advisor, former Battalion 3-16 member Nelson Willy Mej√≠a Mej√≠a became Director of Immigration, and former Battalion 3-16 member Napole√≥n Nassar Herrera, who had already become a high Commissioner of Police, also became a spokesperson \\"for dialogue\\" for the Secretary of Security. Zelaya claimed that Billy Joya had reactivated the death squad. A state of emergency was operational for most of July and continued into August. This suspended civil liberties including freedom of transit and due process, as well as permitting search and seizure without a warrant.\\"High Noon in Honduras\\", Lara Carlsen, Alternet, 4 July 2009. A curfew law was introduced, without having been published in La Gazeta, nor being approved by Congress. Curfew times are announced on radio stations, differ daily and between regions of Honduras. Amnesty International described the curfew implementation as \\"arbitrary\\". The ambassadors of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua said that on the 29th they were detained and beaten by Honduran troops before being released. Several government officials were taken into custody by the military. A dozen former ministers from the Zelaya government went into hiding, some in foreign embassies, fearing arrest. Local media reported that at least eight ministers besides Patricia Rodas had been detained. During the first few weeks of the Micheletti period, hundreds of political arrests were made. COFADEH reported that 609 people, of whom at least 61 minors, were detained for \\"political scandal\\" (participation in political demonstrations), and 158 were detained for violating curfew, between 28 June and 12 July. Amnesty International (AI) stated that during the Micheletti period, \\"increasingly disproportionate and excessive use of force [was] being used by the police and military to repress legitimate and peaceful protests across the country\\". AI also said that \\"some women and girls taking part in the demonstrations are reportedly suffering gender based violence and abuse at the hands of police officers\\" and that at the same time that \\"protests increase and spread throughout the country, violent methods of repressing dissent intensify and Honduran citizens are increasingly exposed to violations of their fundamental rights.\\" On 31 July, Zelaya claimed that Battalion 3-16 was again operating, with a different name, and being led by Billy Joya. Zelaya stated (translation), \\"With a different name, [Battalion 3-16 is] already operating. The crimes being committed is torture to create fear among the population, and that's being directed by Mr. Joya.\\" =Forced disappearances= On 5 July, in San Juan Pueblo, Atl√°ntida, four people wearing police vests forcefully disappeared Anastasio Barrera, 55 years old, of the National Union of Rural Workers. On 12 July, in San Pedro Sula, Manuel Sevilla, 19 years old, was disappeared after returning from a demonstration. Samuel David Flores Murillo, 24 years old was disappeared on 26 July 2009. His mother, Margarita Murillo, was herself detained and tortured for 22 days in the 1980s. =Extrajudicial executions= The death of Vicky Hern√°ndez Castillo (born Sonny Emelson Hern√°ndez), a member of the LGBT community who was killed by a bullet in the eye during the curfew of the night of 29 to 30 June and displayed signs of strangulation, is attributed to the coup d'√©tat by COFADEH. On 3 July in Tegucigalpa, Alexis Fernando Amador, 25 yrs old, was found dead in a blue plastic barrel with mortal wounds in his head, wearing a T-shirt referring to the \\"cuarta urna\\" (Fourth ballot box) that might have been voted on in the poll relating to organising a constituent assembly in Honduras. His parents said he had disappeared the day before, and insisted that the shirt he was found in was not his, and that he had left for work in a red shirt. COFADEH attributes his death to the coup d'√©tat. Also on 3 July, journalist Gabriel Fino Noriega who had expressed opinions in favour of the project to hold a constituent assembly in Honduras and against the coup d'√©tat, was killed by 7 bullets when he left his workplace. COFADEH attributes his assassination to the coup d'√©tat, while an international human rights mission considered Noriega's political points of view to offer a line of research for understanding the death, but insufficient proof that the reason for the killing was political. On 5 July, when soldiers prevented a plane carrying Zelaya from landing at Toncontin Airport, Isis Obed Murillo Mencias, the 19-year-old son of a social and environmental activist, Jose David Murillo Sanchez, 57 years old, was shot in the back of the head, while participating in a protest that attempted to tear down a fence. According to the Miami Herald, Isis Obed Murillo was shot by soldiers who tried to prevent people passing through the fence. It was later claimed by unknown sources that the shot did not came from the soldiers' position, but rather from the protest's direction. According to another unnamed source, while the soldiers did carry weapons, they were M16 rifles, which did not match the 9 mm bullet hole found on Murillo. Isis Obed Murillo was taken to Escuela Hospital and his body taken to the Francisco Morazan Judicial Morgue. On 9 July at 11:30 in the morning, Jose David Murillo was detained by Direccion Nacional de Investigacion Criminal (DNIC) agents when he left the offices of COFADEH. Since then he has been held at the Juticalpa Penal Centre in an isolation cell three metres by three metres in size, without a bed. Images of Isis Obed Murillo's bloodstained body were widely circulated and became a focal point for people opposed to the coup d'√©tat. Roger Iv√°n Bados (sometimes written B√°ez), a former union leader, who had become a member of the Democratic Unification Party and the Popular Bloque (BP), was \\"threatened with death immediately after the coup\\" and shot dead on 11 July next to his house in San Pedro Sula. According to Dr Luther Castillo of the Garifuna community organisation Luaga Hatuadi Waduhe√±u Foundation, the assassination \\"can be directly attributed to\\" the Micheletti's de facto government. An international human rights mission also attributes Bados' death \\"in relation to\\" the coup d'√©tat. The death of 40-year-old campesino leader Ram√≥n Garc√≠a, also a member of the Democratic Unification Party, on 12 July, after he was forced by unknown people to get off a bus, is also attributed to Micheletti's de facto government by Luther Castillo. On 24 July, near the border town El Para√≠so, conflict occurred between hundreds of protesters against the coup d'√©tat and security forces. Many people saw protester Pedro Magdiel Mu√±oz Salvador, 23 years old, being detained by police and driven to a police station in El Para√≠so. The following morning, his body was found in a deserted field at 6:30 in the morning, with 42 wounds from stabbing. Demonstrators and the National Front Against the Coup d'√âtat stated that the murder had all the characteristics of 1980s actions of Battalion 3-16, as a method of \\"terrorising the masses of people participating in the struggle against the coup regime.\\" On 31 July, during a peaceful protest that blocked a highway on the first day of a public service national strike against the coup d'√©tat, high school teacher Roger Abraham Vallejo Soriano, 38 years old, was shot in the head by security forces. He died the following day. Another assassination in the region near the Nicaraguan border near El Para√≠so took place on 2 August when a soldier at a military roadblock fatally shot Pedro Pablo Hern√°ndez in the head. COFADEH attributes his assassination to the coup d'√©tat. The Office of the Public Prosecutor stated to IACHR during the latter's 17‚Äì21 August visit that the case was being investigated. On 8 August in Choloma, Juan Gabriel Figueroa Tom√©, 30 yrs old, who was an active member of resistance to the coup d'√©tat, was taken by armed men who said that they didn't want his motorbike, they wanted him. He was found dead, shot in the head, the following day, 9 August. COFADEH attributes his assassination to the coup d'√©tat. =Zelaya return= Zelaya returned to Honduras on 21 September 2009, and stayed in the Brazilian Embassy, while Micheletti remained the de facto president. Security forces under the responsibility of de facto president Micheletti carried out systematic human rights violations, including a \\"sharp rise in police beatings,\\" hundreds of arrests of political demonstrators and intimidation of human rights defenders throughout Honduras. On 22 September, 15 police fired tear gas canisters at the building of the human rights NGO Committee of Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH), at a moment when about 100 people were in the COFADEH office. Dozens of protesters were detained in unauthorised detention sites in Tegucigalpa on 22 September. On 16 October 2009, Human Rights Watch stated that \\"the small human rights unit of the Office of the Attorney General has begun investigations into numerous cases of killings, alleged excessive use of force by security officials, and illegal and arbitrary detentions\\" but that the unit's superiors in the Attorney General's office and armed forces members were obstructing the investigations. The Micheletti de facto government issued Decree PCM-M-016-2009 which officially signed on 22 September 2009 and rescinded on 19 October 2009. The decree suspended five constitutional rights: personal liberty (Article 69), freedom of expression (Article 72), freedom of movement (Article 81), habeas corpus (Article 84) and freedom of association. On 28 September, the decree was used to shut down the television stations Channel 36 and Radio Globo, which were \\"consistently critical of the de facto government\\" and removed the stations' broadcasting equipment. Government security forces physically assaulted international journalists covering the raid on Radio Globo. On 29 September, the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IAHCR) \\"expressed its most energetic rejection\\" of the decree and asked for the immediate suspension of its enforcement, because it \\"flagrantly [contradicted] the international standards for freedom of expression\\". Amnesty International protested to the Honduran de facto government about the violation of habeas corpus on 28 and 29 November. One of the people who were allegedly disappeared was Jensys Mario Umanzor Gutierrez, last seen in police detention early on the morning of 30 November. Amnesty International (AI) stated that no courts, including the Supreme Court, were available to receive a petition for habeas corpus. AI also referred to two men arrested under terrorism charges and beaten, and 14 minors detained under decree PCM-M-016-2009 for having been gathered in groups of more than four persons, and later freed without charges. AI also said that human rights organizations in Honduras \\"suffered attacks and acts of intimidation\\". In December 2009 the head of Honduras' anti-drug smuggling operations, Gen Julian Aristides Gonzalez, was assassinated in Tegucigalpa,BBC, 8 December 2009, Honduras anti-drug chief shot dead by gunmen as was anti-coup activist and LGBT rights leader Walter Trochez. Porfirio Lobo Sosa Porfirio Lobo Sosa won the November Honduran general election, 2009 and took office on 27 January 2010. Under his Presidency human rights abuses continued. According to Human Rights Watch, \\"at least eight journalists and ten members of the National Popular Resistance Front (FNRP)‚Äîa political group that opposed the 2009 coup and advocated the reinstatement of the ousted president, Manuel Zelaya‚Äîhave been killed since President Lobo assumed power on January 27, 2010.\\"Human Rights Watch, 29 July 2010, Honduras: Ongoing Attacks Foster Climate of Intimidation Journalist David Meza was assassinated in March 2010; he investigated drug trafficking within Honduras, and reportedly received death threats in 2010, according to the El Tiempo newspaper. Another reporter, Nah√∫m El√≠ Palacios Arteaga, was also assassinated in March 2010. Luis Arturo Mondrag√≥n was killed in June 2010. Human Rights Watch has reported attacks on the independence of the judiciary and public prosecutors. \\"The May dismissal of four lower-court judges who challenged the legality of the 2009 coup has severely damaged the credibility of the Honduran judiciary.\\" One of the dismissed judges \\"told Human Rights Watch that, since his dismissal, several judges have confided in him that the fear of dismissal by the government influences their judicial decision-making. A prosecutor from the human rights prosecutor's office said fellow prosecutors had expressed the same concern.\\" Human Rights Watch concluded that \\"Honduras has made little progress toward restoring the rule of law since the coup.\\" See also * Human trafficking in Honduras * Internet censorship and surveillance in Honduras * List of journalists killed in Honduras * LGBT rights in Honduras * Gender inequality in Honduras References External links *One Year After Coup, Honduras Repression Continues - video report by Democracy Now!

It is an affiliate of Virginia Mason Medical Center. thumb  History  Bailey-Boushay House was the first inpatient hospice facility for AIDS patients in the United States. It was founded by Betsy Lieberman and Christine Hurley of AIDS Housing of Washington with support from sources including Virginia Mason Medical Center, Boeing, Nordstrom, Weyerhaeuser, the Northwest AIDS Foundation, and an anonymous donation of $100,000 via the Archdiocese of Seattle. The facility was created as a response to the lack of skilled nursing facilities available for AIDS patients. Its planned location in the Madison Valley neighborhood drew opposition due to concerns about the proposed outpatient population. At the time, a member of the facility's opposition was on the board of the Seattle Art Museum. In May 1990, the Seattle chapter of ACT UP scheduled a shutdown of the museum construction site to show support for local AIDS patients, but two days before the shutdown the opposition relented. The facility was named after Seattle publisher Thatcher Bailey, a founding donor, and his partner Frank Boushay, who died of AIDS in 1989. Bailey-Boushay House was dedicated on January 12, 1992. By 1992, over 2,000 cases of AIDS had been diagnosed in King County, with 90% of the cases present in men who have sex with men. In the first years at Bailey-Boushay, patients would often arrive from hospitals only a few days before their death from AIDS-related complications. In the early 1990s, the photographers Saul Bromberger and Sandra Hoover documented the daily life of Bailey-Boushay patients, and their work was published in Mother Jones magazine on World AIDS Day in 2014. Every year on Valentine's Day, Bailey-Boushay House used to place hundreds of red balloons on the outside of their facility to officially thank the community for their support.  Current work  As of 2017, due to the significant decrease in death rates from HIV/AIDS due to antiretroviral therapy, the 35-bed inpatient program at Bailey-Boushay House serves patients with a variety of life-threatening diagnoses, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease, providing long-term, respite, and end-of-life care. The outpatient day health program serves patients with HIV who are homeless, and/or capable of living independently in the community but require medication management and social support. Bailey-Boushay House plans to open a 50-bed overnight shelter to promote housing stability for its outpatient clients, with a projected opening date of November 1, 2018. Over the past two years, the Daily Outpatient Program has exploded from 100 outpatients to over 400 outpatients. This fact, combined with the complexities of opening a new overnight shelter for the homeless, is causing prolonged increasing strain to the Daily Outpatient Program, resulting in the loss of events regularly provided to benefit the Outpatients' health and enriching their lives [as of Oct. 2018].

Gameplay involves the player's character running back and forth on a side-scrolling planet surface, attempting to catch the Griffins. The player finds crates which contain items that the player can use to help catch the bird - or the player can simply try and run and jump on top of the bird, thus catching it. During playtime, there is a time limit by which a bird must be caught (indicated by a roast chicken slowly turning into chicken bones), or else the game ends. At later stages in the game, the player must navigate abandoned mines, where the Griffins may be hiding, and even use a mortar to shell Griffins as they move across a landscape. Development The game was based upon an abandoned project called Attack of the Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens From Mars by Matthew Smith.

Like its closest relatives, Acanthoplus discoidalis variously bears common names such as armoured katydid', armoured ground cricket, armoured bush cricket, corn cricket, setotojane and '. The species is native to parts of Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Developing Integrated Pest Management Strategies for Control of the Armoured Bush Cricket, Acanthoplus Discoidalis (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). Poster 120 Mosupi, P. O. P., J. van den Berg, M. A. McGeoch & S. V. Green Note that the common names are characteristically misleading; the species is not closely related to true crickets, which are a different family, the Gryllidae. Description Acanthoplus discoidalis is a wide-bodied, flightless species that typically grows to a body length of about 5 cm/1.95 inches. The pronotum bears several sharp, conical spines. The mandibles, or main biting jaws, are powerful; they can inflict a painful nip and they permit the insect to feed on material such as tough herbage or carrion. Another defense against predators is reflex bleeding (also called \\"autohaemorrhaging\\") in which the insects squirt haemolymph from pores in their exoskeleton, achieving a range of a few centimetres. Diet Acanthoplus discoidalis is omnivorous and feeds opportunistically on many different foods. One source documented attacks on red-billed quelea nestlings and suggested that the insects might be able to detect the nests by auditory clues. Especially when their diet is deficient in protein and salt, members of the species commonly become cannibalistic, so much so that when their populations peak in autumn and some of them stray across roads and are crushed by traffic, cannibalistic conspecifics congregate around the casualties and feed until they are killed in turn. During that season their remains may form large patches on roads. Defence Acanthoplus discoidalis has several defensive mechanisms apart from the armoured exoskeleton. Their defence takes various forms, depending on the gender of the individual and the method of attack. When attacked from the side, both males and females will attempt to bite the attacker and males will stridulate (females have no functional stridulatory mechanism). In about half the attacks from the side, either gender may autohaemorrhage, squirting between 5 mg and 80 mg of possibly toxic haemolymph at the attacker at ranges of up to 3 cm. When attacked from above, and therefore not in a good position to bite the attacker, either gender will autohaemorrhage more than when attacked from the side. Experiments have shown that the haemolymph is distasteful to at least two reptile species, but the repellent components have not been determined. It has been hypothesised that they may be phytotoxins found in plants that the insects eat and that they then sequester those substances to use as defensive compounds themselves. After autohaemorrhaging the insects clean themselves meticulously. This is thought to reduce the probability that other members of the species will attack them cannibalistically. Research on the species suggests that autohaemorrhage is a precisely regulated defence response rather than an accidental consequence of being attacked. Another defensive response is to regurgitate their stomach contents when attacked, which happens most often when the insect has already been attacked repeatedly. Reproduction In Acanthoplus discoidalis, courtship and mating is a relatively slow process; it starts at sunset and usually is completed by sunrise. First the stridulation of the males attracts females. The male produces a large spermatophore that includes a sperm pouch and an attached spermatophylax, a portion of food that serves as a nuptial gift to the female. Having mated, a male cannot mate again before he has had time to grow a new spermatophore. A female must mate before laying her first clutch of eggs. Thereafter she may mate and lay eggs again in any arbitrary order, as she can store sperm. Accordingly, it is advantageous for males to mate with virgins, as a higher proportion of the offspring of a virgin female will be their own. Virgins are lighter than non-virgins, which offers males a basis for distinguishing them when copulating. Males accordingly complete more matings with virgins than non-virgins and they transfer their spermatophore more quickly. Control Acanthoplus discoidalis is a pest of sorghum and millet in Southern Africa. In bad years, they may cause crop losses of up to 40%. Insecticides can control infestations, but as Acanthoplus discoidalis are flightless they can be controlled fairly easily by constructing a 50 cm deep trench around the field. If it seems worth while, poisoned baits in the trenches can increase the intensity of control. It has been suggested that the insects could be collected and used as a high protein chicken feed.

This plant is a shrub producing a branching stem usually about one to two meters tall, but known to exceed 4 meters at times. The leaves are roughly lance-shaped and are alternately arranged, sometimes more densely toward the ends of branches. They are up to 10 or 15 centimeters long. The inflorescence is often a wide array of several flower heads, but they may also be clustered in the leaf axils or branch tips. The head contains a few yellow ray florets, which are pistillate, and up to 25 or more yellow disc florets, which are bisexual. The fruit is a rough-textured, pyramidal or prism-shaped cypsela up to a centimeter long including its pappus of many barbed white bristles. This plant is abundant in parts of its range, particularly in Mexico, sometimes becoming weedy. It flowers year-round, especially in spring, and it may be in full flower at the end of the dry season. It is admired for its yellow flower heads and is cultivated as an ornamental plant. The plant is used in Mexican traditional medicine to treat fever and rheumatism.Gonz√°lez, C. P., et al. (2013).

It is endemic to the Western Cape of South Africa, where it grows in vernal pools. It was at one time classified as Cadiscus aquaticus, the only species in the monotypic genus Cadiscus, but molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that it is nested within Senecio. It is a floating or emergent plant with small narrow leaves and white-rayed flowers. Its populations are small and fragmented, and are declining. The plant is threatened by grazing and trampling by livestock, invasive plants, reclamation of wetlands and eutrophication from fertilizer runoff. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has consequently rated it as \\"critically endangered\\". Taxonomy This plant was known as Cadiscus aquaticus, the only species in the monotypic genus Cadiscus, until molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated it was clearly nested among the species of Senecio.Pelser, P. B., et al. (2010). Patterns and causes of incongruence between plastid and nuclear Senecioneae (Asteraceae) phylogenies. American Journal of Botany 97(5), 856-73. It was moved there and renamed S. cadiscus in 2009. Some authorities still accept its former name.Cadiscus. The Plant List. Description This is an aquatic plant that grows in vernal pools. It is floating or emergent and sometimes terrestrial along the pool margins. Young plants are submerged. Flowering occurs in August and September. The plant has narrow, floating leaves and white ray florets. The fruit is a cypsela with a pappus of coarse bristles and small tufts of hairs that become sticky and slimy when wet. These may be adaptations to zoochory, in which seeds are dispersed by animals, perhaps waterfowl.Nordenstam, B., et al. (2009). The South African aquatic genus Cadiscus (Compositae-Senecioneae) sunk in Senecio. Compositae Newsletter 47: 28‚Äì32. Status The plant is restricted to vernal pool habitat. It is known from a few localities, and has been recently extirpated from a few others. It does not occur in all of the vernal pools that are apparently available to it, and it probably does not have the ability to disperse easily. Populations are thought to have declined over 70% in the last 100 years, and declines are ongoing. Threats to the plant and its vernal pool ecosystem include grazing and trampling by cattle and horses, reclamation of wetlands, use of heavy machinery on the land, invasive species of grasses introduced when livestock feed is discarded in the area, and eutrophication from fertilizer runoff.Senecio cadiscus.

The genus currently consist of only one species, Phaneroglossa bolusii, a perennial plant of up to high, that has leathery, line- to lance-shaped, seated leaves with mostly few shallow teeth and flower heads set individually on top of long stalks. The flower head has an involucre of just one whorl of bracts, few elliptic, white or cream ray florets, and many yellow disc florets. It is an endemic species of the Western Cape province of South Africa. Flowering mainly occurs from November to January.  Description  HabitPhaneroglossa is a low, up to high, perennial plant that is hairless except for the woolly leaf axils, and has short, woody, upwardly inclined stems. Its leaves are crowded on the short stems, leathery in consistency, and set alternately along the stem. The leaves are line-, lance- or inverted lance-shaped, with a conspicuous midvein, seated with the base more of less clasping the stem, with an entire margin or some shallow teeth, often slightly curving down, the tip tapering or ending abruptly in a small sharp point as a continuation of the midvein. The flower heads are set on top of long, stout, unbranched stalks with few, scattered, awl-, line- or lance-shaped bracts. The flowerhead has an involucre that is initially cup-shaped with a flat base, later becomes broadly cone-shaped, while the bracts eventually flip down to press against the stem when the seeds are ripe. It consists of a single whorl of eleven to fifteen lance-shaped, leathery bracts, with one or three resin ducts tapering to a long point, that are merged at their base, with a distinct thin and dryish margin that has a fringe of soft hairs towards the tips. The common base of the florets is flat and wide, without bracts at the foot of each floret, with a smooth surface except for regularly distributed indents where the florets are implanted. The flower heads each have five to eight female ray florets that consist of a closed tube at base and a strap nearer the top. The tube is cylinder-shaped and has a few to many blunt hairs, which are several rows of cells thick and are topped with glands. The straps are white or cream-coloured, elliptic or obtuse in shape, mostly have four veins and is split in three teeth at the tip. From the mouth of the ray floret tube emerges a style that splits in two outward curling, hairless branches each topped by an obtuse conical appendage. Surrounding the base of the ray floret corolla are many, white, barbed pappus bristles which are quickly shed in the ray florets. At the base of the ray floret develop eventually dark brown to black, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae, which are oblong in shape, and have five or six wing-like, hairless ridges along their lengths. The ray florets surround many bisexual disc florets with a yellow, tube-shaped corolla that near its top splits star-like into five, outward curving oval lobes with a vein parallel to their margin, a central resin duct and a finely grainy surface near the tips. In the center of each corolla are free filaments, topped by five anthers that are merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. The anthers have an arrow-shaped base, and one large, oval appendage at their tip, that is wider than the anther. The filaments each have a distinct bulbous collar just below the anthers. The pappus of the disc florets is persistent, and the cypselae are narrowly oblong, and have always five wings covered with blunt hairs that become slimy when wet.  Taxonomy  This plant was first described by Daniel Oliver in 1884, based on a specimen that had been collected by Harry Bolus on Michell's Pass near Ceres. Bertil Nordenstam, in his revision the tribe Senecioneae, erected the new genus Phaneroglossa, because of the many unusual features exhibited by P. bolusii, and the difficulty to determine its affinities to other species on morphological arguments. = Phylogeny = Comparison of homologous DNA has increased the insight in the phylogenetic relationships between the Senecioneae. It shows that Phaneroglossa is most closely related to Austrosynotis rectirama, Oresbia heterocarpa and the genus Dendrosenecio. Further research that includes more species and more or other genes may change these insights. The following tree represents current insights.  Distribution, habitat and conservation  Phaneroglossa can only be found in the Hex River Mountains and in the Kouebokkeveld Mountains near Ceres, where it grows on sandstone slopes in fynbos vegetations at high altitude. It is considered a rare species.

The single species, Rainiera stricta, is endemic to the northwestern United States (Oregon and Washington). The genus is part of the tribe Senecioneae, and appears to be most closely related to Luina, another genus of northwestern North America, in which it was once placed. Rainiera stricta is of conservation concern, with a G2G3 ranking from NatureServe, and is considered to be globally imperiled. It is known by the common name false silverback. Description Rainiera stricta is an herbaceous perennial with both basal and cauline, alternate, petiolate leaves. It has 30-70 discoid heads arranged in a raceme-like or thyrse-like capitulescence. The disk florets are about 5 per head, and have yellow, sometimes purple-tinged corollas. The cypselae (achenes) are glabrous and have a pappus of white or straw-colored bristles. It is distinguished from Luina by the having fewer florets per head and a racemiform, rather than corymbiform, capitulescence.

He was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes for talking publicly about sex. After the program by the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) which included his comments aired, the Saudi government shut down the LBC's two offices in the country.

On the show, Jawad talked about having sex at the age of 14 with a neighbour and picking up women using the Bluetooth function on his cellphone (as they are forbidden to interact with men in public), and revealed a recipe for an aphrodisiac.Layalina Staff (2009). The Layalina Review On Public Diplomacy And Arab Media . The Layalina Review. 5 (16):1-17. The program also showed Abdul- Jawad leading viewers into his bedroom, dominated by red accessories, and showing off sex toys, which were blurred for viewing. Later, three male friends join him for a discussion on what turns them on. Arrest and conviction Jawad was arrested on July 31 for publicising vice, after Saudi religious and judicial authorities received what they said were hundreds of complaints from the public regarding the program. A police spokesman in Jeddah said that Abdul Jawad's appearance had violated Saudi Arabia's Islamic Sharia law code and was against Saudi customs. An anonymous source from the Saudi Prosecution and Investigation Commission (PIC) stated that the prosecution might request charging Jawad and the other defendants for Hirabah, a crime defined as \\"waging unlawful warfare (in speech or action) against the state and society\\". The punishment for such a crime would be beheading. On October 7, 2009, Jawad was convicted by a Jeddah court on charges based on Sharia law. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment and 1,000 lashes. The sentence also includes a ban on travel and talking to the media for five years after his release.Abu-Nasr, Donna (October 7, 2009). Saudi gets 5 years in jail for frank TV sex talk. Associated Press. The other three men on the show were also convicted of discussing sex publicly. They were sentenced to two years imprisonment and 300 lashes each. A cameraman who helped film the episode was sentenced to two months in jail. A female journalist at LBC, one of two arrested, was sentenced to 60 lashes.Usher, Sebastian (October 24, 2009). Lashes for Saudi woman journalist. BBC News. Statements Jawad's lawyer, Sulaiman al-Jumeii, said the case should not be considered closed, and that he planned to appeal the court's ruling, claiming that the decision was made \\"under pressure from public opinion\\". He maintained that Jawad was not referring to his own sexual experiences and that the toys shown on the program were not his own. He further argued that the case was tried before the wrong court, and that it should have been heard by a specialized court at the Information Ministry qualified to issue decisions regarding technical issues related to the case. Al-Jumeii filed a lawsuit against LBC, maintaining that his client was duped by the media corporation and was unaware in many cases he was being recorded. Other On August 7, YouTube disabled comments for the video clip of the program. Before the clip was blocked by the government censor in Saudi Arabia, it was viewed more than 430,000 times.

The currently applicable legislation in Egypt with regard to copyright is Book Three of the Law on the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights 82 of 2002, which entered into force on 3 June 2002, the day following its publication in the Official Gazette. The implementing decree is Prime Ministerial Decree 497 of 2005 (effective by Issue No. 12, Official Gazette, 29 March 2005). Legislative texts Prior to 1954, there was no legislation in Egypt protecting artistic and literary property.Yasser OMAR AMINE, The Forgotten Memory of the History of the Egyptian Copyright Law : the jurist M. Linant de Bellefonds, M. Pupikofer and E. Piola Caselli (La m√©moire oubli√©e de l'histoire du droit d'auteur √©gyptien : Les juristes M. Linant de Bellefonds, M. Pupikofer et E. Piola Caselli), Publisher Dar El Nahda El Arabia, Cairo, 2014-2015, 602 p. (in Arabic and part in French) Despite the absence of any such legislation, indigenous and mixed courts invoked principles of natural law and justice to protect intellectual property rights.Yasser OMAR AMINE, \\"Chronique d'√âgypte\\", RIDA, janv. 2010, n¬∞ 223. However, indigenous and mixed courts had two different approaches to sanctioning violations. Indigenous courts refused to apply criminal law provisions, on the ground that no criminal responsibility could be determined in the absence of a specific legislative text dealing with artistic and literary property. On the other hand, mixed courts did not wait for implementing regulations to be enacted. In a hearing on 17 February 1941, the Criminal Chamber of Cassation, Mixed Court of Appeal, ruled that performance of a song or musical composition, without the authorization of the author or composer, was considered as an offence punishable under Article 351 of the Penal Law. =Law 354 of 1954= Literary and artistic protection were dealt with for the first time by Egyptian law in 1954, with the promulgation of Law No. 354 of 1954 on the Protection of Copyright. Article 20 of the law provided for a term of protection of 50 years after the author's death, although this was reduced to 15 years from publication in the case of \\"works of photography and audiovisual works that are not of creative character and merely consist of a mechanical reproduction of scenes.\\" Official documents were explicitly excluded from copyright protection (Art. 4). =Law 82 of 2002= The 1954 law was repealed in its entirety when the new Intellectual Property Law 82 of 2002 entered into force on 3 June 2002. The new law retains many provisions contained in the previous law, notably the 50-year p.m.a. term of copyright protection (Art. 160). However, it also introduces several new concepts, among them the concept of national folklore (Art. 138 & 142). The new law also deals for the first time ever with the protection of neighbouring rights (Art. 153 and following). However, the new law is not without its critics. The International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) has repeatedly highlighted in its reports a number of shortcomings in the law, stating in its Special 301 Report published in 2009 that \\"the Copyright Law and the Implementing Decree, while suitable to enforce against copyright piracy in general, left unresolved some TRIPS deficiencies, other ambiguities in protection, and important gaps for protection recommended by IIPA in order to modernize protection.\\" Among the controversial provisions of the law is Article 148, which states that all foreign-language literary works fall into the public domain if they are not translated into Arabic within three years of publication.Yasser OMAR AMINE, ¬´ Abrogeons l‚Äôarticle 148 du Code √©gyptien de la propri√©t√© intellectuelle (droit de traduction et droit d‚Äôauteur en √âgypte) ¬ª, Communication ‚Äì commerce √©lectronique, nov. 2011, n¬∞ 11, alerte 88, p. 2Yasser OMAR AMINE, ¬´ Le droit international priv√© du droit d‚Äôauteur en √âgypte : √† la crois√©e des chemins ¬ª, Revue Critique de Droit International Priv√©, janvier-mars 2013/1, pp. 75-100 =Proposal to copyright antiquities= In late 2007, reports surfaced in the media that Egypt intended to pass a law requiring the payment of royalties whenever copies were made of its antiquities and monuments. Zahi Hawass, the head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told AFP news agency that the law would not affect buildings such as the Luxor Las Vegas hotel because it was not an exact copy of a pyramid and its interior was completely different.Yasser OMAR AMINE, ¬´ Intellectual Property... and the protection of pharaonic monuments ¬ª, Review of Al-Mejalla, ed. The General Egyptian Book Organization, January 2014, n¬∞ 20, p. 7-12 (in Arabic). BBC News stated that \\"MPs are expected to pass\\" the law, although it is unclear whether the proposal ever made it through Parliament. International agreements Egypt is a signatory to various international copyright agreements. The Berne Convention entered into force in Egypt on 7 June 1977, and the Phonograms Convention on 23 April 1978. Egypt became a member of the World Trade Organization on 30 June 1995. Piracy As early as 1985, Egypt has been targeted by the IIPA. Based on the results of the Special 301 Report (which \\"examines in detail the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property rights\\" in many countries around the world), the United States Trade Representative (USTR) placed Egypt on the Priority Watch List in 1992. The USTR lowered Egypt to the Watch List in 2008. The problem of piracy is pervasive in Egypt. The IIPA stated in a 2009 report that Egypt is \\"a nightmare market for right holders, stunted by piracy, difficult bureaucracy, and almost unparalleled market access hurdles.\\" Trade losses due to copyright piracy amounted to nearly $119 million in 2007, with a piracy level of 32% for books and 15% for records and music.

Raja that stars his brother Jayam Ravi, Tamannaah, and Shaam, who reprises his role from Kick, in lead roles, and an ensemble supporting cast including Prabhu, Suhasini, Vadivelu, Santhanam, and Sanchita Shetty, among others playing pivotal roles. This is a remake of the 2009 Telugu film, Kick starring Ravi Teja and Ileana D'Cruz. The film features a soundtrack composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, whilst S. Thaman's original score has been reused. The film, produced by Raja's father Mohan and to be distributed by Sun Pictures, released on 23 July 2010 and it released to mixed and negative reviews.Review-1. Sify.com (2 December 2012). Retrieved on 2016-12-03.Review-2. Movies.rediff.com (23 July 2010). Retrieved on 2016-12-03. Thillalangadi depicts the story of Krishna (Jayam Ravi), a brilliant student who has excelled in all aspects of life but loves to have a 'kick' in his life and would do anything just to experience this \\"kick\\". Plot Krishna (Jayam Ravi) is a happy-go-lucky youth who excels in every field but always does strange and dangerous things to obtain a certain \\"kick\\" ‚Äì a thrill or excitement that he craves. One such activity is secretly double- crossing his childhood friend Dass (Sathyan) while helping him elope. At this point, he meets Nisha (Tamannaah), who is shocked at his recklessness and writes him off as crazy. Krishna sets his sights on Nisha and woos her in a very unorthodox way; he begs her not to fall in love with him. After a host of comical situations involving Krishna's caring but easygoing parents (Prabhu and Suhasini), local thugs (John Vijay and Mayilsamy), and an ever-present comic relief Jackson (Vadivelu), Nisha accepts Krishna's love. However, she sets a condition: Krishna must stay in a well-paying job (he had resigned from other jobs due to lack of \\"kick\\"), and only then will she agree to marry him. Krishna accepts but soon resigns again for the same reason and tries to hide it from Nisha. When Nisha finds out, she breaks up with him and leaves him for good. Some months later, Nisha's parents arrange for her to meet a prospective suitor in Malaysia. Though reluctant, she meets the suitor Krishna Kumar (Shaam), a tough but honest policeman. She narrates the story of her affair with Krishna, and Krishna Kumar reveals that he is tracking a dangerous thief who has stolen large amounts of money from wealthy (mostly corrupt) politicians. At Malaysia, Nisha, her sister Ammu (Sanchita Shetty), and Jackson run into Krishna again but learn that he has lost his memory and cannot remember his past life. Nisha sees this as an opportunity to start their relationship again from scratch. However, it is revealed that Krishna is not really suffering from amnesia; he has faked his condition by convincing an amnesiac Paul (Santhanam) that he is a doctor, and tricked him into diagnosing his condition falsely. Nisha is upset but realizes that it was done due to his love for her, and she has hidden her own feelings from him. They reconcile. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the thief whom Krishna Kumar has been tracking is Krishna. His motives are simple; he steals ill-gotten money from politicians to pay for operations of children suffering from cancer. After manipulating various people, such as Vannai Vasanthi (Nalini) and Karuppu (Ganja Karuppu), and stealing from them, he is finally caught in the act by Krishna Kumar. Krishna is still unfazed, celebrating his failure at a street party. He dares Krishna Kumar to catch him in his final crime: stealing money from MLA Rajaraam (Radha Ravi). After many harrowing stunts, Krishna pulls it off successfully. Krishna Kumar is demoted from his job for his failure and is shocked to learn that his replacement is Krishna, who promises to \\"guard\\" Rajaraam's remaining money. Knowing what is in store for the politicians, Krishna Kumar leaves with a new respect for his foe.

Raja for the first time. The soundtrack album features 7 songs, two of which have been reused from the original version, composed by Thaman, as per Raja's wish. The lyrics are penned by Na. Muthukumar and Viveka. The audio was released on 2 July 2010 at the Sun TV studios and premiered on Sun Music in the evening. The background score was taken from the original, scored by Thaman. It comprises the first working together of two legendary singers K.S.Chitra and Shreya Ghoshal for the first time. This duo got a nomimation for best Playback Singing on Filmfare Awards South.  Production  = Development = After the Telugu film Kick, directed by Surender Reddy and starring Ravi Teja, Ileana D'Cruz and Shaam in lead roles, which was released in early May 2009, went on to become highly successful at the box office, 'Editor' Mohan, father of M. Raja and Jayam Ravi, purchased the remake rights for the Tamil version, paying an \\"astronomical amount\\", less than one month later. While Mohan himself would produce the film, Mohan's elder son, M. Raja, was made the director, directing again his brother Jayam Ravi, who would later bag the lead role in the film. It is, noticeably, the fifth \\"remake project\\" of this combo, featuring 'Editor' Mohan as the producer, M. Raja as the director and Jayam Ravi as the lead actor, after Jayam, M. Kumaran Son of Mahalakshmi, Something Something ... Unakkum Enakkum and Santosh Subramaniam. = Casting = For the lead role, played by Ravi Teja in the original version, several popular actors, including Vijay and Madhavan were considered and approached. As per reports, this film was planned to be Vijay's 51st film, which, however, turned out to be not true. Finally, Jayam Ravi was roped in for the role, teaming up once again with his father and brother. The lead female role, originally played by Ileana D'Cruz, was eventually won by Tamannaah. Initially, the crew had planned to sign Ileana for the same role in Tamil as well and approached her, but her father is said to have refused the offer as he didn't want his daughter to play the same role again. Also actress Bhanu, who had starred in the films Thaamirabharani and the very recently released Azhagar Malai, was approached for the role. However, she, too, reused the offer as she felt the role was too glamorous and she wouldn't fit the role. Whilst all his earlier remakes had the actress, who played the role in the original film, in the Tamil version as well, M. Raja, for the first time, was not able to sign the actress of the original Telugu version. Meanwhile, Shaam, who played a vital role in the Telugu version, took up the same the role in Tamil, whilst Prabhu Ganesan was roped in for a \\"significant role\\" and Vadivelu and Santhanam were roped in for the film's comedy portions. Prabhu Ganesan would be playing the role of Ravi's father, which was played by Sayaji Shinde in the original version. It was said, that yesteryear actor Karthik Muthuraman was initially considered and approached for the role, before Prabhu Ganesan was finally confirmed. Suhasini Mani Ratnam was roped in to enact Ravi's mother character. Unlike in Raja's earlier remakes, which all had music scored by the composer who scored the original version and the same songs as well (except for M. Kumaran Son Of Mahalakshmi), composer Yuvan Shankar Raja was roped in for the musical score this time, replacing Thaman, who composed the music of Kick. Apart from Vadivelu and Santhanam, the film stars an array of comedians such as Livingston, Mayilsamy, Kanja Karuppu, Manobala, Thyagu and Sathyan as well. = Filming = The film was formally launched on 19 August 2009 at AVM Studios. The first shot, featuring Jayam Ravi and Tamannaah, was directed by S. Shankar, with actor Vijay giving the inaugural clap shot. The launch was attended by many prominent people from the Tamil film industry as Tamil Film Producers Council chief Ramanarayanan, KRG, Abirami Ramanathan, S. A. Chandrasekhar, R. B. Chowdhary, Ram Kumar, Kasthuri Raja, PL Thenappan, actor Karthi and actress Kushboo Sundar among others. The film was shot at various locations, including Chennai (India), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Bangkok (Thailand) and Singapore. The crew, including director Raja, Jayam Ravi, manager Senthil, cinematographer B. Rajasekar and art director Milan had been looking for locations in Malaysia in August 2009, after which the film shooting began. At first, shooting was held in Chennai for nearly 20 days, following which the crew flew to Malaysia, where a major portion of the film was to be shot, where the original film was shot as well. By mid-November, the crew had completed a 30-day schedule in Malaysia. The shoot in Malaysia involved an action sequence, filmed by three cameras simultaneously, which was shot on busy roads with special permissions from the local police authorities and a song sequence featuring Ravi and Tamannaah. Shooting was held also at the famous Petronas Twin Towers and on the Singapore-Malaysian railway line.

In late January 2010, a special song (\\"Solpechu Ketkadha Sundari\\"), widely publicized as the \\"360 degree song\\" was shot. It was filmed using a Nero motion control camera that revolves on a 360 degree angle set, which was handled by an Australian specialist Scott and would later look like a single shot. This song, choreographed by Shobi, which would feature 15 Jayam Ravis and 5 Tamannaahs, was completed in around 45 hours, on which alone nearly Rs. 75 lakhs was said to be spent.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter novel series. Ginny is introduced in the first book Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as the youngest sibling and only girl in the Weasley family. She becomes Harry's main love interest and eventually marries him at the conclusion of the series.  Character development  Ginny Weasley is a pureblood witch born on 11 August 1981, the seventh child and only daughter of Arthur and Molly Weasley. . She attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and was sorted into Gryffindor house, along with the rest of her family. According to J.K. Rowling, \\"the backstory with Ginny was, she was the first girl to arrive in the Weasley family in generations, but there's that old tradition of the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter and a seventh son of a seventh son, so that's why she's the seventh, because she is a gifted witch. I think you get hints of that, because she does some pretty impressive stuff here and there\\". Over the course of the series, Ginny becomes a strong witch who shows herself to be independent and capable, fighting alongside Harry on more than one occasion as he battles against the Dark Arts. In a joint interview with The Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet, Rowling revealed that she \\"always knew\\" that Ginny and Harry \\"were going to come together and then part.\\" The author explained that, as the series progresses, Harry, and by extension the reader, discovers that Ginny is in fact the ideal girl for Harry. Rowling stated that Harry \\"needs to be with someone who can stand the demands of being with Harry Potter, because he's a scary boyfriend in a lot of ways.\\" By the later part of the series, Ginny and Harry \\"are total equals\\" and \\"worthy of each other.\\" The author also commented that she enjoyed writing the \\"big emotional journey\\" that both characters go through, and that she really liked Ginny as a character.  Appearances  Ginny first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when Harry encounters the Weasley family at King's Cross station and they help him to reach Platform 9¬æ. After realizing Harry's identity, Ginny asks her mother if she can board the Hogwarts Express to see him., chapter 6 Ginny is a first-year student in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, in which she develops a crush on Harry and is sorted into Gryffindor. During the climax of the story, it is revealed that she opened the Chamber of Secrets, and is attacking Muggle-born students while being possessed by Tom Riddle's old school diary. Lucius Malfoy had slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron in Flourish and Blotts prior to the term. She has little involvement in Prisoner of Azkaban, though she is studying at Hogwarts throughout the book. In Goblet of Fire, her role was larger as she attends the Quidditch World Cup and the Yule Ball with Neville Longbottom and can be seen in background appearances. In Order of the Phoenix, Ginny had \\"given up on Harry months ago\\" (though this is merely a ruse as Hermione previously advised her to pretend to not be as interested in Harry and go out with a few other boys so Harry would eventually notice her), chapter 16 and has a boyfriend, Michael Corner, whom she met at the Yule Ball. When Umbridge punishes Harry with a \\"lifetime\\" Quidditch ban, Ginny replaces him as Gryffindor Seeker. During the last part of the book, Ginny breaks up with Michael due to his sulking over Ravenclaw's defeat in the Quidditch Cup final, later replacing him with Dean Thomas. She joins Dumbledore's Army and is one of five members who accompany Harry in his attempt to rescue Sirius Black from the Department of Mysteries. Towards the end of this book Ginny participates in the battle inside the Ministry of Magic, but is forced to withdraw from the action due to a broken left ankle., chapter 35 In Half-Blood Prince, after she casts the Bat-Bogey Hex on Zacharias Smith, Professor Slughorn respects her magical abilities enough to invite her to join his \\"Slug Club\\". Ginny becomes a permanent member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Chaser, and substitutes for Harry as Seeker when Severus Snape puts him in detention during the Quidditch Cup final. After witnessing Ginny kissing Dean in an empty corridor, Harry has an angry internal reaction. This reaction surprises him and upon reflection, he realizes his attraction to Ginny. Since Ginny's older brother Ron vocally objects to Dean going out with his sister, Harry fears his reaction would be the same, if not worse, with him. Ginny's relationship with Dean ends altogether in April following an accidental nudge from Harry under the effects of Felix Felicis, which Ginny interprets as Dean unnecessarily trying to help her through the portrait hole., chapter 22 Ginny and Harry share their first kiss after Gryffindor again won the Quidditch Cup defeating Ravenclaw, thus initiating their relationship. This does not alter Harry's relationship with Ron as he had feared, and they are able to enjoy their relationship for a peaceful few months. After Dumbledore's death, Harry ends their relationship as he fears his love for Ginny would place her in danger. Propelled by the revelation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are leaving to seek the remaining Horcruxes in Deathly Hallows, Ginny kisses Harry in her bedroom, and they realize that they both still have intense feelings for each other. She returns to Hogwarts for her sixth year, where she works with Neville and Luna on reuniting Dumbledore's Army. As Ron is on the run with Harry and Hermione, Ginny is forced to go into hiding with her family. Though underage, she takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts despite her mother's and Harry's disapproval., chapter 31 After Harry's supposed death, she, Hermione, and Luna take on Bellatrix Lestrange, who nearly strikes Ginny with a Killing Curse, infuriating Molly Weasley to the point of intervening and slaying Bellatrix herself. In the epilogue, set 19 years after the events of Deathly Hallows, Harry and Ginny have three children: James, Albus and Lily. Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ginny and Harry are married, news articles and other sources treat it as a fact. Rowling elaborated on Ginny's future after the release of the book, saying that after leaving Hogwarts, she joined the Holyhead Harpies and, after spending a few years as a celebrated player, retired to become the senior Quidditch correspondent at the Daily Prophet, and to start a family with Harry. In the play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Ginny must help Harry reconcile with their wayward son Albus Severus Potter, and references to events in previous books are mentioned. Her job at The Daily Prophet is briefly mentioned when Draco accuses her of promoting suspicion against former Death Eaters, but she states that her articles are purely sport-related.  Characterization  = Outward appearance = She has typical Weasley family traits: flaming red hair (which she wears in a long mane) and a freckled complexion. She is of petite stature, commented on by several characters, and has bright brown eyes like her mother. When she blushes (which was often around Harry Potter in the early years of their friendship), she goes a shade of red that matches her hair. When in a highly emotional state she is known to acquire a \\"hard, blazing look\\". = Personality = Ginny is forceful, independent and often speaks her mind. She has an energetic, lively personality; having feelings for Harry, she became shy and withdrawn in his presence, during the first few years of their friendship. According to Harry, growing up with six older brothers toughened her up. Ginny is not afraid to stand up to anybody, friends and enemies alike. Notably, she stands up to Draco Malfoy on their first meeting in Flourish and Blotts when he insults Harry in Chamber of Secrets. She even stands up to Hermione, her close friend, in defence of Harry's use of the Sectumsempra curse. When describing Ginny, J.K. Rowling notes she is \\"tough, not in an unpleasant way, but gutsy\\", also describing her as \\"warm and compassionate\\". Ginny was very popular during her time at Hogwarts, and drew attraction by numerous boys. Ron in particular felt that Ginny was \\"too popular for her own good\\". = Magical abilities and skills = Ginny is a talented witch. By the time she was 14 could conjure a corporeal Patronus Charm, which took the form of a horse. She is also a gifted flier and Quidditch player, in particular having scored \\"seventeen goals\\" during a Quidditch practice. Ginny was adept at the Bat-Bogey Hex, which drew her to the attention of Horace Slughorn, and her subsequent invitation to the Slug Club.  Portrayals  Bonnie Wright played Ginny Weasley in all eight films of the Harry Potter film series. Wright voiced the character in the Order of Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 video games. Wright has described the character of Ginny as \\"outgoing, friendly and confident.\\" In an interview with The Telegraph prior to the release of Order of the Phoenix, Wright revealed that she got the role because her brother had read the books and told her she reminded him of Ginny, and recommended that she audition for the part. Ginny was voiced by Victoire Robinson for the Chamber of Secrets game, and by Annabel Scholey in Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Bonnie Wright lent her voice to her character in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and acted as a playable character in certain missions. Poppy Miller was cast as the adult Ginny in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Family tree Reception Ginny's pivotal role in Chamber of Secrets was compared by Dave Kopel, citing John Granger's book, to a morality play like John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. He describes the final scene, in which Harry descends to the eponymous Chamber of Secrets to rescue Ginny, saying \\"In the climax of Chamber of Secrets, Harry descends to a deep underworld, is confronted by two satanic minions (Voldemort and a giant serpent), is saved from certain death by his faith in Dumbledore (the bearded God the Father/Ancient of Days), rescues the virgin (Virginia Weasley), and ascends in triumph. It's Pilgrim's Progress for a new audience.\\" This quotation predates Rowling's revelation that Ginny's full name is Ginevra, not Virginia. In popular culture In the dystopian science fiction film The Darkest Minds, two of the main characters compare their relation to that of Ginny and Harry's, in a scene Noah Berlatsky describes as \\"a moment of meta-critique that‚Äôs just as likely to make the audience wince as smile.\\". The film itself was widely panned by critics, Berlatsky himself calling it \\"flat [and] boring\\".

Stanley published in 2000. A follow-up to his earlier The Millionaire Next Door, Stanley draws upon research of America's affluent to examine the ideas, beliefs and practices of the segment of the financial elite. His findings are contrary to common belief, noting for example that high-wealth Americans typically use little or no consumer credit and tend to avoid conspicuous consumption of high-cost or high-status items. While The Millionaire Next Door focused on those with a net worth of at least USD$1 million, The Millionaire Mind emphasizes those with a net worth of at least USD$10 million. The book debuted at #2 on the New York Times Bestseller list on February 18, 2000 and received press and reviews from Fred Barnes, Katie Couric and Donald Trump.Time line of author's achievements Summary Following up the bestseller The Millionaire Next Door, The Millionaire Mind analyzes the common environmental and lifestyle factors that preceded and resulted in this researched segment's ability to accumulate wealth. The book raises the following questions: What success factors made them wealthy in one generation? What part did luck and school play? How do they find the courage to take financial risks? How did they find their ideal vocations? What are their spouses like and how did they choose them? How do they run their households? How do they buy and sell their homes? What are their favorite leisure activities? Stanley's research on how the average American millionaire attained financial success are based on in-depth surveys and interviews with more than 1,300 millionaires. Personal details from this research are shared in the book include memories from their school days, personal thoughts on being \\"the smart kid in the dumb row,\\" making difficult financial decisions, selecting a vocation and spending habits. Reception A review for Bainvestor gave the book a mixed reception, writing that it was an improvement on The Millionaire Next Door due focusing more on why high-wealth people have certain beliefs or habits and providing a good guide to those interested in accumulating wealth, but the flaws included too much editorializing from Stanley and a lack of emphasis on entrepreneurs which the reviewer suspected were underrepresented in Stanley's sample.The Bainvestor Tom Butler-Bowdon's review of The Millionaire Mind summarized the book as somewhat repetitive, but wrote: \\"here are a multitude of revealing facts and ideas besides, including the five 'foundation stones' of financial success most often mentioned by millionaires, enjoyable case histories and anecdotes of specific millionaires.Commentary by Tom Butler-Bowdon from the book 50 Success Classics Trent Hamm of The Simple Dollar wrote that The Millionaire Next Door was probably superior overall for general-audience readers, but that The Millionaire Mind had the advantage of \\"focus[ing] on what I like to call 'life management' skills more than financial planning, which might be of interest to you if you‚Äôre looking for behavioral aspects of how millionaires act.\\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/review-the-millionaire- mind/ Jim Lippard, a telecommunications professional and blogger, gave the book a negative review: \\"This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data‚Äîsuch as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.\\" Donald Mitchell, author and finance consultant, criticized The Millionaire Mind saying, \\"because of the way the sample was selected, you won't get much variety...[and that a] control group is essentially missing....

Background In 1983, former group member Nash the Slash proposed a future double bill tour with FM, as the two artists seemed to share a common audience. FM's best known previous album was Black Noise which he made with them in 1977. But they had not yet found a replacement for Ben Mink who had replaced Nash in 1977, and then left the group in 1983. Nash resolved the problem by rejoining the band, although work on a new album, even in its demo phase, did not begin until May 1984.Lost in Space liner notes Con- Test has the same band line-up as Black Noise. FM's former record company, Passport Records, ceased operations in 1984.Cameron Hawkins interview at Blacknoise site Nash had been signed to Quality Records as a solo artist in 1983, and was about to release his solo album American Band-ages, which the proposed double bill tour was to promote. He was able to use his association with Quality to get FM signed to the label as well. The double bill concept was retained, with Nash playing a solo set as the opening act for most FM concerts from 1983 to 1989. Former group member Ben Mink also appears on the album, albeit as a guitarist. Title and artwork The album was titled Con- Test after the group ran a contest to come up with something that \\"FM\\" might stand for, and its cover art featured fine print listing several hundred submissions including Fluent Monkeys, Flunk Math, Fashion Magazine, Free Money, Forgiven Mistake, Facing Mecca, False Mammaries, and so on. (One intriguing entry is \\"Framed Mulroney\\" which would appear to reference the scandals surrounding then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney; however, these incidents did not occur until years later.) Despite the absence of pictorial graphics, the cover art was credited to surrealist painter Robert Vanderhorst, who has frequently collaborated with Nash the Slash on multi-media presentations\\"Two Artists\\". twoartists.ca.

Releases The album was initially available on Quality Records in 1985 (catalogue number SV-2138), but the label ceased operations in 1986, after more than 35 years of business. They had been Canada's biggest domestic label in the 1950s and 1960s. MCA Records picked up the reissue rights for Con-Test, as well as Nash's American Band-ages in 1986, but the abrupt change in record labels led to a near-absence of promotion for both records. Duke Street Records would release FM's next album, Tonight on vinyl and CD. This was FM's first CD release. The CD edition included five bonus tracks taken from Con-Test (tracks 1 to 4, and 6).Tonight album info at Blacknoise site This acquisition of the rights to Con-Test led to a CD edition of the full album on Duke Street in 1987, but Duke Street did not reissue it on vinyl.

Gibson's original source material was The Story of My Life, the 1903 autobiography of Helen Keller. The play was adapted for the screen twice before, in 1962 and 1979. The film is based on the life of Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan's struggles to teach her. The film premiered on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney on November 12, 2000. Plot In the 1880s, Anne Sullivan, and her efforts in working with young Helen Keller. The movie focuses on Anne's struggle to draw Helen, a blind and prelingually deaf girl out of her world of darkness and silence. Helen has been unable to communicate with her family except through physical temper tantrums since an illness took her eyesight and hearing from her at the age of 19 months old. She is allowed to eat other people's food with her hands, knock over or break items, and basically do whatever else she desires. All of this while being looked at with pity by her family. Her family loves her, but they are all convinced she is a dumb, soft-brained, and savage child with the intelligence of an animal who will never learn anything. She is barely pacified with candy when she throws a tantrum, and is headed toward mental institutionalization in an asylum when Anne enters her life as Helen's parents' last-ditch effort to avoid the inevitable. Plagued with vision problems of her own and orphaned at a young age, Anne has the right mix of steeliness, empathy and patience to turn her young student's behavior around and teach her language. Anne's job as Helen's teacher is made more difficult by Helen's imperious plantation-owner father, Captain Arthur, and her overly soft-hearted mother, Kate, when they doubt her authority and challenge her methods. Anne's goal is to not just teach Helen to behave but to give her gift of communication. Using sign language and signing the letters to spell words in Helen's open palm, Annie makes large strides toward improving Helen's behavior. After two weeks of living alone with Helen in a small house on the Keller family plantation, Annie is still unable to reach a breakthrough with Helen when her mandated time deadline is reached. During Helen's homecoming dinner, she begins to revert to her old ways of misbehavior. Anne takes Helen outside to the pump to refill a water pitcher she spilled during one of her tantrums, and the long-awaited breakthrough is made. Helen makes the connection that the words Anne has been spelling in her open palm are in reality the communicative representation of those things in the physical world around her. The word ‚Äúwater‚Äù is the wet fluid coming out of the water pump. With this connection the doorway for communication is opened to Helen, and she can now survive and thrive in the world through the eyes and ears of others.

He was also a founder of the Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen. Background Danish linguist and language philosopher. Br√∏ndal received a traditional education in philology but showed an early concern for theoretical problems. The Danish philosopher Harald H√∏ffding introduced him to the theory and history of philosophical categories, which was to be the basis of his theory of structural linguistics. This background made him receptive to the ideas of the prestructuralists (such as Antoine Meillet) during his studies in Paris (1912‚Äì1913). He read Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique g√©n√©rale immediately after its publication as he was proofreading the final version of his sociologically oriented thesis on language history (Substrater og Laan i Romansk og Germansk, 1917). Elements from Saussure were footnoted in his book.  University professor  In 1928, Br√∏ndal was appointed professor of Romance languages at the University of Copenhagen, where he taught until 1942. Louis Hjelmslev and Br√∏ndal soon became the main figures in Danish structural linguistics. Br√∏ndal was in close contact with the Prague Linguistic Circle, especially Roman Jakobson, and was active in establishing the Copenhagen Linguistic Circle in 1931. He founded Acta Linguistica with Hjelmslev in 1939. The basic problem Br√∏ndal addressed in his linguistics was the relationship between thought and language. He elaborated a universal grammar that united linguistics and logic along the principles of modern structural linguistics. For Br√∏ndal, Saussure's structural linguistics was such an attempt. The grammatical doctrine of Br√∏ndal is outlined in his major work, Ordklasserne (1928), and in ‚ÄúLangage et logique‚Äù (1937) and ‚ÄúLinguistique structurale‚Äù (1939), both reprinted in Essais de linguistique g√©n√©rale (1943, with Br√∏ndal's annotated bibliography). His universal grammar was supposed to contain all the principles for the deduction of the specific elements of language at different levels and for their relations to nonlinguistic facts, as far as those elements and those relations could express the relation between language and thought. Both the universal and the language‚Äêspecific grammars contain four dimensions: morphology, syntax, symbolic, and logic. The two latter dimensions cover the linguistic expression and the linguistic content, respectively. Although a convinced structural linguist, Br√∏ndal never defended the idea of language as a purely immanent structure. His favorite image of language is of it as a geometry by which we turn the world into meaning and, in doing so, act upon both our own position and the structure of the world. This indissoluble relation between language and reality, subject and object, mind and matter is our reality. To be valid, the theory must answer the question of how human beings relate to the world through a linguistically determined consciousness, not merely describe an immanent formal structure. The core of Br√∏ndal's theory is a reinterpretation of Aristotle's philosophical categories. From this outset, Br√∏ndal proposes a synthesis of classical and modern linguistics in an ambitious attempt at comprehending human reality on the basis of language universals, integrating the concepts of the logic and the linguistic philosophies of Scholasticism, the school of Port‚ÄêRoyal, G. W. Leibniz, and Wilhelm Humboldt as well as Edmund Husserl's phenomenology and the relational logic of logical positivism. Br√∏ndal's work on a universal grammar focuses on morphology and merely sketches semantics (Praepositionernes theori, 1940) and syntax (Morfologi og syntax, 1932). He deals only sporadically with phonology and phonetics‚Äîthat is, the symbolic dimension in his theory. Br√∏ndal was not particularly concerned with the concept of sign. His ultimate purpose was to find the basic features of language that maintained it as an intentional phenomenon in the phenomenological sense used by Franz Brentano and Husserl. He saw the essence of language as object oriented and constitutive of the human relation to the world. But Br√∏ndal's concepts derive from the same philosophical context as the concept of sign and are primarily the Aristotelian categories‚Äîsubstance, quantity, quality, and relation‚Äîrevised to referred to the four generic categories relatum, descriptum, descriptor, and relator. These categories are the basic elements for the construction of a grammar. The requirements of structural linguistics helped Br√∏ndal to define the categories in necessary and sufficient interrelationship for morphological and syntactical purposes. But he also developed a set of specific relative categories, especially symmetry, transitivity, and connectivity, from the logical relations of modern logical theory, mainly for semantic purposes. All the categories articulate different ways of relating objects and consciousness. Furthermore, both set of categories are organized according to a series of structural principles derived from the doctrine of language as a structure of differences and similarities. Like his concept of universal grammar and the concept of intentionality, Br√∏ndal's idea of structural law is influenced by Husserl's Logische Untersuchungen (1900‚Äì1901), an influence reinforced by his discussions with Jakobson on Husserl's concept of founding (Fundierung), which establishes the hierarchical relationships between the elements of a totality. Every element of language is integrated in the grammatical structure on a qualitative and a quantitative basis: qualitatively, it is defined by the double dichotomy of morphology versus syntax and symbol versus logic; quantitatively or formally, it is defined by the structural principles for differences and similarities between elements. Thus, the defining notions of Br√∏ndal's doctrine cover that area which in other theories is defined by notions developed in connection with the sign. In Ordklasserne, Br√∏ndal tries to characterize the specificity of a given totality (the morphology of a language) from the presence and absence of its constituents (the word classes). This analysis is made on the basis of two structural principles: the principle of symmetry, which says that every system of word classes has a tendency to balance manifest contrasts, and the principle of continuity, which says that every system of word classes has a tendency to realize elements of mediation between manifest contrasts. These principles are employed to determine the possible or necessary manifestation or non‚Äêmanifestation of word classes in the grammar of a given language in relation to the total inventory of word classes in the morphology of the universal grammar. Later, Br√∏ndal improved his analysis of structural regularities in generalizing them to include all parts and levels of grammar. When developing the principle of symmetry, Br√∏ndal sets up six forms of relation, which indicate the formal possibilities of the manifestations of a given element: positive, negative, neutral, complex, positive‚Äêcomplex, and negative‚Äêcomplex. These forms were applied by, among others, A. J. Greimas (1917‚Äì1992) in his structural semantics, following the generalizing intention of Br√∏ndal. Br√∏ndal also developed the principle of continuity to include the two interdependent concepts of compensation and variation. They are logically inferior to the forms of relation and the categories, and they presuppose the existence of elements already defined qualitatively by the categories and quantitatively by the forms of relation. On this basis, they create a link between the qualitative and the formal characteristics of the grammatical units: if, in a given language, a grammatical element (e.g., a word class) is formally defined as complex, then the internal differentiation of the class will be more restricted than the internal differentiation of an element of less complex definition (positive, negative, or neutral). This is called the principle of compensation. If, in a given language, two elements or groups of elements receive almost the same qualitative or formal definition (e.g., nouns and adjectives, prepositions and prefixes), then the internal differentiation of the two elements or groups of elements will be different. This is called the principle of variation. These two structural regularities are set forth in greatest detail in Praepositionernes theori. Bibliography and More Information  * Brandt, P. A., ed.

There were three batches, the first being made in 1978-1980 and being distinctive from the others due to a \\"pit\\" in the front end, the second one being made between 1980-1985, and the third one made from 1985-1992, featuring red-silver instead of yellow paint from delivery. The trains used on the system are made up of various trainsets (RamƒÉ ElectricƒÉ de Metrou) connected together (Tren Electric de Metrou). Each trainset is made up of two permanently connected train-cars (B'B'-B'B' formation) that can only be run together. Normally, 3 two-car sets are coupled together to make a complete six-car formation. Between 1994 and 1996, 42 cars (21 two-car sets) were refurbished by FAUR and Electroputere for service on Line M3, however for unknown reasons the refurbishment project was abandoned and these trainsets are currently preserved at Berceni Depot. These trains were distinguished by a blue livery, and featured new technical equipment. An attempt to build more intermediate coaches to allow for a 3-car x 2 formation was abandoned in 1995. In 2000‚Äì2003, all remaining Astra IVA coaches were refurbished and equipped with new ATO and ATP signalling systems, allowing for partial driverless operation especially on Line M4.

It was released on October 20, 2009 for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, and Wii. The game features cartoonish super-deformed versions of the Marvel Comics superhero characters, as seen in the Marvel Super Hero Squad toy line by Hasbro, as well as the television show made by Film Roman and Marvel Animation for Cartoon Network. Gameplay Marvel Super Hero Squad is split into two parts: Adventure Mode and Battle Mode. In Adventure Mode, there are 6 chapters for each hero: Iron Man, Silver Surfer, Hulk, Wolverine, Falcon and Thor. In the character selection, and the level players are playing, there is the main character, then the player gets to pick their own superhero, and they have a large amount of choices. In each level, they have to defeat a wave of enemies and achieve their target (Ms. Marvel tells them what to do). If it's a boss level, it is similar to the Battle mode although what the player has to do is either achieve 5 points, 7 points or 10 points in order to defeat him. Battle Mode is a free-for-all fighting mode. The player makes a new profile, then they either have two options: Versus Mode or Squad Mode. If it is Versus Mode, they pick their character they want to play as but if it's Squad Mode, Player 1 picks two characters and Player 2 picks the other two characters. Then in the Options section, the player picks how many points they can achieve in the battle: 5, 10 or more. Then they go and play the battle. Once finished, they can play again with different characters or go back to the main menu. Plot A.I.M. soldiers The Soldiers cover an Infinity Fractal. Doctor Doom plans to get the Infinity Fractal so he can make the Infinity Melder (a small version of the Infinity Sword). Then the Super Hero Squad intervene and destroy the fractal into pieces and one large chunk of it is stuck in MODOK's forehead. Iron Man tells the Super Hero Squad to find all 6 missing pieces of the fractal. Doctor Doom says that he can't let those super heroes get the fractals first. Iron Man introduces to the team a new invention called: The Stark Shard Locator and Monitor (SSLAM for short). So the team get into action and they find the 6 missing pieces of the fractal. When they've collected all the 6 missing pieces of the fractal, the Mayor of Super Hero City congratulate them for their heroics. The civilians cheer for them then the Mayor reveals the fine works of art of the superheroes. Then Dr. Doom stands in one of them. Iron Man says it's the real Dr. Doom. The people scream. Dr. Doom shock-blasts the superheroes then unleashes his secret army (which is Modokbots). Doctor Doom blames MODOK. The team put on Stark Industries Mind Control Nullifying Belt Buckles and they have to defeat all the Modokbots. Once they've finished defeating Dr. Doom with the Infinity Sword, he's defeated and Ms. Marvel with the helicarrier takes him in. Iron Man congratulates the superheroes for their hard work. Development Marvel Super Hero Squad marked the first game to be developed from a licensing agreement between Marvel Comics and THQ.  Reception  The game was received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to Metacritic. Sequel A sequel titled Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet was released November 16, 2010 with many modifications made. The first game's developers were changed to Griptonite Games, and the consoles the game would be played on changed; the game was still for Wii and Nintendo DS, but PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable consoles were replaced by PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. Another sequel was produced afterwards, requiring a uDraw GameTablet.

On 3 September 1939, the United Kingdom declared war on Nazi Germany after the German invasion of Poland, which started the European War. The British did not assist Poland by land or sea but RAF Bomber Command flew several missions against German targets. A number of these air raids were directed at Kriegsmarine (German Navy) warships in German ports to prevent their use in the Battle of the Atlantic. With the front lines static between September 1939 and May 1940, a period known as the \\"Phoney War\\" set in, with little fighting on land or in the air. At sea, German U-boat (submarine) forces were taking a considerable toll on Allied shipping. The Air Ministry decided to launch an attack on German surface ships to prevent them supporting the U-boats in the North Atlantic. On 18 December 1939, a force of three RAF bomber squadrons was sent to engage German ships in the Heligoland Bight and sink or damage as many as possible. Originally 24 Vickers Wellingtons took off. Two turned back owing to engine trouble before reaching German airspace. The German reaction was slow, but eventually they scrambled fighter aircraft to intercept. Just over 120 aircraft, 80‚Äì100 German and 22 British, were involved but only 44 German fighters made contact with the British bombers. The Germans inflicted more damage on the RAF than the Luftwaffe received but the battle's influence on both sides' strategy was profound. The battle led the RAF to abandon daylight missions in favour of night bombing as daytime casualties were too high. In the build-up to the war, the RAF had adopted the mantra that \\"the bomber will always get through\\" but in daylight the Heligoland battle had shown this was not the case and it forced a reappraisal of bombing operations.Chorley 2007, p. 17. The failure of the raid led the Luftwaffe to believe its base in Germany proper was invulnerable to enemy attack. This belief was reinforced with the success of the Wehrmacht in 1939‚Äì1941, which meant that opposing air forces were pushed too far away for effective bombing attacks on the German homeland. The Germans' neglecting their day fighter force had serious strategic consequences in later years. By the time the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL; Luftwaffe High Command) had begun organising an air defence to combat the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) strategic bombing campaign, they were already engaged in a war of attrition for which they were not prepared. This oversight was one of the contributing factors in the defeat of the Luftwaffe in the Defence of the Reich campaign. The Battle of the Heligoland Bight was later described as \\"amongst the most important actions of the entire war\\". Background =RAF strategy= Before the outbreak of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars without the need for naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through.Holmes 2010, pp. 9‚Äì18. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. The RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were those that were within the industrial region of the Ruhr. The Netherlands and Belgium wished to remain neutral and refused to allow the RAF to establish bases, to fly deeper into Germany. They also forbade overflying by British bombers to and from Germany. After the outbreak of war, the French refused to allow RAF bombers to bomb German cities from French airfields. The French felt secure behind the Maginot Line but their air force did not possess the modern bombers to attack the Luftwaffe. French fighter forces were not yet ready for an all out defensive campaign against the Germans either. A fear of retaliation was the main French reason. The only recourse was to fly missions directly from Britain and only ports or coastal cities in northern Germany were within easy reach. This state of affairs suited the British, in particular, the Admiralty. The most immediate threat to the Allies during the Phoney War period was the U-boat. Some German submarines had been sent to sea before the British declaration of war. Once war was declared, the U-boats began operations against British ships that were bringing in supplies from North America and areas of the British Empire. sank the battleship at Scapa Flow in October 1939, with the loss of 786 crew. As a consequence the Admiralty pressed for the RAF to concentrate its efforts on RAF Coastal Command rather than a strategic bomber force. This was debated within the British establishment well into 1941. In keeping with a request from the United States of America to avoid the bombing of civilian targets, the British formulated the Western Air Plan 7B (WAP 7B), which planned for attacks on German warships. The Germans also complied with the American request, albeit only after 18 September 1939, when victory in Poland was assured. German ships were legitimate targets and, at sea or in port, were far enough away from civilian areas to avoid unnecessary casualties. The Plan revolved around their elimination to prevent their use as supplements to the U-boat fleet.Richards 1995, p. 13.Caldwell and Muller 2007, pp. 34‚Äì35. =3 September ‚Äì 17 December= To fit in with this strategy, the initial plans of the RAF involved raids against German shipping on receipt of the results of aerial reconnaissance. This was attempted on 3 September, when a Bristol Blenheim (flown by Flying Officer Andrew McPherson of No. 139 Squadron RAF)‚Äîon a reconnaissance flight over the North Sea‚Äîspotted a large naval force in the Schillig Roads off Wilhelmshaven. The radio failed and an attack could not be launched until McPherson returned to base, when 15 Handley Page Hampdens and nine Vickers Wellington bombers were sent against the German ships. The weather was poor and the bombers failed to find any targets.Richards 1995, pp. 1‚Äì2. A similar attempt was made on 4 September, when McPherson again spotted warships off Brunsb√ºttel, Wilhelmshaven and in the Schillig Roads. The radio failed again and no attack could be launched until McPherson's return. A force of 10 Blenheims from No. 110 Squadron RAF and No. 107 Squadron RAF along with five more from 139 Squadron and eight Wellingtons of No. 149 Squadron RAF took off to locate the German warships , and , which some aircraft found.Holmes 2010, p. 20. No. 149 Squadron was not prepared for war. At least one of the crews‚ÄîFlying Officer (F/O) Bill McRae‚Äînearly took off without a bomb load; looking in, he noticed the bomb bay was empty. On the way to the target, Squadron Leader Paul Harris ordered his gunners to test their weapons. They all failed and he was heading into German territory defenceless. Not wanting to turn back on his first raid, he pressed ahead.Holmes 2010, p. 21. The same targets were attacked by 9 Squadron later in the day, in and around Brunsb√ºttel.Holmes 2010, p. 25. Results were poor with five Blenheims and two Wellingtons lost and only minimal damage caused to the German warships.Richards 1953, pp. 38‚Äì40.Richards 1995, pp. 26‚Äì28. Admiral Scheer was hit by three bombs that failed to explode, while the light cruiser ‚Äînot one of the priority targets‚Äîwas present and also damaged by a Blenheim that crashed into the forecastle of the ship.Richards 1995, p.28. The crash killed 11 sailors and injured 30.Holmes 2010, p. 26. II./Jagdgeschwader 77 (II JG 77; II Wing, Fighter Group 77, Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher) took off from Nordholz Airbase and intercepted 9 Squadron. Feldwebels Hans Troitzsch and Alfred Held each claimed a victory and Leutnant Metz another.Holmes 2010, p. 23. These aircraft from No. 9 Squadron were the first RAF aircraft to be shot down by enemy fighters during the war and Troitzsch was most likely to have been the first enemy pilot to shoot one down. Another four Blenheims of No. 107 Squadron were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The Germans believed their air defences had established an effective defence from Allied attack. Use of the early Freya radar had given the German fighters eight minutes warning of their approach.Homles 2010, pp. 27‚Äì38.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 31. The delay between spotting German warships and the arrival of the bombers was considered to be too great, and it was decided to carry out reconnaissance in force, with formations of bombers being sent out over the North Sea to find and attack German warships. Their orders forbade them from attacking ships in port, infringing neutral airspace or even attacking German warships escorting merchant ships.Richards 1953, p. 42. A patrol on 29 September resulted in five Hampdens being shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s of II./JG 77 but an attack by 24 Wellingtons of 149, 38 and 115 squadrons on 3 December was more successful, claiming a German minesweeper sunk (confirmed by German archives), while defensive fire from the Wellington gunners repelled attacks by German fighters, shooting one down for no loss.Richards 1995, pp. 35‚Äì36. The German pilot shot down was future German ace G√ºnther Specht. He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF.Holmes 2010, p. 32. The German ships were the Brummer and the minesweeper M1407 both sunk by unexploded bombs passing through the ship. A German report stated the attack was cleverly executed from out of the sun and delivered to avoid the nearby civilian areas.Holmes 2010, pp. 35‚Äì36. An armed reconnaissance by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December resulted in five being lost as the formation, at very low level because of the low cloud base, was engaged by fighter aircraft and anti- aircraft guns. The RAF believed that none of the lost Wellingtons had been shot down by fighters and so maintained faith in their defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations.Richards 1953, pp. 44‚Äì45. This summation was odd considering that several of the surviving bombers had damage from small- arms fire. The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory.Holmes 2010, p. 43. =German defences= The Luftwaffe's air defence organisation went through a number of changes in the first months of the war. The defence of the northern German ports and vital strategic targets was given to the local or nearest Luftverteidigungskommando (Air Defence Command). In this case the unit responsible for the protection of German warships of the Kriegsmarine was the Luftverteidigungskommando Hamburg (Air Defence Command Hamburg). The system was impractical; the Hamburg air defence district controlled air and ground defences but each was geographically in no position to help the other. There was no combined arms synthesis, meaning that the FlaK arm did not directly support the German defences thereby forming one mass defence. Instead, fighter units protecting the coast were held there, with Kriegsmarine FlaK units, while the Hamburg air defence artillery was held too far inland. The Luftwaffe fighters and FlaK units were located too far apart to coordinate.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 38. Coordination was not helped by the poor relations between the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine Commanders-in-Chief, Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring and Gro√üadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder. The system required both services to work together but it produced co-operation difficulties. A solution to the problem was twofold. Fighter units defending the North Sea coast were subordinated to Luftgaukommando XI (Air District Command 11) in Hanover. These fighter units would function as an autonomous fighter command or Jagdfliegerf√ºhrer (Fighter Flyer Leaders). The command of Fighter Command unit was given to Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher, a former commander of II./Jagdgeschwader 77. Schumacher had served in the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy) during the First World War and as an officer cadet had seen combat at the Battle of Jutland. It was hoped with his naval background and easy personality it would ease any difficulties with naval service cooperation. Schumacher and his counterpart in the Navy were of the same rank, so each lacked authority over the other, an arrangement that stifled unity of command. Forces involved =Luftwaffe= The Messerschmitt Bf 110 was a formidable bomber destroyer.Breffort and Jouineau 2009, p. 48. Schumacher was given a new command, Stab./Jagdgeschwader 1 (Command./Fighter Group 1, or JG 1), sometimes referred to as JG Nord (Fighter Group North) or JG Schumacher. In addition to the Bf 109D and E variants, the force was also equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110. The lack of action during the Phoney War period meant that these aircraft, usually in demand by offensive air fleets (Luftflotte), were available for defensive roles. Stab./JG 1 controlled all the following Gruppen (groups; wings in RAF parlance) which had a combined strength of 80‚Äì100 aircraft: * II./Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77) commanded by Hilmer von B√ºlow-Bothkamp * II./Tr√§gergruppe 186 (Carrier Air Group 186; TrGr 186) which was officially attached to Zerst√∂rergeschwader 1 (Destroyer Wing 1; ZG 1) but placed under Stab./JG 1 for defensive duties under Major Heinrich Seeliger * 10. (Nacht)./Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) under Staffelkapit√§n (Squadron Leader) Johannes Steinhoff * I./Zerst√∂rergeschwader 76 (ZG 76) under the command of Hauptmann G√ºnther Reinecke, and 2 Staffel * I./Zerst√∂rergeschwader 76 (ZG 76) under the command of Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Wolfgang Falck. * JGr. 101 was attached to ZG 1 and eventually became II./ZG 1. It was commanded by Major Hellmuth Reichardt. =RAF= Formation 1 Section 1: 1 Richard Kellett 2 Turner 3 Speirs Section 2: 4 Kelly 5 Duguid 6 Riddlesworth Formation 2 Section 1: 7 Harris 8 Briden 9 Bolloch Section 2: 10 Ramshaw 11 Grant 12 Purdy Formation 3 Section 1: 13 Guthrie 14 Petts 15 McRae Section 2: 16 Challes 17 Allison 18 Lines Formation 4 19 Hue-Williams 20 Lemon 21 Wimberley 22 Lewis 23 Thompson 24 RuseHolmes 2010, p. 60. The RAF committed No. 3 Group RAF to the attack. Usually the group consisted of 9 Squadron, 37 Squadron, 38 Squadron, 99 Squadron, 115 Squadron, 149 Squadron together with 214 Squadron and 21 Squadron in reserve. The Group was hastily set up for daylight missions, having been intended for night bombing. The quality of the training was dubious and many of the crews had not been given proper tuition in formation flying. Only 9 and 214 squadrons were able to fly in perfect formations.Holmes 2010, p. 48. To improve formation flying and give crews experience of combat conditions, 37 Squadron practised mock combats with RAF Fighter Command Supermarine Spitfires from RAF Tangmere. Warnings were given by the Spitfire pilots that they could have decimated the squadron within ten minutes because of their poor formation flying and lack of fighter escort but were ignored.Holmes 2010, p. 78. Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett were the only experienced combat leaders but Kellett had not flown with 9 or 37 Squadrons as a group and had never had a chance to practice formation flying or bombing with them. He had not been given the time or opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets, whether as a group, squadron or even as flights. Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do in the event of fighter attack. He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced.Holmes 2010, p. 54. For the 18 December mission, 24 Wellington Bombers from 9, 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to Kellet. The British bombers flew in a diamond shape formation.Holmes 2010, p. 61. Battle =Target= On the morning of 18 December 1939, The Times of London published the story of the Battle of the River Plate and the demise of and a few hours later RAF Bomber Command attempted to sink another major warship. In accordance with Operational Order B. 60 of 17 December, the targets were German warships either in port or at sea. The RAF bombers were ordered to overfly the Heligoland Bight and the port of Wilhelmshaven, attacking ships but avoiding civilian living quarters, merchant shipping or land itself.Holmes 2010, pp. 56‚Äì57. =Bombers en route= A Wellington Mk I of No. 149 Squadron as flown on this raid, seen in 1940 The first Wellington, N2960, took off from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls; 9 Squadron took off from the nearby RAF Honington, formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the rendezvous and caught up with the main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040¬∞ true, as far as latitude 55¬∞ north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. As they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly, turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft.Holmes 2010, pp. 56‚Äì59. Reaching the German‚ÄìDanish border at 55¬∞N 05¬∞E, they turned south. The formation headed towards Schleswig-Holstein and then planned to turn due west to Wilhelmshaven. The move was designed to initiate the attack from the east, through the \\"back door\\". The plan worked, as the bombers arrived without being intercepted but the southward journey had given the Germans a one-hour warning, as the Freya radar had picked up the bombers off the coast. As the bombers passed down the coast, anti-aircraft artillery fire from ships and harbour defences was noted. Once in the target area they also came under heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire from Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven. Ships near Schillig Roads also opened fire. The bombers replied with their machine guns to throw the gunners off. German fire was at the correct height but exploded behind the bombers. Soon after, the formation was over Wilhelmshaven harbour, with Gneisenau and Scharnhorst at anchor beneath them. The ships were too close to shore and Kellett chose not to risk dropping bombs to avoid civilian casualties.Holmes 2010, pp. 62‚Äì64. Kellett‚Äîcommanding the formation‚Äîhad been ordered to attack at minimum altitude (about ). The belief that the greatest danger would come from anti-aircraft fire, not German fighters, had by then become part of RAF operational doctrine.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 39. Poor Luftwaffe administration meant the German defence took time to get the information from their radar sites. Major Harry von B√ºlow-Bothkamp‚Äîcommanding II./JG 77‚Äîstated that it was the naval Freya, rather than Luftwaffe early warning sites that gave the alert. Owing to this, the RAF made landfall without interception. The first air engagement occurred an hour after the Luftwaffe Freya made the initial report. As Kellett was taking off, Schumacher was dismissing any idea that the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, pointing to the Heligoland Bight. As soon as he did so he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von B√ºlow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know; about 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication.Hooton 2007, p. 79. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system but the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.Holmes 2010, pp. 67‚Äì70. =Aerial engagement= The target area. Kellet's force approached from the east over the Jade Estuary and towards Wilhelmshaven. At 13:10, the RAF formation flew over the mud flats to the west of Cuxhaven and Weserm√ºnde and came under fire from flak positions 214, 244 and 264. As Kellett turned west towards the Jade Estuary and over Wilhelmshaven anti-aircraft units 212, 222, 252, 262 and 272 opened fire. Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and all the other naval ships in the dock opened fire in support. In the distance, at Schillig Point, the bombers could see German fighters taking off from a camouflaged airstrip. In a quick briefing, the JG 1 commander had told his pilots to make a beam attack as it was a blind spot for the Wellington. A stern attack was dangerous, as the gunners could then target an attacking fighter with a coordinated and concentrated cone of fire. One weakness also noted was that early types of Wellingtons lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. This meant if the German fighters hit the wings, the bomber was liable to burn.Holmes 2010, pp. 70‚Äì71. Unworried by the Luftwaffe, 149 Squadron was the only section to drop bombs on the ships in Wilhelmshaven harbour. Six bombs fell and the results were unknown. It was all the RAF had to show for its first major raid on a German target. As the bombers emerged from the anti-aircraft barrage, the RAF formation was disorganised. Kellett's and Harris's formations were intact, but Squadron Leader Guthrie was ahead of his No. 9 Squadron and No. 37 Squadron at the rear was straggling. Its commander, Squadron Leader Hue-Williams, was struggling to catch up with the main formation and was forging ahead of his formation without keeping it together. Other members of Hue-Williams's squadron increased their speed to keep up with their leader.Holmes 2010, p. 65. Oberleutnant Johannes Steinhoff flying with Bf 109Ds of 10.(Nacht)./JG 26 took off escorted by a Rotte (pair) from II./JG 77. At 13:30, they attacked one group after the anti-aircraft fire lifted. The Bf 109s claimed seven bombers, with Steinhoff claiming two. The first kill was credited to Unteroffizier Heolmayr.Holmes 2010, p. 71. At 13:40, a Rotte of Bf 110s from ZG 76, led by Hauptmann Wolfgang Falck, claimed four bombers. Falck's aircraft was severely damaged, forcing him to disengage but he managed to glide back to base and make a \\"dead-stick\\" landing without power. Unteroffizier Fresia also made two claims. Fresia's second victim was Flying Officer Allison.Holmes 2010, p. 72. Harris came under attack from a Bf 109 piloted by Oberleutnant Johann Fuhrmann, who failed to hit the bomber in beam attacks. He then tried a stern attack, against earlier advice, only to get shot down. Fuhrmann managed to land in the sea a few hundred yards from the island of Spiekeroog. Witnesses on the beach saw him attempt to swim to shore only for Fuhrmann to drown.Holmes 2010, p. 75. It is likely he was shot down by Aircraftman Second Class Gouldson from Riddlesworth's Wellington.Holmes 2010, p. 163. During the battle a Bf 110 piloted by Oberleutnant Gordon Gollob shot down and killed Guthrie of 9 Squadron. Hue-Williams (37 Squadron) was also shot down, possibly by Hauptmann Reinecke. Soon afterwards, the Germans suffered a casualty when Leutnant Roman Stiegler crashed into the sea in pursuit of Flying Officer Lemon and was killed.Holmes 2010, pp. 76‚Äì77. At the same time, Jagdgruppe 101 claimed two more bombers. Bf 110s from ZG 76 had also attacked the bombers claiming five more. Among the German claimants was Helmut Lent who was credited with two victories.Held and Nauroth 1982, p. 15. After landing at Jever from a patrol, Lent took off to intercept. He engaged Herbie Ruse's Wellington, killing most of the crew. The Wellington was pouring black smoke and Lent broke off believing it about to crash. Lent then pursued Thompson's Wellington, which crashed just off the coast of Borkum. Lent's third claim was not granted: he attacked and shot down Wimberley's aircraft but because the aircraft was already badly damaged and judged to be about to crash, Lent was refused the victory and Stab./JG 1's Geschwaderkommodore Schumacher was given the credit. Schumacher also shot down Pilot Officer Lewis's aircraft, close to Borkum. At 13:45, the German fighters‚Äîat the limit of their endurance‚Äîreturned to base.Holmes 2010, pp. 78‚Äì81.Weal 1999, pp. 21‚Äì22. By 14:05, the other bomber formation was beyond interception range and the last shots were fired. Aftermath =Overclaiming by both sides= The German fighter crews claimed 38 bombers shot down, against actual RAF losses of 12 aircraft. The gunners in the British bombers claimed twelve German fighters and twelve severely damaged.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 40.Treadwell 2003, pp. 29‚Äì31. German casualties amounted to three Bf 109s destroyed, two severely damaged and two Bf 110s severely damaged, a case of overclaiming by both sides. Seven Bf 110s and one Bf 109 suffered light damage. Johann Fuhrmann and Roman Stiegler were the only pilots to die in this action; Dietrich Robitzsch from Jagdgruppe 101, wrote-off a Bf 109 but was uninjured; Feldwebel Hans Troitzsch (Bf 109) and Leutnant Gustav Uellenbeck (Bf 110) were wounded. British aircrews also claimed between sixty and eighty fighters engaging in combat over the Heligoland Bight. To back up their claims, the Luftwaffe insisted that 44 bombers were in the air, which was later increased by OKL to 52. Some hours later these claims were reduced to 34 but months later the reports were analysed and reduced to 27 \\"confirmed\\" victories. This was still over twice the number that was shot down and five more than the size of the formation. German historians have claimed that official British figures were tampered with to hide losses but careful examination of the records reveals no deception. Obituaries from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission record the identity of all service personnel who died during the war and have no known grave; as would be the case for airmen lost at sea. No airmen were reported missing that day from squadrons other than 9, 37 and 149.Holmes 2010, p. 83. =British assessment= The tactical assessment of both sides was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure as a result of poor formation flying and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks were needed. These tactical considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept. On 22 December, an unsigned 3 Group report stated: > There is every reason to believe that a very close formation of six > Wellington aircraft will emerge from a long and heavy attack by enemy > fighters with very few if any casualties to its own aircraft. A loose > formation is however liable to suffer very heavy casualties under the same > conditions.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 41. On 19 December 1939, Air Vice-Marshal Jackie Baldwin reported that Guthrie and Hue-Williams were to blame for racing ahead of their formations and breaking up the defensive formation. Baldwin sent his report to the Bomber Command Commander-in-Chief, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, who replied on 23 December and joined Baldwin in condemning the leaders of 9 and 37 Squadrons for abandoning their flight. Hewitt called this action an \\"unforgivable crime\\", although Harris later stated that this was unfair, as Guthrie and Hue-Williams were untrained and had never faced the enemy before. Harris also blamed 3 Group Headquarters, stating that there had been no planning or liaison between the squadrons. Harris also noted the Group Operations Staff had not provided any formation lessons.Holmes 2010, pp. 98‚Äì99. In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders specifically stated that the formation was not to stay together; each six aircraft section was to be a self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, because more than twelve aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within the section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice; Kellett had followed the notes and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together and lost no Wellingtons.Holmes 2010, p. 100. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative. =German assessment= Tactically, the Germans noted lessons and weaknesses they were already aware of, particularly the nose and tail turrets of the Wellington bombers not capable of giving adequate cover against beam attacks; the bombers' rigid formation flying had favoured the fighters, allowing them to choose the position and angle of attack. The German report also regarded the attempt by the RAF to attack in clear conditions and perfect visibility at altitudes of as \\"criminal folly\\". Schumacher stated that anti-aircraft fire proved effective at breaking up formations and damaging bombers which provided better opportunities for the fighter pilots. After the recent Polish Campaign, the German Army staff analysis had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army General Staff had assessed the problems of leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not do the same and were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffe General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender. The progress of the war from September 1939 to the summer of 1941, with a few exceptions, seemed to validate the Luftwaffe's pre-war focus on the offensive use of its fighter arm. The success of the Luftwaffe in the Norwegian Campaign and the battles of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece had vindicated this method. The Luftwaffe had defended German airspace by driving away enemy air power from Germany's borders and defeating their enemies in their own skies. The occupation of its opponent's territory denied Germany's enemies the bases to attack German targets by air. German daylight defences were rarely tested during this time. This run of events and the knowledge that the RAF was only capable of short penetrations over France in daylight, led the Luftwaffe to believe Germany was invulnerable to attack. To maintain the offensive on the front line, bomber production dominated the air industry while the production of fighters was given less priority.Caldwell and Muller 2007, pp. 45‚Äì46. By the time Germany declared war on the United States, on 11 December 1941, the failure of Operation Barbarossa meant the Luftwaffe's method of concentrating all its resources on the front line was failing. The RAF began its campaign of night bombing in early 1940 and by mid-August 1942, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) entered the air war in force.Caldwell and Muller 2007, pp. 46‚Äì47. Even so, the OKL continued to resist sending its forces to defend Germany and weakening the front lines. It was only in May 1942‚Äîwhen the Luftwaffe faced the USAAF for the first time in daylight engagements and the commencement of USAAF 8th Air Force bombing raids on occupied Europe‚Äîthat the danger of Allied strategic bombing by day gave the OKL cause for concern.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 49. Even by the end of 1942, the measures taken to strengthen daylight anti-aircraft defences remained piecemeal and counter productive. Hans Jeschonnek summed up the attitude of the OKL when he stated that the Luftwaffe could deal with the Western Allies' daylight raids with \\"one\\" fighter wing.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 67. The events of 1943‚Äì1944 would prove this assumption wrong. Adolf Galland‚ÄîGeneral der Jagdflieger (General of the Fighter Force), 1941‚Äì1945‚Äîgave lack of organisation and of planning for air defence as one of the greatest mistakes made by the Luftwaffe during the war.Caldwell and Muller 2007, pp. 286‚Äì287.

Sim√≥n Rodr√≠guez Susarte, commonly known as Sim√≥n Susarte, was a Spanish goatherd from Gibraltar, who in 1704 aided a Bourbon Spanish attempt to seize Gibraltar during the Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar by revealing a concealed path to the attackers which led to the top of the Rock of Gibraltar. Susarte then guided a Bourbon contingent along this difficult trail, aiming to surprise the Grand Alliance garrison in hopes of recovering the town.San Roque Tourism ‚Äì Sim√≥n Susarte Park The Gibraltar siege Following the capture of Gibraltar by an Anglo-Dutch fleet on 4 August 1704 on behalf of the Grand Alliance, the Franco-Spanish Bourbon forces counterattacked by laying siege to the town in September, mainly attacking from the northern slopes of The Rock. The path On 8 October, Sim√≥n Susarte visited the Bourbon Spanish army camp on the north end of the isthmus to advise the troops of a path which led from the east side of Gibraltar's sheer rockface to its summit. This path was known to Susarte and other goatherds from Gibraltar, as they had used it regularly in search of pasture for their goats. The Marquis of Villadarias was in command at the camp; after confirming the veracity of Susarte's account, he decided to send a Colonel Figueroa together with 500 lightly armed grenadiers under Susarte to take the Alliance forces by surprise from the sheer rock face, in conjunction with a general attack to be launched by the remaining Spanish forces. On the night of 9 October, Figueroa's soldiers left the Bourbon lines and began climbing up the jagged eastern slopes of Gibraltar to the \\"Paso del Algarrobo\\" (). The troops spent the night on the east side of the Rock in Fig Tree Cave and Martin's Cave before ascending Middle Hill the next day. The Grand Alliance counter- attack Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt had anticipated the possibility of an attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich.De la Penya i Parell, Narc√≠s Feliu: Anales de Catalu√±a. Vol. III. Barcelona: Juan Pablo Mart√≠, 1709, pp. 526‚Äì527 This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons had the advantage of height, they were trapped against the precipice they had climbed and only had three rounds of ammunition each, as a result of travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle. The Spanish Habsburg force led by Captain Burguy, made up of miquelets and regulars, marched ahead and dislodged the Spanish Bourbon grenadiers from the top of the hill. At the same time, Sandoval, with his remaining regulars and miquelets, charged upon the bulk of the assaulting force from one flank, while Heinrich von Hesse attacked from the other side. Around a hundred of the Bourbon force, including their colonel, were captured. Hundreds more were killed, either by defending fire or by falling off the Rock while attempting to flee. Only a few, including Sim√≥n Susarte, made it back to the Bourbon lines. The English subsequently ensured that there would be no repeat of this episode by blasting away the path used by the Spanish.Jackson, William G. F. (1986). The Rock of the Gibraltarians. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses p.107Hills, George (1974). Rock of Contention: A history of Gibraltar. London: Robert Hale & Company p.193 Existence of Sim√≥n Susarte There is doubt about the existence of Sim√≥n Susarte, since contemporary sources did not mention him at all and the first recorded mention dates to seventy eight years after the event. Susarte's story is first mentioned by Ignacio L√≥pez de Ayala in his Historia de Gibraltar (History of Gibraltar), in 1782, and by Francisco Mar√≠a Montero in his Historia de Gibraltar y su Campo (History of Gibraltar and its Countryside), in 1860. However, the official accounts of the siege published in the Gaceta de Madrid or the letters of Villadarias (which generically talks about l'affaire de la montagne, the mountain affair) do not mention it. S√°ez Rodr√≠guez argues that the lack of any contemporary record of Susarte's involvement does not prove he did not exist but only that his alleged participation was hushed up. A park in San Roque featuring Susarte's statue is named after him.

Count Mih√°ly Cseszneky's father was an inventor and impoverished aristocrat, while his mother was the only daughter and heir of a wealthy grain merchant with extended commercial links throughout Austria-Hungary and the Balkans. After World War I, most of their properties were confiscated by the Serbian government. In the 1930s, Count Cseszneky played an important role in the restoration of the mill industry of Hungary. In September 1943, after the forced abdication of his brother Count Gyula Cseszneky de Milv√°ny et Csesznek, he was proclaimed Grand Voivode of Macedonia, but he did not respond to the offer. During the Nazi German occupation of Hungary he actively helped his former business partner Giorgio Perlasca to save the life of the persecuted Jews. After World War II his properties were confiscated by the Hungarian and Yugoslav Communist regimes. As an aristocrat and prominent supporter of the Civic Democratic Party, he was labelled a class enemy and was deported to a re-education camp, along with his wife and young children.

Most Gada groups also claim descent from the Gaur Brahmin community, and claim Gada is the khadi boli transformation of the original Gauda. The Garha have a caste association, called the Anjuman Garha (Garha association), whose primary purpose is to look after their socio- economic welfare. The association runs schools imparting Social activity and education, as well as a boarding house for poor boys. They live in multi-caste villages, occupying their own quarters.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two editor K S Singh Manohar 2005 page 511 The community comprises mostly peasants called Nambardaar, Padhaan, Zamindaar, concentrated in the Doab region of Uttar Pradesh, and neighbouring Haridwar District of Uttarakhand and Yamuna Nagar district of Haryana. Each of their settlements contains a village-based caste council, known as a biradari panchayat, which acts as an instrument of social control and resolves intra-community disputes. In terms of religion, they are fairly orthodox Sunni Muslims, and have customs similar to other neighbouring Muslim peasant castes. The Garha speak both Urdu and the local Khari boli dialect.

They operated a number of local services, mainly in and around the Scottish Borders, Edinburgh and the Lothians.  History  The company was founded in the mid 1960s by Jimmy Munro, who expanded his hire-car business to include coach operations. The company then began to operate works and schools contracts in and around Roxburghshire. In 1992, the company began its first local route, the contracted Border Courier service, as a joint operation with Austin's of Earlston. Munro's also launched a service linking the Borders General Hospital with Lilliesleaf and Hawick, which ran three days a week. Munro retired in 1998 and, as the family did not want to continue in the business, the company was put up for sale. In July 1998, the company, along with a small garage workshop, yard, and 8 vehicles, was bought by former First Group area managers Donald Cameron and Ewan Farish. The new owners were keen to expand the business, and quickly won additional contracts with both schools and local rugby teams. In July 2000, the company took over routes 29 and 30 (now the 51 and 52, operated by Borders Buses), and routes 65, 66, 67, and 68 from First. A further three contracts were won over the next two years. August 2002 saw further expansion, with Munro's providing new town services, following the closure of First depots in Hawick and Kelso. In 2006, the Scottish Borders Council and the Rural Bus Development Grant subsidised a number of service improvements, including more frequent services from Jedburgh and Kelso to Edinburgh (routes 51 and 52), and a new service from Galashiels to Berwick-upon-Tweed (route 67). Munro's won the contracts to operate both services, although the 67 was later lost to Perryman's (now Borders Buses). Another contract win in 2006 saw Munro's launch a network of routes in and around the towns of Dalkeith and Musselburgh. These services used two Plaxton Primo single-decker vehicles, the only two of their type in Scotland at the time. In June 2009 operation of contracted route 20, linking Kelso to Hawick, was lost to McEwans after five years. A number of journeys on routes 51 and 52, linking Jedburgh and Kelso to Edinburgh, were controversially axed in November 2009.  Demise and closure  In October 2010, the company was fined ¬£3,000, and had the number of vehicles it was licensed to operate cut by the Scottish Traffic Commissioner. The company's routes in Musselburgh and Dalkeith were withdrawn in April 2011, and later replaced by a new route operated by First. In January 2013, Munro's had its operating licence revoked, following an inquiry into the loaning of vehicle operating discs in October 2011 to another operator, Edinburgh Group Travel. Services continued to operate as usual whilst the decision was appealed by the company. Although the appeal proved unsuccessful, Munro's applied for, and was granted, a new licence. In June 2013, it was announced that the reformed company had lost nine contract routes during a retendering process, including the routes linking Jedburgh and Kelso with Edinburgh, and Jedburgh with Galashiels. Munro's ceased trading at midnight on 3 July 2013, with its routes taken over by other operators on temporary contracts.

The genus is also monotypic, as it contains a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies‚Äîdescribed as aquatic or floating puffballs‚Äîare small balls (0.5‚Äì1 mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float on the surface of the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the growth on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium tethers the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada. Taxonomy, classification and phylogeny The family, genus and species were first described in a 1976 publication by graduate students Gustavo Escobar and Dennis McCabe, and undergraduate Craig Harpel who, in the fall of 1974, found the fungus as part of \\"a class project to find and isolate phycomycetes\\". The holotype is located in the University of Washington Mycological Herbarium. An isotype (duplicate of the holotype specimen) is located in the Herbarium of the University of El Salvador in San Salvador. Limnoperdon incarnatum was originally thought to be associated with the Gasteromycetes, an artificial assemblage of species united by the fact that their spores mature inside the fruit bodies and are not forcibly discharged from the basidia. Other morphologically similar genera include the Gasterella of the family Gasterellaceae, and the Protogaster of the family Protogastraceae; however, it was excluded from these genera because of significant differences in spore color and structure, presence of clamp connections, and structure of the basidia. For these reasons the new family Limnoperdaceae was described to contain the new species, and it was classified along the Protogastraceae in the (now defunct) order Protogastrales. More recently, molecular phylogenetics has been used to clarify the relationship Limnoperdon with other fungi. In 2001, David Hibbett and Manfred Binder established the membership of Limnoperdon incarnatum in the euagarics clade, a phylogenetically related group of species traditionally forming the order Agaricales. Additional molecular studies have placed Limnoperdaceae in the pluteoid clade of the Agaricales, a grouping that includes the families Pluteaceae, Amanitaceae, and Pleurotaceae; other studies that used comparisons of ribosomal DNA sequences placed Limnoperdon near the gilled genera Melanoleuca or Resupinatus, of the family Tricholomataceae. A 2007 field study that used molecular techniques to survey aquatic fungal taxa in a small springbrook in Valley Spring, Southern Ontario, Canada discovered many fungal taxa with high genetic affinity to Limnoperdon incarnatum, which suggests that a closely related species may also be common in streams. Description The genus description is similar to the family description, but further specifies that the fruit bodies float, are sometimes embedded in a loose subiculum (a woolly or net-like growth of hyphae), and that the spores are reddish. The fungus has been described as an \\"aquatic puffball\\", although a later review considered \\"floating puffball\\" to be a more apt descriptor. The fruit bodies of L. incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35‚Äì1250 by 200‚Äì450 Œºm. The floating balls are sometimes enclosed in a loose subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18‚Äì30 Œºm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5‚Äì4 Œºm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1 Œºm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy. The gleba is a single chamber, reddish in color, with a cavity that has an oblate spheroid shape. Initially empty, in maturity it is filled with spores that measure 330‚Äì1220 by 180‚Äì420 Œºm. The smooth inner surface of the chamber comprises the fertile spore-bearing tissue (the hymenium). The basidia (spore- bearing cells)‚Äîconspicuous when viewed under the microscope‚Äîare hyaline (translucent), more or less club-shaped, and usually have basal and apical swellings separated by a narrow strip of variable length. The basidia are four-spored, and have inflated sterigmata with a central constriction. The basidia measure 20‚Äì90 (typically 25‚Äì55) Œºm long by 8‚Äì10 Œºm thick. Reddish in mass, the spores are obovate (egg-shaped, with the broad extremity located away from the base), smooth, thick-walled, and measure 11‚Äì16 (typically 12‚Äì15) by 7‚Äì10 Œºm. They have a beaked pedicel that is 2‚Äì4 by 2‚Äì5 Œºm, and a basal germ pore. Habitat and distribution The species was originally discovered floating in petri dishes that contained submerged hardwood twigs previously collected from a marsh next to a playground on the south shore of Lake Union in Seattle, Washington. After the initial 1976 publication, L. incarnatum was reported the following year when Keisuke Tubaki recovered it from wood blocks submerged in brackish water in Japan; scientists Seiya Ito and T. Yokoyama later reported collecting it in Japanese rice paddy fields. Later surveys uncovered the fungus in several localities in South Africa and in freshwater ponds in Canada. Development Escobar grew cultures of the fungus by placing fresh fruit bodies on agar containing growth medium with an extract of horse dung. The tips of the hyphae were used to obtain axenic cultures; the fungus can grow on a variety of media commonly used to grow fungi in the laboratory. Depending on the composition of the growth media, fruit bodies were formed as early as eight days after initiating, when grown at and under dim light. When minute agar blocks containing mycelium were submerged in distilled water, mycelial strands grew towards the water surface and eventually gave rise to floating fruit bodies connected to the parent agar block by strands of hyphae. Mycologist Dennis McCabe studied the development of the fruit body using specimens grown in pure culture. Starting out as a hyphal tuft, the fungus grows into a cup shape before eventually closing in completely to create the spherical structure of the mature fruit body. When the fungus is in the cup stage, the exposed hymenium is immature; typically, spores develop after the fruit body is fully closed. In some cases, the fruit body stops developing at the cup stage while the hymenium continues to mature. This results in a cup-shaped fungus with an exposed layer of basidia bearing normal and mature spores. Limnoperdon incarnatum is a structurally simple fungus, and relatively easy to grow in culture, suggesting it may have potential as a model organism for fruit body development in general. Under the experimental conditions used, fruit bodies matured to produce spores about 72 hours after the fungus started growing. The aborted cups resemble the sporocarps of the cyphelloid fungi, but can be distinguished by their orthotrophic spore attachment and the lack of ballistospory (forceful spore discharge). McCabe and Escobar later suggested that the fungus may have evolved the loss of ballistospory by being compensated with the cup-shaped fruit body closing at maturity. Halocyphina villosa is another small cup- shaped Basidiomycete fungus that has adapted to a marine environment; in contrast to L. incarnatum, however, it starts out with a closed fruit body that later opens up to become cup-shaped. Although it is not known with certainty how the spores are dispersed, they may disperse passively in the water, or a mature spore-containing fruit body may float on the water surface for dispersal. L. incarnatum is homothallic, a mode of reproduction commonly employed by marine fungi that may confer a competitive advantage in marine environments.

Completed in 1887, it had long been the center of Augustinian activity in the United States, and still plays an important role within the province. Today, the church functions as the parish church for St. Thomas of Villanova parish as well as the University Chapel for Villanova University. The church's dual Gothic revival spires have long been symbolic of the University. History The land on which the church and school sit was purchased from the Rudolph family by the Augustinians on October 13, 1841. The intent was to create a center of Augustinian life; an organized program of education for the priesthood, which became Villanova University; and an academy for Catholic boys, which now exists as Malvern Preparatory School. In 1843, Villanova College opened its doors for its first few classes, becoming the center of Augustinian life in the United States, a position it would retain for over 70 years.The Augustinians, Province of Saint Thomas of Villanova . augustinian.org. Retrieved on August 7, 2009. Ground was broken for the church on March 29, 1883. The cornerstone was laid on June 3, 1883, and blessed by Jeremiah F. Shanahan, Bishop of Harrisburg. The building project was begun under the leadership of the Augustinian provincial, Fr. Christopher McEvoy, O.S.A. along with the pastor, prior, and president of Villanova College, Fr. Joseph A. Coleman, O.S.A. The church was completed in 1887 under Reverend James J. Blake, O.S.A.St Thomas of Villanova Church . villanova.edu. Retrieved on August 7, 2009.

Carver, based the twin spires of the church on the south spire of the 13th century French Cathedral at Chartres.Our Parish History stthomasofvillanova.org. Retrieved on August 8, 2009. With no known claim to the contrary, it is assumed that, at the time of its construction, the church's spires were the tallest man-made structure between the Delaware River and Lancaster. Fr. Thomas Middleton, an Augustinian historian, states in his 1893 account of the building of the church that Durang designed the building \\"fa√ßade with two towers, each 18 square feet and 63 feet high, surmounted by eight-sided spires.... Durang created a European-like interior, measuring 60 feet in breadth and 143 ¬Ω feet in length, exclusive of the sacristy, [which includes a] prolongation of the sanctuary, terminating in a large deep apsidal choir for the use of the religious.... The interior woodwork is all of oak including the pews and the stalls in the choir for the fraternity. The choir is divided by six clustered columns supporting groined arches. The side aisles of the nave are divided into six bays, each 15 square feet, also with groined ceiling.\\" The original church contained seven altars: four for the congregation, one in the side chapel of Our Lady of Good Counsel, and the other two in the retro choir. Standing in the center of the sacristy, the main altar was made of Italian polished marble with Indiana stone filigree screen. The altar had two tables and double tabernacles, one facing the congregation, and the other choir. It was not unusual for two masses to be said simultaneously. However, as the number of congregants increased, the filigree screen was removed to enable all to see the service. The church's interior was originally very ornate, in keeping with the taste of the times, including faux marble, gilded columns and walls, and large oil painted murals of \\"The Assumption of St. Joseph\\" and \\"Our Mother of Good Counsel\\". The seven- sectioned dome in the apse contained life-sized paintings in distemper of St. Thomas of Villanova, St. Augustine and St. Patrick, and oval medallions containing busts of the Four Evangelists. Deterioration caused these dome paintings to be replaced in the 1940s. =First Renovation= In preparation for the 1943 centennial of Villanova University, a major renovation of the church was authorized by Augustinian Provincial, Reverend Fr. Sheehan, O.S.A. The d√©cor of the church was changed and simplified, being repainted in tones of ecru and taupe. In 1965, Vatican II posed a significant challenge to churches such as Villanova, as its cruciform design was not easily modified. Fr. Henry Greenlee, O.S.A. oversaw the first significant modifications due to the new doctrine, as he commissioned the installation of a temporary wooden altar which faced the congregation. Later, a permanent, smaller marble altar was installed on a single tier with the marble altar railings removed. =Second Renovation= While many emergency repairs had been made to the church throughout its existence, none addressed the larger problems of structural reinforcement, electrical updating, climate control, and adequate sound systems. Under the direction of Fr. Anthony Genovese, the parish and University communities commissioned a major renovation in 1992. Today the church is nearly entirely whitewashed on the interior, and lit by blue stained glass windows. Much of the original decoration has been preserved, although moved to different locations in the parish and campus. The windows enclosing the nave depict the life of St. Augustine. Today The church today is the center of religious life of Villanova University and the parish of St. Thomas of Villanova. With Rosemont Chapel in nearby Rosemont, Pennsylvania, the parish hosts four weekend masses for the parishioners and three Sunday night masses for the students at the University, as well as daily masses at Corr Chapel on the University's campus.Worshiping at Villanova. villanova.edu.

He is commonly regarded as having performed the first modern psychosurgical operation. Born in Basel, Switzerland, he trained as doctor at the Universities of Basel, G√∂ttingen and Berlin, receiving his medical doctorate in 1860. In the same year he took up a teaching post in the University of Basel and established a private practice in his hometown. He married in 1863 but the following year he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and gave up his practice and relocated to a region south of the Pyrenees in search of a cure. By 1866 he had made a full recovery and returned to Basel with the intention of devoting himself to the study of nervous diseases and their treatment. In 1875, he attained a post at the Waldau University Psychiatric Clinic in Bern and from 1876 he lectured on mental diseases at the University of Bern. Beginning in this period, he published widely on his psychiatric and neurological research findings in the medical press developing the thesis that mental illnesses had their origins in specific regions of the brain. In 1882 he was appointed the medical director of a small, modern and privately run psychiatric clinic at Marin in the Swiss Canton of Neuch√¢tel where he was provided with a laboratory to continue his research. In 1888 he pioneered modern psychosurgery when he excised various brain regions from six psychiatric patients under his care. Aimed at relieving symptoms rather than effecting a cure, the theoretical basis of the procedure rested on his belief that psychiatric illnesses were the result of specific brain lesions. He reported the results at a Berlin medical conference in 1889 but the reception of his medical peers was decidedly negative and he was ridiculed. Burckhardt subsequently discontinued his research activities. Following the death of his wife in 1896 Burckhardt returned to Basel where he established a sanatorium in 1900. He died seven years later from pneumonia. Early life and education Gottlieb Burckhardt was born on 24 December 1836 into a well-known family, the Burckhardt, living in the Swiss city of Basel. His father, August Burckhardt (1809‚Äì1894), was a physician.; His mother was Katharina Jacot (1810‚Äì1843) from Montb√©liard in France.; Burckhardt's parents were married in 1833 and his mother gave birth to seven children prior to her death in 1843. Gottlieb Burckhardt was the third eldest child. In 1844 his father married Henrietta Maria Dick (1813‚Äì1871). She had five pregnancies and three surviving children. Burckhardt attended secondary school in Basel. His medical studies were conducted at the Universities of at Basel, G√∂ttingen and Berlin. In 1860 he was conferred with a doctorate in medicine from the University of Basel. His doctoral thesis was on the epithelium of the urinary tract. As a student, he was described as popular, outgoing and musically talented. Career =Early career, 1860-1888= Painting of the Waldau Clinic, Berne (1921) by Adolf W√∂lfli who was a patient there from 1895 until his death in 1930. Burckhardt worked as physician at the Waldau from 1873 until 1882. By 1860 Burckhardt had established a private medical practice in Basel. In 1862 he completed a post- doctoral habilitation in internal medicine and was granted the position of Privatdozent at the University of Basel. The following year he married Elisabeth Heusler (1840‚Äì1896) and they had eight children together. In 1864, due to a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, Burckhardt was forced to give up his practice and he relocated to a southern locale near the Pyrenees. He recovered fully and published a study of climatic conditions in the region. In 1866 Burckhardt returned to Basel and resolved to study the diseases of the nervous system and their treatment with the new electrotherapies. His interest in this field had been fostered by Karl Ewald Hasse, a noted physician and friend of the Burckhardt family. In 1873 he was elected to the presidency of the Basel Medical Society. Two years later, in 1875, he received a post as a physician to the Waldau Psychiatric University Clinic in Berne; later that year he also published Die physiologische Diagnostik der Nervenkrankheiten (Physiological Diagnostics of Nervous Diseases), a 284-page monograph which detailed the results of his research on the use of electrotherapy for nervous disorders and the conductivity of the nervous system.; ; ; In 1876 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern where he lectured on nervous and mental diseases.; This marks a highly productive period in his career as he became a regular contributor to several medical publications including the Swiss periodical Korrespondenzblatt f√ºr Schweizer √Ñrtze and produced articles on a variety of psychiatric and neurological topics.; In 1877 he published a historical treatment of psychiatric and psychological theories of the functional regions of the brain.; In this article he proposed that there were \\"cortical dispersion centres\\" which were \\"rooted in physiology and anatomy in the brain\\" and that these played a crucial role in the development of mental illness. Burckhardt drew inspiration for his hypothesis from recent advances which had shown the localisation of language faculties in the brain and he believed that mental diseases were also traceable to specific cortical centres. In the application of internal medicine to psychiatry, his research activities extended to an exploration of the relationship between mental illness and bodily temperature, blood pressure and pulse. In 1881 he published on the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption and posited a connection between cerebral oxygen deprivation, pathological brain circulation and mental illness. While at Bern he also successfully submitted articles on the histological preparation of brain cells, sensory aphasia (\\"word deafness\\"), the anatomy of the brain and cerebral localisation and forensic psychiatry. From 1881 until his departure from the Waldau Clinic in 1882, Eugen Bleuler, who coined the term schizophrenia in 1908, served as his medical intern. In August 1882 Burckhardt was appointed as the medical director of the Pr√©fargier, a small but modern psychiatric clinic in Marin in the Swiss Canton of Neuch√¢tel.; ; Prior to his arrival a laboratory was constructed at the clinic so that Burckhardt could continue his research into neuroanatomy and psychophysiology.; ; In February 1884 he presented at the Pr√©fargier asylum his findings on the heredity and the surface configuration of the brain.; He continued to publish on psychiatric and neurological topics such as cerebral vascular movements, brain tumours and optic chiasm, traumatic hysteria, and writing disorders. =Psychosurgery, 1888-1891= Nineteenth- century trephination set similar to that employed by Burckhardt In December 1888 Burckhardt, who had little experience of surgery, performed what are commonly regarded as the first series of modern psychosurgical operations. He operated on six patients under his care, two women and four men aged between 26 and 51 whose condition was deemed to be intractable.; Their diagnoses were, variously, one of chronic mania, one of primary dementia and four of prim√§re Verr√ºcktheit (primary paranoid psychosis). This latter diagnosis was, according to the clinician-historian German E. Berrios, \\"a clinical category that (anachronistically) should be considered as tantamount to schizophrenia\\". Burckhardt's case notes recorded that the patients all exhibited serious psychiatric symptoms such as auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, aggression, excitement and violence. The operations excised regions of the cerebral cortex, specifically removing sections of the frontal, temporal, and tempoparietal lobes. The results were not overly encouraging as one patient died five days after the operation after experiencing epileptic convulsions, one improved but later died by suicide, another two showed no change, and the last two patients became \\"quieter\\". Complications consequent to the procedure included epilepsy (in two patients), motor weakness, \\"word deafness\\" and sensory aphasia. Only two patients are recorded as having no complications.; ; ; The theoretical basis of Burckhardt's action rested on three propositions. The first was that mental illness had a physical basis and that disordered minds were merely a reflection of disordered brains. Next, the associationist viewpoint of nerve functioning which conceived the nervous system as operating according to the following threefold division of labor: an input (or sensory or afferent) system, a connecting system which processed information and an output (or efferent or motor) system. The final assumption of Buckhardt's was that the brain was modular which meant that each mental module or mental faculty could be linked to a specific location in the brain. In accordance with such a viewpoint, Buckhardt postulated that lesions in specific areas of the brain might impact behavior in a specific manner. In other words, he thought that by cutting the connecting system, or second association state of brain's system of communication troubling symptoms might be alleviated without compromising either the nervous system's input or output systems. The procedure was aimed at relieving symptoms, not at curing a given mental disease. Thus, he wrote in 1891: > [I]f excitation and impulsive behaviour are due to the fact that from the > sensory surfaces excitations abnormal in quality, quantity and intensity do > arise, and do act on the motor surfaces, then an improvement could be > obtained by creating an obstacle between the two surfaces. The extirpation > of the motor or the sensory zone would expose us to the risk of grave > functional disturbances and to technical difficulties. It would be more > advantageous to practice the excision of a strip of cortex behind and on > both sides of the motor zone creating thus a kind of ditch in the temporal > lobe.Quoted in Burckhardt attended the Berlin Medical Conference of 1889, which was also attended by such heavyweight psychiatrists as Victor Horsley, Valentin Magnan and Emil Kraepelin, and presented a paper on his brain operations. While his findings were subsequently widely reported in the psychiatric literature, the reviews were unremittingly negative and there was much ill ease generated by the surgical procedures he had performed.; ; He also published the results of the procedure in 1891 in the periodical Allgemeine Zeitschrift f√ºr Psychiatrie und psychischgerichtliche Medicin in an article entitled 'Uber Rindenexcisionen, als Beitrag zur operativen Therapie der Psychosen' ('Concerning cortical excision, as a contribution to the surgical treatment of psychosis'). This paper was his last significant medical publication. Kraepelin, writing in 1893, was scathing of Burckhardt's attempts, and stated that \\"he [Burckhardt] suggested that restless patients could be pacified by scratching away the cerebral cortex.\\" While Giuseppe Seppilli, an Italian professor of neuropsychiatry, remarked in 1891 that Burckhardt's view of the brain as modular did not \\"fit in well with the view held by most [experts] that the psychoses reflect a diffuse pathology of the cerebral cortex and [ran counter to] the conception of the psyche as a unitary entity\\". Burckhardt wrote in 1891 that \\"Doctors are different by nature. One kind adheres to the old principle: first, do no harm (primum non nocere); the other one says: it is better to do something than do nothing (melius anceps remedium quam nullum). I certainly belong to the second category\\". The French psychiatrist Armand Semelaigne responded that \\"an absence of treatment was better than a bad treatment\\". After the publication of his impressive 81 page monograph on the subject in 1891, Burckhardt ended his research and practice of psychosurgery due to the ridicule he received from his colleagues over the methods he had employed. Commenting on his monograph in 1891 the British psychiatrist William Ireland concluded: > Dr. Burckhardt has a firm faith in the view that the mind is made up of a > number of faculties, holding their seats in distinct portions of the brain. > Where excess or irregularity of function occurs he seeks to check it by > ablation of a portion of the irritated centres. He defends himself from the > criticisms which are sure to be directed against his bold treatment by > showing the desperate character of the prognosis of the patients upon whom > the operations were performed ... Ireland doubted that any English psychiatrist would have the \\"hardihood\\" to follow the path taken by Burckhardt. =Later career and death, 1891-1907= Following the death of his wife and one of his sons, Burckhardt left his position at the Pr√©fargier in 1896 and returned to Basel with the intention of setting up a sanatorium.; This plan came to fruition in 1900 when the Sonnenhalde Clinic was opened in Riehen near Basel. Burckhardt served as the clinic's medical director from 1900 until 1904 and he remained a physician at the facility until his death from pneumonia on 6 February 1907. He was a marginal figure within the professional community of his psychiatric peers, attending few medical symposia and conferences in his discipline. However, he is often seen as a precursor to the Portuguese neurologist, Egas Moniz, who performed the first leucotomy, later known as lobotomy, in 1936.; ; Publications       Notes and references =Notes= =Footnotes= =Bibliography=              Online sources  Category:1836 births Category:1907 deaths Category:Swiss neurosurgeons Category:Swiss psychiatrists Category:Lobotomy Category:People from Basel-Stadt Category:University of Basel alumni Category:University of G√∂ttingen alumni Gottlieb ","title":"Gottlieb Burckhardt"},{"id":"23901749","text":"Road Trips Volume 2 Number 4 is a two-CD live album by the American rock band the Grateful Dead.

The name Zarda comes from Persian word 'zard' meaning 'yellow', hence named since the food coloring added to the rice gives it a yellow color. Zarda is typically served after a meal. In the Indian subcontinent, zarda was and still remains a popular dessert on special occasions such as weddings. It is very similar to Sholezard, an Iranian dessert. Often in Pakistan, instead of yellow food coloring, multiple food colorings are added so the rice grains are of multiple colors. Additionally, khoya, candied fruits (murabba) and nuts are an essential part of zarda made at auspicious occasions. There also is a popular use of raisins, and other dried fruits to dish. Dating back to Mughal India, zarda had a variation with an addition of small fried sweetmeat pieces called 'Mutanjan'. This dish was a favourite of Emperor Shahjahan and was often made on his request. This rice dish was made for guests at special banquets.

The autobiography of Kurigalzu is one of the inscriptions which record that he was the son of Kada≈°man-·∏™arbe. Galzu, whose possible native pronunciation was gal-du or gal-≈°u, was the name by which the Kassites called themselves and Kurigalzu may mean Shepherd of the Kassites (line 23. Ku-ur-gal-zu = Ri-'-i-bi-≈°i-i, in a Babylonian name-list). He was separated from his namesake, Kurigalzu II, by around forty-five years and as it was not the custom to assign regnal numbers and they both had lengthy reigns, this makes it exceptionally difficult to distinguish for whom an inscription is intended. The later king is, however, better known for his military campaign against the Assyrians than any building work he may have undertaken. It is now thought, however, that it was he who was the Kurigalzu who conquered Susa and was perhaps instrumental in the ascendancy of the Igehalkid dynasty over Elam, ca. 1400 BC. Conquest of Elam When ·∏™ur-batila, possibly the successor of Tepti Ahar to the throne of Elam, began raiding the Babylonian Empire, he taunted Kurigalzu to do battle with him at D≈´r-≈†ulgi. Kurigalzu launched a campaign which resulted in the abject defeat and capture of ·∏™ur-batila, who appears in no other inscriptions. He went on to conquer the eastern lands of Susiana and Elam, recorded in the Chronicle PChronicle P (ABC 22), tablet BM 92701, column 3 lines 10 through 19. out of sequence and credited to his later name-sake. This took his army to the Elamite capital, the city of Susa, which was sacked, celebrated in two inscriptions found there bearing his name. It is thought that he may have installed as his vassal, Ige-Halki, the founder of the new dynasty. A small agate tablet, bored lengthways to make a pendant, is engraved with nine lines of Sumerian on one side, the other side bearing an older dedication of the mother of king ≈†ulgi of Ur (2029 ‚Äì 1982 BC, short chronology) to Inanna: The tablet was recovered from Elam during Kurigalzu‚Äôs campaign and discovered in a cache of votive inscriptions at Nippur, but was ascribed to Kurigalzu II by earlier historians. Diplomacy =Through correspondence= Bead with cuneiform inscription of Kurigalzu I. Prior diplomatic correspondence is evident, from study of the Amarna letters and includes evidence of dialogue between Thutmose IV and Kurigalzu as attested to by Amenhotep III in his letter, designated EA 1 (EA for El Amarna), to Kada≈°man-Enlil. Tablet EA 1, ‚ÄúThe Pharaoh complains to the Babylonian King,‚Äù BM 029784 in the British Museum, CDLI, ORACC Transliteration line 62, ‚ÄúRegarding the words of my father, you wrote...‚Äù Burna-Buria≈° II reminded Akhenaten in his letter, EA 11, that Kurigalzu had been sent gold by one of his ancestors, Tablet EA 11, ‚ÄúProper escort for a betrothed princess,‚Äù VAT 151 in the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin, CDLI, ORACC Transliteration lines 19 to 20. and, in EA 9, reminded Tutankhamen that Kurigalzu had turned down a request from the Canaanites to form an alliance against Egypt. Tablet EA 9, ‚ÄúAncient loyalties, new requests,‚Äù BM 29785 in the British Museum, London, CDLI, ORACC Transliteration lines 19 to 30. =Through marriage= He gave his daughter to Amenhotep III, who was a serial practitioner of diplomatic marriages with two Mitannite princesses and one from Arzawa in his harem, and who would even later go on to wed Kurigalzu's granddaughter, the daughter of Kada≈°man-Enlil. A Neo-Babylonian copy of a literary text which takes the form of a letter,Tablet VAT 17020, ‚Äúthe Berlin Letter‚Äù, CDLI now located in the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin, is addressed to the Kassite court by an Elamite King and details the genealogy of the Elamite royalty of this period. Apparently, he married his sister to the Elamite king Pa·∏´ir-i≈°≈°an, the son of Ige-Halki, and a daughter to his successor, ·∏™umban-numena. This may have been Mishim-ruh, who is cited in royal inscriptions. The princess went on to bear Untash-Napirisha, the next king who was destined to marry Burna-Buria≈°‚Äô daughter. The author of the letter is thought to be Shutruk-Nahhunte, ca. 1190-1155 BC, who claims descent from Kurigalzu‚Äôs eldest daughter and also wed the eldest daughter of Meli-≈†ipak, the 33rd Kassite king. Unfortunately the letter inserts Nabu-apla-iddina (888 ‚Äì 855 BC) ‚Äúan abomination, son of a Hittite‚Äù, into the narrative in the place one might have supposed that Marduk- apla-iddina I was to appear, the substitution of dAMAR.UTU by dAG being an unlikely slip of the stylus, making a chronological conundrum and this may be the purpose of the ‚Äúletter‚Äù, to denigrate the later king through the tongue of the earlier one. Building works Kurigalzu‚Äôs construction efforts are attested to at no less than eleven Babylonian cities. He was responsible for rebuilding the Ningal Temple at Ur, incorporating fragments of the Ur-Nammu Stela in buildings on the ziggurat terrace, the Edublal-Ma·∏´ of S√Æn buildings, or ‚Äúhouse for hanging up the exalted tablets‚Äù, and the building of the gateway. Door socket from Dur-Kurikalzu He was the first king to build a royal residence bearing his name, a new capital city founded over an older settlement and built around 1390 BC, named Dur-Kurigalzu, or 'fortress of Kurigalzu', in the far north of Babylonia (modern ‚ÄòAqar Q≈´f). It was positioned to protect an important trade route that led east across the Iranian plateau to Afghanistan, the source of lapis lazuli. The 170-foot-high ziggurat of Enlil can still be seen on the western outskirts of Baghdad, with its reinforcing layers of reed matting and bitumen and the remains of three temples at its foot. Rawlinson first identified the site in 1861 from the brick inscriptions. Excavated in 1942‚Äì45 by Seton Lloyd and Taha Baqir, the city covered 225 hectares and included the Egal-ki≈°arra, or ‚ÄúPalace of the Whole World‚Äù, a vast palatial and administrative complex.

A neo-Babylonian copy of a text recording the endowment by Kurigalzu, son of Kada≈°man-·∏™arbe, of a temple of I≈°tar with an estate situated on the Euphrates near Nippur, is known as the autobiography of Kurigalzu and comes in the form of a small hexagonal prismPrism BM 108982 in the British Museum, CDLI. of light-yellow baked clay Plates 6 and 7 show a sketch of the obverse and reverse of this prism. and a fragmentary cylinder.Cylinder NBC 2503 in the James B. Nies Collection, Yale University, CDLI. In it, he takes credit for being the He ‚Äúcaused Anu the father of the great gods to dwell in his exalted sanctuary‚Äù, which is suggested to be referring to the restoration of the Anu cult. The text lacks the linguistic features and script characteristics which would bring one to suppose it is a genuine copy of an ancient inscription and was probably created in late Babylonian times to enhance the prestige of the I≈°tar cult. The extent to which it preserves tradition from the actual events of the reign of Kurigalzu cannot as yet be determined. Other sources Evidence of the stretch of Kassite influence comes to us from a tomb at Metsamor where a remarkable carnelian cylinder seal with a hieroglyphic inscription mentioning the Kassite king Kurigalzu I was found. Situated in Armenia, in the middle of the Ararat valley, Metsamor was an important Hurrian center for metal forging A seal is inscribed nur-[d]-x, son of Kurigalzu, and claims the title NU.√à≈† [d]en.l√≠l, ni≈°akku-priest, which is shared with others, including three governors of Nippur and other princes. He rewarded an individual with this title in a dedicatory cone known as the Enlil-bƒÅnƒ´ land grant kudurru. The precise meaning of this title and the identity of the Kurigalzu, I or II, are uncertain.

It bordered the old Nord-Tr√∏ndelag county as well as the counties of M√∏re og Romsdal, Oppland, and Hedmark. To the west is the Norwegian Sea (Atlantic Ocean), and to the east is J√§mtland in Sweden. The county was separated into a northern and southern part by the Trondheimsfjord. Slightly over 200,000 of the county's population (or around 55%) lives in the city of Trondheim and its suburbs. The Norwegian dialect of the region is Tr√∏ndersk. The region was divided into two administrative counties in 1804. In 2016, the two county councils voted to merge into a single county on 1 January 2018.Hofstad, Sigrun. 2016. Her bankes det for et samlet Tr√∏ndelag. NRK (April 27).  Name  The name S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag was created in 1919. It means '(the) southern (part of) Tr√∏ndelag'. Until 1919 the name of the county was S√∏ndre Trondhjems amt. The meaning of this name was '(the) southern (part of) Trondhjems amt'. (The old Trondhjems amt, created in 1662, was divided in 1804. Trondhjem is the old form of Trondheim.) See also Nord-Tr√∏ndelag  Coat of arms  The coat of arms was from modern times (1983) - but it had old roots: it was the seal of , archbishop of Trondheim 1475‚Äì1510.  Geography  S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag consisted of 25 municipalities and had a total area of . Trondheim is the largest city and the county's administrative center. The broad and long Trondheimsfjord is at the center of this county, although the coastal areas stretch somewhat further north. The mountain ranges Dovrefjell and Trollheimen are located in the south, while the Fosen peninsula is located north of the fjord. The highest mountain is the tall Storskrymten, which is located in the county border between M√∏re og Romsdal, Oppland, and Trondelag. Its longest river is Orkla which runs through Tr√∏ndelag and Hedmark. Several of the best salmon rivers in Europe are located in the county, the largest and most famous being Gaula and Orklaelva. Dovrefjell‚ÄìSunndalsfjella National Park, Forollhogna National Park, Skarvan and Roltdalen National Park and Femundsmarka National Park are located, or partly located, in the county.  History  People have lived in this region for thousands of years (see Rock carvings in Central Norway, N√∏stvet and Lihult cultures and Corded Ware culture). The fertile lowland bordering the Trondheimsfjord was probably the most important power centre in the Viking Age. Oretinget was an assembly hall located alongside the Nid River in Trondheim that served as the coronation place for Viking kings such as Harald Fairhair (865 to 933 AD) and his son Haakon I the Good. Nidaros (the former name of Trondheim) served as Norway's capital during the Viking era up until the early part of the 13th century. Trondheim was the seat of the archbishop for several centuries, and an important pilgrimage destination following the death of St Olav in 1030. R√∏ros, in the southeastern part of the county, is a well-preserved mining town on a mountain plateau, and is a Unesco World Heritage Site.  Economy  Mining in R√∏ros and L√∏kken in Meldal lasted for about 300 years, and Thamshavnbanen, the old electric railway from Orkdal to L√∏kken, is still usable. The constant fires used to crack the rock in the mines demanded vast amounts of firewood; the montane forests on the mountain plateau near R√∏ros still have not fully recovered. Along the coast, fishing has always been important. Farming was and still is important in the whole county, with the most economical important agriculture taking place in the fertile lowland valleys, such as in Melhus, Orkdal, Skaun, Midtre Gauldal, Malvik and Trondheim, but also near the outer seaboard, such as in √òrland and Rissa. The city of Trondheim has always been at the centre of this area, with administrative functions, as well as industry based on agricultural produce, and more recently education, high-tech business and healthcare. Transportation S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag is connected to the other counties by the European Route 6 (E6) which passes by Trondheim and connects Oslo in the south and runs north along the coast and terminates just east of Kirkenes in Finnmark. European route E39 connects S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag to M√∏re og Romsdal. There are two airports in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag: R√∏ros airport and √òrland airport. Trondheim's airport, V√¶rnes, is actually located in Stj√∏rdal in Nord- Tr√∏ndelag. There are local trains that connect several municipalities; there are also trains that connect Trondheim to Oslo, Bod√∏, R√∏ros, and Steinkjer in Norway, as well as Storlien in Sweden. Hurtigruten's coastal liner has daily, early- to mid-morning stops in Trondheim on both north- and south-bound trips. There are also frequent commuter boats that connect smaller communities including some that connect Trondheim to Vanviken as well as other ports of call including: Brekstad; Kj√∏rsvikbugen; Volden, Hitra; and Kristiansund. Additionally, during the summer months larger cruise ships stop in Trondheim.  Climate  The weather is very much decided by the direction of the wind; southerlies and easterlies bring sunny weather, while westerlies bring precipitation with mild weather in winter and cool rainy weather in summer. Northwesterlies bring the worst weather with snow in winter (often sleet or rain on the coast). Average yearly precipitation varies from 2,000 mm in some areas of Fosen, to 850 mm in Trondheim and only 500 mm in Oppdal. The interior areas at somewhat higher elevations have cold winters with reliable snow cover, while the coastal areas have a maritime climate with mild and more windy winters.

The association regards itself as \\"the voice of Ontario's public hospitals\\". History On December 13, 1923 ‚Äì at the request of Dr. Fred W. Routley, the Ontario Director of the Canadian Red Cross at the time ‚Äì a group of hospital workers met at the Toronto Academy of Medicine to lay the foundation for the establishment of the OHA. The 58 attendees consisted of hospital physicians, nurses, superintendents, business managers, trustees and association executives. It was at this meeting that the OHA, as it is known today, was launched. The attendees also agreed that the first OHA convention would be held the following fall. October 2 and 3, 1924, marked the OHA's first convention and annual general meeting attended by 106 registered participants. At this event, there was a lot of discussion on a range of topics from the high costs of hospitalization, to financial problems and a new blood transfusion method. (Source: \\"80 Years of Progress\\", the Ontario Hospital Association) Historical context Canadian historian David Gagan, in a section of the book \\"Health and Canadian society: sociological perspectives\\", discusses the rise of the modern hospital in Ontario from 1880 to 1950, from which the following information is derived. Until the end of the 19th century, Canadian hospitals mainly cared for the indigent, with middle- class patients favouring medical care at home to care in the hospital. New technology ‚Äì laboratories, x-ray machines, hospital child birth, and antiseptic surgery ‚Äì radically transformed hospitals in a short period of time up to the end of the First World War in 1918 and made them more acceptable to middle-class patients. However, these technologies were expensive and the allowance paid to hospitals by government to cover the costs of caring for indigent patients did not meet the actual costs. Since hospitals were still mandated to care for indigents, middle-class patients were charged more and more to subsidize care for the poor. This eventually strained patients' capacity to pay. At that time, hospitals' total income from all sources of revenue ‚Äì including paying patients, municipal and government subsidization, donor contributions ‚Äì were only enough to maintain a static system, not an enterprise that was now improving during a time of medical progress. In 1927, these emerging challenges led the President of the OHA to note that it was neither useful nor realistic to continue in this manner, and the idea of the hospital as a purely charitable endeavor was rendered obsolete. He proposed instead, that the goal of the modern hospital was to provide the best diagnostic and therapeutic facilities available for a fee to patients who paid the full cost of their care. The government's insufficient subsidy for indigent patients transferred the fiscal burden to paying patients (\\"people of moderate means\\") and diverted any additional hospital income to cover the costs of non-paying patients. This was seen as a barrier to medical progress. According to Gagan, the objective was not to deny indigent patients access to hospital care, but to appeal to middle-class self-interest in order to spur statutory changes in government social policy that would explicitly recognize that hospitals were no longer charitable enterprises. Rather, hospitals had become centres for the scientific treatment of diseases among all classes for a fair price in relation to the value of the product and the ability of the consumer to pay for non-profit treatment. The OHA and hospitals wanted a shift from the traditional charitable role of hospitals, to one that was \\"committed to scientific professionalism and recognized the realities of hospital economics\\". In a 1936 study (Ontario Survey of General Hospitals, 1940) undertaken by the Ontario Department of Health during the Depression, it was noted that lengths-of-stay (LOS) for the poor and indigent patients increased, while LOS decreased for paying patients. The report, which was finalized in 1940, concluded that the trend of hospitals returning to their former role as custodial care facilities and municipalities' mounting expenditures on medical care, was a temporary condition. Among the recommendations was to police the hospitals to eliminate waste, inefficiency and long-stay indigent patients. This government rationale was among the factors that drew interest among federal and provincial constituencies which included the OHA, to support the idea of health insurance. In 1943, Prime Minister WLM King created an Advisory Committee on Health Insurance to consult broadly on the issue, which consequently produced the Heagarty Committee Report. In the meantime, private carriers and not-for-profit organizations such as Blue Cross, which was organized by the Canadian Hospital Association, had begun to provide voluntary group hospitalization insurance coverage through employers. \\"The hard times of the 1930s created the momentum behind the establishment of Blue Cross¬Æ in Ontario.\\" By 1956, 50% of Canadians were covered by voluntary private or nonprofit prepayment plans, but public pressure for a nationwide program to protect people from catastrophic health-care costs was growing. On a provincial level, as early as the 1940s, the OHA began to step up its lobbying efforts to government on behalf of Ontario hospitals, primarily for funds (which was a prime function of the OHA since its inception), because of new challenges such as the spiraling costs of health care, which did not match government funding. One of the proposed solutions at the time was universal hospital insurance, which the OHA generally supported. Years later, in 1957, Ontario Premier Leslie M. Frost tabled the Ontario memorandum and proposal on hospital care insurance before the Ontario Legislature. During his speech, he publicly acknowledged a body of experts who helped conduct studies related to this proposal, which included the executive of the Ontario Hospital Association and the Blue Cross. He added that as part of the conditions of implementation, the plan was to be \\"administered by the Ontario Hospital Service Commission, either through the agency of the Blue Cross or by a crown corporation similar to the Blue Cross, and by personnel drawn from the Ontario Hospital Association.\\" \\"In 1959, the Government of Ontario launched the Ontario Hospital Insurance Plan. 600 Blue Cross employees as well as most of its top management team moved over to help guide in the plan's development.\\" On a national level, \\"Medicare developed in two stages. The first was the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Act of 1957, which gave the Canadian government authority to enter into an agreement with the provinces to establish a comprehensive, universal plan covering acute hospital care and laboratory and radiology diagnostic services. Nine years later, the Medical Care Act of 1966 extended health insurance to cover doctors' services. This led to a federal government offer to share, on a grant-in-aid basis, the costs of a Canada-wide plan, on condition that the majority of provinces take part and a majority of the population be covered. By mid-1957, eight provinces indicated that they would join in such a proposal. By 1961 all provinces had hospital plans in operation and 99% of the population was covered. This included coverage for all standard-ward hospital care.\\" Executives Anthony Dale is the current president and chief executive officer, appointed to the position in December 2013.

Limited, 1996. Life Born on May 3, 1864, Erland was a prominent member of the Lee family, who came to the Niagara Peninsula in Canada (then British North America) as United Empire Loyalists in 1792, after the American Revolutionary War. They settled on top of the Niagara Escarpment, and cultivated a prosperous farm. The Lee Homestead, also known as \\"Edgemont,\\" is currently the site of the Erland Lee Museum. Erland Lee is best recognized as the co-founder of the first Women's Institute in the world, along with Janet (Chisholm) Lee, his wife, and Adelaide Hoodless, an advocate of domestic science and women's education. In February 1897, after hearing Hoodless give a lecture at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph- Erland invited Hoodless to deliver a speech at the annual \\"Ladies Night\\" held by the Farmer's Institute of Stoney Creek of which he was an influential member.Erland Lee Museum files Hoodless suggested during this speech that education in domestic science might best be achieved through an organization for women similar to the existing Farmer's Institutes for men. Hoodless (or Erland Lee) then suggested that women interested in discussing the formation of such a group might meet again the following week.Women's Institute Constitution and Minutes, Stoney Creek Charter Branch, 1897. Written by Janet Lee Erland and his wife Janet spent that week inviting and encouraging the women of Stoney Creek to attend this second meeting. On February 19, 1897, 101 rural Canadian homemakers agreed to create a Women's Institute, which would become the largest international rural women's movement ever established.Ambrose, Linda M. \\"For Home and Country: The Centennial History of the Women's Institutes in Ontario.\\" Stoddart Publishing Co.

Erland Lee's political and financial support of the women's group was crucial to its expansion and success, and may be the only reason why the organization was recognized by the Canadian government during a time when women were not considered citizens. Erland Lee was also a member of the Saltfleet Masonic Lodge, Treasurer-Clerk of Saltfleet Township, and a teacher educated at the Hamilton Normal School.

Subaru cars are known for their use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1500 cc. The Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout was introduced in 1972. Both became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most markets by 1996. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012 via a partnership with Toyota, which pairs the boxer engine with rear-wheel-drive. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the WRX, Legacy and Outback XT, Ascent, and formerly the Legacy GT and Forester XT. In Western markets, Subaru vehicles have traditionally attracted a small but devoted core of buyers. The company's marketing targets those who desire its signature engine and drive train, all-wheel drive and rough-road capabilities, or affordable sports car designs. Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or the \\"Seven Sisters\\" (one of whom tradition says is invisible ‚Äì hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI. History = Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI) and Subaru's first cars = Fuji Heavy Industries started out as the Aircraft Research Laboratory in 1915, headed by Chikuhei Nakajima. In 1932, the company was reorganized as Nakajima Aircraft Company, Ltd and soon became a major manufacturer of aircraft for Japan during World War II. At the end of the Second World War, Nakajima Aircraft was again reorganized, this time as Fuji Sangyo Co, Ltd. In 1946, the company created the Fuji Rabbit, a motor scooter, with spare aircraft parts from the war. In 1950, Fuji Sangyo was divided into 12 smaller corporations according to the Japanese government's 1950 anti-zaibatsu legislation, the Corporate Credit Rearrangement Act. Between 1953 and 1955, five of these corporations and a newly formed corporation decided to merge to form Fuji Heavy Industries. These companies were: Fuji Kogyo, a scooter manufacturer; coachbuilder Fuji Jidosha; engine manufacturer Omiya Fuji Kogyo; chassis builder Utsunomiya Sharyo and the Tokyo Fuji Sangyo trading company. Former logo on a Subaru 360 showing six stars in an arrangement similar to the Pleiades open star cluster alt= Kenji Kita, CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries at the time, wanted the new company to be involved in car manufacturing and soon began plans for building a car with the development code-name P-1. Kita canvassed the company for suggestions about naming the P1, but none of the proposals were appealing enough. In the end he gave the company a Japanese name that he \\"had been cherishing in his heart\\": Subaru, which is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster. The first Subaru car was named the Subaru 1500. Only twenty were manufactured owing to multiple supply issues. Subsequently, the company designed and manufactured dozens of vehicles including the 1500 (1954), the tiny air-cooled 360 (1958), the Sambar (1961), and the 1000 (which saw the introduction of the Subaru boxer engine in 1965). 1958 alt= =Later partnerships= Nissan acquired a 20.4% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru's parent company, in 1968 during a period of government-ordered merging of the Japanese auto industry in order to improve competitiveness under the administration of Prime Minister Eisaku Sat≈ç. Nissan would utilize FHI's bus manufacturing capability and expertise for their Nissan Diesel line of buses. In turn many Subaru vehicles, even today, use parts from the Nissan manufacturing keiretsu. The Subaru automatic transmission, known as the 4EAT, is also used in the first generation Nissan Pathfinder. While under this arrangement with Nissan, Subaru introduced the R-2 (1969), the Rex and the Leone (1971), the BRAT (1978), Alcyone (1985), the Legacy (1989), the Impreza (1993) (and its WRX subtype), and the Forester (1997). Upon Nissan's alliance with Renault, its stake in FHI was sold to General Motors in 1999. Troy Clarke of General Motors served as representative to Fuji Heavy Industries on their corporate board. During that time, Subaru introduced the Baja (2003), and the Tribeca (2005). The Subaru Forester was sold as a Chevrolet Forester in India in exchange for the Opel Zafira being sold as a Subaru Traviq in Japan. Also, the Chevrolet Borrego concept was presented in 2002, a crossover coupe/pickup truck being derived from the Japanese-market Legacy Turbo platform. During the brief General Motors period, a badge engineered Impreza was sold in the United States as the Saab 9-2X. An SUV (Subaru Tribeca/Saab 9-6X) was also planned but the Saab version did not proceed, and styling was recycled in the 2008 Tribeca refresh. GM liquidated their holdings in FHI in 2005. Nearly all Saab-Subaru joint projects were dropped at that time, other than Subaru supplying parts for the Saab 9-2x. Toyota Motors bought a little over 40% of GM's former FHI stock, amounting to 8.7% of FHI. (The rest of GM's shares went to a Fuji stock buy-back program.) Toyota and Subaru have since collaborated on a number of projects, among them building the Toyota Camry in Subaru's Indiana U.S. plant beginning in April 2007. Subaru introduced the Exiga in 2008. Toyota increased their share of FHI to 16.5% in July 2008. Subsequently, Toyota and Subaru jointly developed the Subaru BRZ, first sold in January 2012. Toyota sold the BRZ as the Scion FR-S until 2018, where it was renamed to the Toyota 86 due to the discontinuation of Toyota's Scion brand. Around the time of Toyota's increased ownership, Subaru also declared that they would no longer develop their own Kei cars and trucks, instead selling rebadged products from Toyota's Daihatsu subsidiary. This also allowed Subaru, a small manufacturer, to focus on their core of boxer-engined family cars. The last of Subaru's own kei vehicles to be built was the sixth generation Subaru Sambar, which was taken out of production in March 2012 after 54 years of continuous manufacturing in this category. = Marketing = Some of the advertising slogans Subaru has used in the past include: \\"Inexpensive, and built to stay that way\\" (USA 1970s ‚Äì early 1980s), \\"The World's Favourite Four Wheel Drive\\" (in the UK), \\"Plus on y pense, plus on a le go√ªt de la conduire\\" (Literally: \\"The more one thinks, the more one has the taste (or desire, impulse, drive) of driving it\\") in French Quebec,Subaru Legacy Canada sales brochure printed January 1990 \\"We built our reputation by building a better car\\", \\"What to Drive\\", \\"The Beauty of All- Wheel Drive\\", \\"Driven by What's Inside\\", \\"Think, Feel, Drive\\", \\"Love. It's what makes Subaru, a Subaru\\" (USA early 2010s) and currently \\"Confidence in Motion\\" in North America, \\"All 4 The Driver\\" in Australia, \\"Uncommon Engineering, Uncommon Stability, Uncommon Roadholding, Uncommon Sense\\" in the UK and \\"Technology that gives you Confidence in Motion\\" in Southeast Asia. In the 1990s, an ad firm hired by Subaru found the all wheel drive cars were popular among lesbians. The company started including subtle marketing to this demographic. According to Automotive Lease Guide, Subaru ranked second place in vehicles that have the highest overall predicted resale values among all industry and all luxury vehicles for MY 2009. The awards are derived after carefully studying segment competition, historical vehicle performance and industry trends. According to a study done by J.D. Power and Associates for the 2008 Customer Retention Study, Subaru ranked at 50.5%, which was above the national average of 48%. Subaru launched an animation series Wish Upon the Pleiades developed jointly with Gainax. The 4-part mini episode series was released on YouTube on February 1, 2011. It featured a magical girl plot with Subaru as a leading protagonist. Current operations Subaru's corporate headquarters are located in Ebisu, Tokyo. =Manufacturing facilities= Subaru is distinct from many of its Japanese competitors in that as of early 2016 it still made almost 75% of its cars sold internationally in Japan. Subaru's facilities designated to automotive manufacturing are located in ≈åta, Gunma Prefecture, consisting of four locations: Subaru-ch≈ç is where the Subaru BRZ/Toyota 86 is built; having been re-purposed from kei car production, Yajima Plant is where all current Subaru cars are built; Otakita Plant is where commercial kei trucks are built (originally a factory location of Nakajima Aircraft Company); and Oizumi Plant in Oizumi, Gunma Prefecture, is where engines and transmissions are built. Subaru's major overseas manufacturing facility is located in Lafayette, Indiana; the factory is called Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. Due to continued sales growth in North American markets, vehicle production capacity at the Lafayette assembly plant is set to expand to 390,000 vehicles annually. Under the current strategic plan, Subaru will have a total production capacity of 1,026,000 vehicles per year at the end of 2016. =Subaru in Canada= Subaru dealership in Canada In 1976, Canadians got their first exposure to Subaru vehicles when Subaru Auto Canada Limited (SACL) began offering the Subaru Leone. In 1989, the privately owned SACL was purchased by the Toronto-based Subaru Canada, Inc. which, under the guidance of parent company Fuji Heavy Industries, began an expansion process that would eventually see over 100 Subaru Dealers in operation across the country. Subaru Canada, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Subaru Corporation of Japan. Headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, the company markets and distributes Subaru vehicles, parts and accessories through a network of 94 authorized dealers throughout Canada. =Subaru in Asia= In Asian countries outside of Japan, Subaru vehicles, parts and accessories are supplied by Motor Image Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed and Singapore-headquartered Tan Chong International Limited under businessman Glenn Tan. Subaru has entered the Philippine operations started in 1996 under the Columbian Motors Philippines ownership but withdrew in 2000. It returned in 2006 under a new ownership by Motor Image Pilipinas, Inc. Subaru has eleven dealerships in the country: Greenhills, Fort Bonifacio, Manila Bay, Alabang, Davao, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo, Santa Rosa, Batangas, and Pampanga. Subaru has seen popularity in their SUV line-up in the market in recent years. With the Forester and the XV being one of their popular selling models. Subaru once had a presence in South Korea, established in 2009 in Yongsan, Seoul under Choi Seung-dal. Sales started in April 2010 with the Legacy, Outback and Forester as the initial lineup for the South Korean market. They were the fifth Japanese automobile manufacturer to enter after Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi. According to the company, they delayed their entry due to market dominance by Hyundai and Kia. By 2012, Subaru Korea announced that they would discontinue selling 2013 car models due to low sales. On April 23, 2019, Subaru officially opened its production plant in Lat Krabang, Bangkok, Thailand, the plant is a joint venture between Subaru Corporation and Hong Kong-listed Tan Chong International (TCIL), which holds a 74.9 per cent stake. The plant will supply Subaru vehicle to markets in Asia, including Australia and New Zealand. According to media interview with Glen Tan, the plant will have maximum capacity of 100,000 vehicles per year, and up to maximum of 4 models to be manufactured. Current production in 2019 is planned for 6,000 vehicles for Forester model only. =Subaru in the United Kingdom= In 1974 Robert Edmiston was finance director at sports car manufacturer Jensen Motors. When the company went bankrupt, he used a redundancy payout to set up International Motors, which acquired the UK franchise for Subaru and Isuzu. The Coleshill based company is still the parent for Subaru in the UK. =Subaru in the United States= Subaru of America (SOA) was established in 1968 in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania by Malcolm Bricklin and Harvey Lamm and relocated to Pennsauken, New Jersey shortly thereafter. In 1986, SOA relocated to Cherry Hill, New Jersey and Fuji Heavy Industries (now known as Subaru Corporation) acquired full ownership in 1990. In 2018, SOA relocated to a brand new headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. SOA operates regional offices, zone offices and parts distribution centers throughout the United States. SOA also operates port facilities on both the West and East coasts. In 1989 Subaru and then-partner Isuzu opened a joint factory in Lafayette, Indiana called Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, or SIA, which initially manufactured the Subaru Legacy and Isuzu Rodeo. In 2001 Isuzu sold their stake in the plant to Fuji Heavy Industries for $1 due to flagging sales and it was renamed Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. SIA has been designated a backyard wildlife habitat by the National Wildlife Federation and has achieved a zero-landfill production designation (the first automotive assembly plant in the United States to earn that designation). According to the Kelley Blue Book in 2015, two Subaru models Forester and the Outback in the United States had very short inventory time (the time between being received by a dealer to being sold). Motorsports Subaru Impreza WRC Subaru Rally Team Japan led by Noriyuki Koseki (founder of Subaru Tecnica International, STI) ran Subaru Leone coup√©, sedan DL, RX (SRX) and RX Turbo in the World Rally Championship between 1980 and 1989. Drivers for individual rallies included Ari Vatanen, Per Eklund, Shekhar Mehta, Mike Kirkland, Possum Bourne and Harald Demut. Mike Kirkland finished 6th overall and won the A Group at the 1986 Safari Rally. That year Subaru was one of the only manufacturers combining 4WD and turbo after Audi's successful quattro system had been introduced in 1980, but Audi withdrew from the WRC after safety concerns and Ford's serious accident early in the 1986 season. Subaru changed the rally model to Legacy RS for the 1990‚Äì1992 period and took part in the first complete season in the World Rally Championship with the same model in 1993. Modified versions of the Impreza WRX and WRX STi have been competing successfully in rallying. Drivers Colin McRae (1995), Richard Burns (2001) and Petter Solberg (2003) have won World Rally Championship drivers' titles with the Subaru World Rally Team and Subaru took the manufacturers' title three years in a row from 1995 to 1997. Subaru's World Rally Championship cars are prepared and run by Prodrive, the highly successful British motorsport team. Several endurance records were set in the early and mid-nineties by the Subaru Legacy. The Subaru Justy also holds the world record for the fastest sub 1.0L car without a turbo: 123.224 mph average, it was set in 1989. Subaru was briefly involved in Formula One circuit racing when it bought a controlling interest in the tiny Italian Coloni team for the 1990 season. The Coloni 3B's 12-cylinder engine was badged as a Subaru and shared the boxer layout with the company's own engines, but was an existing design built by Italian firm Motori Moderni. The cars were overweight and underpowered and the partnership broke down before the season finished.Subaru Performance magazine version 4.3 With the rise of rally racing and the Import scene in the US, the introduction of the highly anticipated Subaru Impreza WRX in 2001 was successful in bringing high-performance AWD compact cars into the sports car mainstream. Subaru supplies a factory-backed team, Subaru Rally Team USA for Rally America and has won the driver's title six times, most recently in 2011 with David Higgins. Grassroots Motorsports awarded Subaru with the Editors' Choice Award in 2002. On 16 December 2008, it was announced that Subaru would no longer be competing in the World Rally Championships. The decision was made by Subaru's parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI), partly as a result of the economic downturn but also because it was felt Subaru had achieved its sporting and marketing objectives. Mr Ikuo Mori denied that alterations to the WRC technical regulations in 2010 or a rumored deterioration in the working relationship with Prodrive had any impact on the decision. He also said that the possibility of a Subaru car back in the top category of WRC in the future is not zero, but for this moment there can be no assumption of a comeback. Since 2005, Cusco Racing have entered an Impreza and a BRZ in the Super GT championship. In 2008, the Impreza was the first 4-door and first 4WD vehicle to win a race. Starting in 2006, Subaru of America (SOA), as the official distributor of Subaru vehicles in the United States participates in the Subaru Road Racing Team (SRRT) with a Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT Spec-B in the Grand-Am Street Tuner class. In 2010, SRRT campaigns a Subaru Impreza WRX STI in the Grand Sport class. In 2011, SRRT switched from the hatchback to a 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI sedan. In 2011, Mark Higgins used a stock Impreza to set a lap record at the Isle of Man TT course. In 2016, Higgins again broke the record in a modified WRX STI. On 4 May 2012, Subaru Rally Team USA announced that a new rallycross team, Subaru Puma Rallycross Team USA, will participate in the 2012 Global RallyCross Championship season with Dave Mirra, Bucky Lasek, and Sverre Isachsen. They also competed in the 2014 FIA World Rallycross Championship. Also in 2012, Subaru became the naming rights sponsor of the chief domestic road cycling competition in Australia, the National Road Series. The Impreza has won hillclimbs such as the Silverstone Race to the Sky and Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race. Technology and fuel consumption =Diesel= The 2007 Frankfurt International Motor Show saw Subaru introduce a horizontally opposed, water-cooled, common rail turbodiesel using a variable geometry turbocharger called the Subaru EE engine, the first of its type to be fitted to a passenger car. Volkswagen had experimented with this idea during the 1950s and made two air-cooled boxer prototype diesel engines that were not turbocharged. VW installed one engine in a Type 1 and another in a Type 2. The Subaru engine was rated at and with a displacement of 2.0 liters. In March 2008 Subaru offered the Legacy Sedan and Wagon and the Outback Wagon with 2.0 liter turbodiesel in the EU with a 5-speed manual transmission. In September 2008 Subaru announced that the diesel Forester and diesel Impreza will be introduced at the 2008 Paris Motor Show, with Forester sales to begin October 2008 and diesel Impreza sales to start January 2009. The Forester and Impreza will have a 6-speed manual transmission, whereas the Legacy and Outback have 5-speed manual transmissions. United States Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy estimated is: ;City Ranges : : ;Highway Ranges : : =Electric vehicles= In June 2006, Fuji Heavy Industries, Inc. (FHI) launched its Subaru Stella Plug-in electric vehicle which is a kei car equipped with a lithium-ion battery pack. The vehicle has a short range of but it actually costs more than the Mitsubishi iMiEV, at (), including Japanese Government consumption taxes with an exemption of $2,240. It also qualified for a rebate from the Japanese Government of up to $14,200, bringing the price down to $30,660. The vehicle is much like the i-MiEV, with a 47-kilowatt motor and a quick-charge capability, but the two-door mini-car has a boxy shape. FHI set a goal of selling 170 vehicles by March 2010. In Japan, Subaru is currently testing two electric vehicles called the Subaru G4e and the Subaru R1e. The Subaru Hybrid Tourer Concept is a four-seat vehicle with gull-wing doors that combines a 2-liter turbocharged direct-injection gasoline engine with a continuously variable transmission and two axle-mounted motors. A lithium-ion battery pack provides energy storage for the vehicle. In early 2018, Subaru, along with Suzuki, Daihatsu and Hino Motors, joined the nascent EV C.A. Spirit venture to collaborate on electric vehicle technology development. The project was launched by Toyota, Mazda and automotive component manufacturer Denso in September 2017. Subaru was among the few makes lacking any electric models. In the U.S., the short-lived Crosstrek hybrid was on the market only for the 2014 to 2017 model years. In 2018, for the 2019 model year, Subaru unveiled the 2019 model year Crosstrek Plug-in Hybrid, based in large part on technology from shareholder Toyota's Prius Prime platform. The EV range is . It is only available in California and parts of the East Coast. A full EV is in the works and promised in 2020, for 2021 model year. = Electronics = Since the 2005 model year, Subaru has adopted the CAN bus technology for the US and Canada markets. Starting in the 2007 model year, all Subaru vehicles use the CAN technology. Typically, two CAN-buses are used on vehicles: a high-speed CAN running at 500 kbit/s for powertrain communication, and a low-speed CAN running at 125 kbit/s for body control functions and instrument panels. A body-integrated unit (BIU) is used between these two networks. Clarion and Harman Kardon are among the audio, video, and navigation technology suppliers for Subaru products in North America. Clarion announced in 2015 that it was introducing its \\"Smart Access\\" platform, formerly only offered on Clarion's aftermarket products, to the units to be installed in certain Subaru 2015 models in North America. Smart Access is able to work with the driver's smartphone (either iPhone or Android) and allows access to various car-safe apps running on the phone via the car's built-in infotainment screen. Subaru and Clarion have also, with Liberty Mutual Insurance, introduced the \\"RightTrack\\" in-vehicle app which will be able to monitor the driver's habits, make suggestions for safer driving, and possibly offer insurance discounts. In 2008, Subaru introduced their EyeSight driver assistance and safety system. Unlike most such systems, which use radar or sonar sensors, EyeSight uses dual video cameras mounted at the top of the windshield. Depth information is derived from the parallax between two video signals and used to judge the distance to the next vehicle for features such as pre-collision braking and adaptive cruise control. The company has continued to improve the technology, which now includes lane-keeping assistance. EyeSight is now available on most Subaru models (usually in higher trim levels) and is standard on the Subaru Ascent. = Subaru Global Platform (SGP) = Subaru debuted its new chassis design, dubbed the Subaru Global Platform, with the release of the 2017 Impreza. Having spent over a billion dollars on research and development the company plans to extend the architecture to all of its other models, with the exception of the BRZ which is co-developed with Toyota. By incorporating high- strength steel into the chassis updated vehicles will have stiffer bodies that increase safety through greater impact absorption while also improving ride comfort. Another focus of the new platform is modularity, allowing Subaru to reduce development costs by streamlining production throughout its network of facilities. The platform will be able to accommodate a variety of powertrains, including gasoline, hybrid, and fully electric designs. Environmental record USA-spec Subaru Legacy PZEV Subaru claims to have implemented advanced policies which include recycling, reducing harmful emissions, and educating their employees. Their efforts have helped them in their environmental initiatives. The Subaru plant in Lafayette, Indiana (SIA) was the first auto assembly plant to achieve zero landfill status; nothing from the manufacturing process goes into a landfill. The company has developed a recycling plan for the \\"end-of-life\\" of their cars. Most of their modern products use highly recyclable materials throughout the vehicle, in the engine, transmission, suspension and elsewhere in each vehicle leaving Subaru with a 97.3% recycling ratio rate for their end-of-life vehicles. An excerpt from the Subaru website stated \\"In 2006, SIA was awarded the United States Environmental Protection Agency¬¥s Gold Achievement Award as a top achiever in the agency's WasteWise program to reduce waste and improve recycling.\\" The website also stated that \\"It also became the first U.S. automotive assembly plant to be designated a wildlife habitat.\\" Subaru currently offers a Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV) certified Legacy, Outback, Impreza, XV/Crosstrek and Forester models which are available for sale anywhere in the U.S. Subaru PZEV vehicles meet California's Super-Ultra-Low-Emission Vehicle exhaust emission standard. All other models have been certified LEV2.  Subaru vehicles  =Other manufacturers= Subaru has partnered with various manufacturers over time. Below are some of the models sold in Asia and Europe. In Japan they are in the Kei car class with either front or all wheel drive and a straight engine. An article posted by Autoblog on April 16, 2008 stated that due to a corporate investment by Toyota, all Kei cars built by Subaru will be replaced by Daihatsu models beginning in 2010. * Subaru Bighorn (1988‚Äì1993, rebadged Isuzu Trooper) * Subaru Justy (1994‚Äì2010, 2016‚Äìpresent: rebadged Suzuki Cultus (1994‚Äì2003), Suzuki Ignis (2003‚Äì2007), Daihatsu Boon (2007‚Äì2010) and Daihatsu Thor (2016‚Äìpresent).

New statute  Regalia of the Order of Zhukov on the banner of the 39th Separate Railway Brigade of the Southern Military District The entire Russian Federation award system was revamped by Presidential Decree 1099 of September 7, 2010. This major rework included a redesign of the Order and amendments to its statute. The Order of Zhukov is awarded to commanders of military units and their deputies from among the senior officers: for skillful organization of troops (forces) and operations in strategic areas (theatres), or military operations during which, despite the numerical superiority of the enemy, the objectives of the operation were met; for skillful manoeuvres on land and in the air to surround the enemy, enabling the defeat of superior forces; for initiative and determination in choosing a site and time of a main attack which led to the defeat of the enemy on land and/or in the air while maintaining the combat readiness and capability to further prosecute; for carrying out a defensive breakout from an enemy encirclement for a future offensive, for the organization, the prosecution, the choice of environment and the defeat of the enemy; for tenacity in repelling enemy attacks from the air, land and sea, for keeping enemy troops pinned down in designated areas of responsibility to create conditions favourable for seizing the initiative and depriving the enemy's ability to continue offensive operations; for skilful organization and management of units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation stationed outside of the Russian Federation, for repelling an armed attack on them, as well as the protection of citizens of the Russian Federation from attack outside of the Russian Federation. The Order of Zhukov may be awarded to military units and formations involved in conducting operations on land and in the air, during which, despite the stubborn resistance of the enemy, the objectives of the operations were met with full operational capability of military units retained. May also be awarded to foreign citizens - soldiers of allied forces from among the senior officers who took part alongside soldiers of the Russian Federation, for organizing and conducting successful joint operations of allied troops (forces). The Order may be awarded posthumously. Award description The Order of Zhukov is a wide gilt cross patt√©e, the four arms are enamelled in red with a gilt border with alternating raised and recessed rims giving the appearance of shields. At the center, a blue enamelled medallion bearing the gold plated silver relief bust of Georgy Zhukov half turned to the right, below him, interlaced laurel and oak branches. Above the bust of Zhukov, the gilded inscription \\"–ì–ï–û–†–ì–ò–ô –ñ–£–ö–û–í\\" (GEORGY ZHUKOV). Between the cross arms, embossed gilt rays protruding from the center outward forming a wide square with rounded corners.

For more than thirty years, IAPMO‚Äôs standards-developing efforts have primarily focused on plumbing product standards. This concentration was primarily due to IAPMO members‚Äô expertise from more than 50 years of writing and updating the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC). IAPMO is an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-recognized Standards Development Organization (SDO). Recently, IAPMO‚Äôs efforts have broadened to include standards for mechanical products. Drawing on their years of experience, many IAPMO members have also contributed to the development of the Uniform Mechanical Code (UMC). Mechanical product standards cover heating, ventilation, cooling and refrigeration system products. IAPMO also publishes standards covering products used in the Recreational Vehicle and Manufactured Housing Industry called IAPMO Trailer Standards. IAPMO is an ANSI-Accredited Standards Development Organization The IAPMO Standards Development Process for IAPMO consensus standards is ANSI accredited. IAPMO is also an ANSI-accredited Standards Developing Organization for the ANSI Z124 Standards and for the Uniform Plumbing Code and the Uniform Mechanical Code. Proposal and projects for new IAPMO/ANSI standards are reviewed by the Main Standards Committee (MSC). The MSC is a balanced group of technical experts representing producers, users, consumers, government and academia professionals. Meetings are held annually and membership is open to all subject to approval by the IAPMO Executive Committee. IAPMO/ANSI Z124 Standards are ANSI-accredited consensus standards for plastic plumbing products. They cover material, testing and marking requirements for the products to which they pertain. Many of the requirements given in these standards evolved out of field experience with new materials and manufacturing techniques. Therefore, these standards have been expanded, listing separate areas of pertinent tests and performance requirements for such materials and techniques. IAPMO/ANSI Z1000 Series Standards are ANSI-accredited consensus standards for waste disposal products such as Septic Tanks and Gravity Grease Interceptors. They cover material, testing and marking requirements for the products to which they pertain. Many of the requirements given in these standards evolved from previous IAPMO PS or IGC documents. Standards development by IAPMO using the non-consensus process IAPMO develops standards using the non-consensus process. The IAPMO Standards Development Process is very ‚Äúconsensus-like,‚Äù however, in that anyone may submit changes to existing standards or propose new standards. In addition, the process is entirely transparent. All meetings of the Standards Review Committee (SRC) are open to the public and all documents are posted on the IAPMO Website for a 20 calendar day public review period before being published. Any interested party may submit comments relating to health and safety issues in the proposed document during that period. The IAPMO Standards Development Process is not a ‚Äútrue‚Äù consensus process in that a balance of all membership groups (for example, manufacturers, users, government or general interest) is not required among membership of the SRC. Membership on the SRC is open to all IAPMO members subject to approval by the IAPMO Board of Directors. IAPMO membership is open to any interested party. Anyone may submit proposals for new IAPMO standards or to change existing IAPMO standards. For products where no existing standards are available an IAPMO Guide Criteria (IGC) is developed. The minimum time in which an IGC can be developed is two months. This would occur if the Submittal Form was submitted on the deadline date (the third Friday of the month), reviewed and adopted by the SRC at its next meeting, and published with no changes following the 20 calendar day public review period. Any additional work or rewriting that requires review at subsequent SRC meetings would, of course, lengthen the process. To change an existing Product Standard or Trailer Standard would take the same amount of time that it takes to develop a new IGC. For Installation Standards it would take about three months, since their public review period is 60 days instead of 20. IAPMO Standards Review Committee The Standards Review Committee (SRC) is the IAPMO Committee that is responsible for the development of all IAPMO standards and for reviewing all standards that IAPMO R&T; uses for its product certification program. The members of the SRC are all IAPMO members and are appointed by the IAPMO Board of Directors The SRC meets monthly to review all proposed new standards and standards changes submitted to IAPMO. These meetings are open to members of industry and the public at large. All sides have the opportunity to present their views and supporting information on the proposals discussed at these meetings. Proposals voted on by the SRC are posted for 20 days on IAPMO Standards Development Program‚Äôs 20-Day Public Review page for public comment. The SRC will review any proposals submitted which relate to the development or revision of an IAPMO standard. The SRC also reviews information submitted relating to non-IAPMO standards that are reviewed by the SRC for adoption for listing purposes. The SRC will not accept submissions relating to issues outside the scope of its responsibilities. For example, proponents asking to change ASTM, ASME or other ANSI standards will be referred to the appropriate national standards committee. Proponents asking for review of issues relating to IAPMO R&T; listings will be referred to the IAPMO Plumbing Research Committee. The SRC requires that all proponents of a new proposal or a revision have someone at the meeting to represent them and to answer questions about their proposal. There is no specific time limit as to how long the proponent may present their information, however, because of the number of items on the committee‚Äôs agenda, proponents are asked to keep their presentations concise and as succinct as possible. The SRC members will ask questions if they need additional information. IAPMO Standards IAPMO Material and Property Standards IAPMO Product Standards (PS) are for plumbing and mechanical products. They cover material, testing and marking requirements for the products to which they pertain. In many cases, the IAPMO PS is the only U.S. standard for a particular product. Many IAPMO PS documents have been used as the initiating draft of an ANSI, ASME, ASTM or ASSE document. IAPMO SPS are IAPMO Product Standards for swimming pool, spa, whirlpool, whirlpool bathtub and Jacuzzi products. IAPMO Guide Criteria (IGC) are standards developed to cover products not yet addressed by existing consensus standards. Often new products or new technologies surge ahead far faster than most standards can keep pace. Through IGC procedure, IAPMO provides manufacturers and product developers an opportunity to draft standards as a vehicle for introducing new products. IAPMO IGC are ultimately used as the basis for developing IAPMO Product Standards and ASTM, ASME, ANSI or ASSE (American Society of Sanitary Engineering) standards. IAPMO Trailer Standards (TS) are a subcategory of IAPMO PS that focus on Recreational Vehicle and Manufactured Housing Products. As is the case with many IAPMO PS, IAPMO TS are often the only U.S. standard for a particular product. IAPMO Installation Standards (IS) are documents describing installation and inspection methods and procedures for plumbing products and systems. They were originally developed by the IAPMO membership to aid in the installation and inspection of plumbing products. They are not product standards, nor are they published by IAPMO as part of the Uniform Plumbing Code itself. Many jurisdictions, however, do choose to adopt IAPMO Installation Standards along with the Uniform Plumbing Code as part of their local plumbing ordinance.

It is a branch of Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio and is managed by Premier Health. Designed and constructed in 2007 as an outpatient facility with an emergency department, the facility grew faster than expected and became a full service hospital with as office building for physicians and a five-story patient wing added between 2009 and 2013. , the hospital is a complex on a campus adjacent to Interstate 675. It has 60 beds and features a number of specialty care options including oncology, cardiology, sports medicine, and maternity care to cater to the suburban community surrounding the hospital. History Miami Valley Hospital South sits on a campus along Interstate 675 south of Dayton, Ohio. The land had been owned by Premier Health for 20 years before the hospital was built in 2007, after several decades of planning for an outpatient hospital facility to serve southwestern Greene County, specifically Centerville and Bellbrook where significant suburban housing development was taking place. It was also constructed with partnerships with local high schools in mind to expand athletic training services for student athletes. The project was overseen by Premier Health employee Joann Ringer, who later became chief operating officer of the facility. The original outpatient facility was in October 2007 at a construction cost of $79,500,000, and featured a general surgery emergency department with 10 operating rooms. It had a total of 200 employees, many of whom were trained at Miami Valley Hospital. The facility also featured a helipad for CareFlight service, as emergencies were transferred to the Level I Trauma Center at Miami Valley Hospital. Originally called Miami Valley South Health Center, traffic to the hospital quickly escalated beyond what was projected, in part because of consumer demand for care in a single facility and without the need to transfer to other hospitals. In November 2008, the first inpatient beds were added following demand for recovery services from the emergency department, including several observation beds and 10 short-stay beds, at which point the facility was renamed Miami Valley Hospital South. These expansions were completed in June 2009. In late 2010, the hospital added a , five story patient wing to the facility, initially planned to cost $64,200,000. A $20,000,000 comprehensive cancer care center was also added along with an office building for physicians. Ultimately this expansion was completed at a cost of $51,000,000, which brought the hospital size to . The new patient wing opened in March 2012. This new wing included a 24-bed general surgery floor, a 24-bed orthopedic surgery floor, and a 12-bed maternity ward completed in August 2012, for a total of 60 beds. At the end of this expansion, the number of staff grew to 478 full- and part-time employees. The hospital saw admittance to its emergency department grow from 19,500 in 2007 to 2008 to 32,000 in 2012. From August 2012 to February 2013 the number of babies born in the maternity ward was 550. The facility features architecture intended to evoke a sense of calm. It was constructed with a central courtyard and a number of windows overlooking it, as well as nature-related artwork and architecture. There are also separate hallways for staff and visitors in order to make the interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service to the entrance. Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds. Services The hospital features a number of inpatient support services including a cafeteria food facility which also delivers food to patient rooms, housekeeping and environmental services. Among the hospital's medical specialties are general surgery, obstetrics and orthopedics. The hospital also features a high-risk breast cancer center aimed at preventative care for patients at risk of developing cancer, staffed by surgical oncologists and staff nurses. Among other specialty services are cardiology, sports medicine, and a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber. The hospital has equipment for cardiac monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography The facility also features a physician office building which houses staff practitioners as well as offices for physicians with independent practices within the community. The building, opened in January 2013, also features a comprehensive cancer care center focused on outpatient cancer care treatment, as well as space for patient education and support groups. In addition to physician labs, the facility also houses a concrete enclosed vault which houses a linear accelerator, which is used for precision cancer treatments.

Background > \\"Because of autism, the thief of politeness and friendship, I have no > sounding voice. By typing words I can play with my life and stretch from my > world to yours.\\" -Sarah Stup Sarah Stup, born in Frederick, Maryland, in 1983, was diagnosed as autistic at an early age. Stup‚Äôs disability is considered significant; she does not speak and has limited motor skills. At age 8, she began writing by pointing to letters on an alphabet sheet to spell out words. She now uses a variety of typing devices to converse and work. Stup's writing skills were further developed during a writing internship at the Arc of Frederick County (Maryland), while she was in her final year of high school. Currently, Stup has published two books: Do-si-Do with Autism (for children); and Are Your Eyes Listening? Collected Works (for adults). Stup is now at work on her third book, Paul and His Beast, which is for middle school-aged children. Stup has also launched \\"Sarah's Keepsake Collection\\" of gift booklets. The collection includes Heart and Spirit: Words to comfort, inspire and share, and Nest Feathers: A celebration of family, home, and memories shared. Although Stup's books deal with the experience of autism, each also touches on universal themes like love, personal meaning and the need to belong. Stup has been featured on TV and DVDs, in The Baltimore Sun, the Frederick News-Post, Baltimore‚Äôs Child and Exceptional Parent magazine. Features about Stup have also appeared throughout the Web and in publications for advocacy groups like the Autism Society of America. Today, from her hometown of Frederick, Maryland, Stup devotes her time to writing and advocating for people with disabilities. Her mission is to sensitize lawmakers, educators and the community at large to the barriers that those with disabilities face in gaining acceptance. Advocacy In 2004, Stup participated in the self- advocacy group Working Together and The Arc of Frederick County Legislative Committee's letter-writing campaign. The campaign aimed to educate lawmakers on legislative decisions that would impact the lives of people with developmental disabilities and their families. Stup traveled to Maryland‚Äôs State Capital in Annapolis to give testimony opposing House Bill #475. The bill would have promoted the use of institutional respite care and services for people with medical needs, rather than providing services in their own communities. Stup testified before a conference room packed with delegates and concerned citizens from around the state. > \\"Those with developmental disabilities and other differences are real people > inside bodies that work differently. We are worth knowing.\\" -Sarah Stup Additionally in 2004, Stup received both the Self Advocate of the Year award from The Arc of Maryland and the Frances and Lease Bussard Award for Self- Advocacy. Stup has also created \\"Hope's Ingredients,\\" an interactive training tool to support transitioning students and other self-advocates by identifying and following their dreams. Her co-creator was Aaron Stephens, her mentor at The Arc of Frederick County, Maryland. \\"Hope's Ingredients\\" has since been used at self-advocacy events, public schools, colleges, individual planning meetings and at conferences designed to create the leaders of tomorrow.\\"Hope's Ingredients\\" Books * Do-si-Do with Autism (2006) * Are Your Eyes Listening?

Stup first envisioned the book when she was 10 years old. The book, acclaimed by teachers as well as parents, offers an entertaining and thoughtful way to introduce children to the importance and joy of building meaningful relationships with those who have autism and other developmental disabilities.1 The story revolves around Taylor, the turtle with autism, who sheds light on what it is like to feel pain from the overwhelming movements and sounds around him. His feelings are especially pronounced on square dance day at school. Filled with dread, he retreats to the sidelines and finds solace in his beloved books. To his surprise, however, his classmates follow his lead and, in doing so, begin to focus less on their differences and more on all they have in common. A Taylor the Turtle Fun Pack DVD, which includes the Do-si-Do with Autism book and related disability awareness and teaching activities, is being produced. Do- si-Do with Autism was funded by the Maryland Developmental Disabilities Council, The Arc of Carroll County, the Maryland State Department of Education Division of Rehabilitation Services and The Arc of Frederick County. The book‚Äôs illustrators were students Matthew Starchak and Libby Sanders of Stevenson Universityin Maryland (formerly Villa Julie College). Do-si-Do with Autism debuted at the exhibit ‚ÄúRamps Over Fear‚Äù at Stevenson University in 2006. More than 500 people attended the event, which featured Stup‚Äôs writings, illustrations from the book and photos taken of her by Johnny Martyr. Kevin Walla, who was then Stup‚Äôs job coach, organized the event. thumb Are Your Eyes Listening? Collected Works Are Your Eyes Listening? Collected Works is Stup‚Äôs critically acclaimed collection of poetry, essays and reflections. Stup takes readers inside her world to experience the sights, sounds and feel of autism. Her vivid imagery and wrenching language reveals \\"the beast\\" (autism) but also the special gifts it imparts, gifts that she says make her the unique person she is. The book is about more than autism, however. Ultimately, it is a book about life. Stup touches on a wide range of topics: from family to oceans, coffee to snowflakes, writing to love, personal meaning to the need to belong. Beth Mende Conny, founder of WriteDirections.com, served as consultant on the book. The book‚Äôs cover was designed by Emily Dorr of Jean Peterson Design of Frederick, Maryland, won a gold ADDY from the Greater Frederick Advertising Federation. The photograph used in the design was provided by Johnny Martyr, a film photographer also based in Frederick, Maryland. Sarah‚Äôs Keepsake Collection Stup also has written a thematic series of booklets that include poetry, reflections and quotations. Sarah‚Äôs Keepsake Collection includes the booklets Heart & Spirit: Words to comfort, inspire and share and Nest Feathers: A celebration of family, home and memories shared. Do-si-Do with Autism Friendship Kit The Do-si-Do with Autism Friendship Kit offers an inventive and exciting approach to building meaningful relationships between children with and without autism. While most disability awareness materials for children focus on ways to include a child with autism into our world, the Do-si-Do with Autism Friendship Kit takes a new approach: it draws children into the world of Taylor the Turtle with autism, and promotes understanding and acceptance. Use this Kit for one neighborhood child or for a whole disability awareness unit at school. You'll learn too! Included is the book Do-si-Do with Autism in DVD, PDF, MP3 and stageplay formats; the Presenters guide for parents, advocacy groups, school staff, teens - anyone building accepting communities; child-friendly scripts and ready-to-go lessons plans; K-2 Common Core Standards Alignment Guide; a Tool Kit with disability awareness activities for individuals and groups; a Fun Pack with dozens and dozens of games, puzzles and skills-based fun sheets; downloadable rewards, certificates and gifts for children and adults; and as a Bonus, an inside view of autism via the video \\"Are your eyes listening?\\" Paul and His Beast Sixth- grader Paul Stephens, desperate to stay in a normal school, must tame his ‚ÄúBeast‚Äù‚Äî the bizarre autistic behaviors that make other students recoil and mock. But how can he tame his Beast when it protects him from a world where looking into another face can send his head spinning, voices crash into his ears like a bombardment, and trying to respond to the simplest question can lock up his limbs? Sometimes the Beast is his only refuge. In his struggle, Paul learns to deal with a boy even more autistic than he is, to function as a successful part of an academic team of ‚Äúnormals,‚Äù and to speak up for the Beast because he has learned that it means speaking up for himself. Sarah‚Äôs latest release is a middle grade novel, but of general interest to anyone who wishes to gain understanding into the world of autism: family, educators and advocates. Included for parents, educators and advocates is a Reader's Guide and group activities to spur conversation about new approaches to community inclusion and acceptance.

Background and education Greer was born to merchant Arthur Greer, who lived in Liverpool and the Isle of Man, and his wife, Mary Hadfield Greer, (n√©e Moore). He was educated at Old Aberdeen Grammar School before studying mental philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, where he graduated with first-class honours and won the Fullerton scholarship. Career In 1886, he was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn after winning the Bacon and Arden scholarships, and began practising as a barrister in Liverpool, where he met Moelwyn Hughes and Rigby Swift among others. His practice steadily grew, and in 1910 he became a King's Counsel. After continuing his career in London he was appointed a judge of the High Court of Justice (King's Bench Division) by Lord Birkenhead, and given the customary knighthood. In 1927 he became a Lord Justice of Appeal, sitting in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, and was also made a Privy Councillor. In 1932 he served as the British representative to the International Congress of Comparative Law at The Hague, and in 1939 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Fairfield, of Caldy in the County Palatine of Chester. He died at home on 4 February 1945, at which point the peerage became extinct.

Torres was first linked to the criminal conspiracy carried out by the FALN in 1976. That year, a burglar was arrested in Chicago who was attempting to peddle stolen explosives. The burglar led the Chicago police to an apartment, owned by Torres and nearly void of furniture, but there were boxes containing explosives and bomb-making paraphernalia, weapons, clothing, wigs, and photographs of Chicago buildings, maps of the city, and several FALN documents, including a manual for guerrilla warfare detailing deceptive practices and rules of clandestine living titled Posici√≥n Pol√≠tica. The bomb factory was also linked to Oscar L√≥pez Rivera and his wife, Ida Luz Rodriguez as well as to Torres' wife, Haydee Torres Beltran. All four became fugitives after the discovery. The four suspects were also linked to the National Commission on Hispanic Affairs (NCHA) of the Protestant Episcopal Church, a charitable organization based in New York City, meant to fund projects to assist Hispanic communities all over the United States. The next break in the investigation occurred in 1977, when 11 FALN members, including Carlos Torres and his wife, were arrested during a planned robbery of armored truck in Evanston, Illinois. The case of his wife, Torres Beltran, was adjudicated in New York because fingerprint evidence was able to identify her as the person placing the bomb that killed 26-year-old Charles Prendergast, at the Mobil office building in New York. Carlos Torres and most of the others arrested in Evanston were convicted of seditious conspiracy among other charges.Effects and effectiveness of law enforcement intelligence measures to counter homegrown terrorism: A case study on the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional (FALN); Roberta Belli, Final Report to the Science & Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, August 2012, page 16.

Release proceedings In January, 2009, Carlos Alberto Torres was scheduled for a parole hearing, after serving 29 years behind bars. On the eve of his hearing, prison authorities accused him and eight of his cellmates of possessing knives which the tenth cellmate had hidden in the light fixture of the cell. On July 28, the Parole board notified Carlos Alberto that they would postpone their decision for at least 90 days, pending resolution of the charges. Two days later, the prison disciplinary hearing officer held hearings on the weapons charges. Alberto's defense consisted not merely of his statement denying possession. The tenth cellmate appeared as a witness, admitting that the knives were his, and his alone, and that Carlos Alberto and none of the other cellmates knew he had hidden the knives in the light fixture. The guilty party also provided a sworn statement to this effect. The disciplinary hearing officer nevertheless found them guilty of possessing the hidden weapons.Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Carlos Alberto Torres: parole bid foiled by Bureau of Prisons Parole and release Torres was granted parole in May 2010, and released on July 26, 2010. Torres flew to his homeland island of Puerto Rico on 29 July to a hero's welcome. An activity was organized at the Don Pedro Albizu Campos Park, located across the street from the Tener√≠as sector of Barrio Machuelo Abajo, Ponce, where Torres was born on September 1, 1952. This is the same place in Ponce where Pedro Albizu Campos, another independence advocate, was born. Other prisoners Marie Hayd√©e Beltr√°n Torres, wife of Torres, was arrested alongside her husband in Illinois. She tried in New York and convicted to life in prison for the 1977 FALN bombing of the Mobil Oil Building in Manhattan that killed one person and injured several others. Torres was linked by a fingerprint on a job application she filled at the Mobil building just before the bombing.Reading Eagle, Associated Press article, dated September 8, 1977. Torres was released on April 14, 2009.Federal Bureaus of Prisons Inmate Locator Oscar Lopez Rivera who, like Torres, also became a fugitive in 1976, was arrested in 1981. He was also convicted of seditious conspiracy due to his participation in the FALN, as well as other offenses. He served 12 years of a 70-year sentence in isolation. Nevertheless, he rejected Clinton's conditioned offer of an early release and remains in prison. His projected release date is scheduled for June 26, 2023.Federal Bureau of Prisons.

The resulting mathematical models may be used to perform sensitivity analysis and generate data output in the form of reports and schedules. Due to the complexity level of building a workforce model, adoption of a workforce model is usually found in industries that have complex work rules, skilled or certified workers, medium to large teams of workers and fluctuating demand. Some examples include healthcare, public safety, and retail. A workforce modeling solution can also refer to software that effectively captures all the complexity of process from start to finish and delivers complete and correct results. Components include: *Demand management ‚Äì tracking the demand for skilled workers by small units of time (generally 15 or 30 minutes) *Employee availability ‚Äì tracking of contractual work hour obligations and limits on an individual basis for each employee *Employee preference ‚Äì tracking of preferred times and dates that employees wish to work (used to help increase job satisfaction) *Workflow management ‚Äì ability for the solution to automate normally manual processes such as requesting and approving time off, requesting shift swaps, and generating and posting schedules *Optimization Engine ‚Äì uses the mathematical model to create numerous schedules that are complete and correct and can be optimized on many dimensions simultaneously. The most important are cost, overtime and employee satisfaction Definition For a more detailed definition, the term must be differentiated from traditional staff scheduling. Staff scheduling is rooted in time management and encompasses the mere administration of past and future working times. However, during the last ten to fifteen years, this traditional approach has evolved towards a demand-oriented solution which, under economic aspects, also includes changes in personnel requirements and objectives when optimizing the scheduling of staff. Besides the two core aspects of demand- orientation and optimization, workforce modeling also incorporates the forecast of the workload and the required staff, the integration of employees into the scheduling process through interactivity, the management of working times and accounts as well as analyzing and monitoring the entire process. Workforce modeling solutions can, and should, be deployed enterprise-wide wherever complex scheduling needs or legal staffing ratios must be met. Due to the complex nature of a workforce model, creating one by hand is nearly impossible. By using a software solution for demand-oriented workforce management, planners can optimize staffing by creating schedules that at all times conform as closely as possible to the actual requirement. At the same time, a workforce modeling solution helps users to observe all relevant legislation, local agreements and the contracts with individual employees ‚Äì including work-life balance guidelines. Complexity of model Many workforce modeling solution applications use the more common linear programming approach to create the Workforce Model. Linear methods of achieving a schedule are generally based on assumptions that demand is based on a series of independent events, all of which have a consistent, predictable outcome.Clancy, Thomas R. Managing Organizational Complexity in Healthcare Operations. The Journal of Nursing Administration 38.9 (2008): 367-70. Print. Although this method is very common, the results are in most cases not as complete or efficient. In general, they produce a resulting schedule that is up to 75% complete and leaves the scheduler to complete the remaining shift assignments. Heuristics have been applied to the problem and metaheuristics has been identified as the best method for generating complex scheduling solutions.Burke, Edmund, Patrick De Causmaecker, Greet Vanden Berghe, and Hendrik Van Landeghem. The State of the Art of Nurse Rostering. Journal of Scheduling 7.6 (2004): 441-99. Print.

He is the youngest of three princes. \\"Harap Alb\\" received much posthumous attention from literary critics, and inspired works in other genres. These include Ion Popescu-Gopo's film De-a≈ü fi Harap Alb, a Postmodernist novel by and a comic book by Sandu Florea, alongside one of Gabriel Liiceanu's theses in the field of political philosophy. Harap (regional) or arap mean handsome man; it is usually associated with having dark black hair.

The word harap is an antiquated form of arap derived from \\"Arab\\" means \\"black person\\" or a \\"Moor\\". The arap or harap are a stereotypical race in the folklore of the Balkans, from Turkey in the south to modern Romania in the north, often, but not always, portrayed in a negative light.Elsie, Robert (2001), A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology and Folk Culture, C.

The name may also be an allusion to the protagonist's slave-like condition of \\"degradation and submission\\", as alp may be readily associated with the African slave trade or the enslavement of minorities in the Slavery in Romania). The tale thus becomes the hero's quest for the recovery of \\"human status\\". The name which means \\"White Black\\" has also been regarded as an oxymoronic example of absurdist tradition in the local folklore by comparatist Vasile MƒÉru≈£ƒÉ.MƒÉru≈£ƒÉ, Vasile (1987) \\"Arp et Tzara. A ¬´la recherche d'un niveau ‚Äì la diff√©rence¬ª\\", in Cahiers du Centre de Recherche sur le Surr√©alisme. M√©lusine IX. Arp po√®te plasticien, L'Age d'Homme, Paris, p. 92 Plot summary =Beginning= The narrative Povestea lui Harap-Alb, Wikisource.Plot partly outlined in and , passim. starts with a stock formula: a king's three sons on a quest, and the hero who is youngest will succeed. An unnamed king has a brother, the Green Emperor () who is nearing death, and as has no male heirs, he has written to king to send any of his three princes, and whichever one completes the journey shall inherit the whole empire. The kingdom and the Empire are on the \\"margins\\" of the earth, separated by desolate lands. The eldest son agrees to take up his uncle's challenge, and the king decides to test his courage by dressing up in bearskin and blocking the bridge along the way. The eldest prince makes a terrified return home. The monarch plays the same trick on his second son, with the same result. Without revealing his ruse, the king expresses his disappointment, which prompts the youngest to burst into tears and run out to the palace garden. There, an old woman beggar tells his fortune: the youngest prince shall become a glorious emperor. She urges him to attempt his uncle's quest, but warns that he should use only the items his father had when he was a bridegroom: ragged clothes, rusty weapons and an old stallion. She then vanishes into the skies. The youngest prince suffers his father's ridicule, but eventually obtains permission to go, and obtain's the king's his old items. The horse can be identified by the piece of wisdom given him by the old woman: the right horse will be the only one in the stable which will approach a tray of full embers at feeding. The horse gives three shakes and transforms into a beautiful steed. The horse can talk with his new master, and carry him leaping to the clouds and the Moon. The prince goes to the bridge and endures the bear ruse, and the king gives him the bearskin as trophy. As parting words, the father tells him to beware \\"of the red man, and especially of the bald one\\". =The Bald Man= The next leg of the journey takes the prince into a deep forest inhabited by the evil Bald Man (), who will enslave him by trickery. The prince twice rebuffs the Bald Man's offer of services, but the third time, has lost his way and decides to accept. By deception the creature tricks the prince into the bottom of a well, and would only let him out by submitting to his condition that the two must now exchange roles. So at the palace, the Bald Man is introduced as the king's son, while the young prince follows as his servant named \\"Harap Alb\\". The Green Emperor welcomes them unsuspectingly, but the Emperor's daughter catches the master striking his servant and reproaches him; she begins to wonder which one is truly noble and which one is base between the two of them. ;Bear and stag quests Harap-Alb is soon sent on his first dangerous quest. He is ordered by the Bald Man to retrieve the \\"salad from the Bear's Garden\\", which the Green Emperor was fond of. His talking horse reassures him and flying up into the air, carries him to an island, where he is reunited with the fortunetelling beggar, who now identifies herself as \\"Saint Sunday\\" (Sf√¢nta DuminicƒÉ). She dopes the bear's watering fountain with a sleep-inducing infusion of herbs, honey, and milk, and Harap Alb wrapped in bearskin gathers the salad before the beast awakes. Harap-Alb's second dangerous assignment is to hunt the enchanted deer whose skin is studded with precious stones, and to bring back its skull and hide. The deer's stare strikes one dead and no one has ever survived. Saint Sunday provides him with the visor and sword of (a dwarfish character). Following her directions, Harap Alb hides in a deep pit and ambushes the stag, cutting of its head in one stroke, then returns to the hole waiting until the head to completely die. During his wait, the severed stag's head calls out with a human voice asking to see him, and had he complied, the stag's \\"poisoned eye\\", would have killed him. ;Red Emperor's daughter The triumphant return with the gems greatly enhances Harap Alb's prestige, as well as Green Emperor's esteem of him. The Bald Man jealously tries to credit the feats to himself for training his servant with his stern ways. While the monarch is credulous, his daughter and her sisters grow even more skeptical, and decide to investigate further. They ask Harap Alb to set the table for the banquet, but the Bald Man makes the servant swear not to engage in conversation with the ladies. At the festivities, an enchanted bird-like creature, ' makes a surprise visit and announces: \\"You are eating, drinking and enjoying yourselves, but you fail to think about the Red Emperor's daughter!\\" There follows a lively debate concerning the tyrannical Red Emperor () and his daughter. Some guests claim that the latter is a malevolent witch, and some still that she is the bird itself, on a mission to propagate fear. The Bald Man subsequently volunteers Harap Alb to investigate the mystery, and sends him on a quest to capture the Red Emperor's daughter. =Journey to Red Emperor= ;Helper animals The prince's journey begins with an act of pity. He happens upon a wedding procession of ants on the bridge, and rather than to trample on them, decides to for the deep-watered river. A grateful winged ant gives him its wings, telling him to burn these in his need, and the entire colony will come to his aid. The prince has a similar encounter, this time with swarming bees. He deposits his hat for the swarm to rest, then later carries them to a new hive he made by hollowing out a log. In gratitude the queen bee presents him with a wing with which to summon her in his moment of seeking help. ;Companions Harap Alb continues the journey, and gains five companions. The first is GerilƒÉ (from ger, \\"frost\\", and the diminutive suffix -ilƒÉ), a man who shivers even in summer, whose cold breath turns into a gale that freezes everything to ice. After being bantered, GerilƒÉ replies \\"Laugh if you will, Harap Alb, but you'll not be able to accomplish anything without me where you're going\\", and the prince changes his mind, agreeing to let the man accompany him. They are joined by FlƒÉm√¢nzilƒÉ (from flƒÉm√¢nd, \\"hungry\\"; translated as \\"Eat-All\\"), who can consume huge amounts without satisfying his appetite and SetilƒÉ (from sete, \\"thirst\\"; also \\"Drink-All\\") with the bottomless drinking ability, OchilƒÉ (from ochi, \\"eye\\"), a sharp-eyed man whose sight reaches far distances, and PƒÉsƒÉri-LƒÉ»õi-LungilƒÉ (from pasƒÉre, \\"bird\\", a se lƒÉ»õi, \\"to widen oneself\\" and a se lungi, \\"to lengthen oneself\\"), who can grow in any direction at will, and reach heights only accessible to birds. Initially the gathering produces one disaster after another: burned down forests, depleted soil, drainage of water, exposure of secrets, and bird-killing. Harap Alb alone \\"did not cause any disruption\\". ;Red Emperor's castle The group eventually reaches the Red Emperor's court, where Harap Alb announces his intention to leave with the girl. The Red Emperor tries to eliminate them by lodging them in acopper house, and ordering it heate to an oven-like temperature. GerilƒÉ with his cold breath cooled it down. As a dilatory tactic, the Red Emperor invites the group to a feast, only to witness with alarm how rapidly his food and drink are consumed by FlƒÉm√¢nzilƒÉ and SetilƒÉ. The emperor then demands a test: they must sort a mier»õƒÉ (some 200 liters) of poppy seed from an equivalent quantity of fine sand in the space of one night, but this is accomplished with assistance from the ants. The monarch then tells the heroes that, if they want his daughter, they are to guard and follow for another night, letting them know that he does not know her ways. At midnight, the princess turns into a bird and escapes the palace, but, even though she takes refuge in the most inaccessible places, from \\"the shadow of the rabbit\\" to the far side of the Moon, she is tracked down by OchilƒÉ and eventually grabbed by PƒÉsƒÉri-LƒÉ≈£i- LungilƒÉ. The Red Emperor gives his final test: Harap Alb must distinguish the real daughter from his adoptive daughter, who is her exact double. This the protagonist accomplishes with assistance from the queen bee which identifies the real princess and alights on her cheek. A final challenge is presented by the girl herself, as a race between her turtle dove and his horse, to go to the place \\"from where the mountains bump head to head into each other\\", and obtain three twigs of its apple tree, three measures of the water of life and three measures of the dead water. Although slower, the horse forces the returning bird to hand him the items, and is first to return. The princess accepts the result as her destiny, and now willingly accompanies Harap Alb. =Triumph= Harap's companions disperse and go back to their original spots where they joined the group. Harap Alb falls in love with his hostage, and is downcast at the prospect of having to surrender her to the Bald Man. At the Green Emperor's court, the captivated Bald Man tries to take the Red Emperor's daughter by his arms, but she rebuffs him completely, exposing the Bald Man for assuming a false identity, and declaring that her intended (i.e. husband- to-be) was the real emperor's nephew, Harap Alb. The enraged Bald Man severs the hero's head with the broadsword the prince swore his oath on. The stallion snatches the Bald Man with its teeth, flies high up into the skies, and drops him to the ground. The princess mends back the prince's head and body, twirls the apple branch thrice over his head, repairing the wounds with the dead water, and reviving him with the water of life. The story ends with a magnificent wedding between Harap Alb, recognized as successor to the Green Emperor, and the Red Emperor's daughter‚Äîa feast which, according to the narrator's account, lasts \\"to this day\\". Style and symbolism =Generic traits= Owing to its sampling of intricate narrative traditions and its use of symbols, \\"Harap Alb\\" has been a traditional target of critical interest, and has produced various interpretations. George BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, who calls the story in its recorded form a \\"cultured fairy tale\\", discusses it as a \\"concise adventure novel [...] which has an accentuated ethical, didactic character\\". BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, who discusses the work's \\"great thematic complexity\\", also argues: \\"in general lines, CreangƒÉ's fairy tale follows the archetypal pattern of the popular fantasy tale\\". Similarly, researcher notes that the text is one of many by CreangƒÉ where a traditional pattern of folkloric inspiration is closely followed. This, he believes, is structured around three narrative solutions, the first of which is a \\"perturbing situation\\"‚Äîhere, the \\"extremely difficult journey\\" undertaken by the boy prince. The initial event is closely followed by a set of challenges invoking the action of forces larger than human life, \\"a whirlpool of events whose onset [the hero] cannot control, but which he dominates with support from supernatural beings and magical objects\\". A third element, the happy ending, consecrates the victory of good over evil, and often distributes justice in an uncompromising and violent form. Braga also sees \\"Harap Alb\\" as a peak among its author's literary contributions, ranking it above writings with similar pretexts such as The Story of the Pig. According to literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, the work also serves to illustrate Ion CreangƒÉ's interest in structuring each of his narratives around a distinctive moral, in this case: \\"that the gifted man will earn a reputation under any guise\\". The tale's narrative setting has itself been subject to critical scrutiny. According to literary historian and critic Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, it is \\"a projection into the fabulous of the peasant world, captured in its archaic stage, organized in Homeric fashion\\". The definitive version, which localizes dialectical patterns and bases the interactions between characters on the hierarchies of a village, allows critics to identify the setting as being the writer's native region of Moldavia, and probably even the rural area around T√¢rgu Neam≈£.; The effect is underlined by Ion CreangƒÉ's recourse to orality and its samples of Romanian humor: the narrative technique is enriched by descriptions, dialogue, the narrator's self-interrogation, interjections, jokes, fragments of folk poetry and various other picturesque elements. George CƒÉlinescu makes special note of the manner in which CreangƒÉ's narrative relies on peasant speech, and how its nuances serve to distinguish individual characters, all of which, he believes, exists within the framework of \\"playful realism\\". George BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu sees the writer's \\"pleasure of recounting [BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu's italics], verve and optimism\\" as instrumental contributions, likening CreangƒÉ's style to that of his predecessors Fran√ßois Rabelais and Anton Pann. Among the generic stylistic traits identified by BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu is the story's repeated and diverse use of \\"Homeric\\" hyperbole, from the presence of supernatural beings to the happy ending's transformation into an eternal feast. Another defining element of the account is the pause for effect, visually marked by the ellipsis and possibly originating from oral tradition, where it may also have allowed narrators to rest their voices. According to French academic Michel Moner, \\"Harap Alb\\" is one of the tales illustrating such techniques \\"to perfection\\". Among the elements which localize the narrative landscape, the collection of objects handled by the destitute prince throughout his quest is seen by BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu as an essence of \\"archaic civilization\\" and \\"forgotten tradition\\", culminating in the grant of a backsword, the \\"symbol of knightly valor\\". In Mircea Braga's view, many of them are means to a goal, which \\"can be 'lost' without consequence for the later development of the narrative, as happens, for instance, with the helmet and sword of Statu-PalmƒÉ-BarbƒÉ-Cot\\". The animals themselves behave as he they supposed to, changing their behavior for the benefit of the plot: \\"the extraordinary horse will not be able to prevent getting lost in the forest\\" and \\"is not able to prevent the Bald Man's ruse\\", but \\"he will lead [the prince], without straying, to Holy Sunday's house\\" and \\"shall become the one to kill [the Bald Man]\\". Basing himself on previous studies, Braga also concludes that the bearing of hunting-related symbolism on both the quests and the objects serving to overcome them is a clue to the ancient origin of the tale. In the view of comparatist Liliana VernicƒÉ, these items represent several aspects of the universe. Thus, the objects inherited from the king are supposed to symbolize \\"nature\\" and \\"the father's virtues: intelligence (the horse), beauty (the clothes), virility (the weapons) and self-restraint (the bridle)\\"., p.296 =The protagonist and his aides= The prince figure around whom the plot revolves has been defined by various researchers as a variant of the Romanian Prince Charming, or FƒÉt-Frumos, and through him of various other heroic figures in European folklore. Citing the earlier assessment of researcher Emil Bucu≈£a, literary historian Virgiliu Ene spoke of similarities between Harap Alb, FƒÉt-Frumos and Sigurd of the Nibelungenlied (who, Bucu≈£a and Ene note, also hides in a pit while waiting to kill the monster Fafnir).Ene, Virgiliu (1977) \\"Studiu introductiv\\", in Basme populare rom√¢ne≈üti, Editura Albatros, Bucharest, p. XXVII. The eponymous hero's quest is seen by critics as equivalent to a rite of passage, or more specifically to a coming of age quest.; ; , passim. The finality of this process, BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu notes, is Harap Alb's \\"social, ethical and erotic\\" fulfillment. According to Liliana VernicƒÉ, the process of reaching \\"spiritual maturity\\" is a complex one, involving three stages and, respectively, three narrative levels: the \\"suffering\\" Harap Alb evidences after being shamed by his brothers, the symbolic \\"death\\" which comes with giving in to the Bald Man's ruse, and the \\"rebirth\\" illustrated by his exploits., p.295 According to BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, Harap Alb portrays the Romanians' \\"national moral code\\", being characterized by \\"natural behavior\\" as opposed to \\"supernatural properties\\", evidencing \\"kindness, intelligence, sensibility, industriousness, patience, discretion\\" and \\"a moral sense, wittiness, joviality\\". CreangƒÉ's aim of rendering the prince as a familiar and sympathetic figure, the critic notes, is outlined by several elements in the story: \\"The protagonist sobs when he is scolded by his father, covers his mouth [in disbelief], falls victim all too easily to the Bald Man\\". Similarly, George CƒÉlinescu referred to the three princes' journeys as closely as equivalent to \\"a peasant from the Bistri≈£a leaving on a logging trip\\". VernicƒÉ, who notes that the king disguised as a bear guards \\"the threshold between the familial and social spaces\\", also observed that the prince's acceptance of his original quest, as depicted by CreangƒÉ's narrative, \\"is not out of his own will [...], but more so in order to alleviate his father's grief\\". In BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu's view, the main characteristics setting Ion CreangƒÉ's account apart from its sources of inspiration is its treatment of the other characters: \\"With CreangƒÉ, the characters are no longer symbolic, abstract (as they are in popular fairy tales), but display a psychological, peasant-like [...] individuality, within a framework that blends the supernatural and the real\\". He sees this as being especially true for the prince's \\"five fabulous friends\\" (OchilƒÉ, SetilƒÉ, GerilƒÉ, FlƒÉm√¢nzilƒÉ, PƒÉsƒÉri-LƒÉ≈£i-LungilƒÉ), whose choice of names, \\"defining the character trait which individualizes them\\", is \\"a particularity of CreangƒÉ's fairy tale [BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu's italics]\\". Braga underlines the serendipitous nature of these characters' presence within the story, which he also believes is relevant for Holy Sunday and Harap Alb's horse: \\"[they all] are nothing but 'helpers', with more or less unnatural powers, they appear to us as forces whose exercise is invoked by the very development of the 'ordeal'\\". In VernicƒÉ's interpretation, they may also represent anthropomorphized manifestations of the hero's own \\"energies\\", which he is supposed to be putting to use. Critic Simona Br√¢nzaru places the representations of FlƒÉm√¢nzilƒÉ and SetilƒÉ, both of whom \\"seem somewhat content to have gotten their friend out of trouble\\", in connection with the ideas of Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin on the \\"philosophy of the Gaster\\" (that is, belly), while noting: \\"As in any fairy-tale, be it in its cultivated variant, nothing is accidental\\". =The enemies= Harap-Alb The Bald Man, despite his rustic \\"peasant speech\\", () is depicted as an evil and despotic antithesis to Harap Alb.: \\"the symbol of evil, a cunning, intimidating, violent, arrogant, dictatorial man\\". Liliana VernicƒÉ also sees in the villain a \\"double\\" of the protagonist, one who takes complete control of his victim's mind through persuasion. Historian however provides an ethnographic theory regarding the figure, placing it in relation to Romanian history. He thus compares the Bald Man and other hairless antagonists in Romanian folklore with negative images of the raiding Tatars, who, in contrast to their Romanian adversaries, customarily shaved their skulls. (English tr.); Majuru (2012) \\"\\" According to ethnologist Pavel RuxƒÉndoiu, the characteristic baldness also has the attribute of an omen, corresponding to a traditional view that God marks dangerous men.RuxƒÉndoiu, Pavel (2003), , in Proverb ≈üi context, Editura UniversitƒÉ≈£ii Bucure≈üti, Bucharest, p.191. (e-book version at the University of Bucharest site) He draws a similar conclusion in respect to the fragment in which the Bald Man doubles as the \\"red man\\" (), noting that it could be read as a proverb (in a line with various attested Romanian sayings, which caution against keeping company with \\"wild\\" or \\"insane\\" people). Described by researcher of children's literature Mugura≈ü Constantinescu as \\"evil and cunning\\", the Red Emperor is the story's secondary antagonist. The adjective designating him evidences a folkloric tradition which associates a range of negative or malignant features with the color red. In this context, several other local fairy tales refer to a perpetual conflict between a Red Emperor on one side, and a Green or White one on the other. According to linguist LazƒÉr ≈ûƒÉineanu, the monarch designated as \\"red\\" is portrayed by such accounts as \\"the cruelest tyrant of his time\\", and a common theme involves him forcing the hero to solve \\"enigmas\\" on the pain of death. In CreangƒÉ's version, George CƒÉlinescu notes, such attributes are accompanied by the character's manner of expressing himself with \\"crass vulgarity\\" (the critic cites him invoking the devil and commenting on his daughter's sexual availability in dialogues with the prince). Majuru, building on observations initially made by ≈ûƒÉineanu, notes that the Red Emperor, as well as the cryptic \\"red man\\" omen, allude to another aspect of ethnic strife: a possible early medieval conflict between locals and the intruding Khazars, or \\"Red Jews\\". The emperor's daughter is believed by VernicƒÉ to be standing for the prince's achievement of his ultimate goal, that of controlling his own life, with their marriage being a \\"hireogamy between the Virgin-Mother-Earth and the Aquarius-Father-Sky\\". =Other characters= The Green Emperor's characteristics heavily contrast with those of his evil counterpart. He is, according to Constantinescu, \\"good, charitable, welcoming\\", \\"a perfect host\\" and \\"a sage who, with responsibility and serenity, foresees the proper order of things\\". Building on an earlier comment by George CƒÉlinescu, Constantinescu sees the monarch figure, his association with the color green and his appreciation of lettuce, as epitomizing a healthy lifestyle and the preservation of vitality in old age. In his implicit agreement to have the prince act as a suitor for the Red Emperor's daughter VernicƒÉ sees proof that the \\"wise old man\\" plays a role in Harap Alb's sexual awakening, and in \\"stripping away [the prince's] ego\\". Resembling the Green Emperor to a certain degree, Holy Sunday also illustrates a positive vision of old age. The character makes an appearance in another two of CreangƒÉ's tales (\\"The Story of the Pig\\" and \\"The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter\\"), but, according to Mugura≈ü Constantinescu, her depiction in \\"Harap Alb\\" is \\"the most complex\\". The researcher discusses the intricate religious representations of Holy Sunday, as evidenced by \\"Harap Alb\\" and the other texts: the narratives alternate between the themes Christian mythology (the sacred position of Sundays in the liturgical calendar) and paganism (the queen of fairy creatures, or z√¢ne). In Constantinescu's assessment, Holy Sunday is \\"an earthly being, attached to the plants and flowers\\", whose abode on the island is \\"a symbol of isolation and happy solitude\\", but also an \\"aerial being\\" displaying \\"the lightness of clouds\\". According to VernicƒÉ, she and Harap Alb's stallion are both key figures on the first narrative level, and who \\"emerge from the realm of the real as manifestations of energies\\". Her first appearance in the story, the researcher proposes, borrows from the imagery from angels, and stands for \\"an enlightenment of the mind by God\\". George BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu sees in Holy Sunday as \\"a gifted woman\\" who plays an essential part in the coming of age rituals of traditional rural society, but also as a holy woman \\"under the guise of a peasant\\". In addition, Constantinescu places stress on the alternation of youthful and old age attributes: \\"Despite her multicentennial age, she manifests rather astonishing liveliness and physical agility\\". According to the same commentator, the saint's literal charm over the prince stems from her \\"bewitching\\" discourse, which is \\"half-humble, half-ironical\\" in content, as well as from her other \\"supernatural powers\\". Cultural impact and tributes The Bald Man (top) and Harap Alb (bottom), as depicted by Sandu Florea The \\"Harap Alb\\" story made a sizable impact on later Romanian literature, through its presence in critical commentary, as well as through homages in other works of fiction. It also touched other areas of local culture, beginning in the interwar period, when composer Alfred Mendelsohn turned it into a ballet. Several ideological interpretations of the narrative surfaced after World War II, in both Romania and the Soviet Moldavian SSR (a part of the Bassarabian areas, later independent as Moldova). Partly replicating official Marxist- Leninist interpretations in the latter region, literary historian Vasile Coroban described Harap Alb the character as an exponent of class struggle, seeing his victory over the Red Emperor as premonitory for \\"the fall of the bourgeois-landowning regime\\". Eugen Lungu, \\"C√ÆtƒÉ literaturƒÉ at√Æta criticƒÉ\\" , in Revista Sud-Est, 3/2002 During the final two decades of Romania's communist period, under the rule of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, the recovery of nationalist discourse into national communist dogma also encouraged the birth of Protochronism, a controversial current which a claimed Romanian precedence in culture. In a 1983 volume by one of its theorists, Edgar Papu, \\"Harap Alb\\" is seen having anticipated The Open Work, an influential volume by Italian semiotician Umberto Eco‚Äîa conclusion which literary historian Florin MihƒÉilescu later described as a sample of Papu's \\"exegetic obsession\\", lacking in both \\"sense of humor\\" and \\"sense of reality\\".MihƒÉilescu, Florin, De la proletcultism la postmodernism, Editura Pontica, Constan≈£a, 2002, p.158. First brought to the Romanian stage in the eponymous adaptations of Ion Lucian (one of the first productions premiered by the Ion CreangƒÉ Children's Theater) and Zoe Anghel Stanca, \\"Harap Alb\\" was also the subject of a 1965 Romanian film, directed by celebrated filmmaker Ion Popescu-Gopo. Titled De-a≈ü fi Harap Alb, it was noted for its tongue-in-cheek references to modernity (for instance, when showing PƒÉsƒÉri-LƒÉ≈£i-LungilƒÉ using a three-stage arrow). Marian ≈¢u≈£ui, Portret Ion Popescu-Gopo, at Editura LiterNet, June 2002; retrieved August 7, 2009 The film starred Florin Piersic, who was on his third collaboration with Popescu-Gopo, in the title role.

(October 2005) , in Observator Cultural, Nr. 290 Igor Vieru, one of the Moldavian SSR's leading visual artists, was also noted for his illustrations to the story, which his disciples later turned into murals for Gugu≈£ƒÉ Coffee House in Chi≈üinƒÉu.

In a 2004 essay later included in his Despre minciunƒÉ (\\"On Lies\\") volume, philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu used a sequence of the story, that in which the Bald Man succeeds in convincing everyone that he is the king's son, to construct a critical metaphor of Romania's own post-communist history. Dem√©ny, P√©ter (February 2008) \\"Eseu sau program politic?\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 412 Suciu, Arthur (June 22, 2007) \\"Harap Alb sau tiranul peratolog\\", in Ziarul Financiar Accusing the political system which had emerged in 1989 of promoting political corruption instead of reform, Liiceanu contended: \\"The 'Sign of the Bald Man' is the sign of incipient tyranny, originating with the cathartically interrupted act of the December Revolution and a Harap Alb who has been silenced. [...] But [...] there does come a time when corruption becomes extreme, when it becomes glaring for anyone to see, when everyone finds out that the Bald Man is the Bald Man and not Harap Alb. At that moment in time, a people should have an extraordinary chance in finding a living Harap Alb\\". The metaphor also drew a parallel between the fairy tale protagonist and Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's theories about the ideal prince, both taken as symbols of men capable to act against public perception for the greater good (see Machiavellianism). Commenting on this vision, essayist and political analyst Arthur Suciu argued that the \\"living Harap Alb\\" Liiceanu was referring to may have been Traian BƒÉsescu, elected President of Romania during the 2004 election. Another interpretation of the story in relation to 21st century realities comes from Indian scholar Jacob Srampickal. He evidences the manner in which the protagonist and his fellowship cooperate, and choosing \\"Harap Alb\\" as \\"one of the best metaphors\\" for interdisciplinarity, notes: \\"while each participant played his role at the right time, the awareness of the mission belonged always to the hero\\".Srampickal, Jacob (2007) \\"Interdisciplinarity Is Inevitable and a Major Challenge in Communication Studies\\", in Helmuth Rolfes, Angela Ann Zukowski (eds.), Communicatio Socialis.

In 2004, CreangƒÉ's story was subjected to a Postmodern interpretation, with Stelian ≈¢urlea's novel Relatare despre Harap Alb (\\"A Report about Harap Alb\\"). The plot devices separating it from the original include locating the events in various real locations (from South America to the Arctic Ocean), hidden quotation from classical writers such as Fran√ßois Rabelais, William Shakespeare and Pierre Corneille, and depictions of the Bald Man as a Machiavellian character (in the negative sense) and of the Green Emperor as revered Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great.

The show‚Äôs primary sponsor was Full Tilt Poker, which supplied the contestants and the professional poker players (‚Äúaces‚Äù) against whom they competed.http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/nbc-announces-face-the-ace- poker-show-2238/ Format Contestants are poker players 21 or older who won a free qualifying tournament on Full Tilt Poker and were flown to Las Vegas for filming at Cin City Studios. In the show, the contestant chooses one of four doors, each with a poker professional behind it. Potential opponents include Phil Ivey, Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, Erick Lindgren, Erik Seidel, Allen Cunningham, John Juanda, Jennifer Harman, Phil Gordon, Andy Bloch, Mike Matusow, Gus Hansen, Huck Seed, Gavin Smith and Patrik Antonius. The contestant then ‚Äúfaces the ace‚Äù in a heads up (one-on-one) Texas hold 'em poker match. If the contestant defeats the pro, he can choose to either take US$40,000 and leave, or risk it all and play another pro for $200,000 in a second round. In the third and final round, the prize increases to $1,000,000. Reception Face the Ace was the least-viewed program among the four major networks (Fox, CBS, ABC, and NBC) in the 9-10 pm timeslot when it premiered August 1, 2009.http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/face-the-ace-struggles-in- ratings-debuts-in-last-place-3768 The episode had 1.59 million viewers in its first 30 minutes on the air, but this number dropped to 1.54 million in the next 30 minutes, making it the only show in its timeslot to see a drop in viewership in its second half of airing. The show competed against America's Most Wanted on Fox, the movie Red Eye on ABC, and Numb3rs on CBS. Several of NBC's largest affiliates, including Post-Newsweek's KPRC in Houston and WDIV of Detroit, along with Milwaukee's WTMJ and several smaller affiliates pre- empted the two primetime episodes with either local programming, a sponsored program from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, or infomercials, likely due to concerns about gambling-related television in primetime or anticipated subpar ratings. The Post-Newsweek stations declined to air all of NBC's poker- related programming, including Poker After Dark, due to corporate policies.

Soap dishes are usually located in or near a sink, shower, or bathtub. Most soap dishes are made from waterproof materials such as plastic, ceramic, metal, or glass, though some are made from bamboo. A china saucer or sponge may serve as a soap dish. A soap dish accommodates bar soap, whereas a soap dispenser accommodates liquid soap or foam soap. Design elements An unbreakable plastic soap dish with ventilating ridges, self-draining contours, and suction cup attachment Elements in the design of a soap dish include safety, ventilation, cleanliness, placement, aesthetics, and cost. When a soap dish is part of a bath accessories set, coordinated group design may be utilized. Notable soap dish designs include Leonard L Hierath's May 2018 US Patent #US-9962042 Article Support (soap dish) US Patent and Trademark Office; Robert A. Pitton's 1956 US patent for a reversible, hemispherical soap dish and Bernard Cohen's October 2017 design for the \\"SoapAnchor\\" (patent pending). =Safety= Because of their intended use in wet and potentially hazardous environments, most soap dishes are designed with safety in mind. Such features include unbreakable materials, non-slip surfaces, rounded edges, and secure installation elements (e.g., wall mount hardware, a suction cup, or non-skid feet). Depositing or retrieving a slippery bar of soap is facilitated by an open (or semi-open) sided design or by a shallow lip. =Ventilation= A bar of wet soap relies on ventilation to dry. A number of design elements may be used to increase ambient airflow around the soap, including vented surfaces or surfaces interspersed with bumps, ridges, or slats. Mechanical ventilation has not yet become a widespread design element in soap dishes. =Cleanliness= A sink with two built-in soap dishes (aside the faucets) Because of their association with hand washing and hygiene, soap dishes themselves are often the focus of cleanliness. To aid in cleanup, some self- draining soap dishes are designed to allow soapy residue to collect in a compartment below the raised bar of soap. Other such soap dishes funnel the soapy reside directly to the adjacent sink or bathtub, necessitating strategic placement of the soap dish. =Placement= Most soap dishes are standalone accessories whose placement is at the user's discretion, though some are a built-in feature of a sink, shower, or bathtub. Standalone soap dishes may be entirely portable or may include options for semi-permanent or permanent installation on a horizontal or vertical surface. Locating a soap dish outside the perimeter of a faucet's or showerhead's stream helps the soap to avoid excess erosion. =Aesthetics= Though utilitarian in purpose, soap dishes may be given aesthetic treatment. A soap dish in the form of a whale, for example, was patented in 1961 by Sonia Adelson, with \\"the mouth portion thereof being adapted to receive and dispense a bar of soap in an amusing, novel and useful manner\\". Another example is the \\"Bodoni Soap Dish\\", a February 2013 design by David Strauss that was inspired by the legacy of Massimo Vignelli. History A soap dish played a role in a seminal event in the 7th century when Byzantine Emperor Constans II (630-668) was assassinated with one. A classified ad that appeared on 25 March 1820 in the Sydney [Australia] Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser lists auction items that include soap dishes. The Oxford English Dictionary gives a later \\"first evidence of use\\" for the term soap-dish as 1837 (in The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens). A pewter soap dish made in Meriden, Connecticut between 1807 and 1835 is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. An 1887 medical journal discusses an operating table that includes a built-in soap dish and an 1892 book on industrial arts shows a soap dish attachment for a scrub bucket. A toy porcelain soap dish likely from the 1890s was unearthed by archaeologist Laurie A. Wilkie at the Oakley Plantation in Louisiana. Wilkie explains in detail the facts surrounding this soap dish that led her to interpret it to be \\"a little material embodiment of someone's love for a child\\". By the late 19th century, Sears Roebuck & Company was influencing the spread of the soap dish in American households. A pocket-sized metal soap dish emblazoned with two crossed swords that was in use during World War I (1914-1918) is in the special collections of the Pritzker Military Museum & Library. In 1919, Witter Bynner immortalized a soap dish in his poem entitled I Evade, which is reproduced here in its entirety: \\"The look in your eyes / Was as soft as the underside of soap in a soap-dish ‚Ä¶ / And I left before you could love me.\\" A gold-plated soap dish was one of over 60 artifacts from Saddam Hussein's private airport and palace that were returned to Iraq by the US government in March 2015 as part of an Iraqi national project to preserve its cultural heritage.

Najafi's songs mostly deal with issues such as theocracy, poverty, sexism, censorship, child labor, execution, drug addiction and homophobia. In interviews, he has stated that he strives to use poetic, literary, philosophical and political elements in his music. Early life Shahin Najafi was born in 1980 in Bandar-e Anzali, Iran. When he was six years old, his father died, and later his brother became a drug addict and also died. He began writing poetry as a teenager and began learning the guitar in the classical and flamenco styles at the age of 18. He then became an underground artist in Iran, performing in both rock and Spanish music styles, working with various bands. He studied sociology at the University of Gilan and openly expressed his opinions about the university, leading to his getting expelled. Music career =Immigration to Germany= Najafi was head of an underground music band in Iran before his immigration to Germany, but he was banned for his offenses towards the Islamic faith in Iran by the Iranian government after his second music show. He was also the head of the Inan music band in Germany. Then he joined the Tapesh 2012 music band. Tapesh 2012 were welcomed by Persian broadcasters and the international media by political and social songs and poems of Najafi. An article published in No. 19194 of the conservative newspaper Kayhan on 29 September 2008 criticized Tapesh 2012's activities. Kayhan published the article titled Establishing democracy with drum & circle. A part of it goes as follows: =Release of first studio album= On 1 May 2008, Najafi released his first studio album, Ma mard nistim (We Are Not Men), with partnership and composition of the Tapesh 2012 music band. This album was his official and professional beginning in Persian hip hop music. The album attracted the audience and listener more than any album before it was released in Persian hip hop style. =Separation from Tapesh 2012= Najafi ended cooperation with Tapesh 2012 from the beginning of 2009. A variety of reasons have been proposed related to his separation from this group. The main reason is releasing the \\"Around us\\" single song in Voice of America TV without permission. The supervisor of Tapesh 2012 later apologised to Najafi and stated: the song has been inadvertently released in Voice of America TV. Najafi accepted the apology. =Reaction to the 2009 Iranian presidential election= After the Iranian election protests, Najafi released a single named Neda in July 2009 dedicated to Neda Agha-Soltan, an activist killed during the protests. He released his second studio album titled Tavahhom (Illusion) on 19 September 2009 by the German-Iranian publishing house \\"Pamas-Verlag\\". In this album, several songs are about the intense protests against the Iranian government and the political oppression that occurred after the presidential election. Can be cited to \\"Vaghti khoda khabe (When God is asleep)\\" through these songs. The song's lyrics protest the 2009 Iran poll protests trial, militia violence, the use of torture on prisoners and the Supreme Leader of Iran. =Formation of Antikarisma= He formed a new rock band as Antikarisma band in January 2010. The new band, Antikarisma, consists of Najafi, Babak Khazaei, Armin Mostaed, and Pejman Afshari, who live in Germany. =Fatwas and death threats= Following the release of the song \\"Ay Naghi!\\" (\\"Hey, Naghi!\\"), Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani, a 101-year-old Shi‚Äôite cleric based in Qom, issued a fatwa death sentence against Najafi for apostasy.   * Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem-Shirazi, a \\"source of emulation\\" for many Shia Muslims, also issued a fatwa declaring Najafi guilty of apostasy.  As of 15 May 2012, more than 800 people in Iran had joined a Facebook campaign calling for Najafi to be executed, saying they were ready to assassinate him if necessary. An Iranian web site, Shia-Online.ir, offered a US$100,000 bounty to anyone who killed Najafi. In May 2012, the online site HonareNab.ir posted an online \\"Shoot the Apostates\\" flash computer game inviting people to shoot and kill Najafi.  * \\"Those who love Imam Hadi can practice killing Shahin Najafi by playing this flash game,\\" said Honar Nab Eslam, who developed the game. On 25 May 2012, Shiite cleric Ahmad Alamolhoda demanded a plan to execute Najafi. In June 2012, forty authors of the Rah-e Nikan religious publishing house promised to give royalties from their books to whoever killed Najafi.  The song has drawn sharp anger from protesters who believe it is offensive towards Imam Naghi, the 10th Imam in Shi‚Äôite Islam. In an interview, Najafi stated that he was inspired by \\"The Campaign to Remind Shiites about Imam Naghi\\" to compose the song. The campaign is a Facebook page that pokes fun at Islamic, and specifically Shi'ite, hadiths, with members creating fake, funny hadiths and stories centered around a fictional character named Naghi, who is based on Imam Naghi. =2012 US tour= Najafi started a United States tour in 2012, starting with a talk on 30 September, and later a concert on 16 November at University of California, Berkeley, events sponsored by Iranian Student Alliance in United States of America. He continued the tour in UC San Diego on 18 November. Political and social activities In addition to individual work in his concerts and campaign songs, Najafi had many performances on various political and social occasions. In October 2008, he had a music show on \\"Peace Conference\\" in Germany. In August 2009, with some poets and writers in shows of \\"\\"Night of solidarity with the liberal struggle\\"\\", Najafi had a protest rock show in Stockholm, Sweden.

Founded by Dr. Mohan Sinha Mehta in 1968. The organisation turned 50 in 2018. Seva Mandir works mainly in natural resource development and sustainability, village development, women empowerment, education and health care, continuing education, and children's welfare. Seva Mandir Non-Formal Education Centre.Photo courtesy of GiveWell.  History  Dr. Mohan Sinha Mehta (a distinguished Indian ambassador and civil servant) founded Seva Mandir in 1968. Initially, the focus of the organisation was to provide Adult Education, ensuring that they had the tools and knowledge to become leaders of their own development. Between 1973 and 1976, an extreme drought in Udaipur district led Seva Mandir to expand its focus to encompass relief and agriculture extension services. Eventually, the organisation moved to work on empowerment and primary education as well.  Current activities  = Natural resources = Seva Mandir develops water harvesting systems to increase the availability of water for agriculture and clean drinking water for communities. Furthermore, the organisation works on regenerating common land. The majority of the rural and tribal communities depend on the common land for their survival. More than 120 million trees have been planted in an effort to combat climate change. = Women's empowerment = Seva Mandir run Self-Help Groups, Women's Resource Centres and a shelter home for women who have faced physical and/or mental abuse. = Primary education = Seva Mandir runs over 140 Shiksha Kendra (bridge schools) in remote rural areas. Shiksha Kendras use an activity-based learning method to teach previously out-of- school children aged between 6‚Äì14 years old. A Residential Learning Camp is also run for the same age range. = Youth = Youth Resource Centres are run to connect often left-behind adolescent boys and girls with vocational, life and social skills trainings. A football initiative is used to link the young people in rural and tribal communities with the resource centres. = Peri- urban = Seva Mandir works in 2 peri-urban areas; Delwara and Kelwara, the latter or which is near Kumbhalgarh fort. The organisation works on issues of governance, water availability, waste management, and heritage restoration. A community and heritage walk is also run in Delwara for tourists. = Community institutions = Seva Mandir creates and facilitates Community Institutions in rural and tribal communities. It is mandated that these institutions are democratically elected and have an equal representation of men, women, and children. Their aim is to take responsibility for their own development and sustain projects after Seva Mandir steps back.  Notable associations  Seva Mandir's research association with Nobel Prize winners Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer began in 1996 and set out to improve the health and educational status of remote rural and tribal communities of Udaipur and Rajsamand districts. The research studies contributed to the global discourse on the alleviation of poverty. Banerjee and Duflo discussed the results of their research with Seva Mandir and other organisations globally in their book Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty.

It was the second time the elections were held in December (the first was in 1936); traditionally elections occurred on New Year's Day. Incumbent mayor Hiram E. McCallum narrowly defeated Allan Lamport. The defeat of Norman Freed and the failure of Charles Sims to regain his seat would bring to a close the communist Labor-Progressive Party's presence on Toronto's City Council though the party, and its successor, the Communist Party of Canada would continue to elect members as school trustees for several decades. Toronto mayor McCallum, running for his fourth one-year term, was challenged by Controller Lamport. McCallum had faced only token opposition in his previous elections, but Lamport came surprisingly close to defeating him. For much of election night it looked as though Lamport would win, but it was swung by McCallum's ten thousand vote margin in the North Toronto Ward 9. ;Results: :Hiram E. McCallum - 86,491 :Allan Lamport - 84,987 Board of Control Lamport's decision to run for mayor left one vacancy on the Board of Control. This opening was won by Alderman Louis Shannon, with Ford Brand, secretary of the Toronto and District Labour Council finishing fifth and Alderman W.H. Collings in sixth.

During the Ottoman invasion, two Serbian armies were set up to defend the Despotate, with the 1st army being commanded by Nikola Skobaljiƒá in Duboƒçica, near Leskovac, and the 2nd army being on the banks of Sitnica River in Kosovo. An initial invading Ottoman force heading from Sofia cut off Skobaljiƒá's army from Serbia's north. Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá suggested that Skobaljiƒá either surrender, or hide from the Ottoman army until John Hunyadi was able to reinforce or liberate the trapped half of the Serbian army, which would render the Ottomans to pillage and raze the rich southern part of the despotate with no resistance. The young voivode disobeyed the despot, and the invading Ottoman army coming from Macedonia was met by Nikola Skobaljiƒá near Banja. The Serbs scored a decisive victory against the Ottoman army, employing guerrilla tactics. Skobaljiƒá continued his forays against the Ottomans, operating in Southern Serbia and the Leskovac area, and scored several victories against the armies of the Sultan, especially in the Battle of Kru≈°evac, with the help of John Hunyadi. The failure of his generals to beat a tiny army rendered Mehmed II to deal with Skobaljiƒá personally. He reinforced his armies and finally confronted Skobaljiƒá on November 16th, finally defeating his army at Tripolje (near Novo Brdo), where Voivode Nikola and his men fought to the last man, inflicting disproportionately large casualties on the Ottoman force.Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time, (Princeton University Press, 1978), 110.

The reaction is called nucleophilic aliphatic substitution (of the halide), and the reaction product is a higher substituted amine.

The reactions are complicated by the tendency of the product (a primary amine or a secondary amine) to react with the alkylating agent. For example, reaction of 1-bromooctane with ammonia yields almost equal amounts of the primary amine and the secondary amine.Organic Chemistry John McMurry 2nd Ed. Therefore, for laboratory purposes, N-alkylation is often limited to the synthesis of tertiary amines. An exception is the amination of alpha-halo carboxylic acids that do permit synthesis of primary amines with ammonia.Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 1, p.48 (1941); Vol. 4, p.3 (1925). Link Intramolecular reactions of haloamines X-(CH2)n-NH2 give cyclic aziridines, azetidines and pyrrolidines. N-alkylation is a general and useful route to quaternary ammonium salts from tertiary amines, because overalkylation is not possible. Examples of N-alkylation with alkyl halides are the syntheses of benzylaniline,Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 1, p.102 (1941); Vol. 8, p.38 (1928). Link 1-benzylindole,Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Synth. 2008, 85, 10-14 Link Industrially, ethylenediamine is produced by alkylation of ammonia with 1,2-dichloroethane. Aniline and related aryl derivatives Traditionally, aryl amination is difficult reaction which usually requires \\"activated\\" aryl halides, such as those with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups ortho or para to the halogen atom.Organic Chemistry 4th Ed. Morrison & Boyd. For the arylation of amines with unactivated aryl halides, the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction is useful. In this process, palladium complexes serve as catalysts.J. F. Hartwig, \\"Organotransition Metal Chemistry: From Bonding to Catalysis\\" University Science Books, 2010. . :The Buchwald-Hartwig reaction Alkylation using alcohols Industrially, most alkylations are typically conducted using alcohols, not alkyl halides. Alcohols are less expensive than alkyl halides and their alkylation does not produce salts, the disposal of which can be problematic. Key to the alkylation of alcohols is the use of catalysts that render the hydroxyl group a good leaving group. The largest scale N-alkylation is the production of the methylamines from ammonia and methanol, resulting in approximately 500,000 tons/y of methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine. The reaction is poorly selective, requiring separation of the three products. Many other industrially significant alkyl amines are produced, again on a large scale, from the alcohols. Epoxides are another class of halide-free N-alkylating agents, useful in the production of ethanolamines. Alternative alkylation methods For laboratory use, the N-alkylation reaction is often unselective. A variety of alternative methods have been developed, such as the Del√©pine reaction, which uses hexamine. The Gabriel synthesis, involving the use of an equivalent to NH2‚àí, only applies to primary alkyl halides.

He was Emeritus Professor of Psychoanalytic Studies at the California Institute of Technology Life Breger was born and grew up in Los Angeles, California. He received his undergraduate education at Cornell University and U.C.L.A., following which he obtained his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at The Ohio State University in 1961. He then taught at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California Medical School in San Francisco, and the University of Oregon. In 1970 Breger became Visiting Associate Professor of Psychology then Professor of Psychoanalytic Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division of the California Institute of Technology. He graduated from the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute in 1979, where he became a Training and Supervising Analyst and was the recipient of the Franz Alexander Essay Award and the Distinguished Teaching Award. In 1990, he resigned from that institution and, with a group of colleagues, created the Institute of Contemporary Psychoanalysis (ICP) where he was the Founding President from 1990 to 1993. ICP reflected Breger‚Äôs commitment to an open, democratic form of education: it is a non-hierarchical training institute, not affiliated with the American Psychoanalytic Association. He was the father of three grown children and two stepsons, married to Barbara Gale Breger; together, they have 13 grandchildren. Research and scholarship Breger has been both a practicing psychotherapist and a faculty member at several universities where he carried out research on dreams, reformulations of psychoanalytic theory, psychotherapy process and outcome, personality development, and the application of psychoanalysis to literature. He has also published two biographies of Sigmund Freud. He has always taken a critical stance towards psychoanalysis, as revealed in most of his publications. His work on dreaming ‚Äì using the REM techniques of monitoring sleep through the night ‚Äì showed that dreams are symbolic attempts to master emotional conflicts that have been aroused during the pre-sleep period, in contrast to Freud‚Äôs wish fulfillment theory (see Function of Dreams, 1967). His work on personality development ‚Äì as found in his book From Instinct to Identity ‚Äì is an integration of theory and research from child development, John Bowlby, Erik Erikson, Harry Stack Sullivan, Freud, Jean Piaget, primate studies, and research on hunter-gatherer societies. The study of Dostoevsky treats him as a fellow ‚Äúpsychoanalyst‚Äù who has much to teach us rather than a patient to be ‚Äúanalyzed.‚Äù The two biographical studies of Freud bring out the personal ‚Äì often traumatic ‚Äì roots of what is valuable and problematic in psychoanalytic theory and therapy.

Vortex adds accurate physical motion and interactions to objects in visual-simulation applications for operator training, mission planning, product concept validation, heavy machinery and robotics design and testing, haptics devices, immersive and virtual reality (VR) environments. The Vortex Studio content creation platform and the C++ SDK have several modules that simulate physics-based particles, sensors, floating bodies, cable systems, earthmoving operations, grasping, and vehicles (wheeled or tracked). Vortex has a modular architecture: developers can integrate their projects into 3D visualization frameworks and deploy them in environments that contain software-in-the-loop (SIL), MATLAB, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), and motion platform components. History Vortex Studio is developed by CM Labs Simulations Inc., a private company established in Montreal in 2001. CM Labs was created when the management of MathEngine Canada Inc. purchased a portion of the business from MathEngine PLC, the parent company in the UK. MathEngine Canada Inc. was originally the research and development team responsible for creating the Karma physics simulation engine for computer games. CM Labs shifted its focus away from gaming. It now supports two distinct markets, visual simulation for training (VST), targeting Vortex at robotics and heavy- equipment operator training in both commercial and military applications, and heavy equipment prototyping and engineering, targeting mostly manufacturers and academia. Vortex Studio has been under active development ever since the initial launch of the software in 2001. It usually has three releases per year (a, b and c). Use Vortex has been employed in a wide range of commercial, military, and academic projects. To date, it has been used to simulate vehicles, robotics, and heavy equipment in hundreds of construction, mining, forestry, marine, subsea, planetary, academic, and military environments. It has also been used to simulate the movements and behaviour of animals and insects for scientific purposes. Sample examples are: * The Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) robot simulator developed by the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) for training purposes. EADS uses Vortex to model the physical behaviour of the robot as it maneuvers in its simulated environment, interacting with other objects while processing user commands. * A driverless vehicle designed by Carnegie Mellon University‚Äôs Red Team Racing for the DARPA Grand Challenge that uses Vortex for preplanning and onboard navigation to ‚Äúaccurately simulate the vehicle as it navigates the terrain, including both local area constraints and global path planning objectives.‚Äù * Heavy-equipment operator training simulators such as tower crane, mobile crane, crawler crane, and concrete pump for the Operating Engineers Training Institute of Ontario and the International Union of Operating Engineers ‚Äì Local 721.

The name references cannabis consumption. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock\\". Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove-laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early 1990s and was pioneered foremost by Monster Magnet and the California bands Fu Manchu, Kyuss and Sleep.Brief History of Stoner Rock and Stoner MetalArticles @ Ultimate- Guitar.Com Terminology The descriptor \\"stoner rock\\" may originate from the title of the 1997 Roadrunner Records compilation Burn One Up! Music for Stoners. Desert rock is also used interchangeably as a descriptor, and was coined by a MeteorCity Records intern, around the time the label released the 1998 stoner rock compilation Welcome to MeteorCity. Due to the similarities between stoner and sludge metal, there is often a crossover between the two genres. This hybrid has traits of both styles, but generally lacks stoner metal's laid back atmosphere and its usage of psychedelia. Bands such as Weedeater, High on FireMusicMight: High on Fire biography and Electric Wizard creatively fuse both styles. Cannabis Influenced on psychedelic experiences induced by Cannabis (drug) The involvement of cannabis in the creation of \\"stoner rock/metal\\" can range between bands in the genre. Bands such as Sleep have involved the concept of cannabis to be part of the core of their albums and songs.\\"Sleep.\\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 February 2017 The consumption of cannabis is common in the live performances of some stoner rock/metal bands, and bands such as Electric Wizard are known to have concerts with the band members and the crowd participating in smoking cannabis.\\"Electric Wizard.\\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 February 2017. Dopesmoker (previously Jerusalem) by Sleep received controversy because the 60-minute song is about cannabis, which resulted in conflict with Sleep's record company. Some members of the genre state that \\"stoner rock is a style, not life,\\" which is interpreted as the band members do not participate in smoking cannabis or are influenced by cannabis. However, the style of their music reflects the sound of \\"stoner rock/metal.\\" Bands such as King Caravan and Sea of Green have come under terms with this statement.PANTSIOS, ANASTASIA, and SPECIAL T. THE. \\"Stoner Rock is a Style, Not Life, Says One Who Plays it.\\" The Plain Dealer, 25 May 2001, pp. 19. ProQuest Newsstand, Similarly, Matt Pike from the band High on Fire stated, \\"It's a very strong scene, but I don't think any of the stoner rock bands want to be labeled as stoner rock ... I might use the word 'stoner' in my lyrics, but I think we're metal, dude. I'd say I was crossover metal, actually, or progressive metal. It's kind of a tough thing to lump into a category, but I guess we get the stoner-rock label because of the whole pot thing.\\"DeRogatis, Jim. \\"Metal by any Other Name ... High on Fire Not 'stoners'.\\" Chicago Sun ‚Äì Times, 22 Sep 2000, pp. 5; Nc. ProQuest Newsstand, History =Influences (1960s to mid-1980s)= Like most subgenres of music, the origins of stoner rock are hard to trace and pinpoint. Nevertheless, several known progenitors and signature songs are widely credited with helping to shape the genre. Blue Cheer is considered one of the pioneers of the style; as AllMusic author Greg Prato puts it, \\"When talks about 'stoner rock' come up, one band that tends to get overlooked is Blue Cheer.\\" According to critic Mark Deming, Blue Cheer's first album, Vincebus Eruptum, \\"is a glorious celebration of rock & roll primitivism run through enough Marshall amps to deafen an army,\\" not unlike the heaviness of MC5's Kick Out the Jams and the Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat. Rolling Stone claims, \\"What stoner rock delivers, slowed down and magnified, is the riff, the persistent legacy of Mississippi blues. Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath were the first to make a monolith of it.\\" Sir Lord Baltimore have been called \\"the godfathers of stoner rock\\" and Leaf Hound have been cited for influencing countless bands in the stoner rock movement, including Kyuss and Monster Magnet. Buffalo's 1973 sophomore release Volcanic Rock has been \\"heralded as the first great stoner rock record,\\" the song Sunrise (Come My Way) \\"has since been shamelessly cannibalized for its parts by more stoner-rock bands than you can shake a bong at,\\" and the songs Till My Death and The Prophet have been likened to later stoner rock. Primevil's album Smokin' Bats at Campton's has been called a \\"touchstone\\" of stoner rock. Jim DeRogatis has said that stoner rock bands are \\"reaching back for inspiration to the psychedelic, proto-metallic jamming of bands like Cream, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Hawkwind.\\" According to DeRogatis, the roots of stoner rock can be heard on Black Sabbath's Master of Reality, Hawkwind's 25 Years On 1973‚Äì1977 box set, the aforementioned Blue Cheer album, Deep Purple's Machine Head and Blue √ñyster Cult's Workshop of the Telescopes. Black Sabbath's Master of Reality is often cited as the first album of the genre,Steve Taylor, A to X of Alternative Music, Continuum, 2006, p.199Steven Rosen, Black Sabbath ‚Äì Uncensored On the Record, Coda Books, 2011 and Martin Popoff states: \\"When 'Sweet Leaf' kicks in, one witnesses simultaneously the invention of stoner rock\\".Martin Popoff, The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time, Ecw Press, 2002, p.132 Allmusic summarizes this unique fusion as follows: \\"Stoner metal bands updated the long, mind-bending jams and ultra-heavy riffs of bands like Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Blue √ñyster Cult, and Hawkwind by filtering their psychedelia-tinged metal and acid rock through the buzzing sound of early Sub Pop‚Äìstyle grunge.\\" However, Kyuss members Josh Homme and John Garcia have shrugged off the heavy metal influence, and instead cite punk rock and hardcore punk, particularly the sludgy hardcore of Black Flag's album My War as influences. =Early development (late 1980s‚Äì1990s)= The doom metal band Trouble introduced acid rock elements on their 1990 self-titled album, which became even more prominent on 1992's Manic Frustration. Similarly, the British doom metal band Cathedral increasingly moved toward a psychedelic/stoner sound over the course of their first three releases, culminating in the critically acclaimed 1993 album The Ethereal Mirror. During this same period, heavy metal band White Zombie achieved multi-platinum success with their two major label albums, significantly expanding the heavy music audience with their groove- based, sample-laden \\"psychedelic horror\\" sound. During the early to mid-1990s, a number of southern-California bands developed the style that would be called stoner rock. In 1992, Kyuss emerged from the Palm Desert Scene with Blues for the Red Sun. Critics have hailed it as \\"a major milestone in heavy music,\\" while NME described their music as an attempt to figuratively melt \\"a hundredweight of hot desert sand into metal\\".Kyuss ‚Äì Muchas Gracias: The Best Of ‚Äì Album Reviews ‚Äì NME.COM In 1992, San Jose doom metal band Sleep released their album Sleep's Holy Mountain, and along with Kyuss were heralded by the heavy metal press as leaders of the emerging stoner scene. These two bands were among the first to introduce a psychedelic groove to their doom- influenced sound.Kyuss biography A year earlier, New Jersey's Monster Magnet released their debut album Spine of God, which displayed fewer metal influences but was psychedelic and sludgy, in the vein of their California peers. Together with these three bands, southern-Californians Fu Manchu, who released their eponymous album in 1994, are credited with being \\"one of the most enduring and influential bands\\" of the genre. In 1994, San Francisco's Acid King and Britain's Acrimony released their debut albums, both of which adopted this psychedelic approach to doom metal. Though more closely associated with the grunge movement (which itself sometimes influenced and occasionally overlapped with stoner rock), Soundgarden has also been cited as \\"stoner metal\\" or influential on the stoner rock genre, with their 1994 album Superunknown being described as a \\"stoner rock classic\\". Other influential bands from this era include Clutch, Sons of Otis and Corrosion of Conformity.Leafhound Records ‚Äì Acrimony biography =Middle years (1995‚Äì1999)= Kyuss broke up in 1995 after the release of their final album, with many members going on to develop the stoner and desert rock scene through new projects. In August 1997, Kyuss' Josh Homme founded The Desert Sessions at the now-famous Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California. This musical collective brings artists together for impromptu writing and recording sessions that yielded ten albums between 1997 and 2003. The project has included members from Kyuss, Fu Manchu, Soundgarden, Monster Magnet, Goatsnake, earthlings? and Eagles of Death Metal, as well as PJ Harvey, Dean Ween and others associated with the Palm Desert scene. Also in 1997, Roadrunner Records released the stoner rock compilation Burn One Up! Music for Stoners, which includes many of the aforementioned bands, as well as a track by Josh Homme's new band Queens of the Stone Age.In September 1997 Jadd Shickler (of stoner band Spiritu) and Aaron Emmel founded an online store based in Albuquerque, New Mexico called All That's Heavy, which began selling hard-to-find releases of Kyuss, Monster Magnet, and Fu Manchu. They soon expanded the catalog to include artists who stylistically fit with those bands. After half a year they were contacted by the former proprietor for the first Kyuss fan website, who recommended All That's Heavy do a compilation of unsigned bands that Kyuss fans would enjoy. This resulted in the formation of MeteorCity Records and the release of the compilation Welcome to MeteorCity in 1998, which included established desert and stoner rock acts, as well as new bands established by John Garcia of Kyuss, Ed Mundell of Monster Magnet, and Pete Stahl of Goatsnake. The album was the first time that the new stoner rock bands Sixty Watt Shaman, Lowrider, The Atomic Bitchwax, Dozer, Goatsnake, and Los Natas were featured on record. According to MeteorCity founders: MeteorCity soon signed a number of musicians and bands from the Palm Desert Scene, including Hermano, Unida and emerging Swedish stoner rock bands such as Lowrider, Dozer and The Mushroom River Band. During this time, The Hidden Hand and Spirit Caravan also began to gain popularity within the developing scene. =Mainstream exposure (2000‚Äìpresent)= Stoner metal band Electric Wizard (active since 1993) performing live at Hole in the Sky 2008In June 2000, Josh Homme's new project Queens of the Stone Age released their breakthrough album Rated R, which helped bring the stoner rock sound into the mainstream, despite the band themselves rejecting both the genre and their being labelled as such.QOTSA Reviews 1999/11/24-Jam!: He Ain't Joshin Songs for the Deaf, their next release in 2002, included a single from the album peaking at No. 1 on the US Modern Rock Tracks. Another label focusing on the international stoner rock scene was Small Stone Records, which released a number of compilation albums of stoner rock bands doing covers of 1970s music, including Right in the Nuts: A Tribute to Aerosmith (2000), Sucking the 70's (2002), and Sucking the 70's ‚Äì Back in the Saddle Again (2006). In 2002, the Orquesta del Desierto was formed featuring key members of the major desert rock bands, and released two albums. In 2009, the magazines Decibel and Terrorizer released issues featuring a list of the 100 greatest and most important albums of the 2000s, respectively. The stoner band Electric Wizard's Dopethrone was featured on both lists, being placed 10th on Decibel's list and 1st on the Terrorizer's one.\\"100 Greatest Metal Albums of the Decade\\", Decibel Special Collector's Edition.\\"Terrorizer's Secret History #2\\", Terrorizer Souvenir Issue. Since Kyuss' break-up, the success of the bandmates' other projects has caused the Kyuss back catalogue to become more widely listened to and their fanbase has inevitably swelled. The sound has been continued on by directly descendant bands Unida, Slo Burn, Hermano, Mondo Generator, Fu Manchu, Brant Bjork and the Bros, and at times by Queens of the Stone Age, who have since largely departed from Kyuss' stoner rock sound, and reject the label, preferring the term \\"desert rock\\". =The European Scene: Stoner Rock and beyond= Kadavar performing live at Ballenstedt RockHarz My Sleeping Karma performing live at Hellfest 2019 As acknowledged by Dave Wyndorf, the lead singer of Monster Magnet, in a 2015 interview: \\"Europe is really good for psychedelic music.\\" So much so that some US stoner rock bands will even choose to tour Europe rather than North America. Founded by a French aficionado of stoner rock, the website MoreFuzz.net has been a big promoter of the stoner rock scene in Europe and internationally. Stoner rock bands in Europe, much like their North American counterparts, mix elements of heavy rock music with psychedelia and acid rock. The influence of Black Sabbath or Blue Cheer can be heard ‚Äì among other examples ‚Äì in bands such as the Swedish Graveyard and the German Kadavar. In addition to this mix, the influence of krautrock ‚Äì such as with Kungens M√§n, a Swedish band -, or of free jazz, ‚Äì such as in the case of the Portuguese band Black Bombaim collaborating with the German free jazz saxophonist and clarinetist Peter Br√∂tzmann ‚Äì can be heard as well. While instrumental stoner rock such as Karma to Burn are rare in the US, numerous European stoner rock bands, for their part, choose to remain instrumental. This is the case of stoner rock bands such as Radar Men From The Moon from the Netherlands, Mother Engine from Germany, Black Bombaim from Portugal, My Sleeping Karma from Germany or Band in the Pit from Hungary (with some instrumental stoner rock jams exceeding 20 minutes).

Since 1997, BCT has been the only professional theater company in Boise committed to performing a complete season of contemporary work. History BCT Founder and Artistic Director Matthew Cameron Clark began producing theater in Boise, Idaho in 1996. In November of that year, along with actors he had met the previous summer working for the Idaho Shakespeare Festival, he co-produced and performed in Lone Star by James McLure in the basement of The Mode Building in Downtown Boise. When Matthew saw that there was an audience for professional contemporary theater in his home town, Boise Contemporary Theater was born and four more plays in four different venues were produced: Danny and the Deep Blue Sea by John Patrick Shanley (Neurolux and The Flying M Coffeehouse), All in the Timing by David Ives (Esther Simplot Performing Arts Academy), the World Premiere of Drive Me by Maria Dahvana Headley (Baccus Cabaret) and Lonely Planet by Steven Dietz (Stage II of The Morrison Center). Lonely Planet, in the spring of 1999, marked the first production for BCT as an official Non-Profit Organization. Boise Contemporary Theater began a capital campaign in 1999 to renovate a permanent home. Formally a seedhouse built in 1935, by October 2000, it had been transformed into a theater facility with a main-stage, classrooms, rehearsal loft and office space. The capital campaign ultimately raised $2.6 million.

It was originally created in the 1930s in the seaport of Trabzon on the Black Sea coast of north-eastern Turkey. Loosely translated, 'kolbastƒ±' means 'caught red-handed by the police.' According to legend, the name comes from nightly police patrols of the city to round up drunks, who made up a song with the lyrics: 'They came, they caught us, they beat us' (in Turkish: 'Geldiler, bastƒ±lar, vurdular'). In the past few years this dance has grown very popular and is spreading in popularity outside the region. These days this dance is mostly used for weddings or by youngsters who like to show off and attract girls. A rise in the dances' popularity outside of Trabzon has led to the belief that the dance disappeared from the region. However, it is still prevalent among youth to this day.

Origin The movement was created from the mobilization of farmers against the construction of hydroelectric plants in the region of Alto Uruguai, in the Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. In 1979 when the first studies about the hydroelectric potential of the region were published, the catholic institution Comiss√£o Pastoral da Terra (Pastoral committee for the land) organized the first meetings that ended in the creation of the Dam's committee (Comiss√£o das Barragens), later renamed as Comiss√£o Regional de Atingidos por Barragens (Regional committee of the affected by dams). In 1989 they organized their first national meeting in Goi√¢nia. In March, 1991, the first national congress of affected by dams approved the formal foundation of MAB, their actual name.

The movement defends the creation of a national fund of aid to minimize the damages caused against the people by the constructions. The organization is opposed to the Belo Monte Dam project and other similar projects in the Amazon basin.

Biography Singer was born in New York City. His parents, who were German immigrants, returned to Dresden in 1932 where his father was a Nazi and joined the Schutzstaffel. Singer's mother was Mormon but her husband forbade her from practicing her religion. They divorced in 1945 and Singer returned to the United States with his mother. Singer married Vickie Lemon in 1965 with whom he had seven children and lived on a farm in Marion, Utah in Summit County. In 1970 Singer was excommunicated from the LDS Church for not \\"sustaining the presidency.\\" In 1978 he entered into a second marriage with Shirley Black, who was still married to another man with four children. One of the main reasons Singer cited for removing his children from public school was his objection to pictures of black and white children together. The authorities did allow him to have his children home-schooled in a supervised situation. However, in 1978 his second wife's husband won custody of their children. It is unclear if it was the issue of his not giving up custody of the children or of his home schooling actions that led to the standoff where Singer was killed. In January 1979, after Singer refused to release the children, Utah law enforcement officers returned to arrest him and surrounded his home. After refusing to surrender, he reportedly pointed his pistol at the officers who then shot him multiple times, killing him.

History The Mac C√°rthaigh Riabhach seated themselves as kings of Carbery in what is now southwestern County Cork including Rosscarbery in the 13th century.Butler, \\"The Barony of Carbery\\"MacCarthy Reagh of Carbery (O'Hart 1892) Their primary allies in the initially small territory itself were O'Donovans, and members of the Ui Chairpre; both were recent arrivals, gaining their lands from the O'Mahonys of E√≥ganacht Raithlind and the O'Driscolls of Corcu Lo√≠gde. The historical record for this period is very confused and a precise sequence of events cannot be reconstructed. A portion of Carbery was conquered around 1232 by Donal Gott MacCarthy, King of Desmond, from whom the dynasty descend. His son Donal Maol Mac Carthaigh, was the first ruler of the new principality. Their descendants would expand their territories considerably and forge a small, wealthy kingdom distinct and independent from the larger Kingdom of Desmond, as well as largely independent from the Earldom of Desmond and from England, which would last into the early-mid 17th century. F√≠nghin Mac Carthaigh, the victor for Gaelic Desmond in the Battle of Callann and other campaigns, is considered to belong to the Mhic Carthaigh Riabhach, being a son of Donal Gott.√ì Murchadha 1961; 1996, p. 52 They were in frequent conflict with the line of the MacCarthy Mor, and the MacCarthys of Duhallow and Coshmaine, all of which were generally in conflict with the Fitzgeralds and FitzMaurices which comprised the lines of the Earl of Desmond and the Earl of Kildare, respectively. The dynasty became very successful during the 14th to 16th centuries, accumulating great wealth and possessing what was at times the most formidable, although not the largest army in the Desmond region. MacCarthy Reagh princes such as Florence MacCarthy were highly active in the politics and wars of Munster. A later branch from Bansha, County Tipperary, descendants of Donal of the Pipes, would relocate to Toulouse in France and be created the Counts MacCarthy Reagh of Toulouse (Comtes de Mac-Carthy Reagh).MacCarthy Reagh of Spring House (O'Hart 1892)Famille MacCarthy Reagh at GeneaWiki (French) The renowned Jesuit preacher Nicholas Tuite MacCarthy was from this line. From another branch of the dynasty descended several more lines of counts and viscounts in France. Florence MacCarthy was the compiler of Mac Carthaigh's Book,√ì hInnse 1947 and the Book of Lismore was commissioned by an earlier member of the dynasty.Duffy (ed.) 2005, pp. 279‚Äì80 The controversial Blessed Thaddeus McCarthy is believed to have belonged to the MacCarthys Reagh.√ì Murchadha 1996, pp. 53‚Äì4 The line of the Mac Carthaigh Riabhach was not represented among the Gaelic nobility of Ireland granted courtesy recognition. In the wake of the MacCarthy M√≥r scandal there remains much controversy surrounding the reestablishment of titles used more than 400 years ago. However, as several branches of the sept are known to exist today, it is possible that a legitimate successor as Chief of the Name of MacCarthy Reagh of Carbery may arise. There are a few purportedly known branches of the dynasty alive today, to include the McCarthys of Dunmanway, the McCarthys of Gortnascreeny, the McCarthys of Drinagh, and the descendants of the Bernard-Leader McCarthys listed in O'Hart's Irish Pedigrees.

However, most historians and genealogists refer to all descendants of Donal Gott as MacCarthys Reagh, and it is the case that, should the \\"senior line\\", descendants of the 5th Prince, fail, then the MacCarthys of Dunmanway would become the \\"new\\" Princes of Carbery. * Teige-an-Fhorsa MacCarthy, Lord of Glean-na-Chroim * Teige-an-Duna MacCarthy, Lord of Glean-na-Chroim ‚Äì ancestor of several surviving septs See also * Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond ‚Äì grandson of Cormac na Haoine, 10th Prince * Donal II O'Donovan ‚Äì relative through marriage, inaugurated by father-in-law Owen, 12th Prince * Sir Fineen O'Driscoll ‚Äì also son-in-law of Owen, 12th Prince * De Barry family ‚Äì neighbouring family of Welsh-Norman origin, but with whom the MacCarthys Reagh maintained generally good relations * Muskerry West and Muskerry East, baronies in central Cork that were part of the Tudor period principality of Carbery. * Francis MacCarthy Willis Bund ‚Äì a descendant of Donal Reagh MacCarthy (d. 1414), The MacCarthy Reagh, of Kilbrittain CastleNational Library of Ireland Genealogical Office Ms. 111f, fol. 125 'Copy of confirmation of arms to the descendants of John Leader MacCarthy and to his son, Francis Leader MacCarthy of Chessington, Salop., with mention of recorded descent from Donal Reagh MacCarthy \\"The MacCarthy Reagh\\" of Kilbrittain Castle, who died 1414; Sept. 17, 1937'National Library of Ireland Genealogical Office Ms. 176, pp. 459-63 'Pedigree of MacCarthy, Kings of Desmond, MacCarthy Reagh, the Bernard MacCarthys and Leader MacCarthys 1045-1937' Notes References * Butler, W.

Located on a corner site, the temple remains essentially as it was designed by Casper architect Homer F. Shaffer. The four story light-colored brick building rests on a raised basement and is topped by a crenelated parapet. The original windows have been replaced with vinyl units but retain the one-over-one appearance of the originals. Windows extend over the west and south sides. The north side is blank, while the east side is the building's rear facade and has fire escapes and a few windows. The building from the southeast in 2012 The interior is arranged, from the bottom up, as basement, a first floor, containing the ballroom, the second floor containing the lodge and banquet rooms, and a second floor balcony. The basement contains a card room and once had a two-lane bowling alley. A now-unused caretaker's apartment is on this level. A boiler room, dining room and kitchen are also found on this level. A half-story up, the main entrance opens into a vestibule with stairs descending to the basement and ascending to the first floor. A ballroom originally occupied most of the first floor, but was converted to a lodge room in 1964. A small orchestra stage was enclosed. Men's and ladies' lounges or card rooms are also on this level. The second floor contains another lodge room, a banquet hall and a kitchen. The rooms on this level have high ceilings. A balcony overlooks the lodge room. The estimated cost of the temple was $40,000. It was built by local contractor G.A. Ukensky. The ballroom and banquet hall were rented for public gatherings. By 1924 the lodge membership was 533. Homer Schaffer, the architect, practiced as an architect for only a few years between 1912 and 1915. He later became involved in furniture sales before moving to Cheyenne and becoming a car salesman after 1926. In 1931 he and his family moved to Alamosa, Colorado where he operated an electrical contracting business, designing buildings from time to time.

Life and career =Early life= Born in 1899, in Batley, England, a suburb of Leeds, Joseph was the oldest of three children born to John and Ada (n√©e Pattison) Cookman. In 1907, John, the son of a Methodist minister, was sent to Canada with his young wife Ada and two of his three young kids (the youngest child Hannah, was too sick to make the journey at the time) and became a remittance man. Shortly after they arrived, John died of appendicitis. With no money nor means to support herself, Ada put her son Joe in an orphanage at the age of 8. Subsequently, his mother got a job keeping house for a Walter Bowen and moved to his farm on Bowen-Eldridge Road in Fillmore, New York. Joe Cookman was retrieved from the orphanage and went to live with his mother and sister Grace in New York. Ada and Walter eventually would marry.Mary Gibson Bass Oral History, Project Columbia University 1976 Volume 1, page 37 Cookman graduated from a one-room school house in rural Fillmore. He went on to study at Houghton College before joining the Army, going through officer training school at Smoky Hill Flats, Kansas, and serving in World War I as a Lieutenant in the infantry. After the war, a friend's father who owned a steel mill, offered Cookman a job paying $75 per week. However, Joe did not want to be a steel salesman but a writer instead and moved to New York City settling on the upper west side. He shared an apartment with his sister Grace who had become a nurse.Mary Gibson Bass Oral History Project Columbia University 1976 Volume 1, page 34 =Married life= On November 26, 1928, Cookman married Mary Carter Carson, daughter of James Carson a former Chairman of the Colonial Trust Company. She was known professionally as Mary Bass for most of her career. They had an episcopal wedding and a reception at the Englewood Golf Club. Ushers at the wedding were newspaper men Lindsay Perrott, Ted Dibbell (NY Post), Joy Lilly and John Collins. Bass's brother was also an usher. As newly- weds, they first lived at 750 Riverside Drive in Manhattan. They later moved to the Lower East Side around 14th street, with Cookman working at the New York Post and Bass working as an advertising assistant at a department store.1930 US Census Through his work at the Sun and the Post, Cookman and Bass became close friends with Bruce Gould and Beatrice Blackmar Gould. When Bruce and Beatrix moved from the New York Post to the Ladies Home Journal in 1935, they brought Mary there the next year as an editorial assistant. She eventually was named executive editor and worked with the Goulds at Ladies Home Journal for nearly 30 years before retiring in 1963.NY Times Obituary September 8, 1996 Cookman and Bass socialized with much of the New York city literary crowd and counted Bruce Gould and Beatrice Blackmar Gould, Martha Ostenso, Ruth McKenney, Ted Dibbell, Lindsey Perrott, Bernard Grebanier, Hayward Broun among their numerous friends. This crowd used to frequent Harlem night clubs the Cotton Club and The Nest during Prohibition.

He also worked briefly at The New York Sun. Cookman was offered a job as the drama critic for the Bronx Home News. He joined the New York Evening Post in 1925 as a reporter and later as assistant city editor. He eventually became the paper's Chief Editorial Writer and worked at the Post until his death in 1944.

The first, and one of the most successful shows of its type, it confounded critics by running for 15 years and influenced successors such as the BBC's Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? and others.

It was written by Richard X and Hannah Robinson, and released as a promotional single. The song was written about former Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell. The lyrics refer to a \\"wannabe se√±orita\\" who needs to realise she has \\"got to let it go\\". The song received acclaim from music critics. The song appears on Popjustice: 100% Solid Pop Music. Background and writing \\"Me Plus One\\" was written by Richard X and Hannah Robinson in response to former Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell. Richard X and Robinson had written another song called \\"Some Girls\\", later a hit single for Rachel Stevens. Warp Records and Simon Fuller contacted Richard X by email to ask that he give the song to Halliwell or Stevens, respectively, to record. He agreed to have Stevens record the song after Richard Curtis asked about using the song for Sport Relief 2004. When Halliwell found out that the writers were having Stevens record the song, she locked herself in her car in an attempt to change their minds, and she later wrote Richard X a love song. The aftermath of the decision for Stevens to record the song became the subject of \\"Me Plus One\\" from Annie's 2004 album Anniemal. The lyrics of \\"Me Plus One\\" detail a girl who dreams of fame but cannot achieve it. She fails to be accepted into the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. The verse two says the \\"wannabe se√±orita met a group of likely girls [...] but it didn't make her happy\\", referencing the half-Spanish Halliwell's rise to stardom with the Spice Girls and her subsequent unhappiness with the group. The song's middle-eight references the \\"Some Girls\\" situation‚Äî\\"take a look at yourself, get out of the car, it's time to let go‚Äîit's gone.\\" Critical reception \\"Me Plus One\\" received acclaim from music critics. Scott Plagenhoef's review for Pitchfork Media named it \\"winking\\" and \\"seductive\\". The Stranger compared the track to The Human League, while Tiny Mix Tapes referred to the song as a \\"gorgeous day-glo dance party.\\" Stylus Magazine described the song as \\"a tale of sulky pop princesses trying to be like the Chewing Gum queen and getting smashed on the rocks\\".

The cliff is composed of carboniferous limestone and is of interest to geologists as a source of fossils and to rock climbers as a fine cliff with many interesting climbing routes. Rock climbing Craig y Forwyn reaches a height of , and rock climbers have identified and rated more than 160 routes for ascending it. The rapidity with which the rock dries makes the cliff a useful climbing venue after rain has fallen. Location The cliff lies on the west bank of the Afon Dulas, which reaches the sea at Llanddulas, and is slightly inland of the belt of carboniferous limestone that runs along the coast from Great Ormes Head to Point of Ayr, about three miles west of Abergele. The Dulas passes through a gap in the limestone belt, the strata of which dip from the north or northeast. This band of limestone is less than a mile wide. The summit of the hill is above sea level. Geology The cliff's carboniferous limestone is underlain by a seam about a foot thick of impure coal and a narrow stratum of bituminous shale. This bears impressions of fossil plants including Lepidodendron, Poacites resembling leaves, and Encrinite. Another stratum lower down the cliff is of pebbles of a greenish sandstone, and this contains fossils of bivalve molluscs as well as more sections of Encrinites.

He is known chiefly for his biography of his cousin, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and for published recollections of his close friend, Lord Byron. Early life Thomas Medwin was born in the market town of Horsham, West Sussex on 20 March 1788, the third son of five children of Thomas Charles Medwin, a solicitor and steward, and Mary Medwin (n√©e Pilford). He was a second cousin on both his parents' sides to Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792‚Äì1822), who lived two miles away at Field Place, Warnham, and with whom Medwin formed a friendship from childhood onwards.Captain Medwin: Friend of Byron and Shelley by Ernest J Lovell Jr. University of Texas 1962 Medwin was from a prosperous rather than a wealthy family that expected their sons to work for a living. He attended Syon House Academy in Isleworth in 1788‚Äì1804, as did Shelley in 1802‚Äì1808. Medwin related that Shelley and he remained close friends at Syon House, forming a bond so close that Shelley apparently sleepwalked his way to Medwin's dormitory.Life of Shelley by Thomas Medwin (1847) After a further year in a public school, Medwin matriculated at University College, Oxford in the winter of 1805, but left without taking his degree. He was initially articled as a clerk in his father's law firm in Horsham. Medwin showed aptitude in foreign languages and was to become fluent in Greek, Latin, German, Italian, Spanish, French and Portuguese. He began writing poems, including a contribution to The Wandering Jew, a poem attributed to Shelley. The young Shelley and Medwin met during their respective holidays for pursuits such as fishing and fox-hunting. Their romantic attachments included their cousin Harriet Grove, with whom Shelley was deeply committed by the spring of 1810, although he was to elope with Harriet Westbrook in 1811. Medwin rebelled against his father's wish for him to become a lawyer, causing a quarrel, the result of which was the omission of Thomas from his father's will, executed in 1829. There was a period of drift in Medwin's life, in which he attempted to live beyond his means as a gentleman. Considerable debts appear to have been paid by his family. His activities involved much carousing and gambling at his club in Brighton and spending money on collecting art. Shelley recalled Medwin as painting well and \\"remarkable, if I do not mistake, for a particular taste in, and knowledge of the belli arti ‚Äì Italy is the place for you, the very place ‚Äì the Paradise of Exiles.... If you will be glad to see an old friend, who will be glad to see you... come to Italy.\\"Percy Bysshe Shelly. Private letter to Medwin The Works X, 141. Medwin's financial situation could not continue as it was, and by 1812 he had accepted a military commission in the 24th Light Dragoons, a regiment where he could pursue his social pretensions. India Although he had no military training, Medwin was gazetted as a cornet in June 1812, joining his regiment at Cawnpore in Uttar Pradesh in northern India shortly thereafter. Cawnpore, far removed from the scene of the Gurkha or Nepal War of 1814‚Äì16, in which Medwin's regiment did not participate, was amongst the largest military stations in India, with an organised social life and stores stocked with European goods. The heat was stultifying and few duties were required of an officer. Judging from Medwin's description,The Angler in Wales, or Days and Nights of Sportsmen, 2 vols, 1834. he spent many enthusiastic hours hunting wildlife. He saw action rarely, but was present at the siege of Hathras in 1817 and involved in advances against the Pindaris on the banks of the river Sindh in December 1817. He witnessed at least one incident of sati, the ritual burning of a widow, on the Narmuda river in 1818. He enthusiastically toured the classical Hindu temples of Gaur, Palibothra, Jagannath and Karla, and the Elephanta and Ellora Caves. Medwin may have had an affair with a Hindu woman that ended badly, but through whom he was introduced to the doctrines of Rammohan Roy.Nigel Leask: British Romantic Writers and The East: Anxieties of Empire (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1992), pp. 68‚Äì70. Medwin proved a competent, rather than a commendable soldier. He suffered from dysentery, which recurred at intervals during his life. While waiting in Bombay for a berth back to England in October 1818, he rediscovered on a bookstall the poetry of his cousin Shelley, in a copy of The Revolt of Islam. Shelley was to provide the central experience and focal point of his literary life.Thomas Medwin, The Life of P. B. Shelley (2 vols, 1847) Recalling the incident under his persona Julian in The Angler in Wales in 1834, he was \\"astonished at the greatness of (Shelley's) genius\\" and declared that \\"the amiable philosophy and self-sacrifice inculcated by that divine poem, worked a strange reformation in my mind.\\" Medwin's sobriquet Julian is likely to have been a reference to Shelley's Julian and Maddolo, a poem in which Julian has characteristics of Shelley. Medwin's regiment was disbanded at the end of 1818 and Medwin went on half-pay, attached to a regiment of the Life Guards until 1831, when he sold his commission. He was by this time known as Captain Medwin, although there is no evidence that he was ever promoted beyond the rank of lieutenant. Reunion with Shelley Percy Shelley In September 1820 he arrived in Geneva to stay with Jane and Edward Ellerker Williams, the latter of whom was to drown with Shelley. There he finished his first published poem, Oswald and Edwin, An Oriental Sketch, dedicated to Williams. This ran to 40 pages with 12 pages of notes. It was revised in 1821 as the Lion Hunt for Sketches From Hindoostan. In the autumn of 1820, Medwin joined his cousin Shelley in Pisa, moving in with him and his wife Mary Shelley, with whom he was to develop an uneasy relationship. Medwin was periodically ill during his months in Pisa but worked with Shelley on a number of poems and on the publication of his journal Sketches From Hindoostan. Shelley and Medwin started to study Arabic together. They also read Schiller, Cervantes, Milton and Petrarch, and throughout early 1821 pursued a vigorous intellectual life. Shelley was working on Prometheus and would read drafts each evening to Medwin, who was continuing with a second volume of Oswald and Edwin, An Oriental Sketch. In January they were joined by Jane and Edward Ellerker Williams. Medwin left Shelley in March 1821 to visit Florence, Rome and then Venice, where he continued to write and socialise. In November 1821 he returned to Pisa. Meeting with Byron Byron Shelley introduced Medwin to Lord Byron on 20 November 1821.Conversations, Thomas Medwin p. 2 Byron was clearly impressed with the personable Medwin and they were to form a lasting friendship. They enjoyed the company of various women, as can be seen by their correspondence with each other, and formed a male bond that was missing from Medwin's relationship with Shelley. He joined Byron for episodes of pistol shooting and riding and dined within Byron's inner circle with other friends that included Shelley, Edward E Williams, Leigh Hunt and the recently arrived Edward John Trelawny. The last would feature as friend and rival throughout Medwin's life, as both sought to be arbiters of Byron's reputation. Medwin provided a translation of part of Petrarch's \\"Africa\\" for Byron,Byron's letters and Journals VI, 7: Thomas Medwin \\"Conversations\\" while Byron finished Cantos 6‚Äì12 of Don Juan. When Medwin decided to continue his tour of Italy in April 1822, Byron insisted on holding a splendid leaving party for him. Death of Shelley The impecunious Medwin travelled first to Rome, where he was introduced to the sculptor Antonio Canova,Leaves from the Autobiography of an Amateur, Thomas Medwin, Frasers's Magazine Sept 1839 and then to Naples, before sailing to Genoa. It was at Genoa that he heard a rumour of an English schooner being lost with two Englishman aboard, but only on his arrival in Geneva did he learn that it was Shelley and Edward Williams, who had drowned on 8 July 1822. Medwin was devastated and returned to Italy, where he learned at Spezia that his friends' bodies had been thrown up out of the sea. He arrived in Pisa on 18 August, a few hours after the bodies had been cremated. Throughout the rest of his life, he was bitter about being late, even claiming at one time that he had been present. He met the widows and his friends Byron, Trelawny and Leigh Hunt, who were present at Shelley's cremation, and he put the horror of those days into \\"Ahasuerus, The Wanderer\\", a poetic tribute, dedicated to Byron and laid at the feet of the dead Shelley.Ahasuerus, The Wanderer: A Dramatic Legend, in Six Parts, Thomas Medwin (London, 1823). A melancholic Medwin left Pisa shortly after to visit Genoa, Geneva, Paris, and finally London. Controversy over Byron The restless Medwin moved to Paris in 1824, where he met Washington Irving, an American author who shared his enthusiasm for Byron and the Spanish poets, particularly Calder√≥n. A lasting correspondence was formed. Shortly afterwards Medwin learned of the death of Lord Byron on 19 April 1824. The news was published in London on 15 May, and by 10 July Medwin had compiled a volume, his Conversations of Lord Byron, although the manuscript received short shrift from Mary Shelley and many other critics. John GaltBlackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Vol. 16 No. 94 (November 1824), pp. 530‚Äì540. and William Harness published negative appraisals in the November Blackwood's Magazine, and John Cam Hobhouse wrote a withering assault on Medwin for the Westminster Review of January 1825, questioning the truth of much of the book's contents. Lady Caroline Lamb, one of Byron's mistresses, was deeply upset by Medwin's comments and wrote him letters putting her view of their affair to him. John Murray (1778‚Äì1843), the Scottish publisher whose family house owned the copyright to Byron's works, was also outraged at the revelations and threatened to sue. (Murray had destroyed Byron's memoirs as being unfit for publication.) However supporters of Medwin's book included several eminent writers, including Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, who included in his edition of Edward Phillips' Theatrum Petarum Anglicanorum a memoir of Shelley, written by Medwin. Leigh Hunt, as might be expected, took a more tolerant view of Medwin in Lord Byron and his Contemporaries (1828), and since the publication of Byron's letters in Thomas Moore's biography(1830/31)Letters & Journals of Lord Byron, with Notices of his Life (vol. 1, January 1830)/(vol. 2, January 1831), Thomas Moore and Lady Blessington's Conversations (1832‚Äì1833), Medwin's recollections of Byron have come to be seen as not always faithful in detail, but essentially an accurate portrayal. Though it was a piece of populist opportunism by Medwin that affected relations with some of his friends, it proved a tremendous financial success. There were at least twelve impressions in the United States, and it was published in Germany, France and Italy. It remains in print to this day. Captain Medwin was by then famous (or infamous), well-off, and able to marry Anne Henrietta Hamilton, Countess of Starnford (a Swedish title), on 2 November 1824 in Lausanne. High life and downfall Medwin was 36 when he married and took a long honeymoon at Vevey before settling in Florence. The union produced two daughters, Henrietta and Catherine.Henrietta Medwin married an Italian aristocrat, Ferdinando Pieri Nerli, and their son, born in 1860, became known as G. P. Nerli, an artist working in the Antipodes who notably painted Robert Louis Stevenson. His other daughter Catherine also married an Italian aristocrat, Cavaliere Enca Arrighi. Medwin settled into a life of style and substance among an English √©migr√© community. Unfortunately he was still living beyond his means and lost large sums buying and selling Italian art works. By 1829, when his father died, he was in dire financial straits, with creditors repossessing his goods. His marriage came under strain, and Medwin appears to have ducked his responsibilities and abandoned his wife and two daughters, leaving friends such as Trelawny and Charles Armitage Brown to sort out his and his wife's affairs. Medwin moved to Genoa, where he worked assiduously on a play, Prometheus portarore del fuoco (Prometheus the Fire-Bearer). Though never published in English, it was translated into Italian and published in Genoa in 1830, where it was reviewed enthusiastically.Antologica magazine, July 1830. In typical fashion, Medwin dedicated the play to the memory of Shelley. Genoa, however, turned out to be only an interlude, as Medwin was expelled for writing a tragedy called The Conspiracy of the Fieschi, which alarmed the Genoese authorities, believing it to be anti-government propaganda. By January 1831 Medwin, without his family, was back in London, still hoping to earn a living as a writer.Medwin described this period of his life in \\"My Moustache\\", published in Ainsworth Magazine, I (1842), pp. 52‚Äì54. Translating Aeschylus In 1832 his Memoir of Shelley was published in six weekly instalments in The Athenaeum, with the Shelley Papers following at 18 weekly intervals until April 1833. These were collected in 1833 and published as The Shelley Papers; Memoir of Percy Bysshe Shelley. By that time Medwin was editor of the New Anti-Jacobin: A Monthly Magazine of Politics, Commerce, Science, Art, Music and the Drama, which appeared only twice, with contributions from the poet Horace Smith and John Poole, as well as the editor. Medwin had also embarked on well-received translations of Aeschylus' plays into English. Prometheus Unbound and Agamemnon appeared in companion volumes in May 1833, followed by The Seven Tribes Against Thebes, The Persians, The Eumenides and The Choephori. He did not translate The Suppliants, apparently because he disapproved of \\"its corruptions\\".Forman's edition of Shelley by Thomas Medwin, p. 243. The translations were warmly reviewed by major literary magazines, including The Gentleman's Magazine, and published in Fraser's Magazine. Some criticised him for straying from the original meaning, which he had intentionally done, where he felt the occasion demanded. Medwin's skill lay in bringing alive Aeschylus's characters through believable dialogue that uses traditional metres and measure. Medwin's output in the middle years of the 1830s was prodigious. He contributed a series of short stories to Bentley's Miscellany. He departed from his usual classical fare in The Angler in Wales, which is in the tradition of Isaac Walton's The Compleat Angler and chiefly takes the form of dialogue. It defends angling and provides insight into his love of the countryside and its pursuits. There are cameo appearances by Shelley and Byron. At the time, Medwin was earning a decent living, but not enough to repay his creditors. He announced in 1837 that he was moving to Heidelberg, then in Grand Duchy of Baden, Germany. Heidelberg In 1837‚Äì47 Medwin published 26 tales and sketches for publication in The Athenaeum and in other literary magazines. The prose he was now producing was essentially that of a traveller, with settings associated with former periods of his life: India, Rome, Switzerland, Paris, Venice, Florence and later Jena, Mannheim and Strasbourg. He became a de facto correspondent for successive magazines including The Athenaeum and The New Monthly Magazine providing impressions of all things German. He joined the influential Heidelberg museum and participated fully in the city's literary life, reviewing local theatre for English readers. He read the works of German poets including: Karl Gutzkow, Ludwig Tieck, Ludwig Achim von Arnim, Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff, Rauch and Diefenbach. The poetry of the last he translated for English readers, as part of his contribution to cross-fertilisation of cultural relations between England and Germany.Anglo-German and American-German Crosscurrents By Arthur Orcutt Lewis, W. Lamarr Kopp, Edward J. Danis He lived in Heidelberg for most of the next twenty years, although travelling regularly to Baden-Baden, the setting for much of his only novel, Lady Singleton, published in 1842. In Heidelberg he formed a deep attachment to the poet Caroline Champion de Crespigny (1797‚Äì1861),Sources differ for the birth and death dates of de Crespigny. There is a baptismal record in the register of Durham Cathedral dated 24 October 1797, whilst Probate records of 28 February 1862 record her death in Heidelberg on 26 December 1861, letters of administration having been granted to her son Albert Henry.who was the daughter of Henry Bathurst, Bishop of Norwich and niece of Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst. In 1820 she married Heaton Champion de Crespigny, an ultimately unsuccessful union that produced at least five children, but had ended by 1837 with her husband pursued by creditors. She settled in Heidelberg shortly thereafter.Letters of Julie Gmelin, 19 June 1849, published in Badische Post that describes her as a former mistress of Byron, 21 March 1924. Their relationship was essentially intellectual, as neither could afford a divorce settlement from their estranged spouses. The English colony in Heidelberg was intimate. Medwin's acquaintances there included Mary and William Howitt, who found him a man of \\"culture and refinement, aristocratic in his tastes\\"An Autobiography: Mary Howitt (London, 1891), p. 154.whilst Charles Godfrey Leland, an American folklorist who befriended Medwin in Heidelberg describes Medwin as a kindly man 'full of anecdotes, which I now wish that I had recorded'.Memoirs of Charles Godfrey Leland, Heinemann Press, London, October 1893 In the early 1840s Fanny Brawn(e) Lindon, once John Keats's lover, moved to Heidelberg, and through her Medwin was involved once again in a controversy concerning a dead, but influential English romantic poet. Medwin and Lindon collaborated to correct the impression provided by Mary Shelley in her Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments (1840) that Keats had become insane in his final days. Lindon showed letters to Medwin that suggested otherwise and Medwin used this new knowledge in his major Life of Shelley, where he published extracts from the letters by Keats himself and his friend Joseph Severn. Life of Shelley Medwin began his biography of Percy Shelley in 1845, corresponding with relatives and friends in England, including Percy Florence Shelley, the poet's son, and in 1846 requesting information from Mary Shelley. She was uncooperative, wishing to hinder publication of the biography and claiming that Medwin had attempted to bribe her with the sum of ¬£250. The work took two years to finish, appearing in September 1847. It was not a coolly dispassionate account of Shelley's life. It is passionate and opinionated, and includes attacks on Medwin's personal enemies. There are numerous errors of date, fact and quotation, some of the later outright bowdlerised. (Most of the errors were removed by Harry Buxton Forman in 1913.)Harry Buxton Forman was exposed as a forger of antique books in 1934 by John Carter and Graham Pollard in An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets.Collins, John, Two Forgers: A Biography of Harry Buxton Forman and Thomas James Wise, Oak Knoll Press, New Castle, Del., 1992. Whatever its faults, it remains a major source for the poet's early life and work. Medwin is the main source on the childhood of Shelley, a major source for the events of 1821‚Äì1822, and a mine of personal recollections. It was also the major source of knowledge in Germany of the life and work of Shelley, who since his death had become something of a divisive figure, and criticism was to be expected. Medwin's biography duly received a withering attack in The Athenaeum, which opened its review: \\"We are not in any way satisfied with this book.\\"Athenaeum, 18 September 1847 \\"The Spectator\\" wrote \\"Medwin's labours... are chiefly remarkable for the art of stuffing... nor does the author forget a scandal when he can pick any up.\\" Medwin was even more strongly reviled by the surviving members of the Pisan circle. Mary Shelley's reaction was to be expected, given her antipathy towards him, but Trelawny was equally cutting, calling the work \\"superficial\\" as late as 1870.Letters of Edward John Trelawny, quoting a letter from Trelawny to W. M. Rossetti dated 1870. However, it was received better by some critics, including William Howitt and W. Harrison Ainsworth, who began their review in Howitt's Journal by saying the subject \\"could not possibly have fallen into more competent hands.\\"Howitt's Journal II (1847) Justinus Kerner in old age Medwin returned to Heidelberg from a visit to London and Horsham in time for the 1848 Revolution that swept through Germany. He and Caroline de Crespigny took flight to a more peaceable Weinsberg in Wurttemberg. He continued to work there, producing some poetry and translations for his host, Justinus Kerner, to whom in 1854 he published a poem. He returned to Heidelberg the same year and published a further poetry volume, The Nugae. This was international in content, with original poems and translations in Greek, Latin, English, and German. A further book of poetry published in 1862 in Heidelberg was entitled Odds and Ends, with translations from Catullus, Virgil, Horace and Scaliger, and additional poems by Caroline de Crespigny, who died shortly before its publication. The book confirmed that Thomas Medwin was a learned man, but prone to be imprecise and careless. Final years Pilford Medwin Medwin, aged 72, returned finally to England in 1862 and began rewriting his \\"Life of Shelley\\", although the revision exists only in handwritten form. In 1869 he was visited by his old friend and sometime rival Trelawny, who found him constant and \\"always faithful and honest in his love of Shelley.\\"Letters of Trelawny p. 221 Thomas Medwin died on 2 August 1869 at the house of his brother Pilfold Medwin (1794‚Äì1880) in the Carfax, Horsham, where he was buried in Denne Road Cemetery. At his request, his grave faces east to India, Italy and Germany, and reads: \\"He was a friend and companion of Byron, Shelley and Trelawny.\\" Legacy Thomas Medwin's legacy tends to raise more questions than answers.Horsham's Forgotten Son: Thomas Medwin, Friend of Shelley and Byron by Susan Cabell Djabri, Jeremy Knight, Horsham District Council, Horsham Museum 1995 Was he an opportunist, who lived beyond his means and ruined his father and wife? He tended to fall out with former associates, including Shelley's widow and Trelawny. His writings on Byron and Shelley are often imprecise. Shelley's fame grew throughout the 19th century and his legacy became an obsession for Medwin, as for others in the Pisan circle. Medwin's opportunism disregarded the feelings of many former friends, but he remains the main source of information on Shelley's childhood. His Conversations of Lord Byron is now seen generally as vivid and an essentially true picture of the man. The few writers to highlight Medwin dwell on his popular writings on Shelley and Byron, but his legacy includes numerous translations from Greek, Latin, Italian, German, Portuguese and Spanish. His translations of Aeschylus are of lasting importance and his early travel writings vivid and memorable. His poetry remains neglected, with little critical comment available since their publication. His importance in the mid-19th-century cultural cross- currents between Britain, the United States and Germany has only recently been assessed. Medwin introduced many German writers to the English-speaking world, notably the poets Karl Gutzkow, Ludwig Tieck and Ludwig Achim von Arnim. He \\"deserves to be reassessed in the light of the new evidence that is now available.\\" Selected bibliography Conversation of Lord Byron, 1824 *Oswald and Edwin, an Oriental Sketch (Geneva 1821) *Sketches in Hindoostan with Other Poems (London 1821) *Ahasuerus, The Wanderer; Dramatic Legend in Six Parts (London 1823) *The Death of Mago translated from Petrarch's Africa; in Ugo Foscolo, Essays on Petrarch (London 1823) pp. 215 and 217 *Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron (Noted during a residence with his Lordship at Pisa, in the Years 1821 and 1822, London, 1824) *Prometheus Bound (translated from Aeschylus), Siena 1927; London 1832; Fraser's Magazine XVI (August 1837), pp. 209‚Äì233 *Agamemnon (translated from Aeschylus), London 1832; Fraser's Magazine XVIII (November 1838), pp. 505‚Äì539 *The Choephori (translated from Aeschylus), Fraser's Magazine VI, (London 1832), pp. 511‚Äì535 *The Shelley Papers, Memoirs of Percy Bysshe Shelley (London, 1833) *The Persians (translated from Aeschylus), Fraser's Magazine VII (January 1833) pp. 17‚Äì43 *The Seven Against Thebes (translated from Aeschylus), Fraser's Magazine VII (April 1833) pp. 437‚Äì458 *The Eumenides (translated from Aeschylus), Fraser's Magazine IX (May 1834) pp. 553‚Äì573. *The Angler in Wales, or Days and Nights of Sportsmen (London 1834) *The apportionment of the world, from Schiller, translated by Thomas Medwin, Bentley's Miscellany IV p. 549 (December 1837) *The Three Sisters.

Description  The black sea hare can grow to be very large: the longest recorded specimen measured when crawling (and thus fully extended), and weighed nearly .Sea Slugs: Aplysia vaccaria. Retrieved 25 February 2015. Unlike Aplysia californica, the body of this species is relatively firm, and the parapodia are joined behind the siphon. Unlike many other members of the same family and genus, this species is incapable of producing ink.  Feeding habits  All Aplysia species are herbivorous. This species eats brown seaweeds and kelp, which give the animal its typically very dark coloration.  Life cycle and behavior  Aplysia vaccaria have a life cycle of one year.Angeloni, L., and J. Bradbury. \\"Body size influences mating strategies in a simultaneously hermaphroditic sea slug, Aplysia vaccaria.\\" Ethology Ecology & Evolution 11.2 (1999): 187-195. They grow very quickly, at an average rate of 4.9 grams per day.Angeloni, L. I. S. A., J. A. C. K. Bradbury, and A. L. E. X. I. S. Chaine. \\"Growth, seasonality, and dispersion of a population of Aplysia vaccaria Winkler 1955.\\" VELIGER-BERKELEY- 42 (1999): 1-9. This high rate of growth makes sense given that Aplysia vaccaria is the largest known species of sea slug.\\"California Black Sea Hare, Aplysia vaccaria\\". nathistoc.bio.uci.edu. Retrieved 2019-01-04 Aplysia vaccaria is a herbivore which feeds on brown algae, which is notable given that its close relative Aplysia californica feeds almost exclusively on red algae.Midland, Sharon L., Richard M. Wing, and James J. Sims. \\"New crenulides from the sea hare, Aplysia vaccaria.\\" The Journal of Organic Chemistry 48.11 (1983): 1906-1909. This difference in food sources likely minimizes competition between the two species, which share much of the same habitat. Aplysia vaccaria is found in the intertidal and upper- subtidal zone, meaning that it can survive exposure to air while the tide is out. Aplysia vaccaria is rarely preyed upon by other organisms, which has made it the subject of various experiments testing for a secreted bio-toxin that discourages predation. The large size of Aplysia vaccaria also contributes to its lack of predators. It‚Äôs simply too big for many predators to attack or consume.  Mating habits  Aplysia vaccaria is a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Simultaneous hermaphrodites are organisms that have both male and female sex organs that are able to contribute to sexual reproduction at the same time, which is distinct from non-simultaneous hermaphrodites which only have one sex organ present or functional at any one point in time. Being simultaneously hermaphroditic is advantageous because any two individuals are able to reproduce with one another, which facilitates Aplysia vaccaria finding a mate. However, despite having both sex organs functional during reproduction, only one Aplysia vaccaria acts as a sperm donor during the mating encounter. Which individual acts as the sperm donor is dependent upon the relative sizes of the two individuals. The smaller individual most often acts as the sperm donor, while the larger individual acts as the sperm recipient. Because the reproductive role of Aplysia vaccaria is dependent on the relative sizes between a mating pair, one individual can act as both a sperm donor and a sperm recipient during a mating season. It has been suggested that larger individuals are preferentially selected for mating, and they act as the sperm recipient to avoid the competition present between smaller individuals to be sperm donors. This mechanism of size-assortative mating is common among gastropods. There is circumstantial evidence to suggest cross-fertilisation between Aplysia vaccaria and smaller teroir slugs in stagnant rock pools, though this is based on anecdotal evidence and has never been independently verified.  Production of defense substances  The scarcity of natural predators for sea hares has long suggested to scientists that some kind of toxin must be produced to discourage predation. Unlike most members of its family, Aplysia vaccaria is incapable of producing ink. The absence of this defense mechanism while maintaining a very low level of predation further suggests that Aplysia vaccaria is protected by a secreted toxin effective enough that the production of ink for defense purposes was no longer evolutionarily beneficial. Sea hares form their toxins from compounds they receive from their food source.Winkler, Lindsay R. \\"Preliminary tests of the toxin extracted from California sea hares of the genus Aplysia.\\" (1961). This is significant because the type of algae the sea hare eats will determine the toxin it produces. Aplysia vaccaria primarily feeds on brown algae, meanings its toxins are derived from this source and are distinct from sea hares such as Aplysia californica which feeds on red algae. Food source also determines the color of the sea hare, which explains why Aplysia vaccaria appears black or dark brown while Aplysia californica appears red. In order to discourage predation by fish, brown algae produces the toxin acetoxycrenulide. During digestion, Aplysia vaccaria extracts this compound and allows it to accumulate in its tissue. Because acetoxycrenulide is highly toxic to fish, its presence in Aplysia vaccaria is sufficient to discourage predation.  References  * Bebbington A.

Autohaemorrhaging, or reflex bleeding, is the action of animals deliberately ejecting blood from their bodies. Autohaemorrhaging has been observed as occurring in two variations. In the first form, blood is squirted toward a predator. The blood of these animals usually contains toxic compounds, making the behaviour an effective chemical defence mechanism. In the second form, blood is not squirted, but is slowly emitted from the animal's body. This form appears to serve a deterrent effect, and is used by animals whose blood does not seem to be toxic. Most animals that autohaemorrhage are insects, but some reptiles also display this behaviour. Some organisms have shown an ability to tailor their autohaemorrhaging response. Armoured crickets will projectile autohaemorrhage over longer distances when attacked from the side, compared to being attacked from an overhead predator.

History 48 Hudson Avenue pictured when it was the Jared & C.B. Holt leather store. 48 Hudson Avenue was built by Johannes van Ostrande in 1728 just outside the stockade walls and a few hundred yards from the old Fort Orange. Van Ostrande was a member of the Albany Common Council representing the First Ward, and in the 1750s sold the building to Johannes Radliff, a shoe-maker. During the 19th century the building was the home, and later factory, of Jared Holt. Holt made waxed thread used for sewing leather goods. Future 48 Hudson Avenue sits within the core area of the proposed Albany Convention Center. The Albany Convention Center Authority has worked with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to preserve the structure, mitigate adverse impacts, and recover archaeological resources. The Authority has also spoken with the owner of 48 Hudson Avenue regarding efforts to preserve the building. Structure As originally built it was a -story building, with a steep gable roof of fifty- four degrees. The house measured 23 by 33 feet with one large first-floor room and two lofts. The first floor was brick, while the top portion was pine shakes. The building has many rare features not often preserved in other buildings from its time, including a molded anchor beam, the outline of a jambless fireplace, wide pine exterior siding, wide floorboards, steeply pitched roof beams, and original brick walls.

Rising costs and the threat of World War II, however, derailed the scheme, and eventually the entire complex was dismantled and recycled for the war effort. = 1958: Casa Ma√±ana returns = The dream of Casa Ma√±ana was reborn in the fall of 1957 by the Fort Worth Opera Association's president, James H. Snowden, Jr., and manager, Melvin O. Dacus. At their request, the city of Fort Worth created a non-profit corporation to build and operate a theatre complex, primarily focused on the production of Broadway musicals. With a budget of $500,000, the project was approved by the city council on January 14, 1958. Construction began on March 13, and a record-breaking 114 days later Casa Ma√±ana Theatre was completed as a fully enclosed, air-conditioned, aluminum-domed theatre. The theatre's black-tie opening with a production of Can-Can on July 5, 1958, introduced audiences to the 1,805-seat house and to theatre-in-the-round, a stage configuration featuring a stage surrounded by the audience. With no backstage area, the actors and stagehands would use the surrounding concourse and aisles to move set pieces, props and other materials on and off stage. = Casa Ma√±ana through the years = Casa Ma√±ana Musicals, Inc., the non-profit organization that managed the theatre, was run by a volunteer board of directors and General Manager Melvin O. Dacus. In 1962, programming was expanded with the introduction of the Children's Playhouse, a professional theatre series geared toward North Texas children. Each year since, nearly 150,000 parents, children, teachers and students have attended these popular shows. Soon after the Children's Playhouse was established, Casa Ma√±ana's Theatre School opened to train children in the performing arts. Today, classes for children ages four and older are taught by theatre professionals year- round in acting, musical theatre, dance and voice. With the opening of the Nancy Lee & Perry R. Bass Performance Hall in 1998, Casa Ma√±ana Musicals, Inc. began presenting Broadway national tours year round at the new facility, in addition to staging their own elaborate productions, often featuring stunning local talent. New programs have been added to Casa's Education & Outreach programs, including The Betty Lynn Buckley Awards, honoring excellence in high school musical theatre, a summer theatre school program called Camp Casa, and an outreach performance troupe, The Casa Playaz to complement Casa Kids in bringing the magic of live theatre to the community. After a decade of planning and fundraising, Casa Ma√±ana Theatre was renovated in 2003. The renovation also added space for the expansion of Casa's educational programs and for the accommodation of community meetings, performances and other events. In 2004, recognizing that the title ‚ÄúMusicals‚Äù did not accurately reflect the broad contributions the organization was making to the North Texas community, the board of directors voted to officially change the company's name to Casa Ma√±ana, Inc.

Partridge. The current building is the fifth for the county. The courthouse is included within the bounds of the Urbana Monument Square Historic District, but is not a contributing property. History Champaign County was established in 1805 and the county seat was placed at Springfield. Until 1807 the courts met in the home of a local citizen, George Fithian. Unfortunately, most of the county records relating to this period of history were lost. The county seat was removed to Urbana in 1807. Even though land was set aside for a courthouse on a public square, the courthouse was built elsewhere. This structure was a simple log house which was converted into a private home after the court relocated. During the War of 1812 the courthouse was used as an army hospital and the court was removed to the upper story of the county jail. This arrangement continued until 1817 when a new courthouse was finished. The county decided on a new courthouse and construction began on the public square in 1814 and was completed in 1817. This two-story brick structure had a central entrance located on the front facade and a central bell tower. The bell would ring to alert local citizens of public meetings, fires, births or deaths. A special club was used in the most important events and produced a distinctive high pitched tone. The county decided to build a new courthouse in 1837 and chose a site once again removed from the public square. The site chosen was the corner of North Main Street and East Court Street, which is still the present site of the courthouse. This courthouse was designed by the architectural firm of Hall and Sheldon and was completed ahead of schedule in 1839. This two-story brick structure was later remodeled in 1880 after it was deemed to be dangerous. The remodeling used the plans of the courthouse in Hillsboro right down to the new classical portico with Ionic columns and belltower. This new remodel was considered by many to fireproof the building. This was to be proved wrong on January 20, 1948, when a fire completely destroyed the building. The fire of the courthouse placed the county in a bind. With no money in the budget for construction, several ballots were voted on to raise funds but were all defeated. A group of citizens campaigned for a final bond which passed with a sum of $650,000. This was not enough so the county officials decided to pay for the cost to equip the courthouse out of the county's fund which left restricted spending for several years. Architect Phillip Partridge was selected to design the fifth courthouse. He designed the building in the International style of the 1950s. The building was dedicated to much ceremony on June 8, 1957. Attending this ceremony was Governor C. William O'Neill, whose speech preceded the open house. Exterior The courthouse called for four floors but this was deleted after realizing this would cost too much. The building is constructed in International style, which calls for little or no external decoration. The walls are made up of red brick with large rectangular window panels. The recessed entrance is reached by a flight of stairs and is framed by 4 large square pillars of granite blocks.

Cyprus has a rich flora and a diverse fauna albeit with relatively few mammals. Like most modern countries, the natural habitats in Cyprus have been steadily disappearing, currently retaining only 20% of its original habitat due to rapid urbanization, usage of forests for commercial purposes, tourism and various other reasons. One of the unique features of Cyprus' habitats is the wild and sharp differences in elevations and habitats in different parts of the island as well as different climate conditions, all of which supply a diverse habitat for a unique array of fauna and flora. Fauna =Amphibians= The fauna of Cyprus has four amphibians. =Birds= Cyprus also has over 380 identified species of bird due to being on migration routes between Africa to Europe and western Asia including Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae), flamingo and the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca). There are two endemic species of songbirds, the Cyprus warbler (Sylvia melanothorax) and the Cyprus wheatear (Oenanthe cypriaca). Both only breed on the island of Cyprus and migrate south to overwinter. =Mammals= Cyprus is currently home to 21 known mammals, of which three are endangered. The largest wild animal and mammal currently residing in Cyprus is the endemic Cypriot mouflon. Other notable mammals are the large critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal and the endemic Cypriot mouse, which is the only remaining endemic rodent on the Mediterranean islands. =Reptiles= Most of the reptiles of Cyprus are harmless, and non-venomous such as the Cyprus whip snake (Hierophis cypriensis) and the European blind snake (Typhlops vermicularis). Other snakes, European cat snake (Telescopus fallax) and Montpellier snake (Malpolon monspessulanus) are nominally venomous, but neither aggressive nor particularly dangerous. In contrast, the Cyprian blunt- nosed viper, (Macrovipera lebetina lebetina), though not aggressive, is a large, front-fanged viper. Its bite is dangerous even to large mammals, including people.Atat√ºr, M. K and G√∂√ßmen, B. (2001).

Three of the reptile species on Cyprus, including Macrovipera lebetina, are endangered. Cyprus has several species of lizards and a few species of turtles such as loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta, (Linnaeus, 1758)). =Arachnids= Cyprus has an especially wide array of arachnids with around 60 species of spiders, including such spectacular spiders as the European tarantula (Lycosa tarantula). Flora The flora of Cyprus contains about 1800 species, of which circa 128 are endemic. The flora also include invasive species such as prickly pears and the yellow oxalis.

Gameplay In-game screenshot (BBC Micro) The game's play centers on the player's character of the Doctor (specifically his sixth incarnation), and his robotic programmable cat Splinx. The goal of the game is to halt the Master's production of Heatonite, retrieve stolen plans for the Time Lords, and return safely. The game's screen always has the player in the center, and depending on the direction of movement, the entire screen scrolls horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player can move freely, but can die in many ways: monster attack, robot attack, too great a fall, forced regeneration, lack of oxygen, and sharp spikes. Enemies include patrolling robots that resemble the Daleks; however, the actual name and exact design of the Daleks was not used due to the rights to them being part owned by Terry Nation, creator of the Daleks.https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/doctor-who/238741/a-timey-wimey- history-of-doctor-who-games Development and release The game began life as a sequel to the hit BBC Micro game Castle Quest, and was adapted into a Doctor Who game mid-development. As it was too large to fit into the standard memory of the BBC Micro, it came with its own ROM chip which had to be installed for the game to run in conjunction with game's main disk. This also caused problems for the unreleased (but heavily previewed and advertised) ZX Spectrum version which would have required an add-on cartridge. The costs associated with producing this game are often cited as crippling Micro Power who folded soon after its release. Reception Zzap!64's reviewers noted the game's similarity to Castle Quest.

Detroit & Cleveland Navigation Co., 326 U.S. 236 (1945), is a Supreme Court of the United States administrative law case holding that the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) had sufficient authority to order an expansion of automobile carrier capacity in anticipation of post-war demand.. Background An application during World War II had been jointly filed by the T. J. McCarthy Steamship Company and Automotive Trades Steamship Company with the ICC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) to operate as a common carrier of automobile transportation services from Detroit, Michigan, to other ports on the Great Lakes. The application was opposed by two carrier companies that had provided this service prior to the war. During the war, production of automobiles for civilian use had stopped and the federal government had requisitioned many of the automobile carrying vessels of the companies for conversion to and use as commodity carriers, but the carriers were believed to be suitable for conversion back to automobile carriers after the war. The ICC, in granting the application, found that there was insufficient capacity prior to the war, and there would likely be a need for additional capacity for post-war service. On appeal in the United States District Court for Michigan, the court reversed the order of the ICC on the basis that there was no evidence that the vessels of the two companies were the only ones available to meet any future demand, and that there were no other vessels that could be chartered. Court's decision The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the district court, holding that the ICC could authorize additional capacity, and that it had found that the existing carrying capacity on the Great Lakes was deficient prior to the war. The opinion stated, \\"The Commission is the guardian of the public interest in determining whether certificates of convenience and necessity shall be granted. For the performance of that function the Commission has been entrusted with a wide range of discretionary authority.\\" Part of this authority included authorizing increases in capacity based on forecasts.

For example, the frequency one octave above 40 Hz is 80 Hz. The term is derived from the Western musical scale where an octave is a doubling in frequency. Specification in terms of octaves is therefore common in audio electronics. Along with the decade, it is a unit used to describe frequency bands or frequency ratios.Levine, William S. (2010).

It is a large Gothic Revival church built between 1885 and 1890. Foundation The first post-reformation Roman Catholic church was opened in Cambridge in 1841; St Andrew's Catholic Church (later dismantled and re-built in St Ives) remained the only chapel available for Roman Catholics in Cambridge until the construction of OLEM. In 1865, the parish priest Canon Thomas Quinlivan acquired additional adjacent land, but the funds could not be raised for construction. With the aid of the Duke of Norfolk, the entire Lensfield estate was purchased in 1879. The task of raising more funds fell to Quinlivan's successor, Mgr Christopher Scott. On the Feast of the Assumption, 1884, the former ballerina Yolande Lyne-Stephens, widow of Stephens Lyne-Stephens, who was reputed to be the richest commoner in England, offered to provide the ¬£70,000 for the construction of a church on the site (equivalent to ¬£ million in ). The building work was undertaken by Rattee and Kett, and began in 1885, following the plans of the architects Dunn and Hansom, and the foundation stone was laid in June 1887. The construction of a new Roman Catholic church on such a prominent site, as well as its dedication to the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, caused much controversy among local Anglicans and members of the University. Despite this, and the ill health of Mrs Lyne-Stephens, the church was completed and then consecrated on 8 October 1890. The first Mass was attended by all the Roman Catholic bishops of England and Wales except for Cardinal Manning and Bishop Vaughan. History After its opening, the church saw a great rise in the number of Catholics in the parish. This was partly due to Fr Robert Benson's reputation as a preacher, as well as Mgr Scott's work as parish priest. OLEM also hosted the 1921 Bible Congress, the greatest Catholic gathering in Cambridge since the English Reformation. Between 1922 and 1946, the church was used by the Cambridge Summer School of Catholic Studies. In a 1941 air raid, a small bomb struck the sacristy, blowing a six-foot hole in the roof and another in the wall of the Sacred Heart chapel. The blast also shattered most of the windows and collapsed part of the organ gallery. The repairs, including replacement windows to the original designs, cost at least ¬£35,000 (equivalent to ¬£ million in ). Architecture The building, one of the largest Catholic churches in the United Kingdom, is designed in the Gothic revival style and follows the traditional cruciform layout. It features a polygonal apse and a central lantern tower. The construction includes Casterton stone for the foundation, Ancaster for the plinth, and the remainder in Combe Down. The interior is constructed in Bath stone, Plymouth marble and Newbiggin stone. The spire, the tallest in Cambridge, reaches 214 feet (65 m) and can be seen for a distance of several miles. The stained glass windows depict, among other things, dedications of Cambridge Colleges and scenes from the lives of English martyrs, in particular St John Fisher. To bring the sanctuary in line with the liturgical directives resulting from the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), its design and re-ordering was done by Gerard Goalen of Harlow. On 7 April 1973, Charles Grant, the Bishop of Northampton, consecrated the present central altar. The original high altar has subsequently been used mainly for reservation of the Blessed Sacrament. The church is a Grade II* listed building. =Rectory= The rectory is immediately to the south of the church and dates from around 1890. It is in the Tudor style, of red brick with stone dressings and a castellated slate roof. It is a Grade II listed building. Ancient statue The church houses a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary which is believed to date from at least the 15th century. Although evidence is inconclusive, the statue, which was discovered at Emmanuel College in 1850, is supposedly the same statue that Cromwell ordered to be removed on 30 August 1538. Experts disagree over the exact date of the craftsmanship, with the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments dating it as \\"mid-16th century\\". Music The Choir of Our Lady and the English Martyrs is semi-professional and includes former university choral scholars. A second choir, the Schola Cantorum, sings almost exclusively in Latin, and sings polyphony and Gregorian chant in the weekly solemn Latin Mass. The organ was built in 1890 by Abbott and Smith to a specification by the composer Charles Villiers Stanford. The organ was renovated in 2002 by Nicholson & Co Ltd. The belfry houses a ring of eight bells hung for change ringing, with a ninth for the Angelus. All the bells were cast in 1895 by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough.

The Space Report is the definitive overview of the global space industry and serves as a valuable resource for government and business leaders, educators, financial analysts, students, and space-relatedbusinesses.http://www.spacefoundation.org/programs/research-and- analysis/space-report Following are major findings from the 2013 issue. The global space economy grew to $304.31 billion in commercial revenue and government budgets in 2012, reflecting growth of 6.7 percent from the 2011 total of $285.33 billion. Commercial activity - space products and services and commercial infrastructure - drove much of this increase. From 2007 through 2012, the total has grown by 37 percent. Commercial space products and services revenue increased 6.5 percent since 2011, and commercial infrastructure and support industries increased by 11 percent. Government spending increased by 1.3 percent in 2012, although changes varied significantly from country to country, with India, Russia and Brazil increasing budgets by more than 20 percent, while other nations, including several in Europe, experienced declines of 25 percent or more. 78 launch attempts took place in 2012, a drop of 7.1 percent from the 84 launches in 2011 (but higher than the 2010 total of 74). Russia led with 24 launches, China had 19 launches and the United States totaled 13 launches. For the second year running, the Chinese launch rate was greater than that of the United States. The United States led in terms of launch vehicle diversity, however, with ten types of orbital rockets launched in 2012. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, the size of the U.S. space workforce declined for the fifth year in a row, dropping 3.8 percent, from 252,315 in 2010 to 242,724 in 2011 (the most recent full year for which data is available) - a decrease of about 9,500 workers. However, the changes varied by sector, with some portions of the space industry growing while others contracted. The United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s civil servant workforce decreased from 18,709 in fiscal year (FY) 2012 to 18,167 in FY 2013, a drop of 2.9 percent. However, there is evidence that the employment situation in areas with significant Space Shuttle-related layoffs, including Florida, is beginning to improve. Both Europe and Japan saw increases in space workforces; the European industry workforce showed very modest growth in 2011; in Japan, the overall workforce grew by 7.5 percent, while employment at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Japan's government space agency, dropped.  The Space Foundation Index  As of December 2012, the Space Foundation Index was 40.95 percent above its value at inception in June 2005. The Space Foundation Index and Space Foundation Services Index both outperformed the S&P; 500 and the NASDAQ during 2012, while the Space Foundation Infrastructure Index did not perform as well as the NASDAQ, but slightly better than the S&P; 500\\\\. These indexes, which are updated daily on the Space Foundation website, are easy-to-understand mechanisms for gauging the financial performance of space industry companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges.

Founded by Vidal Suriel in 1997, with its first brand reaching the market in 2000, the company was at one point the fifth top tobacco company in the United States. Known for the Bronco, Silver, and GT-One brands, General Tobacco specialized in low-cost brands, but the company's market share was undercut in its final years of production by other discounters. In addition, the company was a late participant in the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, joining the agreement nearly six years after the agreement was originally put in place. The company later claimed that while joining the agreement was essential to have access to the American market, by signing late they were forced to pay a larger amount than the 19 original signatories, and that it was \\"misled\\" into participating. The company was eventually barred from selling its brands in several states because it was unable to meet back payments for cigarette sales before 2004, as was required by the agreement. Due to these and other factors, General Tobacco ceased production at the end of 2010, although representatives of the company were still pursuing legal options as recently as 2012.

It was located on the main line from Bristol to South Wales. It was served by stopping trains to Severn Beach (via Pilning), Avonmouth (via Chittening) and Swindon (via Badminton). History The station was opened in 1927 by the Great Western Railway. The station passed to the Western Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was closed by the British Railways Board in 1964. Location Horfield railway station was located immediately to the south of the road that is now named Bonnington Walk.Geographia Street plan of Bristol c.1937 Current site Trains running between Bristol Temple Meads, Filton Abbeywood and Bristol Parkway pass the site.

Six are additionally designated as National Historic Landmarks (NHLs), the most of any city in the state after New York City. Another 14 are historic districts, for which 20 of the listings are also contributing properties. Two properties, both buildings, that had been listed in the past but have since been demolished have been delisted; one building that is also no longer extant remains listed. The listed properties represent approximately 250 years of the city's history, from its 17th-century Dutch colonial origins to its suburban expansion in the mid-20th century. Reflecting Albany's position as New York's state capital are the main buildings of all three branches of state government. City Hall, the main offices of the city's school district, and the diocesan cathedrals of both the Episcopal and Roman Catholic churches are also included. Some properties are recognized at least in part for unique attributes, such as the possible grave of the only British peer buried in the United States, the only destroyer escort still afloat and the only fireplace in that style remaining in the country. Others recognize historic firsts such as the discovery of electrical inductance, the first state government building in the country to house an educational agency and the first basketball game played outside Massachusetts, where the sport was invented. Prominent architects represented include nationally prominent figures such as Henry Hobson Richardson, Richard Morris Hunt, Richard Upjohn and Stanford White, as well as local ones like Marcus T. Reynolds. In addition to the architects and many state politicians, historic personages associated with the listed properties include George Washington, John McCloskey and Legs Diamond. Overview The National Register of Historic Places, the U.S. national heritage register, was established by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. It is administered by the National Park Service (NPS). Properties to be listed are usually first approved by the state historic preservation offices for listing on their state-level heritage register and then nominated to the National Register. Sometimes they are nominated directly to the National Register. In New York the board is under the auspices of the state's Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. A separate NPS program has jurisdiction over properties nominated for National Historic Landmark status, which must be formally granted by the Secretary of the Interior. There is no requirement that a property nominated for NHL status previously have been listed on the Register, although many were. NHLs that were not previously listed on the Register are listed administratively when they are designated NHLs. The NHL program predates the Register by a few years, and NHLs that had been designated prior to the establishment of the Register were administratively listed when the latter was established. =Geographical distribution= Outside the city, Albany County has another 148 listings. The city's 68 are 31 percent of the 214 total, the largest portion of any community in the county. One listing, the Albany Felt Company Complex, is shared with the neighboring town of Menands. Two of the listings, the USS Slater and Whipple Cast and Wrought Iron Bowstring Truss Bridge, were moved to Albany from other locations. Most of the listed properties are located in central Albany, close to the Hudson River and the original boundaries of the city, an area today largely coterminous with one listing, the Downtown Albany Historic District. The south end of the Albany Felt Company Complex in the city's northeast corner is its easternmost listing. Near the city's southern boundary, overlooking Interstate 787, is Nut Grove, the southernmost entry. The Rapp Road Community Historic District, in an area rural for much of its existence until the development of Crossgates Mall nearby, is at the western and northern extreme.These can be verified by clicking on the OpenStreetMap or Google Maps links below. The downtown historic district takes those boundaries from the stockade built by the Dutch as part of Fort Orange in 1624. The mostly buried remnants of the fort are one of the city's NHLs,Huey, Paul; , National Park Service; May 5, 1993; retrieved August 27, 2011. and the oldest of its Register listings. Until the late 19th century, downtown and its neighboring areas was the entire developed city. =Historic districts= Historic districts are groupings of properties, usually under different ownership, that share a common historical background. They are sometimes recognized by local zoning codes. Not all are actually called historic districts‚Äîin Albany, the small \\"Broadway Row\\" of four townhouses is officially listed as Buildings at 744‚Äì750 Broadway. There are 14 historic districts listed on the Register in the city. All but twoThe Lustron Houses of Jermain Street is further southwest, closer to the Harriman State Office Complex, and Rapp Road is near the Albany Pine Bush preserve in the city's western extension. of them districts are clustered, contiguously in some areas, in this same section of the city along the river. The districts range in size from Washington Park to Broadway Row, Knox Street and the Lustron Houses of Jermain Street, all less than an acre (4,000 m2).The nomination form for the Broadway Row does not give any area, but the four rowhouses, all depicted in the photo with the listing, have a combined footprint of less than half the small city block they occupy. Combined, the historic districts equal , about 4% of Albany's total land area. They have over 2,000 buildings, structures, objects or sites within their boundaries. Over 90% of those are considered contributing properties to their districts' historic character.With one exception, these figures are derived from the numbers given in their nomination forms, at the time of those nominations, which date back as far as 1980. Some districts, particularly the South End, have lost some of their significant properties to neglect in the meantime. In particular, the small Broadway‚ÄìLivingston Avenue Historic District north of downtown, had 20 buildings and a railway bridge as contributing properties when listed. , 11 of the buildings have been demolished, so this very small district was counted as having the nine buildings it actually does. Also, the nomination form for Center Square/Hudson‚ÄìPark, does not include an enumeration of the total properties in the district, much less distinguish between contributing and non-contributing properties, so it was not included in this count. Most of the districts are primarily residential enclaves, with some other uses scattered throughout. They reflect different stages of the city's growth, from onetime neighborhoods of the city's wealthy like the Ten Broeck Triangle to immigrant-settled areas like the Mansion District and South End. The two exceptions are downtown, primarily commercial,Harwood and O'Brien, 8. and the government buildings, monuments and parks that make up most of the Lafayette Park Historic District. Property types and use Of the remaining 43 extant listings, all but three are buildings or complexes of buildings. Those other three include one structure (the Whipple Cast and Wrought Iron Bowstring Truss Bridge), one maritime site (the USS Slater) and one archeological site (Fort Orange). The historic districts include some other structures, such as the parks that give two of them their names,Lafayette and Washington parks. Some smaller parks are included in the other historic districts. and objects like the statues near the state capitol and one of the city's remaining trolley poles, among their contributing properties. Five listed buildings are vacantAlbany Union Station, Church of the Holy Innocents, Stephen and Harriet Myers Residence, Old Post Office and the United Traction Company Building and one, the Abrams Building, remains listed despite its demolition in 1987. =Government and military= Reflecting Albany's status as New York's capital, 17 of the 41 extant buildings listed individually, more than one-third of that total, have been used for governmental purposes at some point.Six‚ÄîCity Hall, Hook and Ladder No. 4, the State Education Department Building, the New Scotland Avenue Armory, Court of Appeals Building and state capitol‚Äîare purpose-built government structures still in use by the governments that built them. The Delaware and Hudson Building, governor's mansion and Schuyler Mansion were privately built and later acquired by the state. Albany Academy's former building was acquired by the school district for use as its main office in the 1930s; it has also annexed the James Hall Office to one of its elementary schools. In the other direction, the city has sold the Harmanus Bleecker Library and Quackenbush Pumping Station, while the state no longer owns the Washington Avenue Armory. Two of the non-building listings, Fort Orange and the Slater, were also originally built by governments. The city government is responsible for three of those, its school district for two and the federal government one (the Old Post Office), with the rest accounted for by state government. Among the latter are the main buildings of all three branches of state government: the governor's mansion (executive), Court of Appeals Building (judicial) and the state capitol (legislative). In only three other states is this so.Minnesota, Ohio and South Carolina. Among the contributing properties to the historic districts are two buildings representing the federal and county governments, both courthouses. The 1934 Art Deco James T. Foley United States Courthouse, in the downtown district, houses the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York as well as the local office of some other federal law enforcement agencies. When built it also replaced the Old Post Office. It is the only building used by the federal government among the Register listings in Albany. In 2020 it was listed on the Register individually. Albany County government does not account for any individually listed properties. However, in the Lafayette Park district, the county courthouse is a contributing property.Brook and Spencer-Ralph, 8. At that time it was used for all county governmental functions, but since then most non- judicial departments have moved to a 1920s 13-story office building on State Street. that contributes to the downtown historic district.Harwood and O'Brien, 24. The building has been renumbered to 112 State Street since the listing. A prominent state government office, the Alfred E. Smith Building, also contributes to the Center Square/Hudson‚ÄìPark Historic District. Some former police and fire buildings are contributing properties to that and other districts.Elsewhere in Center Square is the city's former police and fire signaling station, and a former firehouse also contributes. A former police station is among the contributing properties to the Clinton Avenue Historic District, and likewise the South End has another former firehouse. Four of the properties listed have, or have had, a military purpose. The original Fort Orange, built by the Dutch colonial authorities of New Netherland, defended the fledgling settlement. In the late 19th century, the state built the two armories for the National Guard. The Slater was commissioned by the Navy for service in the Pacific theater of World War II; it was later sold to the Greek Navy, where it was rechristened the Aetos. =Education, arts and sciences= Government entities also control the four buildings used for educational purposes. Three are used for administrative purposes‚Äîthe Old Albany Academy Building, originally a private school, is the City School District of Albany's main offices, the former headquarters of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad is now the main administration building for the State University of New York (SUNY) system and the State Department of Education Building is home to that agency, which oversees public education in the state. The James Hall Office building has been annexed to one of the city's elementary schools, later used for a Montessori school. The former Philip Livingston Magnet Academy, now converted into senior apartments, is the only purpose-built public school building listed so far in Albany. Two former public school buildings are included as contributing properties in the South End district,Botch, Breyer and Sweet, 6. and the former St. Joseph's Academy is a contributing property to Arbor Hill. The Harmanus Bleecker Library, originally built by the city as its first library but now redeveloped privately as office space, is one of eight properties with a past or present cultural function. Of the other seven only two, the Albany Institute of History & Art and the Palace Theatre, are purpose-built for their continuing role. The Institute, the city's major museum, is joined by three historic house museums and the Slater in that function. Lastly, the Washington Avenue Armory is now used for some concerts. Contributing properties to the historic districts with cultural functions include the John A. Howe Branch library in the South End. Three properties also commemorate scientific discoveries and technological accomplishments. As a professor at the Albany Academy, Joseph Henry discovered electrical inductance, which would later lead to the development of the telegraph and all subsequent information technology. The building has since been renamed in his memory. James Hall made many of his paleontological and geological breakthroughs from the research in his office and laboratory. While Squire Whipple was an Albany resident whose bowstring truss bridge design was based on his own mathematical studies of the stresses on bridge trusses, work which helped move bridge building from a craft to a science, he did not have anything to do with the construction of the bridge that shares his name. It is believed to be the work of one of many bridge builder copying his design, which was portable and easy to assemble. Albany's bridge is one of only two in that design still in use in New York, one of the oldest surviving iron bridges in the country and one of the few of those that use both cast and wrought iron. Religion and institutional All 10 of the listed buildings used for religious purposes are or were Christian churches. Two are CatholicCathedral of the Immaculate Conception and St. Mary's Church and six are used by various Protestant denominations (the Episcopal Church accounts for three).Calvary Methodist Episcopal Church, Cathedral of All Saints, First Reformed Church, St. Andrew's Episcopal Church and St. Peter's Episcopal Church. Church of the Holy Innocents, which is vacant, was built for an Episcopal congregation and later used for Russian Orthodox worship. Three of the listed churches‚Äîthe First Reformed Church St. Peter's Episcopal Church and St. Mary's Church‚Äîare home to Albany's oldest congregations in their denominations. The First Reformed Church, dating to 1634, is also the city's oldest church building and the oldest Christian congregation in upstate New York. St. Mary's, established near the end of the 18th century, is likewise the oldest Catholic congregation in the city and upstate. All Saints and Immaculate Conception are, respectively, the cathedrals of the Episcopal and Catholic dioceses of Albany. Immaculate Conception is further distinguished as the second-oldest Catholic cathedral in the state after St. Patrick's in New York City. In the historic districts, fourteen churches are contributing properties. They include some prominent local churches, like St. Joseph's, the city's third Catholic church, in the Ten Broeck Triangle section of the Arbor Hill district. Others are historically important, like Mt. Calvary Baptist Church in the South End, the only remaining wood frame church in the city. The one purpose-built synagogue among the contributing properties, Wilborn Temple in Center Square, has since been converted into a church.Gilder, 135. Only one property is used for non-profit institutional use outside of a religious organization. Nut Grove, a former mansion on the south boundary of the city, is now part of a substance-abuse rehabilitation facility, following its use as a hospice. The Schuyler Mansion, another former center of a large estate, was used as an orphanage between the family's occupancy and its acquisition by the state. =Residential= All of the nine present or former residential properties listed are purpose-built single-family houses. Of them, only the governor's mansion is still used that way. Four of the others have been converted into office space or other commercial useThe Benjamin Walworth Arnold House and Carriage House, Walter Merchant House, Quackenbush House and Van Ostrande‚ÄìRadliff House and three old mansions‚ÄîCherry Hill and the Schuyler and Ten Broeck mansions‚Äîhave been converted into historic house museums. The Stephen and Harriet Myers Residence, a former stop on the Underground Railroad, is vacant but being converted into one. Nut Grove, as noted above, is now part of a substance-abuse treatment center. By contrast, the historic districts are overwhelmingly residential. The smallest ones‚ÄîJermain Street, Knox Street and Rapp Road‚Äîare composed entirely of houses. Four rowhouses, possibly to become office space,, J.L. Metzger and Associates, retrieved October 16, 2013. make up the Broadway Row. Among the larger districts closer to the city's core only downtown is primarily commercial or mixed-use, although a few older houses remain. The Lafayette Park district is mostly large government buildings, but has a residential block at one corner. Most of the contributing residential properties, like the individually listed ones, were built as single-family homes. Most that are multiple-unit dwellings are those homes that have been subdivided into duplexes; however there are some apartment houses in Arbor Hill,Gilder, Arbor Hill 13. Center SquareThe Fort Frederick Apartments, described at Gilder, Albany Architecture, 126. and the South End.Botch, Breyer and Sweet, 67. The latter two also have former industrial buildings that have been converted into apartments.In Center Square, the Knickerbocker Apartments, described at Gilder, Albany Architecture, 140.In the South End, the Jared Holt Wax Works, described at Botch, Breyer and Sweet, 20. =Commercial= Eleven of the listed buildings have either been built or adapted for commercial purposes. The former group accounts for six buildings. All but one remains in commercial use‚Äîthe former headquarters of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, now in government and educational reuse as the system administration building for the State University of New York. Commercially repurposed buildings were primarily houses, with four of those listed as such now serving as office space. One former government building, the city's Quackenbush Pumping Station, is now the Albany Pump Station brewpub. Among the contributing properties to the downtown historic district are five of the listed commercial buildings, three purpose- built and two adapted, as well as the SUNY system administration building. Of the other six, only the Arnold House contributes to another historic district, Washington Park. Downtown's contributing properties also include other significant commercial buildings in the city's history such as the Home Savings Bank Building,Harwood and O'Brien, 30 Albany's tallest building at the time of its 1927 construction. Some of Center Square's rowhouses have also been converted into offices. Lark Street, with many shops, runs through the district as well. Another significant commercial corridor, South Pearl Street, runs through the South EndBotch, Breyer and Sweet, 5 and then the Mansion before reaching downtown.Larson, Mansion, 41. Green Street in the Pastures district also has a small row with commercial storefronts. =Transportation and infrastructure= Two listings‚Äîthe former Union Station building and the Whipple Cast and Wrought Iron Bowstring Truss Bridge‚Äîserved transportation purposes for most of their existence. The former was converted to office space after passenger train service stopped in 1968. The latter, once used as a road bridge into a farm on the city's outskirts, is now used only by pedestrians due to its age since the farm became a public park. Outside of transportation purposes, there is one other building that was part of the city's infrastructure. The Albany Pump Station was formerly the Quackenbush Pumping Station of the city's water system. When the city switched from using the nearby Hudson River to Alcove Reservoir as its primary water source in 1937, it was taken out of service. After several decades of neglect it has been revived as a brewpub. There are two significant transportation-related resources among the contributing properties to the historic districts. Most prominent is the former railroad bridge in the Broadway‚ÄìLivingston Avenue Historic District, a Warren truss dating to 1900. In Center Square there is also one of the two surviving overhead wire poles from the city's trolley system. =Open space= Four parks in the city are included in its listings. Lincoln Park is listed individually, and Swinburne Park is listed along with neighboring Bleecker Stadium. Lafayette and Washington parks are contributing properties to the historic districts that bear their names. Architects and architecture Most of the listed properties date from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, the period of the city's greatest prosperity and growth. As such the architectural styles most prevalent are from that era. From outside there are more from older periods than newer. Despite the city's founding by the Dutch, only one listed property, the Van Ostrande‚ÄìRadliff House, the city's oldest building, is a genuine example of Dutch Colonial architecture. Even then its Dutch features that do survive are more structural and internal, most notably its jambless fireplace, the only one in that style remaining in the country. English colonial styles are more visibly represented by the Georgian Schuyler Mansion. The Ten Broeck Mansion, built near the end of the 18th century, is the earliest listing postdating American independence. Like Schuyler's a gabled brick estate house, its early use of the similarly classically-inspired Federal style shows the transition from colonial architecture to the modes of the new nation and century. Philip Hooker's First Reformed Church, another Federal structure completed shortly after Ten Broeck's mansion, was his first major building. With the Old Albany Academy Building in 1815 Hooker would further develop the Federal style in the city. The style persisted in vernacular forms as late as 1838, when the brick house of strawberry-farming pioneer James Wilson, the oldest contributing property to the Knox Street Historic District, was built.Opalka, Knox Street, 5. Following the opening of the Erie Canal in the 1820s, a new generation of builders continued the evolution of the classically inspired form into the Greek Revival, which made its mark in the city shortly before mid-century. The houses of the Broadway Row show this transition from the Federal style. It would be used for both the upscale townhouses of Elk Street, one of Albany's most distinguished addresses for decades afterwards,Gilder and Waite, Albany Architecture, 75‚Äì78. and the restrained frame houses of Foley's Row in the South End, speculative housing built for lower-income buyers.Botch, Breyer and Sweet 114. The style was often used for public buildings, and in Albany it made its grand entrance with 1842's colonnaded State Hall (now the Court of Appeals Building), its rotunda using all three classical orders. South of the city limits at the time of its construction, Alexander Jackson Davis's Nut Grove is his only Greek Revival house within the Hudson Valley, and a rare example of the Grecian country house within that style.Brooke, Nut Grove, 6‚Äì8. The Victorian styles that dominated architecture in the second half of the century made their debuts in Albany at its midpoint. The small building in Lincoln Park where James Hall did his groundbreaking paleontological research is an Italian villa-style variant of the Italianate style, built from a pattern designed by Andrew Jackson Downing and his student Calvert Vaux, erected in 1852, the year of the former's death. Elsewhere in the city, the Italianate style proved ideal for the many rowhouses going up, particularly along Clinton Avenue, where different stretches show the transition from the Greek Revival and how it was applied before and after the Civil War.. A partial version of this document can be found at livingplaces.com The Walter Merchant House on Washington Avenue, one of the more developed applications of the Italianate rowhouse in Albany, is one of the rare detached, larger ones remaining. As they had elsewhere, churches were instrumental in bringing the Gothic Revival to Albany. The city's Episcopalians were the first, with Frank Wills' Church of the Holy Innocents in 1850. Two years later Patrick Keely built the Gothic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception for the newly established Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany. Lutherans in the South End put up the German Evangelical Protestant Church, still a focal point of that neighborhood, in 1857.Botch, Breyer and Sweet, 42. At the end of the decade the Episcopal Church brought in Gothic Revival pioneer Richard Upjohn, along with his son, to design the new St. Peter's Episcopal Church building in the French Gothic mode.. The complicated construction of the state capitol wound up embracing the century's later architectural movements. In 1867, Thomas Fuller began the new building in the Second Empire style. Nine years and three stories later, however, amid mounting criticism of his work and the costs of the project, he was replaced by Leopold Eidlitz and Henry Hobson Richardson, who oversaw the construction of the next two floors in the Renaissance Revival style. They lasted until 1883, when new governor Grover Cleveland replaced them with Isaac Perry, who supervised the building through its 1899 completion, moving toward a more Romanesque style as he did so. Some of the architects who worked on the capitol graced Albany with other projects. After an 1880 fire destroyed city hall, Richardson designed its replacement, completed in 1883, a period when he is generally regarded as having been at his creative peak.Waite, Albany Architecture, 70‚Äì71 Perry built the Washington Avenue Armory for the state seven years later. The Renaissance Revival style used for the capitol's later floors was complemented when that style was used for another project with a complicated history, the city's 1883 post office.Waite, Albany Architecture, 92‚Äì93 The more decorative styles of the fin de si√®cle began to appear in Albany during the 1890s. Richard Morris Hunt built the Rice Mansion, the only freestanding Beaux Arts mansion in the city, now part of the Albany Institute of History & Art, during that time. In the last years of the century, the new Union Station by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge brought the style to where most visitors entered the city. In the first decades of the new century, another new style, Colonial Revival, came to the city. Stanford White's Benjamin Walworth Arnold House, his only building in the city, was also the first to use it, in 1905. A decade later, the First Congregational Church of Albany 1917 Woodlawn building by Albert W. Fuller attracted considerable media attention as the first Colonial Revival church in the city. It would receive its highest application in the city 15 years later with the opening of Philip Livingston Junior High School at the city's northern entrance, one of its few landmark buildings outside downtown. Historical context Early expansion, fueled by the 1825 completion of the Erie Canal and the immigrant populations it attracted, largely went to the north and south of the original settlement, absorbing large earlier estates in the latter direction such as the Schuyler Mansion,Greiff, Constance M.; , National Park Service; July 26, 1985, retrieved September 2, 2011. Cherry Hill and Nut Grove leading to the development of the Arbor Hill, Mansion, PasturesMesick, 9 and South End historic districts. West of that historic core, the first city hall and state capitol buildings around what later became Lafayette Park spurred some development around them early in the 19th century. Near the end of the century, the completion of the current capitol and Washington Park gave a new impetus to the city's growth in that direction, opening up the Center Square neighborhood.Brown and Spencer-Ralph, 11 By the 1920s streetcar lines were running out to newer, more suburban neighborhoods to the west and southwest. Two of the listed churches helped pioneer the development of the Pine Hills neighborhood; the city built Hook and Ladder No. 4, the only fire station listed, to serve another new enclave. After World War II, another suburban building boom and new technologies combined to create the Lustron Houses of Jermain Street Historic District, the most recently constructed of the city's Register listings.

Operations 1986-87 Formed in April 1986 at West Beirut and funded by Libya, this little-known faction of about 50-100 fighters is suspected to be merely a cover for the National Revolutionary Command (Omar al-Mukhtar) or NRC-OM (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÇŸäÿßÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ´Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜŸäÿ© (ÿπŸÖÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿÆÿ™ÿßÿ±)  Al-Qiadat al-Thawriyat al-Wataniyya (Omar al-Makhtar)), an equally obscure Lebanon-based group also backed by Libya that perpetrated several armed actions against western interests in Lebanon and neighbouring Cyprus. The first action attributed to the UNO took place on 3 August 1986, when a small 'commando' team armed with small-arms, RPG-7s and light mortars attacked a group of British airmen on leave with their families in a beach near the Royal Air Force Akrotiri airbase, Cyprus, wounding two women. Later in August 1987 another party of UNO fighters ambushed a military vehicle on a Cipriote road, seriously wounding a British soldier and a civilian companion with light machine-gun fire. Decline and demise The UNO/NRC has not claimed responsibility for any attacks since 1987, though it is likely that they remained active till the end of the civilian strife in Lebanon. The group is presumed to have been quietly de-activated due to Libyan pressure in the early 1990s and it is no longer operational.

The temple is known for being a Bhikkhuni (Buddhist nun) refuge and is affiliated with the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. Origin Originally built in the 7th century by Buddhist Monk Wonhyo, Geumtapsa dates back to the Three Kingdoms period (57BC - AD668) when it was established as a branch of Songgwangsa (Temple). Treasures =Tangible Cultural Property #102 (Goheung-gun)= Geungnakjeon (Hall), Tangible Cultural Property #102 (Goheung-gun). Geungnakjeon Hall of Geumtapsa Temple (Geumtapsageungnakjeon) is constructed in the style of the later years of the Joseon era (1392-1910). It is said to have been burned down in 1597 during Imjin wars and to have been reconstructed in 1604. Records show that the building was either repaired or rebuilt in 1846, the 12th year of the reign of Joseon's King Heonjong (1849-63). Geungnakjeon has a hipped-and-gabled roof with the eaves of the roof being supported by clusters of brackets. The multi-bracketing is typical of late-Joseon architecture. Geungnakjeon has a Sanshin painting, the \\"Assembly of Spirits\\" where Sanshin (the Mountain Spirit), is depicted wearing a \\"flying scarf\\" like an immortal angel and holding a Daoist \\"peach of immortality\\", both of which are extremely rare (usually only features of his attendants). Temple halls dedicated to Amitabha Buddha are usually named Geungnakjeon or Paradise Hall. =Natural Monument #239= Geumtapsa at the foot of Cheondeungsan. The green surrounding the temple is the forest of Nutmeg Yew trees making up Natural Monument #239. One of the more prominent features at Geumtapsa is the Forest of Nutmeg Yew (torreya nucifera) that surrounds the temple. Nutmeg trees are only found in the southern part of Korea. Average height of trees found in the forest is 10m/33 ft but can grow to about 25m/82 ft in height. Its needle-like leaves are thick, small, and sharp at the point. These trees bloom in spring and bear long and round seeds in fall. A good source of lumber, the trees have gradually disappeared and now only a few groves in Jeju-do, and some areas of the Jeollabuk-do and Jeollanam-do (provinces), which have been designated Natural Monuments, remain. This forest of nutmeg trees at Geumtapsa Temple is at the mid-slope level of Mt. Cheondeungsan and is said to have been planted in 637, the sixth year of Queen Seondeok ( 632-647) of the Silla Kingdom (57B.C.-A.D.935). The forest of nutmeg trees at Geumtapsa Temple in Goheung is designated and conserved as a Natural Monument because of its great value to scientific research. =Treasure #1344= Buddhist painting of Geumtapsa Temple (Geumtapsagwaebultaeng) is a painting, or gwaebul, from the King Jeongjo period of the Joseon Era depicting a unique composition with the three Buddhas of the past, present and future, flanked by major bosals depicted on a wide canvas. Buddhas in Geungnakjeon (Hall) - (not the gwaebul). Gwaebul refers to a large Buddhist painting that is hung outside the temple hall for outdoor sermons during Buddhist ceremonies or services. The painting is enshrined in Geumtapsa Temple, and is 506 cm/16.6 ft in length and 648 cm/21.3 ft in width. The composition of the painting is rather simple as only the major bosals are depicted, without guardians such as Sacheonwang (Four Guardian Kings). The painting is divided horizontally into three parts where each of the three Buddhas of the past, present and future are drawn on a large scale. The attendants are depicted at the top and bottom of the painting. The main Buddha is depicted with a genial face and small features. The yukgye (protuberance on top of Buddha‚Äôs head) is clearly shown in the shape of a sangtu (topknot) spread out to the side, and there is a large-sized gyeju (jeweled hair ornament) placed on top of the hair. The Buddha is depicted with broad, square shoulders and chigyeon (flower-shape decoration) around his right ankle. The gwaebulgwe (storage box), in which the painting is stored, was made in 1697, around 100 years before the painting. The painting is a collaborative work of Bihyeon and Kwaeyun in the 2nd year of King Jeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty (1778). It is an invaluable piece showing the characteristics of the paintings drawn in the late 18th century, such as the Buddha with small features and broad, square shoulders, a yukgye that is spread out to the side, a large- sized gyeju on top of the hair and a chigyeon around the ankle.

Cooper married Maria Jer√≥nima de la Encarnaci√≥n Vallejo, the daughter of Ignacio Vicente Ferrer Vallejo, on August 24, 1827, at San Carlos Mission.  Monterey  Upon his arrival in Monterey, Cooper made arrangements to sell the Rover to the government of newly independent Mexico, which as yet had no ships on the Pacific Coast with which to maintain contact with Alta California. To help cash-poor California governor Luis Arguello pay him for the ship, Cooper agreed to stay on as captain and enter the lucrative China trade, twice carrying Californian and Hawaiian goods to Canton and returning with Chinese manufactured goods. Cooper and Arguello quarreled, however, over how to split the profits, and it was many years before Cooper received the payment due. Collection was made more difficult when Arguello was replaced as governor in 1825. In 1826, the Rover was sent south under a new captain, and never returned to Monterey. Moving on from maritime occupations, Cooper drew on his knowledge of trade to open a general merchandise store in Monterey. He boarded with the family of hl Ignacio Vicente Ferrer Vallejo. General Vallejo, a prominent family of Castillean descent. One of their children was General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. In 1827 Cooper proposed to Vallejo's daughter Maria Jer√≥nima de la Encarnaci√≥n Vallejo. To marry her, Cooper was baptized as a Roman Catholic and adopted the baptismal name of Juan Bautista Rogers Cooper. His padrino (sponsor) was William Edward Petty Hartnell, a native Englishman who had been residing in Monterey as a trader since 1822. The couple married in 1827. After passage of an 1829 law requiring permanent residents to be Mexican citizens, both Cooper and Hartnell were naturalized in 1830. Before 1829, naturalization was not strictly required but, along with conversion to Catholicism and marriage into a prominent family, helped Cooper become accepted in Monterey and obtain land grants. Cooper worked tirelessly along with his half-brother Thomas Larkin to help California join the union. Cooper later returned to the seafaring life but, having acquired land, he gradually quit the sea. From 1839 to 1844 he made many trips to the Mexican coast and to the Hawaiian Islands, in command of the government-owned Californian, which carried mail, prisoners, and government officials from Monterey to Mexico. In 1846 he made a voyage to Peru, and in 1849 he went as master of the Eveline to China.John Woolfendon and Amelie Elkinton, 1983, Cooper: Juan Bautista Rogers Cooper, Boxwood Press.  Assistance to Jedediah Smith  Because Monterey was the territorial capital and port of entry, anyone entering Alta California had to come to Monterey to get official permission to remain. In 1827, Cooper hosted and escorted trapper/explorer Jedediah Smith, the first U.S. citizen to travel to California overland. Cooper helped Smith obtain a passport so his party could continue north into Oregon.Woolfenden, pp 35‚Äì38  Land grants  In 1829 Cooper bought of Rancho Bolsa del Potrero y Moro Cojo (Pocket of the Pasture and the Lame Moor and La Sagrada Familia or The Holy Family) from Joaqu√≠n de la Torre for $2,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars), to whom it had originally been granted. The rancho was located between the Salinas River and the Tembladero Slough, near present-day Castroville in the Salinas Valley. Although Cooper did not receive legal possession until 1840, he was involved in managing the ranch as early as 1834, when he contracted with Job Dye to raise mules on the property. Governor Jos√© Figueroa granted John B.R. Cooper Rancho El Molino (about ) in present-day Sonoma County, California in 1833, which was confirmed by Governor Nicol√°s Guti√©rrez in 1836.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco Juan Bautista Alvarado received a grant to Rancho El Sur (about two leagues of land, or roughly in 1834 from Governor Jose Figueroa. In 1840, Alvarado and Cooper traded ownership, with Alvarado gaining Rancho El Sur and Cooper the more accessible and readily farmed Rancho Bolsa del Potrero y Moro Cojo. Alvarado was a nephew of Encarnacion Vallejo Cooper. Also in 1840, Governor Alvarado granted Cooper Rancho Punta de Quentin, which later became the site of San Quentin State Prison. Cooper built a mansion on the point. Cooper and Pablo de la Guerra were granted Rancho Nicasio by Governor Manuel Micheltorena in 1844. Cooper sold his interests in both Marin County ranchos in 1850.  Final years  John Cooper in 1870. From 1850, Captain Cooper lived with his family in Monterey, and was appointed in 1851 to the post of Monterey Harbormaster. In 1864 he and his wife moved to San Francisco, where they built a home located at 821 Bush St. Cooper died in 1872. Their daughter Ana Maria de Guadalupe, married Herman Wohler, a German who had come to California in 1848, and Amelia, married Eusebio Joseph Molera in 1875. Cooper's wife Martha Cooper Hughes died on May 23, 1940 in Monterey, California. Funeral services were held the Royal Presidio Chapel in Monterey at San Carlos Church. After her first husband J. B.

In contrast to Hauptmann's naturalistic dramas, The Assumption of Hannele adopts a more symbolist dramaturgy and includes a dream sequence.B√©d√© and Edgerton (1980, 349), Brockett and Hildy (2003, 396), and Hartnoll (1983, 377). The play is the first in recorded world literature with a child as its heroine.B√©d√© and Edgerton (1980, 349). The play tells the story of a neglected and abused peasant child, who, on her deathbed, experiences a vision of divine powers welcoming her into the afterlife. It was first published in 1894. Hauptmann was awarded the Grillparzer Prize in 1896 for the play. Production history The play received its premi√®re under the title Hannele at the K√∂nigliches Schauspielhaus in Berlin, opening on 14 December 1893. The production was directed by Max Grube, with music by Max Marschalk. The cast included Adalbert Matkowsky. The play was directed by the seminal Russian theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski with his Society of Art and Literature in Moscow, in a production that opened on .Benedetti (1999, 385) and Worrall (1996, 30). At the request of Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, who considered Hauptmann to be a playwright superior to Henrik Ibsen, the play was to be included in the repertoire of the first season of their world-famous Moscow Art Theatre.Benedetti (1999, 65, 67) and Worrall (1996, 30). At the play's first read-though, it reduced the entire company, with the exception of Vsevolod Meyerhold (who had been cast as the Angel of Death), to tears.Benedetti (1999, 72) and Worrall (1996, 30). On , however, the production was banned, following protests made by the Russian Orthodox Church, despite having been passed by the censor.Benedetti (1999, 84) and Worrall (1996, 30, 56). Productions in the United States include one in New York at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, which opened on 1 May 1894, a second at the Lyceum Theatre, which opened on 11 April 1910 and which featured Minnie Fiske, and a third at the Cort Theatre, which opened on 15 February 1924, and included both Eva LeGallienne and Basil Rathbone in the cast.Hartnoll (1893, 377), , and . British productions include one in Liverpool in 1913 in which both Gertrude Lawrence and No√´l Coward were involved and another in London in 1924.Day (2007, 34), Hartnoll (1983, 377), and Morley (1981, 9‚Äì12). Adaptations In 1922 the Danish film director Urban Gad directed a cinematic adaptation of the play with German titles.. Thea von Harbou adapted the play for another German cinematic version, also titled Hanneles Himmelfahrt, which she directed in 1934.. The play also formed the basis for Paul Graener and George Graener's opera Hanneles Himmelfahrt, which was first performed on 17 February 1927. An opera titled Hannele was also written by Italian composer Antonio Guarnieri and recorded by RAI in 1971. References Sources * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre.

Waugoshance Point (GNIS ID#) is a cape or peninsula that juts into Lake Michigan from the northwest coast of the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan in Emmet County. It separates the Straits of Mackinac to its north from Sturgeon Bay to the south and is part of Wilderness State Park. The nearest town is Mackinaw City. Waugoshance is a hybrid word, that combines the Anishinaabemowin word wah'goosh (English:fox) and the French word anse (English:cove). Waugosance Point sandy beach, with reef lighthouse on horizon. Geography The subaerial ridges along the cape rise approximately above lake level (an elevation of about above sea level.) Beyond the tip of Waugoshance Point are Temperance Island and Waugoshance (previously, Crane) Island. The point and the islands consist of both sandy and rock and gravel beaches. These are an ideal habitat for gulls and wading shore birds, including the endangered piping plover. Dominant trees include balsam fir, white spruce, white cedar, white pine, paper birch and trembling aspen. Mosses and lichens are abundant in its wetland ecosystem. Perch and small mouth bass are abundant off-shore. The point and its neighboring islands are bedrock outcrops of an extensive reef that reaches more than WNW from the inner end of the point, with water depths of only at the outer end. This reef, along with others in the vicinity are exceptionally dangerous hazards for sailing vessels and small craft along the northeastern rim of Lake Michigan. Three nearby lighthouses warn mariners away from the danger that lurks just below the surface and mark the western approach to the Straits of Mackinac: *White Shoal Light () *Grays Reef Light () *Waugoshance Light () History Jean Nicolet was probably the first European explorer to pass through the Mackinac Straits area as he journeyed westward in the late summer of 1634. At that time, the region's primary inhabitants were the Odawa and Ojibwe people, who called the region Michilimackinac. They, along with the Potawatomi were part of a long- term tribal alliance called the Council of Three Fires (Anishinaabe: Niswi- mishkodewin), which was formed at the end of the eighth Century at Michilimackinac. French voyageurs and coureurs des bois explored and settled in this part of Michigan in the second half of the 17th century. Father Jacques Marquette established a Christian mission at Saint Ignace in 1671. These newcomers were well received by the Indian populations in the area, with relatively few difficulties or hostilities. Alexander Henry, a fur trader, was the first Englishman to venture into this area after its cession by France to Great Britain, arriving at Fort Michilimackinac in 1761, after the French garrison had abandoned the post, and before the British sent to occupy it had arrived. He found the Indians to be incensed at having been surrendered to British domination and bitterly hostile toward him and anyone not French. Henry was present two years later when, on June 2, 1763, Ojibwe and Sauk Indians attacked and took over the fort, as part of the wider movement known as Pontiac's Rebellion. Most of the fort's British inhabitants were killed. Henry was one of the few whose life was spared. The earliest known written reference to Waugoshance Point is found in Henry's journal in his recounting of the massacre and his ordeal afterward. Much of the old growth forest on and around Waugoshance was heavily logged during the second half of the 19th century. The white and red pines that made up much of the forest was in high demand nationwide for the building of individual homes and whole cities, along with furniture and other items, such as railroad ties. During World War II the cape, along with the islands off the point and the abandoned lighthouse were designated as the Waugoshance Point Target and used for tactical bombing and strafing practice as well as for experimentation with radio controlled (drone) aircraft. Planes were flown out of the Naval Air Station at Traverse City (now Cherry Capital Airport). Evidence of this military usage can still be found in the area. Shell fragments and motor parts are occasionally uncovered. The fuselage of a target plane can be seen from the point parking lot. Since 1951, this area has been a nature wilderness reserve and study area.

It is named for Stanford University. It is the fifteenth tallest mountain in California and is located about from University Peak which was named for the University of California.  History  On August 1, 1896 Professor Bolton Coit Brown of Stanford made the first recorded ascent and requested that it be named Mount Stanford. Since there was another peak with the same name in Placer County, he suggested the peak he climbed be named Stanford University peak if his first choice was rejected. The decision was made to give the name Castle Peak to the summit in Placer County and Brown's first choice was accepted. Three years later, on August 16, 1899, Stanford University's President, David Starr Jordan, also make the ascent with his wife and a party from Stanford. He had previously climbed in the Alps. In 1911, the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) named a peak in honor of the Leland Stanford, an American tycoon, politician and founder of Stanford University. The name originally given this summit was Stanford Peak but in 1982 the USGS changed its name to Mount Stanford. This other peak, with an elevation of , is located to the north-northeast overlooking Pioneer Basin in the John Muir Wilderness.  Getting There  Mount Stanford is described as an exposed scramble ().

The railway station is situated in the city centre on the former fortification wall circuit, within walking distance of the most important city buildings. It is one of the oldest railway stations in the Czech Republic, having been in operation since 1839. History The first building of Brno railway station since September 1838 =First railway station= Brno main railway station was built in 1838, one of the first railway stations in the world. It was the terminus on the line from Vienna to Brno, one of the branches of Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway. On 16 November 1838 it was put into operation for trials and exhibitions, and on 7 July 1839 it became fully commercially operational. It was initially designed as a terminal station by Austrian architect Anton J√ºngling. =Second railway station= The railway station became a through station after construction of the rival Northern Railway (Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways) in 1849. As soon as the traffic at the railway station, which was occupied by two competing companies, started to grow, some space limitation caused by bevelled shape between two segments of a polygonal principle Brno Ringstrasse. =Third railway station= At the turn of the 19th to 20th centuries the side wings of individual companies were connected with a single Concourse (entrance hall), which served to both of them. The author of this partially Art Nouveau building was architect Josef Oehm. The hall has an outline of 18x25 metres. The oldest transverse subway leads in its axis under the platform 4. The hall construction was finished in 1904. Railway station was partially and surfacing (visual only) modernized in 1947 by architect Bohuslav Fuchs, the last time in 1988. Description of the railway station The Railjet train Bed≈ôich Smetana to Prague and RegioPanter at 2. platform The Railjet connection to Vienna The ticket office in main hall Brno railway station is combined. It has 4 through platforms with 6 lines and 2 terminal platforms. In total 6 platforms. Through platforms are 415 and 310 metres long and in ground plan are curved into the letter S. Terminal platforms are straight and 350 metres long. The width of platforms is 9 metres and more. Their covering is simple, historical. Routes The international corridor in the Czech Republic, with main cities marked including Brno Brno main station is an important station on the pan-international corridor passing through the country (Dƒõƒç√≠n ‚Äì Prague ‚Äì Pardubice ‚Äì Brno ‚Äì B≈ôeclav), with international trains serving the station to and from Germany, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria. It is also located on five other lines, three of which carry intercity trains: *Brno - Jihlava ‚Äì ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice ‚Äì Plze≈à *Brno - Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod ‚Äì Prague *Brno - P≈ôerov ‚Äì Olomouc/Ostrava *Brno - Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ *Brno - Hru≈°ovany nad Jevi≈°ovkou Future plans Currently Brno station is approaching at full capacity and therefore in need of expansion, however its location on the edge of the historic center of the city prevents that. Capacity problems are just in one part of the railway station, on the southern station head (switch system), where is a regional transport. The question of how to cope with the substance of railway station has been being discussed for several decades. The idea of moving railway station to the new location, 550 metres southern, emerged already in the 1920s. It was after a sudden increase of transport capacity between 1923 and 1924 (26% more). Such an increase has never happened again. Experts who worked for Brno before World War II abandoned this idea. Later on this idea reappeared several times in the new contexts. In 1970 railway station was relieved from freight transport which was transferred to the modernized track on the South. Since then the railway station has been intended purely for passenger transportation. The city council have made plans to build a new station in a remote location ‚Äì 960 metres southeast from the city where personal and cargo transport would be reunited again. This possibility is confronted with a continuous opposition of experts and public. Already in 2004 this situation invoked a citizens- initiated referendum. However, this referendum did not become binding for city because of the insufficient turnout (25%). Legislation required 50% turnout at that time. The overwhelming majority of 85% of voters was for keeping railway station on the current place. Nowadays citizens have initiated a new referendum, which will be held simultaneously with regional and senate electionPresidential decision (Milo≈° Zeman) on Regional election term. on the 7 and 8 October 2016. According to the current legislation only 35% turnout is sufficient for legally binding outcome of the referendum.

It was published in his 1796 collection of poems. The subject, Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope, had originally shared political views with Coleridge, but as time passed, Coleridge's views gradually shifted. By 1803, Coleridge was claiming that he did not want the poem published anymore and that it was originally intended to mock those who held the beliefs which Coleridge had held years earlier. It is part of the Sonnets on Eminent Characters series, although it was not published in the Morning Chronicle unlike the others in the series. There is, however, a possible predecessor sonnet to the 1796 version that some editors have attributed to Coleridge. Background Coleridge had an 11-sonnet series in the Morning Chronicle titled Sonnets on Eminent Characters, which ran between 1 December 1794 and 29 January 1795. Early on, Coleridge told Robert Southey, in an 11 December 1794 letter, that 10 of the sonnets were completed and 6 were planned. After the 11th was written, the series was stopped. In a 10 March 1795 letter to George Dyer, Coleridge stated that he planned five more poems, with only one addressed to Lord Stanhope being written. The first appearance of the poem was in Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems and not in the Morning Chronicle like the original series.Mays 2001 pp. 155, 191 During the early 1790s, Coleridge held many radical political beliefs, including a system of government called Pantisocracy. However, after plans for a Pantisocratic community fell apart, Coleridge's opinions radically shifted to something similar to what was being promoted by Stanhope.Taussig 2002 p. 151 Unlike his brother-in-law the Prime Minister William Pitt, Stanhope supported the French Revolution, which earned him praise. Previously, Coleridge had attacked Pitt's views as being against liberty. However, by the time Coleridge would have had the poem printed for his 1796 collection of poems, he changed his mind on Stanhope and the poem was not to be reprinted in later collections. However, it still was printed in the 1803 collection.Mays 2001 pp. 160, 191 In a note to Sara Hutchingson's copy of the 1803 edition of Coleridge's poetry, Coleridge stated, \\"Infamous Insertion! It was written in ridicule of Jacobinical [bombast], put into the first Edition by a blunder of Cottle's, rejected indignantly from the second‚Äî& here maliciously reprinted in my Absence.\\"Mays 2001 qtd p. 191 Another poem, To Lord Stanhope on Reading his Late Protest in the House of Lords, written under the name \\"One of the People\\" and printed in the 31 January 1795 Morning Chronicle, was also attributed to Coleridge. The attribution of the poem to Coleridge has been argued as the precursor to the 1796 edition of the poem while other editors have disputed it and authorship is uncertain. Another sonnet, \\"Written on Contemplating a Very Fine Setting Sun. To Lord Stanhope\\" was printed in the 21 February 1795 Cambridge Intelligencer. Although it has been argued as possibly being Coleridge's, it too cannot be definitively attributed as his.Mays 2001 I.II pp. 263‚Äì264 Poem The 1796 edition of the poem reads:Mays 2001 p. 191 The poem published on 31 January and attributed to Coleridge reads: Themes The Sonnets on Eminent Characters contained many poems dedicated to those whom Coleridge considered his heroes, along with two whom he did not favour.Ashton 1997 p. 61 Coleridge claimed that the poem was supposed to be taken ironically, but there is little evidence that he originally wanted it removed from his collections. Instead, his feelings on the poem are possibly only a retrospective reaction to the poem's content. If the 31 January sonnet is Coleridge's, then it would represent Coleridge's feelings at the time about (as Gurion Taussig describes) Stanhope's \\"arguments in the tones of sensibility and its appeal to man's innate natural rights. As such, the 'friend of Humankind' represents a sentimental figure, free from artificial social prejudices or desires like 'AMBITION' that would limit his instinctive affections.\\" This idea appears in the 1796 edition of the poem with an emphasis on friend of the human race being a general love for mankind. Coleridge ranks the person who is friend of mankind above those who are merely patriots, as the friend is a truly democratic individual. This view continued in a March 1796 The Watchman essay by Coleridge which read:Taussig 2002 pp. 151‚Äì152 \\"Earl Stanhope does not talk only: he feels, and acts in contempt of aristocratic prejudices. Mr. Taylor, the son of an Apothecary at Seven Oaks, in Kent, had gained the affections of his daughter. The young Lady, truly noble from the advantages of her education, did not disguise the state of her feelings, but made her father her confidant. 'Is he not honest and intelligent?' replied the Earl.-'Assuredly, I approve of your choice.'\\"Taussig 2002 qtd. p. 152 Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary. The Life of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

It was co-written by frequent Meadows collaborator Paul Fraser. Plot In a typical English working-class town, the juveniles have nothing more to do than hang around in gangs. One day, Alan Darcy (Bob Hoskins), a highly motivated man with the same kind of youth experience, starts trying to get the young people off the street and into doing something they can believe in; boxing. Soon, he opens a training facility which is accepted gratefully by them and the gangs start to grow together into friends. Darcy manages to organise a public fight for them to prove what they have learned. A training camp with hiking tours into the mountains of Wales forge the group into a tightly-knit club society. With the day of the fight drawing closer, the young boxers get more and more excited.

It is located in Deschutes County north of Bend, Oregon, United States. The ranch buildings were constructed by Charles Boyd between 1905 and 1909. Today, the three surviving structures are the only ranch buildings that date back to the earliest period of settlement in the Bend area. The Boyd Homestead is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Charles Boyd was born in Ontario, Canada in 1863. He immigrated to Michigan with his family in the 1870s. He move to Philipsburg, Montana in 1883, where he married Anna Wyman. Boyd went into the cattle business with his brother, William, and served as mayor of Philipsburg. In 1904, Boyd moved west, settling along the Deschutes River near Bend in Central Oregon. He bought a tract of land on the east side of the river, bordering the Swalley Canal. In 1905, his family joined him, and he built a house on his property.\\"Boyd, Charles, Homestead Group\\", National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Deschutes County, Oregon, 28 June 1982. Over the next few years, Boyd expanded his ranch and built a successful cattle and meat business. Boyd eventually owned , much of it purchased under provisions of the Carey Desert Land Act of 1894. His property included pasture lands for his cattle and hay fields for winter feed. He butchered and sold meat locally, becoming the largest meat supplier in the Bend area. He had contracts to provide beef for railroad and canal construction crews and the Brooks-Scanlon Lumber Company's busy logging camps. Boyd also owed a butcher shop in downtown Bend. During the early years of the Great Depression, Boyd lost his big contracts as Bend's saw mill cut production. He died in 1933; however, members of the Boyd family continued to live in the main ranch house until 1958. In 1978, the nucleus of the historic Boyd ranch was sold to developers as the city of Bend expanded northward. In 1979, the Boyd family moved the remaining three homestead buildings to a new site approximately one quarter mile from their original location. The grouping is now located on Rivermill Avenue, approximately one quarter mile west of the Deschutes River. The new site is on a quarter-acre parcel that was part of Boyd's ranch. The new site is also adjacent to the Swalley canal where the buildings have been placed among old growth pine trees. This helps to maintain the character of the homestead. The three surviving Boyd ranch buildings possess integrity of design, craftsmanship, and materials that make them a unique grouping. In addition, they are the only surviving ranch building dating back to the earliest period of settlement in the Bend area. Because of their importance to Bend history, the Charles Boyd Homestead grouping was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 31 August 1982. Today, the Charles Boyd Homestead is a private museum.\\"Boyd, Charles, Homestead Group\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 2 August 2009.\\"Boyd, Charles, Homestead Group\\", Site Information, Oregon Historical Sites Database, State Historic Preservation Office, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 19 July 2009.  Ranch buildings  Boyd's original ranch covered and included a main house, bunk house, ice house, barn, hay shed, power house, corrals, feedlots, and a slaughterhouse as well as pastures and hay fields. However, only main house, bunk house, and ice house have survived into the 21st century. The main ranch house was built by Charles Boyd in 1905. The bunk house was constructed shortly after the main house and an ice house was added to the ranch complex in 1909. Today, these three building make up the Charles Boyd Homestead historic site just north of the Bend city limits. *The Boyd ranch house is a two-story rectangular structure measuring 26 by . The main entrance is on the south side. It is a wood-frame structure with a gable roof and brick chimney. The original batten board siding was covered by shingles in 1914. The structure was originally built on a post and sill foundation; however, it was placed on a concrete slab when it was relocated in 1979. The first floor includes a living room and a bedroom from the building's original construction plus a kitchen, a bathroom, and a side porch which were added in 1914. The interior board walls are covered with painted paper. Fir planks are used for flooring. Windows and doors are simple and have no molding. There are two bedrooms upstairs. Both rooms have tongue and groove wall paneling. In the 1930s, a front porch was added next to the kitchen. In the 1950s, the kitchen was remodeled and the main picture window in the living room enlarged. The original cooking stove, piano, and many other Boyd family furnishing remain in the house. *The bunk house is a single story rectangular building with a gable roof. It is located near the southwest corner of the main house with its entrance facing east. The bunk house measures 14 by . There are only two windows, one on the west side of the building and the other on the south side. It has shiplap exterior siding and rough pine interior walls. Windows and doors are simple with no molding. Like the main house, it was placed on a concrete slab when it was moved to its current location in 1979. *The ice house is located east of the main house. It is rectangular structure measuring by . It is equal to two stories in height and has no windows. It has a wood frame structure with shiplap exterior siding and wood shingle roof. The interior walls are rough boards with saw dust insulation. The building was originally used to store blocks of ice needed to keep meat. During the winter, Boyd cut blocks of ice from Swalley Pond and packed them in sawdust. The building's sawdust insulation preserved the blocks until they were needed in the summer. There are two sets of large double-doors on the south side of the building that were installed in the 1940s when the building was converted into a garage. It was used for that purpose until it 1978. Like the other two building, the ice house was placed on a concrete slab when it was moved to its current location in 1979.

Development and testing In 2008 China Sun developed a next generation ‚Äúgreen‚Äù power source in the form of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) that can be built into batteries that power electric cars, hybrids, scooters, and other state-of-the-art electronic devices. The first batch of lithium iron phosphate energy productions came out of China Sun Group‚Äôs production lines in April 2009. In June, China Sun Group entered into contracts with four battery production companies to begin testing samples of lithium iron phosphate. Once this testing is complete, the company plans to begin mass marketing the product domestically. The testing involves running the batteries on the natural attenuation rate curve, which measures the rate of decay over time on a curve. Early reports have indicated that customer testing indicated good consistency with little decay, which is very promising given the market potential for the products in several major Chinese provinces.

They are considered one of the forefathers of improv progressive music. The band originally operated from 1997 to 2002, but took a fifteen-year hiatus, before signing with Rhubarb Palace Music.  History  The band was started in 1997 by drummer Frank Grau (Sleepytime Gorilla Museum). The original line up consisted largely of musicians from the local space-rock group Beyond-O-Matic and other local psych-rock and jazz musicians. In 1998 the line up changed considerably, turning into a quartet featuring Mike DiPirro on bass (Free Peoples, Soulstice, Radioactive), Jai Young Kim on keyboards (Secret Chiefs 3), and guitarist Eli Good (Grassy Knoll). After the departure of DiPirro in 1999, Species Being included several new musicians to its rotating line up including bassist Kenseth Thibideau (Pinback), guitarist Mitch Cheney (Rumah Sakit), composer/keyboardist Graham Connah, and bassist Matt Lebofsky (Secret Chiefs 3, MoeTar, miRthkon). This rotation of members stuck with the band until their break up in 2002. The group reunited as a trio in 2017. The current line up consists of Matt Lebofsky, Jai young Kim and Frank Grau. Several releases through Rhubarb Palace Music are pending.http://byrnebridges.com/2017/03/rhubarb-palace-acquires-species-being- catalog/  Releases  Species Being self-released its debut Yonilicious in 1998. This album is a series of 11 vignettes strewn together to make a whimsical and wild pastiche of out-rock. Stylistically reminiscent of Soft Machine, Univers Zero, and other out-rock groups, this record was distributed in the UK by ReR Megacorp, by Marquee in Japan, and through other outlets across the U.S. and Europe. Species Being's second record, Orgone Therapy, was released in 2000 on the now defunct Innerspace Records. Much like its predecessor, it is a collage of material taken from recording sessions, this time at the Radical House studio in San Francisco. It is entirely improvised with no overdubs and instead of an out-rock style, Orgone Therapy is far more progressive rock in its approach.http://www.allmusic.com/album/orgone-therapy- mw0000094956 In 2007, former member Mitch Cheney produced a benefit CD for Children's Musical Education in St. Augustine, Florida entitled Greenness. Included on this CD is an unreleased Species Being track entitled 'Even Crappy Things Must Come To An End'. This track was taken from a live performance on WFMU 2000. Quasar: Selections from 1997-2002 is a compilation of songs from Yonilicious and Orgone Therapy and previously unreleased material. It is the debut release for Species Being on Rhubarb Palace Music and will be available June 2017. http://byrnebridges.com/2017/03/rhubarb-palace-acquires-species- being-catalog/ References * http://www.aural- innovations.com/issues/issue13/species1.html * http://www.allaboutjazz.com/reviews/r0900_104.htm&recommended;=1&recommended;=1&recommended;=1&recommended;=1 * http://gnosis2000.net/reviews/speciesbeing.htm * http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=sb-yon * https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bobmarley/albums/album/280516/orgone_therapy * http://www.e-prog.net/albums/gagliarchives2000.htm * http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/wxyc-playlists/2000/000074.html Category:Progressive rock musical groups from California Category:Psychedelic rock music groups from California ","title":"Species Being"},{"id":"23904939","text":"The San Jose Improv formerly known as the Jose Theater Jose Theatre built in 1904, this photo taken in 1935 The San Jose Improv is a comedy club located in San Jose, California.

She currently lives in Manhattan in New York City. Biography Born in Virginia Beach, Virginia, in 1981, du Bois later moved to rural, south-eastern Virginia with her parents at the age thirteen. After moving to Cambridge, Massachusetts, she began her formal training in composition with Osvaldo Golijov, Howard Frazin, and David Patterson and continued her training on violin with Lynn Chang and Sophie Vilker. At age sixteen, she began studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston and the Longy School of Music. She credits the solitude of the ocean and rural farmland as a child to her first impetus to start composing. A graduate of The Juilliard School and the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music with a Master of Music and a Bachelor of Music degree, respectively, du Bois began her earliest musical training on the violin at age two with Suzanne Schreck. While at Indiana University, she studied under the direction of composers Sven-David Sandstr√∂m, Claude Baker and Don Freund and violinists Federico Agostini and Henryk Kowalski; at Juilliard, du Bois' sole teacher in composition was Christopher Rouse. Du Bois has previously been composer-in- residence at Carnegie Hall through The Weill Music Institute's Professional Training Workshop: Kronos: Signature Works, Dartmouth College, Mammoth Lakes Music Festival, and Merkin Concert Hall through the Zoom: Composers Close Up series. In 2010, du Bois was composer-in-residence with Southwest Chamber Music throughout L.A. and Vietnam which preceded an artist residency at the Harrison House in Joshua Tree. Du Bois' music Alexandra du Bois in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2010 (bottom right) The music of du Bois appears to consistently attract commissions of commemorative connotation; in honor of the 35th anniversary of the University Chorus at the University of Massachusetts ‚Äì Boston in 2000, du Bois was commissioned to write Our Eyes for double a cappella choir; in honor of Kronos Quartet's 30th anniversary in 2003, du Bois was commissioned to write her first string quartet. Chosen from among the work of more than 300 composers from 32 countries as the inaugural recipient of the Kronos: Under 30 Project, du Bois wrote String Quartet: An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind for Kronos Quartet which she cites as a protest to the U.S . led invasion of Iraq. New York City's Kaufman Center commissioned du Bois' Cloud Watching in honor of their 50th anniversary in 2004; The Beaux Arts Trio commissioned her first piano trio (L'apothesose d'un reve) in honor of their 50th anniversary in 2004; Bargemusic commissioned Soleil sur Mer as part of their 30th anniversary celebration in 2007; during the 1000th anniversary of the founding of the city of Hanoi in 2010, du Bois' Within Earth, Wood Grows for chamber orchestra was premiered at the Hanoi Opera House by Southwest Chamber Music on March 19, 2010. Du Bois was Composer-in-Residence with Southwest Chamber Music in connection with their Ascending Dragon Music Festival. More recently, du Bois was commissioned by cellist Wendy Sutter (of Songs and Poems by Philip Glass) for a multi-movement cello work,\\" the Savannah Music Festival for a second chamber work commission featuring violinist Daniel Hope, Present Music and PALS Children's Chorus for choral/instrument works, and the Anchorage Symphony and Cabrillo Festival Orchestra for orchestral works. Alexandra du Bois' compositions have been performed on five continents at venues including Carnegie Hall, New York; Concertgebouw, Amsterdam; Barbican Hall, London; Th√©√¢tre de la Ville, Paris; Kursaal Centre, San Sebastian; Smetana Hall, Prague; Teatro Gran Rex, Buenos Aires and Hanoi Opera House, Hanoi, Vietnam, De Oosterpoort, Groningen and Muziekcentrum Frits Philips, Eindhoven. =Night Songs= Du Bois' third string quartet, Night Songs (Nachtliederen), also commissioned by Kronos Quartet, was composed from inspiration received from the letters and diaries of Holocaust victim Etty Hillesum. As explained by NewMusicBox.com, \\"The music born of this was starkly touching, conveying the complexity of individual human darkness rather than the epic turmoil of nations in a time of genocide.\\" Du Bois stated of the nature and title of the same composition: ‚ÄúNight can represent the darkness of that time, of humanity, but it also represents the unconscious. Etty Hillesum was always uplifting‚Äîshe was almost always singing a song. She had an incredible sense of inner light.‚Äù In 2004, du Bois received a grant from The Netherland-America Foundation and traveled throughout the Netherlands and Poland to retrace Hillesum's footsteps in preparation for writing the quartet. Kronos Quartet presented the New York premiere of du Bois' third string quartet alongside the world premiere of Henryk Gorecki's third string quartet (\\"...songs are sung\\") at Carnegie Hall on March 24, 2005.

It is the only known Joplin composition to be originally released on piano roll instead of in musical notation. Form The overall structure of the piece is:Jasen (1978): 100 : Intro AA BB A CC Intro A The structure is unusual for a Joplin rag; Edwards characterized it as a rondo. The recapitulation of the A strain at the end is also found in \\"Magnetic Rag\\" and \\"Scott Joplin's New Rag\\", which appeared about the same time. The introduction and the A strain are both in B-flat major. At the start of the B strain, the piece modulates to G minor. Edwards describes this section as \\"well developed\\". The C strain is in E-flat major. The phrasing is notably uncharacteristic of Joplin rags. While it was typical to repeat the beginning phrase at the halfway point of a strain, or otherwise lead into a different melody that resolves by the sixteenth bar, here it abruptly pauses at the eighth bar before modulating to C minor in the ninth bar. The rhythmic momentum later does not subside on the tonic chord during the first repeat ending of the strain but rather continues as the strain is repeated. The phrasing is than perceived as starting at the ninth bar and ending on the eighth bar through the repeat. Jasen and Tichenor wrote that it \\"sounds as though it consists of three fragments put together\\". Publication history \\"Silver Swan Rag\\" was never copyrighted or published in Joplin's lifetime. Though two companies (QRS Music Roll Company and National) issued piano roll recordings of it in 1914, the piece was neglected for many years. Interest in Joplin's music revived in the 1960s. In 1970, a copy of the National roll (which did not credit Joplin) was discovered in the garage of a collector. While some doubted its authenticity, the piece was transcribed into musical notation for inclusion in Vera Brodsky Lawrence's The Collected Works of Scott Joplin, published in 1971. The copyright for \\"Silver Swan Rag\\" was assigned to the Lottie Joplin Thomas Trust. Later in the 1970s, concerns about the piece's authenticity were allayed by the discovery of the QRS roll, which credited Joplin as the composer.

Respect for the name of God is one of the Ten Commandments, which some Christian teachings interpret to be, not only a command to avoid the improper use of God's name, but a directive to exalt it through both pious deeds and praise.The Ten Commandments: Interpretation: Resources for the Use of Scripture in the Church by Patrick D.

Pink (Dec 30, 2007) pages 23-24 In Revelation 3:12 those who bear the name of God are destined for the new Jerusalem; which will come down (to earth) from heaven. John 17:6 presents the teachings of Jesus as the manifestation of the name of God to his disciples. John 12:28 presents the sacrifice of Jesus the Lamb of God, and the ensuing salvation delivered through it as the glorification of the name of God, with the voice from Heaven confirming Jesus' petition (\\"Father, glorify thy name\\") by saying: \\"I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again\\" referring to the Baptism and crucifixion of Jesus. The Bible usually uses the name of God in the singular (e.g. Ex. 20:7 or Ps. 8:1), generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God. However, general references to the name of God may branch to other special forms which express his multifaceted attributes. Scripture presents many references to the names for God, but the key names in the Old Testament are: God the High and Exalted One, El Shaddai and YHWH (on the meaning of the latter name there is almost no agreement).Walter C. Kaiser, Jr., Exodus (Zondervan 2017) In the New Testament Theos, Kyrios and Patƒìr (œÄŒ±œÑŒÆœÅ i.e. Father in Greek) are the essential names.Manual Of Christian Doctrine by Louis Berkhof (Aug 1, 2007) pages 19-20 Old Testament YHWH, the Hebrew Name for God. The simplest form by which God is referred to in the Old Testament is ElMercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 page 336 (see proper names of earlier Canaanite gods). Elohim (singular Eloah) is likely derived from the same root and points to God as being strong and mighty, able to judge and to strike fear. Elyon refers to elevation and being exalted.Systematic Theology by Louis Berkhof (Sep 24, 1996) pages47-51 These are, however, not proper names for God, but epithets also used for rulers and judges. Adonai has a similar context and refers to God as a powerful ruler. Similarly, El Shaddai, derived from \\"shad\\" i.e. Lord, also points to the power of God. Yahweh is the principal name in the Old Testament by which God reveals himself and is the most sacred, distinctive and incommunicable name of God. Based on Lev, 24:16: \\"He that blasphemes the name of Yahweh shall surely be put to death\\", Jews generally avoided the use of Yahweh and substituted Adonai or Elohim for it when reading Scripture. The pronunciation of YHWH in the Old Testament can never be certain, given that the original Hebrew text only used consonants. The English form Jehovah was formed during the Middle Ages by combining the Latinization of the four consonants YHWH with the vowel points that Masoretes used to indicate that the reader should say Adonai when YHWH was encountered. Thus Jehovah was obtained by adding the vowels of Adonai to the consonants of YHWH. Jehovah appears in Tyndale's Bible, the King James Version, and other translations from that time period and later. For instance, Jehovah's Witnesses make consistent use of Jehovah. ' Many English translations of the Bible translate the Tetragrammaton as ', following the Jewish practice of substituting Adonai for it. In the same sense as the substitution of Adonai, the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible to Greek mainly used the word Kyrios (, meaning 'lord') for YHWH.The Letters of Paul, Fifth Edition by Calvin J. Roetzel (Oct 30, 2009) pages 21-22 Apostle Paul was likely familiar with the use of the term Kyrios in the Septuagint and used it in his letters to refer to Jesus, thus signifying his divinity.Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 pages 520-525 The pronouncement \\"I Am that I Am\\" in Exodus 3:14, in rabbinical scholarship taken as a gloss on the meaning of the Tetragrammaton, was in Hellenistic Judaism rendered as .

Sanctity and power of the name = More than a name = A 1768 Ten Commandments parchment Although in some modern cultures names are simply labels and designators that distinguish one item from another, in Christian theology the names of God have always had much deeper meaning and significance. In the religious sense, the names of God are not human inventions, but have divine origin and are based on divine revelation. Veneration of the name of God goes back to the Old Testament, and as in Exodus 20:7, the Ten Commandments state: \\"You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the L your God\\".Christian Ethics by D. Stephen Long (29 Jul 2010) page 32 Christian teachings view this commandment as not simply an avoidance of the use of the name of God, but as a directive to exalt it, through both pious deeds and praise. In Christian teachings, the name of God is not simply a label, but involves divine mysteries that require and preempt respect and praise. Louis Berkhof states that the issue surrounding the use and interpretation of the names of God provide a theological puzzle in that given that God is \\"infinite and incomprehensible\\", His names transcend human thought, yet they allow Him to be revealed to humans as he descends to what is finite and comprehensible. Thus the name of God has always been revered in the Christian tradition, and has been associated with His presence.International Standard Bible Encyclopedia(E-J) by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Mar 1982) pages 504-507 =Name of God, way of God= The traditions and the hymnody of Christian liturgy have for long emphasized the importance of acting in the name of God, e.g. the Sanctus (which may go) states: \\"Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord\\".Perspectives on Christian Worship by J. Matthew Pinson, Timothy Quill, Ligon Duncan and Dan Wilt (Mar 1, 2009) pages 64-65 Going back to Church Fathers such as Cyril of Alexandria, in Christian teachings the name of God has been seen as a representation of the entire system of \\"divine truth\\" revealed to the faithful \\"that believe on his name\\" as in John 1:12 or \\"walk in the name of the Lord our God\\" in Micah 4:5.John 11-21 (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture) by Joel C. Elowsky (May 23, 2007) page 237 This is further shown in Jesus' Farewell Discourse to His disciples at the end of the Last Supper, in which He addresses the Father and in John 17:6 and 17:26 states: :\\"I manifested Thy name unto the men whom Thou gavest me out of the world.\\" (17:6) :\\"I made known unto them Thy name, and will make it known\\" (17:26) In Revelation 3:12 those who bear the name of God are destined for the new Jerusalem; which will come down (to earth) from heaven. Theological Dictionary of the New Testament by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich and Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Jul 10, 1985) page 1035 In Christian teachings, although the people of God bear the name of God, even they can offend the name of God by transgressing against the nature of God, and disobeying His commandments, as in Romans 2:24: \\"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.\\".The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Feb 1, 1995) page 482 =Hallowed be thy name= The Lord's Prayer, in Matthew 6:9, 1500, Vienna The first petition in the Lord's Prayer is \\"hallowed be thy name\\" and is addressed to \\"Our Father who art in Heaven\\". In his 4th century sermon \\"Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom Come\\", Gregory of Nyssa referred to Romans 2:24 and Ezekiel 36:23 which states: :\\"And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh, saith the Lord Yahweh, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.\\" Gregory stated that the petition that starts the Lord's Prayer deals with the insults, disregard, and inattention to the honor of God's name and seeks to remedy that through the pious actions of believers.Gregory of Nyssa, \\"Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom Come\\", Sermon 3, in The Lord's Prayer: A Survey Theological and Literary by Nicholas Ayo (Feb 2003) pages 125-129 Modern Christian theology has continued that teaching, and also adds that the remedy also involves the judgement of God against those who disrespect his name. In John 12:27 Jesus submits a petition to the Father and receives a response: :\\"Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.\\" The first glorification refers to Matthew 3:17: \\"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\\" at the start of the ministry of Jesus with his baptism, and the second to his upcoming crucifixion. Thus in John 12:30 Jesus explains to the crowd who hear the voice: \\"This voice hath not come for My sake, but for your sakes\\", referring to his crucifixion as the key element of the path to salvation. Wiersbe Bible Commentary by Warren W. Wiersbe (Nov 1, 2007) page 274 Other prayers in various Christian traditions have continued to refer to the name of God, e.g. the Catholic Golden Arrow prayer begins with:Ann Ball, Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices 2003 pages 209-210A collection of my Favorite Prayers G. P. Geoghegan (Dec 2, 2006) page 106 The widespread use of the Jesus Prayer in the Eastern Orthodox Church has also been associated with the power of the name of God, with continuing theological discussions.The Jesus Prayer by Lev Gillet and Kallistos Ware (Apr 16, 1987) page 85 See also * Attributes of God in Christianity * Imiaslavie * Names of God * Names of God in Islam * Names of God in Judaism References Category:God in Christianity ","title":"Names of God in Christianity"},{"id":"23905017","text":"Katie Chonacas is an American actress.

The high structure could be seen from miles around, for example from Blackpool and Winter Hill. To some people of the local area it was an instantly recognisable symbol of home coming after being away for weeks. It was built in 1969 in the Blowick area of Southport (1.7 miles from the town centre) ‚Äì . It acted as a storage unit guaranteeing the town's gas supply. Similar structures were built across the country when town gas was generated from coal and before the construction of a high pressure gas grid. Decommission and destruction The largest tower was decommissioned in January 2008, due to an environmental risk posed by the storage of oil within it. Discussions soon came as it was decommissioned and just weeks later it was decided by National Grid plc, that two out of the three gas holders (including the largest) would be completely demolished as soon as mid-2009. This sparked mixed reviews. Some people thought that the tower was a symbol of Southport, and should not be destroyed. Others however (mostly those who lived directly in the shadow of the tower) disagreed and could not wait to see the back of it. The tower caused problems for local residents such as poor TV reception. On Tuesday 14 April, demolition men arrived to start dismantling the 1,100 tonne structure. The second largest crane in Britain came to dismantle the iconic structure and in less than seven weeks it was gone from the Southport skyline forever. The gas holder may be the largest structure the town will ever see. The future After the destruction of the tower there was a mixed reaction from the local residents, some felt they had lost an icon while others felt the tower was an eyesore, and the removal may even affect house prices. The future of the third holder is still uncertain due to costs of removal. 'Ground Zero', how some people like to call the site where the gas tower once was, has yet to be developed but it is said it will be either housing and/or for business use. Some people have suggested that there should be something to remember the gas tower, but this idea has not yet been agreed on.

(Amis includes another essay on nuclear weapons in his collection Visiting Mrs. Nabokov, \\"Nuclear City: The Megadeath Intellectuals\\". It was written during the publication year of Einstein's MonstersMartin Amis, \\"Nuclear City\\", Esquire, September, 1987. and covers similar ground: \\"When nuclear weapons become real to you, when they stop buzzing around your ears and actually move into your head, hardly an hour passes without some throb or flash, some heavy pulse of imagined supercatastrophe.\\"Martin Amis, Visiting Mrs. Nabokov: And Other Excursions. London: Jonathan Cape, 1993. P. 44.) The five stories are: * \\"Bujak and the Strong Force, or God's Dice\\" * \\"Insight at Flame Lake\\" * \\"The Time Disease\\" * \\"The Little Puppy That Could\\" * \\"The Immortals\\" Introduction and stories =\\"Thinkability\\"= The book is introduced with an essay entitled \\"Thinkability\\", where Amis argues that many previous efforts at writing about nuclear warfare are flawed (with the notable exceptions of Jonathan Schell's The Fate of the Earth and The Abolition) because they presume that the damages of nuclear warfare can be placed into proportion and therefore debated about, mitigated, even justified. Amis contends that the magnitude of nuclear warfare is so inconceivable that such presumption is immoral and \\"subhuman\\", and that writers are only beginning to learn how to write about them properly. (He writes: \\"My impression is that the subject resists frontal assault.\\") =\\"The Immortals\\"= The story is told from the first person point of view of a being who is immortal and has existed for millions of years. The narrative of the story consists of the story of the development of the earth including the evolution of all life including humans and the history of the human race through nuclear Armageddon and the end of human life on earth. This narrative is interspersed with a narrative of the narrator‚Äôs interaction with the world including humans and a pet elephant that lived a hundred years and his satiric, snobbish evaluation of various time periods or people. In reality, the whole story is the imaginings of one of a group of people living by a polluted well in New Zealand at the end of the world; all of these imagine themselves to be immortal when in reality they are dying. The narrator, an ultimately unreliable narrator, acknowledges that this is the case with the others at the well, but that he really is immortal.

It is considered a part of the jazz standard repertoire. Without Ory's consent, lyrics were written for the instrumental tune in 1950 by Ray Gilbert. After Gilbert protested that he was entitled to share credit with Ory, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers awarded him one-third credit on all performances of \\"Muskrat Ramble\\", vocal and instrumental. History Kid Ory said that he originally composed the tune \\"Muskrat Ramble\\" in 1921, and that the title was made up by Lil Hardin at the 1926 session when it was first recorded by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five. Armstrong, on the other hand, claimed in an interview to have written the tune himself, and that it was Ory who only named it. Thomas Brothers has suggested that Armstrong wrote the first strain and that Ory wrote the second strain. Sidney Bechet has said that it was originally an old Buddy Bolden tune called \\"The Old Cow Died and the Old Man Cried\\". Owing to a misprint, or the record company's sensibilities, the tune was titled \\"Muskat Ramble\\" on its initial release. The tune contains a 32-bar ensemble section at the beginning, followed by 16-bar solo sections for the trombone, cornet and clarinet. After the solos, an ensemble section of 32 bars is played, followed by a two-bar trombone tag. Ory's tag at the end is almost always copied in performances. In the ensemble sections, the clarinet, cornet and trombone play a three-part counterpoint line typical of 1920s New Orleans bands.

New York: Oxford University Press, > 1986. Ory said that his publisher, the Melrose Publishing Company, had sold the song to another company and he had never received \\"nickel one\\". Through friends in the music publishing business Bigard identified the current publisher of \\"Muskrat Ramble\\", and he took Ory to their offices. Bigard described the exchange in his autobiography: > We waited a few minutes and in we went. \\"Hello, Mr. Levy,\\" I said. \\"I'd like > to introduce you to a man who composed a tune that you publish and gets > played all the time. This is Edward 'Kid' Ory, and he has never gotten a > dime in royalties.\\" ‚Ä¶ They must have looked high and low for him all right. > All they had to do was look in the union book. Ory received a check for around $8,000 on the spot, and royalties of about $600 every quarter thereafter. \\"That started him buying his new home,\\" said Bigard, who noted a change in Ory from then on. \\"At first it was nothing big, but do you know that he never thanked me for getting straight with his royalties. Never said a word. Maybe success was having something to do with it. ‚Ä¶ I didn't stay around till the end, but he was making a lot of enemies. He just was a different guy than I had known and helped ‚Äî been glad to help, in fact.\\" =ASCAP decree= Ray Gilbert wrote lyrics to the originally instrumental tune in 1950. In 1951 Gilbert protested to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers that his lyric ‚Äî written without Ory's permission ‚Äî added value to the tune and entitled him to share equal credit with Ory. ASCAP's Classification Committee decreed in 1956 that Gilbert was entitled to a third of all performance credits of \\"Muskrat Ramble\\", both vocal and instrumental, retroactive to 1950. \\"In spite of ASCAP's disavowal of setting a precedent,\\" wrote Billboard magazine, \\"the decision is regarded as likely to spark similar protests on the part of other lyricists who have added words to established instrumentals in the past. It also raises something of a moral issue in that the trade is wondering if the decision bespeaks ASCAP's approval of publishers adding lyrics to an instrumental work without the consent of the composer.\\" =Ory vs. McDonald= Babette Ory, Kid Ory's daughter from his second marriage and heir to the \\"Muskrat Ramble\\" copyright, sued Country Joe McDonald for copyright infringement in 2001. The complaint alleged that the tune for McDonald's signature song \\"I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag\\"‚Äîspecifically the chorus that begins, \\"And it's one, two, three, what are we fighting for?\\"‚Äîwas lifted in part from \\"Muskrat Ramble\\". The song was famously performed by Country Joe and the Fish at Woodstock in 1969. This suit was dismissed due to the lateness of the filing. Since decades had already passed from the time McDonald composed his song in 1965, Ory based her suit on a new version of it recorded by McDonald in 1999. Judge Nora Manella, then of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, upheld McDonald's laches defense, noting that Ory and her father were aware of the original version of the song, with the same questionable section, for some three decades without bringing a suit. This ruling was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2005, and Ory was also ordered to pay McDonald's substantial attorneys' fees.

He topped Port's goal-kicking in 1986 and 1987, with 49 and 71 goals respectively, ending the sequence of nine leading goal-kicker awards from Tim Evans.

Two rounds later he played his best game for Adelaide when he had 24 disposals and kicked four goals and five behinds in a win over Sydney at the SCG, with his fellow Port Adelaide key forward Scott Hodges bagging six of his own.

(6 June 1800 ‚Äì 4 September 1833), was a Belgian- born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church who served as Bishop of New Orleans from 1830 until his death in 1833. Biography Born in Wevelgem, West Flanders, Leo-Raymond de Neck√®re studied the classics and philosophy at the College of Roeselare, and attended the seminary of Ghent. He accepted an invitation from Bishop Louis Dubourg in 1817 to serve as a missionary in Louisiana, United States, arriving in September of that year. He completed his studies at St. Mary's of the Barrens Seminary in Perryville, Missouri, on the outskirts of St. Louis, and there joined the Congregation of the Mission (also known as the Lazarists or Vincentians) in 1820. De Neck√®re was ordained to the priesthood on 13 October 1822. He then worked as a missionary and seminary professor before becoming superior of St. Mary's Seminary in 1826. While in Europe to recuperate his health, de Neck√®re was appointed the first Bishop of New Orleans by Pope Pius VIII on 4 August 1829. Returning to the United States, he received his episcopal consecration on 24 June 1830 from Bishop Joseph Rosati, C.M., with Bishops Michael Portier and John England serving as co-consecrators, at St. Louis Cathedral. He convoked a synod of the diocesan clergy in February 1832 and established New Orleans' first English-speaking parish, St. Patrick's Church, in April 1833. After an outbreak of yellow fever in 1833, de Neck√®re, who had retired to Convent, returned to the episcopal see of New Orleans, where he himself fell victim to the fever and soon died at age 33.

He was born in Scotland and immigrated to Canada in around 1900 when he was in his twenties. A carpenter by trade he built a home in on Merton Street in North Toronto. He then became a developer, building several other homes around the area. He married Jesse Coutts, but she died in 1928 after being hit by a golf ball. He served eight years on Toronto city council before being elected to the Board of Control in 1947. He became well known for his work officially greeting soldiers as they returned to the city during both the Second World War and the Korean War. He was in charge of notifying family members when a troop train would be arriving, and personally greeted almost every train to come into the city. This work earned him an MBE. Another cause was improving the safety of service stations and their employees. As a result of this after his death it was proposed that all service stations shut down for five minutes in honour of him. Innes topped the polls in the Board of Control election of 1949, and thus won the powerful budget director position. It was widely expected that he would run for mayor in 1951, succeeding Hiram E. McCallum. However, Innes died unexpectedly in July of that year of a heart attack. One of the best known politicians in Toronto, his sudden death was a considerable surprise.

Mehmet) Okonsar David Ezra Okon≈üar (; born 20 October 1961, Istanbul) is a Turkish-Belgian (double nationality) pianist, composer, conductor, writer and educator. He was previously known as \\"Mehmet Okon≈üar\\".  Biography  David Ezra Okon≈üar was born in Istanbul (Turkey) with the first name \\"Mehmet\\" and lived in Paris during his first schooling. He started studying piano at the Hacettepe University Ankara State Conservatory, with and Necil Kazim Akses. Thanks to the rich resources the Ankara Conservatory then possessed and the M√©diatheque of the Centre Culturel Fran√ßais d'Ankara, he grew up studying the music of Pierre Boulez, Edgard Varƒóse, Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Schaeffer, composers who would have a strong influence on him. After about a year and half studying at the Ankara Conservatory, the family moved to Belgium where he entered the class of Jean-Claude Vanden Eynden at the Brussels Royal Conservatory of Music. Vanden Eynden, who was to entirely re-shape the keyboard technique of Okon≈üar, is a dedicated follower of the style of Eduardo del Pueyo. The keyboard technique of del Pueyo and Vanden Eynden is based on the work of Marie Ja√´ll, a pupil of Franz Liszt. A change of Government in Turkey and the political turbulence of 1977 forced the Okon≈üar family to return to Ankara. Back at the Ankara Conservatory he was put in the class of for piano and of Nevit Kodallƒ± for musical composition. Okon≈üar did not attend either class with much assiduity. During this period he was connected on both a friendly and a professional basis with the pianist and conductor Selman Ada. From this friendship he learned the basics of the keyboard principles of Pierre Sancan of whom Selman Ada has been a student. His first important recital took place in 1979. The program included Pr√©ludes by Messiaen and the Pictures of an Exhibition by Mussorgsky. Just before the military coup of 1980 the Okon≈üar family returned to Belgium. He resumed studying with Jean-Claude Vanden Eynden. In 1980 Okon≈üar was awarded the Premier Prix avec Distinction.The first level of the \\"High Education in Music\\" diploma the Brussels Royal Conservatory awarded at the time His program included the Dante Sonata by Liszt. His studies continued after the sudden death of his father with a special scholarship and he was awarded the The second level diploma of the Brussels Conservatory, equivalent to the Masters in Art degree, given as a result of a competition-like public performance. Dipl√¥me Sup√©rieur de Piano Avec la plus Grande Distinction, Premier Nomm√© in 1986 by performing the Piano Concerto Op. 42 by Arnold Schoenberg. At the end of his piano studies, Okon≈üar had the privilege of working with one of the greatest composers of Belgium: Madame Jacqueline Fontyn. He also studied with a pupil of Messiaen, Claude Ballif. In 1989 he obtained his degrees in Composition-Orchestration from the Royal Conservatory of Music of Brussels. Alexis Weissenberg, after listening to a recording by Okon≈üar invited him (on a scholarship) to study in Switzerland. He endorsed the Belgian citizenship in 1992 but at the same time the president of Turkey Suleyman Demirel awarded him the title \\"State Artist of the Turkish Republic\\". Therefore, Okonsar settled in Turkey with his wife, the painter Lale Okon≈üar. Okon≈üar works now from Turkey on a busy schedule concertizing, composing, writing and teaching. He owns and manages a CD label exclusive to his own recordings, LMO-Records, and a publishing company \\"inventor-music√¶\\". In August 2014, he took the first name(s): David Ezra.

Composer  David Ezra Okon≈üar started composing at the age of 11. His role-models were Arnold Schoenberg and Pierre Boulez. The compositions by Okon≈üar were from the beginning exploring unusual ensembles in an avant-garde line. During the eighties atonal (free) Jazz specially by Cecil Taylor and the intricate voicings by Bill Evans had strong impact on the total serialism Okon≈üar always used. Other extra-serialist influences are Krzysztof Penderecki, Iannis Xenakis and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. The electronic works created in the fifties and early sixties by Ligeti, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Xenakis, Henri Pousseur and others created a new and previously unheard approach to orchestration. The sound possibilities of the classical orchestra started to be conceptualized by the composers in terms of \\"sound envelopes\\", \\"sound filters and formants. Okon≈üar followed a similar path in his orchestrations, in the nineties. The music by Okon≈üar is extremely structuralist and calls for an analytical approach. This structuralism is presented in the finished score in a very detailed, complex and refined musical √©criture.

A number of geographic features in Arizona are named after him. Life Weaver was born Powell Weaver in White County, Tennessee, the son of a white German father, supposedly Frederick Weaver or John Weaver of Weaverville, North Carolina, and a Cherokee mother. As a young man he worked for the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company in Canada. In 1830 he traveled to the Rocky Mountains with a group of nearly 50 other men on a trapping expedition. The trip took him to Taos, New Mexico, which he adopted as a base for his trapping and trading. It was among the people of Taos that his given name Powell was changed to the more-familiar to Spanish speakers Paulino, which in turn was changed to Pauline by English speakers. In 1831 he traveled from Taos to California, going through Arizona for the first time. In August 1832 Weaver was baptized into the Catholic faith, and the following month he married Maria Dolores Martin in Taos.Ken Edwards, Pauline Weaver‚Äôs early life as a trapper and scout , Sharlot Hall Museum, accessed 10 November 2010. They had a son and two daughters. He later married a Native American woman in Arizona. Weaver settled at a ranch near Banning, California in 1845, and lived there for more than ten years. Weaver usually maintained excellent relations with the indigenous peoples of the region, and consistently tried to smooth relations between them and the American settlers. Despite the usually good relationship, Weaver was seriously wounded in an Indian attack in the 1860s.Marshall Trimble, Roadside History of Arizona, Missoula: Mountain Press, 1986, p.330. General Stephen Kearney recruited Weaver to scout for the Mormon Battalion in 1846. He served the military off-and-on for the next 20 years, as a scout and as intermediary between the Army and Indian tribes. During the Civil War, Weaver was the Chief of Scouts for the federal forces that engaged a Confederate unit on 15 April 1862 at the Battle of Picacho Pass in Arizona.Robert Flaherty, The California column and the March to Tucson, 1862. In 1862 Native Americans showed Weaver where gold could be found on the east side of the Colorado River. The discovery led to a gold rush and the establishment of La Paz, Arizona, now a ghost town. A year later Weaver later led the Peeples party on a prospecting expedition up the upper Hassayampa River to what are now the Weaver Mountains, where they found placer gold at Rich Hill, near present-day Yarnell, Arizona. In Weaver‚Äôs honor the mining district was named the Weaver District.Maureen G. Johnson, (1972) Placer Gold Deposits of Arizona, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1355, p.61, 76. Death and further travels Weaver died in 1867, and was buried at the Camp Verde army post with full military honors in recognition for his military service and for his services in keeping peace with the Indians. When the military closed the Camp Verde post, Weaver‚Äôs remains were moved to San Francisco, California. In 1929, Arizona Boy Scouts and school children raised money to have his body returned to Arizona, and he was buried for the third and final time on the grounds of the Arizona territorial capital at Prescott, Arizona.Marshall Trimble, Roadside History of Arizona, Missoula: Mountain Press, 1986, p.331.

A U.S. Navy destroyer escort was named for him. Navy career Alfred Wolf was born in Germany on 1 August 1923. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve at New York City on 7 January 1942 and went through United States Marine Corps Recruit Training at Newport, Rhode Island, between 11 January 1942 and 11 February 1942. Following further instruction at the Naval Operating Base, Norfolk at Norfolk, Virginia, he entered the Naval Armed Guard School at Little Creek, Virginia, on 23 March 1942. After completing the intensive training given the men preparing for Naval Armed Guard assignments at Little Creek, Wolf reported aboard the Liberty ship SS Samuel Chase on 20 April 1942 and was serving in that ship when she departed Iceland for the northern Soviet Union as part of Convoy PQ 17 on 27 June 1942. German planes attacked the convoy on 2 July 1943 and continued their raids over the next few days. The convoy's initially heavy supporting force of warships was drawn off; when the German battleship Tirpitz was reported to have sortied from Norway to attack the convoy, the merchant ships and what smaller escorts remained were ordered to scatter, greatly aiding the German attackers. Six near-misses from German bombers on 10 July 1942 caused heavy damage to Samuel Chase, snapping all steam lines, cutting off all auxiliaries, and blowing the compass out of the binnacle. Seaman First Class Wolf and her other gunners fought their weapons efficiently and courageously in what naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison called \\"the grimmest convoy battle of the entire war.\\" Morison lauded the Naval Armed Guard crews of three particular PQ 17 merchant ships: SS Washington, SS Daniel Morgan, and SS Samuel Chase. \\"Their clothing was inadequate and their ammunition insufficient,\\" he wrote, \\"but their fighting spirit never failed.\\" Samuel Chase managed to survive the ordeal of PQ 17, part of a pitiful remnant of the original convoy. Detached from Samuel Chase on 24 October 1942, Wolf reported aboard the United States Army Transport USAT Henry R. Mallory at New York City on 12 November 1942. On 17 November 1942, the transport departed for Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, and stopped at St. John's in the Dominion of Newfoundland and Halifax, Nova Scotia, in Canada before returning via Boston, Massachusetts, to New York City. Henry R. Mallory then once more visited Reykjav√≠k, departing New York City on 24 January 1943. She was en route to New York City on her return voyage in Convoy SC 118 when the German submarine U-402 torpedoed and sank her on the morning of 7 February 1943. Seaman 1st Class Wolf was not among the survivors. Awards For his part in the gallant defense of Samuel Chase during her battle as a part of Convoy PQ 17, Seaman 1st Class Wolf earned a Letter of Commendation which praised his meritorious conduct in action. Commemoration During World War II, the U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Alfred Wolf (DE-544) was named for Seaman First Class Wolf, but her construction was cancelled in 1944 before she could be launched.

Created between 1315 and 1317,Rowell (1994), p. 156 it had only two metropolitans and was discontinued in 1371. Its establishment was part of the entry of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the rivalry for the religious control of the Rus' principalities between Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, the Principality of Tver, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The Byzantine Empire, seat of the Patriarch of Constantinople, generally preferred a united Metropolitanate of Kiev and all Rus' and was reluctant to divide its authority. Therefore, whenever possible, the Byzantium would unite the metropolitanates. Facing opposition to actual physical division of the metropolitanates, the Lithuanians employed additional tactics: promotion of their own candidates to the seat of the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'. By the 1440s however, the final years of the Byzantine Empire, the Grand Duchy of Moscow had effectively won the dispute and became the new spiritual center of the Orthodox tradition in Eastern Europe. Establishment The Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded east at the expense of Slavic Orthodox principalities of the former Kievan Rus'. While adhering to the pagan faith, Grand Dukes Vytenis and Gediminas understood the political importance of controlling the church. At the time, Peter, the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus', supported by Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, rivaled with Mikhail Yaroslavich, Prince of Tver, who wanted to replace Peter with his own candidate.Rowell (1994), p. 152 As a result of this dispute, the seat of the metropolitanate was moved to Moscow.Rowell (1994), p. 154 Lithuania had a rather friendly relationship with Tver and perhaps the new metropolitanate was a way to support Mikhail Yaroslavich in his struggle with Metropolitan Peter, whose income was cut and authority in all of Rus' challenged.Rowell (1994), p. 157 The Byzantine Empire, afraid of the growing influence of local dukes, generally promoted church unity within the Rus', hoping that a strong united patriarch would be able to resist political intrigues.Rowell (1994), p. 170 Therefore, it is unclear why it agreed to establish a new metropolitanate; later the Byzantine authorities regarded it as an \\"anomaly\\" or the \\"result of confusion.\\" Possibly, Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos, involved in wars with the Ottoman Empire over Asia Minor, needed military and financial assistance, both of which Lithuania could provide.Rowell (1994), p. 157‚Äì158 The emperor established the metropolitanate while Patriarch John XIII ordained the prelate.Meyendorff (1989), p. 95 =Composition= * Metropolitan eparchy of Navahrudak and all Lithuania * Eparchy of Turov * Eparchy of Polatsk * Metropolitan eparchy of Halych * Eparchy of Volodimer * Eparchy of Peremyshel * Eparchy of Kholm * Eparchy of Luchesk Metropolitan Theophilus (ca. 1317‚Äì1330) The Metropolitanate of Lithuania, with the episcopal see in Navahrudak, had two suffragan bishops in Turov and Polatsk. From 1317 to 1330, it seems that there was only one metropolitan bishop, Theophilus of Rus' origin.Rowell (1994), p. 159 A surviving list of his property shows that Theophilus traveled extensively around the Rus' principalities and presented expensive gifts to prominent rulers of the region,Rowell (1994), p. 161 perhaps as part of a campaign to become the Metropolitan of Kiev. After Peter's death in 1326, however, Theophilus and a candidate presented by Moscow were rejected by Constantinople as too political. Instead, they appointed independent Theognostus as the new Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'. When Theophilus died in 1330, Theognostus succeeded in restoring unity in the Rus':Meyendorff (1989), pp. 155‚Äì156 claiming that there were too few Christians in pagan Lithuania, the seat of the Metropolitanate of Lithuania was left vacant.Rowell (1994), pp. 162‚Äì163 In case a need would arise in future, a new metropolitan could be appointed.Rowell (1994), p. 163 In the meantime, Theognostus would have authority over all Rus' and Lithuania. Metropolitan Roman (1355‚Äì1362) After Theognostus' death in 1353, at first Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas did not attempt to revive the Metropolitanate of Lithuania and instead promoted his own candidate Teodoryt to the see of Kiev and all Rus'. When he failed to gain support in the Byzantium, Teodoryt turned to the schismatic Bulgarian Orthodox Church and received ordination there.Meyendorff (1989), pp. 164‚Äì165 Such actions may indicate that Algirdas envisioned an autocephalous church of his own.Meyendorff (1989), p. 165 The angered Byzantines forced Algirdas to change his tactics. He now supported Roman, a monk from Tver and relative of Algirdas' wife Uliana, and even promised to convert to Orthodoxy in exchange for the ordination of Roman.Majeska (1984), pp. 388‚Äì389 Patriarch Callistus I, rivaled by Philotheus Kokkinos, agreed and ordained Roman as the Metropolitan of Lithuania in 1355.Rowell (1994), p. 165 Roman attempted to assert his authority over all Slavic lands of the Grand Duchy, even though they belonged to the Metropolitanate of Kiev and all Rus', whose patriarch Alexius resided in Moscow.Rowell (1994), p. 166 In 1356, after diplomatic struggles, Callistus I united the Metropolitanates of Lithuania and Galicia under Roman, while Alexius retained his title. The rivalry continued, however, until Roman's death in 1362, when Lithuania‚ÄìGalicia were placed under control of Alexius.Majeska (1984), p. 389 In 1371, the Metropolitanate of Lithuania was officially lowered to the rank of a bishopric and placed under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'. However, it did not end the political rivalry for religious influence in Rus'. Algirdas successfully promoted his candidate Cyprian while Alexius was still alive.Rowell (1994), p. 167 In 1415, Grand Duke Vytautas attempted to re-establish the Metropolitanate of Lithuania and promoted Gregory Tsamblak.Rowell (1994), p. 168 The rivalry effectively ended in 1448 when Moscow began selecting the patriarchs independently without approval from the Byzantium, which collapsed in 1453.Rowell (1994), p. 169 See also * Halych metropoly References Further reading  * External links * Lithuanian metropoly at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine Category:1310s establishments in Europe Category:1371 disestablishments in Europe Category:14th century in Lithuania Category:Eastern Orthodox metropolitans Category:Eastern Orthodoxy in Lithuania Category:Eastern Orthodoxy in Belarus Category:History of Christianity in Ukraine Category:Dioceses of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople Category:History of Christianity in Lithuania ","title":"Metropolitanate of Lithuania"},{"id":"23905949","text":"Henry Hewson was a professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s.

The corresponding Old French term was chanson couronn√©e or couronnez, which occurs is some extant chansonniers. There are twelve trouv√®re chansons in the manuscripts with rubrics indicating they were awarded a crown.The manuscripts are F-Pn fr.845, 12615 and 24432; n.a.fr.1050; CH-BEsu 389; and I-Rvat Reg.1522. There are no discernible differences between such pieces and other trouv√®re works save that they were probably the recipients of prizes. The Occitan troubadour chansonnier called the Can√ßoner Gil contains eight songs which it says were coronada (crowned).Can√ßoner Gil at Cervantes Virtual. Other songs that won prizes at various floral competitions are also indicated: one gazaynet la joia a Tholoza (\\"won the jewel at Toulouse\\"), another gazaynet la flor d'aglentina ... a Toloza (\\"won the eglantine rose at Toulouse\\"), and still another gazaynet la violeta (\\"won the violet\\"). In the musical theory of Johannes de Grocheio the cantus coronatus is class of popular music (musica vulgaris). After dividing the latter into the cantus and the cantilena, he subdivides each new category into three. The three forms of the cantus are the cantus gestualis (the chanson de geste), the cantus coronatus, and the cantus versiculatus (also called versicularis or versualis). The distinction between the latter two classes is not clear from the work, both being illustrated by examples from the trouv√®res. The distinguishing features of each class are described vaguely and Grocheio's subsequent comparison of popular music with ecclesiastical vitiates many of the distinctions (Ars musicae, 130:112): > Cantus coronati are normally composed by kings and nobles and they are > frequently sung in the presence of kings and princes of the earth, in order > that their souls may be moved to be daring and resolute, magnanimous and > liberal, characteristics that all make for good rule.

He also served as the Solicitor General of India from 2009-2011.  Career  Gopal Subramanium completed his schooling from St. Xavier's School, Delhi, closely followed by a degree in law from the University of Delhi. He commenced his career with Shardul S. Shroff, who established Amarchand & Mangaldas & Suresh A Shroff & Co in Delhi in 1980. He appeared as counsel for the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, often traveling to these states for hearings. He then worked under D. P. Wadhwa, who rose to become a judge of the Supreme Court and later under Soli Sorabjee, former Attorney General. In 1993, Mr. Subramanium was designated a Senior Advocate (the equivalent of a Queen's Counsel in the UK) suo motu by the Supreme Court, one of the youngest to be so designated in the Supreme Court's history. His varied work-experience includes: * Acting as counsel (in 1991 - 1992) to a judicial commission headed by Justice J. S. Verma (then a judge of the Supreme Court) to inquire into security lapses leading to the assassination of Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, the former Prime Minister of India. * Acting (in 1993) as \\"prosecuting counsel for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)\\" in the trial of persons accused of setting of a series of bomb blasts in Bombay. He acted as CBI's counsel in this matter till 2012 when appeals in this trial were heard by the Supreme Court. * Acting as a special commissioner appointed by the Supreme Court in 1994-1995 to investigate into allegations on wrongful detention of persons in mental hospitals in the State of Assam. * In 2001, he was appointed as counsel to a judicial commission headed by Justice K. Venkataswamy (a former Supreme Court judge), to inquire into sting operations carried out by a news publication to expose corruption in defence procurement transactions. * Shortly thereafter, he acted as the Special Public Prosecutor in the prosecution of accused of the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001. Between 2005 and 2009 he held the office of Additional a Solicitor General of India, and subsequently served as the Solicitor General of India from 2009-2011. During his tenure as Solicitor General, he also served as the Chairman of the Bar Council of India. As a senior law officer to the Government of India, Mr. Subramanium represented the Government, as lead counsel, in a wide range of matters involving complex questions of constitutional and criminal law such as : * Acted as the Special Public Prosecutor in the prosecution of Ajmal Kasab, the sole surviving terrorist who carried out attacks on Mumbai in November 2008. * Acting as lead counsel for the Union of India in the matter of Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India, wherein he defended state-sponsored reservations for Other Backward Classes of persons in India. * Acting as lead counsel for the Government of India in 2010-2011 in litigation concerning irregularities in allocation of 2G radio- spectrum bandwidth to various private telecom operators. * Acting as lead counsel for the Union of India in 2006 in the matter of Raja Ram Pal v.

Union of India, where he presented a report on the realities of trafficking of children in India, and assisted the Supreme Court in framing guidelines to deal with the menace of trafficking. Subramanium also represented the government in cases like OBC quota in central educational institutions, sealing of commercial buildings in residential areas of Delhi. He has assisted the Supreme Court as Amicus curiae in many cases including Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case. Along with T. R. Andhyarujina, he represented Novartis in the case Novartis v. Union of India & Others concerning evergreening of patents, a case which Novartis India managing director Ranjit Shahani described as \\"a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options.\\" In 2014, his name figured in the list of four people recommended by the collegium for appointment as Supreme court judges. However, on 25 June, he withdrew his candidature following media reports which said the Central government was objecting to his appointment because of his alleged links with corporate lobbyist Nira Radia and a negative report by Central Bureau of Investigation. In 2015, Gopal Subramanium appeared for multimillionaire business tycoon Mr. Mohammed Nisham, for the latter's bail plea in the Supreme Court of India. The businessman from Kerala was accused of crushing to death a security guard with his Hummer SUV over delay in opening the gates of his apartment. On October 9, 2015, the SC bench led by Justice Dipak Misra dismissed the arguments of senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, who appeared for Nisham, saying: \\"When you stay in the same apartment and you run over a poor security guard‚Ä¶ how can you expect us to give you bail?\\" The court added: \\"The accused does not seem to value the lives of the poor and destitute. But one should know poverty and the poor matter. There is pride in poverty. It teaches you.\\" The court also shot down Subramanium's argument that Nisham had clean records. \\"Your not being a history-sheeter does not matter here. The manner in which this crime has been committed does matter,\\" said the bench. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal appeared for Kerala State in this case. Resignation from the post of Solicitor General Subramanium resigned in protest of the government's decision to field a private lawyer, Rohinton Fali Nariman, in a telecommunications case before the Supreme Court. On 27 July 2011, the Ministry of Law and Justice, appointed Rohinton Fali Nariman, the son of jurist Fali Nariman as the Solicitor General of India for a period of three years. Incidentally, both Subramanium and Nariman were designated senior advocates by former Chief Justice of India M. N. Venkatachaliah on 13 December 1993. Recent Supreme Court judgments in black money case in which the court directed constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and the one declaring appointment of Special Police Officers as unconstitutional (in Salwa Judum case) were seen as the last straw for the exit of Subramanium. Subramanium said he will never take on the job of the Solicitor General again, because, by convention, such a thing has not been done. Former corporate lobbyist Nira Radia described Subramanium as \\"a very upright person\\" in a 2009 conversation with Ratan Tata, which emerged as a part of the leaked Radia tapes. Other activities Subramanium served as chairman of the Bar Council of India during his stint as the Solicitor General. He is credited with introducing the All India Bar Examination, a mandatory test for law graduates to be eligible to practice in India. Mr. Subramanium's arbitration experience includes appearing as lead counsel for Indian companies in ICC and domestic arbitrations. In addition, Mr. Subramanium also deposes as an expert witness on Indian law in SIAC and other international commercial arbitrations. He has also served as a member of the arbitral tribunal presided over by Justice R.S. Pathak, former Chief Justice of India and Judge, International Court of Justice in arbitration between Transammonia AG and MMTC Limited. Mr. Subramanium has also appeared in a number of landmark cases concerning the law of arbitration in India, including the BALCO case (2012), where the Supreme Court of India ruled on the applicability of Part I of the Indian Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, to arbitrations held in a foreign seat, and awards arising therefrom, and Sundaram Finance (1999) (in respect of a court's powers to grant interim protection to parties pending arbitration). He has appeared in a number of matters in the Supreme Court and various High Court concerning arbitrability of disputes, appointment of arbitrators and challenge to arbitral awards including those arising out of defence contracts, EPC contracts and infrastructure contracts. In 2013, Mr. Subramanium acted as a member of a Committee to Recommend Amendments to Criminal Laws (headed by Justice J. S. Verma), which recommended much-needed amendments to various Indian laws to ensure the safety and dignity of women and young children. Further, among his other scholarly works, Mr. Subramanium has contributed to, and edited, \\"Supreme But Not Infallible: Essays in Honour of the Supreme Court of India\\", a comprehensive work on the evaluation of the working of the Supreme Court of India, published in 2004 by the Oxford University Press. Awards and Accolades During his tenure as a law officer, Subramanium was honoured with the National Law Day Award for Outstanding Jurist, presented to him in 2009 by the President of India, for his consistent professional excellence and adherence to the highest traditions of the Bar. Subramanium's duties came to the fore at one of India's largest corporate litigation, by appearing on behalf of the Union of India and defended its interests in the gas dispute between Reliance India Ltd. and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. before the Supreme Court. He reckoned his calibre at the high-profile Murder case of Jessica Lal, as a Special Public Prosecutor, remaining conciliatory towards the strategic angles of the case as it involved the Indian National Congress . He was instrumental in conducting \\"National Consultation for Strengthening the Judiciary towards Reducing Pendency and Delays\\" and facilitated the incorporation of a Special Purpose vehicle, \\"Society for Delivery of Justice and Legal Reform\\".http://www.jgu.edu.in/sites/default/files/EventsFile/InvitationfortheJusticeJ.S.VermaFirstMemorialLecture.pdf Subramanium is a visiting professor at the University of Delhi, and was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Law (in 2013) by the Central University of Orissa, Koraput for his contributions to the development of law in India. He is also an associate member of the prestigious, 3 Verulam Buildings barristers'chamber of London. Senior counsel and noted jurist, Fali Nariman described Subramanium as a very competent advocate and lauded the introduction of bar exams, an initiative undertaken by Subramanium. In 2019, Subramanium was made a Foundation Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford.

In mid-2009, it was tested in Anand district in the Indian state of Gujarat in partnership with Tata Teleservices using Tata phones. Later, it was designed to operate on any basic mobile phones. In 2014, Ossian further upgraded the technology as Nano Ganesh M2M to monitor the water level of overhead water tanks on mobile phones and remotely control the water pump as per the lower and overflow levels of water in the tanks. Usage In some parts of India, farmers have to walk several kilometers to turn on the irrigation pumps that water their fields. With the electrical supply often erratic, they sometimes find that there is no electricity when they reach the pump. Nano Ganesh allows them to remotely check the availability of electricity, and to remotely turn the pump on and off, all through a mobile phone. It helps the farmers to easily access the remote water pumps avoiding exhaustive long travel over difficult terrain, bad weather, and hazardous locations. It also means growers don't have to wake up in the middle of the night, which is often the time electricity is available, to walk the long distances to their fields. They sometimes hire workers to walk the long distances to turn the pumps on and off. Technical specifications The application comprises an electronic hardware (modem) with a basic mobile connection and an external feature phone, that attaches to the starter on the irrigation pump (Latest models do not need external mobile phones). Using the regular mobile phone, the farmer can switch on or off the water pump by text message or active calling with an assigned code number for on and off, and acknowledges the status of the power or pump by a particular tone signals as well as text messages. Another version of Nano Ganesh is M2M based in which preset water levels in the overhead tanks are sensed by the magnetic float sensors whose signals are passed to the GSM based Nano Ganesh transmitter which sends the wireless commands of water levels to be displayed on the mobile phone. This allows the water operator to avoid climbing up the dangerous steps of risky overhead tanks for checking water levels and also avoid travels to the distant pumps. This helps to efficiently control the water pump to avoid overflowing of the water. Another Nano Ganesh modem is also available to alert the owner on mobile phone when there is a theft attempt of the modem, cable, or the pump itself. Awards and recognition Nano Ganesh application was a Grand Prize winner in Nokia's Calling All Innovators contest in emerging market category, which awards new mobile applications designed to improve quality of life. Nano Ganesh was nominee for the Global Mobile Awards announced by GSMA, London for the best mobile application in the world in Social-Economic category. Nano Ganesh has been a winner of DST Lockheed-Martin IIGP 2011 program.http://www.indiainnovates.in/list- selected/2011/final_28thApril_winners.pdf Nano Ganesh has been selected for recognition as a laureate in the Economic Development category for 2011, by The Tech Awards,The Tech Museum at San Jose, CA, USA. In 2015, Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (UNFAO) featured Nano Ganesh as one of the seven successful Information and Communication Tools for agriculture and rural developments. In 2017, Nano Ganesh was lively demonstrated in the Innovation City in M4D section of Mobile World Congress organized by GSMA at Barcelona, Spain. UNESCO-Pearson published the case story of Nano Ganesh as one of the 14 digital initiatives developed for empowering the low income population.

The DuWoong wetland is located in the south of the Sinduri coastal sand dune at Sinduri beach, Wonbukmeon, Taean, South Chungcheong Do. Its coastal length is 3.4 km and its width is 500 m, which is relatively wide. The Sinduri coastal sand dune was formed by sands carried to the coast many years ago. Characteristics The DuWoong wetland is a typical sand dune wetland. The term \\"sand dune wetland\\" denotes wetlands formed by sand dunes, but the DuWoong wetland is the only one which has the form of a lake with water. Unlike other wetlands, the DuWoong wetland‚Äôs base is formed with sand, and it does not allow sea water to penetrate even though it is located at the seashore. This distinction results from underground water which forms a large fresh water lake that prevents sea water from penetrating through to the coastal sand dune. Importance to people Although sand dunes may be considered useless land, in fact the region acts as a bridge connecting coastal ecology and inland ecology. It also protects the coastline and farmland from hurricanes and storm surges. People feel relaxed while watching the sand dunes. At sunset, seagulls flying over the sand dunes give mental comfort to visitors, and the location is recognized as one of the eight most beautiful scenic spots in Teaan. The DuWoong wetland is designated a National Treasure of South Korea by the Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea and also as an Ecosystem Preserved Area by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. In 2002, the Ministry of Environment designated DuWoong wetland as a \\"Wetland Protection Area\\". In December 2007, the DuWoong wetland was designated a Ramsar wetland.

The school follows the Haitian education system, with a primary school offering grades 13 (or k)-6, and a secondary schools from grade 7-to philo.  History  The school was founded by the Sisters of Charity of St. Louis, a congregation created in France by Marie Louise Elizabeth de Lamoignon on May 25, 1803. Gradually, the congregation had branched internationally to better accomplish their goal of offering a learning experience to young girls who don¬¥t have the condition to pay extremely high prices for quality education. This long journey eventually led to Haiti. Curriculum Both schools provides a curriculum rooted in Roman Catholicism and a strong sense of civic duty with daily prayer and other religious activities formally integrated as part of the learning process. At a very early age, students tend to be given individual projects requiring presentation in front of an audience to boost their confidence. In addition to following the criteria of the Haitian Department of Education, both schools offer a range of electives such as sewing, cooking, banking, arts and crafts, creative writing, engineering as well as computer sciences.

It was later used by Third Air Force. Today, it is the city-owned Coffeyville Municipal Airport, Kansas. History Early in 1942, the War Department decided to build a basic training field outside the town of Coffeyville, Kansas, one of eleven Army Air Forces bases the state would have before the end of World War II. The base was eagerly sought after by the town's community leaders. Many businessmen donated time and part of their expenses to get the base approved. Their efforts started in late 1941, with several visits by key city officials in Washington to talk with different agencies of the War Department. By Thanksgiving 1941, the Chamber of Commerce and the Airport Committee, received a commitment from the War Department for a site engineer to consider Coffeyville. The decision was made to build the base on May 8, 1942. The site was located seven miles north-east of Coffeyville, on a 1,456-acre tract of land which had been purchased by the United States government. Construction, which was accomplished by contract under the supervision of the U. S. District Engineers, Tulsa, Oklahoma, commenced on 1 June 1942. It had really started before when the county began to improve the road network around the new base to handle the increased truck traffic hauling construction material to the site. The weather didn't cooperate, as the latter part of 1942 was very wet, slowing construction; however, most of the construction was accomplished over the next eight months. When finished, the \\"Army Air Forces Basic Flying School. Coffeyville Kansas\\" had four runways, each 150 feet wide. The shortest was 5,872 feet. Most of the buildings were Theater of Operations construction while some were of the Mobilization type. The Mobilization type buildings included the station hospital, theater, chapel, and Link training buildings. There were three hangars with a parking apron a mile long and 450 feet wide were constructed. 'Where before there had been only open farm land, this new city now contained 212 buildings, a water storage and distribution system, sewage system and treatment plant, electric transmission lines, a railway spur, and all the other things one could expect to find in a town of 5,000 people. Its effect upon the city of Coffeyville was dramatic. The base was the first of its type to be established in Kansas and would graduate the state's first class of cadets. In addition to the main base and airfield, there were four auxiliary fields also constructed for emergency and training use in the area along with the use of Coffeyville Municipal Airport * Angola Army Auxiliary Airfield #1, comprising 206 acres, approximately 6.2 air miles to the southeast. * Edna Army Auxiliary Airfield #2, with 241 acres, about 14.25 air miles almost due east * Edna Army Auxiliary Airfield #3, with 633 acres, 12.5 air miles to the northeast. Auxiliary No. 3 was the only one with a regular concrete runway system. * Mound Valley Auxiliary Airfield #4 * Coffeyville Municipal Airport, comprising 241 acres, just over nine miles slightly east of north. It was normal for a new base, built under extreme time pressure, to have start up problems. Coffeyville was no exception. There was no running water, and no roads. Coffeyville AAF wasn't ready for personnel. The base housing facilities were not ready. Some men were living under a baseball stadium at Forest Park, a recreation area in the city of Coffeyville. Meals were also served there for a time before the base mess hall opened. The sewage system was not completed, and the water wasn't fit to drink because the pipes had not been cleaned. All drinking and cooking water had to be hauled from the city of Coffeyville in a street sprinkler. The electricity had been turned on and off intermittently during September, and came back on in the mess hall around 6 PM just as the troop train was backing into the siding. Due to a problem with the natural gas service, the first meal served at the base was barbecued wieners, instead of the originally planned roast beef. Dinner was about half finished when a cloudburst started. From then until January, 1943, the place was a sea of mud. Lots of jobs needed to be finished before the cadets arrived. At the time, there was no water tower, so for fire protection, a fire truck was rented from the city of Coffeyville, and crewed by a driver and firefighter hired from the city. The post refrigeration units were not complete, meats and other perishables were stored in the Coffeyville Ice and Cold Storage company until facilities at the field were ready. Runways were not completed, nor were any of the maintenance buildings or shops in the sub-depot area. Most of the major construction would not be completed until January 1943. Additionally, much remained to be built, i.e., taxiways, fencing, a crash station, a cadet operations building, some streets, and a civilian mess hall, etc. The fourth runway was started in July, later in August, the rebuilding of the original runways with concrete began. =Assigned units= The new base was placed under the jurisdiction of the 32d Flying Training Wing (Basic), Perrin Army Airfield, Texas. During July 1942 detachments of the following units were organized at Coffeyville: * 908th Quartermaster Company, Aviation (Service) * 852d Ordnance Company, Aviation (Service) * 778th Chemical Service Company (Aviation) * A Finance Department Early in September following detachments of two other units, the 1038th Guard Squadron and the 857th Signal Service Company, Aviation, were organized. These were followed before the end of the year by medical and veterinary detachments and by the 23d Airways Communications Squadron The first large number of base support personnel, about 600 men, came to the field by train, arriving on September 18 Coming for the most part from Enid Army Airfield, Oklaholma. The bulk of the original military personnel arrived at Coffeyville during October and November 1942. They included troops of the 366th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, the 317th Army Air Forces Band, and the 820th, 821st, 822d, and 823d School Squadrons. From a total of 63 officers and 190 enlisted men on 1 October 1942 the permanent party strength increased to 283 officers and 2,369 enlisted men by 1 February 1943 =Basic Flying School= Formation of Vultee B-13 Valiants from Coffeyville AAF, 1944 Photo of PX (front), Rec Center (left), Movie Theater (right) Stockade (right), Hangars, Control Tower, some BT-13s on the apron Parachute shop (front), flight line and parking ramp The mission originally assigned to Coffeyville was the basic, or second-stage, training of aviation cadets. Hence the designation, Army Air Forces Basic Flying School, when it was activated on 17 June 1942. As of 1 January 1943 it was re- designated the Coffeyville Army Air Field, although the mission was unchanged. From 6 August 1943 until 31 May 1944 the flying training unit at the field was known as Army Air Forces Pilot School (Basic). The training of cadets at Coffeyville actually began on 14 November 1942 with Class 43-C with 137 members from primary flying schools at Hatbox Field, Muskogee, Oklahoma. 116 graduated at the end of the course on 13 January 1943. Meanwhile, the second class, 43-D, with 156 cadets had begun training on December 1942. It completed the course, with 129 individuals graduating on 15 February 1943. This was about six months from the start of construction, and as was typical with most of the training bases, training began while the field was being completed. Training started on November 14. While in basic flying school the student pilot learned to fly a more advanced aircraft than he soloed in primary flight training. At the time, Basic was a 10-week course consisting of 70 hours flying, 94 hours in ground school, and 47 hours in military training. At the end of the basic training, the student moved on to advanced flight training at another base The trainer used at Coffeyville AAF was the Consolidated-Vultee BT-13 Valiant. Coffeyville received its first BT-13s on November 8, just eight days before the start of flight training. Since construction of the maintenance hangars was still in progress, maintenance was done outside on the parking ramp. To make matters more interesting, the sub-depot supply warehouses weren't finished, so parts were kept, and the sub depot operated in the City of Coffeyville at the Ford dealership. At first, maintenance personnel had to make their own desks, tables, and work benches. Important maintenance equipment and aircraft parts were not available, so occasionally aircraft were cannibalized to keep the remainder flying. Maintenance went on day and night. Like flight training, maintenance procedures and organization were consistently reviewed and improved. Eventually, a base mechanics school was established. This along with the other improvements, led to about 96 percent of all aircraft being available for training by June 1943. Early, only broad course objectives, requirements, and directives were received from higher headquarters. As time went by, these directives became more specific. As a result, the flight training program at Coffeyville continually changed. Additionally, training was hindered by lack of equipment, facilities, and trained personnel. Instrument training provides a good example of the continual evolution of training at Coffeyville At first, all instructors gave their students the appropriate instrument training. Later, this phase of training was delegated to a few instructors who specialized in this phase of the cadets training. During the winter of 1943 and 1944, all instructors took additional training and became qualified to teach instrument flying. So, the centralized training for instruments was stopped. Many felt this was a positive move, because the student could stay with the same instructor throughout his training at Coffeyville Later as directives became more specific, some instructors would complain about the lack of flexibility. Students were now required to spend a specific amount of time on specified maneuvers. To help with instrument training fifteen Link Trainers were put into operation in mid-December 1942 with Class 43-C. The course of instruction was 15 hours. One problem with the Link instructors was, they were trained at twelve different fields and so taught the course twelve different ways. Additionally, supplies were hard to get, and the training buildings were not suited for the task. A new building was built specifically for Link Training. By March 1944, there were thirty-four link trainers. For a time, there were six training squadrons at the field, eventually this settled down to three, they were the 822nd, 823rd, and the 825th. Sometimes it was necessary to schedule Sunday flying when inclement weather prevented flying during the week. Normal flying periods were one hour, except cross-country flights. Usually cross-country flights took place between Coffeyville and Claremore, Oklahoma, and Neosho, Joplin, and Nevada, Missouri. Others were flown between Coffeyville, Chanute, and Fort Scott, Kansas. Flight training consisted of several subjects that included, takeoffs and landings, aerobatics, cross- country navigation, and night flying. Ground school involved navigation, meteorology, radio communications, and aircraft recognition. Normally ground school was given between flying lessons. Sometimes it was done in the very early AM or after the evening meal. Typically the day would start with Reveille at 6:15 AM, followed by breakfast at 6:30. Flying would begin at 7:45 AM. If a student was not scheduled to fly he would be in ground school, drill, or involved in required athletics. By March 1943, the field had three control towers with three radio frequencies to help control student flights. Life was not all work for the cadets. The first USO dance for enlisted men was held on March 4, 1943. The first formal social function for the cadets was a dance at Memorial Hall in Coffeyville. Also, a cadet club was opened in Coffeyville on West Eighth Street. A wives club was formed and involved itself in many projects, the most important being welfare and Red Cross activities. This included helping the wives settle among strange surroundings, visiting cadets in the hospital, and decorating the cadet recreational buildings. The club met weekly and published a small mimeographed paper. The city of Coffeyville allowed the cadets to use the high school swimming pool, and reserved it for their use during part of the day. In addition, there were USO shows from time to time, and dances attended by invited guests from Coffeyville and surrounding communities. The bowling alley was opened in May 1943 and had six lanes. The field had its own radio show that was arranged and written by the special service staff. Sometimes it broadcast from Coffeyville on station KGGF. Golf was also available at reduced rates at Coffeyville's Hillcrest Country Club. The post had a gymnasium and several athletic fields for softball, football, and volleyball. No base was complete without its obstacle course and Coffeyville was no exception. The last basic flight training class, 44-G, held their graduation dance in Coffeyville's Memorial Auditorium on May 20, 1944. At this point in the war, there was no longer the need for the vast numbers of new pilots being produced by the many training fields, so Coffeyille received notice to close down. From beginning to end, approximately 4,840 cadets and aviation students began the basic flying course, in 16 separate classes, at Coffeyville. Incompletions, however, because of physical and flying deficiencies, serious accidents, and resignations were fairly numerous. As a result, only 3,881 successfully completed the course. =Third Air Force= On 1 June 1944 Coffeyville Army Airfield was transferred to Third Air Force as pilot training was wound down. The field's new mission was to train photo reconnaissance pilots. When it took over the field Third Air Force organized there the Coffeyville Replacement Training Unit (Photo Reconnaissance) which was assigned to Headquarters Reconnaissance Training Wing (Provisional). Three months later the unit was redesignated the Coffeyville Combat Crew Training Station (Photo Reconnaissance), with some emphasis being placed upon the preparation of photo-reconnaissance pilots for overseas movement. In mid-September it was assigned to the III Tactical Air Command. The first group of photo reconnaissance pilots reported to Coffeyville for training on 12 June 1944. Other groups followed in rapid succession. Operating at first on a 10-weeks' schedule, the students divided their time, roughly in the ratio of one to four, between ground school studies and flying training. In the beginning there were F-10 Mitchells being used. This was the photo-recon version of the B-25 medium bomber. However, during the latter part of the period the aircraft used generally for this part of the work was the F-5 Lightning, an unarmed photo recon version of the P-38. Commencing in January 1945 the students were required to complete four weeks of special instrument training before taking up their photo reconnaissance work. Because of limited facilities during the summer of 1945, some classes which had completed the instrument training course at Coffeyville were shipped to Will Rogers Army Airfield, Oklahoma, for the photo-reconnaissance work. During the latter part of July, however, the instrument training program was transferred from Coffeyville to Will Rogers AAF, while the photo reconnaissance section at Will Rogers was transferred to Coffeyville. During the 12-months' period ending on 4 June 1945 over 460 photo reconnaissance pilots completed all their training requirements at Coffeyville, and were shipped to staging areas for processing and assignment to overseas shipments. In addition, more than 200 pilots received their instrument flying training at Coffeyville, and were shipped to Will Rogers AAF for training as photo reconnaissance pilots. There was no diminution in this indicated rate of training during the few remaining weeks of World War II. =Inactivation= Finally on Tuesday morning, October 2, 1945, a telegram arrived from the War Department that said, \\"You are authorized to announce the temporary inactivation of Coffeyville Army Air Field, Coffeyville, Kansas on or about 1 October\\". All training stopped. The only exception was the completion of training for several Chinese students. Early in the post-war period Coffeyville Army Air Field was earmarked for eventual inactivation. In a temporary inactive status it was transferred to the Tactical Air Command on 21 March 1946. As soon thereafter as the necessary arrangements could be effected the Tactical Air Command transferred it to the Army's District Engineer, Seventh Service Command at Omaha, Nebraska who assumed jurisdiction over the field on 26 August 1946, pending disposition. Some buildings were sold and moved into town as temporary housing, one even found use as a bar. Excess supplies were hauled off to other bases, with the excess aviation gas going down the road to the nearby Independence Army Airfield, at Independence, Kansas. Finally on July 21, 1947 the War Assets Administration made a formal presentation of the deed to the City of Coffeyville. Current status 2006 USGS airphoto of the former Coffeyville Army Airfield Today, Coffeyville's airfield remains in use and is the center of a growing industrial park. Most of the World War II buildings were sold off, torn down, although unlike some former World War II training fields, several original buildings remain in use, including the sub-depot and the three original squadron hangars. Many of the original streets remain. Two of the three runways are in-use today by Coffeyville Municipal Airport. The terminal building was constructed on the wartime parking apron, although much of the parking apron consists of deteriorating concrete pads in one form or another. The NW/SE runway and the eastern N/S runways are abandoned, with sections of concrete removed. The airfield can be reached by driving on U.S. Route 169 north from Coffeyville.

Rusty must choose between returning to his old life and joining Denny in his. Principal cast * Patrick Tatten as Rusty * Dale Dymkoski as Denny * Johnny Kostrey as Daniel * Timothy Cole as Garrett Production Writer/director Lewis drew upon his own relationship experiences with a meth addict in creating the film: \\"A lot of things in the film are conversations and events I had, and a lot of direct quotes [became] lines....Denny's monologue was taken from a guy I met who was in AA and recovering, and lived in a single room.\\" The film was produced by noted independent filmmakers and frequent collaborators Robert Shulevitz and Charles Myers https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0795690/. Filming took place over a month in a number of Los Angeles locations and editing took another six months. Lucky Bastard features a soundtrack by William V. Malpede, who had also scored Lewis's previous film, FAQs. Critical response Critical reaction to Lucky Bastard has been sharply divided. L.A. Splash magazine called the film \\"the first disappointment\\" of the Outfest festival, citing Rusty's lack of visible emotional development and \\"two dimensional personae (sic)\\". The reviewer praises Dale Dymkoski's performance as Denny, noting the \\"desperate duplicity\\" he brings to the role. The film, she concludes, focuses on the wrong protagonist. The LGBT news and entertainment portal Edge concurs in this assessment. Noting that the film's premise would make for an interesting character study by examining why Rusty is so willing to jeopardize his relationship with his boyfriend, the reviewer concludes, \\"There is nothing going on here. No plot. No sense of time or place. No character development or plot momentum of any kind. We just watch a decent guy fall for a loser and wonder why?\\" Dismissing the camerawork as \\"strictly film-school\\" with little variance in shot or angle and although appreciative of the attractiveness of the two leads, the reviewer chides Lewis to remember that \\"Hunky boys do not a good film make.\\" Conversely, the Philadelphia Gay News calls Lucky Bastard a \\"bold and compelling drama\\" in which Lewis \\"takes a mature and more intimate direction\\". PGN cites Denny's monologue in particular, calling it \\"an emotional, dramatic moment that will likely rivet most viewers\\". Lewis anticipated this divided response. \\"I think that people in the gay community are going to see the film is right on the button, or not at all close. They will accept it strongly or dismiss it because they have their own experience of many of these issues.\\" References External links * Official site * Lucky Bastard at the Internet Movie Database Category:2009 films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Everett Lewis Category:Films about male prostitution in the United States ","title":"Lucky Bastard"},{"id":"23906208","title":"List of airlines of Palau"},{"id":"23906216","text":"Skyline Central, Manchester City Centre West Properties (UK) Ltd is a United Kingdom based property development company.

Main Street, at the corner of Main Street and Martin Luther King Way, in Merced, California. (29 pages, with maps and four photos) The theatre is significant both for its role as the social and cultural center of Merced from the Depression through the post World War II era and for its mix of Art Deco and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on May 1, 2009 and the listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of June 5, 2009. thumb The Golden State Theatre Company hired San Francisco architects the Reid Brothers to design the Merced Theatre. Another notable building they designed is the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California. They used what was at the time the most modern projection and sound technology, and the theatre was only the second building in Merced to have an air conditioning system. Their use of dramatic atmospheric features included castle facades and ventilators that sent \\"clouds\\" floating across the star-bespeckled ceiling. Builder Gian Battista Pasqualetti used steel from the Golden Gate Iron Works, ornamental iron from the San Jose Iron Works, and ornamental tiles from the Hispano Maresque Tile Company in Los Angeles to construct the Reid Brothers design for the multi- level, white stucco coated steel framed reinforced concrete building. A high tower rises above the marquee, and the orange neon block letters proclaiming MERCED can be seen for miles. The lobby includes a mural of Spanish exploration done by Dutch-born artist Antoon Bonaventure Heinsbergen. Original furnishings include Spanish style wooden sofas and chairs. The theatre originally seated 1,645 for filmed and live performances. For a time the Merced Theatre was part of the United Artist chain of theatres. In the early 1980s the theatre was divided into 4 sections cutting off the entire balcony section from the main theater and splitting both. Over time the theater has suffered some wear and tear, but received a full restoration near to its original single full stage and screen design and currently has a full season of touring shows and films.

Rivalries are occasionally created due to a particular event that causes bad blood between teams, players, coaches, or owners, but for the most part, they arise simply due to the frequency with which some teams play each other, and sometimes exist for geographic reasons. Rivalries in the NFL are commonly recognized as such by fans and players alike. While many rivalries are well established, others are of more recent vintage, accepted as existing by the nature of the competition and history between the two teams. Other rivalries have fallen by the wayside due to league realignment and reduction in frequencies of meetings. Many modern rivalries are formed simply due to the two teams being within the same division.  Foundation  Purely geographic rivalries are rare in the NFL, since crosstown rivals do not play each other nearly as often as in other leagues that have more games and place teams closest to each other into the same divisions (and therefore more opportunities to play other teams). For example, Major League Baseball teams face each league opponent at least six times in the regular season, and within a division as many as 19 times, while the National Hockey League scheduling policies in the 21st century ensured at least eight games (out of 82) with division rivals and ensured the two areas with multiple teams (New York and Los Angeles) had all of the teams in one area in the same division. In recent years, the NFL changed its scheduling formula to ensure every possible matchup happens within a four-year span, not counting pre-season games or the Super Bowl. A main factor in the fact that crosstown rivals are almost always in opposing conferences is history: in the three current markets (New York/New Jersey, Los Angeles, and San Francisco Bay Area) that have two NFL teams, all have one team (Jets in New York, Raiders in Oakland, Chargers in Los Angeles) that was a member of the American Football League. As part of the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger, all AFL teams had to be retained, even if it meant multiple teams in one metropolitan area; this was not a major issue, as the Raiders and San Francisco 49ers served separate parts of their metropolitan areas separated by San Francisco Bay, and the New York market, the most populous in the United States, supported two or more NFL teams through the 1930s and 1940s. Only in Los Angeles, which did not have two NFL teams until the Raiders moved there in 1980, has there been difficulty in supporting two NFL teams at the same time, a factor in both the Rams and Raiders leaving in 1995. The newly merged league opted not to go through an extensive geographical realignment, and instead, the AFL formed the basis of the AFC, and the old NFL formed the basis of the NFC; as a result, each team ended up in an opposite conference from their crosstown rival. This allowed the combined league to retain both existing television partnerships of each league‚ÄîNBC for the AFL/AFC, and CBS for the NFL/NFC‚Äîinstead of choosing one or the other (ABC joined the mix in 1970 with Monday Night Football, giving all of the Big Three television networks NFL rights and effectively shutting out any further potential competitors). NFL policy currently requires any teams who play in the same metropolitan area to play in opposite conferences; if any relocations cause two teams from the same conference to share a metropolitan area, one of the two teams must move to the other conference. = Categories =  Division rivals  Games between opponents in the same NFL division. Since 2002, there are 32 teams in eight divisions of four teams each. Each team plays each division opponent twice in the regular season (once at home, once away) for a total of six regular season games out of 16 total. Occasionally, two teams will play three times in a year if they meet again in the playoffs. The Chiefs, Cowboys, Packers, Patriots, and Steelers are the only teams with winning records against all of their current division rivals for rivalries going back at least 20 years.  Conference rivals  Teams do not play a given conference opponent from outside their division more than once during the regular season. However, they may meet again for a second time in the playoffs. The NFL schedules divisions to play against each other on a rotating basis, so that every team from one division will play every team from another division, for a total of four games per team. Each team will also play one team from each of the remaining two divisions within the conference that finished in the same divisional standing position in the prior year‚Äîfor a grand total of 96 intra-conference games. Conference games are often important, as a team's record in common games, as well as its overall record against its conference, is sometimes used as a tiebreaker for playoff seeding at the end of the regular season. Also, many regular season opponents have met again in the playoffs, and the result of a regular season game can affect where the playoff game will be played. Conference rivals will play each other at least once every three years in the regular season, and as frequently as once every year depending on record, and can play each other in the preseason.  Inter-conference  Teams do not play a given inter-conference opponent more than once during the season unless they were to meet up in the Super Bowl. The NFL schedules inter-conference divisions to play each other exactly once on a rotating basis within a four-year cycle. For instance, given the 2012 NFL season as a reference, the NFC East played the AFC North during the 2012 season, then the AFC West during the 2013 season, AFC South during the 2014 season, and finally the AFC East in the 2015 season before repeating the cycle. The league also schedules inter-conference games on an eight-year cycle so any particular team will both host and visit any given team in the league within eight years.NFL scheduling#Formula Inter-conference rivals may play each other more frequently in the preseason, where no structured scheduling formula is used.  American Football Conference  = AFC East =  Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins  In the AFC East rivalry between the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins, the two teams have played 104 regular season and playoff games, with the Dolphins having a 61‚Äì48‚Äì1 advantage as of the end of the 2018 season. The intensity of the rivalry stems from the Dolphins winning 20 straight meetings in the 1970s, as well as the emergence of Hall- of-Fame quarterbacks Jim Kelly for Buffalo and Dan Marino for Miami in the 1980s and 1990s. The teams have also met four times in the NFL playoffs, with the Bills holding a 3‚Äì1 advantage, including a victory in the 1992 AFC Championship Game.  Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots  This is one of the more lopsided rivalries in the league, with the Patriots controlling the series throughout the Tom Brady Era. Prior to The Brady Era, Bills' Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly compiled a 12‚Äì8 career record against the Patriots. The Patriots lead 75‚Äì43‚Äì1 as of the end of the 2019 season. The Patriots won the teams' lone playoff meeting after the 1963 AFL season.  Buffalo Bills vs. New York Jets  This rivalry is not as fierce as other AFC East rivalries, as the two teams have rarely been competitive simultaneously. The rivalry briefly heated up when former Jets coach Rex Ryan was coaching for Buffalo from 2015 to 2016. The Bills lead series 62‚Äì55 as of the end of the 2018 season. The Bills won the rivals' lone post-season meeting in the 1981 AFC Wild Card round.  Miami Dolphins vs. New England Patriots  The Dolphins lead 55‚Äì53 as of the end of the 2019 season, but the Patriots lead the playoff series 2‚Äì1. The rivalry briefly heated up in 2005, when Patriots head coach Bill Belichick's former Browns assistant Nick Saban was hired as Dolphins head coach and when he nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees with the Dolphins, as well as in 2008 when the teams were battling for the top spot in the AFC East. These Dolphins won the division, making 2008 the only in a 16-year stretch in which New England did not win the AFC East. Both teams are also the only teams in the post-Merger era to post undefeated regular season records, with the Dolphins doing so in 1972 and the Patriots in 2007, but only the Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl. Recently, the Patriots have had the upper hand, posting a 26‚Äì13 record in the Tom Brady era.  Miami Dolphins vs. New York Jets  The Dolphins and Jets have often competed for divisional supremacy, and have played a number of classic games. This includes the game, known in NFL Lore as the Monday Night miracle where the Jets erased a 30‚Äì7 lead after three quarters and won the game in overtime; as well as the famous Dan Marino fake spike game. The Jets lead the series 54‚Äì53‚Äì1 as of the end of the 2019 season, while the Dolphins have won the only playoff meeting, the 1982 AFC Championship Game.Jerusha  New England Patriots vs. New York Jets  Games between the New England Patriots and New York Jets have often played out the fierce Yankees‚ÄìRed Sox rivalry in Major League Baseball, as New York City and Boston are approximately 3¬Ω hours apart by car. More recently, the Jets have tried to overcome the Patriots‚Äô domination in the division and the conference, facing them in the playoffs twice in a five-season span. The Patriots defeated the Jets 37‚Äì16 in the 2006 playoffs, while the Jets won 28‚Äì21 in the 2010 playoffs. The series is in New England's favor, 67‚Äì54‚Äì1 as of the end of the 2019 season series, including a playoff record of 2‚Äì1 against the Jets. = AFC North =  Baltimore Ravens vs. Cleveland Browns  The Browns‚ÄìRavens rivalry in the AFC North began when the Browns resumed operations 1999, after suspending operations for three seasons after the original Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens. The rivalry between the Browns and Ravens was more directed at former Browns owner Art Modell, who orchestrated the move, than the team itself, and has, by most Ravens fans, been simply considered a divisional game. The rivalry has been largely one- sided, as the Ravens hold a 31‚Äì11 series lead. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.  Baltimore Ravens vs. Pittsburgh Steelers  The Ravens- Steelers rivalry in the AFC North is one of the most intense in the NFL. The Ravens and Steelers often compete for divisional supremacy. They are also known for fielding tough, hard-hitting defensive squads, giving their games an extra element of physical intensity. The Steelers lead the series 28‚Äì24, including a 3‚Äì1 record in the playoffs. The two teams have combined for eight Super Bowl championships.  Cincinnati Bengals vs. Cleveland Browns  This rivalry, often referred to as the \\"Battle of Ohio\\" started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns. The colors of each team are similar, since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals original uniforms were identical to the Browns uniforms, excluding the word \\"Bengals\\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals. The Bengals lead the series 51‚Äì42 as of the end of the 2019 season. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.  Cincinnati Bengals vs. Pittsburgh Steelers  The two teams have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since 2000, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries. The Steelers lead the overall series 66‚Äì35 and the postseason series 2‚Äì0. However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28‚Äì7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger.  Cleveland Browns vs. Pittsburgh Steelers  The Browns‚ÄìSteelers rivalry is one of the most storied in the American Football Conference and NFL. With 128 meetings and counting, it is the oldest rivalry in the AFC. The two divisional foes have a natural rivalry due to the commonalities between the cities. It is sometimes called the Turnpike Rivalry because the majority of driving route between the two cities are connected via the Pennsylvania and Ohio Turnpike. The Steelers lead the series 76‚Äì59‚Äì1 as of the end of the 2019 season, including a 2‚Äì0 playoff record against Cleveland. The only time that the rivalry has met during the playoffs is during the Wild Card round of 2005. This is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer. The Steelers have dominated the series in recent years, posting a 36‚Äì7‚Äì1 record against the Browns since their 1999 return to the NFL. = AFC South =  Indianapolis Colts vs. Houston Texans  In one of the newer rivalries in the NFL, the Colts and Texans have intensified their animosity in recent years. Despite Indianapolis dominating the AFC South and this particular series under quarterback Peyton Manning in the 2000s, Houston has recently provided more competition, winning the division five times since 2011. Indianapolis currently leads the series 28‚Äì9, including a win in the postseason in 2018.  Houston Texans vs. Tennessee Titans  This rivalry matches the old team representing Houston (the Titans, as the Houston Oilers) against the new team (the Texans). Though the Titans dominated the series early on, the Texans have made it more competitive as of late. A notable moment involved Texans receiver Andre Johnson and Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan getting into a brawl during a 2010 matchup. The Titans lead the series 18‚Äì16, as of the end of the 2018 season.Houston Texans vs. Tennessee Titans Results The Football Database. Retrieved July 18, 2017. The two teams have never met in the playoffs.  Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Tennessee Titans  This is a relatively new rivalry as the Jaguars did not begin play until . A notable moment was the season, in which the Jaguars went 14‚Äì2, with both of their losses coming to the Titans. The Titans would beat the Jaguars for a third time in the AFC Championship Game, their only playoff meeting to date. This series was relatively quiet in recent years, as neither team has consistently contended for the postseason (the exception being in , when both teams qualified for the playoffs). The Titans lead series 29‚Äì21 as of the end of the 2019 season, including a 1‚Äì0 postseason record. A recent article suggested that this rivalry is one of the more boring ones in NFL franchise history. These two teams were once part of the AFC Central division in the late 90's. However, in 2002, the Titans and Jaguars became part of the AFC South. However, since the creation of this division, it has been overshadowed by the Colts and the Texans. Since 2002, the Texans have participated (and won) in their division three times. Indianapolis was participated (and won) 9 division titles since then. Neither the Titans or the Jaguars have won the division title since the early 2000s. In spite of all of this, both teams have been competitive since the beginning of their rivalry. Both teams had strong competition since the Titans went to Tennessee in 1999. There is hope that eventually this rivalry will become a storied success within its division. = AFC West =  Denver Broncos vs. Las Vegas Raiders  During the AFL days in the 1960s and up to 1976, the rivalry was very one-sided, with the Raiders going 26‚Äì6‚Äì2, including 14 straight wins from 1965‚Äì71. The Broncos defeated the Raiders in the AFC championship, en route to the first Super Bowl appearance. The Raiders won 13 out of 15 meetings from 1988‚Äì94, and held a 49‚Äì20‚Äì2 series lead by . However, the Broncos reversed their fortunes against the Raiders when Mike Shanahan became the Broncos' head coach in {y1995}}. Shanahan coached the Raiders in before being fired four games into the season, and later became involved in a lengthy contract dispute with Raiders' owner Al Davis. The Broncos went 21‚Äì7 against Oakland during the 14 seasons that Shanahan coached the Broncos (1995‚Äì2008). the Raiders lead the series 64‚Äì53‚Äì2 as of the end of the 2018 season. The teams have met twice in the playoffs, with each team winning one game.  Kansas City Chiefs vs. Las Vegas Raiders  The Chiefs‚ÄìRaiders rivalry is considered as one of the NFL's most bitter. Since the AFL was established in 1960, the Chiefs and Raiders have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger, the AFC West. The Chiefs lead the regular season series 67‚Äì53‚Äì2 as of the end of the 2019 season, including a 2‚Äì1 playoff record against Las Vegas.  Los Angeles Chargers vs. Las Vegas Raiders  The Chargers-Raiders rivalry dates to the 1963 season, when the Raiders defeated the heavily favored Chargers twice, both come-from-behind fourth quarter victories. One of the most memorable games between these teams was the \\"Holy Roller\\" game in 1978, in which the Raiders intentionally fumbled in order to score a touchdown. This somewhat controversial play resulted in a rule change the following season. On November 22, 1982, the Raiders hosted their first Monday Night football game in Los Angeles against the Chargers. The Chargers led the game in the 1st half 24‚Äì0 until the Raiders scored 28 unanswered points in the second half to win 28‚Äì24. The Raiders lead the series 63‚Äì54‚Äì2 as of the end of the 2018 season, including having won the only playoff game between the two teams, the 1980 AFC Championship game.  Denver Broncos vs. Kansas City Chiefs  Chiefs lead 63‚Äì55 as of the end of the 2017 season, but the Broncos won the only playoff game between the two teams, a 1997 AFC Divisional game.  Denver Broncos vs. Los Angeles Chargers  Broncos lead 67‚Äì52‚Äì1 as of the end of the 2019 season, including having won the only playoff meeting between the two teams, a 2013 AFC Divisional game.  Kansas City Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Chargers  Chiefs lead 61‚Äì56‚Äì1 as of the end of the 2018 season, but the Chargers won the only playoff meeting between the two teams, a 1992 AFC Wild Card game. = Conference rivalries =  Denver Broncos vs. New England Patriots  The Broncos lead 30‚Äì23 as of the end of the 2017 season, including a 4‚Äì1 playoff record against New England. In recent history, the Broncos and Patriots met in the postseason twice in three years, in both the 2013 and 2015 AFC Championship Games. The Broncos won both games, earning the right to represent the AFC in Super Bowls 48 and 50.  Indianapolis Colts vs. New England Patriots  The Colts‚ÄìPatriots rivalry is one of the NFL's most famous. The two teams combined for eight Super Bowl victories (six by the Patriots) and thirteen AFC Championships since , while both are noted for their organizational excellence. The Patriots lead 52‚Äì29 as of the end of the 2016 season, including a 4‚Äì1 playoff record against Indianapolis. The nature of this rivalry is somewhat ironic because while the Colts and Patriots were AFC East division rivals from 1970‚Äì2001 (dating back to the Colts' time in Baltimore), their intensified enmity wasn't prevalent until Indianapolis was moved into the newly formed AFC South following the 2001 season as part of the NFL's realignment. The two teams did not meet in 2002 but met every year from 2003‚Äì12. From the first game of the rivalry's renewal (a 38‚Äì34 Patriots victory highlighted by a last-second goalline stand) the rivalry has been bitterly close: following New England's 31‚Äì24 win in the Patriots lead the series with seven wins (two in the playoffs) versus five wins (one playoff) for the Colts, and the Patriots hold a slim lead in points scored, 319‚Äì305. The Colts and Patriots met every year from 2003‚Äì2015 as both teams often finished in the same position in their divisions. The other AFC East teams were only able to play the Colts when the East and South divisions were scheduled to play a full interlocking schedule. The modern match-up was often headlined as a contest between future Hall of Famers Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, who together have won six NFL MVP awards in eight years (2003‚Äì10; four by Manning). Tom Brady received his first start against the Colts after an injury to then-starter Drew Bledsoe, and proceeded to defeat the Colts in his first six games against them in the next years, including the 2003 AFC Championship game and a 2004 AFC Divisional playoff game. The Colts won the next 3 matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship Game on the way to their win in Super Bowl XLI. The Patriots' 2007 quest for a perfect season included a comeback 24‚Äì20 victory in their final visit to the RCA Dome. The Colts won the next two; in their 2009 Super Bowl season they won 35‚Äì34 following a 4th and 2 call by Bill Belichick. The 2010 match-up was Indy's first trip to Gillette Stadium since 2006; a last- minute Manning interception ended a 31‚Äì28 Patriots win. In 2011, the Patriots beat the Colts without Manning playing, 31‚Äì24. In 2012, the Patriots rudely welcomed Colts rookie quarterback Andrew Luck to the rivalry, returning two interceptions thrown by the first pick of the 2012 NFL Draft for touchdowns en route to a 59‚Äì24 blowout. The result was the same for the two teams in the 2013 AFC Divisional playoff game as New England cruised to a 43‚Äì22 victory. On November 16, 2014, at Lucas Oil Stadium, the New England defeated Indianapolis 42‚Äì20 behind 201 yards rushing from Jonas Gray, who also set a Patriots franchise record with four rushing touchdowns in the game. In the AFC Championship game for the 2014 NFL Season, the rivalry escalated again as the Patriots were accused of cheating by intentionally playing with under-inflated footballs, after beating the Colts 45‚Äì7. Dubbed Deflategate, the intense media scrutiny that followed blew up for a number of reasons, including the two-week lead up to Super Bowl XLIX and the \\"Spygate\\" scandal of 2007. There were also calls for the Patriots to be banned from Super Bowl XLIX, which the Patriots ended up winning over the Seattle Seahawks, 28‚Äì24. The ensuing investigation, including the Wells Report, went on to state that quarterback Tom Brady, \\"more probably than not, was at least generally aware\\" of using under inflated footballs in the game (Colts QB Andrew Luck also used under inflated footballs but was never investigated). The Patriots were fined 1 million dollars, and docked their 2016 1st round and 2017 4th round draft picks. Brady was given a 4-game suspension for the 2015 NFL season; the suspension was overturned for the 2015 season by Judge Richard Berman and Brady played the entirety of the season, including Week Six's match against the Colts. Brady served his suspension during the first four games of the 2016 season, after failing to appeal his suspension when it was reinstated in 2016. The Patriots won their most recent scheduled meeting on October 4, 2018, 38‚Äì24.  Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Tennessee Titans  The Steelers the all-time series 46‚Äì32 as of the end of the 2017 season.  Las Vegas Raiders vs. Pittsburgh Steelers   Baltimore Ravens vs. New England Patriots  This rivalry stems from 4 playoff matches played between the two in the early to mid 2010s. They met in back to back AFC Championships (2011 & 2012) along with two other playoff match ups in 2010 and 2015, the teams have split the playoff match ups 2‚Äì2, but the Patriots lead the regular season series 8‚Äì2 as of the end of the 2019 season.  National Football Conference  = NFC East =  Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Football Team  The rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Football Team, formerly known as the Redskins, is called one of the top NFL rivalries of all time and \\"one of the greatest in sports\\" by Sports Illustrated. The two franchises have won 37 combined division titles and ten NFL Championships, including eight combined Super Bowls. The rivalry started in when the Cowboys joined the league as an expansion team. During that year they were in separate conferences, but played once during the season. Since , Dallas has been in the same division as Washington. Dallas leads the all-time series 72‚Äì45‚Äì2 as of the end of the 2017 season. Despite their storied history they've only met twice in the playoffs (1972 & 1982), both times in the NFC Championship Game. Washington won both of those meetings. In 2009, they were the two wealthiest franchises in the NFL.  Dallas Cowboys vs. Philadelphia Eagles  The rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles has been one of the higher profile rivalries in the NFL over the past three decades, characterized by bitterly contested games that are typical of the NFC East, with both teams often contesting for the division crown. The Cowboys have a 69‚Äì53 edge in the all- time series as of the end of the 2019 season. In the playoffs the clubs have gone head to head four times, with the home team winning all four games and Dallas holding a 3‚Äì1 edge. The Eagles won in 1980, while the Cowboys won in 1992, 1995, & 2009\\\\.  Dallas Cowboys vs. New York Giants  The modern rivalry dates back to the 2003 season when Bill Parcells took over as Cowboys head coach. After he left, Wade Phillips coached the Cowboys to a division winning season in 2007 only to see the team fall to the eventual Super Bowl XLII champion Giants in the 2007 Divisional playoff game, in what proved to be the final playoff game in Texas Stadium history. Both teams combine for a total of nine Super Bowl Championships with the Giants winning the two most recent trophies. Dallas is ahead in the all-time series 68‚Äì46‚Äì2 as of the end of the 2019 season. The aforementioned 2007 playoff meeting was their only postseason encounter.  New York Giants vs. Philadelphia Eagles  The rivalry between the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants dates back to 1933. However, the competition began to heat up when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The rivalry is mainly based on the two teams being in the same division in the NFL since 1933 and the geographic New York City‚ÄìPhiladelphia rivalry. It is ranked by Sports Illustrated as amongst the top ten NFL rivalries of all-time at #4. However, the geographic rivalry between the Eagles and Giants is well known in football circles, meriting mention on ESPN.com. The rivalry is the second-oldest of the NFC East. It has been called the greatest rivalry in NFL history. The Giants and Eagles have met four times in the playoffs, with each team winning twice. The Giants won in 1981 & 2000, and the Eagles won in 2006 & 2008\\\\. The Eagles currently lead the all-time series 88‚Äì86‚Äì2 as of the 2019 season.  New York Giants vs. Washington Football Team  The Giants and Washington Football Team, formerly known as the Redskins, have a storied rivalry, as well as the oldest in the NFC East, dating back to 1932 with the founding of the Redskins' predecessors, the Boston Braves. While New York leads the rivalry, there have been great periods of competition between the two teams, most notably during the 1980s where they clashed for division titles and Super Bowl championships. Between 1982‚Äì91 they combined for 8 division titles and 5 Super Bowl titles, two by the Giants (1986, 1990) and three by the Redskins (1982, 1987, 1991). New York has a 103‚Äì69‚Äì4 all-time record over Washington as of the end of the 2019 season. The Giants are the second team to mark 100 wins against another NFL franchise in 2017. (The Green Bay Packers were the first team to do so against the Lions in 2016.) The teams have met in the playoffs twice, with the Redskins shutting out the Giants 28‚Äì0 in 1943 and New York returning the favor 43 years later in the 1986 NFC Conference Championship, winning 17‚Äì0.  Washington Football Team vs. Philadelphia Eagles  Washington leads the all-time series 86‚Äì79‚Äì6 as of the end of the 2019 season and won their only playoff matchup in the 1990 Wild Card round 20‚Äì6. = NFC North =  Chicago Bears vs. Green Bay Packers  The Bears‚ÄìPackers rivalry began in and is the league's longest. The Packers lead the series 98‚Äì95‚Äì6 as of September 5, 2019. The two clubs have won a combined 22 NFL championships (including 5 Super Bowls) and have 48 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The strike-shortened 1982 NFL season wiped out both Bears-Packers meetings scheduled for that season. Because of this, it is not the longest continuous rivalry. That goes to the Lions-Packers, who have played at least twice each season since 1932. The rivalry has led to the Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee/Wisconsin rivalry being seen in other sports, like the Brewers‚ÄìCubs rivalry in Major League Baseball and the rivalry between the Bulls and Bucks in the National Basketball Association. The teams met four times in the 2011 calendar year, and the Packers won all four. They met on January 2 in the 2010 regular season finale, then three weeks later in the NFC Conference Championship Game en route to winning Super Bowl XLV, and then they had both meetings in the 2011 regular season. The 2013 regular season finale served as a playoff game for the NFC North Division Championship, which Green Bay won 33‚Äì28, scoring a 48-yard touchdown on fourth-and-8 with 38 seconds left.  Chicago Bears vs. Detroit Lions  The Bears‚ÄìLions rivalry is an NFL rivalry between the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions. Chicago and Detroit share or have shared a sports rivalry in all four major sports (see; Bulls‚ÄìPistons rivalry, Tigers‚ÄìWhite Sox rivalry, and Blackhawks‚ÄìRed Wings rivalry). The franchises first met in 1930 when the Lions were known as the Portsmouth Spartans and based in Portsmouth, Ohio. They moved to Detroit for the 1934 season. The Bears and Lions have been division rivals since 1933 and have usually met twice a season since the Lions franchise began. The Bears lead the series 101‚Äì74‚Äì5 as of the end of the 2019 season. This rivalry is also the longest-running annual series in the NFL as both teams have met at least once a season since 1930. (As mentioned above, due to the 1982 strike, both games scheduled for the Bears‚ÄìPackers rivalry were not played that season.) However, one of the two meetings between both teams was canceled during Week 3 of the 1987 season, which does not make this rivalry the longest-running continuous series in the NFL (that feat belongs to the Lions‚ÄìPackers rivalry, who have met at least twice a season since 1932 without any canceled meetings).  Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings  It began when the Vikings entered the league as an expansion team in 1961. The first time these two teams met, the Vikings stunned the Bears 37‚Äì13 in Minnesota. Both teams are members of the NFC North, and play at least twice a year. The rivalry is known for having had many offensive-oriented contests, and also several surprising results. The Vikings lead the overall series 60‚Äì56‚Äì2. The teams have met once in the postseason, a 35‚Äì18 Bears win in the 1994 Wild Card Round.  Detroit Lions vs. Green Bay Packers  The Lions‚ÄìPackers rivalry is an NFL rivalry between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers. They first met in 1930 when the Lions were known as the Portsmouth Spartans and based in Portsmouth, Ohio. The team eventually moved to Detroit for the 1934 season. The Lions and Packers have been division rivals since 1933 and have always met at least twice a season since 1932, without any canceled games between both rivals (as of today). The Packers lead the series 101‚Äì72‚Äì7 as of the end of the 2019 season.  Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings  The Lions and Vikings have played twice annually since the Vikings entered the league's Western Conference in 1961. The two teams moved to the NFC Central after the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, which became the NFC North after the NFL's 2002 realignment. This is the only NFC North rivalry without any head-to-head postseason meetings.  Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings  The Packers‚ÄìVikings rivalry began in 1961, when the Vikings entered the league as an expansion team. The rivalry is known for being very close, both in the all- time series and in each game. It is also considered to be one of the most intense rivalries in the NFL, due these close games, the fact that both teams have often fought for the NFC North title, and the fact that the two states in which these teams reside (Minnesota and Wisconsin) have a rivalry in many sports, seen between the Big Ten rivals, the University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota. Events such as Randy Moss mooning the Green Bay crowd in the first playoff game between these two teams (won by the Vikings), and former Packer great Brett Favre's move to the Vikings have created more resentment between these teams. = NFC South =  Atlanta Falcons vs. New Orleans Saints  At 100 games played, the series between the Falcons and Saints in the NFC South is the oldest and most established rivalry in the division. Born one year apart, the Saints and Falcons were the first two NFL franchises in the Deep South (Dallas being arguably southern but not in the traditional Deep South). They have shared many of the same players, such as Morten Andersen (the leading scorer in Saints History, as Falcons Kicker Matt Bryant is now the leading scorer in Falcons history ), Bobby Hebert (who quarterbacked for both teams in the 1990s), and Joe Horn (the Pro Bowl Saints receiver who left for the Falcons in 2007). They have also drawn coaches from the same families, and even shared a head coach: recent Falcons coach Jim L. Mora is the son of longtime Saints coach Jim E. Mora, and former Falcons and Saints coach Wade Phillips is the son of former Saints coach Bum Phillips. Although rarely noted by the national media‚Äîno doubt due to both teams' long stretches of futility until the opening decade of the 21st century‚Äîgames between the Falcons and Saints have riveted their respective regions for more than 40 years. Fans of both teams consider the other their most important and hated opponent. ESPN.com writer Len Pasquarelli has cited the rivalry as one of the best in all of sports: \\"Every year, bus caravans loaded with rowdy (and usually very inebriated) fans make the seven-hour trip between the two cities. Unless you've attended a Falcons-Saints debauchery-filled afternoon, you'll just have to take my word for how much fun it really can be.\\"[23] Atlanta leads the series 50‚Äì46 (49‚Äì46 regular season, 1‚Äì0 playoffs). From 2006 onward, the teams have become consistent playoff threats, New Orleans appropriated five division titles in 2006, 2009, 2011, 2017, and 2018 while the Falcons made the playoffs in 2008 and captured the division in 2010, 2012 and 2016. Both teams have reached the Super Bowl, only once New Orleans and twice Atlanta (the Saints won Super Bowl XLIV over the Colts 31‚Äì17, while Atlanta lost Super Bowl XXXIII to the Broncos 34‚Äì19 and Super Bowl LI to the Patriots 34‚Äì28).  New Orleans Saints vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers  Although the Saints and the Buccaneers have played since 1977, this matchup began a full- fledged rivalry in 2002 when the Saints and the Buccaneers moved into the same division, the NFC South. The first matchup was in 1977 at the Louisiana Superdome (now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome) when the Bucs won 33‚Äì14. The most recent match was in 2019 at Mercedes-Benz Superdome. The Saints won 31‚Äì24. Together, they have had 55 meetings. The Saints lead this rivalry 34‚Äì21.  Carolina Panthers vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers  Although the Buccaneers and the Panthers have played since 1995, this match-up became a full-fledged rivalry in 2002 when they moved into the same division, the NFC South. This first meeting came in 1995 at Memorial Stadium in Clemson when the Bucs won 20‚Äì13. The last meeting came in 2019 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London when the Panthers won 37‚Äì26. The Panthers lead the series 24‚Äì15.  Atlanta Falcons vs. Carolina Panthers  The Falcons‚ÄìPanthers rivalry is a rivalry between the Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers of the National Football League. Both franchises have a combined twelve divisional titles (eleven as members of the same division) and four Super Bowl appearances, with the Falcons appearing in Super Bowl XXXIII and Super Bowl LI and the Panthers appearing in Super Bowls XXXVIII and 50. The Panthers and Falcons have played each other twice a year since 1995, as members of both the NFC West (1995‚Äì2001) and NFC South (2002‚Äìpresent) divisions. Their games have been marked by intensity, close scores, and remarkable performances. It is also known as the I-85 Rivalry due to Atlanta and Charlotte being only four hours apart on Interstate 85. Indeed, games between the two often feature large contingents of the away team's fans visiting the stadium. Atlanta leads the rivalry 30‚Äì18. = NFC West =  San Francisco 49ers vs. Seattle Seahawks  The Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers became divisional rivals in 2002, when Seattle moved to the NFC West. However, it was not until 2011 that the match-up became a true rivalry. The 49ers won the division in 2002, but did not have another winning season until 2011. Meanwhile, the Seahawks made the playoffs five straight times from 2003‚Äì2007 and appeared in Super Bowl XL. In 2010, the Seahawks hired former USC head coach Pete Carroll, who took the Seahawks to the playoffs in his first year, and the rivalry started growing in 2011 when the 49ers hired former Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh, who also took his team to the playoffs in his first year. Carroll and Harbaugh had been intense rivals as college head coaches, and the rivalry followed them into the NFL. The rivalry took off in 2012, when the two teams posted winning records and made the NFC playoffs during the same year for the first time. The teams split their games, with the Seahawks defeating the 49ers 42‚Äì13 on national TV in a week 16 game that kept the division race alive until the final week. San Francisco ultimately won the division by a half-game and advanced to Super Bowl XLVII (losing 34‚Äì31 to the Baltimore Ravens), while the Seahawks lost in the NFC divisional round. In 2013, the teams again split their games, and the Seahawks won the division by a game and went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII, defeating the 49ers in the NFC Championship game. All three 49ers-Seahawks games were highly anticipated that season, and most sports analysts called it the best rivalry in the NFL. Ever since then the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks fans are always eagerly awaiting this divisional round matchup. After several years of mediocre or poor teams, the 49ers regained relevance in the 2019 season. They were the last undefeated team in the league at 8‚Äì0. On Monday Night Football, they played a pitched battle where San Francisco missed what would have been a game-winning field goal in overtime. They proceeded to lose their first game of the season when Seattle kicked a field goal on the last play of the game. The rematch between the division foes was the final game of the NFL season, with the division championship (and playoff seeding) on the line. The Niners won this time, earning the top seed in the NFC. Seattle leads the series 25‚Äì16.  San Francisco 49ers vs. Los Angeles Rams  The rivalry between the 49ers and Rams began in 1950. The rivalry became one of the most intense in the NFL in the 1970s as the two California-based teams (the Rams then played their home games in Los Angeles whereas the 49ers played their home games in San Francisco) regularly competed for the NFL's NFC West Division title. The two teams have contested 141 games, in which San Francisco leads 71‚Äì67‚Äì3. After the Rams relocated to St. Louis (in 1995), the rivalry had lost its geographical lore, although games were still intense. The cultural differences between the West Coast (where the 49ers are based) and the Midwest (where the Rams were based) also added to the intensity of the rivalry. In 2016, the Rams moved back to Los Angeles making the rivalry once again West Coast based. Sports Illustrated considers it the 8th best of all time in the NFL. = Conference rivalries =  Dallas Cowboys vs. Green Bay Packers  The Packers lead the all-time series 19‚Äì17.  Dallas Cowboys vs. San Francisco 49ers  The bitter rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers began in the 1970s and became prominent during the 1990s. For three straight seasons from 1992 through 1994 the two teams met in the conference championship game. Each was a hotly contested battle whose winner went on to win the Super Bowl in every one of those seasons. The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in the history of the NFL. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games with the Cowboys leading the postseason series 5‚Äì2. The Cowboys lead all-time series 18‚Äì17‚Äì1.  Green Bay Packers vs. Seattle Seahawks  As of January 2020, Packers are 12‚Äì3 vs. Seahawks including 4‚Äì0 in playoffs at Green Bay and 14‚Äì9 overall including 4‚Äì1 in playoffs.  Historical rivalries  = Las Vegas Raiders vs. Pittsburgh Steelers = The Immaculate Reception spawned a heated rivalry between the Raiders and Steelers, a rivalry that was at its peak during the 1970s, when both teams were among the best in the league and both were known for their hard-hitting, physical play. The teams met in the playoffs in each of the next four seasons, starting with the Raiders' 33‚Äì14 victory in the 1973 divisional playoffs. Pittsburgh used the AFC championship game victories over Oakland (24‚Äì13 at Oakland in 1974 and 16‚Äì10 at Pittsburgh in 1975) as a springboard to victories in Super Bowl IX and Super Bowl X, before the Raiders notched a 24‚Äì7 victory at home in 1976 on their way to winning Super Bowl XI. To date, the two last met in the playoffs in 1983 when the eventual Super Bowl champion Raiders, playing in Los Angeles at the time, crushed the Steelers 38‚Äì10. The rivalry has somewhat died off in the years since, mainly due to the Raiders on-field struggles since appearing in Super Bowl XXXVII. = Dallas Cowboys vs. San Francisco 49ers = The bitter rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers began in the 1970s and became prominent during the 1990s. For three straight seasons from 1992 through 1994 the two teams met in the conference championship game. Each was a hotly contested battle whose winner went on to win the Super Bowl in every one of those seasons. The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in the history of the NFL. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games with the Cowboys leading the postseason series 5‚Äì2. The Cowboys lead all-time series 18‚Äì17‚Äì1. = New York Giants vs. San Francisco 49ers = The Giants-49ers rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise and would combine to win six Super Bowls from 1981‚Äì90. During that stretch there were five postseason meetings between the two teams. The 49ers defeated the Giants in the first two meetings (the 1981 NFC divisional round 38‚Äì24 and again in the divisional round, this time in 1984, winning 21‚Äì10) en route to victories in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XIX. The Giants would defeat the 49ers in the next three playoff meetings; in the 1985 Wild Card round the Giants defeated the defending Super Bowl XIX champions 17‚Äì3, then crushed the 49ers 49‚Äì3 in the divisional round of the 1986 playoffs en route to winning Super Bowl XXI, the first in the history of the Giants franchise. This game is memorable for nose tackle Jim Burt's hit on Joe Montana that knocked him out of the game in the second quarter; Montana's pass on this play was intercepted by Lawrence Taylor and Taylor ran in a 34-yard touchdown. The two teams met again in the 1990 NFC Conference Championship Game. In one of the most physical football games ever played, the Giants upset the 49ers 15‚Äì13, ending their hopes of winning three Super Bowls in a row while the Giants went on to win their second Super Bowl in franchise history in Super Bowl XXV. The 49ers got their revenge in the 1993 playoffs when they defeated the Giants in the divisional round 44‚Äì3 in the last game of Lawrence Taylor's and Phil Simms' careers. The rivalry intensified again in the 2002 playoffs when the two clubs met in the NFC Wild Card playoff round and the 49ers behind Jeff Garcia erased a 38‚Äì14 gap for a 39‚Äì38 49ers win, a game decided on a chaotic and controversial botched field goal attempt by the Giants. Recently, the rivalry has cooled down from its peak in the 1980s. However, during the 2011 NFC Championship Game the two met at Candlestick Park. The Giants defeated the 49ers 20‚Äì17 in overtime to go to and eventually win Super Bowl XLVI. = Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Dallas Cowboys = The Cowboys lead the all-time series 17‚Äì15, but the Steelers are 2‚Äì1 against the Cowboys in the Super Bowl. = Dallas Cowboys vs Green Bay Packers = The Packers lead the all-time series 19‚Äì17. = San Francisco 49ers vs. Las Vegas Raiders =  Instate rivalries  = New York Giants vs. New York Jets = The Giants lead the all-time series 8‚Äì6. = Miami Dolphins vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers = The Buccaneers lead the all-time series 6‚Äì5. = Dallas Cowboys vs. Houston Texans/Houston Oilers/Dallas Texans = The Cowboys lead their series with the Texans 7‚Äì6 and won their series with the Oilers 18‚Äì13. = Kansas City Chiefs vs. St. Louis Cardinals/St. Louis Rams = = Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Philadelphia Eagles = The Eagles lead the all-time series 48‚Äì28‚Äì3. = San Francisco 49ers vs. Los Angeles Rams= :See above  See also  * Major League Baseball rivalries * Major League Soccer rivalries * National Basketball Association rivalries * National Hockey League rivalries  References   External links  * Sports Illustrated ‚Äì Top 10 NFL Rivalries Of All Time * Sports Illustrated ‚Äì Top 10 New NFL Rivalries * Dallas Cowboys Rivals ‚Äì Bitter Dallas Cowboys Rivals of NFL History Rivalries Category:History of the National Football League ","title":"National Football League rivalries"},{"id":"23906321","text":"The Up and Coming Stakes is an Australian Turf Club Group 3 Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-old colts and geldings, run as a quality handicap over a distance of 1300 metres at Randwick Racecourse, Sydney, Australia in August.

Eight people were killed when a minivan being driven by 36-year-old Diane Schuler traveled 1.7 miles in the wrong direction on the parkway and collided head-on with an oncoming SUV. Schuler, her daughter and three nieces, and the three passengers in the oncoming SUV were killed. The crash was the worst fatal motor vehicle accident to occur in Westchester County since July 22, 1934, when a bus accident in Ossining claimed 20 lives.Ali, A., \\"4 Kids, 4 Adults Die on Taconic,\\" The Journal News (Lower Hudson), July 26, 2009. The ensuing investigation into the crash's cause received nationwide attention. Toxicology tests conducted by the medical examiner revealed that Schuler was heavily intoxicated with both alcohol and marijuana at the time of the crash. Schuler's husband, Daniel, has consistently denied that she used drugs or alcohol \\"excessively\\", and has made multiple national media appearances to defend his late wife and call for further investigation into other possible medical causes for her erratic driving. An independent investigator hired by the Schuler family obtained DNA testing and toxicology testing of Schuler's samples, and also confirmed the results of the original testing. Day of incident 2003 Ford Windstar At approximately on Sunday, July 26, 2009, 36-year-old Diane Schuler left the Hunter Lake Campground in Parksville, New York, in a red 2003 Ford Windstar that belonged to her brother. Riding with Schuler were her 5-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter, and her brother's three daughters (ages 8, 7, and 5). Her husband, Daniel Schuler, left the campground at the same time in a separate vehicle since he had a pickup truck and took the dog with him.\\"Crash Mom Was Fully 'Loaded'\\", New York Post, August 5, 2009.NY Police: Woman Was OK at Restaurant Before Crash , WCBS, Aug 7, 2009.Fitz-Gibbon J, Bandler J., \\"A Week after the Crash, Questions Remain,\\" The Journal News (Lower Hudson), August 3, 2009.

On the way to their home in West Babylon, Schuler stopped at a McDonald's fast- food restaurant and a Sunoco gas station in Liberty. While at the gas station, on surveillance video with no sound, it was reported that she attempted to buy over-the-counter pain-relief medication, possibly for a painful tooth although there has never been any evidence to support this, but the gas station did not sell any.\\"Private Eye: Wrong-Way Driver Stopped at NY Store,\\" Associated Press, August 14, 2009.Lam, C., Schuler's husband meets again with State Police, New York Newsday, August 14, 2009. Schuler left Liberty just after , traveling along Route 17/Interstate 86 and the New York Thruway (Interstate 87), entering the Ramapo-Sloatsburg service area, and crossing the Tappan Zee Bridge, heading east. Several witnesses later reported seeing a red minivan driving aggressively on Route 17/Interstate 86 and Interstate 87, including aggressively tailgating, flashing headlights, honking the horn, moving in and out of lanes, and straddling two lanes. At , Schuler called Warren Hance, her brother and father of her three nieces, from the van. She reportedly told him that they were being delayed by traffic.Baker, A., and Kovaleski, S., \\"Alcohol and Phone-Call Details in Wrong-Way Crash,\\" The New York Times, August 8, 2009. According to a police report, Schuler was seen by witnesses at approximately by the side of the road with her hands on her knees, as if vomiting; she was seen again in the same position a short time later, north of the Ramapo-Sloatsburg rest stop.Crowley, Kieran. \\"Taconic ma twice car sick.\\" New York Post, 2009-11-09. 2004 Chevrolet TrailBlazer At about , another call was made to Hance from Schuler's cell phone. During this call, one of Schuler's nieces reportedly told her father that Schuler was having trouble seeing and speaking clearly. Schuler herself then talked to Hance and said that she was disoriented and could not see clearly. Police believe that the car was stopped in a pull-off area beyond the Tappan Zee Bridge tollbooths for at least part of this call. Hance reportedly told Schuler to stay off the road while he came to meet them; follow-up calls from Hance to Schuler were not answered. For some reason, she left her cell phone on the highway; it was found by another motorist by the side of the road near the tollbooth.Cohen S, and Bandler J, \\"Driver Spoke on Phone with Brother 25 Minutes Before Fatal Crash ,\\" The Journal News (Lower Hudson), July 30, 2009.Baker, A., \\"Investigators Reconstruct a Route That Led to 8 Deaths,\\" The New York Times, August 2, 2009.

Within the next minute, four more 911 calls were placed by motorists who reported that a car was traveling the wrong way down the parkway going approximately . Chevrolet Tracker The van traveled south for in the parkway's northbound passing lane before colliding head-on, at approximately , with a 2004 Chevrolet TrailBlazer, which then struck a 2002 Chevrolet Tracker. At the time of impact, Schuler was traveling approximately 85 mph. Schuler, her daughter, and two of her nieces were dead at the scene of the crash (the children did not appear to have been in car seats, or even to have had seatbelts fastened), along with the three men in the TrailBlazer: 81-year-old Michael Bastardi, his 49-year-old son Guy, and their friend, 74-year-old Dan Longo. The two occupants of the Tracker suffered only minor injuries. Schuler's severely injured third niece and Schuler's 5-year-old son Bryan were taken to area hospitals, where the niece died later that day.Gorman, S., \\"Child's Helpless Eyes Haunt Ossining Firefighter ,\\" The Journal News (Lower Hudson), August 10, 2009.

Two men who witnessed the accident and smoke rising out of the van ran to assist the occupants. After removing Schuler from the van, the two men saw a large, broken Absolut Vodka bottle by the driver's side. The men tried to pull the girls out of the van, and noted that they had no pulse. Because the children possibly were not seat belted in and thrown together, the men did not even notice Bryan stuck under another child. Bryan was the only survivor of the accident.  Intoxication levels  The investigation of the collision drew nationwide attention, as Schuler's husband strongly disagreed with the conclusion that she was heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash. A toxicology report released on August 4 by Westchester County medical examiners found that Schuler had a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.19%, with approximately six grams of alcohol in her stomach that had not yet been absorbed into her blood.Ferran, Lee. \\"Diane Schuler, Wrong-Way Highway Driver Who Killed 8, Had 10 Drinks, Was High.\\" ABC News, 2009-08-04.

In an August 8 press conference, Daniel Schuler and his attorney Dominic Barbara initially denied that Diane did drugs or was drinking that weekend at the lake since several children were with them.

In November, it was reported that Schuler's sister-in-law had made a statement to police that she actually smoked marijuana on a regular basis. Daniel and Barbara believed that Schuler drove erratically due to a medical issue, such as a stroke. According to Barbara, Schuler was obese for much of her life and suffered from diabetes, although additional sources cite Schuler as only having had gestational diabetes, a temporary condition related to a prior pregnancy, rather than a chronic condition. Barbara has also mentioned an abscess that had persisted in her mouth for seven weeks before her death, and a lump in her leg, about which he said, \\"[It] might have been an embolism\\". The results of an autopsy conducted by a Westchester County medical examiner one day after the accident found that Schuler had not suffered a stroke, aneurysm, or heart attack.Amon, Michael. \\"Authorities: Autopsy Offers No Explanation for Crash.\\" Newsday, 2009-07-28. In September, New York's top forensic pathologist said that a hair test should have been done to determine Schuler's drug history. Daniel and Barbara announced plans to exhume the body to perform the hair test and other examinations; experts said that this was unlikely to produce any new information since tests from two separate labs came up with exactly the same conclusion. Daniel also intended to re-test the fluid samples taken during the autopsy. The Westchester County medical examiner's office, which performed the autopsy, said that the degradation of the fluids over time was likely to result in lowered alcohol and THC readings; however, several toxicology experts said that the results should be similar to the previous test if the fluid samples had been properly stored. On November 7, Ruskin announced that the Schuler family had raised the money to retest Schuler's tissue samples and that the retesting would take place soon. In July 2010, it was reported that Daniel had accepted a $100,000 offer from a film company, Moxie Firecracker Films, to record his wife's exhumation for an HBO documentary. The money would reportedly be placed in trust for Bryan.Lysiak, Matthew, et al. \\"Families Fight over Planned HBO Film of Taconic Death Driver Diane Schuler on Anniversary of Tragedy.\\" New York Daily News, 2010-07-27.

When Daniel appeared on CNN's Larry King Live to demand more testing of his wife's remains, Longo's brother Joseph issued a statement saying in part, \\"I want Daniel Schuler to know that he keeps inflicting more pain on all concerned once again [by] going to the media to try [to] paint a picture of a perfect wife and mother.\\" Bastardi's daughters appeared with their lawyer on NBC's Today, during which they questioned Daniel's culpability in enabling his wife's substance abuse and called for him to undergo drug testing himself. \\"It makes me angry that he keeps denying it,\\" said Margaret Nicotina, Bastardi's daughter. \\"Every time he does it, he brings it back for us. I just wish that he would just admit that she was drunk. Maybe if he knows what happened that morning, if they argued or anything, that would be the truth. He wants the truth. So do we.\\" Their lawyer called Daniel's position totally outrageous, an insult to the intelligence of the American public, and a hoax. Ruskin said on The Oprah Winfrey Show in October 2009 that Daniel had avoided media appearances since Larry King Live out of respect to the Bastardi family. In June 2010, the New York State Police issued its final report on the accident following eleven months of analysis. The report upheld the previous toxicology findings that Schuler was highly intoxicated and had high levels of THC in her system at the time of the accident.Ferrete, Candice. \\"Taconic Tragedy: Schuler Was Going 85 MPH in Wrong Direction, Final Police Report Says.\\" The Journal News (Lower Hudson), 2010-06-29. Legal action According to a Westchester County medical examiner, the crash was ruled a homicide soon after it occurred, because the victims were killed due to Schuler's negligent driving, regardless of toxicology findings. On August 18, Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore said that no charges would be filed in the incident, because Schuler was the only person responsible for the deaths. \\"Diane Schuler died in the crash and the charges died with her,\\" DiFiore said.\\"No Charges in Fatal Wrong- way Crash.\\" CBS News, 2009-08-18. In October 2009, DiFiore faced accusations from both Dan Schorr (a Republican challenger for her office) and a Bastardi family attorney that she had mishandled the Schuler case by neglecting to initiate a grand jury investigation into the crash. In response to Schorr's comments, DiFiore responded, \\"Is he suggesting that there was criminal evidence of a crime committed by someone and we wouldn't pursue it?

On December 10, the Bastardi family filed suit against Diane Schuler and her brother, Warren Hance, seeking unspecified damages for wanton, willful, and reckless conduct. According to the family's lawyers, they were required by state law to include Hance in the suit because he was the owner of the van.Zraick, Karen. \\"Suit Filed in Wrong-Way Crash That Killed 8 on Taconic.\\" The New York Times, 2009-12-10. In July 2011, Jackie Hance, who lost her three daughters in the accident, filed suit against her brother-in- law, Daniel Schuler. The suit claimed that the three deceased Hance girls suffered terror, fear of impending death, extreme horror, fright, and mental anguish. On July 26, 2011, the day after the premiere of HBO's documentary There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane, and on the second anniversary of the crash, Daniel sued the state for not \\"keeping the road safe\\" and his brother- in-law Warren Hance as the owner of the minivan that Diane was driving. By July 2014, all lawsuits by all parties were either settled or dropped. The judge sealed all the settlements.

There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane, directed by Liz Garbus for HBO Documentaries, establishes a timeline of events prior to the accident. The documentary suggests that Schuler could have been suffering from severe pain caused by a tooth abscess during the drive home, causing her to look for painkillers at the gas station and, upon failing to find any, self-medicating with drugs and alcohol. The pain of the abscess, combined with vodka and marijuana, could have put her in a temporary state of delirium that triggered her fatal behavior.HBO, There's something wrong with Aunt Diane - Interview with Liz Garbus In the documentary, Daniel and Barbara claim they gave Ruskin $30,000 to conduct an independent investigation and to re-test samples. Throughout the documentary, Daniel and Jay Schuler, Diane's sister-in-law, claim that Ruskin was not returning their phone calls for nine months. At the end of the documentary, Ruskin states that he had called her months ago with the results, and that she refused to pick up her phone. She is seen claiming that \\"she was told not to pick up\\" and \\"that she didn't understand any of it.\\" Ruskin then informs her that his tests corroborated the previous tests; that Schuler was highly intoxicated from alcohol and marijuana. Schuler's family persisted in refusing to accept the test results. Jackie Hance wrote a book called I'll See You Again in which the tragedy is revisited, focusing on her initial grief and later reemergence into life.Time - Health & Family, I'll see you again, Alexandra Sifferlin, May 12, 2013. Stephen King's short story \\"Herman Wouk is Still Alive\\" in Bazaar of Bad Dreams (2015) is, according to King, a fictional attempt to find answers to questions about what led to the crash and \\"perhaps to obtain some sort of closure.\\" The Hance Family Foundation Jackie and Warren Hance formed a foundation, the Hance Family Foundation, whose main purpose is to honor the lives of their three daughters by ensuring healthy, happy, and safe children through innovative self-esteem educational programming. The foundation's central project is Beautiful Me, a self-esteem program designed to educate girls by promoting appreciation for their genuine qualities, accurate self- awareness, and the satisfaction of helping others.
