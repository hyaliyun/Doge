Born in Charleston, South Carolina, he currently lives and works in New York City.  Industrial Scars  Through large-scale aerial photo shoots and accompanying documentary research, Fair's Industrial Scars project explores the detritus of our consumer society. Industrial Scars subjects range from oil drilling and coal ash waste to large-scale agricultural production and abandoned mining operations. In small airplanes, he circles above industrial areas and photographs with a bird's eye perspective the effects these operations have on our environment. Topics of particular interest include the global warming process, environmental pollution, and habitat destruction‚Äîall of which are illustrated in Fair's photographs. With his photos, Fair has called attention to environmental and political problems in different regions of the world. Fair has had touring photography exhibits in the USA, Europe, and Asia. Additionally, he travels around the world, giving environmental symposia to teach audiences about consumer responsibility and environmental awareness. Fair's work has been published in The New York Times and magazines National Geographic, Vanity Fair, TIME, and New York and featured on European Television networks like Arte, and TTT, and American programs likeToday and Marketplace, television and radio, respectively. Fair's second book, \\"Industrial Scars: The Hidden Costs of Consumption\\" published by Papadakis, brings our attentions to the tragic effects created by human impact on our planet. At first, his photographs are mesmerisingly beautiful: taken at bird's eye perspective from a small plane, their shapes, colours and details give them an aesthetic quality that entrance and capture the imagination, yet concern and horror creep in on the realisation of the true reality of the subject.

The WCC promotes wolf conservation by teaching about wolves, their relationship to the environment, and the human role in protecting their future. To accomplish its mission, WCC holds regular educational programs to discuss wolf conservation, supports wolf reintroduction in federally designated areas that can sustain viable wolf populations, and provides a natural habitat for a few captive wolves where observation of natural behavior is possible. WCC is the preeminent facility in the eastern United States for the captive breeding and pre-release of endangered wolf species.

Plot Rebecca \\"Becca\\" and Howard \\"Howie\\" Corbett's four-year-old son Danny is killed in a car accident after he runs out into the street after his dog. Eight months on, Becca wants to give away Danny's clothes, remove Danny's things, and sell their house. Howie is angry at Becca's elimination of anything that reminds them of their child. Becca assumes Howie wants to have another child, but she refuses. Becca's mother, Nat, has also lost a son, Arthur (Becca's brother), who died of a drug overdose in his 30s. Becca states the two deaths are different situations, and thus not comparable. Becca's sister Izzy is pregnant, and Becca keeps giving Izzy passive-aggressive advice about becoming a mother, which Izzy resents. Becca and Howie attend group therapy, where Becca is irritated by some of the other members ‚Äì particularly by one couple who attribute their own child's death to 'God's will'. Becca stops going to group, while Howie continues to attend the meetings without Becca. Meanwhile, long-time member Gabby starts coming to group alone, telling Howie that her husband also refuses to come to group therapy. One night before group he sees her high in her car, and asks to join her. They both start smoking pot in her car before the group therapy meetings. Eventually, they ditch meetings in favour of going to do things like bowling, where they almost begin an affair. However, Howie pulls away, stating that he is in love with his wife. Meanwhile, Becca starts meeting with Jason, the teenage driver of the car that hit Danny. She discovers he feels guilty and tells him she does not blame him for the accident. Jason tells her about a comic book he is writing called Rabbit Hole, which is about parallel universes. She asks to see it, and he tells her that she can see it when he is finished. Becca and Howie put their house on the market. The day of the open house, Howie decides to stay at the home for it. During the open house, he is in Danny's bedroom with an interested couple, who ask about his son. He tells them that his son died and they react awkwardly. After the open house, Jason brings his finished comic book to Becca and walks in unannounced through the door, which is still open from the open house. As Jason gives Becca the book, Howie realises who he is and gets angry. Becca tells Howie she has been meeting Jason. Howie is angered by this and demands that Jason leave immediately. Jason complies. Becca and Jason meet again, and talk about the content of the comic book ‚Äì parallel lives. She realises that at this moment, she is living her 'sad' self. There are many other versions of her that exists in other ways, and are not consumed by grief. Howie and Becca begin to have new activities, such as bowling and playing games, and they start to accept their son's death. Becca also comes to realize that her grief is like her own mother's, in that it will never stop. Howie and Becca decide to have a garden lunch. The scene begins with Howie telling Becca how the lunch would take place, subtly and incrementally interacting with a small group of trusted friends while life begins to feel normal again. Simultaneously, the screen fades into the lunch as Howie continues to speak in the background. The film ends with Becca and Howie sitting in their garden alone, after all their guests have left, staring into space. Becca reaches out to Howie and touches his hand.

Differences from the play The play has a cast of five roles, while a few other characters such as Gabby are only mentioned in dialogue. In contrast, the film has a cast of over a dozen actors. While the entire play takes place in the home of Becca and Howie, the film has a variety of locations. Past incidents, such as Becca's bad experience in the grief support group, are referred to in the play's dialogue but are depicted on screen in the film. The videos that Howie obsesses over are actually seen in the film, though not in the play. The two subplots of Howie's relationship with a woman from the grief support group and Becca's relationship with Jason, the driver of the car that hit Danny, have both been expanded. The film also adds new characters who do not appear in the play: sister Izzy's boyfriend and Howie's best friend. Jason is an aspiring science fiction story writer in the play, but an aspiring comic book artist in the film. In the opinion of critic Jim Lane, the film is more focused on the husband and wife and less of an ensemble piece. Lane writes > On stage, Rabbit Hole is a tightly focused five-character drama punctuated > with sharp, surprising flashes of aching humor. In the movie, however, > supporting roles are trimmed into near irrelevance, elbowed into the > background by the spotlight focused on Becca and Howie‚Äîor, more bluntly, on > Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart.

The director of a 2010 stage production of Rabbit Hole, Robert A. Norman, declared, \\"The 2010 movie version starring Nicole Kidman lacked the humor and hopefulness of the stage script.

He was a contributor to the music business in the mid-20th century, notably as a jazz commentator for Billboard Magazine and other publications. His liner notes can still be found on many record albums of the era. Raised in Springville, New York, Simon began his career in music in 1941 as the manager of his brother's record store in Buffalo, New York. In 1944 he moved to New York City and worked as a record salesman, record producer (he compiled the first Edith Piaf album issued in the USA) and jazz critic. He discovered the jazz clarinetist Tony Scott; they shared an apartment for 5 years and Simon was Scott's first manager. They remained lifelong friends. Simon spent several years (starting in 1955) as associate editor of Billboard Magazine and wrote a monthly column on jazz for The Saturday Review. He was manager and editor of the RCA Victor Popular Record Club, owned by the Book-of-the-Month Club, which later sold the Club to Reader's Digest, with Simon as part of the package. He stayed at Reader's Digest for 22 years, producing dozens of best-selling albums, such as The Great Band Era and Country Roads. He also conceived and was the editor of 17 Reader's Digest song books, including Treasury of Great Show Tunes and The Children's Songbook, which have sold in the millions and are still in print. Simon's articles appear in several jazz anthologies, including The Jazz Word (Ballantine Books 1960)The Jazz Word, \\"The Responsibility of the Artist\\", edited by Dom Cerulli, Burt Korall, Mort Nasatir, Ballantine Books, New York, 1960, pp. 31-36) and The Jazz Makers (Rinehart & Co. 1957).The Jazz Makers, \\"Charlie Christian\\", edited by Nat Shapiro and Nat Hentoff. Illustrated. 368 pp. New York: Rinehart & Co.,1957, pp. 316-331) For Record World's 1974 tribute to Sam Goody, Simon wrote the featured piece, \\"Sam Goody -- The Early Years,\\" on the occasion of Goody's 70th birthday and 35 years in the record business. (Simon worked for Goody for 5 years as salesman and record producer.) Simon was also a sheet music collector and a founder and past president of the New York Sheet Music Society. The William L. Simon Sheet Music Collection is a part of Indiana University Southeast's special collections . He also served on the board of directors of the National Academy of Popular Music (Songwriters Hall of Fame), and was a member of ASCAP. As a saxophonist, Simon and partner George T. Simon started the Simon Swing GroupThe New York Times, \\"Side Men\\" by Richard F. Shepard, Oct 21, 1981 which featured such guest artists as John Bunch, Dick Hyman, Tony Scott, Ram Ramirez, Eddie Daniels, Russell George, Ed Polcer, Warren Vache, Dan Fox and many others. They began the New York tradition of Twilight Jazz, playing at Eddie Condon's club during its final four years and then at Red Blazer Too and Jimmy Walker's. When he retired to Florida, Simon played at the Jazz Club of Sarasota's jam sessions. Remembering Time, a CD of Simon on saxophone as well as his musical compositions performed by others was produced posthumously by Gunnar Jacobsen and Jack Brokensha. Simon worked with lyricists Jack Yellen, Charles Tobias, Gene Lees and Chuck Darwin. Jack Yellen referred to the song \\"Remembering Time\\" as \\"my favorite non-hit\\" (Jack Yellen lyrics, Simon music). His musical compositions were performed by Carmen McRae, Teddi King, Tony Scott, Art Farmer, John Coltrane, B. Bopstein (pseudonym for Dizzy Gillespie), Don Byas, Oscar Pettiford, Jimmy Jones, Gene Ramey, Trummy Young and Ben Webster among others.

NETCOM's mission is to operate and defend the computer networks of the United States Army. The numerical command for NETCOM was 9th Army Signal Command, though this distinction was removed on 1 October 2011. Its heritage can be traced back to the creation of the 9th Service Company in 1918. The command headquarters is at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Major General Maria B. Barrett assumed command in November 2018. Mission NETCOM plans, engineers, installs, integrates, protects and operates Army Cyberspace, enabling Mission Command through all phases of Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational operations. Additionally, the commanding general is designated as the Deputy Commanding General for Network Operations, U.S. Army Cyber Command. With the headquarters at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, the NETCOM Team has nearly 16,000 Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians and Contractors stationed and deployed in more than 22 countries around the world, providing direct and indirect support to Army, Joint and Coalition forces.

The first subordinate command USSTRATCOM formed was STRATCOM-Europe, established 1 July 1964, in Schwetzingen, West Germany. STRATCOM-Europe absorbed 22nd and 106th Signal Groups and other communications responsibilities from USAREUR. By the end of 1965, all USAREUR communications duties, and even the position of USAREUR Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications‚ÄìElectronics, had been transferred to STRATCOM-Europe. Changes in signals/military communications continued through the 1970s; 7th Signal Brigade was activated in 1970 from assets of the deactivated Seventh Army communications command. STRATCOM-Europe assumed operational control of the brigade in June 1972 and was redesignated as Army Communications Command-Europe (ACC-E) in October 1973. The 106th and 516th Signal Groups were also inactivated during this time and replaced by the 4th Signal Group. STRATCOM established the 1st Signal Brigade to exercise command and control over all Army communications-electronics resources in Southeast Asia. Scattered among 200 sites in Vietnam and Thailand, this brigade became the largest combat signal unit ever formed. One of those units (formed in April 1969 until July that year), aided in the installation of modern communications equipment in Bang Phi, Thailand; improving the information networks for Southeast Asia. STRATCOM leaders moved to modify the command's designation to better suit its changing mission by dropping \\"strategic\\" from its organizational title. On 1 Oct. 1973, the Army re- designated STRATCOM as the U.S. Army Communications Command (USACC). U.S. Army Communications Command During the early 1980s, Army automation focused on the development of hardware and software systems. These systems were used for force development, personnel, supply, payroll, medical, maintenance, and troop support. Due to the scale of the work, the Army empowered USACC to lead development of strategic concepts for information systems management. USACC recommendations, combined with an Army Chief of Staff vision of consolidated information disciplines, gave genesis to the U.S. Army Information Systems Command (USAISC), the newest iteration of Fort Huachuca's strategic communications organization, on 1 May 1984. U.S. Army Information Systems Command Post Desert Storm Army downsizing and organizational review focused a critical eye on command structure. A general perception in the 1990s among major commands (MACOM) and theater commanders held that USAISC central management deprived them of needed command and control over regional and theater information systems, computer system acquisitions, and signal assets. The Department of the Army agreed and moved to dismantle USAISC, relegating the organization to major subordinate command status under U.S. Army Forces Command, and re-designating it as U.S. Army Signal Command (USASC) in September 1996. U.S. Army Signal Command Army MACOMs and theater commanders worked independently to resource their own Information System requirements. This decentralization and deregulation led to a proliferation of non-standardized command, control, communications, and computer (C4) systems and an unacceptable level of incompatibility among Army-wide communications equipment and support networks. The department of the Army on 1 Oct. 2002, decided to again centralize service C4 and many aspects of information systems management and security under one Army command: the U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM), reporting directly to the Army's Cyber Command (ARCYBER).

The film's budget was 23 Lakh and collected a share of 54 Lakh at the box office. That was the lowest share for a Dr Raj movie in the 80s. However, the movie still ended up making 30 Lakh profit.Moreover the movie just ran for 7 weeks (hardly 50 days) in cinema halls which again was the lowest for a Dr Rajkumar movie in the 1980s putting the then lowest Nee Nanna Gellalare to the second position. The low success rate of Guri, Ondu Muttina Kathe, Devatha Manushya and comparatively successful Parashuram (considered to be critically unsuccessful by the people) is said to have caused Dr. Rajkumar to temporarily retire from movies. He later came back through Jeevana Chaitra due to immense pressure from his fans. Over the following years, Ondu Muttina Kathe has achieved cult status which in turn is evident from it being frequently shown in Udaya TV and is considered as one of the most technically advanced films of the 80's era of Indian cinema. Soundtrack L. Vaidyanathan composed the background score for the film and the soundtracks. Lyrics for the soundtracks were penned by Chi. Udaya Shankar.

It takes its name from the short form of 'Bollywood Town', itself a tribute to the classic Soul music record label Motown which is short for Motor Town. Music The music of Botown blends the genres of Bollywood with classic Soul and Funk from the 1960s and 1970s. It is a musical reimagining of the Bollywood genre and references artists such as Ray Charles, James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone together with Bollywood Music Directors such as RD Burman, Laxmikant Pyarelal and Kalyanji Anandji. As well as Soul music, the band also draws inspiration from gospel, funk, jazz, Blues and reggae. Along with these musical influences Botown also add their original music and compositions. The band creates a musical link between what Srivastav calls the \\"working class music of India and America.\\" The band Botown is made up of many well known London based musicians all of whom are trained in various styles. The band was created and developed by Ajay Srivastav in late 2008 with the ethos of keeping music live and real. To this end the band is passionate about playing live and concerts include freeform and improvised sections with extended and sometimes spontaneous solo sections. Botown concerts are also well known for audience participation where fans sing and dance along with the band. Their first official public performance was in early 2009, though there were some 'warm up' shows in late 2008. The initial launch-shows were at the Watermans Arts Centre a venue well established in the UK Asian Arts scene. The concerts were a huge success and soon the band were regularly selling out venues such as Rich Mix, The Drum and the Broadway Barking. In the Summer of 2009, the band headlined at the Southampton Music festival and in August 2009 the band made history by being the first band to showcase Bollywood music at London's legendary Jazz Cafe. In 2010 the band headlined at the GLA Diwali in the Square Festival at Trafalgar Square in Central London and played to a crowd of 30,000 fans. In the Autumn of 2010 Botown released their debut single: Roop Tera, which was a Ray Charles inspired reworking of a Bollywood classic from the 1969 film Aradhana. The single hit the number one spot in the Official Asian Download Charts as played on the BBC Asian Network. The track combines Ray Charles inspired Gospel/Blues hooks with the SD Burman classic from the Bollywood film Aradhana. The critically acclaimed debut album the Soul of Bollywood was released in Winter 2010 and climbed the Amazon Funk Charts going top 10. It was the only Asian album to be given mainstream distribution through HMV shops in the UK that year and received a number of positive mainstream reviews including The Evening Standard and The Daily Express. In February 2011 Botown were nominated for a Lebara Mobile UK Asian Music Award in the category of 'Best Alternative Act'. In December 2011, Botown were given the Best Band of 2011 Award by Eastern Eye Newspaper. Songs from Botown's debut album 'The Soul of Bollywood' have featured a number of times on the UK's leading soap opera EastEnders on BBC1. Dum Maro Dum was featured in the episode broadcast on 8 March 2011, Churaliya on 24 March 2011 and Chaiyya Chaiyya was featured in a scene broadcast on 9 May 2011.

Biography Llewellyn Crichton (or Crighton) Davies was born in Cardiff, the son of William Henry Davies, the editor of the Cardiff Figaro, and Hanna Crighton, from Forfar. He was educated at Cardiff and at Halifax, and became a chartered accountant.du Ruvigny & Raineval (1922) On the outbreak of World War I, he was living in Pollokshields, Glasgow, and enlisted as a private in the 5th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) on 4 August 1914. On 7 March 1915 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Davies saw action with his regiment on the Western Front during the Battle of the Somme, and on 28 August 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: :Second Lieutenant Llewellyn Crighton Davies, Scottish Rifles. :For conspicuous gallantry in action. He handled his trench-mortars with great skill, and knocked out an enemy machine-gun that was holding up the advance. He also took charge of various parties that had lost their officers, and brought in single-handed a wounded man under heavy fire. In February 1917 he was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps as a flying officer (observer), and served with No. 22 Squadron as an observer/gunner in the FE.2b reconnaissance aircraft.Guttman & Dempsey (2007), pp.80 & 93. While flying with Captain Carleton Main Clement on morning formation patrol, he was credited with two Albatros D.III fighters destroyed on 6 and 8 April 1917, although they were shared with several others, including Gerald Gordon Bell. On 5 June, Davies and Clement destroyed an Albatros D.V and drove a second one down out of control. Davies was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July. On 29 July, having upgraded to a Bristol F.2 Fighter, Davies and Clement shot down another German aircraft, thought to be that of Kurt Schneider, Staffelf√ºhrer of Jasta 5. Schneider later died of wounds received in this action. In November 1917, Davies was reassigned to No. 105 Squadron.Franks et.al. (1997), p.13. He was appointed a flying officer on 27 February 1918, but on 13 March, while based at the 54th Training Depot Station, he was fatally injured after crashing his Airco DH.4 (serial number B5495), and died three days later at the Somerville Section of the 3rd Southern General Hospital in Oxford. Davies is buried at Holy Trinity Church, Penton Mewsey, Hampshire, England.

It tells the fictional story of a man mistakenly arrested by a group linked to the military dictatorship during the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Plot The film is set on mid 1970, when the military regime's \\"economic miracle\\" and the victory of the Brazilian national football team on the FIFA World Cup serves as a distraction for the persecution of opposition leaders by the political police of the dictatorship. Under this context, Jofre Godoi da Fonseca, an alienated middle class man, is mistaken for Sarmento, a political activist he met at an airport prior to his assassination. He is then arrested and brutally tortured by a paramilitary group of vigilantes sponsored by influential businessmen to hunt down people deemed \\"subversive\\" by the regime. Jofre's wife Marta and his brother Miguel join forces to investigate his disappearance.

He was born in Vienna, Austria and reportedly emigrated to the United States alone at age 16 to escape Nazism. During the O.J. Simpson murder trial, he testified that the presence of detectable amounts of the preservative EDTA found in blood at the scene indicated it may not have come from a human being, but possibly was planted. Other of his well- known cases include the Robert Curley, in which Curley's wife, Joann, poisoned him with thallium; another case is that of Michael Swango, or \\"Dr. Death\\"‚Äîa serial killer who killed as many as 60 of his patients at various hospitals he worked at using succinylcholine and epinephrine. Rieders also offered testimony in 1991 at one of the many trials at which Jack Kevorkian was a defendant. Rieders testified that Kevorkian might have used an excessive amount of the sedative thiopental, and the sedative might actually have killed her before a lethal dose of potassium chloride had a chance to stop her heart, as Dr. Kevorkian had intended. Rieders received his PhD in Pharmacology- Toxicology from Thomas Jefferson University. He worked as the Chief Toxicologist for the City of Philadelphia for fourteen years. He later founded National Medical Services in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania in 1970. Now called NMS Labs, it is a private toxicology lab that handles forensic and clinical toxicology. Rieders established the non-profit Fredric Rieders Family Renaissance Foundation. Most notably, he established the non-profit Forensic Sciences Mentoring Institute, described as a \\"hands-on research and academic instruction organization designed to support scientific and humanitarian activities serving students of all ages but specifically the young and especially the disadvantaged.\\" Currently the Foundation is affiliated with Arcadia University's Master of Science in Forensic Science program. Rieders died on November 26, 2005, aged 83. O.J. Simpson murder trial Dr. Rieders testified in the criminal trial of O.J Simpson on July 24, 1995 and August 14, 1995. His testimony was interrupted because he had to leave the country. When he returned, according to the Los Angeles Times, \\"Not only did he refuse to answer questions directly, but his mood ranged from belligerent to confused.\\"  References  Category:1922 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American toxicologists Category:American forensic scientists Category:American people of Austrian descent ","title":"Fredric Rieders"},{"id":"24342879","text":"There are several rivers named Da Prata River or Rio da Prata.

It is located on the grounds of the former home of sculptor Carl Milles (1875‚Äì1955) and his wife, artist Olga Milles (1874-1967). Millesg√•rden consists of three main parts: the artist's former home, an art gallery, and a sculpture park. History In 1906, the artist couple Carl and Olga Milles bought a plot on Liding√∂. The house was designed by architect Karl M. Bengtson (1878-1935) and inaugurated in 1908. Later renovations and extensions were done in collaboration with Milles's brother architect Evert Milles (1885-1960). They planned to build a home associated with art. At Millesg√•rden the works are mainly by Carl Milles. At the entrance of the middle terrace is a sculpture garden and another sculpture workshop, Lilla Atelj√©n. This was the primary residence of Carl and Olga Milles until 1931. In 1936, Millesg√•rden was transformed into a foundation which was handed over as a gift to the Swedish people. The Woodland chapel was added in the late 1940s and is the site of burial for Carl and Olga Milles. In the early 1950s, Anne's House build after drawings by Evert Milles. The house was planned for Milles's secretary, Anne Hedmark (1899-1993), who in 1950 took up the post of Millesgarden's hostess and curator. She lived there until 1986. The newest building on Millesg√•rden is Millesg√•rden Art Hall, which is located along one side of the lower terrace. The Millesg√•rden Art Hall was designed by architect Johan Celsing and was inaugurated in October 1999.  Millesg√•rden in popular culture  Millesg√•rden is the setting of the opening scene of Poul Anderson's acclaimed science fiction novel Tau Zero, and several of the sculpture garden's works are described.Anderson, Poul Tau Zero, Doubleday, 1970, p.1  Gallery  File:Millesg√•rden 1986.jpg|Europa and the Bull File:Millesg√•rden 2009.jpg|Angels playing music File:Milles Kanu.jpg|Indian with canoe File:Milles Pegasus 2008.jpg|Man and Pegasus File:Guds hand 2007.jpg|God's Hand File:Milles Eislaeuferin 2007.jpg|Skridskoprinsessan File:C Milles Millesgarden Alg statue.jpg|Alg File:Folkungabrunnen 2007.jpg|Folkungabrunnen Buildings at Millesg√•rden Millesg√•rden kapell 2007.jpg|Woodland chapel Milles Annas hus.jpg|Anne's House Celsing Milles konsthall.JPGMillesg√•rden Art Hall Interior Millesg√•rden 2009c.jpg|Carl Milles' studio Millesg√•rden interi√∂r 2007a.jpg|Milles antique collection File:Millesg√•rden interi√∂r 2007.jpg|Interior Millesg√•rden 2008a.jpg|Living room in Anne's House  See also  * List of museums in Stockholm  References  Other sources *Anders Bergstr√∂m (2004) Millesg√•rden - Arkitektur och tr√§dg√•rd (Stockholm: Atlantis)  External links  * Millesg√•rden website (in English and Swedish) Category:Art museums and galleries in Stockholm Category:Sculpture gardens, trails and parks in Sweden Category:Art museums established in 1936 Category:1936 establishments in Sweden Category:Sculpture galleries in Sweden ","title":"Millesg√•rden"},{"id":"24342900","text":"Zero Hour is a 2006 one-person play written and performed by playwright and actor Jim Brochu and directed by actress Piper Laurie. In a biographical reflection on Zero Mostel, Brochu portrays the Jewish actor and comedian giving a fictional interview with an unseen New York Times reporter shortly before Mostel's death in 1977. Brochu's Mostel recounts his life and career; he describes the impact of the Hollywood blacklist on himself and his friends, including his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee, as well as his success with A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Fiddler on the Roof and the original movie version of The Producers. A lifelong admirer of Mostel, Brochu found inspiration during his research into the adversity Mostel faced, including his parents' rejection of his marriage to a Catholic woman and a bus accident that resulted in a severe leg injury, and how his \\"sense of humor saved him\\". Writing the play during intermissions of another show he was working on, Brochu also drew upon his own recollections of Mostel, including seeing the actor in Forum and visiting him backstage: > I went down and Zero was outside of his dressing room reading the Riot Act > to one of the other actors. The actor had upstaged him or done something. He > was screaming at this actor and finished with, Now never do it again! The > actor walked away and he looked at me and said, Well, hello!. How are you? > Come visit me. After seeing the play, Mostel contemporary Theodore Bikel wrote to Brochu, \\"Thank you for bringing back a volcano that we thought was long extinct.\\" The play premiered at the Egyptian Arena Theatre in Hollywood, California, presented by the West Coast Jewish Theatre and directed by Paul Kreppel.

It was initiated by inclement weather approaching New York City. Air traffic controllers were confronted with a record number of pilots filing instrument flight plans causing severe traffic congestion and substantial delays amongst 45,000 airline passengers and private aircraft all along the eastern seaboard of the United States.Nolan, M.S. (1999). Fundamentals of air traffic control. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks Cole Publishing Company. Background In the 1940s and 1950s air travel increased at a greater rate than air traffic control's ability to handle the traffic. In normal clear weather pilots could fly without air traffic control but when inclement weather occurred, pilots would obtain clearance from air traffic control and fly on the federal airways at 50 to 100 miles separation. Frequently, weather would overload the system and cause delays up to 1,000 miles away.

This approach to political organizing is primarily associated with Native Americans organizing for social justice and cultural revitalization in the Continental United States, but has spread to some other Indigenous communities as well. Inuit and M√©tis people may consider themselves part of the broader, pan-Aboriginal community, or some variation thereof. Some academics have also used the term pan-Amerindianism to distinguish from other peoples known as \\"Indians\\". Some pan-Indian organizations seek to pool the resources of Indigenous groups in order to protect the interests of Native peoples across the world.Waldman, Carl (2009). \\"Atlas of The North American Indian\\" (Third ed.), pp 262, 264, 241. Checkmark Books., New York Early history In 1912 members of the Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Chickasaw tribes, united by their opposition to Allotment, formed the Four Mothers Society for collective political action. Also in 1912, the Alaskan Native Brotherhood and Sisterhood came together, centering on their shared interest of the protection of Native resources. In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, which reversed assimilation and allotment policies. This act granted \\"legal sanction to tribal landholdings; returned unsold allotted lands to tribes; made provisions for the purchase of new lands; encouraged tribal constitutions, systems of justice, and business corporations; expanded educational opportunities through new facilities and loans ...; advocated the hiring of Indians by the Office of Indian Affairs ...; extended the Indian Trust Status; and granted Indians Religious Freedom.\\" Key events Before there were successful national and continental organizations, there were several regional bodies which united multiple nations (tribes or bands) within the context of post-settlement politics. The Grand General Indian Council of Ontario was organized with missionary assistance in the 1870s and persisted until 1938. Likewise, the Allied Tribes of British Columbia were created in 1916. In 1911, the first national Indian political organization in the US was created, the Society of American Indians. This organization pursued such things as better Indian educational programs and improved living conditions. This was paralleled by the establishment of League of Indians of Canada in 1919, Canada's first Aboriginal organization that was national in scope. The Society of American Indians was the most influential of the early pan-Indian organizations. It played a critical role in advocating Indian citizenship, which was finally granted by the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. Before World War II and throughout the 1940s and '50s, Native activism was less developed and for the most part nonviolent. Many leaders made a genuine effort to work with the American government. In 1922, as a symbolic gesture, Deskaheh, a Cayuga chief, traveled to the League of Nations in Geneva in hopes of obtaining recognition of his tribe's sovereignty but his request was denied. In 1939, the Tonowanda Band of the Seneca tribe issued a \\"Declaration of Independence\\" to the state of New York. It was ignored and natives who broke state law were arrested. In other cases, American Indian tribes struggled to maintain their sovereignty over tribal land that had been granted to them by treaties with the federal government. Unrelated Native American groups, and Americans in general, began to notice and sympathize with their aims. For one week in June 1961, 420 American Indians from 67 tribes convened for the American Indian Chicago Conference held at the University of Chicago. After exchanging opinions that covered many aspects of Indian affairs, the Declaration of Indian Purpose was drafted. In 1989, the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, also known as the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Convention No. 169, occurred. To date, this has been the only formally binding international convention that specifically applies to indigenous peoples. The conference recognized the goal of native groups to maintain their position as entities independent of national governments.\\"C169 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989\\" International Labour Organization, 2006.

All Indian Pueblo Council The All Indian Pueblo Council, founded in 1922, successfully opposed the proposed Bursum Bill, which legislated rights for squatters on Native grounds along the Rio Grande. The All Indian Pueblo Council declared that Pueblo Indians had been living in a \\"civilized condition\\" long before European Americans came over to America. They appealed to public morality by claiming to have pride in their past. The All Pueblo Council needed public support to help preserve lands, customs, and traditions; and to turn interest to the Pueblo tribes so they can gain assistance in court.Hoxie, Frederick E (2001). \\"Talking Back to Civilization\\", p.24.

American Indian Movement Flag of the American Indian Movement The American Indian Movement was created in 1968 in Minneapolis by Dennis Banks, George Mitchell, and Clyde Bellecourt (all Ojibwe), and Russell Means (Lakota. AIM became well known for their involvement in the Wounded Knee incident in 1973, and the seizure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1972. Inspired by groups like The Black Panthers, AIM took a new, more radical, approach than had previous Native groups, using direct action at protests, and arguing for liberation instead of assimilation. They advocated for the abolition of the Office of Indian Affairs (which was promoting assimilation). They mobilized many people to become activists and quickly became the most visible of the pan-Indian organizations of the era. Assembly of First Nations Founded in 1967, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), formerly known as the National Indian Brotherhood, is a representatative body of First Nations leaders in Canada.

The formation of the NCAI was encouraged by John Collier (reformer), who realized that the United States Congress and the people were becoming more focused on World War II and less attention was focused on Native American affairs. The NCAI decided to dedicate themselves to lobbying for or against specific legislation and also to focusing on civil and voting rights.

Their work resulted in an action program and a newspaper called ABC: Americans Before Columbus. What seems particularly interesting about the NIYC is the approaches that they took and still take today towards achieving their goals. For instance, they held \\"fish-ins\\" along the rivers in Washington in order to protest the treaty-given fishing rights that were being taken away from them. This was due to a nullified supreme court decision. These incidents are not unlike the number of sit-ins held by young African-Americans during the civil rights movement, in protest of equal rights not being granted to them. Society of American Indians This organization was founded by the Yavapi Indian Carlos Montezuma. The SAI was at the forefront in the fight for Indian citizenship, which was eventually granted in 1924. Their efforts resulted in a number of fish-ins along rivers to support aboriginal fishing rights nullified by a state supreme court decision. This is very comparable to the sit-ins that were held during the civil rights movement when young African American students held sit-ins at lunch counters. When thinking of this comparison, it allows you to think of the immense efforts that American Indians have already put forth and are still putting forth to gain their civil rights. Early activism The first major recorded action of American Indian activism happened in 1901. A Muskogee creek named Chitto Harjo led a rebellion (also known as the Crazy Snake Uprising) against Allotment in Indian Territory. He and his followers harassed non-natives as well as natives in favor of Allotment. Although this rebellion ended in the arrest of Harjo and his anti- allotment followers (including some Cherokee), the Four Mothers Society for collective political action was formed in 1912. This committee took a more formal approach by sending delegates to congress to argue their cause against Allotment.McIntosh Kenneth W. \\"CRAZY SNAKE UPRISING\\", Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, Retrieved 18 October 2009. Creation of the Office of Economic Opportunity The OEO was founded in 1964 as a result of Indian support of Point IV program very similar to Wilson's Point IV program in his War on Poverty. OEO created a \\"symbiotic relationship\\" with NCAI and Indian Division, making an anti BIA. One goal of the OEO was to help Native Americans gain skills and experience that would enable them to move up the bureaucratic ladder, control the OEO programs, become the managers of the OEO programs, decide where the money made by the tribe will go, what programs to make, and get Native land back.Cobb, Daniel M. (2008). \\"Native Activism in Cold War America\\", p.127. University Press of Kansas., Kansas. Some OEO programs that benefit Native Americans are the Job Corps, Neighborhood Youth Corps, Operation Headstart, VISTA, Legal Services and the Community Action Programs.Cohen, Felix S. \\"Handbook of Federal Indian Law\\", p.190. The Community Action Programs give tribes \\"the opportunity to develop and administer their own economic and social programs.\\" The OEO also \\"channel[ed] federal funding directly to tribal governments\\". Tribal governments submit plans for local projects to the Office of Economic Opportunity. Once the members of the tribe approved the plan, \\"the OEO contracted with the tribal government to operate the project\\", and provided the necessary, budgeted funds.McNickle, D'Arcy and Iverson, Peter. \\"Native American tribalism: Indian survivals and renewals\\" p.119.

The Red Power movement is the activist movement that came to prominence in the 1960s. It was the Civil Rights Movement of the American Indian. One of the key events in the Red Power movement was the Occupation of Alcatraz. The occupation started on 20 November 1969 with 79 Indians disembarking on Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay, and ended 19 months and 9 days later on 11 June 1971. The group placed demands, which consisted of the deed to Alcatraz and funding to establish a university and a cultural center.\\"Alcatraz is Not an Island: The Occupation, 1969‚Äì1971\\" \\"PBS\\", 2002. Retrieved on 2009-09-16. These demands were rejected, but the event received considerable media attention. Throughout the 1960s, the battle to regain fishing rights that had been previously guaranteed in treaties during the mid-nineteenth century but later restricted after WWII for conservation purposes, continued in the northwestern United States.Shreve, Bradley Glenn. \\"Red Power Rising: The National Indian Youth Council and the Origins of Intertribal Activism.\\" Diss.

Marlon Brando joined the fish-in effort and was arrested along with Episcopal minister John Yaryan on 2 March 1964 during a NIYC fish-in on the Puyallup River. Over the course of the fish-in efforts, over 45 tribes came together to support and help. For this reason, Clyde Warrior, a leader of the NIYC, considered the fish-in protests to be \\"the beginning of a new era in the history of American Indians\\" and other members of the NIYC considered the protesting to be \\"the greatest Indian victory of modern day.\\" In August 1970 and in June 1971, two separate occupations of Mount Rushmore occurred. These were efforts to reclaim the Black Hills and to insist that the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 be honored and recognized by the United States of America. In November 1972, the Trail of Broken Treaties Caravan occurred. This involved the American Indian Movement, the National Indian Brotherhood (a Canadian organization), the Native American Rights Fund, the National Indian Youth Council, the National American Indian Council, the National Council on Indian Work, National Indian Leadership Training, and the American Indian Committee on Alcohol and Drug Abuse. The cross-country caravan eventually converged on Washington D.C. where the organizations demonstrated for six days. Eventually, a group took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Many public documents where destroyed during the takeover. A more violent demonstration began in February 1973, when members of the American Indian Movement and the Oglala Sioux occupied the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890 located in the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. This siege ended after 71 days with the surrender of the AIM group. Two Indians, Frank Clearwater and Buddy Lamont, were killed; one federal marshal was injured.

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo in 1999, Johnson said of the album: \\"I definitely had a creative urge to fulfil. I had written a book and was producing art, but I was still writing songs as well. Now, though, it's harder because I run my own record label as well as the music. I really hope people like this record but, if they don't, tough.\\" Critical reception On its release, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian noted the album's \\"decidedly spiritual bent\\", with some of the songs containing a \\"rather pat optimism\\". She added: \\"The message would resound more profoundly if it were accompanied by some decent tunes, rather than colourless beats-by- the-yard that do nothing for Johnson's reedy voice.\\" Sullivan picked \\"Disco Heaven\\" and \\"Legendary Children\\" as the album's two best tracks. In a retrospective review, Jon O'Brien of AllMusic wrote: \\"Soulstream isn't without its charms, but after such a lengthy absence, Johnson needed to recapture the glorious pop spirit of his previous outfit if he was to make any impression on a chart scene vastly different from when he left it, something its clich√©d and disappointingly bland sound resolutely failed to do.\\" He noted the \\"infectious camp Euro-disco\\" of both \\"Hallelujah\\" and \\"Disco Heaven\\", but felt most of the songs sounded \\"at least five years out of date\\".

From around the middle of the 19th century, vessels called chain boats were used to haul strings of barges upstream by using a fixed chain lying on the bed of a river. The chain was raised from the riverbed to pass over the deck of the steamer, being hauled by a heavy winch powered by a steam engine. A variety of companies operated chain boat services on rivers such as the Elbe, Rhine, Neckar, Main, Saale, Havel, Spree and Sa√¥ne as well as other rivers in Belgium and the Netherlands. Chain boats were also used in the United States. The practice fell out of favour in the early 20th century when steamships with powerful engines and high boiler pressures ‚Äì able to overcome the force of the river current ‚Äì became commonplace.  Historical development   Early technical developments before the 19th century  The transportation of goods by river in the early days of the chain boat was restricted to wooden ships without their own on-board power. When travelling downstream, boats were either simply propelled along by the current or sails would employ wind power. To move upriver, men or draught animals on towpaths were used to haul the boats on long ropes. In shallow waters boats could also be propelled upstream by long poles. Where towing from a towpath on the riverbank was not possible, a method known as warping was used. These sections of river could be negotiated by anchoring a rope ahead of the boat and then using the crew to haul it upstream.Sigbert Zesewitz, Helmut D√ºntzsch, Theodor Gr√∂tschel: Kettenschiffahrt. VEB Verlag Technik, Berlin, 1987, Mariano's concept of ship haulage in his Munich drawing (1438) In an illuminated manuscript dating to 1438, the Italian engineer, Jacopo Mariano, illustrated the fundamental concept on which chain boat navigation was subsequently based. The boat is pulling itself upstream on a cable laid along the river. The rope is wrapped around a central shaft driven by two, side-mounted water wheels (see upper diagram). Behind the river craft is a small boat-like object being pulled by the current, that is holding the cable taut and thus ensuring the necessary friction on the shaft.Feldhaus, Franz M.: Die Technik der Vorzeit, der geschichtlichen Zeit und der Naturv√∂lker, Ein Handbuch f√ºr Arch√§ologen und Historiker, Museen und Sammler, Kunsth√§ndler und Antiquare.

Brandstetter, Leipzig, 1910, pp. 399‚Äì401 digitalized text Fausto Veranzio's concept of ship haulage around 1595 In 1595 Fausto Veranzio described a system of cable boat navigation that enabled greater speeds, which also did not need any additional means of propulsion. Two boats are connected by a cable that is led round a pulley anchored firmly to the riverbed. The smaller boat, which is travelling downstream, is moving very fast, driven by the large water sails on either side and is thereby hauling the larger boat upstream against the current. The large barge in the picture has two, side-mounted water wheels that coil up the cable and increase its speed further. It is not, however, recorded whether the system was used in practice. In 1723 Paul Jacob Marperger, who later became the Electoral Saxon Kommerzienrat described a proposal by mathematics professor, Nicolaus Molwitz from Magdeburg, to use mechanical assistance in order to cope with the fast currents below Magdeburg's bridges. At that time, 50 men were needed to negotiate this section of the river. The idea was to build a 'machine' with two horizontal shafts, the towing cable being turned around the front shaft in such a way that it was continuously being unwound from it again and onto the rear shaft. According to Marperger, with the additional use of levers it should have been possible for five or six men to successfully effect the passage of the boat. At the same time, however, he stressed that the machine was \\"produced\\" but \\"never taken into use\\". From his description, elements of this basic principle seem to be similar to those subsequently used later in building chain boats. This section of river was later to become the starting point for the first chain boats in Germany. Marshal Maurice of Saxony's cable boat (1732) The first practical attempts to use a cable boat were in 1732 at the instigation of Marshal Maurice of Saxony, then in French service. These took place on the River Rhine in the vicinity of Strasbourg. Three pairs of cylinders of various diameters were arranged on a horizontal shaft and driven by two horses. Depending on the required force, the rope was hauled in by winding it round one of the pairs of cylinders whilst the other two pairs coasted. The variable ratio allowed for a better utilization of force. Compared with the towing from the land this system could move double the load for the same number of draught horses per craft.Cpt. C.V. Supp√°n: Wasserstrassen und Binnenschiffahrt, Verlag A. Troschel, Berlin, 1902, pp. 261‚Äì270, digitalized text  Experiments in the first half of the 19th century  After 1820 several inventors in France worked separately, but simultaneously, on the technical implementation of boats that could be moved by cables or chains. These included engineers, Tourasse and Courteaut, who conducted experiments on the River Sa√¥ne near Lyon. They attached a roughly towing cable made of hemp to the riverbank. This was wound around a rotating drum on board, which hauled the boat forward. Six horses were used to rotate the drum. With advancing industrialisation in the 19th century, the demand for transport capacity on the waterways increased markedly. But this industrialisation also revolutionized the methods of transport themselves. The invention of the steam engine meant that, for the first time, a motor was now available to power ships independently of wind and wave. The power of the first steam engines was, however, relatively low whilst, at the same time, they were very heavy. So attempts were made to utilize its power in the most effective way to move ships. Somewhat later the two engineers, Tourasse and Courteaut, undertook trials on the Rhone between Givors and Lyon using steam power. A steam-driven escort ship transported the hemp rope upstream and anchored it to the shore. Then the escort returned and took the bitter end of the rope to the actual tugboat. The latter hauled itself upriver on the rope, passing it to the drum on the escort ship as it went. During this process a second escort ship hurried upstream in order to anchor a second rope and thus save waiting time. Vinochon de Qu√©mont carried out trials on the River Seine in which the rope was replaced with a chain. The results of the first trials may be read in the 1866 Yearbook of Inventions: Although all these [previous] attempts did not use a continuous chain, rather the tow chain always had to be taken forward by a boat before the ship could be set in motion, the results appeared to be so pleasing that by 1825 under the leadership of Edouard de Rigny a company was formed based on these systems in order to negotiate the River Seine on the section from Rouen to Paris.\\"Dampfwagen und Dampfschiffe\\", In: The introduction of the entreprise de remorquage failed, however, due to faulty design. The chain steamer, La Dauphine, was not built exactly to the Tourasse's specification. The draught was too great and the engine too underpowered. In addition the shafts were too far aft on the deck.Gustav Carl Julius Berring: \\"Die Tauerei-Schiffahrt auf der Seine\\". In: Centralblatt der Bauverwaltung, Berlin, 1881, pages 189‚Äì191 Moreover, the company's capital was insufficient. In 1826, M.F. Bourdon tested a variant with two steam ships. One of the ships drove forward using a paddle wheel whilst simultaneously uncoiling a rope, long. After unwinding the rope fully, the ship anchored and hauled the second tugboat with its chain of attached barges up to itself, the rear tugboat assisting the process with its own power. The two boats then changed position and repeated the procedure. However, a lot of time was lost during the anchoring manoeuvre. From the time of those early attempts in the first half of the 19th century, chain boat technology improved steadily and the first successful use of chain boats in France took place. After that, other French rivers and canals were also provided with chains. In Germany, chains were laid in the Elbe, Neckar, Main, Spree, Havel, Warthe and Danube. In Russia too, chain boat navigation became widespread. In all, about of chain were laid in Europe.  Changes in chain boat navigation in the second half of the 19th century  Chain boats revolutionized inland waterway transport, especially on rivers with strong currents. Compared with the hitherto standard towing method, a chain boat could haul many more and much larger barges. The possible load of a single barge rose five times in just a few years. In addition, the chain boat transport was much faster and cheaper. The number of trips a boat could make increased, for example, on the Elbe almost three times.Erich Plei√üner: \\"Konzentration der G√ºterschiffahrt auf der Elbe\\". In: Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Staatswissenschaft, Verlag der H. Lauppschen Buchhandlung, T√ºbingen, 1914, Erg√§nzungsheft L, pp. 92‚Äì113, digitalised version at archive.org Instead of two trips per year, the skipper could annually make six to eight journeys or instead of covering , his craft could sail up to annually. Delivery times were accordingly shorter and more reliable; at the same time reducing costs.Hermann Schwabe: Die Entwicklung der deutschen Binnenschiffahrt bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts.

Siemenroth & Troschel, Berlin, 1899, pp. 57‚Äì58 Through the use of the steam engine it was now possible, for the first time, to meet the rising demand for the transport capacity driven by increasing industrialization in the second half of the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Chain boat navigation gave sailors and their barges the opportunity to compete against increasing competition from the railways. Before the introduction of chain boats, paddle steamers were already working as tugs and cargo boats on some stretches of river, but they did not hail a breakthrough in mass transport. Due to its dependence on the water level of the river and on market economic interests, the steamer could not guarantee a regular service. Not until regular services with fast connections, as well as the guaranteed, low transportation costs of the chain boats, could river barge transportation begin to be competitive.\\"Kettenschifffahrt auf der s√§chsischen Elbe\\", In: Austria, Archiv f√ºr Consularwesen, volkswirthschaftliche Gesetzgebung und Statistik, Jahrgang XXII, No. 34, Kaiserl.-K√∂nigl. Hof- und Staatsdruckerei, Vienna, 1870, pages 638‚Äì639 With the development and growth in the use of new forms of power, such as the screw propellor and diesel engine in the first half of the 20th century, self-propelled vessels increasingly superseded the chain boat. The development of river systems and competition from road and rail further reduced the profitability of the chain boat industry that was designed for continuous towing. In time, the use of chain boats became restricted to a few particularly difficult sections of river.  Distribution in Europe   France  Map of the distribution of chain boat services in France In 1839, the first technically and economically successful chain steamer, Hercule, was built and on a roughly stretch of fast- flowing water on the River Seine within the city of Paris.J. F√∂lsche: \\"Kettenschiffahrt auf der Elbe und auf der Seine\\". In: Deutsche Bauzeitung 1 (1867), pp. 306‚Äì307 and pp. 314‚Äì316 It was on this very same section of the river that de Rigny had failed a few years earlier due to technical difficulties. Starting from Paris in 1854, chain boat services spread upstream to the town of Montereau at the confluence with the Yonne, as well as downstream to Conflans (at the mouth of the Oise). From 1860, services were expanded towards the mouth of the Seine. The maximum total length of the chain in the Seine was . In addition, in 1873 another route on the Yonne itself ‚Äì between Montereau and Auxerre ‚Äì was added. The nature of the riverbed of the Seine offered ideal conditions for chain boats. The river was uniformly deep, had a relatively steep gradient and its bed was sandy and even. By contrast, rivers whose source lay in the Alpine region, were less suitable. This meant that, especially when the rivers were in spate that they carried large amounts of sand with them. In trials carried out on the Rhone, it was found that the chain frequently became buried by sand and stones. Trials on the Sa√¥ne also failed and were relatively quickly terminated. The chain boats also provided river transportation on the canals in France, as well as on the rivers. Tunnels on the highest level of these canals were very long and electrically driven chain boats were used to tow boats through them. Due to the lack of ventilation in the tunnel systems, electrically operated chain boats continued to be used even after the introduction of self-propelled motor vessels.  Belgium  In 1866, in BelgiumKarl Pestalozzi: \\"Internationaler Congress f√ºr Binnenschifffahrt in Br√ºssel\\" . In: Schweizerische Bauzeitung, Vol. 5/6, Verlag A. Waldner, Z√ºrich, 1885, p. 67 chain steamers plied the Canal de Willebroek between Brussels and the canal's confluence with the Rupel. Unlike chain boats in France and Germany, chain boats in Belgium used the von Bouqui√© system, whereby the chain was not led down the centre line of the ship, but simply over a chain wheel at the side of the ship. The chain wheel was fitted with teeth to prevent the chain slipping.R. Ziebarth: \\"Ueber Ketten- und Seilschifffahrt mit R√ºcksicht auf die Versuche zu L√ºttich im Juni 1869\\".

Ministeriums des Inneren, Vienna, 1895  German Empire and Empire of Austria  Distribution of chain boat navigation in Germany  Elbe and Saale  In Germany, chain boat navigation began in 1866 with the laying of an iron chain in the Elbe.Rolf Sch√∂nknecht, Armin Gewiese: Auf Fl√ºssen und Kan√§len ‚Äì Die Binnenschiffahrt der Welt, 1988, Verlag f√ºr Verkehrswesen, , p. 56 The first regular haulage service using a chain steamer took place on a section of the Elbe between Magdeburg-Neustadt and Buckau. The length of this route was about three-quarters of a Prussian mile (a good ‚Äì i.e. the actual length being ). At this point, by the Domfelsen, the river flowed particularly fast. The chain steamer was operated by the Hamburg- Magdeburg Steamship Company. The first two steamships on the Elbe were wide and long and fitted with engines generating about motorized, and hauled four barges of up to 250 tons. By 1871, the chain had already been extended from Magdeburg to Schandau on the Bohemian border. Three years later the Hamburg- Magdeburg Steamship Company extended the route northwestwards to Hamburg. Up to 28 chain boats rattled upstream over a total length of . In 1926‚Äì27, chain boats were withdrawn from large sections of the Elbe and the chains were lifted. Chain steamers were only used in the most difficult sections. The final section in Bohemia closed in 1948. On the Saale, chain boats were taken into service in 1873, running from its river mouth to the Calbe, and by 1903 services had been extended to Halle, a total of . The last chain boat on the Saale was still working in 1921.\\"Die Kette ‚Äì Ein Kapitel der Saaleschifffahrt\\". Preisnitzhaus e. V., retrieved 18 December 2009 (information brochure of the travelling exhibition).  Danube  After obtaining a concession to provide chain boat services in 1869, the Danube Steamship Company laid a chain between Vienna and Pre√üburg (the former name for Bratislava). However, in 1871, some sections of the river were already banning chain shipping. In 1881, chain boats were plying the Danube from Spitz to Linz. There were ten chain ships in use. The chain increasingly broke (on average once per trip) which was the reason why the chain boats were converted in 1890 into tugboats. In 1891, chain boat services were established between Regensburg and Hofkirchen (). In 1896, chain boat services between Vienna and Ybbs ceased and, in 1906, services between Regensburg and Hofkirchen were also terminated. Due to the strong current on the Danube, chain boats could not use the chain when travelling downstream. They therefore had to have large paddle wheels on their sides, as additional means of propulsion, generating .  Brahe  The lower Brahe (Polish: Brda) served as a link between the River Vistula and the well-developed network of waterways with Western Europe. This waterway was especially important for the transport of timber, but timber rafts on the Brahe river had to be towed upstream between the mouth of the Vistula and the Bromberg city locks. For many years, horses had been used to tow barges along this , very winding and relatively fast flowing section of the river. On 12 November 1868, the owner of the Bromberg Haulage Company (Bromberger Treibercomptoir), responsible for towing, applied for a licence for the introduction of a chain boat operation on the lower Brahe to the council in Bromberg. The concession granted on 3 June 1869 was limited to a period of 25 years and essentially corresponded to the Prussian regulations in force on the Elbe. Shortly thereafter, in the summer of 1869, the first trail run began using a chain steamer built by Maschinenfabrik Buckau. The operation had to be terminated in the autumn, however, as the boat could not deliver the required performance and speed. A replacement boat with sufficient power was introduced in summer 1870. Nevertheless, only one or two trips could be made per day. It was not until the construction of a short cut on the most critical stretch in March 1871, and the acquisition of a second chain boat in spring 1872, that significant number of timber rafts could be hauled by chain boats. One steamboat gathered the rafts near the mouth of the Brahe and hauled them about a kilometre upstream. It then handed over the and rafts to the second steamer for the remaining to the locks at Bromberg. The transport service was profitable and the number of chain boats was increased to four. On 30 April 1894, the Minister of Trade and Industry and the Minister of Public Works extended the concession by another 25 years.  Neckar  Chain boat barges on the river Neckar in Heilbronn, before 1885 By 1878, the first chain boat had also entered service on the River Neckar between Mannheim and Heilbronn, hauling nine barges. The operation of chains boats was managed by the Chain Ship Company of the Neckar (Kettenschifffahrt auf dem Neckar AG). However, the regulation of the flow of the river by locks in the 1930s, which enabled it to be upgraded into a major waterway, spelt the end of the hitherto still profitable Neckar chain boats and their replacement by large barges.  Havel and Spree  On the River Havel, too, there was a short period of trials with chain boats. Although the flow of Havel has always been low, nevertheless a large number of laden barges could be towed inexpensively using a chain steamer.

In the Havelland there were numerous brick factories whose products were transported almost exclusively by ship. In summer 1894, chain boats on the Havel and Spree were withdrawn. The development of the steam-driven tugboat with screw propellers had superseded them.  Main  Chain boats were also used on the River Main in the period from 1886 to 1936. The chain was laid in the navigable section of the river between Mainz and Bamberg. Up to 8 chain boats were in service on the Main. The chain was recovered from the Main in 1938 and re-used. The chain boats on the Main were also colloquially called the Maakuh or M√§√§kuh (\\"Main Cow\\").Otto Berninger: \\"Die Kettenschiffahrt auf dem Main\\" in den Mainschiffahrtsnachrichten des Vereins zur F√∂rderung des Schiffahrts- und Schiffbaumusums W√∂rth am Main, Issue No. 6 dated April 1987, 111 pages.

The chain extended over a length of from the river's confluence with the Volga to the city of St. Petersburg. From the start, the chain boat service achieved poor results. Subsequently, the company terminated the chain service on a section of the route approximately long that had a very slight gradient and replaced it with a tugboat service. On the remaining section with its strong currents the chain boats made a profit in many years of about 30%. In 1885, the company introduced 14 chain steamers on this stretch, each capable of .

In order to do this, the chain was lifted out of the water by a boom at the bow of the vessel and ran down the deck, following the longitudinal axis of the ship, to the chain drive in the middle. Power was transferred from the steam engine to the chain primarily through a drum winch. From there, the chain was led across the deck to the boom at the stern and back down to the river bed. Due to the lateral movement of the boom and the two rudders mounted at the front and rear, it was possible to relay the chain in the middle of the river again even at river bends.

The individual links were from good, weldable bars with a low carbon content. Depending on the section of the river the bars had a typical thickness of . Despite that, there were frequent breakages. The chain had shackles at an interval of several that could be opened when two chain boats met. Most of these high quality chains were made in England or France.  Encounter between boats travelling in opposite directions  If two chain boats met, a complex manoeuvre was necessary in which one boat passed the chain, using an auxiliary chain, to the other boat. This procedure meant a delay of at least 20 minutes for the boat travelling upstream, while the ship heading downstream suffered a delay of about 45 minutes as a result of the manoeuvre. The introduction of auxiliary engines enabled chain boats to travel downstream under their own power without using the chain, thus avoiding the need for these time-consuming operations.  Trials with \\"endless\\" chains  To avoid the large cost of buying a chain or cable, trials were carried out on the Rh√¥ne by Dupuy de Lome using an \\"endless\\" chain. The boat used its own chain, which was lowered by the forward boom into the water; its weight taking it down to lie on the river bed. At the stern, the chain was pulled up from the water again and hauled forward along the deck of the ship by the chain drive. Assuming that the lower part of the heavy, self-contained chain was unable to slide on the river bed, the ship could move forward. This type of propulsion was never used commercially because sufficient power transfer was only possible if the chain was the right length for the conditions. If the water was too deep, the length of the chain resting on the river bed became too short to generate the required friction. If the water was too shallow, the length of chain in the river became too great, and would not stretch out but lie in coils on the bottom. So variations in river depth complicated the handling of the vessel considerably.Carl Victor Supp√°n: Wasserstrassen und Binnenschiffahrt. A. Troschel: Berlin-Grunewald 1902, Abschnitt: Binnenschiffahrt. (Dampfschifffahrt., Zugversuche mittels endloser Kette. pp. 269‚Äì270)  Concessions  Chain shipping companies required a licence to operate chain boats. This concession guaranteed the company the sole right for this type of ship transport. Since the purchase of the chain and the chain boats represented a high financial burden for the operator, the concession had to offer some degree of security. But this did not eliminate competition from the railways, from paddle steamers or from normal towed barges. In return, the rights and obligations of the mariners were regulated in the concession. For example, every barge had to be transported at rates set by the state.  Comparison with paddle steamers  Chain boats not only had to face competition with the railways, but also on the waterways themselves. Compared with paddle steamers, chain steamers had advantages anywhere where the conditions were difficult for navigation, such as rapids, sharp bends in the river and shoals.  Currents and flow velocity  On a paddle wheel or screw steamer, water is pushed backwards in order to move it forward. A significant part of the energy is converted into turbulence and so is not available for the propulsion of the ship. The chain steamer, however, pulls forward on a solid chain and so can turn a much larger proportion of its steam power into thrust.Georg Schanz: \\"Studien √ºber die bay. Wasserstra√üen Band 1, Die Kettenschleppschiffahrt auf dem Main\\", 1893, C.C. Buchner Verlag, Bamberg, pp. 1‚Äì7 ‚Äì (digitalised form) by Digitalis, Bibliothek f√ºr Wirtschafts- und Sozialgeschichte, Cologne, retrieved 29 October 2009 For the same tractive force, it reduced coal consumption by about two thirds. At faster river flow rates, the advantage shifts more and more in favour of the chain steamer. In 1892, Ewald Bellingrath introduced the following general rule: at an average river gradient of 0.25‚Ä∞ paddle steamers are superior. Between 0.25‚Ä∞ and 0.3‚Ä∞ both types of craft are equivalent. Above 0.3‚Ä∞ the chain boat has the advantage. On gradients above 0.4‚Ä∞ paddle steamers find it increasingly difficult to make headway and from 0.5‚Ä∞ are completely unable to haul barges. Practical experience showed that free-running, paddle tugboats capable of could achieve a speed of about against a river current of . Thus they could provide a commercially viable service in currents of up to . Even larger gradients could be negotiated if they were only over a short distance. By slackening the tow ropes, paddle steamers could overcome the obstacle. By the time the attached barges entered the faster-flowing area, the steamer had already sailed past it and was able to generate its full traction again. At flow rates above , the power output would drop to zero. Many of the steeper sections of river were relatively short and could be overcome by paddle steamers using the manoeuvre described. However, fast currents when rivers were in spate could also be problematic for chain boats. Depending on the nature of the river bed, strong movements of sediment could lead to ements to aggradation, thus covering the chain with gravel and stones. A river bed with lots of ledges or large boulders ‚Äì such as on some sections of the Danube ‚Äì caused the chain to become snagged and was a major hindrance to chain boats. The water churned up by paddle steamers also resulted in significantly greater wave action, which led to a risk of increased shore damage. The additional currents and waves they generated also caused extra resistance for the towed barges. Behind a chain boat, by contrast, the water was calm.  Depth  Some chain boats had a shallow draft of just designed for use in very low water levels and thus adapted to the circumstances of many rivers of the time. Even at a depth of it was still possible to operate an effective service on the Neckar. Steamers, however, required significantly greater depths of to operate commercially. Moreover, in strong currents, the minimum water depth for steamers was greater. Tugboats with screw propulsion also need a greater water depths to be able to work effectively. Only a propeller that is deep under the water, can produce sufficient propulsion. Chain ships not only had a shallow draft; but their technical principle was also advantageous for low levels of water: in shallow waters, the chain rises at a shallow angle and a very high proportion of steam power could be converted into thrust. If the water depth was very high, it increased the proportion of energy needed to lifting the chain. The chain's weight exerted a force that was directed obliquely downwards and the efficiency decreased. In addition, maneuverability reduced with increasing depth.  Investment costs  The chain itself entailed high investment costs for the shipping company. On the section of the Main river, between Aschaffenburg and Kitzingen it is estimated that the cost of the first chain, including laying, was over one million marks. This corresponded almost exactly to the total price for the eight chain boats that were to be used on that section. The chain had to be continually maintained and had to be renewed approximately every 5 to 10 years. In addition to the cost of the chain was the cost of the conversion of ferries that, on this route, came to about 300,000 marks. This conversion was necessary because the chain used by the chain boats the cables used by the ferries were not allowed to cross. So the usual cable ferries had to be converted into reaction ferries.  Flexibility  The first chain ships could only operate when attached to the chain; that is, they used the chain when travelling both upstream and downstream. When two chain boats travelling in opposite directions met, they had to carry out special passing manoeuvres, which resulted in a major loss of time. On the Neckar river with seven chain boats that meant six passing manoeuvres costing at least five hours for those travelling downstream. In order to avoid this time-consuming operation, barges on certain stretches of river in France passed the chain of barges from one chain steamer to another. Such a transfer, however, also took up a significant amount of time. Barges were normally only towed upstream. When travelling downstream the barges were usually just allowed to drift with the current in order to save money, In strong currents, operating a long string of barges was quite dangerous. Should a chain boat be forced to stop suddenly (for example, if the chain broke), there was a serious risk that following ships would run into it and thus cause an accident. In the early days of the chain boat, paddle steamers were slower at making their way upstream that chain boats. When heading downstream, however, they were faster and could also haul barges with them. In addition to the technical limitations of chain boats, their owners were constrained by licence rules, which, for example, laid down the order of the movement and transport fees. They were not therefore as flexible in responding to supply and demand as the paddle steamer companies.  The demise of chain boats  One reason for the demise of chain boats was the improvement in the technical performance of the new paddle steamers. They were able to deliver greater traction for lower coal consumption. The compound engine on the paddle steamer, based on its power output, needed only about half the amount of coal. Chain steamers were not able to take advantage of these compound steam engines because of their uneven operation.\\"Der Schiffszug auf den Wasserstra√üen.\\" Der f√ºnfte internationale Binnenschiffahrts-Congress in Paris im Jahre 1892. In: Alfred Weber Ritter von Ebenhof: Bau Betrieb und Verwaltung der nat√ºrlichen und k√ºnstlichen Wasserstrassen auf den internationalen Binnenschifffahrts-Congressen in den Jahren 1885 bis 1894, Verlag des K.K. Ministeriums des Inneren, Vienna, 1895, pp.186‚Äì199, online: Internet archive At the same time, chain shipping companies suffered from high investment and maintenance costs. Another reason for their demise was the canalization of rivers. On the Elbe a lot of current regulating work had been carried out, which evened out the gradient, reduced bends in the river and removed the shallows. As a result, the advantages of chain ship were reduced. On the Main and Neckar, numerous dams and locks were also added, which created artificial barriers for the chain boats. The damming of the river increased water depths and reduced flow rates. In particular, long strings of barges had to be divided at the locks and fed through individually, causing a considerable loss of time.  Chain boats in literature  Mark Twain, the American author, gave a humorous, historic account of encountering chain boats on the River Neckar in Germany.

Life Van Delen was born in Heusden.Dirck van Delen biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken It is not clear with whom he apprenticed. Art historian have proposed both Frans Hals and Hendrick Aerts (who also specialized in architectural paintings) as his presumed masters. More plausible are studies under Pieter van Bronckhorst and/or Bartholomeus van Bassen in Delft. The influence of Hendrick Aerts could have reached van Delen in this manner. An apprenticeship in Delft would also explain why Anthonie Palamedesz was able to provide the figures in works by van Delen as witnessed by co-signed examples.Dirck van Delen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Interior with Ladies and Cavalier, 1629 Shortly after he was born his parents moved to Breda. He married in Middelburg in 1625. In 1626 he moved to Zeeland and became master of the toll house in Arnemuiden. From that year until his death he was registered in Arnemuiden where he sat on the town council, most of the time as burgomaster. He was a member of the Middelburg Guild of St. Luke from 1639-1665. In 1666 he gave to the Antwerp Chamber of rhetoric Olyftack a painting, which he had made in collaboration with the painter Theodoor Boeyermans. Two years later he became a member of the Olyftack. His relative renown is evidenced by the fact that in the early 1630s van Delen received a commission to paint five large canvases (four of which are about 3.1 meters high) that were installed in a house in The Hague that was owned by Count Floris II van Pallandt van Culemborg.* Walter Liedtke ; with Michiel C.

Web. 1 February 2016  Work  General Interior of a Church, 1628 Van Delen's work consists almost entirely of architectural paintings of imaginary palaces and church interiors. A single flower still life by his hand is known (formerly in the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen. His earliest paintings of palace scenes were influenced significantly by the work of Hans Vredeman de Vries and his son Paul Vredeman de Vries. He also produced some intimate interiors with genre scenes. Examples are the A Musical Company in a Renaissance Hall, a collaboration with Pieter Codde (1636, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen) and the Interior with Ladies and Cavalier, with figures copied after Dirck Hals (1629, National Gallery of Ireland). In these painting he emphasizes the walls and their panelling. Through his regular presence in Antwerp van Delen likely had an important influence on succeeding architectural painters in Antwerp. In his church interiors van Delen initially revealed the influence of the paintings made by the Flemish architectural painter Hendrick Aerts after the architectural prints of Jan van Londerseel. He may also have drawn inspiration for his gothicizing church architecture from Antwerp architectural painters, although he did not adopt their rigid tunnel perspective. His church interiors are in style also close to those of Bartholomeus van Bassen. Elaborate Palace Courtyard With Elegant Company, c. 1635 After 1630 van Delen‚Äôs style became more exuberant and palace exteriors became his favourite subject. Van Delen‚Äôs palette also became lighter and brighter. The fullness of the Antwerp Baroque style had by then taken a firm grasp of the artist. His palette also became brighter and lighter. The buildings he depicted became dominated by pink, white and black marble and were from then on decorated with an excess of sculpture.Dirck van Delen, An Elaborate Palace Courtyard With Elegant Company at Sotheby's Around 1640 van Delen produced his most ambitious works, which were more sober in colour. Thereafter his output rapidly declined. Collaborations The staffage of his works has at times been attributed to other painters, such as Anthonie Palamedesz, Dirck Hals, David Teniers the Younger and Hieronymus Janssens.Dirck van Delen, A Conversation in a Palace Courtyard at the National Galleries of Scotland There is some doubt about all of these attributions as van Delen lived in relative isolation and it would not have been easy for him to collaborate with these artists. He probably painted most figures himself and in old inventories only figures by Poelenburch and a certain Gerards are mentioned. It is more likely that he was a capable figure painter himself and that in many of his work he copied or took as his model the figures of contemporary figure specialists. Interior with figures in a picture gallery Van Delen is believed to have collaborated with the Antwerp painter Gonzales Coques, who painted the staffage, on the painting Interior with figures before a picture collection.Interior with figures before a picture collection at the Netherlands Institute for Art History It was believed earlier that it was Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg who painted the architectural setting but it is now ascribed to Dirck van Delen. The composition Interior with figures before a picture collection falls into the genre known as 'gallery paintings'.Marr, Alexander (2010) 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, 5 ‚Äî 25 Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The composition depicts a large gallery with many pictures on the walls and standing on the floor. A man and woman are sitting at a table on which are placed various sculptures and two children stand next to them. Possibly the picture depicts the Antwerp collector Antoon van Leyden (1626-1686), his wife Marie-An van Eywerven and their two daughters.Gonzales Coques and Dirck van Delen , Familie in een interieur met een schilderijenverzameling at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The couple appears to be discussing and appreciating some of the artworks in the gallery. They are thus portrayed as forming part of an elite who possess privileged knowledge of art. The composition aims to emphasize this notion that the powers of discernment associated with connoisseurship are socially superior to or more desirable than other forms of knowing. The pictures depicted in the room likely represent works of leading Antwerp painters. The presence of children in this type of composition has been explained by the popularity in the Netherlands during the 1660s and 70s of genre scenes showing domestic interiors and ‚Äòordinary‚Äô people.

It is the second song on the album, and has been played live together with album's first track, \\"Dialectic Chaos\\", which has brought positive comparisons to the two opening tracks \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" and \\"Set the World Afire\\" from Megadeth's 1988 album, So Far, So Good... So What!. The song was based on the mythos of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and was featured as a playable song on Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, along with both \\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\\" and \\"Sudden Death\\". Development The song, like a vast majority of Megadeth's songs, was written by Dave Mustaine, and was lyrically inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy, particularly Aragorn's speech at the Black Gate of Mordor during the Battle of the Morannon, as well as Th√©oden's speech at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. \\"This Day We Fight\\" is actually a direct quote from the film version of The Return of the King. The song was also further inspired by \\"warrior creed from the great Sun Tzu with the use of drums and flags in ancient war\\". Another song from the album, \\"How The Story Ends\\", drew inspiration from the same sources, with both songs containing what was considered a \\"brutal, blood-thirsty and aggressive\\" aesthetic which drew inspiration from violent fantasy films. Cropped view of the This Day We Fight! shirt Many reviews have complimented the synergy of the track with the one before it on the album. Adrien Begrand of Popmatters stated that he felt \\"With its furious back-and-forth solos, opening instrumental \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" wastes no time in showcasing that dynamic between Mustaine and Broderick, and combined with the pure speed of \\"This Day We Fight!\\", longtime fans will be instantly reminded of the bracing \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\"/\\"Set the World Afire\\" one-two punch that kicks off 1988‚Äôs great So Far, So Good... So What!.\\" Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic agreed, and wrote that \\"This Day We Fight! was cut from the same bloody cloth as \\"Set the World Afire\\". Indeed, \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" and \\"This Day We Fight!\\" have only been played live together, similar to the symbiotic nature of \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" and \\"Set the World Afire\\". The reason for this is that having an instrumental lead directly into an additionally heavy song, as an opening is a great way to engage the audience's attention, creating tension between the two songs. Composition \\"This Day We Fight!\\" is 3 minutes, 27 seconds long. ScrewAttack reviewer Prattz reviewed the song in full detail, and described the song having an \\"opening riff, that was reminiscent of Rust in Peace\\" which begins with \\"fast palm-muted notes that feel aggressive and complex. This intro is surprisingly powerful.\\" \\"After the opening verses, the song shifts into a different riff, more melodic but still as aggressive. When the last lyric on the verse ends the first solo starts.\\" The song then progresses, containing \\"a breathtaking, high-pitched bend followed by some insane shredding that shuffles through licks ending with a last, lower-pitched note. A short solo made to introduce you to the chorus.\\" Finally, the song culminates with a \\"solo that finally ends with Dave traveling from High-pitched to low-pitched notes really fast\\" and \\"standard triplets followed by some fast shredding that lowers the pitch slowly. Then he repeats the lick and the song ends with one last \\"THIS DAY I FIGHT!\\" In other media Chris Broderick received high acclaim for his guitar contributions on \\"This Day We Fight!\\" and \\"Dialectic Chaos\\". The song was featured in the 2010 video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, alongside \\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\\" and Mustaine's brand new game-only composition \\"Sudden Death\\". This is not however the first time a Megadeth song was found in one of the games of the franchise, as \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" was featured in Guitar Hero, and \\"Hangar 18\\" was featured in Guitar Hero II, with both songs beings released as downloadable content for Guitar Hero 5. \\"This Day We Fight!\\" is featured in one of the hardest levels of the game, during level 10, or the \\"Battle with the Beast\\" conclusion, alongside both \\"Sudden Death\\" and \\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\\". In the game, all three songs are classified as very difficult songs to play, requiring much skill with the series. A T-shirt was later released with the title of the song featured on it. Reception Endgame was very well received, and some of said praise was directed to \\"This Day We Fight!\\". In a song by song review of the album, Terrybezer of Metal Hammer praised the song and remarked that \\"lyrics inspired by Lord of the Rings and riffs inspired by fighting for your frigging life as a horde of hellbeasts bare down on you, this track is at once vintage and future Megadeth. You‚Äôll hear remnants of the same hyperaggression of \\"Rust in Peace... Polaris\\", \\"Take No Prisoners\\" and \\"Poison Was The Cure\\" from Rust in Peace, but fed through the more modern approach of tracks like \\"Kick the Chair\\" from The System Has Failed and \\"Sleepwalker\\" from United Abominations. Peter Hodgson of \\"iheartguitar\\" was positive of the song and wrote that \\"The pace of it, the unrelenting aggression, the insane fret-work ‚Äì Mustaine sounds beyond pissed-off and this is going to kick all kinds of ass when it‚Äôs blasted out live. The shredding on this track will melt your face and blow your mind.\\" Bob Zerull of Zoiks! Online remarked that \\"the album kicks right into \\"This Day We Fight.\\" What a great metal song. I can already picture the guys in the pit bouncing off the walls. It has everything I like in a song, a monster riff, great lead guitar and a tight rhythm section.\\" \\"This Day We Fight!\\" has also been described as \\"possibly Megadeth's best song of the past 20 years, with speed, ferocity and anger that even younger bands would have trouble keeping up with\\". Dialectic Chaos \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" is the opening track of Megadeth's Endgame. It contains no lyrics, making it the only instrumental track on the album, and is considered to hold a kinship with \\"This Day We Fight!\\", similar to \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" and \\"Set the World Afire\\" from Megadeth's 1988 album, So Far, So Good... So What!, so much so, that the songs have only ever been played live together. Thus, \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" was the song used to open several live performances. The two songs combined total 5:54. The song is Megadeth's first fully instrumental track since \\"Silent Scorn\\" from The World Needs a Hero in 2001.The Realms of Deth - Megadeth Lyrics - The World Needs a Hero Reception \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" has however been able to find its own identity as a song, and has been described as \\"the epic instrumental\\", \\"the gateway to this record\\" and \\"fast, rude and in your face\\" by reviewers. In a song by song review of the album, Terry Bezer of Metal Hammer described it as a \\"truly epic 2-minute instrumental crammed with blazing solos opens Endgame! Mustaine has recently been telling all and sundry that former Nevermore and Jag Panzer man Chris Broderick is the best fellow axeman he‚Äôs ever had in Megadeth and on this blistering opening (and throughout the album), the lead trade-off‚Äôs between the two are nothing short of mind-blowing.\\" It has also been described as \\"superb\\" and has been favorably compared to \\"Wake Up Dead\\".

Early life and service in artillery On 19 October 1895, August Delling was born on a farm at Braunetsrieth in northeastern Bavaria. As World War I began, Delling joined the Bavarian artillery service in August 1914. By September, he was an Unteroffizier. On 1 September 1916, he was commissioned as a Leutnant and placed in command of an artillery unit.Franks et al 1993 p. 97. World War I aerial service On 25 June 1917, Delling transferred to the Luftstreitkr√§fte (German Air Service). He underwent pilot's training at the Bavarian Jastaschule 2 in Furth. Upon graduation, on 16 March 1918 he was posted direct to a fighter squadron, Royal Bavarian Jagdstaffel 34. In accordance with German custom, Delling was allowed to mark his own Albatros D.V, serial numbered D.4483/17. Over the basic silvery white of the fuselage went a light red wash from nose to cockpit, with the same red in a wide band around the fuselage. Wings remained standard five-color lozenge camouflage. The tailplane maintained its stock coloring of green and lavender on top, but the undersides were light blue and the rudder was painted white.Franks 2000, pp. 95-96. Note: An old bullet hole in the reddish band was marked with a cockade and the date 4 April 1918. Delling is also known to have operated a third or fourth hand Fokker Dr.I triplane, though probably without his personal markings.Franks, VanWyngarden 2001, pp. 86-87. Between 6 April and 23 June 1918, Delling was credited with five confirmed aerial victories, but denied confirmation on a sixth credited to an anti-aircraft unit. On 3 August 1918, Delling left combat duty with Jasta 34 because of ill health. He would recoup to fly again as an instructor at Bavaria's Fliegerersatz-Abteilung (Replacement Detachment) 2. Post World War I August Delling survived the war and went on to become a director of the firm of Huecke and Buhren. He died on 17 June 1962 in Battenberg.The Aerodrome website's page on Delling http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/delling.php Retrieved 14 January 2013.

Kormendi (July 24, 1949 ‚Äì February 25, 2009) was an American economist who conducted important research studies in several areas of macroeconomics and finance. A long-time senior member of the Graduate School of Business faculties at the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan, he was the author of over fifty scholarly books and articles. Roger C. Kormendi Biography Early life and education Roger Charles Kormendi was born on July 24, 1949 in New York. He was the only child of his late parents, Andre and Irene Kormendi. He graduated in 1967 from W.T. Woodson High School in Falls Church, Virginia, and in 1971 from the University of Virginia with High Honors in Economics. He earned a Ph.D. in Economics in 1977 from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was a Chancellor‚Äôs Intern Fellow. Career His early work focused on macroeconomic monetary and fiscal policy, and helped to form the current understanding of the effect of deficit spending on economic cycles. Later he founded Mid-America Institute for Public Policy Research while at the University of Chicago, and there he led several cutting-edge research projects in areas of then-current economic or financial crises. Among these were Deregulating Financial Services: Public Policy in Flux in 1986 and Black Monday and the Future of Financial Markets in 1989. The most influential, however, was the Institute‚Äôs publication of Crisis Resolution in the Thrift Industry in 1989, just as Congress was confronting the savings and loan crisis. Its analysis and recommendations were incorporated in many respects both in the legislation passed to address the crisis, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA, and in the policies adopted by the federal agency created by FIRREA, Resolution Trust Corporation, which conducted the thrift clean-up. Dr. Kormendi co-founded Kormendi \\\\ Gardner Partners, known as KGP, a financial advisory firm based in Washington, D.C. At KGP, Dr. Kormendi directed and co- directed many innovative financial engagements for public and private clients. Among these were the first ‚Äúpipeline sale‚Äù public-private partnership for the Department of Defense, the renegotiation of the largest federally assisted acquisition of a failed thrift for the Resolution Trust Corporation (\\"RTC\\"), the first variable equity retained interest transactions (also for RTC), and the first plan for distributing a Sarbanes-Oxley Fair Fund established to compensate investors in variable annuity funds harmed by illegal trading by market timers for the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Dr. Kormendi led the KGP team that advised a private client on its effort to re- capitalize Credit Foncier de France, a historic bank owned by the French government. Marriage and children Kormendi was married three times: first, to the former Paula Stone; second, to Kira Karmazin; third, to Traci Jefferson. He had three sons by his first marriage, Andre, Peter, and Alex. Death and afterward Kormendi died February 25, 2009 at the age of 59 after a long battle with Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease, a degenerative brain disorder.

The Byeokwi sinpyeon was Jun's response to the increasing incursions of Western powers and the threat they posed to Korea. The work went through several versions between the 1840s and the 1880s, each reflecting Yun's changing opinion regarding Westerners and how best to deal with them.

I-5 forms the western boundary. The name is almost never used by local residents as the area is already included in either Rancho Santa Fe or Carmel Valley. The name is almost exclusively used by the San Diego Police Department for zoning.  History  Native American Kumeyaay history within the area has been documented to 7,000 years ago, and was home to a Kumeyaay village (Ahwel-Awa) west of El Camino Real near the San Dieguito River at the time of European contact with the Spanish. The Portol√° expedition in 1769, described it as \\"a large village... and many well built houses with grass roofs\\". The village came under various names during Spanish rule, such as San Jacome De la Marca, La Poza de Ozuna, or most commonly known as San Dieguito (name for the region). Under Mexican administration, the Kumeyaay village was removed to be land granted to Mexican settlers. The village was previously planned to be converted into the San Dieguito pueblo as a village dedicated to the Kumeyaay by Alta California governor Jose Figueroa, but never materialized after his assassination. After the Mexican-American war, the area has been largely used for agricultural and equestrian uses, which was a large producer of strawberries. In the 1993, the City of San Diego designated the area as \\"NCFUA Subarea-II\\" as part of the larger North City Future Urbanizing Area plan which also included what is now Pacific Highlands Ranch, Torrey Highlands, and Black Mountain Ranch. The area has remained under 'Future Urbanizing' status due to the lack of development potential.North City Future Urbanizing Area Framework Plan. https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/legacy//planning/community/profiles/ncfua/pdf/nfcu_final_102314.pdf In the 2000's the strawberry farmlands were converted to preservation land with efforts for environmental restoration as part of the San Dieguito River Park. Several homes and a couple of churches have been constructed since then.

The 386 Generation takes a critical view of the United States and a sympathetic view of North Korea. Etymology The term was coined in the early 1990s, in reference to what was then the latest computer model, Intel's 386, and referring to people then in their 30s, having attended university in the 1980s, and born in the 1960s. As the time flows, the people in 386 generation are called \\"486 Generation\\" in the 2000s and \\"586 Generation\\" in the 2010s. History This was the first generation of South Koreans to grow up free from the poverty that had marked South Korea in the recent past. The broad political mood of the generation was far more left-leaning than that of their parents, or their eventual children. They played a pivotal role in the democratic protests which forced President Chun Doo-hwan to call democratic elections in 1987, marking the transition from military rule to democracy. Members of the 386 generation now comprise much of the elite of South Korean society. Kim Dae-jung benefitted from widespread 386er support, but it is the election of Roh Moo-hyun who was the strongest demonstration of the more left- leaning politics of the generation.

It was previously the terminus of the Furness Railway Ulverston to Lakeside Line, which was closed as part of the Beeching Axe in 1965. It serves the village of Lakeside in Cumbria, as well as the tourist attractions located there. Location Situated at the southern end of Windermere, the station has a direct interchange with the Windermere Lake Cruises ferry services to Ambleside and Bowness-on-Windermere. The station is also located next to the Aquarium of the Lakes and a number of shops and cafes. History Lakeside, Windermere station, 1951. The station was opened to passengers on 2 June 1869 by the Furness Railway when the branch from Plumpton Junction (just off the Leven Viaduct on the to line) to Windermere Lake Side opened, a formal opening of the branch had taken place the day before. Trains were timed to coincide with sailings by the Windermere United Yacht Company from the adjacent pier. Within a few years the railway bought the yacht company. Originally, the station had two platforms with an overall roof, a signal box, turntable and several sidings. The goods yard was able to accommodate most types of goods including live stock and was equipped with a three ton crane. As well as the standard gauge tracks the station had a narrow gauge tramway used for coaling lake steamers. A camping coach was positioned here by the London Midland Region from 1955 to 1957, two coaches were here from 1958 to 1964. The station closed with the line on 6 September 1965. After services stopped, the station fell into disrepair, and in 1978, British Railways removed the roof and demolished the clock tower. British Railways sold off the steamboat service to the Bowness Bay Boating Company who were still operating day trips on Windermere in 2020. The station reopened as part of the heritage Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway in 1973, with trains running to the nearby station of Haverthwaite, roughly an eighteen-minute journey.  Film locations  The station has appeared in a number of film and TV scenes. In many appearances the station is titled 'Windermere', despite Windermere's own railway station being on the other side of the lake, on a different line. * 1973 film of Swallows and Amazons.

Ancient Walled settlements, temples and tombs Ancient cairns in Qa‚Äôableh. Some of the oldest known structures in the territory of modern-day Somalia consist of burial cairns (taalo). Although found throughout the country and the larger Horn of Africa region, northern Somalia in particular is home to numerous such archaeological structures, with many similar edifices found at Haylan, Qa‚Äôableh, Qombo'ul, El Ayo, Damo, Maydh and Heis among other towns. However, many of these ancient structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity. The tomb of Sheikh Isaaq, the founding father of the Isaaq clan, in Maydh, Sanaag. Houses were constructed of dressed stone similar to the ones in Ancient Egypt.Man, God and Civilization pg 216 There are also examples of courtyards and large stone walls enclosing settlements, such as the Wargaade Wall. Sheikh Darod's tomb in the ancient town of Haylaan. Near Bosaso, at the end of the Baladi valley, lies a 2 km to 3 km long earthwork. Local tradition recounts that the massive embankment marks the grave of a community matriarch. It is the largest such structure in the wider Horn region. In addition, old temples situated in the northwestern town of Sheekh are reportedly similar to those in the Deccan Plateau in the Indian subcontinent. There also exist several ancient necropolises in Somalia. One such structured area is found on the country's northeastern tip, in the Hafun peninsula. Booco in the Aluula District contains a number of ancient structures. Two of these are enclosed platform monuments set together, which are surrounded by small stone circles. The circles of stone are believed to mark associated graves. Mudun is situated in the Wadi valley of the Iskushuban District. The area features a number of ruins, which local tradition holds belong to an ancient, large town. Among the old structures are around 2,000 tombs, which possess high towers and are dome- shaped. Port Dunford in the southern Lower Juba province contains a number of ancient ruins, including several pillar tombs. Prior to its collapse, one these structures' pillars stood 11 meters high from the ground, making it the tallest tower of its kind in the wider region. The site is believed to correspond with the ancient emporium of Nikon, which is described in the 1st century CE Greco-Roman travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. In the southern town of Hannassa, ruins of houses with archways and courtyards have been found along with other pillar tombs, including a rare octagonal tomb. Additionally, various pillar tombs exist in the southeastern Marca area. Local tradition holds that these were built in the 16th century, when the Ajuran Sultanate's naa'ibs governed the district. Menhirs and dolmens On the coastal plain 20 km to Alula's east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular dry stone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia. Around 200 stone monuments (taalos) are found in the northeastern Botiala site, most of which consist of cairns. The bigger cairns are covered in shingles and tend to be more sturdily constructed. There are a number of rows of standing stones (menhirs) on the eastern side of the structures, which are similar to those at Salweyn, a great cairn-held situated close to Heis. Besides cairns, the Botiala area also features a few other drystone monuments. These include disc monuments with circular, ground-level features, as well as low, rectangular platform monuments. The northern town of Aw Barkhadle, named in honour of the 13th century scholar and saint Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn (Aw Barkhadle), is surrounded by a number of ancient structures. Among these are menhirs, burial mounds, and dolmens. Stelae Near the ancient northwestern town of Amud, whenever an old site had the prefix Aw in its name (such as the ruins of Awbare and Awbube), it denoted the final resting place of a local saint.G.W.B. Huntingford, \\"The Town of Amud, Somalia\\", Azania, 13 (1978), p. 184 Surveys by A.T. Curle in 1934 on several of these important ruined cities recovered various artefacts, such as pottery and coins, which point to a medieval period of activity at the tail end of the Adal Sultanate's reign. Among these settlements, Aw Barkhadle is surrounded by a number of ancient stelae. Burial sites near Burao likewise feature old stelae. Medieval Ruins of the Sultanate of Adal in Zeila. The introduction of Islam in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought Islamic architectural influences from the Arabian Peninsula and Persia. This stimulated a shift from drystone and other related materials in construction to coral stone, sundried bricks, and the widespread use of limestone in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as mosques were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.102. Stone cities Whitewashed coral stone city of Merca. The lucrative commercial networks of successive medieval Somali kingdoms and city-states such as the Adal Sultanate, Sultanate of Mogadishu, Ajuran Sultanate, and the Sultanate of the Geledi saw the establishment of several dozen stone cities in the interior of Somalia as well as the coastal regions. Ibn Battuta visiting Mogadishu in the early 14th century called it a town endless in sizeThe Archaeology of Islam in Sub Saharan Africa pg 62 and Vasco Da Gama who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its centreDa Gama's First Voyage pg.88 Somali merchants were an integral part of a long distance caravan trade network connecting major Somali cities, such as Mogadishu, Merca, Zeila, Berbera, Bulhar and Barawa, with other business centers in the Horn of Africa. The numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia can be explained as the remains of a once booming inland trade dating back to the medieval period.Shaping of Somali Society - Lee Cassanelli pg.149 Goan Bogame, situated in the Las Anod District, contains the ruins of a large ancient city with around two hundred buildings. The structures were built in an architectural style similar to that of the edifices in Mogadishu's old Hamar Weine and Shangani districts. Castles and fortresses 19th century Martello fort in Berbera constructed by Haji Sharmarke Ali Saleh Throughout the medieval era, castles and fortresses known as Qalcads were built by Somali Sultans for protection against both foreign and domestic threats. The major medieval Somali power engaging in castle building was the Ajuran Sultanate, and many of the hundreds of ruined fortifications dotting the landscapes of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran engineers.Shaping of Somali Society pg 101 Aerial view of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's main fort in Taleh, the capital of his Dervish State. In the year 1845, Haji Sharmarke Ali Saleh seized Berbera, constructed four Martello style forts within the vicinity of the town, and garrisoned each fort with thirty matchlock men. Ruins of the Majeerteen Sultanate King Osman Mahamuud's castle in Bargal, built in 1878. The Dervish State in the late 19th century and early 20th century was another prolific fortress building power in the Somali Peninsula. In 1913, after the British withdrawal to the coast, the permanent capital and headquarters of the Dervishes was constructed at Taleh, a large walled town with fourteen fortresses. The main fortress, Silsilat, included a walled garden and a guard house. It became the residence of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, his wives, family, prominent Somali military leaders, and also hosted several Turkish, Yemeni and German dignitaries, architects, masons and arms manufacturers.Taleh W. A. MacFadyen The Geographical Journal, Vol. 78, No. 2 (Aug., 1931), pp. 125-128 Several dozen other fortresses were built in Illig, Eyl, Shimbiris and other parts of the Horn of Africa. Citadels and city walls The Citadel of Gondershe. City walls were established around the coastal cities of Merca, Barawa and Mogadishu to defend the cities against powers such as the Portuguese Empire. During the Adal Age, many of the inland cities such as Amud and Abasa in the northern part of Somalia were built on hills high above sea level with large defensive stone walls enclosing them. The Bardera militants during their struggle with the Geledi Sultanate had their main headquarters in the walled city of Bardera that was reinforced by a large fortress overseeing the Jubba river. In the early 19th century the citadel of Bardera was sacked by Sultan Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim and the city became a ghost town. Somali city walls also acted as a barrier against the proliferation of arms usually carried by the Somali and Horn African nomads entering the cities with their caravan trains. They had to leave behind their weapons at the city gate before they could enter the markets with their goods and trade with the urban Somalis, Middle Easterners and Asian merchants.Tales which persist on the Tongue - Scott S. Reese pg 4 Mosques and shrines 17th-century mosque in Hafun, Somalia. Concordant with the ancient presence of Islam in the Horn of Africa region, mosques in Somalia are some of the oldest on the entire continent. One architectural feature that made Somali mosques distinct from other mosques in Africa were minarets. 13th century Fakr ad-Din mosque built by Fakr ad-Din, the first Sultan of the Mogadishu Sultanate. For centuries, Arba'a Rukun (1269), the Friday mosque of Merca (1609) and Fakr ad-Din (1269) were, in fact, the only mosques in East Africa to have minarets.Studies in Islamic history and civilization By David Ayalon pg 370 Arba Rukun's massive round coral tower of about 13 and a half meters high and over four meters in diameter at its base has a doorway that is narrow and surrounded by a multiple ordered recessed arch, which may be the first example of the recessed arch that was to become a prototype for the local mihrab style. Constructed by and named after the first Sultan of the Mogadishu Sultanate, the Fakr-ad Din mosque dates back to the 1269. Built with marble and coral stone on a compact rectangular plan, it features a domed mihrab central azis. Glazed tiles were also used in the decoration of the mihrab, one of which bears a dated inscription. In addition, the masjid is characterized by a system of composite beams, alongside two main columns. This well-planned, sophisticated design is not replicated in mosques further south outside the Horn region.Peter S. Garlake, Early art and architecture of Africa, (Oxford University Press US: 2002), p.176. The 13th century Al Gami University consisted of a rectangular base with a large cylindrical tower architecturally unique in the Islamic world. Almnara Tower in Mogadishu. Shrines erected to house and honor Somali patriarchs and forefathers evolved from ancient Somali burial customs. Such tombs, which are predominantly found in northern Somalia (the suggested point of origin of the Somalia's majority Somali ethnic group), feature structures mainly consisting of domes and square plans.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.8. In southern Somalia, the preferred medieval shrine architecture was the pillar tomb-style. A number of ancient burial sites dated from the pre-Islamic period sit atop the peak of Buur Heybe, a granitic inselberg in the southern Doi belt. They serve as a center of annual pilgrimage (siyaro). These burial sites on the mountain's summit were later made into Muslim holy sites in the ensuing Islamic period, including the Owol Qaasing (derived from the Arabic \\"Abul Qaasim\\", one of the names of Prophet Muhammad) and Sheikh Abdulqadir al-Jilaani (named for the founder of the Qadiriyya order). Towers and lighthouses Somalia's historical strategic location within the world's oldest and busiest sealanes encouraged the construction of lighthouses to co-ordinate shipping and to ensure the safe entrance of commercial vessels in the nation's many port cities. In times of weak central authority the Somali civilizational matrix of interior cities and port cities was based on a clan formula that saw various clans in fierce competition over natural resources that led to chronic feuding between neighbours. Towers provided the merchant class and the urban population protection against potential raids from the nomadic regions. Stone towers such as the 15th century Almnara tower in Mogadishu and the Jamia tower of Merca were also built for defence. The Dar Ilalo stone towers though initially constructed to defend the fortress of Taleex were also used as granaries for the Dervish State. Early modern 19th century castle town of Qandala. The early modern period saw a continuation in the use of materials such as coral stone, sundried bricks and limestone in Somali architecture which with the increasing European influence on the Somali peninsula was now being complemented by new construction materials such as cement. The period was characterised by military architecture in the form of multi-purpose forts, and the construction of new ports. The Sultans of Aluula in the northern part of the country and the Geledi Sultanate in the south were at their peak during this period, and many of the castles, palaces and forts found in various Somali cities originate from that era. 1990s to present In the modern period, several Somali cities such as Mogadishu, Hargeisa and Garowe received large projects, which saw construction in new styles that harmoniously blended in with the existing old architecture. Guardafui Lighthouse. Due to Italian influence, parts of Mogadishu are built in the classical style: from the Villa Somalia (official residency of the presidents of Somalia) to the Governor's Palace of Mogadishu] & the \\"Fiat Boero\\" building there are many examples of this architecture, that was developed when Mogadishu was under Italian rule. Other areas of Somalia show the Italian influence, like in the famous lighthouse in Guardafui cape. The Somali government continued upon that legacy, while also opening the door to German, American and Chinese designers. As a departure from the prevailing Somali architectural style, the National Theatre in Mogadishu was completely built from a Chinese perspective. The town-hall was constructed in the Moroccan style. Much of the new architecture also continued upon ancient tradition, the Al-Uruba Hotel, the pre-eminent hotel in Somalia and an iconic feature of Mogadishu's waterfront was entirely designed and constructed by Somalis in the Arabesque style. In recent times, due to the civil war and the subsequent decentralization, many cities across the country have rapidly developed into urban hubs and have adopted their own architectural styles independently. In the cities of Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Berbera and Bosaso, construction firms have built hotels, government facilities, airports and residential neighborhoods in a modernist style, often utilizing chrome, steel and glass materials.

Castle Develstein by Roghman, (1647) Roelant Roghman (14 March 1627 - 3 January 1692) was a Dutch Golden Age painter, sketcher and engraver.RKD - Dutch bureau for art history Biography Roghman was born in Amsterdam, the son of the engraver Henrick Lambertsz Roghman and Maria Jacobs Savery. His mother was a daughter of the Savery family, and Roghman became a student of his namesake and great-uncle, Roelant Savery. According to Houbraken, he only had one eye, but painted in a rough and ready way, that perhaps was the result of his eyesight. He specialized in landscapes, and in later life became a history buff, working on several prints of old castle ruins and defunct family estates based on drawings he made during travels in his youth. He was a follower of Rembrandt and Hercules Seghers. Houbraken claimed that in his youth he had been a friend of Rembrandt and Gerbrant van den Eekhout.Roelant Rogman biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Roghman worked on one of his print series with his sister Geertruydt in (ca. 1645-1648), under the title Plaisante Landschappen (pleasant landscapes) by the printer Claes Jansz Visscher. His other sister Magdalena was also an engraver. Their landscape series of more than 200 prints, showing mostly castles and landed estates in the Dutch provinces of North Holland and Utrecht, were very popular. He never married, and died a resident of the old men's almshouse in Amsterdam. Aside from his sisters, he was the teacher of Jan Griffier and Pieter Wouwerman.

On 1 July he was granted the Royal Aero Club Aviators Certificate No. 1379 after flying a Grahame-White biplane at the Grahame-White Flying School at Hendon Aerodrome, and was confirmed in his rank on 26 October. De Roeper was first assigned to an RNAS Coastal Air Station based at Redcar, Yorkshire flying coastal defence and anti-Zeppelin patrols.Shores et.al. (1997), p.139. He was involved in two separate crashes in 1916, both at Redcar; firstly a forced landing in a Caudron G.3 on 20 February, and then in a B.E.2c just after midnight on 3 May, while returning from a patrol, when he struck a searchlight on landing. From there, he was posted to No. 6 Squadron RNAS, where he flew a Nieuport Scout. On 3 December 1916 he was appointed Acting Flight Commander. On 20 May 1917, he scored his first victory, driving down an Albatros two-seater out of control north-west of Bohain. Five days later, on 25 May, he swooped down on a German two-seater, only to be wounded in the jaw by the observer. The wound kept de Roeper out of action until July. As he recuperated, on 4 April he was promoted Flight Lieutenant and the squadron converted to Sopwith Camels. Between 22 July and 20 August 1917, he drove down four more enemy aircraft out of control. He was then assigned to instructor duty, which he carried out for the rest of the war. In the New Years Honours list he was promoted to Squadron Commander, effective from 1 January 1918. De Roeper was awarded the Air Force Cross while based in Egypt in May 1919. Inter-war career On 1 August 1919 de Roeper received a full Royal Air Force commission in the rank of Major (later converted to Squadron Leader), and the following day at Romford married Jean Julia Key, of Upminster, Essex. He then served at the Central Flying School at RAF Upavon, before being transferred to the School of Photography at RAF Farnborough on 15 August 1921, and finally to No. 1 Flying Training School at RAF Netheravon on 20 March 1922. On 14 November 1924 de Roeper was proposed by William James Stewart Lockyer to be a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. On 16 December 1924 he was appointed to the Aeronautical Committee of Guarantee in Germany. This was the successor to the Military Commission of Control, tasked with the post-war oversight of Germany's industrial production. On 11 March 1925 he was posted to No. 1 RAF Depot at RAF Uxbridge, and on 16 April, de Roeper left regular Royal Air Force service, being placed on the retired list. De Roeper maintained his interests in aviation, requalifying as a pilot in 1931, being granted Aviators Certificate No. 10158 at Brooklands Flying School in November, and working in the aircraft industry. By April 1939 he was a business manager for Rootes when the Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood visited Rootes' shadow factory at Speke Aerodrome that was then building the Bristol Blenheim. World War II De Roeper rejoined the Royal Air Force in the rank of Squadron Leader during World War II, being transferred from the General Duties to the Technical Branch on 24 April 1940. He was promoted to Wing Commander on 1 January 1944, and later to Temporary Group Captain, this being made war substantive on 24 March 1945. On 3 March 1946 de Roeper returned to the retired list at his own request, retaining the rank of Group Captain.

The Anderton Power Loader with its cutting drum up to five feet in diameter was patented in 1953. It was successfully used throughout the British coalfields and by 1966 cut half the coal produced and by 1977 it produced 80% of the coal mined in Britain. The Shearer Loader was mainly developed by James Anderton OBE, who was the National Coal Board (St Helens Area) production manager and later chairman of the NCB's North-Western Division. The first Anderton shearer loader was commissioned in 1954. It was utilised by Anderton's employers at Groves Ravenhead Colliery in St Helens. The machine works by \\"shearing\\" coal from a longwall coal face as it moved along the face. The shear drum is around 0.5 metres in diameter and the machine travels on an armoured conveyor with a prop-free front. The machine shears going one way and the coal at the front is deflected by a plough onto the conveyor. On the machine's return it knocks the rest of the coal onto the conveyor. The Shearer was usually used on seams thicker than a metreCoal Mining in The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition Copyright, 2004, Columbia University Press and produced small coal suitable for power stations.

Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 160.) was fought between the Roman and Parthian Empires over Armenia and Upper Mesopotamia. It concluded in 166 after the Romans made successful campaigns into lower Mesopotamia and Media and sacked Ctesiphon, a Parthian capital. Origins to Lucius' dispatch, 161-162 On his deathbed in the spring of 161, Emperor Antoninus Pius had spoken of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him.HA Pius 12.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114, 121. One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late summer or early autumn 161.Event: HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. Date: Jaap-Jan Flinterman, \\"The Date of Lucian's Visit to Abonuteichos,\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 119 (1997): 281. Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled its king and installed his own‚ÄîPacorus, an Arsacid like himself.HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. At the time of the invasion, the governor of Syria was Lucius Attidius Cornelianus. Attidius had been retained as governor even though his term ended in 161, presumably to avoid giving the Parthians the chance to wrong-foot his replacement. The governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters. But living in the east had a deleterious effect on his character.Lucian, Alexander 27; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. The confidence man Alexander of Abonutichus, a prophet who carried a snake named Glycon around with him, had enraptured Severianus, as he had many others.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. On Alexander, see: Robin Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), 241-50. Father-in-law to the respected senator Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus, then-proconsul of Asia, Abonutichus was friends with many members of the east Roman elite.Lucian, Alexander 30; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121. Alexander convinced Severianus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself.Lucian, Alexander 27; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121-22. Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX HispanaBirley, Marcus Aurelius, 278 n.19.) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegeia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.Dio 71.2.1; Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 21, 24, 25; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 121-22.

Marcus Aurelius, who had become emperor on Pius' death on 7 March 161, was unprepared. Pius seems to have given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Pius' twenty-three-year reign at the emperor's side‚Äîand not in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early careers.HA Pius 7.11; Marcus 7.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 103-4, 122. Marcus made the necessary appointments: Marcus Statius Priscus, the governor of Britain, was sent to replace Severianus as governor of Cappadocia,Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, citing A.R. Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (1981), 123ff. and was in turn replaced by Sextus Calpurnius Agricola.HA Marcus 8.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, citing W. Eck, Die Satthalter der germ. Provinzen (1985), 65ff. More bad news arrived: Attidius Cornelianus' army had been defeated in battle against the Parthians, and retreated in disarray.HA Marcus 8.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. Publius Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with vexillations from the Danubian legions.Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum 8.7050 -51 ; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Three full legions were also sent east: I Minervia from Bonn in Upper Germany,Incriptiones Latinae Selectae 1097 -98 ; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. II Adiutrix from Aquincum,Incriptiones Latinae Selectae 1091 ; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. and V Macedonica from Troesmis.Incriptiones Latinae Selectae 2311 ; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. The northern frontiers were strategically weakened; frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible.HA Marcus 12.13; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Attidius Cornelianus himself was replaced by M. Annius Libo, Marcus' first cousin. He was young‚Äîhis first consulship was in 161, so he was probably in his early thirtiesL'Ann√©e √âpigraphique 1972.657 ; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125.‚Äîand, as a mere patrician, lacked military experience. Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.HA Verus 9.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125. Marcus took a four-day public holiday at Alsium, a resort town on the Etrurian coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to his former tutor Marcus Cornelius Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday.De Feriis Alsiensibus 1 (= Haines 2.3); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126. Fronto replied ironically: \\"What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?\\"De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.1 (= Haines 2.5), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126. He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy),De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.4 (= Haines 2.9); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126-27. going so far as to write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening‚ÄîMarcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of leisure.De Feriis Alsiensibus 3.6-12 (= Haines 2.11-19); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126-27. Marcus could not take Fronto's advice. \\"I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,\\" he wrote back.De Feriis Alsiensibus 4, tr. Haines 2.19; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. Marcus put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: \\"'Much good has my advice done you', you will say!\\" He had rested, and would rest often, but \\"‚Äîthis devotion to duty! Who knows better than you how demanding it is!\\"De Feriis Alsiensibus 4 (= Haines 2.19), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material, including Cicero's pro lege Manilia, in which the orator had argued in favor of Pompey taking supreme command in the Mithridatic War. It was an apt reference (Pompey's war had taken him to Armenia), and may have had some impact on the decision to send Lucius to the eastern front.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. \\"You will find in it many chapters aptly suited to your present counsels, concerning the choice of army commanders, the interests of allies, the protection of provinces, the discipline of the soldiers, the qualifications required for commanders in the field and elsewhere [...]\\"De bello Parthico 10 (= Haines 2.31), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. To settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, Fronto wrote Marcus a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled De bello Parthico (On the Parthian War). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes, at Allia, at Caudium, at Cannae, at Numantia, Cirta, and Carrhae;De bello Parthico 1 (= Haines 2.21). under Trajan, Hadrian, and Pius;De bello Parthico 2 (= Haines 2.21-23); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: \\"always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs\\".De bello Parthico 1 (= Haines 2.21), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. Lucius' dispatch and journey east, 162-163? Over the winter of 161-62, as more bad news arrived‚Äîa rebellion was brewing in Syria‚Äîit was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity.Dio 71.1.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Lucius' biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius' debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, to realize that he was an emperor.HA Verus 5.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123, 125. Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city \\"demanded the presence of an emperor\\".HA Marcus 8.9, tr. Magie; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 123. Titus Furius Victorinus, one of the two praetorian prefects, was sent with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, Marcus Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus and Marcus Iallius Bassus, and a detachment of the Praetorian Guard. Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia, giving him some experience with eastern affairs.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125, citing H.G. Pfalum, Les carri√®res procuratoriennes √©questres sous le Haut-Empire romain I‚ÄìIII (Paris, 1960‚Äì61); Suppl√©ment (Paris, 1982), no. 139. Moreover, he was far more qualified than his praetorian partner, Sextus Cornelius Repentinus, who was said to owe his office to the influence of Pius' mistress Galeria Lysistrate.HA Pius 8.9; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 160-61. Repentius had the rank of a senator, but no real access to senatorial circles‚Äîhis was merely a decorative title.Giuseppe Camodeca, \\"La carriera del prefetto del pretorio Sex.Cornelius Repentinus in una nuova iscrizione puteolana\\" (in Italian), Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 43 (1981): 47. Since a prefect had to accompany the Guard, Victorinus was the clear choice. Laelianus had been governor of both Pannonias and governor of Syria in 153; hence he had first-hand knowledge of the eastern army and military strategy on the frontiers. He was made comes Augustorum (\\"companion of the emperors\\") for his service.Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 1094, 1100; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125. Laelianus was, in the words of Fronto, \\"a serious man and an old- fashioned disciplinarian\\".Ad Verum Imperator 2.6 (= Haines 2.84ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125. Bassus had been governor of Lower Moesia, and was also made comes.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 1.4. Lucius selected his favorite freedmen, including Geminus, Agaclytus, Coedes, Eclectus,HA Verus 8.6, 9.3-5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125. and Nicomedes, who gave up his duties as praefectus vehiculorum to run the commissariat of the expeditionary force.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125, citing H.G. Pfalum, Les carri√®res procuratoriennes √©questres sous le Haut-Empire romain I‚ÄìIII (Paris, 1960‚Äì61); Suppl√©ment (Paris, 1982), no. 163. The fleet of Misenum was charged with transporting the emperor and general communications and transport.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125, citing C.G. Starr, The Roman Imperial Navy, (1941), 188ff. Lucius left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium; Marcus followed him as far as Capua. Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route, and hunted at Apulia. He fell ill at Canosa, probably afflicted with a mild stroke, and took to bed.HA Verus 6.7-9; HA Marcus 8.10-11; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125-6\\\\. Stroke: Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126; Haines 2.85 n. 1. Marcus made prayers to the gods for his safety in front of the senate, and hurried south to see him.HA Marcus 8.11; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125-26. Fronto was upset at the news, but was reassured when Lucius sent him a letter describing his treatment and recovery. In his reply, Fronto urged his pupil to moderate his desires, and recommended a few days of quiet bedrest. Lucius was better after three days' fasting and a bloodletting. It was probably only a mild stroke.Ad Verum Imperator 2.6 (= Haines 2.85-87); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 125-26. Verus continued eastward via Corinth and Athens, accompanied by musicians and singers as if in a royal progress.HA Verus 6.9; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 161. At Athens he stayed with Herodes Atticus, and joined the Eleusinian Mysteries.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126, citing SIG3 1.869, 872; HA Hadrian 13.1. During sacrifice, a falling star was observed in the sky, shooting west to east.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126, citing Cassiodorus senator s.a. 162. He stopped in Ephesus, where he is attested at the estate of the local aristocrat Publius Vedius Antoninus,Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 161, citing I Eph 728, 3072; H. Halfmann, Itinera Principum. Geschichte und Typologie der Kaiserreisen im R√∂mischen Reich (Stuttgart, 1986), 210-11. and made an unexpected stopover at Erythrae, where an elegiac poem in the voice of the local sibyl alludes to his visit.Christian Habicht, \\"Pausanias and the Evidence of Inscriptions\\", Classical Antiquity 3:1 (1984), 42-43, citing IErythrai 225. The journey continued by ship through the Aegean and the southern coasts of Asia Minor, lingering in the famed pleasure resorts of Pamphylia and Cilicia, before arriving in Antioch.HA Verus 6.9; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126. It is not known how long Verus' journey east took; he might not have arrived in Antioch until after 162.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 161. Statius Priscus, meanwhile, must have already arrived in Cappadocia; he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship.Dio 71.3.1; HA Verus 7.1; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 126. Dissipation and logistics at Antioch, 162?-165 William Miller after a drawing by H. Warren from a sketch by Captain Byam Martin, R.N., 1866) Lucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at LaodiceaHistoria Augusta Life of Lucius Verus 7 and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. He took up a mistress named Panthea, from Smyrna.Smyrna: Lucian, Imagines 2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. The biographer calls her a \\"low-born girl-friend\\",HA Verus 7.10, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. but she is probably closer to Lucian's \\"woman of perfect beauty\\", more beautiful than any of Phidias and Praxiteles' statues.Lucian, Imagines 3, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. Polite, caring, humble, she sang to the lyre perfectly and spoke clear Ionic Greek, spiced with Attic wit.Lucian, Imagines 11, 14-15; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. Panthea read Lucian's first draft, and criticized him for flattery. He had compared her to a goddess, which frightened her‚Äîshe did not want to become the next Cassiopeia.Lucian, Pro Imaginibus 7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. She had power, too. She made Lucius shave his beard for her. The Syrians mocked him for this, as they did for much else.HA Verus 7.10, cf. 7.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. Critics declaimed Lucius' luxurious lifestyle.HA Verus 4.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. He had taken to gambling, they said; he would \\"dice the whole night through\\".HA Verus 4.6, tr. Magie; cf. 5.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. He enjoyed the company of actors.HA Verus 8.7, 8.10-11; Fronto, Principae Historia 17 (= Haines 2.217); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. He made a special request for dispatches from Rome, to keep him updated on how his chariot teams were doing.HA Verus 6.1; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. He brought a golden statue of the Greens' horse Volucer around with him, as a token of his team spirit.HA Verus 6.3-4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. Fronto defended his pupil against some of these claims: the Roman people needed Lucius' bread and circuses to keep them in check.Principae Historiae 17 (= Haines 2.216-17); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. This, at least, is how the biographer has it. The whole section of the vita dealing with Lucius' debaucheries (HA Verus 4.4-6.6) is an insertion into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source. Some few passages seem genuine; others take and elaborate something from the original. The rest is by the biographer himself, relying on nothing better than his own imagination.Barnes, 69. Lucius faced quite a task. Fronto described the scene in terms recalling Corbulo's arrival one hundred years before.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. The Syrian army had turned soft during the east's long peace. They spent more time at the city's open-air bars than in their quarters. Under Lucius, training was stepped up. Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped of their padding. Gambling and drinking were sternly policed.Ad Verum Imperator 2.1.19 (= Haines 2.148-49); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129. Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head of his army as often as on horseback. He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp, including the sick bay.Principae Historia 13 (= Haines 2.209-11); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129-30. Lucius sent Fronto few messages at the beginning of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day, he wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his work: \\"not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish to invite you to share in the joy\\".Ad Verum Imperator 2.2 (= Haines 2.117), tr. Haines; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night.Ad Verum Imperator 2.2 (= Haines 2.117-19); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. One reason for Lucius' reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius' presentation of terms was seen as cowardice.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130; citing Panegyrici Latini 14(10).6. The Parthians were not in the mood for peace.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. Lucius needed to make extensive imports into Antioch, so he opened a sailing route up the Orontes. Because the river breaks across a cliff before reaching the city, Lucius ordered that a new canal be dug. After the project was completed, the Orontes' old riverbed dried up, exposing massive bones‚Äîthe bones of a giant. Pausanias says they were from a beast \\"more than eleven cubits\\" tall; Philostratus says the it was \\"thirty cubits\\" tall. The oracle at Claros declared that they were the bones of the river's spirit.Pausanias 8.29.3-4; Philostratus, Heroicus 138.6-9 K., 9.5-7 L.; Christopher Jones, \\"The Emperor and the Giant\\", Classical Philology 95:4 (2000): 476-81. In the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus' daughter Lucilla.HA Verus 7.7; Marcus 9.4; Barnes, 72; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 163; cf. also Barnes, \\"Legislation Against the Christians\\", Journal of Roman Studies 58:1-2 (1968), 39; \\"Some Persons in the Historia Augusta\\", Phoenix 26:2 (1972), 142, citing the Vita Abercii 44ff. Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 163. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and Marcus Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father.HA Verus 7.7; Marcus 9.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131. Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen.HA Verus 7.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131. Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east.HA Marcus 9.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131. Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception.HA Marcus 9.5-6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131. Lucilla would bear three of Lucius' children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 163. Counterattack and victory, 163-166 The Legions I Minervia, commanded by M. Claudius Fronto and V Macedonica, commanded by P. Martius Verus, served under Marcus Statius Priscus in Armenia, achieving success during the campaign season of 163,Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 161-62, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 C 874 (Claudius Fronto); Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 348. culminating with the capture of the Armenian capital Artaxata.HA Marcus 9.1; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. At the end of the year, Verus took the title Armeniacus, despite having never seen combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year.HA Marcus 9.1; HA Verus 7.1-2; Ad Verrum Imperator 2.3 (= Haines 2.133); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. When Lucius was hailed as imperator again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the title Imperator II with him.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 129; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 233ff. The army of Syria was reinforced by II Adiutrix and Danubian legions under X Gemina's legate Geminius Marcianus.Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 8977 (II Adiutrix); Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum 8.7050 -51 (Marcianus); Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. The Euphrates river near Raqqa, Syria Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164, a new capital, Kaine Polis (\\"New City\\" in Greek), replaced Artaxata.Dio 71.3.1; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162; Millar, Near East, 113. On Birley's reckoning, it was thirty miles closer to the Roman border. Detachments from Cappadocian legions are attested at Echmiadzin, beneath the southern face of Mount Ararat, 400 km east of Satala. It would have meant a march of twenty days or more, through mountainous terrain, from the Roman border; a \\"remarkable example of imperialism\\", in the words of Fergus Millar.Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 394; 9117; Millar, Near East, 113. A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, C. Iulius Sohaemus. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 280 n. 42; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend : Verus sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus stood before him, saluting the emperor.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 131; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 261ff.; 300 ff. In 163, while Statius Priscus was occupied in Armenia, the Parthians intervened in Osroene, a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia, just east of Syria, with its capital at Edessa. They deposed the country's leader, Mannus, and replaced him with their own nominee, who would remain in office until 165.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130, 279 n. 38; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 163, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 169. (The Edessene coinage record actually begins at this point, with issues showing Vologases IV on the obverse and \\"Wael the king\\" (Syriac: W'L MLK') on the reverse.Millar, Near East, 112.) In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point. On the evidence of Lucian, the Parthians still held the southern, Roman bank of the Euphrates (in Syria) as late as 163 (he refers to a battle at Sura, which is on the southern side of the river).Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 29; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. Before the end of the year, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank.Fronto, Ad Verum Imperator 2.1.3 (= Haines 2.133); Astarita, 41; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 162. Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town south-west of Edessa.Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 1098 ; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130. There was little movement in 164; most of the year was spent on preparations for a renewed assault on Parthian territory. In 165, Roman forces, perhaps led by Martius Verus and the V Macedonica, moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, Mannus re-installed.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 163, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 169. His coinage resumed, too: 'Ma'nu the king' (Syriac: M'NW MLK') or Antonine dynasts on the obverse, and 'King Mannos, friend of the Romans' (Greek: Basileus Mannos Philor≈çmaios) on the reverse. The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris; their general Chosrhoes swam down the river and made his hideout in a cave.Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 15, 19; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 163. A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura-Europos.Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 20, 28; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 163, citing Syme, Roman Papers, 5.689ff. By the end of 165, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid Empire, one of Alexander the Great's successor kingdoms), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version (promulgated, according to the Historia Augusta, by Asinius Quadratus) had it that the Seleuceni broke faith first.HA Verus 8.3-4; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 163. Birley cites R.H. McDowell, Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1935), 124ff., on the date. Whatever the case, the sacking marks a particularly destructive chapter in Seleucia's long decline.John F. Matthews, The Roman Empire of Ammianus (London: Duckworth, 1989), 142-43. During the sacking, Roman troops stole the statue of Apollo Comaeus from its temple and brought it back to Rome, where it was installed at the temple of the Palatine Apollo.Ammianus 23.6.23-24; McLynn, 334-35. This blasphemy may have been on Marcus' mind when he called a lectisternium, a great meal offered to the gods, at the beginning of the Marcomannic Wars (ca. 167) to ward off the evils then being visited on the state.HA Marcus 13.1-6; McLynn, 334-35. Cassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague, contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 164. 31 July 2010 Iunius Maximus, a young tribunus laticlavius serving in III Gallica under Cassius, took the news of the victory to Rome. Maximus received a generous cash bounty (dona) for bringing the good news, and immediate promotion to the quaestorship.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 164, citing Alf√∂ldy and Halfmann, \\"Iunius Mauricus und die Victoria Parthica\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 35 (1979): 195-212 = Alf√∂ldy, R√∂mische Heeresgeschichte. Beitr√§ge 1962‚Äì1985 (Amsterdam, 1987), 203 ff (with addenda, 220‚Äì1); Fronto, Ad amicos 1.6. Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as imperatores again, earning the title Imp. III.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 164, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 384 ff., 1248 ff., 1271 ff. Cassius' army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title Medicus,Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 164, citing P. Kneissl, Die Siegestitulatur der r√∂mischen Kaiser. Untersuchungen zu den Siegerbeinamen des 1. und 2. Jahrhunderts (G√∂ttingen, 1969), 99 ff. and the emperors were again hailed as imperatores, becoming Imp. IV in imperial titulature. Marcus too took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 164, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 401ff. Conclusion of the war, mid-160s-167 Lucius Verus' apotheosis from Ephesus (today in Ephesos Museum in Wien). Most of the credit for the war's success must be ascribed to subordinate generals. The forces that advanced on Osroene were led by M. Claudius Fronto, an Asian provincial of Greek descent who had led I Minervia in Armenia under Priscus. He was probably the first senator in his family.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 C 874. Fronto was consul for 165, probably in honor of the capture of Edessa. Claudius Fronto returned to Italy for his consulship; the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Julius Verus, also returned.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 164, citing Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat, 179 ff. Publius Martius Verus had led V Macedonica to the front, and also served under Priscus. Martius Verus was a westerner, whose patria was perhaps Tolosa in Gallia Narbonensis.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 348. The most prominent general, however, was C. Avidius Cassius, commander of III Gallica, one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was young senator, the son of Gaius Avidius Heliodorus, a noted orator who was augustal prefect of Egypt from 137 to 142 AD under Hadrian, and wife Junia Cassia Alexandria. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the Seleucid kings and the Julio-Claudians through his mother Junia Cassia who descended from Julia, daughter and only child of Augustus.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 130, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 A 1402f.; 1405; Astarita, passim; Syme, Bonner Historia-Augustia Colloquia 1984 (= Roman Papers IV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), ?). Cassius and Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166. After their consulships, they were made governors: Cassius, of Syria; Martius Verus, of Cappadocia.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 164, citing Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat, 24, 221. On the return from the campaign, Lucius was awarded with a triumph; the parade was unusual because it included the two emperors, their sons and unmarried daughters as a big family celebration. Marcus Aurelius' two sons, Commodus five years old and Marcus Annius Verus of three, were elevated to the status of Caesar for the occasion. A statue base survives in Sardis to commemorate Lucius' victory (the emperor had presumably visited the city on his return to Rome).Sherman E. Johnson, \\"Preliminary Epigraphic Report on the Inscriptions Found at Sardis in 1958\\", Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 158 (1960): 6-11. The wealthy sophist T. Flavius Damianus also hosted the emperor and his army during their return trip.Elizabeth Grier, \\"Certain Rich Men of the Second Century after Christ\\", Classical Weekly 23:15 (1930): 114, citing Forschungen in Ephesos, Ver√∂ffentlicht vom Oesterreichischen Arch√§eologischen Institut (Vienna, H√∂lder, 1906-23) 3.161 n. 80. Nisibis on the upper Euphrates remained in Roman hands for several decades after the end of the war. By the mid-3rd century, when it was frequently contested by and exchanged between Persia and Rome, it had taken on the appearances of a typical Roman garrison town.C.S. Lightfoot, \\"Facts and Fiction: The Third Siege of Nisibis (A.D. 350)\\", Historia 37:1 (1988): 106-7.

He had a curacy at Maldonado, Uruguay during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, and returned to Buenos Aires in time to take part in the May Revolution of 1810. He was chosen as one of the seven members of the Primera Junta, considered the first national government of Argentina. He supported most of the proposals of Mariano Moreno and worked at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper. The internal disputes of the Junta had a negative effect on his health, and he died of a heart attack in 1811. Biography Colonial times Manuel Alberti was born in Buenos Aires on 28 May 1763 to Antonio Alberti and Juana Agustina Mar√≠n. He was baptized on the following 1 June at the Concepci√≥n parish; his godparents were Juan Javier Dogan and Isabel de Soria y Santa Cruz. He had three brothers, Isidoro, Manuel Silvestre and F√©lix, and three sisters, Casimira, Juana Mar√≠a and Mar√≠a Clotilde. The Alberti family became benefactor of the House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires by donating them a land plot so it could move its headquarters.National... pp. 3031 He made his first studies at the Real Colegio de San Carlos in February 1777, graduating in philosophy, logic, physics and metaphysics. He studied with Hip√≥lito Vieytes, and ended his secondary education on 17 February 1779. He moved to C√≥rdoba the following year, to get university studies of theology at the National University of C√≥rdoba. Despite a brief return to Buenos Aires during his second year because of health problems, he could finish all the syllabus. He got his doctorate in theology and physics on 16 July 1785. He got his degree at the Church of the Company from interim provost Fray Pedro Gait√°n.National... p. 31 He received the presbyterate in the first months of 1786, and was appointed for the Concepci√≥n parish, the same one where he was baptized. He also worked at the aforementioned House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires. He got the curacy of Magdalena on 12 September 1790, but resigned a year later because of health problems. He returned in 1793, and resigned definitively on 21 February 1794. After this, he moved to Maldonado. There are few historical records of his activities in those curacies.National... p. 32 The territory fell briefly under British rule during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata. There was looting after the failed resistance, and Alberti hid all the valuable things from the half-built parish. In defiance of the new British rule, Alberti gave medical aid to the Spanish soldiers and Catholic burials to the deceased, and mailed the Spanish forces with details about the British troops located in the city.Balmaceda, p. 38 As a result, he was jailed. He was released by the British Juan Jaime Backhouse in order to restore religious practices (the invaders did not attempt to enforce Protestantism in the population), but under military escort.National... p. 33 The British would be defeated by Santiago de Liniers, and driven away from the viceroyalty. Primera Junta He returned to Buenos Aires in 1808, and got the curacy of San Benito de Palermo. This was supposed to be a new jurisdiction split from the one of San Nicol√°s de Bari, but such change was never enforced, so he was actually in charge of both. He became involved with politics as well, joining the groups of Miguel de Azcu√©naga and Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a. Those groups sought to generate great political and social changes, and would lead to the May Revolution. He was selected to take part in the open cabildo celebrated on 22 May to decide the fate of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, as well as other twenty-seven ecclesiastics. He was among the nineteen that voted for the removal of the viceroy, supporting the proposal of Cornelio Saavedra. He also supported Juan Nepomuceno Sol√° and Ram√≥n Vieytes, who proposed the calling of deputies from the other cities of the viceroyalty.National... pp. 33‚Äì34 Lithograph of the members of the Primera Junta. His brother Manuel Silvestre Alberti signed the popular petition formulated on 25 May that aimed to draft the composition of the Primera Junta that would replace Cisneros in power.Balmaceda, p. 39 On that day Alberti moved to Azcu√©naga's house and from it he observed the events in the plaza, along with many other patriots gathered there. He was there when he came to know that he was chosen as a member of the new Junta. The reasons of Alberti's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists,Luna, p. 39 and Alberti in particular may have been elected to serve as chaplain of the government.National... pp. 34‚Äì35 In the Junta, Alberti was aligned with most of the reformist proposals of Mariano Moreno, as well as Juan Larrea and Juan Jos√© Castelli.National... p. 35 He signed most of the rulings that shaped the new political system, such as those related to popular sovereignty, representative and republican principles, separation of powers, publicity of the government actions, freedom of speech and the bases of political federalism. However, he did not support the actions of the Junta that contradicted his religious formation, regardless of the context.National... p. 36 He refused to sign the death penalty for Santiago de Liniers, captured after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He signed the harsh commands given to Castelli for the first Upper Peru campaign, but noticing next to his signature that he made an exception with the articles involving capital punishment. He was also concerned by the role of the church in the new political system and headed a dispute against the Cabildo about it. He considered that the Cabildo should not have any authority over the Junta in ecclesiastic topics, to prevent the former abuses of the absolutist governments.National... pp. 35‚Äì36 Manuel Alberti worked in journalism as well, at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper created by the Junta. The ruling that created this newspaper gave Alberti the duty of selecting the news reports to publish. This duty was exclusive of Alberti and not shared with the other members of the Junta. Some historians also consider that Alberti may be the real author of the newspaper's editorials, as they were not signed and the style is not similar to other reports by Mariano Moreno, who is usually considered the author.National... pp. 36‚Äì37 The first conflict between Alberti and Moreno was caused by the arrival of Gregorio Funes, dean of C√≥rdoba with similar ideas to those of Cornelio Saavedra, president of the Junta. Moreno was keeping an internal dispute with Saavedra, and expected Alberti to write against Funes. He did not, and Moreno made harsh comments about it.National... p. 37 Alberti would be further distanced from Moreno when the Junta voted for the incorporation of the deputies from other cities into the Junta. At first, both of them opposed the proposal, but Alberti ultimately voted accepting it, stating that he did so just out of political convenience. The Primera Junta was thus turned into the Junta Grande. Mariano Moreno, left in a minority group, resigned. The inclusion of new deputies increased disputes within the Junta. He opposed both Saavedra and Funes, albeit in a more moderate manner than Moreno. Those fights affected his health, and he had a mild heart attack on 28 January 1811.Balmaceda, p. 40 Fearing for his life, he wrote his will and received the Anointing of the Sick. Three days later he had another strong disagreement with Funes, and had another heart attack when he was returning to his house. He was buried in the cemetery of San Nicol√°s de Bari, as requested in his will. The death certificate states that he had not been given last rites because his unanticipated death did not allow for time. Alberti was the first member of the Primera Junta to die.National... p. 38 Commemoration Barrancas de Belgrano. All members of the Junta Grande assisted to Alberti's funeral, even his political enemy Gregorio Funes. Domingo Matheu was the most affected one by his death, to the point of crying for it. Alberti was replaced in the Junta by Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a, a decided morenist. Saavedra and Funes did not like him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination. Alberti requested in his will to avoid pageantry or complex funerals, and inherited his properties (house, farm, furniture, slaves, clothing, books, etc.) to his siblings Juana Mar√≠a, Matilde, Casimira and Manuel Silvestre. His personal diaries are kept, but with some parts of them being lost due to poor keeping. Still, his personal bibliography is used by historians to reconstruct his influences and ideological background. It included many works of theology, studies of the Bible, scholastic theologists and juridical studies. Alberti's remains were lost when the chapel was demolished to make way for an expansion of 9 de Julio Avenue. The government of Buenos Aires name a street in his honor in 1822. In 1910, during the Argentina Centennial, a statue of him was erected in Barrancas de Belgrano, a neighborhood at the north of Buenos Aires. The district of Manuel Alberti, in Buenos Aires Province, is also named after him.

It is also associated with the BaSotho prophetess Mantsopa, while the ‚Äòsacred landscape‚Äô in the vicinity includes San rock painting sites.. Prepared for the Free State Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in connection with site worthy of consideration for World Heritage Sites status. St Augustine‚Äôs Bishop Twells of Bloemfontein purchased the farms Modderpoort and Modderpoort Spruit in 1865 as a base for missionary work in the area. The property was situated within the so-called ‚ÄòConquered Territory‚Äô lost by the BaSotho through conquest in the years 1843-1869. It was in fact not before 1869 that Canon Henry Beckett, the Superior of the Society of St Augustine, accompanied by four brothers, set up the mission, initially in a cave converted as church and dwelling. In 1871 the Priory was built while the sandstone Chapel, badly damaged in a mountain fire, was enlarged and rededicated in 1903. Meanwhile Modderpoort had been taken over, in 1902, by the Anglican Society of the Sacred Mission (SSM). Alongside the Priory is the cemetery, containing inter alia the graves of the Anglican Brothers who served at Modderpoort. Their graves are capped with beautifully carved sandstone which was quarried from the surrounding hills (the sandstone for the Union Buildings in Pretoria came from the same source). The sparrow that features in some of the carvings has reference to St Matthew 10:29-30. By 1928, the SSM had established a School and a Training College for black teachers. Both these institutions were closed down in 1955, however, following the introduction of Apartheid and the implementation of the Bantu Education Act of 1953. Alumni from Modderpoort include Winkie Direko, a Premier of the Free State Province. St Augustine‚Äôs operated subsequently as a Conference and Synod Centre and today includes Bed & Breakfast facilities. Mantsopa In the cemetery alongside the Priory lie the remains, besides those of missionary brothers and other former residents, of the legendary BaSotho prophetess Mantsopa, who died here on 11 November 1906. Makhetha Mantsopa was born in the region in about 1795. In 1851 she predicted that the BaSotho would triumph over colonial troops led by Major Warden. Renowned amongst her people for her seeing into the future and communicating with the ancestors, she was recognized instantly as a prophetess. Legend has it that over the years her influence became a threat to the power of the Basotho King Moshoeshoe. So it is said, Matsopa fled, finding refuge in the valley of Modderpoort. Here she was Christianised, baptized on 13 March 1870, and taking the name Anna. (Moshoeshoe was to have been baptized on the same day, but died two days previously). Mantsopa, it is suggested, practised a combination of Christian and traditional African rites which probably anticipated those of the modern Zionist Christian Church. Her memory is revered to this day, with Modderpoort becoming a site of pilgrimage in recent years, when offerings are sometimes placed at her grave or in the nearby Cave Church. Particularly, a sacred spring of fresh water at Modderpoort is associated with the Matsopa cult. Pilgrims collect ‚ÄúMatsopa Water‚Äù (now bottled) from the sacred spring, well regarded for its healing qualities. Coplan indicates that these rites are but a part of a larger phenomenon of re-occupation, by re-use, of heritage and ritual sites in the Free State-Lesotho frontier. He notes that ‚ÄúPilgrims to the sacred caves practise every form of African religion from pre-Christian Basotho ritual and medicine to independent Apostolic to established mission church Christianity.‚Äù Cave Church The Cave Church, also known as the Rose Chapel, having been inhabited in Later Stone Age times, provided the first Anglican missionaries with shelter and their first place of worship. A century later, from 1970, members of the Zionist Christian Church (ZCC) began using it as an important pilgrimage site where the ancestors are felt to be strongly present. Offerings are typically placed here ‚Äì snuff, that the ancestors may ‚Äòbreathe‚Äô better; gambling tokens; scratch-and-win cards; crockery; food; money; written appeals and so forth. Candles are burnt during ceremonies which can involve several hundred people. San rock art Additionally, rock painting sites form part of this ‚Äòsacred landscape‚Äô where the rock art relates to the beliefs and shamanistic ritual performances of San hunter-gatherers of the precolonial era. The site above the mission was declared a National Monument in 1936. It has been abused by visitors who have vandalized the paintings or splashed water to bring out the colours (depositing a film of salts, causing them to fade). The main panel at the site contains remarkable depictions of birds and an unusual winged figure with zigzag legs, believed to represent a shaman or priest who had assumed bird-like form to undertake the journey to the spirit world. Flight is a widespread and recurring metaphor for altered states of consciousness in South African rock art and folklore.

His songs include \\"Till Then\\", \\"My One and Only Love\\", \\"Shoo-Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy\\". His song \\"Till Then\\" reached the pop charts three times (in 1944, 1954, and 1963). Wood also wrote songs for Captain Kangaroo and the Radio City Music Hall. Wood died on 23 February 2001.

HHC is active in its own right with similar potency to THC, but further simplification and variation of this parent structure lead to more potent, yet structurally simpler derivatives such as CP 47,497 and CP 55,940, which after several steps of modification have become quite structurally distinct from THC, while HHC on the other hand is still substantially similar in structure to THC. The discovery of this simplified class of cannabinoid derivatives was highly significant in terms of the widespread use of CP 55,940 for early scientific research into the cannabinoid receptors, as well as later work using more complex compounds such as CP 55,244 to map the CB1 binding site in more detail, but aside from these specific applications, these compounds attracted little attention and no compounds from this series were developed for medical use despite favourable safety profiles in animal studies. Unexpectedly, some 25 years later, these compounds came back into prominence when an obscure derivative (C8)-CP 47,497 was found to have been sold as the active ingredient in the \\"herbal\\" cannabis substitute product Spice, which ironically has led to a resurgence of interest into laboratory-conducted scientific research of this family of drugs.

Over the years, this general term has taken on a variety of specific meanings. Corporate office The oldest use of the term \\"executive suites\\" referred to the suite of offices on or near the top floor of a skyscraper where the top executives of a company worked, usually including at least the president or chief executive officer, various vice presidents and their staff. That use was then applied not just to the physical space but also to the people who occupy the offices and their immediate underlings, much like the White House has come to mean the Executive Office of the President of the United States or 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's Office. A quote from the Ottawa Sun in 2003 shows this use: \\"The Montreal Canadiens are fading in the Eastern Conference playoff race, but there is no panic in the executive suite.\\" The term was used by writer Cameron Hawley for the title of his 1952 book Executive Suite, which was later turned into an Academy Award-winning movie with the same name in 1953 and a short-lived T.V. series in 1975. A 1982 computer game was also called Executive Suite. Serviced office An executive suite can also be a set of individual offices sublet from a larger suite of offices. The executive suite proprietor rents entire floors (or buildings) and leases the smaller office spaces or workstations to businesses that don't need, or can't afford, large space.\\"Executive Suite.\\" MSN Encarta. 2009. Archived 2009-10-31. Some executive suite operators offer additional services.\\"Executive Suites.\\" Entrepreneur.com. 2009. This variation on the traditional office idea has become an industry with roots in the early 1960s. There is no universal agreement on terminology as executive suites go by many different names, such as: open plan office, serviced office, office business center, office suite, business center, executive office, furnished office, flexible office, managed office, shared-office space and hoteling. It is not uncommon for a traditional tenant to sublet unutilized space and to characterize it as an ‚Äúexecutive suite.‚ÄùTarquino, J. Alex. \\"Manhattan is Awash in Sublet Office Space.\\" New York Times. May 26, 2009. Many businesses considering executive suites are small entrepreneur start-up companies that could experience growth or go out of business before a term's end- date.Landers, Jeff. \\"What You Need to Know About Executive Suties.\\" \\"INC\\". July 2006. Considering this, flexible terms are offered to accommodate unforeseen growth or the dissolution of a company. The office space also has a number of amenities that smaller offices may not be able to afford such as a breakroom, video conference room equipment, storage space and mailboxes. They also offer temporary support such as the opportunity for tenants to share executive office staff to assist with projects/assignments. These offices serve many of the same purposes as virtual offices but characteristically include the physical location that other entirely online offices do not. Since the spaces and corresponding rent or lease payments are small, many prospective renters often work directly with landlords to obtain space rather than working through commercial real estate brokers. Other prospective renters use the internet to find executive of small office space to rent or lease. History The first recorded executive suites in the United States were offered by OmniOffices in 1962, followed by furnished offices for attorneys offered by Fegen Law Suites in 1966. In 1978, Alf Mourfarrige founded ServCorp in Sydney, Australia for businesses looking to share overhead expenses, including receptionist and clerical staff. Servcorp took its virtual office concept international in 1980 and in 1999 became a publicly traded company. As technologies such as the portable computer, the World Wide Web, VoIP, and videoconferencing became available in the 1980s and 1990s, executive suites began to offer them as part of a complete ‚Äúvirtual office‚Äù package. In 1985, James Blain, a Michigan-based architect, opened his first AmeriCenters in Troy, Michigan. The company added locations in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio.http://www.americenters.com Mark Dixon conceived an executive suit company in 1989 on a trip to Belgium.\\"Regus Group PLC.

First appearing as an unnamed character in Batman #156 (June 1963), the character was retro-actively revived in 2008 by writer Grant Morrison and established as Thomas Wayne, a distant relative of Bruce Wayne (the alter-ego of Batman) and his father Thomas Wayne. Development info Visually, Doctor Hurt is based on an unnamed scientist who first appeared in Batman #156 (June 1963), in a story titled \\"Robin Dies at Dawn\\". In that story Batman participated in an experiment for NASA that caused him to hallucinate that Robin (Dick Grayson) was in constant danger; the story itself is referenced many times in Morrison's run on Batman. The character made behind-the-scenes appearances throughout Morrison's run Batman #665, 667, 669, 673, 674 before actually appearing fully in the first chapter of \\"Batman R.I.P.\\"Batman #676 The character was first called \\"Doctor Simon Hurt\\" in Batman #674. He is a brilliant psychologist whose true identity and nature is an enigma; over the course of Morrison's run he has been strongly implied at times to be the devil, the demon Barbatos, a supernaturally-empowered ancestor of Bruce Wayne, Bruce Wayne's long-lost evil twin, Bruce Wayne's father, an instrument of Darkseid, and perhaps even Darkseid himself. Hurt is dedicated to completely destroying Batman in body, mind, and soul, and replacing him with a corrupted, evil counterpart. Doctor Hurt led both the Black Glove and the Club of Villains against Batman in \\"Batman R.I.P.\\" Hurt was the main antagonist of Morrison's run on Batman titles from 2007 to 2011, appearing in Batman, The Return of Bruce Wayne, and Batman and Robin, as well as behind- the-scenes in Final Crisis. Fictional character biography A psychiatrist, Doctor Hurt was involved in a program which created three \\"replacement Batmen\\" with the participation of the Gotham City Police Department. Sometime after the three replacements had been trained, Hurt was hired by the Defense Department to oversee an isolation experiment. During this process, he gave Batman a post-hypnotic trigger connected to the phrase \\"Zur-En-Arrh\\". He also arranged for the replacements to fight the dazed Batman, but they were defeated; Batman suspected nothing of this. Going over his notes on Batman's psychology, he realized that Batman was \\"powered by tragedy\\" and set about traumatizing the three replacements, ostensibly to make them better crimefighters. Many years later, Doctor Hurt was working with the Black Glove when they decided to target Batman and the Dark Knight's allies. Their first attack consisted of character assassination on the Wayne family, by spreading information to suggest that Thomas Wayne somehow survived the murder by Joe Chill (to the point of arranging for the 'attack' in order to conceal his own debauchery). Hurt then, using the Zur-En-Arrh trigger in conjunction with drugs, sent the dazed and confused Bruce Wayne onto the streets of Gotham with no memory. Furthering this attack, he claimed to Alfred Pennyworth that he was actually Thomas himself, although Alfred denied this. However, Batman survived thanks to years of preparation, culminating in a confrontation with Hurt on Arkham Asylum's roof. He accused Hurt of being Mangrove Pierce, an actor, acquaintance, and occasional impersonator of Thomas, but Hurt claimed that he had actually \\"skinned Mangrove Pierce alive and wore [the man] to Mayhew's party\\".Batman #667-669 Hurt was believed to be dead after a helicopter explosion, but somehow survived and reappeared approximately six months later in Mexico, disguised as the drug lord El Penitente, but left to return to Gotham City.Batman and Robin #11 With the Joker working as an unreliable ally, Hurt used the Circus of Crime to release a drug into Gotham's air with the intention of driving the city mad, subsequently making a public return as Thomas with the intention of setting up his headquarters in the Batcave. Hurt shot Dick Grayson in the back of the head and attempted to force Damian Wayne to swear allegiance to him in order to save Grayson's life. However, Grayson and Damian had already anticipated his attack; the attempts to open the box that Bruce left in the past revealing nothing but a Batarang and a note saying \\"Gotcha!\\", the room subsequently filling with smoke as another Batman appears,Batman and Robin #15 marking Bruce's return to the fold. It is revealed that he is a relative of the Wayne family from the 17th century whose true identity is Thomas Wayne, a black sheep of the family because of his devil worship. Hurt prolonged his life through a series of occult rituals. In a story immediately previous, Batman states that Darkseid is attempting to \\"incarnate . . . in Hurt . . . in the Doctor\\".Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #6 In the subsequent confrontation, Hurt attempts‚Äîand fails‚Äîto trap Bruce in a prison in the Batcave, but nevertheless escapes through the cave's water access while Bruce is busy rescuing Alfred. Having escaped to a graveyard, Hurt is confronted and defeated by the Joker when he slips on a banana peel and breaks his neck. The Joker doses Hurt with Joker venom and buries him alive, claiming that he proved to be a disappointment as a \\"new\\" arch-enemy. It is revealed that Dick has survived the injuries, despite Hurt's intent to eventually render him comatose and nearly brain dead.Batman and Robin #16 The Joker claims that he has \\"taken care\\" of Hurt, but Bruce is not quite willing to believe that the Doctor is truly dead. He appears in the Convergence limited series, where a group of Pre-Flashpoint Batman villains, including the Riddler and Professor Pyg, attempt to confront the Batman of the modern, reimagined Earth-Two (who is commonly mistaken for the Flashpoint Batman due to a similar costume). These villains, seeing him as simply an obstacle, attack en masse. This version of Hurt is eventually slain when Thomas blows himself up as a delaying tactic.Convergence #3 (April 2015) DC Rebirth Hurt later reappeared in Nightwing #18 in the DC Rebirth Universe. Nightwing #14 Simon recruited Professor Pyg and made him create Dollotrons of Robin and Nightwing, one that becomes the man known as Deathwing. Deathwing brings him Robin, who he plans to kill at dawn, but the Doctor was apparently killed when Deathwing stabbed him, but not before stabbing Deathwing too. Nightwing #20 Character overview Hurt claims to be Dr. Thomas Wayne, the name being shared with a devil-worshiping ancestor back in the 18th century. Batman initially suspects him to be the actor Mangrove Pierce, dismissing the belief of the third replacement Batman and the Joker that Hurt is the devil; Hurt alludes to this possibility several times using metaphor only, claiming \\"I am the hole in things...\\"the enemy\\", \\"the piece that can never fit, there since the beginning\\", all cryptic statements that relate to the mythology of a Satanic figure. Near the end of \\"Batman R.I.P.\\", however, Batman begins to wonder whether Hurt really is the devil. Batman states that Darkseid is attempting to \\"incarnate\\" in Hurt.Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #6 Following numerous hints and plot threads throughout Batman and Robin and Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne, the mystery of Hurt's identity was seemingly resolved in Batman and Robin #16, in which he was identified as a devil-worshipping ancestor of Bruce Wayne's named Thomas Wayne (first mentioned in Batman and Robin #10 and appearing in Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #4). The issue reveals that, centuries beforehand, Hurt attempted to summon the demon Barbatos, but instead was confronted by the Hyper-Adapter, a hyper-dimensional creature tasked by Darkseid with overseeing Batman's voyage through history after he was struck by the villain's Omega Effect. Corrupted ‚Äî or perhaps possessed ‚Äî by the Hyper-Adapter's energies, this Thomas Wayne became extremely long-lived (potentially immortal), living until the present day, when he was taken in by Batman's parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne. Wishing to help him, the Waynes send him to Willowood Asylum, a reference to a Pre-Crisis story in which Bruce had a mentally damaged brother who was sent to the same facility.World's Finest Comics #223 by Bob Haney This had previously been referenced in Morrison's Batman #702, which showed the asylum as the same hospital to which Thomas Wayne Jr. was sent. Batman and Dick Grayson conclude this reading of events to be the truth, and impartial flashbacks in the issue appear to confirm it as accurate, though the insane Hurt continues to claim throughout the issue that he is both Thomas Wayne and the devil. However, since Hurt was already an adult man when the Waynes met him, it seems unlikely that they would have claimed him to be their son, Thomas Jr. As Bruce Wayne travels through time as a result of the Omega Effect, Hurt is seen as a doctor in Willowood, rather than a patient.Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #5 by Grant Morrison Grant Morrison explains the ambiguity during an interview in Wizard Magazine: Other versions Hurt appears in the \\"Batman in Bethlehem\\" alternate future where Damian Wayne became Batman In Batman Incorporated (vol. 2) #5.

Mammoths were the primary prey of hunters. As that prey moved eastward, they followed, vacating the area. Other nomadic tribes (archaic Indians) moved into the area, mostly from Mexico to the south and California to the west. Around approximately 1,000 BC, the nomadic began to be accompanied by two other types of cultures, commonly called the farmers and the villagers, prompted by the introduction of maize into their culture. Out of these archaic Indians, the Hohokam civilization arose. The Hohokam first settled the area around 1 AD, and in about 500 years, they had begun to establish the canal system which enabled agriculture to flourish in the area. They suddenly disappeared by 1450, for unknown reasons. By the time the first Europeans arrived at the beginning of the 16th century, the two main groups of native Indians who inhabited the area were the O'odham and Sobaipuri tribes. While the first explorers were Spanish, their attempts at settlement were confined to Tucson and the south before 1800. Central Arizona was first settled during the early 19th century by American settlers. The city of Phoenix's story begins as people from those settlements expanded south, in conjunction with the establishment of a military outpost to the east of current day Phoenix. The town of Phoenix was settled in 1867, and incorporated in 1881 as the City of Phoenix. Phoenix served as an agricultural area that depended on large-scale irrigation projects. Until World War II, the economy was based on the \\"Five C's\\": cotton, citrus, cattle, climate, and copper. The city provided retail, wholesale, banking, and governmental services for central Arizona, and was gaining a national reputation among winter tourists. The post World War Two years saw the city beginning to grow more rapidly, as many men who had trained in the military installations in the valley, returned, bringing their families. The population growth was further stimulated in the 1950s, in part because of the availability of air conditioning, which made the very hot dry summer heat tolerable, as well as an influx of industry, led by high tech companies. The population growth rate of the Phoenix metro area has been nearly 4% per year for the past 40 years. That growth rate slowed during the Great Recession but the U.S. Census Bureau predicted it would resume as the nation's economy recovered, and it already has begun to do so. While currently ranked 5th largest city in the United States by population, it is predicted that Phoenix will rank 4th by 2020. Native American period Paleo and archaic Indian period The first inhabitants of the desert southwest, including what would become Phoenix, called Paleo-Indians, were hunters and gatherers. The term \\"paleo\\", is derived from the Greek word ‚Äúpalaios,‚Äù meaning ancient. They hunted Pleistocene animals, such as mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, ancient horses, camels, and giant sloths, remains of which have been discovered in the Salt River Valley. Inhabiting the southwestern United States and northern Mexico for tens of thousands of years, when the prey they depended on left the area, they followed in approximately 9,000 BC. After the departure of the paleo-Indians, archaic Indians moved into the American Southwest. This period lasted from roughly about 7,000 BC until the onset of the Christian era. Consisting of small bands of hunters and gatherers, these nomads traveled throughout the area for millennia, until about 3,000 years ago when their culture began to become an agricultural lifestyle. At about this time, the introduction of the cultivation of maize further contributed to the agrarian culture. As time went on and farming became more established, groups began developing differences in their material culture. Through these differences, cultures of the Southwest became more visibly distinct from one another, which would be broken down into the farmers, the villagers, and the nomads. From the farmers culture would emerge a tribe known as the Hohokam. Hohokam period This Hohokam Petroglyph. located at the Deer Valley Rock Art Center in Phoenix shows a \\"scene\\", in the lower right hand corner, of two deer bumping heads. At some point in the centuries before the Common Era, a group of archaic Indians migrated north from Mexico, bringing with them an agrarian society, different from the hunter-gatherer cultures of most of the archaic Indian tribes. Evidence of this culture has been uncovered in the Tucson area, consisting of slab-lined storage pits, and \\"sleeping circles\\". This archaic Indian culture would give rise to the Hohokam peoples, who, right around the beginning of the Common Era, moved further north and settled in the Salt River basin. Map of Hohokam Lands c. 1350 For more than 2,000 years, the Hohokam peoples occupied the land that would become Phoenix. Hohokam is a present-day name given to the occupants of central and southern Arizona who lived here between about the year 1 and 1450 CE (current era). It is derived from the Pima Indian (Akimel O'odham) word for \\"those who have gone\\" or \\"all used up\\". The Hohokam inhabitation of the valley is broken up by paleontologists into five periods. The earliest period is known as the Pioneer Period, which lasted roughly from 1‚Äì700 AD, and was categorized by groups of shallow pit houses, and by its end the first canals were being used for irrigation, and the first decorated ceramics were appearing. This was followed by the Colonial Period (c. 700 ‚Äì 900 AD), during which time the irrigation system was expanded and the community sizes grew, as did the size of the dwellings. Rock art and ballcourts began to appear, and cremations became the usual form of burial. 900 to 1150 AD, referred to as the Sedentary Period, again saw the expansion of the settlements and the canal system. Platform mounds began to be built, and plazas and the ballcourts which began to appear in the last period, became more prevalent in the larger settlements. The final period, the Classic Period, lasted approximately from 1150 AD until 1450 AD. The number of villages declined during this period, but the size of the remaining settlements increased. During their inhabitation of the valley, the Hohokam created roughly 135 miles (217 km) of irrigation canals, making the desert land arable. Paths of these canals would later become used for the modern Arizona Canal, Central Arizona Project Canal, and the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct. The irrigation provided by these canals enabled the Hohokam culture to spread throughout the valley, and by 1300 AD, the Hohokam were the largest population in the prehistoric Southwest, and the largest native population north of Mexico City. This was the largest single body of land irrigated in prehistoric times in North or South America, perhaps in the world. The Hohokam also carried out extensive trade with the nearby Anasazi, Mogollon and Sinagua, as well as with the more distant Mesoamerican civilizations like the Aztecs. It is believed that a Hohokam witness of the supernova that occurred in 1006 CE created a representation of the event in the form of a petroglyph that can be found in the White Tank Mountain Regional Park west of Phoenix. If confirmed, this is the only known Native American representation of the supernova. At some point in the mid-15th century, the Hohokam culture simply disappeared from the area, speculation as to why as focused on periods of drought and severe floods during this period.Trimble 1988, p. 105. Modern Indian period After the departure of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O'odham (commonly known as Pima), Tohono O‚Äôodham and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache. The O'odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the formerly urbanized Hohokam. The two O'odham peoples were split between the Akimel (river people) and Tohono (desert people). The Akimel O‚Äôodham were the major Indian group in the area, and lived in small villages, with well-defined irrigation systems, which spread over the entire Gila River Valley, from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west. Their crops included corn, beans and squash for food, while cotton and tobacco were also cultivated. Mostly a peaceful group, they did band together with the Maricopa for their mutual protection against incursions by both the Yuma and Apache tribes. The Tohono O'odham lived in the region as well, but their main concentration was further to south of the Pima, and stretched all the way to the Mexican border. Originally known to the European settlers as the Papago (which literally means \\"tepary-bean eater\\"), in recent times the tribe has dropped usage of that name. Living in small settlements, the O'odham were seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains, rather than the large-scale irrigation of the Akimel. They grew crops such as sweet Indian corn, tapery beans, squash, lentils sugar cane and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants, such as saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap from the mesquite tree). They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit and javalina for meat. The Maricopa are part of the larger Yuma people, however they migrated east from the lower Colorado and Gila Rivers in the early 1800s, when they began to be enemies with their Yuma brethren, settling amongst the existing communities of the Akimel O'odham. European arrival Spanish explorers most likely traveled through the area in the 16th century. They left accounts of their travels, and also left behind European diseases that ravaged Indian tribes with no immunity, especially smallpox, measles and influenza. The Spanish opened a mission in the Tucson area, but made no settlements anywhere near Phoenix.Thomas E. Sheridan, Arizona: A History (1995) pp 22‚Äì39 When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War ended in 1848, most of Mexico's northern zone passed to United States control, and a portion of it was made the New Mexico Territory (including what is now Phoenix) shortly afterward. Then In the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 the U.S. promised to honor all land rights of the area, including those of the O'odham. The O'odham gained full constitutional rights. During the American Civil War, the Salt River and Gila River Valleys, which comprise much of the territory which makes up Phoenix today, were claimed by both sides in the conflict. Confederate Arizona was officially claimed by The South, and formally created by a proclamation by Jefferson Davis on February 14, 1862. Its capital was at Mesilla, in New Mexico. The North claimed the Salt River Valley as part of the Arizona Territory, formed by Congress in 1863 with its capital at Fort Whipple, before it was moved the following year to Prescott. While laying claim to the area, the Confederates made no move to enforce that claim, while one of the reasons for the establishment of Fort McDowell was to support the North's possession of the territory. However, since the Phoenix area had no military value, it was not contested ground during the war. The founding of Phoenix In 1863 the mining community of Wickenburg was the first to be established in what is now Maricopa County, to the north-west of modern Phoenix. At the time Maricopa County had not yet been incorporated: the land was within Yavapai County, which included the major town of Prescott to the north of Wickenburg. Jack Swilling (1830-1878) founded Phoenix in 1867 as a venture in irrigated farmland. He never overcame his addiction to drugs and liquor, and died in jail while awaiting trial for highway robbery.Bradford Luckingham, Phoenix: The History of a Southwestern Metropolis (1995). pp. 272‚Äì73. As the Civil War came to a close, settlers from the north and east began to encroach on the Valley of the Sun. The US Army set up Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to quell Native American uprisings. In order to create a supply of hay for their needs, the fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River in 1866, which was the first non-native settlement in the valley. In later years, other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of Tempe, but this community was incorporated after Phoenix. The history of the city begins with Jack Swilling, a Confederate veteran who in November, 1867 on a visit to the Fort's camp was the first to appreciate the agricultural potential of the Salt River Valley. He promoted the 1st irrigation system, which was in part inspired by the ruins of Hohokam canals. Returning to Wickenburg, he raised funds from local gold miners and formed the Swilling Irrigating and Canal Company, whose intent was to build irrigation canals and develop the Salt River Valley for farming. The next month, December, Swilling led a group of 17 miners back to the valley, where they began the process of building the canals which would revitalize the area. There is no concrete evidence on who came up with the name for the new community, but anecdotal stories give credit to Darrell Duppa, who suggested they name it Phoenix. Swilling had suggested \\"Stonewall\\", after Stonewall Jackson, and another proposed name was Salina, which had been an early name for the Salt River. However, in light of the rebirth of a town after the collapse of the Hohokam civilization, the name Phoenix predominated. A letter to a newspaper in Prescott, shows that this name was already in use by January 1868. The Phillip Darrell Duppa adobe homestead house built around 1870 and located at 116 W. Sherman St. is one of Phoenix's oldest houses. This was the homestead house of \\"Lord\\" Darrell Duppa, an Englishman who is credited with naming the towns of \\"Phoenix\\" and \\"Tempe\\" and who is the founding of the town of New River, Arizona. The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County, which at the time encompassed Phoenix, officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and formed an election precinct. The first post office was established on June 15, 1868, located in Swilling's homestead, with Swilling serving as the postmaster. With the number of residents growing (the 1870 U.S. census reported a total Salt River Valley population of 240), a town site needed to be selected. On October 20, 1870, the residents held a meeting to decide where to locate it. The decision was hotly contested between two sites: the original settlement around Swilling's farm, and a site about a mile to the west, which was supported by the newly founded \\"Salt River Valley Town Association\\" (SRVTA). Due to economic considerations benefitting the members of SRVTA, the more westerly townsite was selected, and a plot of land was purchased in what is now the downtown business section. Phoenix Herald Building - 1879 On February 14, 1871, following a vote by the territorial legislature, Governor Anson P.K. Safford issued a proclamation creating Maricopa County by dividing Yavapai County. In that same proclamation, he named Phoenix the county seat, but that nomination was subject to the approval of the voters. An election was held in May, 1871, at which Phoenix' selection as the county seat was ratified. Quite a few members of SRVTA were also elected to county positions: among them were John Alsap (Probate Judge), William Hancock (Surveyor) and Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff. Barnum ran unopposed as the other two candidates had a shootout that left one dead and the other withdrawing from the race. The town's first government consisted of three commissioners. Several lots of land were sold in 1870 at an average price of $48. The first church opened in 1871, as did the first store. The first public school class was held on September 5, 1872, in the courtroom of the county building. By October 1873, a small school was completed on Center Street (now Central Avenue). The total value of the Phoenix Townsite was $550, with downtown lots selling for between $7 and $11 each. By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, sixteen saloons, and four dance halls, but the townsite-commissioner form of government was no longer working well. At a mass meeting on Oct. 20, 1875, an election was held to select three village trustees and other officials. Those first three trustees were John Smith (Chairman), Charles W. Stearns (treasurer), and Capt. Hancock (secretary). 1878 saw the opening of the first bank, a branch of the Bank of Arizona, and by 1880, Phoenix's population stood at 2,453. Later in 1880 the first legal hanging in Maricopa County was held, performed in town. Incorporation (1881) The Jones-Montoya House, located at 1008 E. Buckeye Road, was built in 1879 and is one of the oldest known houses in Phoenix. By 1881, Phoenix' continued growth made the existing village structure with a board of trustees obsolete. The 11th Territorial Legislature passed \\"The Phoenix Charter Bill\\", incorporating Phoenix and providing for a mayor-council government. The bill was signed by Governor John C. Fremont on February 25, 1881, officially incorporating Phoenix with a population of approximately 2,500. On May 3, 1881, Phoenix held its first city election. Judge John T. Alsap defeated James D. Monihon, 127 to 107, to become the city's first mayor. As the city developed, so did its infrastructure and services, usually in response to a recent crisis or event. The public health department was created in the early 1880s after several smallpox outbreaks. This was followed by the establishment of a volunteer fire department after two serious fires in the city, which in turn led to the development of a public water system, begun in 1887. Other services which would see their beginnings in this decade were a private gas lighting company (1886), telephone company (1886), a mule-drawn streetcar system (1887), and electric power (1888). An aerial lithograph of Phoenix from 1885 The coming of the railroad in the 1880s was the first of several important events that revolutionized the economy of Phoenix. A spur of the Southern Pacific Railroad, the Phoenix and Maricopa, was extended from Maricopa into Tempe in 1887. Merchandise now flowed into the city by rail instead of wagon. Phoenix became a trade center, with its products reaching eastern and western markets. In response, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce was organized on November 4, 1888. Earlier in 1888 the city offices were moved into the new City Hall, at Washington and Central (later the site of the city bus terminal, until Central Station was built in the 1990s). When the territorial capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889 the temporary territorial offices were also located in City Hall. The Arizona Republic became a daily paper in 1890, with Ed Gill as its editor.Earl A. Zarbin, All the Time a Newspaper: The First 100 Years of the Arizona Republic (1990) 1891 was marked by the greatest flood in the Valley's history, and 1892 saw the creation of the Phoenix Sewer and Drainage Department. The Phoenix Street Railway electrified its mule-drawn streetcar lines in 1893, with streetcar service continuing until a 1947 fire. Another important event which occurred in 1893 was the passage of a territorial law which allowed Phoenix to annex land surrounding the city, as long as it obtained the permission of the inhabitants of that area. This would begin a process which lasts till today, as the city annexed some surrounding terrain, growing from its original 0.5 square miles of territory to slightly over 2 square miles of territory by the turn of the century. On March 12, 1895, the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad ran its first train to Phoenix, connecting it to the northern part of Arizona. The additional railroad sped the capital city's economic rise. The year 1895 also saw the establishment of Phoenix Union High School, with an enrollment of 90. From 1900 to 1940 Central Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona, 1908 By the turn of the century, the population of Phoenix had reached 5,554, and the following year, on February 25, 1901, Governor Murphy dedicated the permanent state Capitol building. It was built on a 10-acre site on the west end of Washington Street, at a cost of $130,000. The Phoenix City Council levied a $5,000,000 tax for a public library after the state legislature, in 1901, passed a bill allowing such a tax to support free libraries. This action satisfied the conditions set by Andrew Carnegie in his proposal to donate a library building to the city. The Carnegie Free Library opened in 1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler. The Phoenix weather was a major attraction for tuberculosis patients at a time when the only cure for the widespread, fatal lung disease was rest in a dry, warm climate. The Roman Catholic order of the Sisters of Mercy opened St. Joseph's Hospital in 1895, with 24 private rooms for tuberculosis patients. Although the Catholic population was small and poor, the city's Protestants were generous and funding a new hospital. In 1910 the sisters opened Arizona's first school of nursing. Today St. Joseph's Hospital is part of a corporation called Catholic Healthcare West, and is still operated by the Sisters of Mercy. Until 1901, the sisters also ran Sacred Heart Academy, an elite school for young ladies. The Sisters of the Precious Blood opened St. Mary's Catholic High School in 1917. Brophy College Preparatory for boys was opened in 1928 by the Jesuits.Kathy Smith Franklin, \\"A Spirit of Mercy: The Sisters of Mercy and the Founding of St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, 1892-1912,\\" Journal of Arizona History (1998) 39#3 pp 263-288. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the National Reclamation Act, allowing for dams to be built on western streams for reclamation purposes. Residents were quick to enhance this by organizing the Salt River Valley Water Users' Association (on February 7, 1903), to manage the water and power supply. The agency still exists as part of the Salt River Project. Theodore Roosevelt Dam was started in 1906. It was the first multiple-purpose dam, supplying both water and electric power, to be constructed under the National Reclamation Act. On May 18, 1911, the former President himself dedicated the dam, which was the largest masonry dam in the world, forming several new lakes in the surrounding mountain ranges. Hotel San Carlos - Opened in 1928 On February 14, 1912, under President William Howard Taft, Phoenix became the capital of the newly formed state of Arizona. This occurred just six months after Taft had vetoed, on August 11, 1911, a joint resolution giving Arizona statehood. Taft disapproved of the recall of judges in the state constitution. Compared to Tucson or Prescott, Phoenix was considered preferable as the capital because of its central location. It was smaller than Tucson, but outgrew that city within the next few decades, to become the state's largest city. Radio program written and performed in Phoenix, Arizona, by children of Junior Artists Club (Federal Arts Program, 1935). In 1913 Phoenix adopted a new form of government, changing from a mayor-council system to council-manager, making it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government. After statehood, Phoenix's growth started to accelerate, and by the end of its first eight years under statehood, Phoenix' population had grown to 29,053. Two thousand were attending Phoenix Union High School. In 1920 Phoenix built its first skyscraper, the Heard Building.https://www.phoenix.gov/pio/city- publications/city-history In 1928 Scenic Airways, Inc. saw profitability in flights in the Southwest. Scenic General Manager, J. Parker Van Zandt purchased land for Scenic in Phoenix, and named the new airport Sky Harbor, which was formally dedicated on Labor Day in 1929. On March 4, 1930 Former President Calvin Coolidge dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor. Because of a long drought the \\"lake\\" behind it held no water. Humorist Will Rogers, also a guest speaker, quipped, \\"If that was my lake I‚Äôd mow it.\\" Phoenix's population had more than doubled during the 1920s, and now stood at 48,118. After the stock market crash of 1929, Sky Harbor was sold to another investor, and in 1930 American Airlines brought passenger and air mail service to Phoenix. In 1935 the city of Phoenix purchased the single runway airport, nicknamed \\"The Farm\\" due to its isolation, and it has been owned and operated by the city to this day. During the 1930s couples used to fly into Sky Harbor solely to get married at the chapel, for Arizona was one of the few states that did not have a waiting period for marriage. It was also during the 1930s that Phoenix and its surrounding area began to be called \\"The Valley of the Sun\\", which was an advertising slogan invented to boost tourism. In 1940 as the Depression ended, Phoenix had a population of 65,000 (with 121,000 more in the remainder of Maricopa County). Its economy was still based on cotton, citrus and cattle, while it also provided retail, wholesale, banking, and governmental services for central Arizona, and was gaining a national reputation among winter tourists. 1940s  World War II  During World War II, Phoenix's economy shifted to that of a distribution center, rapidly turning into an embryonic industrial city with mass production of military supplies. There were 3 Air Force fields in the area: Luke Field, Williams Field, and Falcon Field, as well as two large pilot training camps, Thunderbird Field No. 1 in Glendale and Thunderbird Field No. 2 in Scottsdale. These facilities, coupled with the giant Desert Training Center created by General George S. Patton west of Phoenix, brought thousands of new people into Phoenix. Mexican-American local organizations enthusiastically supported the war effort, providing encouragement for the large number of men who enlisted, and assistance for their families. Many civilians were employed in the war effort, bringing the community more money than ever before. Some projects were organized in cooperation with the dominant Anglo community, but most were operated separately. Numerous postwar politicians got their start during the war on the home front, or from their experiences and contacts in the military. The postwar G.I. Bill of Rights provided mortgage funding for home ownership, allowing thousands to move out of small apartments.Christine Mar√≠n, \\"Mexican Americans on the Home Front: Community Organizations in Arizona during World War II, \\" Perspectives in Mexican American Studies (1993), Vol. 4, pp 75-92. On Thanksgiving night 1942, a brawl at a bar led to MP's arresting a black soldier, followed by a riot of black troops from segregated units. Three men died and eleven were wounded in the riot. Most of the 180 men arrested and jailed were released, but some were court-martialed and sent to military prison. German prisoners of war built a secret tunnel at the prisoner-of-war camp which was located at the present site of Papago Park. In the Great Papago Escape of 23 December 1944, 25 POW's escaped. Local and federal officials took a month to recapture them all. During the war, public transportation was overwhelmed by the newcomers at a time when gasoline was rationed to 3 gallons a week and no new autos were built. In 1943, the transit systems operated seventeen streetcars and fifty-five buses. They carried 20,000,000 passengers a year. A fire in 1947 destroyed most of the streetcars, and the city switched to buses. Postwar growth A town that had just over sixty-five thousand residents in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, with a population of nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. The postwar boom was based on the arrival of young veterans who had seen enough of the city to realize its potential, and new industries. Large industry, learning of this labor pool, started to move branches here. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Motorola was attracted by the city's business-friendly attitude, its location within reasonable distance of supply houses in New Mexico and southern California, the potential for engineering programs at Arizona State College (now Arizona State University), and the climate. In time, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would follow Motorola's lead and set up manufacturing operations in the Valley. Barry Goldwater Barry Goldwater (1909‚Äì1998) was one of the city's most prominent local, statewide and national leaders. He is known for owning the city's largest department store, working to reform city government, building and leading the state Republican Party (GOP), gaining a national visibility as a powerful senator, becoming known as \\"Mr. Conservative\\" for his articulation of the once unpopular ideology, and running a dramatic presidential campaign in 1964 that lost in a landslide but shifted the GOP permanently to the right.Robert Goldberg, Barry Goldwater (1997)Rick Perlstein, Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus (2001) He was born in Phoenix before Arizona became a state, the son of Baron M. Goldwater and his wife, Hattie Josephine (\\"JoJo\\") Williams. His father came from a Jewish family that had emigrated from England and founded Goldwater's, the largest department store in Phoenix. Goldwater's mother, who was Episcopalian came from an old Yankee family that included the famous theologian, Roger Williams.Goldberg p. 21 Goldwater's parents were married in the Episcopal church and Baron broke permanently from the Jewish community. For his entire life, Goldwater was an Episcopalian, but the national media identified him as the first Jewish candidate for president, He took over the family business in 1930. In a heavily Democratic state Goldwater became a conservative Republican and a friend of Herbert Hoover. He was outspoken against New Deal liberalism, especially its close ties to labor unions that he considered corrupt. Phoenix schools were segregated and the atmosphere was Southern; Goldwater quietly supported civil rights for blacks, but would not let his name be used.Robert Alan Goldberg, Barry Goldwater (1995) pp 88-90 A pilot, outdoorsman and photographer, he developed a deep interest in both the natural history and the human history of Arizona. He entered Phoenix politics in 1949 when he was elected to the City Council as part of a nonpartisan team of candidates who promised to clean up widespread prostitution and gambling. The group won every mayoral and council election for two decades. Goldwater rebuilt the weak Republican party and won election to the U.S. Senate in 1952, defeating the Senate Majority Leader Ernest McFarland by enough of a lead in the Phoenix area to narrowly overcome Democratic strength in rural Arizona.Goldberg, Barry Goldwater (1995) pp 85-86, 92-99  Reform of city government  In 1947 a new organization, the Phoenix Charter Revision Committee, began to analyze the administrative instability, factionalism, mediocrity and low morale that had long paralyzed city government. The proposed a series of reforms and reorganized itself as the nonpartisan Charter Government Committee. Goldwater was a leader, and the committee, starting in 1949, swept nearly all the elections in the next two decades. The Committee had a broad base that included many civic and business leaders, and made sure that all the city's religions were represented. It had one woman but no blacks or Hispanics. Eugene C. Pulliam, owner of the city's major newspaper the Arizona Republic, provided extensive publicity. Much of the Committee's funding secretly came from Gus Greenbaum, an associate of organized crime figures, despite the Committee's vehement public denunciation of crime and corruption.Robert Alan Goldberg, Barry Goldwater (1995), 76-82 The newly invigorated city council introduced a more efficient, less corrupt system based on a professional city manager. While the Committee could win all its elections, it was defeated on one major policy issue when a different grassroots group warned against urban renewal proposals, saying they were socialistic and threatened the rights of private property owners.Philip R. VanderMeer, \\"The Valley of Fear: Political Change, Housing Reform, and Anticommunism in Phoenix, 1950 to 1970,\\" Journal of Urban History (2013) 39#6 pp 1027-1044. /content/39/6/1027.full.pdf+html online  The 1950s  Population and industrial growth The city grew explosively in the 1950s; the population expanded by a factor of three, and industry by a factor of fifteen. The growth brought serious problems of minority housing, traffic congestion, smog, and a fading of the traditional laid-back Phoenix lifestyle.Michael Konig, \\"Phoenix in the 1950S: Urban Growth in the 'Sunbelt,'\\" Arizona & the West (1982) 24#1 pp 19-38. By 1950, over 105,000 people lived within the city and thousands more in surrounding communities. There were 148 miles (238 km) of paved streets and 163 miles (262 km) of unpaved streets. The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in mechanical air conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat known to Phoenix during its long summers. Affordable cooling in the decade contributed to a wild building boom. In 1959 alone, Phoenix saw more new construction than it had in the more than three decades from 1914 to 1946. In May 1953, Phoenix became the location of the very first franchise of the McDonald's restaurant chain. The restaurant was located near the southwest corner of Central Avenue and Indian School Road. In addition to being the first McDonald's franchise, the Phoenix location was also the first McDonald's restaurant to feature the \\"Golden Arches\\" which would become the emblematic architectural element of the global restaurant chain. The McDonald brothers, Richard and Maurice, desiring to expand the successful restaurant they had created in San Bernardino, California licensed the first McDonald's franchise to Phoenix businessman, Neil Fox and two other partners for a licensing fee of $1,000.00.Phoenix Magazine, August 2016; Mac Daddy; Keridwen Cornelius. http://www.phoenixmag.com/history/mac-daddy.html Political transformation Arizona moved from a Democratic stronghold in the 1930s to a Republican bastion by the 1960s, with Phoenix leading the way. The Democrats lost the 5 to 1 advantage in voter registration they held at war's end to one of equal balance by 1970. Pearce sees multiple reasons for the transition, especially the demographic change that brought in Midwesterners with a Republican heritage. The new industries were based on high technology, and attracted engineers and technicians who voted Republican and showed little interest in labor unions, as opposed to the heavily Democratic semiskilled workers in eastern factories. The retirees were mostly Republican as well. A second factor was a favorable media climate, especially from the Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette newspapers and their television stations, owned by Eugene Pulliam. After 1964 however the Pulliam media were politically better balanced. Finally, Pearce points to the quality of Republican candidates that Goldwater had systematically recruited from among the affluent, well-educated new arrivals from the East. They attracted votes across party lines, as did Goldwater himself, as well as Governor Howard Pyle, Congressman John Rhodes and numerous others. Pearce, however, also notes a growing right-wing element, based in Phoenix, that repeatedly challenged the business-oriented Republican establishment.Neal E. Pearce, The Mountain States of America: people, politics, and power in the eight Rocky Mountain states (1972), pp 222-23 1960s to 1980s Over the next several decades, the city and metropolitan area attracted more growth and became a favored tourist destination for its exotic desert setting and recreational opportunities. Nightlife and civic events concentrated along now skyscraper-flanked Central Avenue. In 1960 the Phoenix Corporate Center opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, topping off at 341 feet. 1964 saw the completion of the Rozenweig Center, today called Phoenix City Square. Architect Wenceslaus Sarmiento's largest project, the landmark Phoenix Financial Center (better known by locals as the \\"Punch-card Building\\" in recognition of its unique southeastern facade), was also finished in 1964. In addition to a number of other office towers, many of Phoenix's residential high-rises were built during this decade. As in many emerging American cities at the time, Phoenix's spectacular growth did not occur evenly. It largely took place on the city's north side, a space that was nearly all white. In 1962, one local activist testified at a US Commission on Civil Rights hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American. Phoenix's African-American and Mexican- American communities remained largely sequestered on the town's south side. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of Van Buren Street would rent to the African-American baseball star Willie Mays, in town for spring training in the 1960s. In 1964, a reporter from the New Republic wrote of segregation in these terms: \\"Apartheid is complete. The two cities look at each other across a golf course.\\" In 1965, the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum opened on the grounds of the Arizona State Fair, west of downtown, and in 1968, the city was surprisingly awarded the Phoenix Suns NBA franchise, which played its home games at the Coliseum until 1992. In 1968, the Central Arizona Project was approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, assuring future water supplies for Phoenix, Tucson, and the agricultural corridor in between. In 1969 Catholic church created the Diocese of Phoenix on December 2, by splitting the Archdiocese of Tucson. The first bishop was the Most Reverend Edward A. McCarthy, who had become a Bishop in 1965. In 1971, Phoenix adopted the Central Phoenix Plan, allowing unlimited building heights along Central Avenue, but the plan did not sustain long-term development of the \\"Central Corridor.\\" While a few office towers were constructed along North Central during the 1970s, none approached the scope of construction during the previous decade. Instead, the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s, when several high rise buildings were erected, including the buildings currently named Wells Fargo Plaza, the Chase Tower (at 483 feet, the tallest building in both Phoenix and Arizona) and the U.S.Bank Center. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture (see Cityscape, below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. 1972 would see the opening of the Phoenix Symphony Hall, After the Salt River flooded in 1980 and damaged many bridges, the Arizona Department of Transportation and Amtrak worked together and temporarily operated a train service, referred to by the Valley Metro Rail as the \\"Hattie B.\\" line, between central Phoenix and the southeast suburbs. It was discontinued because of high operating costs and a lack of interest from local authorities in maintaining funding. Nominated by President Reagan, on September 25, 1981, Sandra Day O'Connor broke the gender barrier on the U.S. Supreme Court, when she was sworn in as the first female justice. 1985 saw the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the nation's largest nuclear power plant, begin electrical production. Conceived in 1980, the Arizona Science Center, located in Heritage and Science Park, opened in 1984. 1987 saw visits by Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa.  1990-present  Downtown Phoenix at night The new 20 story City Hall opened in 1992, The development of the Sunnyslope area with low-cost housing is noticed by local refugee resettlement centers, which promote the area among refugee communities. During the 1990s, refugees from Afghanistan, Bosnia, the Sudan, Somalia, Congo, Sierra Leone, Laos, Vietnam, and Central and South America would settle there. 43 different languages would be spoken in local schools by the year 2000. Valley National, with $11 billion in assets, was the biggest bank in Arizona, and one of the oldest, when it was bought out by Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, in 1992. The sale for $1.2 billion was part of the trend toward outside ownership of the state's banking assets. 1993 saw the creation of \\"Tent City,\\" by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, using inmate labor, to alleviate overcrowding in the Maricopa County Jail system, the fourth-largest in the world. The famous \\"Phoenix Lights\\" UFO sightings took place in March 1997. 1997 also saw the closing, after 116 years of publication, of The Phoenix Gazette. In the mid-2000s, the Baseline Killer and Serial Shooter crime sprees occurred in Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa. Steele Indian School Park was the site of a mid-air collision between two news helicopters in July 2007. Phoenix has maintained an expansion streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-expanding metropolitan area in the United States preceded by Las Vegas, whose population had expanded by 29.2% during that time. 2008 was an eventful year in the Valley of the Sun. First, the Phoenix Light Rail would begin operation, with service between Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa. Second, Squaw Peak, the second tallest mountain in the city, was officially renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizona native who was the first Native American woman to die in combat with the U.S. military, and the first American female casualty in the 2003 Iraq War. And later that same year Phoenix was one of cities hardest hit by the Subprime mortgage crisis. In early 2009, the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in recent years. Crime rates in Phoenix have declined in recent years and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale, have recovered and stabilized. As of 2005, Downtown Phoenix and the central core were experiencing renewed interest and expansion, resulting in numerous restaurants, stores and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.Nora Burba Trulsson, \\"Phoenix Rising,\\" Sunset (March 2005) pp 27+.

It was committed on 23 October 1993 by Croatian Defence Council (HVO) units called \\"Apostoli\\" and \\"Maturice\\" led by Ivica Rajiƒá, who pleaded guilty before ICTY for war crimes on October 2005. The Croat forces took control of the village and massacred most of the captured people. They raped the women before killing them and looted all houses before setting them on fire. The confirmed number of victims is at least 37.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 49 Background In April 1993, the La≈°va Valley ethnic cleansing carried out by the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia against Bosniaks was culminating. Ethnic cleansing was continued afterwards as well, but with difficulties as Bosnian Army started to retaliate to Croatian attacks. According to the conclusion in the verdict against general Tihomir Bla≈°kiƒá, there is no doubt whatsoever that the attacks carried out by the HVO in April and June 1993 were not justified by strictly military reasons but also targeted Muslim civilians and their possessions in order to make the Muslim civilian populations flee and to ensure that they did not return. In order to achieve this the HVO soldiers mainly acted as follows: they terrorised the civilians by intensive shelling, murders and violence; they systematically torched and destroyed their private homes and places of worship usually after looting them; they slaughtered the livestock and seized agricultural reserves; and finally, they arrested and detained in camps, then finally exchanged or expelled Muslim civilians towards territories under the control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ethnic cleansing was very brutal in Kiseljak municipality under the command of Ivica Rajiƒá. The ICTY Trial Chamber notes that the Kiseljak authorities created an official commission responsible for driving civilians out of the region. Finally, it points out that the municipality in which 10,000 Muslims lived before the hostilities had only 800 remaining after.ICTY - Tihomir Blaskic verdict - ii) The civilian and Muslim character of the targeted populations Paragraphs 627, 630, 631 In conclusion, and as was pointed out by Captain Lanthier, an officer with the Canadian armed forces who served with UNPROFOR from April to November 1993, who was able to visit many of the villages in the Kiseljak enclave after the hostilities: June 1993 ultimatum In June 1993, the Vare≈° HVO issued an ultimatum to Bosnian Muslims in the villages of Da≈°tansko and Stupni Do to surrender their weapons. The Da≈°tansko villagers surrendered their weapons. In Stupni Do, before the expiration of the ultimatum, most of the villagers, fearing an attack, took refuge in neighbouring villages but returned home after several days. Knowing that the Bosnian Army would retaliate if the HVO attacked Stupni Do to disarm the village, the HVO withdrew the ultimatum and the villagers were allowed to keep their weapons.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 35 October 1993 attack By October 1993 the Croat forces were isolated and found their freedom of movement increasingly limited. The Central Bosnian leadership of Croats was concerned about Vare≈°, which it feared might be handed over in the international negotiations. The HVO had taken over Vare≈° in June 1992 but it had always been isolated and surrounded by territories controlled by Bosnian government. On 23 August 1993 the leaders of the HVO in Vare≈° presented ECMM Monitors with a copy of a letter, which had been sent to Franjo Tuƒëman, Mate Boban and Dario Kordiƒá, complaining about the proposed future of Vare≈°, as decided in the Geneva talks, when it was proposed that the municipality come under Bosnian Muslim control.ICTY - Dario Kordic verdict - 5. The Stupni Do Attack: October 1993 - Paragraph 738 Units On 21 October 1993, while Ivica Rajiƒá and Milivoj Petkoviƒá were in Kiseljak, the commander of the Bobovac Brigade, based in Vare≈°, asked for assistance in responding to Bosnian Army attack on HVO military positions in Vare≈° municipality. Milivoj Petkoviƒá ordered Ivica Rajiƒá to take HVO forces and seize control of the situation in Vare≈° town and the surrounding area. Ivica Rajiƒá left Kiseljak town with approximately two hundred soldiers, including commanders and soldiers of the \\"Maturice\\" and \\"Apostoli\\" units and HVO soldiers from Kiseljak and Kakanj. These forces passed through the Serb- controlled territory and reached Vare≈° town on 22 October 1993. The Croat commanders and members who travelled from Kiseljak to Vare≈° included Dominik Ilija≈°eviƒá a.k.a. Como (later convicted of war crimes by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina), Miroslav Aniƒá a.k.a. Firga, Marinko Kepiƒá, Marinko Ljoljo, Marinko ≈†unjiƒá and Marinko Juri≈°iƒá a.k.a. ≈†piro.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraphs 36, 37 The HVO units under Ivica Rajiƒá command, including the Maturice and Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá Brigade, had participated in earlier operations against Bosnian Muslims villages in Kiseljak municipality and committed crimes against Bosnian Muslims, including murder, rape, destruction of property, arbitrary arrest and physical assault. Ivica Rajiƒá knew, for example, that commanders and members of Maturice, including Miroslav Aniƒá a.k.a. Firga, mutilated Bosnian Muslims and hung their heads in the \\"open market\\" in Kiseljak town. During the same time, Dominik Ilja≈°eviƒá a.k.a. Como drove around Kiseljak with a cut off Muslim ear attached to the antenna of his car.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 38 Orders On 23 October 1993, the head of the HVO Main Staff, Slobodan Praljak, ordered Ivica Rajiƒá and others to \\"sort out the situation in Vare≈° showing no mercy towards anyone. Find people who are up to both the times and the tasks.\\" Slobodan Praljak's order was known by local HVO commanders and soldiers and further escalated the highly charged and aggressive attitude against Bosnian Muslims in the Vare≈° area.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 39 Ivica Rajiƒá ordered HVO forces including the Kakanj soldiers (who had demonstrated extreme aggression toward the Bosnian Muslim population in Vare≈° and showed a strong desire to destroy everything that was not Croat) to attack Stupni Do and Bogo≈° Hill and to arrest and detain military-aged Muslim men in Vare≈° town.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 41 Stupni Do is a village located in the hills about one kilometre south of the town of Vare≈°, at a height of 1074 metres, with one principal road leading to it through a tunnel. The village lies above the main supply route to Vare≈° (which itself lies at the head of a valley with mountains all round it). Above the village is the Croat village of Mir. Before the war the inhabitants of Stupni Do were almost all Bosnian Muslim (although there had been five or six Serb families who had left in 1992). The total population was about 224. The significance of the village in October 1993 also lay in the fact that it was in the Vare≈° pocket (controlled by the HVO) close both to the Bosnian Army front lines and also the Serb front lines: thus, according to one ECMM witness, a point between the warring parties ideal for smuggling and the exchange of goods and arms.ICTY - Dario Kordic verdict - 5. The Stupni Do Attack: October 1993 - Paragraph 740 Bosniaks had no chance to resist Croatian attack due to the fact local Bosnian Territorial Defense unit was poorly equipped, armed with 40 rifles (majority for hunting) with no military training: most wore civilian clothing. Additionally, on October 17, six members of this unit were arrested and detained.ICTY - Dario Kordic verdict - 5. The Stupni Do Attack: October 1993 - Paragraph 741 According to Colonel Stutt, a Canadian officer and member of the ECMM, Stupni Do was a loosely organised village; with no sign of a military buildup, fortification or any sign of artillery. It was loosely protected by six Bosnian soldiers.ICTY - Dario Kordic verdict - 5. The Stupni Do Attack: October 1993 - Paragraph 749 On the other hand, both \\"Maturice\\" and \\"Apostoli\\" units were special purposes units supported by heavy artillery.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 31 War crimes In Stupni Do, HVO commanders and soldiers forced Bosnian Muslim civilians out of their homes and hiding places, robbed them of their valuables, wilfully killed men, women and children and sexually assaulted women. Twelve villagers were forced into a shed which HVO soldiers then set on fire. The HVO attack on Stupni Do resulted in the deaths of at least thirty- seven Bosnian Muslim men, women, elderly and children (approximately six of whom were combatants). On 23‚Äì24 October 1993, most of the village was either wholly or partially destroyed. In terms of the Bosnian Muslims who died in the attack, at least the following were murdered: Three men and one woman were executed by being shot or having their throats cut; One woman was taken into a house by an HVO soldier where she was executed; Two elderly women, one of whom was an invalid, were found burned inside a house; One man was shot several times at close range after he refused to give an HVO soldier his money; When a group of Bosnian Muslims (one man, nine women and three children) attempted to flee, the man was shot and killed (his half-burned body was later found at the same location where he was shot), and two of the women and all three children were murdered in front of their house; Three of the young women who escaped the initial encounter with the HVO soldiers were then found hiding in a small cellar and murdered; Seven members of the same family (two men, three women and two children aged 2 and 3 years old) were found burned inside their shelter; One man, who had been severely wounded in both legs, was carried into a house which was later set on fire by HVO soldiers; (The man's burned body, together with another burned body, was later found inside the house.) One woman was taken into a room and shot, and the house then set on fire.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 50 Two international witnesses gave evidence of what they found in the village in the aftermath of the attack. The first, Rolf Weckesser, was an ECMM monitor who tried to get to the village on the morning after the attack but found the HVO blocking the road and refusing entry: the soldiers appeared to be drunk and were yelling and said: \\"We did not like this job, but we had to do it, and we do not like our leaders.\\" On 27 October 1993 the witness finally succeeded in getting access to Stupni Do with the assistance of the local battalion of UNPROFOR (Nordbat). He found a scene of complete destruction with the houses still smouldering and about 20 bodies burnt beyond recognition, some of them the bodies of children. There were no indications of fighting.ICTY - Dario Kordic verdict - 5. The Stupni Do Attack: October 1993 - Paragraph 744 In Vare≈° town, HVO including members of the Apostoli and military police units, rounded up more than 250 Bosnian Muslim men and detained them in the \\"Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá\\" and \\"Vladimir Nazor\\" schools. During the process of rounding up the above-mentioned men, the HVO commanders and soldiers entered houses and physically and mentally abused the inhabitants and persons present and robbed them of their valuables. Detained Bosnian Muslim men were beaten and abused by HVO soldiers. During the time from approximately 23 October to 3 November 1993, in Vare≈° town, HVO commanders and soldiers under Ivica Rajiƒá's command and control looted and appropriated Muslim property, robbed Muslims of their valuables and sexually assaulted Muslim women.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 51 Cover-up operation On 23 October 1993, Ivica Rajiƒá reported to Dario Kordiƒá, Milivoj Petkoviƒá, Tihomir Bla≈°kiƒá and Mario Bradara (commander of the Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá Brigade): \\"I made an assessment and in the morning hours I carried out an attack on Stupni Do and Bogo≈° [...] The town of Vare≈° has been mopped up and all Muslims of military age placed under surveillance. [...] As of today, Vare≈° is Croatian and we shall fight to keep it that way - you must help me.\\"ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 47 Between the evening of 23 October 1993 and 26 October 1993, Ivica Rajiƒá refused several requests by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to enter Stupni Do and the two local schools in Vare≈° town in order to investigate what had happened at these locations.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 52 On the instructions of his HVO superiors, including Milivoj Petkoviƒá, Ivica Rajiƒá participated in a cover-up concerning the crimes committed in and around Vare≈° town and Stupni Do. The cover-up included a false investigation which was intended to conceal the true nature and extent of the crimes committed. Ivica Rajiƒá signed investigation reports prepared by SIS knowing that they included false information. As part of this cover-up, Milivoj Petkoviƒá ordered Ivica Rajiƒá to change his name to Viktor Andriƒá. In fact, the HVO never conducted a bona fide investigation of what happened in Vare≈° town or at Stupni Do, and no HVO commander or soldier, including Ivica Rajiƒá, was ever punished, disciplined or removed for what happened at these locations.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraphs 57, 58 Aftermath Ivica Rajiƒá left Vare≈° town on 26 October 1993, leaving Boro Malba≈°iƒá and Kre≈°imir Bo≈æiƒá in command.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 53 On 1 November 1993, the HVO promoted Ivica Rajiƒá to the rank of active colonel.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 61 On 27 December 1993, Ivica Rajiƒá informed HVO authorities, including Milivoj Petkoviƒá, that, as ordered, he was changing his name to Viktor Andriƒá.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 63 On 30 December 1993, in an action meant to indicate to the international community that Ivica Rajiƒá had been punished and removed from command because of what had happened in Vare≈° and Stupni Do, the HVO removed \\"Ivica Rajiƒá\\" from command and Viktor Andriƒá was appointed to replace him.ICTY - Ivica Rajic sentencing judgement - II. FACTS - Paragraph 64 Rajiƒá left Bosnia after the pressure on Croatian authorities to arrest indicted war criminals. With the help of some Croatian institutions he was hiding in Croatia until 5 April 2003, when he was finally arrested. On 27 June 2003 and 29 January 2004 he pleaded not guilty to all charges. However, on 26 October 2005, he pleaded guilty to grave breaches of the Geneva conventions. On 8 May 2006, he was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment, and on 13 April 2007 transferred to Spain to serve the remainder of his sentence.Rajiƒá (IT-95-12) Stupni Do - Case Information Sheet On 1 November 2010, Miroslav Aniƒá, a former member of the 'Maturice' Special Purposes Squad with the Croatian Defence Council that's suspected of having committed war crimes in Vare≈°, Kiseljak, and specifically the Stupni Do massacre, surrendered to authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The unique characteristics that the Rangers adopted during the force's formative years and that give the division its heritage today‚Äîcharacteristics for which the Texas Rangers would become world- renowned‚Äîhave been accounted for by the nature of the Rangers' duties, which was to protect a thinly populated frontier against protracted hostilities, first with Plains Indian tribes, and after the Texas Revolution, hostilities with Mexico.Fehrenbach, T.R., Lone Star, Wing Books, (1991 Edition), pp. 472-477. Texas historian T.R. Fehrenbach explains the Rangers' uniqueness: > The Rangers were to be described many times, at first as state troops, later > as a police force or constabulary. During most of the 19th century they were > neither. They were apart from the regular army, the militia or national > guard, and were never a true police force.

If they bore certain > similarities to Mamelukes and Cossacks, they were never quite the > same.Fehrenbach, Lone Star, p. 473. Creation and early days An early depiction of a group of Texas Rangers, c. 1845 By the early 1830s, the Mexican War of Independence had subsided, and some 60 to 70 families had settled in Texas‚Äîmost of them from the United States. Because there was no regular army to protect the citizens against attacks by native tribes and bandits, in 1823, Stephen F. Austin organized small, informal armed groups whose duties required them to range over the countryside, and who thus came to be known as \\"rangers\\". Around August 4, 1823, Austin wrote that he would \\" ... employ ten men ... to act as rangers for the common defense ... the wages I will give said ten men is fifteen dollars a month payable in property ... \\"Robinson, Charles, The Men Who Wear the Star: The Story of the Texas Rangers. John Jackson Tumlinson Sr., the first alcalde of the Colorado district, is considered by many historians of the Texas Rangers to be the first killed in the line of duty.[Transactions, Texas Lodge of Research, Captain Peter F. Tumlinson: Texian Ranger and Mason. Doyle, Brett Laird XXXIX (2004- 2005) 83-91.] While there is some discussion as to when Austin actually employed men as \\"rangers\\", Texas Ranger lore dates the anniversary year of their organization to this event.Cox, Mike, The Texas Rangers. However, the Texas Rangers were not formally constituted until 1835. Austin returned to Texas after having been imprisoned in Mexico City and helped organize a council to govern the group. On October 17, at a consultation of the Provisional Government of Texas, Daniel Parker proposed a resolution to establish the Texas Rangers. He proposed creating three companies that would total some 60 men and would be known by \\"uniforms\\" consisting of a light duster and an identification badge made from a Mexican peso. They were instituted by Texan lawmakers on November 24. On November 28, 1835, Robert McAlpin Williamson was chosen to be the first Major of the Texas Rangers. Within two years the Rangers grew to more than 300 men. In their early days, Rangers performed tasks of protecting the Texas frontier against Indian attacks on the settlers. During the Texas Revolution, they served mainly as scouts, spies, couriers, and guides for the settlers fleeing before the Mexican Army and performed rear guard during the Runaway Scrape and general support duties. These minor roles continued after independence, when the region became the Republic of Texas under President Sam Houston. Houston, who had lived with the Cherokee for many years (and who had taken a Cherokee wife), favored peaceful coexistence with Indians, a policy that left little space for a force with the Rangers' characteristics. This situation changed radically when Mirabeau B. Lamar became president of the Republic of Texas in December 1838. Lamar had participated in skirmishes with the Cherokee in his home state of Georgia; like most Texians, he had not forgotten the support the Cherokee had given the Mexicans in the C√≥rdova Rebellion against the Republic. He favored the eradication of Indians in Texas‚Äîa view that he shared with Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Thomas Rusk. Lamar saw in the Rangers the perfect tool for the task, and he obtained permission from the Texas Legislature to raise a force of 56 Rangers, along with other volunteer companies. During the following three years, he engaged the Rangers in a war against the Cherokee and the Comanche and succeeded in weakening their territorial control.Webb, Walter Prescott, The Texas Rangers: A Century of Frontier Defense. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Sam Houston was re-elected President of Texas on December 12, 1841. He had taken note of the Rangers' cost-efficiency and increased their number to 150. Under Captain John Coffee \\"Jack\\" Hays' leadership, the force played an important role in the defense against the Mexican invasion led by General Adrian Woll in 1842 and against attacks by Indians. Despite his youth at the time, the charismatic Hays was a rallying figure to his men and is often considered responsible for giving cohesion, discipline and a group mentality to the Rangers. Flacco, a chief of the allied Indian tribe of the Lipan, used to call Hays Bravo too much.O'Neal, Bill, Captain Jack Hays, Texas Ranger Dispatch Magazine, the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum, issue 1, 2000. The adoption of the state-of-the-art five- shot Colt Paterson revolver (which had been turned down by the U.S. Army) was also his work. Hays trained his men to aim, fire and reload their weapons from horseback, a radical innovation from the usual contemporary technique of dismounting before shooting at enemies and reloading, which was a necessity with more cumbersome weaponry. This tactic was put to devastating effect, and it was imitated shortly afterwards by the military, Texian and American.Circelli, Jerry, Lawmen of the Old West , Western Horsemen Story. Retrieved March 26, 2007. At the suggestion of one of Hays's officers, Samuel Hamilton Walker, these revolvers soon evolved into the famous, enhanced six- shot version, the Walker Colt; 1,000 of these revolvers were issued to the United States Mounted Rifles engaged in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.\\"Colt Firearms from 1836\\" Copyright 1979 by James E. Serven . During these years, famous Rangers such as Hays, Walker, Benjamin McCulloch and William \\"Bigfoot\\" Wallace first established their reputation as frontier fighters. Texas Ranger on horseback, ca. 1846. With the annexation of Texas within the United States and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846, several companies of Rangers were mustered into federal service and proved themselves at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. From that moment on, their effectiveness as guerrilla fighters and guides to the federal army through a territory that they were familiar with marked the pace of the American offensive. Rangers played an important role in the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista. The army, commanded by General Winfield Scott, landed at Veracruz in March 1847, and the Rangers once again provided valuable support at the ensuing Siege of Veracruz and the battles of Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. They were also responsible for the defeat of the fierce Mexican guerrilleros that hindered the advance of the federal troops, which they achieved ruthlessly and efficiently. By then, the Rangers had earned themselves a considerable reputation that approached the legendary among Mexicans, and when Ranger companies entered and occupied Mexico City with the U.S. Army in September 1847, los Diablos Tejanos (the \\"Texas Devils\\") were received with reverence and fear.Ford, John Salmon, Rip Ford's Texas. Their role in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War also won them nationwide fame in the United States and news of their exploits, in the contemporary press became common, effectively establishing the Rangers as part of American folklore. As the Victoria Advocate reported in the November 16, 1848, issue: > Four newly raised ranging companies, have all been organized, and taken > their several stations on our frontier. We are much pleased. We know they > are true men, and they know exactly what they are about. With many of them > Indian and Mexican fighting has been their trade for years. That they may be > permanently retained in the service on our frontier is extremely desirable, > and we cannot permit ourselves to doubt such will be the case.Cox, Mike, > Texas Ranger Tales: Stories That Need Telling. Despite these popular stories and their fame, some of their most brutal interventions, such as the massacre of unarmed civilians, elderly men, women and children in Saltillo, ordered by Samuel H. Walker, remained unknown to the American public at large. Most of the Ranger force was disbanded during the years following the end of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War on February 2, 1848, since the protection of the frontiers was now an official duty of the U.S. Army. But as more settlers sought to establish homesteads in lands traditionally occupied by Indians, the skirmishes with the native peoples became a major political issue. During the 1850s, the Rangers were intermittently called on to deal with this problem, and with the election of Hardin Richard Runnels as governor in 1857, they once again regained their role as defenders of the Texas frontier. On January 27, 1858, Runnels allocated $70,000 to fund a force of Rangers, and John Salmon \\"Rip\\" Ford, a veteran Ranger of the war with Mexico, was commissioned as senior captain. With a force of some 100 Rangers, Ford began a large expedition against the Comanche and other tribes, whose raids against the settlers and their properties had become common. On May 12, Ford's Rangers, accompanied by Tonkawa, Anadarko and Shawnee scouts from the Brazos Reservation in Texas, crossed the Red River into Indian Territory and attacked a Comanche village in the Canadian River Valley, flanked by the Antelope Hills in what is now Oklahoma. Suffering only four casualties, the force killed a reported 76 Comanche (including a chief by the name of Iron Jacket) and took 18 prisoners and 300 horses. In December 1859, Ford and his company were assigned to Brownsville, in south Texas, where the local Mexican rancher Juan Cortina had launched an attack and briefly occupied the town and later conducted a series of guerrilla actions and raids against local American landowners. Together with a regiment of the U.S. Army commanded by Major Samuel P. Heintzelman (who later became a notable general of the Union in the Civil War), Ford's Rangers took part in the Cortina War, and on December 27, 1859, they engaged and defeated Cortina's forces in the battle of Rio Grande City. Pursued and defeated by Ford and his Rangers again a few days later, Cortina retreated into Mexico, and although he would continue to promote minor actions against the Texan ranchers, the threat of a large-scale military incursion was effectively ended. The success of these campaigns marked a turning point in Rangers' history. The U.S. Army could provide only limited and thinly stretched protection in the enormous territory of Texas. In contrast, the Rangers' effectiveness when dealing with these threats convinced both the people of the state and the political leaders that a well-funded and organized local Ranger force was essential. Such a force could use the deep familiarity with the territory and the proximity with the theater of operations as major advantages in its favor. This option was not pursued in the light of the emerging national political problems, and the Rangers dissolved until 1874. However, the conviction of their usefulness had become firmly established, and the agency was eventually reconstituted.Wilkins, Frederick, Defending the Borders: The Texas Rangers, 1848‚Äì1861. Civil War and late 19th century After Texas seceded from the United States in 1861 during the American Civil War, many Rangers enlisted individually to fight for the Confederacy, such as Walter P. Lane, George W. Baylor, Thomas S. Lubbock, Benjamin McCulloch, Henry Eustace McCulloch, John B. Jones, Leander H. McNelly and John Ford. Although the famous Eighth Texas Cavalry regiment was widely known as Terry's Texas Rangers, neither its leader and founder, Benjamin Franklin Terry, nor the majority of its members had been affiliated with the state agency. The fact that both groups have often been regarded as related (and Terry's men themselves had thus adopted the organization's name) speaks of the widespread fame that the Rangers had achieved by that time. During the Civil War, the duties of scouting the state frontiers for Union troops, hostile Indians and deserters devolved upon those who could not be drafted into the Confederate Army because of their age or other disabilities. This mixed group was never officially considered a Ranger force, although their work was essentially the same. In April 1865 General John A. Wharton of the \\"Terry's Texas Rangers\\" was shot and killed after an argument with George W. Baylor-who served in the Texas Rangers Frontier Battalion after the Civil War until 1882. During Reconstruction, the Rangers were replaced by a Union- controlled version of the Rangers aka the Texas State Police. Charged with enforcing unpopular new laws that came with reintegration, that organization fell into disrepute.Webb, Walter Prescott, The Texas Rangers: A Century of Frontier Justice, University of Texas Press, 1965, second edition, pp. 219-229. The TSP only existed from July 22, 1870 to April 22, 1873. The scenario changed radically for the Rangers with the state election of 1873. When newly elected Governor Richard Coke took office in January 1874, it marked the end of Reconstruction for the Lone Star State, and he vigorously restored order to Texas in pursuit of improvements to both the economy and security. Once again Indians and Mexican bandits were threatening the frontiers, and once again the Rangers were tasked with solving the problem. That same year, the state legislature authorized the recommissioning of the Rangers,Utley, Robert M., Lone Star Justice: The First Century of the Texas Rangers, Berkley Books, 2003, p. 144. and a special force was created within its aegis: the Frontier Battalion, consisting of six companies of 75 men each under the command of Major John B. Jones. This group played a major role in the control of ordinary criminals as well as the defense against hostile Indian tribes, which was particularly necessary in the period of lawlessness and social collapse of the Reconstruction. The Frontier Battalion was soon augmented with the Special Force, a second military group of 40 men under Captain Leander H. McNelly, with the specific task of bringing order in the area of south Texas between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, called the Nueces Strip. At this particular region, the general situation of lawlessness was aggravated by the proximity of Texas to Mexico and the conflict between agrarian and cattle interests. Raids along the frontier were common, and not only perpetrated by ordinary bandits but also promoted by local Mexican caudillos. In particular, Juan Cortina's men were again conducting periodic guerrilla operations against local ranchers. In the following two years, McNelly and his group energetically engaged these threats and virtually eradicated them.Wilkins, Frederick, The Law Comes to Texas: The Texas Rangers 1870‚Äì1901. A second sergeant of J. R. Waller's Company \\"A\\" was Dallas Stoudenmire, later El Paso Police Chief and Deputy U.S. Marshal. Members of the Frontier Battalion, a company of Texas Rangers, ca. 1885Captain Frank Jones killed 1893 is 3rd from right front row It was at these times that many of the Rangers' myths were born, such as their success in capturing or killing notorious criminals and desperados (including bank robber Sam Bass and gunfighter John Wesley Hardin) and their decisive role in the defeat of the Comanche, the Kiowa and the Apache peoples. It was also during these years that the Rangers suffered the only defeat in their history when they surrendered at the Salinero Revolt in 1877. Despite the fame of their deeds, the conduct of the Rangers during this period was questionable. In particular, McNelly and his men used ruthless methods that often rivaled the brutality of their opponents, such as taking part in summary executions and confessions induced by torture and intimidation.Parsons, Chuck & Hall Little, Marianne E., Captain L. H. McNelly, Texas Ranger: The Life and Times of a Fighting Man. McNelly also made himself famous for disobeying direct orders from his superiors on several occasions, and breaking through the Mexican frontier for self-appointed law enforcement purposes.Parsons, Chuck & Hall Little, Marianne E., ibid. Arguably, these methods either sowed the seeds of discontent among Mexican-Americans or restored order to the frontier. After McNelly's retirement because of health problems, the Special Force was dissolved in 1877 and their members absorbed into the Frontier Battalion, which continued to function even after Jones's death in the line of duty in 1881. By the last years of the 19th century, a high measure of security within the vast frontier of Texas had been achieved, in which the Rangers had played a primary role. In 1891, Governor James Stephen Hogg named Captain Bill McDonald to succeed Samuel A. McMurry as the captain of Texas Rangers Company B, Frontier Battalion, a position that he retained until 1907. Over the years, McDonald became the best known of the Rangers during his lifetime and the subject of two major biographies. Taft-Diaz Assassination Attempt In 1909, Private C.R. Moore of Company A, \\"performed one of the most important feats in the history of the Texas Rangers\\". William Howard Taft and Porfirio D√≠az planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico, an historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, a nephew of Texas Ranger John Coffee Hays, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D√≠az. Mexican Revolution and early 20th century At the beginning of the 20th century, Texas's frontiers had become more settled, thus rendering the 1874 legislation obsolete after the organization had existed as a quasi-military force for more than 25 years. Amidst serious legal troubles that questioned the authority of the Rangers to exert such a role, new resolutions appropriate to the current times were adopted. The Frontier Battalion was disbanded with the passing of new legislation on July 8, 1901, and a new Ranger force was created, consisting of four companies of \\"no more than 20 men each\\" with a captain in command of every unit. The Rangers had evolved into an agency with an exclusive law enforcement focus. The Mexican Revolution that began in 1910 against Mexican President D√≠az changed the relatively peaceful state of affairs along the border. Soon after, violence on both sides of the frontier escalated as bands of Mexicans took over border towns and began crossing the Rio Grande on a near-daily basis. Taking over trade routes in Mexico by establishing themselves as road agents, Mexican banditos turned towards attacking the American communities for kidnapping, extortion, and supplies. As Mexican law enforcement disintegrated with the collapse of the Diaz regime, these gangs grouped themselves under the various caudillos on both sides of the border and took sides in the civil war, most simply to take advantage of the turmoil to loot.Cox, Mike, op. cit. Then, as the lack of American military forces for defending the border became clearer, the scope of the activities soon turned to outright genocide with the intention of driving Americans out of the Southwest entirely; this became known as the Plan de San Diego in 1915. In several well-rehearsed attacks, Mexicans rose up and in conjunction with raiding Villista guerrillas, within weeks had killed over 500 Texan women, children, and men.Johnson, Benjamin Herber, op. cit. The political decision of the Texans was to restore control and order by any necessary means. As Governor Oscar Branch Colquitt instructed Ranger Captain John R. Hughes, \\" ... you and your men are to keep Mexican raiders off of Texas territory if possible, and if they invade the State let them understand they do so at the risk of their lives.\\"Cox, Mike, ibid. Hundreds of new special Rangers were appointed by order of the state, which neglected to carefully screen aspiring members. Rather than conduct themselves as law enforcement officers, many of these groups acted more like vigilante squads. Reports of Rangers abusing their authority and breaking the law themselves increased.Harris, Charles H. III & Sadler, Louis R., The Texas Rangers And The Mexican Revolution: The Bloodiest Decade, 1910‚Äì1920. The situation grew even more dramatic when on March 9, 1916, Pancho Villa led 500 Mexican raiders in a cross-border attack against Columbus, New Mexico, increasing the high tension that had already existed between the communities. Villa and General Ramon Banda Quesada, in an attack against the town that was garrisoned by a detachment of the 13th Cavalry Regiment (United States), seized 100 horses and mules, burned the town, killed 14 soldiers and 10 residents, and took ammunition and weaponry before retreating back into Mexico. Quesada had five men captured and suffered the loss of 80 dead or mortally wounded, mostly from the U.S. machine gun emplacements. The final straw was the Porvenir Massacre, involving the killing of innocent villagers wrongly accused of raiding the Brite Ranch Store on Christmas Day in 1917. In January 1918 a heavily armed group of Texas Rangers, ranchmen and members a troop of U.S. Cavalry descended upon the tiny community of Porvenir, Texas on the Mexican border in western Presidio County. The Rangers and company rounded up the inhabitants of the village and searched their homes. They then proceeded to gather all the men in Porvenir (fifteen Mexican men and boys ranging in age from 16 to 72 years) and march them off into the darkness. A short distance from Porvenir, the men were lined up against a rock bluff and shot to death.Cynthia E. Orozco, \\"Porvenir Massacre,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, accessed March 10, 2016 Before the decade was over, thousands of lives were lost, Texans and Mexicans alike. In January 1919, at the initiative of Representative Jos√© T. Canales of Brownsville, the Texas Legislature launched a full investigation of Rangers' actions throughout these years. The investigation found that from 300 up to 5,000 people, mostly of Hispanic descent, had been killed by Rangers from 1910 to 1919, and that members of the Rangers had been involved in many acts of brutality and injustice.Harris, Charles H. III & Sadler, Louis R., ibid. These were the most turbulent times in the history of the Rangers, and with the objective of recycling the force's membership, putting it back in tune with its past and restoring the public's trust, the Legislature passed on March 31, 1919, a resolution to purge it and enhance it and its procedures. All special Ranger groups were disbanded; the four official companies were kept, albeit their members were reduced from 20 to 15 each; better payment was offered in order to attract men of higher personal standards; and a method for citizens to articulate complaints against any further misdeeds or abuses was established. The reforms proved positive, and the new Ranger force eventually regained the status of a respectable agency. Under the command of captains such as Frank Hamer (who later became famous for leading the party that killed the outlaws Bonnie and Clyde), the Rangers displayed remarkable activity in the following years, including the continuous fighting of cattle rustlers, intervening in the violent labor disputes of the time and protecting the citizenry involved in Ku Klux Klan's public displays from violent mob reaction. With the passage of the Volstead Act and the beginning of nationwide prohibition on January 16, 1920, their duties extended to scouting the border for tequila smugglers and detecting and dismantling the illegal stills that abounded along Texas's territory. One of the Rangers' highest-profile interventions during this period was taming Texas's oil boomtowns (beginning with Spindletop's discovery in 1901), which had developed into lawless territories. During the 1920s, martial law was decreed on several of these towns, such as Mexia and Borger; at others, like Desdemona, Wink, Ranger, Kilgore and Burkburnett, the situation was also very serious, and the Rangers were called in to quell agitated locals and terminate all illegal activities. This trouble continued until well in the 1950s, but the Rangers prevented it from growing into an even more dramatic problem. At Borger, a total of ten officers were sent on April 7, 1927, including Captain Hamer. The balance of the Rangers' activities upon their arrival as reported was: :A thorough-going clean-up was put underway. The liquor traffic was broken up, many stills being seized and destroyed, and several thousand gallons of whiskey being captured and poured out. Two hundred and three gambling slot machines were seized and destroyed, and in a period of twenty four hours, no less than twelve hundred prostitutes left the town of Borger. Modernization and present day The Great Depression forced both the federal and state governments to cut down on personnel and funding of their organizations, and the Rangers were no exception. The number of commissioned officers was reduced to 45, and the only means of transportation afforded to Rangers were free railroad passes, or using their personal horses. The situation worsened for the agency when its members entangled themselves in politics in 1932 by publicly supporting Governor Ross Sterling in his re-election campaign, over his opponent Miriam Amanda \\"Ma\\" Ferguson. Ferguson was elected, and immediately after taking office in January 1933, she proceeded to discharge all serving Rangers. The force also saw its salaries and funds slashed by the Texas Legislature, and their numbers reduced further to 32 men. The result was that Texas became a safe hideout for the many Depression-era gangsters escaping from the law, such as Bonnie and Clyde, George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd and Raymond Hamilton. The hasty appointment of many unqualified Rangers to stop the increasing criminality proved ineffective.Webb, Walter Prescott, op. cit. The general disorganization of law enforcement in the state convinced the members of the Legislature that a thorough revision of the public security system was in order, and with that purpose it hired the services of a consulting firm from Chicago. The resulting report yielded many worrying conclusions, but the basic underlying facts were simple: the criminality levels in Texas were extremely high, and the state's means to fight them were underfunded, undermanned, loose, disorganized and obsolete. The consultants' recommendation, besides increasing funding, was to introduce a whole reorganization of state security agencies; especially, to merge the Rangers with the Texas Highway Patrol under a new agency called the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). After deliberating, the Legislature agreed with the suggestion. The resolution that created the new state law enforcement agency was passed in 1935, and with an initial budget of $450,000, the DPS became operational on August 10. With minor rearrangements over the years, the 1935 reforms have ruled the Texas Rangers' organization until present day. Hiring new members, which had been largely a political decision, was achieved through a series of examinations and merit evaluations. Promotion relied on seniority and performance in the line of duty. More sophisticated means of crime fighting were put at their disposal, like automobiles, advanced weaponry and forensics. By the late 1930s, the Rangers had one of the best crime labs in the United States at the Headquarters Division in Austin. The appointment of Colonel Homer Garrison in September 1938 as director of the DPS proved decisive as well. Under his leadership, many respected captains such as Manuel T. Gonzaullas worked extensively to restore the good name of the force that had been compromised in the previous decades, keeping it in line with its traditions within a modern and civilized society and regaining its high status. The number of commissioned officers grew and the Rangers developed a clear detective function, while the Highway Patrol took charge of direct law enforcement duties. The quality of the force in terms of training, funding, modernization and number strength has continued to improve. In the last few decades, the Rangers have intervened in several thousand cases with a high level of effectiveness,. Retrieved October 13, 2005. including many high- profile ones such as the pursuit and capture of serial killer √Ångel Maturino Res√©ndiz. The agency is also fully integrated with modern Texan ethnic groups, counting numerous officers of Hispanic and African American origin among its members. Today, the historical importance and symbolism of the Texas Rangers is such that they are protected by statute from being disbanded.\\"The division relating to the Texas Rangers may not be abolished\\" - Acts 1987, 70th Leg., ch. 147, Sec. 1, September 1, 1987.

Biography Pynacker was the son of a wine merchant, who was a member of the vroedschap, or city regency. He travelled to Italy and was gone for three years. In 1658 he converted to Catholicism in order to marry Eva Maria de Geest, Wybrand de Geest's daughter. Two years later his portrait was painted by his father-in-law as a pendant to an earlier portrait of his wife. In Schiedam he baptized two children, but from 1661 until he died, he lived on the Rozengracht in Amsterdam. Wedding portraits De Geest was a highly successful portrait painter who painted his daughter in 1652 and two years after their marriage he painted his new son-in-law's portrait in a matching style as pendant: File:Wybrand de Geest - Adam Joseph Pynacker.jpg|Adam Pynacker, by his father-in-law File:Wybrand de Geest - Eva de Geest.jpg|Eva de Geest, Pynnacker's wife Legacy Landscape with a herd of goats, St. Louis Art Museum. Pynacker is considered an example of an Italianate landscape painter, along with Jan Both, Jan Baptist Weenix, Nicolaes Berchem and Jan Asselyn. He specialized in decorating whole rooms. According to Houbraken, he would turn in his grave if he knew how the fashions had changed, but the poet P.

The mine is owned and operated by Agnico- Eagle Mines Limited and is located north-east of Kittil√§. Exploration began in 1986, and production started in 2008. The mine is composed of two open pits, with the proceeds of the operation funding an underground mining operation, accessed by a ramp from surface and utilizing both transverse and longitudinal long-hole stoping methods. The mine utilizes on-site concentrating to produce Dor√© bars for shipment off-site for refinement, and is scheduled to produce of gold in 2009. History In 1986 gold was discovered near the town of Kittil√§. The Geological Survey of Finland initiated exploration which resulted in a discovery of gold mineralization. Diamond drilling continued up to 1991, when exploration ended. In 1998 the property was sold to Svenska Platina AB, a junior mining company which was a subsidiary of Riddarhyttan Resources AB. Permitting for an open pit mine began in 2002, with a mining licence and permit secured in 2003. Agnico Eagle purchased a stake in Riddarhyttan (at the time feasibility studies suggested the resource was between 2‚Äî3.7 million ounces of gold) in 2004, with the remainder of the company being purchased in 2005. Diamond drilling continued in 2005, with an additional 460 holes drilled over . In September 2008 an additional of drilling resulted in a gold reserve increase of two million ounces (5.7 million ounces total), over 18.2 million tonnes of ore, grading 5.12 grams per tonne. Excavation of the open pit began in September 2007 and ore production began in May 2008. Mining in the Suuri pit began at per day to be increased to by the end of 2009. Mining operation Open pit Caterpillar 777 The ore zone at the Kittil√§ mine (mined by what are known as the Suuri and Roura pits) is approximately long, wide, deep. Drilling is done using both Sandvik and Atlas Copco drill rigs, with ore being loaded into Caterpillar 777 dump trucks (pictured) by Caterpillar 385 hydraulic excavators. Mining in the pits is expected to last for up to five years. Proceeds from the pits are being used to finance the underground mining operation. The pit produces of material per month, removing eight tons of waste per ton of ore. Provided they are able to acquire larger trucks, Agnico will increase their monthly tonnage to . Underground Underground development began in October 2006. Access tunnels are wide, which will permit the use of haul trucks up to 60-tonne capacity. Underground mining will be done using long-hole stoping methods, either along strike (longitudinal) in the case of narrow areas (less than ), and perpendicular (transverse) to the ore body in the case of wider zones. Levels are designed to be apart (from the floor to floor). Processing The mill at the Kittila mine begins with a crusher and semi-autogenous grinding mill (SAG Mill), where ore is sized to . The ore is then sent to flotation cells where the gold (located in sulphide material) is separated from gangue material. The concentrated ore is sent to an autoclave, and heated to 190|C at a pressure of . This heat and the addition of oxygen separates the gold from the sulphide material. The separated material is then leached out using carbon. The carbon is removed from the leached material and the gold is smelted into Dor√© bars, which are sent off-site for further refining. Kittila realizes an average gold recovery of 92%, and has the capacity to produce up to four bars per week. The Kittila mill also includes a bomb shelter, a legal requirement under a 1917 Finnish law which came into effect following Finnish independence from Russia. The shelter is open for viewing by visitors and contains emergency supplies such as oxygen tanks, food, drink and a set of golf clubs.

NDFLOAG was supported by urban intellectuals. Ideologically, PFLOAG was Marxist whilst NDFLOAG was Ba'ath-oriented. When it was publicly launched, NDFLOAG had branches in different towns in Oman and in most of the other parts of the Persian Gulf.Allen, Calvin H., and W. Lynn Rigsbee.

The attack on a SAF army post outside Izki was repelled, and the entire unit was either killed or captured. Afterwards several arrests were made, based on testimonies from prisoners from the Izki raid, and three NDFLOAG arms caches in Muti, Sur and Matrah had been stored was seized by the state forces. These crack-downs lead to a temporary ceasing of NDFLOAG activities in Oman. The group continued to organize outside Oman.Townsend, John. Oman: The Making of a Modern State.

It is bordered by the San Diego Bay on the east, Naval Base Point Loma on the south, the Wooded Area neighborhood to the west and Point Loma Village/Roseville-Fleetridge to the north.City of San Diego:Neighborhoods map It lies across a channel from Shelter Island. Description The bayside residential area now called La Playa lies somewhat north of the original La Playa, where commercial and military ships anchored during the early days of the city. The La Playa neighborhood includes some of the most expensive homes in San Diego. The neighborhood is mostly residential and contains two yacht clubs, San Diego Yacht Club and Southwestern Yacht Club. Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats. Old La Playa United States Boundary Survey of the San Diego, California area, 1850, showing the La Playa Trail from La Playa to Old San Diego and the Mission The original area known as La Playa played an important role in the early history of San Diego. The first European to set foot in what is now California, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, came ashore in 1542 at La Playa, probably at a small rocky peninsula called Ballast Point.Cabrillo Festival website When a permanent European settlement was established a few miles inland in 1769, La Playa served as the town's \\"harbor\\", actually an anchorage where cargo was loaded and unloaded via small boats. Goods were then transported to the settlement by land over the historic La Playa Trail, the oldest European trail on the West Coast.Historic La Playa Trail Association website The anchorage at La Playa continued to serve as San Diego‚Äôs main port until the establishment of New Town (current downtown) in the 1870s.Engstrand, Iris Wilson, California‚Äôs Cornerstone, Sunbelt Publications, Inc., 2005, p. 80 In his book Two Years Before the Mast, Richard Henry Dana, Jr. describes how sailors in the 1830s camped on the beach at La Playa and hunted for wood and rabbits in the hills of Point Loma. The beach at La Playa became an informal town of up to 800 people during the Mexican years (1822-1846), centered on a dozen or so huge \\"hide houses\\" where cattle hides were processed and stored until they could be exported for sale. The hide houses were named for the Boston trading ships they served. The first and best known was the Brookline captained by James O. Locke, where the American flag was first raised over California (unofficially) in 1829. The La Playa harbor hosted vessels from almost every maritime nation in the world during this period. The Old La Playa site was registered as California Historical Landmark #61 in 1932, and designated as a historical landmark by the San Diego Historical Resources Board in 1970.City of San Diego website. The original La Playa landing place and Ballast Point are now on the grounds of Naval Base Point Loma. Nothing visible remains of the original sites, which are accessible to the public during the annual Cabrillo Festival and to scholars for occasional archeological digs. A lighthouse stood on Ballast Point from 1890 to 1960; currently there is a simple automated light on the site.

The incident took place on a Boeing 737-205 belonging to Braathens SAFE that was on a scheduled flight from Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The hijacker was Stein Arvid Huseby, who was drunk during most of the incident. It was the first plane hijacking to take place in Norway; there were no deaths and no injuries. Huseby was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and five years' detention. Armed with an air gun, Huseby threatened a cabin attendant and told the captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board. His demands were to make a political statement and talk to Prime Minister K√•re Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona R√∏kke. The plane landed at 15:30 at Fornebu and was surrounded by the police. After one hour, Huseby released 70 hostages in exchange for having the aircraft being moved closer to the terminal building. Thirty minutes later, Huseby released the remaining passengers. He drank throughout the incident, and at 17:30, after he consumed the plane's beer supply, he surrendered his weapon in exchange for more beer. The plane was immediately stormed and Huseby arrested. Hijacking The hijacking occurred on board Braathens SAFE Flight 139 en route from Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The aircraft was a Boeing 737‚Äì205, named Harald Gille (after Harald IV of Norway) with registration LN-SUG. The day before the hijacking, Huseby graduated from upper secondary school, where he studied health and social work. That evening, he purchased an air gun in Trondheim. The weapon was in his hand luggage when boarding the aircraft at Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes, where there was no security control. He selected a seat at the rear of the aircraft. While airborne, the hijacker showed a female flight attendant the air gun, and asked her to inform the captain that he wanted control over the aircraft, but that otherwise all was to proceed as planned. The flight attendant and later the hijacker used the intercom to communicate with the pilot. The police were informed about the incident via air controllers at 15:05. The hijacker demanded to speak to Prime Minister K√•re Willoch (image) The plane landed at Fornebu at 15:30, fifteen minutes after schedule. The aircraft parked at a location from the terminal. It was immediately surrounded by police special forces, as well as officers from Asker and B√¶rum Police Department. Two special-trained police officers were placed in the control tower, where they negotiated with Huseby. Fornebu was closed, and air traffic was rerouted to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The passengers were not informed about the incident until the aircraft was surrounded by the police. The hijacker informed the passengers and crew falsely that he had placed explosives in the toilet rooms, but that no one would be hurt if they cooperated. Huseby was dressed in a suit with sunglasses. The passengers on board described his actions as calm. During the whole incident, Huseby repeatedly asked for and drank beer. Huseby's demands were to talk to Prime Minister K√•re Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona R√∏kke, both from the Conservative Party. He also wanted to hold a press conference at Fornebu. Huseby was unsatisfied with his treatment after he left prison. He demanded to receive guarantees for a better treatment and economic security from the authorities. Assisted by a psychologist, the police negotiated with Huseby. One hour after the plane landed, 70 passengers were let out of the plane. The first group were those passengers who had or claimed they had transfers to other flights. In exchange, the aircraft was moved closer to the terminal building. The passengers were picked up by a bus and transported to the domestic terminal, where they were questioned by the police. The remaining passengers were let out thirty minutes later. Only the five crew members remained. A friend of Huseby helped the police in the negotiations. At 18:30, the aircraft was out of beer, so Huseby made an agreement that he would throw the gun out of the window in exchange for more beer. This was delivered by a civilian police officer. The aircraft was then immediately stormed by special forces and Huseby arrested. No-one was injured in the hijacking. Aftermath Stein Arvid Huseby, originally from Karm√∏y, was at the time 24 years old. He had just finished studying at a Christian upper secondary school in Trondheim. He had previously been sentenced five times for violence offenses, including an armed robbery of a taxi and threatening a lensmann with a shotgun. He was beaten and abused by his father, and started drinking as a 13-year-old. He lost his job as a seaman due to drunkenness, and was put into a psychiatric institution in 1980, aged 19. In 1983, he was admitted to a Christian school, and had managed to stay away from alcohol for two years, but had started again just prior to the incident. He stated that he was afraid to lose his friends due to his misuse of alcohol. During the court case, Huseby stated that he wanted help from society and attention drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated that all he wanted was to send a message to the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self- esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years in prison and five years of preventive supervision.

Honors and awards citations Distinguished Service Cross The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Arthur Edmund Easterbrook, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action near St. Mihiel, France, September 12, 1918. Because of intense aerial activity on the opening day of the St. Mihiel offensive, Lieutenant Easterbrook, observer, and Second Lieutenant Ralph E. De Castro, pilot, volunteered to fly over the enemy's lines on a photographic mission without the usual protection of accompanying planes. Notwithstanding the low-hanging clouds, which necessitated operation at an altitude of only 400 meters, they penetrated 4 kilometers beyond the German lines. Attacked by four enemy machines, they fought off their foes, completed their photographic mission, and returned safely.(General Orders No. 116, W.D., 1919) http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/easterbrook.php Retrieved on 11 April 2010.

Its name is derived from the Lower Saxon word Fast, which means an area of upland that descends on two sides.  Geographical location  The Elfas is located in the middle of the Leine Uplands between the Hils to the north, the Homburg Forest to the west, the Hube to the east, the Amtsberge to the south-southwest and the Holzberg to the southwest. It lies not far southwest of Eschershausen and east of Stadtoldendorf; the town of Einbeck is about 12 km southeast of the Elfas. The B 64 federal highway runs past the Elfas to the north linking Eschershausen with Einbeck. The rounded summits of the Elfas are covered by acidic soil beech forests.  Geology  The Elfas is mainly composed of sandstones from the Bunter sandstone period. As the result of a halokinetic process, which had already been concluded in the Palaeogene period, the Elfas fault block migrated in a north-easterly direction towards the Solling, whereby the mountain-building sandstone rode up over a layer of saliniferous rock of the Zechstein. In the course of this process, mainly older rock strata that had hitherto lain underneath, were overthrust. Out of the subsequent erosion processes today's scarpland emerged as the northern boundary of the Einbeck- Markoldendorf Basin. Geologists in the Weser Uplands also use the terms Elfas Axis (Elfas-Achse) or Elfas Fault (Elfas-√úberschiebung) for the regional fault line, as well as the term Elfas Saddle.  Hills  The hills in the Elfas include (heights in metres above NN): * Helleberg (409.6 m) * Ahrensberg (405 m) * Kneppelberg (386.0 m) * Birkenberg (366.4 m) * Vorwohler Berg (360.2 m) * Moosberg (344.7 m) * Eichholzberg (341.5 m) * D√∂hrenberg (307.1 m) * Eimer Berg (ca. 300 m) * Kurzeberg (299.0 m) * B√∂hneberg (290.0 m) * Heisennacken (267.0 m)  Streams  The streams of the Elfas include: * Allerbach (eastern tributary of the Bewer) * Bewer (northern tributary of the Ilme) * Hillebach (northern tributary of the Krummes Wasser) * Lenne (passes the Elfas to the west)  References  Georg Schambach: W√∂rterbuch der niederdeutschen Mundart, 1858, p. 257 Axel Herrmann, Carsten Hinze, Volker Stein: Die halokinetische Deutung der Elfas-√úberschiebung im s√ºdnieders√§chsischen Bergland, in: Geologisches Jahrbuch 84, 1967, pp. 407ff.

Its capacity was approximately 850 for baseball. The park was named for the nearby Coffee Pot Bayou. The field was also used by local high school teams and for amateur softball. The ballpark was replaced in 1922 by Waterfront Park as the home to spring training in St. Pete.

In 1966, Ken Goldman also wrote that the address of the ballpark had been at \\"First Street North and 22nd Avenue\\" which by today's map would place the park southwest of Coffee Pot Bayou. John C.

Spring Training St. Petersburg mayor Al Lang attracted the St. Louis Browns to the city in 1914. In the first game, the Chicago Cubs came by boat across the bay from their spring home in Tampa. The Cubs beat the Browns 3-2, as 4,000 fans paid from 25 cents (for bleachers) to $1 (for a box seat). The Philadelphia Phillies trained at the ballpark from 1915 through 1918. Manager Pat Moran made the players walk the from their hotel in downtown St. Petersburg to the ballpark every day. Top minor league clubs used to hold their own spring training camps; the Indianapolis Indians trained at the ballpark in 1921. St. Petersburg Saints The Saint Petersburg Saints minor- league team played at the ballpark from as early as the 1914 season.

The court appointed attorneys for her parents: private practitioner Craig McCarthy for the mother, and a lawyer from the state Florida Regional Council for the father. As is the result in the vast majority of cases involving alleged child abuse, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement report was inconclusive, finding no hard evidence of physical or verbal abuse. In the report, Bary's father states that he did pick up his daughter's laptop to throw it, but did not throw it due to the cost of the laptop (Bary alleged that her father raised the laptop above her head as though ready to hit her with it). The FDLE report raised questions about one claim made by Bary: that her parents did not know she was a cheerleader. The FDLE report states that pictures of her in uniform were prominently displayed in the family's home three days later when the police visited and interviewed them, and that Mr. Bary signed the permission slip for her to be a cheerleader when Mrs. Bary would not. The FDLE report also stated that they did not investigate anyone in the larger Ohio Muslim community and that Florida authorities relied in part on the investigation done by authorities in Ohio.FDLE SEES NO DANGER FOR GIRL On October 13, 2009, Orange County (Florida) Judge Daniel P.

The village lies very close to Staffordshire's borders with Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire. In 2001 the parish had a population of 764, increasing to 912 at the 2011 census. In 1848 the parish included both Haunton and Harlaston, and also Chilcote in Derbyshire. Clifton itself then had a population of 341, while the population of the whole parish was 921 on . The core parish of Clifton and Haunton covered around in 1851. Nowadays the Church of England parish still includes Haunton and Chilcote, and also Statfold. There is a fine gothic church, dedicated to St Andrew, and listed Grade I. The village pub, The Green Man, is also a historic building. Etymology The first part of the name is Old English clif tun, that is cliff farm; the family de Camvill held the land in the early 13th century. The name has also been recorded as Clistone. Descent of the manor There is some evidence of pre-Saxon, or even pre-historic settlement in the area. After the Norman Conquest of 1066 the manor was in the royal demesne. The manor of Clistone is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having 33 villagers, a priest, 11 ploughs and 2 mills. One of the mills was possibly at Mill Farm. de Camville From 1200 it was held by the de Camville (or de Canville) family, at least until 1338, which originated probably at the Normandy manor of Canville-la-Rocque, in La Manche (not at Canville-les-Deux- √âglises in the Pays de Caux).G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.III, p.3, note c The arms of the de Camville family were: Azure, three lions passant argent.G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.III, p.3, note c The descent in the de Camville family was as follows: *William de Camville I, who married Auber√©e Marmion (fl.1233), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Marmion of Clifton and of Arrow, Warwickshire. (Dugdale and others erroneously state William and Auber√©e to have been the parents of the 1st Baron, rather than the great-grandparents, as noted in The Complete Peerage). *Geoffrey de Camville I (d.1219) of Clifton, who married twice: firstly to Felice de Worcester, a daughter of Philip de Worcester, from whom he was divorced due to consanguinity, having had a son Richard de Camville; Secondly he married Leuca de Braiose (d.1236), a grand-daughter of William de Braiose, of the marcher lords family. *William de Camville II (d.1260), 2nd son and heir (by his father's second wife Leuca de Braiose), of Clifton and of Llansteffan in Carmarthen, Wales and of Fedamore, County Limerick and Caher, County Tipperary, both in Ireland.

E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.III, pp.3-4 He was knighted after 1272. In 1282 he was serving in the army of West Wales and was summoned for military service from 1276 to 1308, and to attend the king from 1294 to 1297.G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.III, p.3 He married twice, firstly to Maud de Brian (1242- d.pre-1279), widow of Nicholas Martin (son and heir apparent of Nicholas FitzMartin of Kemes/Cemais in Pembrokeshire and feudal baron of BlagdonSanders, I.J. English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, p.15 in Somerset), a daughter of Guy de Brian of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, Wales, by his wife Eve de Tracy, daughter and heiress of Henry de Tracy, feudal baron of Barnstaple in Devon. On 24 September 1274 Geoffrey de Camville II gave homage to the king and received livery of the lands of Henry de Tracy, his first wife's maternal grandfather. Secondly he married a certain Joan. *William de Camville III, 2nd Baron Camville (1268-1338), of Clifton, son and heir, who died without male issue leaving five daughters and co-heiresses, between the descendants of whom the barony is deemed to be in abeyance: Monument to Sir John Vernon (d.1545) and his wife in St Andrew's Church, Clifton Campville **Maud de Camville, who married Richard de Vernon (d.1323), whom she survived into widowhood, son and heir apparent of Richard de Vernon of Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, who predeceased his father.

Other By 1700 it was in possession of the Coventry family, who sold it in that year to Sir Charles Pye, Baronet, whose descendant Henry John Pye owned the manor in 1851. Governance The parish of Clifton Campville formerly included Chilcote in Derbyshire, and Harlaston, as well as Haunton, which it still does. It became part of Tamworth Poor Law Union in 1836; in 1866 Harlaston became a civil parish in its own right. In 1894 Clifton with Haunton became a civil parish within the newly constituted Tamworth Rural District. The civil parish became part of Lichfield Rural District during the boundary changes of 1934. In 1974 it became part of the new non-metropolitan district of Lichfield. The parish council meets jointly with Thorpe Constantine. Electorally the parish is part of Mease and Tame ward of Lichfield District, and lies within the parliamentary constituency of Tamworth. Landmarks Clifton contains a number of listed buildings, including the Grade I listed Church of St Andrew, Clifton Hall, Manor Farm, the old Post Office and the village pub, the Green Man. There are also several historic buildings in Haunton. Church of St Andrew Church and monument at Clifton Campville The parish church, dedicated to St Andrew, is a Grade I listed building. Though nothing remains of the building mentioned in Domesday, some parts of the south wall date back to the year 1200, with traces of 13th century wall paintings. The church was enlarged into the shape of a cross in the first half of the 13th century. It was enlarged again in the 14th century. The tower was built in the first half of the 14th century, with a spire, reaching to a height of about 210 feet (65 m), added at some time during the century. The interior includes 14th century screens carved from oak; the rood screen is from the 15th century, as is some stained glass in one of the north windows. The church was restored by George Edmund Street in the second half of the 19th century, and again by W. D. Caroe in the early 20th century. In 1984 the spire was struck by lightning, with much damage to the church. Repairs were completed in 1987. The adjoining cemetery also dates back to mediaeval days. The Old Rectory is in origin a 15th-century building, though the history of the rectory can be traced further back, to the mid 14th century. The building was altered in 1694, and again in 1778, and restored in around 1980. It is listed Grade II. Education The village school is St Andrew's Church of England Controlled Primary School. In 2009 it had 63 pupils, and was rated as Outstanding by OFSTED. Other settlements The neighbouring village of Haunton, one mile (about 1.5 km) to the west, has historically been, and remains, part of the parish of Clifton Campville.

Soutman in the RKD was a Dutch Golden Age painter and printmaker from Haarlem.  Biography  Soutman was born and died in Haarlem, where he was a contemporary of Frans Hals, Hendrick Gerritsz Pot, and Pieter Claesz, and seems to have been influenced by all three, considering the various attributions of his paintings through the centuries. According to the RKD, he was the youngest of six children of the wealthy Catholic owner of the Haarlem beer brewery De Werelt. According to Houbraken, Soutmann trained with Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp. He must have been successful, because Samuel Ampzing mentions him in his poem about Haarlem.Pieter Soutman biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literatureAmpzing states he became the painter of the Prussian majesty due to his fame:Hoe zou hier ook de naam van Soutman zyn verzwegen, Die door zyn kloek penceel, zig heeft dien staat verkregen, Zig heeft door zyne Konst die eer en roem bereit, Dat hy de Schilder is der Pruische Majesteit. Probably during Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Vasa's visit to Antwerp in 1624, he was recommended by Rubens as an excellent painter. That same year he went to Poland, where he was appointed royal court painter. Soutman was employed as a servitor of the king Sigismund III Vasa until 1628, when he returned to Haarlem. His family connections enabled him to become affiliated with the Catholic Hofje Codde en Van Beresteijn. Today this is one hofje, but in his day it was two; the Hofje of Codde and the Hofje of Beresteijn. He was probably regent of the Codde hofje. Soutman became a respected portrait painter in Haarlem and won many commissions for group portraits, including lucrative schutterstukken. Legacy One of his portraits that he painted for the Beresteijn family (regents of both the Beresteijn and Codde hofjes) was later sold as a Frans Hals to the Louvre in the 1860s, but this was not from deception, but ignorance on the part of the hofje regents. This sale was considered a scandal in the Dutch press at the time, and Conrad Busken Huet wrote that the government should keep this national treasure in the country (he was living in Haarlem at the time). Soutman's work hangs today in various museums, and in the Huis ten Bosch in Den Haag. His pupils were Cornelis Visscher, Jacob Louys (1595-na 1635), and Pieter van Sompel.

As a young man Evans emigrated to Ontario to learn fruit farming. He enlisted in the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery during the Second Boer War, and served in South Africa for a year as part of \\"C\\" Battery. On returning to Canada he took up ranching near Macleod, Alberta, and also held a Government appointment as Range Rider. A keen sportsman and horseman, he was well known as a polo player, and was one of the early pioneers of the game in Western Canada. On 23 September 1914 at Valcartier, Quebec, he enlisted as a trooper in the 19th Alberta Dragoons, arriving in England with the 1st Canadian Contingent in November 1914. He served with the Dragoons in France from February until September 1915, was promoted to the rank of sergeant and was badly affected by poison gas. He was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps and commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant on 13 September 1915, and on 25 September joined No. 24 Squadron RAF in action at the front, not being officially gazetted as a flying officer (observer) until 22 November.

Evans was shot down and killed by German anti-aircraft fire on 3 September 1916 while on a morning offensive patrol over the British Fourth Army front.

Much of the overlook is lined with trap rock quarried from the cliffs. The view from Boulevard East is recognized worldwide. The Boulevard winds its way along the top of the Hudson Palisades as seen looking south in Guttenberg. Boulevard East (officially John F. Kennedy Boulevard East, and sometimes referred to as JFK Boulevard East) is a two-way, mostly two lane, scenic thoroughfare in the North Hudson, New Jersey municipalities of Weehawken, West New York, Guttenberg and North Bergen. Apart from small sections at either end, the road runs along the crest of the Hudson Palisades, affording it views of the Hudson River and the New York City skyline. Developed at the turn of the 20th century,\\"New Jersey Towns May Consolidate\\". The New York Times. June 18, 1911 the residential road is characterized by an eclectic mix of 20th-century architecture, including private homes as well as mid and high-rise apartment buildings, mostly on its western side, with a promenade and parks along its eastern side. It is also the setting for Edward Hopper's 1934 painting East Wind Over Weehawken, which is considered one of his best works. History Boulevard East is so named in reference to the other major boulevard in Hudson County to which it is connected, Kennedy Boulevard. Prior to being renamed in honor of John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, the street was known as Hudson Boulevard. While there was discussion of building a county long road as early as the 1870s, parts of Hudson County Boulevard were officially opened in 1896. By 1913 it was completed, and considered to be fine for \\"motoring\\". Taken as a single road, the circuitous route of west and east sections of the entire boulevard runs from the southern tip of the county at Bergen Point to its northern border with Bergen County and south again to the Hoboken city line. In local nomenclature, signage, addresses, transportation, and postal delivery, the name Boulevard East is used.Review of Boulevard East 07086 USPS Box\\"Welcome to Hudson County\\" . United Brokers. Accessed July 7, 2010 Route description Much of Boulevard East runs parallel to the edge of a sheer escarpment and offers expansive views the iconographic Manhattan skyline. Since 2009, when Macy's began to launch its annual Fourth of July fireworks from the Hudson River, portions of The Boulevard are closed to allow spectators to view the display.Kaulessar, Ricardo (June 27, 2010).

Assata. \\"Where to see Fourth of July fireworks\\". The Union City Reporter, pp. 1, 10 and 11 The Boulevard was proposed to be part of the Port Imperial Street Circuit of the Grand Prix of America. The southern end of the road is an important component of local access to the Lincoln Tunnel, running past its Art Deco toll plaza and passing twice under the helix which descends to meet it. Entering a residential district of Weehawken the boulevard steeply ascends northward until reaching the Boulevard Curve where it curves east, then north again and begins travelling along the edge of the Hudson Palisades. Just to the south of the curve is the Hamilton Memorial, relocated from the Burr-Hamilton duel site at the foot of the cliffs below Kings Bluff, named for James Gore King whose 19th century estate, Highwood, once stood there, and is now a residential neighborhood. The road then passes Hamilton Plaza where for a brief time in the 1890s stood El Dorado, a pleasure garden offering theatrical spectacles, casinos, and exotic gardens. At Liberty Place it crosses over a now defunct cut through which once ran streetcars operated by North Hudson County Railway that connected to a massive elevator and ferries at Weehawken Terminal. Pershing Road is one of the few roads which connect the waterfront to the Boulevard and the top of the cliffs, and was once part of the Lincoln Highway. At the southwest corner of 49th Street stands the gabled house depicted in East Wind Over Weehawken, a 1934 painting by Edward Hopper, which is considered one of his best works. Old Glory Park is near the town line of West New York where of the much boulevard is abutted by parks and scenic overlooks. A statue of Thomas M. Donnelly, instrumental in the preservation of the Palisades, is located in the park named for him. The trap rock walls that line much of the overlook come from quarry operations that he and the NJ Federation of Women's Clubs were able curtail at the beginning of the 20th century. 60th Street, the main crosstown street for the town became Hillside Road (officially renamed for Anthony DeFino, who was mayor for 24 yearsGibson, Denise. \\"Late West New York mayor inducted into Hall of Fame\\".

One of the few residential neighborhoods on the cliff side of the boulevard is found north of the major crossroad at one of its more severe curves. It is here that the road reaches a height of nearly 260 feet near the highest point in Hudson County.\\"Hudson County High Point, New Jersey\\". Peakbagger.com. Retrieved July 7, 2010. The park on 60th Street features a fountain erected in tribute to the victims of the September 11 Attacks.\\"Moments of silence\\". The Union City Reporter. September 11, 2005. p. 1 The three block section of the boulevard in Guttenberg is dominated by the Galaxy Towers, a Brutalist trio of octagonal buildings, which rise from the foot of the palisades and soar above them. Ferry Road passes underneath the complex. The Woodcliff Section of North Bergen, once known as Hudson Heights, is characterized by a combination of family homes and modernist high-rises, notably the round Stonehenge. Near the point where the road bears west and enters North Hudson Park the original Bulls Ferry Road makes a steep descent to the east. It is in the park, also named for famous son James J. Braddock, that Boulevard East intersects with Palisades Avenue, which continues north along the cliffs, and soon after ends at Bergenline in Nungessers. There are numerous bridges along Boulevard East crossing over clefts in the cliffs, many approaching 100 years in age. A portion of the road was closed for six months in 2013 to replace one located in North Bergen. Transportation Boulevard East carries three county route designations. County Route 677 begins as Park Avenue in Hoboken, becoming Boulevard East after crossing the viaduct over the Hudson Bergen Light Rail tracks. At Highwood Terrace in Weehawken it becomes part of County Route 505. From 60th Street in West New York it is designated County Route 693 until joining its western counterpart, designated County Route 501. In total the route is slightly more than three miles long. Addresses ascend from the first at number 300.\\"300 Boulevard East\\" . Telx. Retrieved October 26, 2011. In Weehawken the numbers rise to 1055. At the border with West New York at 51st Street, the addresses jump to 5101, following the custom of taking the building number from the lower cross street. This system was jointly adopted by the North Hudson towns after streets were re-numbered after the opening of the Lincoln Tunnel in 1937.

The hamlets of Curborough and Elmhurst, that make up the parish, lie just north of the City of Lichfield, and are separated from each other by the West Coast Main Line. The parish council is a joint one with Farewell and Chorley. Curborough's name derives from Old English. The words for mill stream in Old English were 'cweorn burna,' and likely referred to Curborough brook. Geography The northern, eastern and southern boundaries of Curborough and Elmhurst run along Full, Curborough and Circuit Brooks, the western boundary runs partly along Bilson Brook, and partly along the A51. The subsoil is Keuper Marl (Mercia Mudstone) with a band of Keuper Sandstone (Bromsgrove Sandstone) along the western boundary. There are stretches of Alluvium along Full, Curborough and Bilson Brooks. The land lies at its highest in the south where Binns Farm stands at 387 ft (118m). It falls away steeply on the north to Bilson Brook. On the east it slopes down more gently to 246 ft (75m) on the northern boundary near New Farm and to 231 ft (70m) on the eastern boundary at Curborough Farm. History An early resident of Curborough was Dr. Zachary Babington, prebendary of Curborough in 1584Prebendaries of Curborough, Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1541-1857, Volume 10, Joyce M.

The Oslo Gang, also called Kompani Linge's Oslo Detachment) was a sabotage group operating in Oslo from May 1944 to May 1945, during the last year of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. The group had its basis in both the British Special Operations Executive and the Norwegian Milorg, was coordinated by Gunnar S√∏nsteby, and had around ten members. It was the dominant sabotage group in Oslo between May and September 1944, when they performed a series of successful sabotage operations. Background In May 1944 the Nazi regime announced the call up of all men born in 1921, 1922 and 1923 to \\"national labour duty\\". Earlier in 1944 a secret memorandum ( (PM)) from \\"Minister of Justice\\" Sverre Riisn√¶s, proposing to send 75,000 young Norwegians to the German-Soviet war front, had been revealed and published by the underground press. The resistance movement decided to oppose these plans by all available means. Sabotage operations against the labour duty The first sabotages were directed against Arbeidstjenesten, the registration of young people for labour duty: Destruction of a machinery for sorting registration cards, 18 May 1944 and 17 June 1944, and the demolition of the registration office at Akersgaten 55 in Oslo. Over the summer, thousands of young people left their homes, hiding in the forests, to avoid the call-up. When the Nazi authorities discovered this, they tried to prevent their food supplies by denying them ration cards. As a counter-action Oslogjengen performed a hold-up against a truck with ration cards in August 1944, securing the truck-load of cards. Other operations To paralyse the German production of explosives, an operation against two sulphur acid factories (Norsk Svovelsyrefabrikk and Lysaker kemiske Fabrik A/S) was performed in June 1944. In August 1944 an operation against a bus garage resulted in the destruction of 25 Messerschmitt fighters and 150 airplane motors. A locomotive for the Thamshavn railway, which had previously been damaged and sent to Oslo for repair, was damaged again in an operation against Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk in September 1944. Other operations were directed against Raufoss Ammunisjonsfabrikk and Kongsberg V√•penfabrikk, oil storage facilities, and a large supply of stored ball bearings. Towards the end of the war In May 1945 Oslogjengen performed an operation to secure the files in the Ministry of Justice and Police from destruction. After the war, members of the group served as guards for Crown Prince Olav when he returned from exile on 13 May 1945, and also as guards for King Haakon when he arrived in June 1945. Members Oslogjengen had about ten members, coordinated by Gunnar S√∏nsteby. Two of the group members, Gregers Gram and Edvard Tallaksen, were shot by the Germans in November 1944, and Roy Nielsen was also killed by the Germans. Other group members were Birger Rasmussen, Andreas Aubert, William Houlder, Per M√∏rland and Henrik Hop, and occasionally Max Manus. The group was eventually reinforced with the two Linge agents Arthur Pevik and Viggo Axelssen.

In 2012 the school celebrated its 125th anniversary with a ceremony and town festivities. The construction of GDHS cost $12,000, and was designed by a famous Canadian architect, Edward J. Lennox  Athletics and nickname controversy Georgetown's swimming team has consistently placed in the top 3 or won the OFSAA championships. The GDHS swim program has won 49 OFSAA titles starting in 1981. GDHS are the current OFSAA champions (2020) and have won the last twelve overall titles, setting the record for most consecutive OFSAA wins in history, in any sport. \\"Rebels\\" Until 1961, the school's nickname used in athletic competitions, was \\"the G's\\", until a schoolwide competition prompted by an improving football team resulted in a change to \\"Rebels\\"--a name inspired, according to the proponents, by rebellious notions current at the time, and a fancy for the movie Rebel Without A Cause and the song \\"Rebel-'Rouser\\". A logo was devised of a fox with an eye patch (and a \\"rebel hat\\"), symbolizing \\"the valiant underdog, the fearless fighter, the humble warrior\\"; the Confederate flag was added later, including on athletic jerseys. Only one teacher, Lyn McLaren, protested at the time, realizing the associations prompted by the nickname and the flag. One student, in a letter to a newspaper in 2004 (after McLaren's death), recollected \\"events like slave day with the yearbook showing an awkward photograph of a black student as a slave. I recall the rebel flag and the overt bigotry. I recall Jewish teachers hiding their ethnicity\\". In the wake of the 2015 Charleston church shooting, the association with racism and slavery was again questioned, though there had been earlier protests, including by an opposing wrestler of African descent in the 1980s; after 1992 the flag no longer appeared in the yearbook. By 2015, the flag had been removed, though the nickname stuck. The official process to change the nickname took place in the spring of 2017, and by the fall the nickname had been dropped. In 2019 the new nickname, \\"87s\\", was unveiled.

Originally used on the Plymouth - Cawsand ferry service. Originally she only had a single deck, with a covered cabin, but her capacity was later increased by the addition of a top deck. In 1985 The Millbrook company, by this point owned by Dart Pleasure Craft Ltd of Dartmouth, abandoned its services in Plymouth, mainly due to competition with Plymouth Boat Cruises, and the MV Plymouth Belle was transferred to the River Dart. She operated on all of the 'River Link' services of Dart Pleasure craft, including Dartmouth-Totnes, the Dartmouth-Kingswear Ferry and circular cruises from Dartmouth. In 2000 Dart Pleasure Craft took over G.H. Riddalls and Sons, their main competitor on River Dart services. With the increase in size of the fleet, the MV Plymouth Belle was surplus to requirements and laid up. In 2002 she was sold to Plymouth Boat Cruises, in exchange for the larger MV Plymouth Venturer. She began operating on Dockyard and Warship cruises from Phoenix Wharf in Plymouth. In 2005, Plymouth Boat Cruises was taken over by Sound Cruising, in a near repeat of the demise of the Millbrook company twenty years earlier.

The site now features a reconstructed 19th-century fort museum containing exhibits about the fort's history and the Aroostook War, as well as artifacts recovered from the site. In season, guided tours demonstrate the soldiers' lives during that time. History In 1839, Lt. Frederick Lenox Ingall was ordered to build a fieldwork on the Lake Temiscouata. In the summer, three barracks, one for the officers, and two for the men were erected near the Lake, at the end of the road from Riviere-du-Loup. A small detachment of the 24th Regiment of Foot arrived in the summer. The detachment consisted of only 12 men with their 6 wives and 11 children. In the following years, the original small fieldwork became a fortified fort of 12 barracks surrounded by a 12-foot stockade. Three other Regiments occupied the Fort between 1839 and 1841, the 11th, the 56th and the 68th of Foot, in order, with a maximum occupation of 200 men. In 1842, the treaty of Webster-Ashburton settled the boundary, thereby ending the war. According to local oral tradition, the Fort was demolished by the first inhabitants of Cabano in the 1900s, who used the large wood logs to build their houses. By the 1920s, nothing remained of the Fort. Bt the 1950s, the Fort was almost forgotten, relegated to a legend, until the archeological excavations of the 60s. In 1972, the Fort was reconstructed to its original dimensions, using 19th-century construction techniques. Fort Ingall is now owned by a non-profit organization, the Historical and Archeological Society of Temiscouata. See also * List of forts References * Fort Ingall brochure, undated, Parks Canada.

It is actually two separate neighborhoods, Roseville and Fleetridge, which the city lumps together for policing purposes. Roseville Roseville is the oldest settled part of Point Loma, and is named for its developer, San Diego pioneer Louis Rose.Fetzer, Leland, San Diego County Place Names A to Z, page 123 Rose bought the area in 1866, laid out streets, and built a wharf and a hotel. For a time, Roseville functioned as a separate city from San Diego. A plaque at the corner of Rosecrans Street and Avenida de Portugal (which was the intersection of First and Main streets when Roseville was an independent city) recognizes the establishment of Roseville in 1869. Many Portuguese fishermen and fishing boat owners settled in the area, and it is still the focus of San Diego's large Portuguese community. Saint Agnes Catholic Church holds services in Portuguese twice a month and hosts the annual Festa do Espirito Santo (Feast of the Holy Spirit), a religious festival which has been staged every year since 1910 and is San Diego‚Äôs oldest ethnic tradition.San Diego Union Tribune, May 31, 2009 Some people refer to the area as ‚ÄúTunaville‚Äù because of its association with the tuna-fishing fleet. The east-west streets form part of what are known as the \\"alphabetical author streets\\". This series of streets begins in Roseville and continues into the adjacent neighborhood of Loma Portal, and is named for authors in alphabetical order from Addison to Zola, with a second partial cycle from Alcott to Lytton. The north-south streets are named after trees. Roseville is served by Cabrillo Elementary School. Park and recreations facilities include Cabrillo Recreation Center and Cabrillo North and South mini parks.Peninsula Community Plan Fleetridge The hilly area above Roseville is known as Fleetridge, named for its developer David Fleet, a son of Reuben H. Fleet. It was developed between 1950 and 1955.Fetzer, Leland, San Diego County Place Names A to Z, page 123 It is characterized by curved, terrain-following streets and large custom homes.

It is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, Ocean Beach on the north, Catalina Blvd. and Santa Barbara St. on the east, and Sunset Cliffs Natural Park on the south. The area is named for the sheer cliffs which border the ocean. There are surfing spots below the cliffs. The cliffside trails are popular for walking and for watching the sunset, but are undeveloped and can be dangerous. Falls from the cliffs have resulted in deaths and injuries. The main street of the area is Sunset Cliffs Blvd. The neighborhood is almost entirely residential, with curved contour-following streets and custom homes. A small commercial strip is found along the northern end of Sunset Cliffs Blvd. running into Ocean Beach. The area contains Sunset View Elementary School, part of the San Diego City Schools, as well as a private elementary/middle school called Warren-Walker School. History American Kumeyaay Indians used to travel through Sunset Cliffs to gather seafood from the intertidal areas on the beach below the cliffs. They also gathered various forms of plant life in the area. During the 1915 Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition, Albert Spalding developed the Linear Section of the cliffs. He spent around $2 million to hire Japanese architects to construct bridges, trails, benches and a stairway into the ocean. Spalding called his estate Sunset Cliffs Park, which then lent its name to the neighborhood. In 1925, John P. Mills bought the property and surrounding area and developed it into a residential neighborhood. Mills spent approximately $1 million to restore the features created by Spalding. Later the City of San Diego acquired the Spalding property from Mills and turned the coastal strip into a city park. The creations Spalding built were affected by the weather and wave action and eventually eroded. After the features had deteriorated significantly the city deemed the area unsafe and removed all the creations Spalding constructed. Sunset Cliffs Natural Park Sunset Cliffs Natural Park is a city park adjacent to the Pacific Ocean on the western edge of Point Loma. It includes the entire strip of land immediately adjacent to the ocean, between the water and Sunset Cliffs Boulevard, as well as a larger area of undeveloped park and nature preserve on the south side of the area.Sunset Cliffs Natural Park website It was dedicated in 1983. It stretches from Adair Street to Ladera Street. This coastal strip is connected to the Point Loma Reserve. The park includes carved coastal bluffs, arches and sea caves. From the cliffs, the California gray whale can be seen migrating annually from the Bering Sea to Baja California. The park is a popular place to view the sunset, hence the name. Luscombs Point The Luscomb Point area, at the end of Hill Street, is named after Happy Luscomb, a local resident who often surfed the area. Luscomb point is a popular location for weddings and sunset viewing.

At the time of his death he was one of the few surviving New Zealand veterans of the Battle of Britain. Early life John Gordon Pattison was born 27 January 1917 in Waipawa and educated at Wanganui Collegiate School working on his father's farm. He joined the Civil Reserve of Pilots, and learned to fly at Hawke's Bay and East Coast Aero Club. With just 20 hours of flying time when the Second World War began, he volunteered for service with the RAF the day war was declared. He completed his training and sailed for the UK. Second World War Pattison arrived in Britain in late July 1940, attended 7 OTU and then joined No 266 Squadron based at Debden on 26 August 1940, flying Spitfires. On his first operation intercepting a force of enemy bombers he became separated from the squadron, ran out of fuel and made a wheels-up landing in a field. On 14 September he was posted to No 92 Squadron, based at Biggin Hill. On 23 September Pattison was attacked by a Bf 109 over Gravesend and received serious thigh wounds from a cannon shell, crash-landing at West Malling airfield. He spent eight months in hospital, but recovered and rejoined the squadron in June 1941 before becoming an instructor at 61 OTU a month later. In June 1941 Pattison contravened standing orders regarding low flying and flew under the Severn railway bridge and he lost three months seniority as a penalty. Pattison (centre) with Reg Grant (left) at RAF Westhampnett, West Sussex on 21 January 1943. In April 1942 he returned to operations with No 485 (NZ) Squadron, based at Kenley. On 26 April his Squadron was attacked by Focke-Wulf 190s, with four aircraft hit, two pilots were lost. The engine of Pattison's Spitfire was damaged, bailing out off the Sussex coast and rescued by an air-sea rescue launch. Over the next year he flew on numerous operations and was rested in June 1943. In July 1943 he was awarded a DFC for his \\"determination, zeal and courage\\". After a tour as chief flying instructor at 56 OTU, Pattison returned to operations in March 1944 with No 66 Squadron. He was involved in the Invasion of Normandy. On 6 July 6, 1944 he attacked a Messerschmitt Bf 109 near Chartres forcing the German pilot to bail out. A month later he shot down a Focke-Wulf 190 near Montrichard. Pattison was appointed to return to and command No 485 (NZ) in September and he led in support of the advancing armies through France, Belgium and Holland, claiming many enemy ground vehicles destroyed. When No 485 was withdrawn from the front line in February 1945 Pattison was posted to the staff at HQ, 84 Group. On 20 March he was awarded the DSO, the citation concluding that \\"he has set the highest standard of skill and courage and shown the finest qualities of leadership both in the air and on the ground\\". By the end of the war, in at least 259 operational sorties, he had been credited with two enemy aircraft destroyed along with an unspecified number of ground vehicles. He was shot down twice during the war.Battle of Britain pilot dies in hospital at 92 Discharged from the RAF in January 1946, Pattison returned to New Zealand to farm at Waipawa before retiring to Havelock North. Honours and awards Pattison was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1943, and made a companion of the Distinguished Service Order in 1945. He was awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur at the time of sixtieth anniversary commemorations of the Normandy landings in 2004.

It was granted in 1844 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Juan Bautista Alvarado.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The grant takes its name from Mariposa Creek, which was named for the monarch butterflies (butterfly = \\"mariposas\\" in Spanish) in the Sierra Nevada foothills. The grant was west of Yosemite, in the foothills of the western Sierra Nevada. It encompasses the present day town of Mariposa, and the former towns of Agua Fria and Ridleys Ferry on the Merced River.Dise√±o del Rancho Las Mariposas History Juan B. Alvarado, a former Mexican governor of Alta California, was awarded the grant in 1844. The ten square league grant was described as being located generally along Mariposa Creek, between the San Joaquin River, Chowchilla River, Merced River, and the Sierra Nevada. This is much bigger area than ten square leagues, and the intent was that Alvarado would select the particular ten square leagues within these boundaries - what has been called a \\"floating grant\\". Alvarado never complied with the usual requirements for a grant due to the Miwok Indians being hostile to the invasion of their longstanding homelands. John C. Fr√©mont After playing his part in the Bear Flag Revolt in 1846, John C. Fr√©mont, soldier, explorer, and (later) presidential candidate, decided to settle down in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1847 he sent $3,000 to the U.S. consul to the Territory of California, Thomas O. Larkin, to buy a ranch near Mission San Jos√©. Despite clear instructions, for some reason, Larkin purchased Rancho Las Mariposas in the southern Sierra Nevada foothills from Juan B. Alvarado. To Fr√©mont this was worthless land, over one hundred miles from the nearest settlement, had no farms or ranch lands, and was already inhabited by hostile Indians. Fr√©mont demanded the ranch near the Mission San Jose or his money back. Larkin did not act, and from 1847 to 1848 Fr√©mont was in Washington defending himself at a court- martial.Thecivilwardays.com: \\"Fr√©mont's Las Mariposas ranch\\" California Gold Rush When Fr√©mont returned to California, he learned of the 1848 gold discovery at Coloma. Shortly thereafter, Fr√©mont also discovered gold in the Mariposa region. With the California Gold Rush, Fr√©mont‚Äôs unwanted tract of land turned out to be the richest rancho in California.Dale L. Walker, 2003, Eldorado: The California Gold Rush, pp. 256‚Äì260. Forge Books, Before Fr√©mont could legally establish his grant boundaries, thousands of miners arrived on the scene. Few of the miners acknowledged Fr√©mont's claim and a legal battle began that would take until 1856 to settle and 1859 to finalize. Using the vague description of the original Alvarado grant, Fr√©mont \\"floated\\" his ten square league rancho from the original claim to cover mineral lands including properties already in the possession of miners. Rancho Las Mariposas took shape along a wide vein that stretched from Mariposa Creek to the Merced River. When the boundaries were surveyed, the grant included Mariposa, Bear Valley, and the Pine Tree and Josephine mine complex. The Pine Tree Mine was discovered in 1849, and it was consolidated with the Josephine Mine in 1859. The ore from the Pine Tree and Josephine mines was crushed at the Benton mill. Fr√©mont also owned and operated the Oso House hotel in Bear Valley. He and his wife Jessie Benton Fr√©mont made their home in Bear Valley until 1859, when they bought a house in San Francisco. Fr√©mont never worked the mines himself but preferred to lease the mines to different entities. Fr√©mont hired Palmer, Cook & Co., San Francisco bankers, to organize the Mariposa Mining Co. in 1850.Newell D. Chamberlain, 1936,The Call of Gold: True Tales on the Gold Road to Yosemite, Gazette Press, Mariposa, California Land claims With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Las Mariposas was filed with the U.S. Board of Land Commissioners in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 1 ND who confirmed Fr√©mon's title, according to the survey, which he, himself, had made. On appeal to the U. S. District Court, the decision of the Board was reversed and Fr√©mont's lawyers immediately appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 1854, the U. S. Supreme Court remanded his case back to the District Court, Fremont v. United States, U.S. Supreme Court, 58 U.S. 17 How. 542 542 (1854) declaring the claim valid and ordering an official survey, and the grant was patented to John C. Fr√©mont in 1856. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 In 1857, Fr√©mont leased the Mount Ophir section of his grant to Biddle Boggs. However, the Merced Mining Co. occupied the property and operated a gold mine. Merced Mining Co. maintained that the official survey had been made in a clandestine manner and that Fr√©mont had no title to the minerals, as his grant was for grazing and agricultural purposes only. Lengthy litigations in the face of hostile public sentiment piled up court costs and lawyer fees. In 1858, the California Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Merced Mining Co. A rehearing was granted and in 1859 the California Supreme Court reversed itself, and ruled in favor of Biddle Boggs and Fr√©mont.Biddle Boggs vs Merced Mining Co, Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the State of California, 1859, Volume 14, pp 279-380, Bancroft-Whitney Company Mining Company v. Boggs, U.S. Supreme Court, 70 U.S. 3 Wall. 304 (1865) The other claimants lost many valuable holdings. In the summer of 1858 a group of armed men seized the Pine Tree Mine, but after five days of armed confrontation with Fr√©mont‚Äôs men, they were ordered out by the governor. After the dissolution of Halleck, Peachy & Billings, Trenor W. Park worked on Fr√©mont's legal and financial problems. Mariposa Company + Frederick Law Olmsted In January 1863, Fremont, then a Major-General in the Union Army, sold Rancho Las Mariposas with its mines and infrastructure to Morris Ketchum, a New York City banker, who formed a public corporation, the Mariposa Company, and sold stock. In 1863, Frederick Law Olmsted, later the renowned American landscape architect, came from New York to Rancho Mariposa as superintendent for the Mariposa Company. Olmsted was not a mining expert. Investments were made in stamp mills, tunnels, shafts, and the other infrastructure related to the mining towns. By 1865, the Mariposa Company was bankrupt, Olmsted returned to New York, and the land and mines were sold at a sheriff's sale.

A small force of Mounted Rifles attacked a much larger force of Lipan Apaches at the base of the Diablo Mountains in Texas. Battle Setting out from Fort Inge in South Texas on October 1, 1854, Captain John G. Walker, in command of around forty men of the Mounted Rifles, headed for the Diablo Mountains region along the Rio Grande border with Mexico. Among the forty enlisted men was the future American general Eugene Asa Carr. Their mission was to investigate the reports from local settlers of stolen livestock, taken by Apache warriors. On the third day out, in the morning of October 3, 1854, Captain Walker and his men encountered well over 200 Lipan warriors near a herd of captured farm animals. Immediately Walker ordered an attack which surprised the Apaches significantly. A brief skirmish ensued and the Apaches quickly fled, leaving most of the stolen livestock. Casualties are unknown, except for Second Lieutenant Eugene Asa Carr who was wounded by an arrow and subsequently commended by General Persifor F. Smith for his \\"gallantry and coolness\\" and promoted to first lieutenant. This was the future general's first combat action.

Hillmon, 145 U.S. 285 (1892), is a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that created one of the most important rules of evidence in American and British courtrooms: an exception to the hearsay rule for statements regarding the intentions of the declarant.Mut. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Hillmon, . Decided in 1892, the Hillmon case was authored by Justice Horace Gray, and its holding has been codified in Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3), and adopted by many other jurisdictions. Background The Hillmon lawsuit concerned the enforcement of a life insurance contract and the identity of a man who died of a gunshot wound near Medicine Lodge, Kansas. Sallie Hillmon - a young woman from Lawrence, Kansas - claimed that in late 1879, her husband John had been killed by a firearm accident at a desolate Kansas campsite called Crooked Creek. The three insurance companies issuing a $25,000 policy on John Hillmon's life maintained that he was still alive. In support of their contention that Hillmon was still alive, the insurance companies offered a letter purportedly written on March 1, 1879 by Frederick Walters, a young cigarmaker. In his letter written to his sweetheart, Walters describes meeting \\"a man named Hillmon\\" who invited him to travel with him out west to start a sheep ranch. Upon the insurance companies' refusal to issue the $25,000 policy to Ms. Hillmon, she sued the companies for the policy proceeds. The first two Hillmon trials, in 1882 and 1885, produced hung juries. However, the third resulted in a victory for Sallie Hillmon. It was this 1888 verdict that led to the famous Supreme Court decision of 1892 reversing the judgment in her favor. Nevertheless, three more trials ensued, two ending with hung juries and the last in another verdict for Sallie Hillmon, which was once again overturned by the Supreme Court. The ultimate contested factual issue in all of the trials was the identity of a man whose death far predated the availability of twentieth-century methods of identification. After repeated hung juries in the first two trials, the Supreme Court found that Walters' letter should have been admitted into evidence. With this ruling, the Court created an entirely new exception to the hearsay rule for out-of-court statements describing the intentions of a declarant and remanded the decision to the trial court. More than a decade later, the trial court produced a verdict for Ms. Hillmon. On May 19, 2006 - around 115 years after the Supreme Court's ruling - Professor Marianne Wesson of the University of Colorado Law School, Anthropologist Dennis Van Gerven of the University of Colorado at Boulder, and University of Colorado graduate students in anthropology exhumed the corpse in the presence of Hillmon family members and a film crew to try to scientifically determine the corpse's identity. Although the DNA results from the bones discovered by the team were inconclusive, scientific analysis of photographic comparisons of the corpse, Hillmon, and Walters indicated that the disputed corpse was more likely Hillmon than Walters. The Hillmon case and Wesson's investigation of the identities of the corpse are described in detail in Wesson's book, A Death at Crooked Creek, and on the book's website. John Hillmon John Wesley Hillmon, a Civil War veteran, was born in 1848 in Indiana. In the late 1860s, he moved with his family to a Kansas township called Grasshopper Springs. In October 1878, Hillmon, thirty years old, married a young waitress named Sallie Quinn. Thereafter, the couple set up housekeeping in Lawrence, Kansas.MacCracken, 1968, at 51. Hillmon, an industrious man, had worked as a foreman, miner, brick maker, cowboy, ranch hand, buffalo hunter, and occasional buffalo hide dealer in Kansas, Colorado, and Texas. Despite his many occupations, he had never made much money.See the deposition of John Brown, see Transcript, No. 94, at 342-81. Accordingly, a few weeks after his wedding, Hillmon set off on a journey west with his old friend and working partner John Brown. Hillmon told Sallie that he intended to find some land where they could start a ranch of their own. Before leaving home, Hillmon purchased $25,000 of life insurance (which would be nearly $500,000 in current dollars) with the help of his wife's cousin, Levi Baldwin.Hillmon, 145 U.S. at 286. The amount of insurance was so large for a man of ordinary means to carry that Hillmon had to go to three different insurance companies to procure four policies totaling $25,000 (one for $10,000 and three for $5,000). In December 1878, Hillmon and Brown set out west for their journey. They traveled as far as the southwest Kansas town of Medicine Lodge before cold weather eventually drove them back to Wichita together, and then Hillmon back to Lawrence, Kansas. In late February 1879, Hillmon set off again, meeting up with Brown in Wichita and traveling to Crooked Creek on the night of March 16, 1879. The next evening, John Brown reported to a neighbor named Philip Briley that Hillmon had been shot dead at their campsite. The neighbor called the nearest coroner, George Paddock, who inspected the scene of the death and convened an inquest. On March 18, 1879, John Brown testified that he had accidentally shot and killed Hillmon when the rifle he was unloading from their wagon discharged, shooting Hillmon in the head. The corpse was dressed in John Hillmon's clothes and boots.MacCracken, 1968, at 52. At the inquest, witnesses from Medicine Lodge who had been in the company of Brown and Hillmon testified that the corpse was the man they had known as Hillmon. Most of them remembered Hillmon because he had passed through their town on the earlier trip.McNeal, 2009, at 91. On April 10, 1879, the Medicine Lodge inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure, or accidental death.Lawrence Standard, April 10, 1879, at 2. Once the body was buried in Medicine Lodge, Sallie requested payment of the life insurance proceeds from the three companies that had issued the policies.Hillmon, 145 U.S. at 286; MacCracken, 1968, at 52. Suspicious, the insurance companies began to investigate the Hillmon claim. At this time, life insurance fraud was not uncommon ‚Äî there had been several cases in which people had bought large amounts of insurance, killed someone, and disguised the corpse as the policy holder, who would be somewhere in hiding.MacCracken, 1968, at 51; Carleton, 1896, at 53. (In fact, when the Hillmon case reached the Supreme Court, one of the Justices would refer to the case as one of ‚Äúgraveyard insurance,‚Äù meaning fraud.)Maguire, 1925, at 711. Believing they were being swindled, the companies dispatched their agents to Medicine Lodge immediately. The agents insisted that the body be disinterred and returned to Lawrence, after which it was delivered to an undertaking establishment and inspected by dozens of persons who had known John Hillmon in life. The Douglas County coroner convened another inquest. Although performed by the state-employed Douglas County coroner, the County Attorney, and in the presence of Douglas County jurors, this inquest (which the coroner much later admitted) was wholly funded by the insurance companies, who paid all the involved parties.Topeka Daily Capital, February 16, 1895, at 6. The chief controversies at this inquest were the differences between the corpse's and Hillmon's height and teeth, in addition to the smallpox vaccination scar that the corpse carried on its shoulder.MacCracken, 1968, at 53. Sallie Quinn Hillmon and her cousin Levi Baldwin testified that the body belonged to John Hillmon, as did a few other acquaintances. Other witnesses testified emphatically that it was not and could not have been Hillmon. The corpse was five feet, eleven inches tall; some said it could not be Hillmon because Hillmon was at least two inches shorter, but others said he was exactly that height. Witnesses testified that Hillmon had one or more rotten teeth, while the corpse's teeth were excellent. But some witnesses testified that Hillmon too had fine teeth. Moreover, the corpse had a smallpox vaccination scar exactly where Hillmon had been vaccinated, but some of the insurance company doctors said that the scar on the corpse's arm was too fresh to be from the vaccination that Hillmon had received some weeks prior. Ultimately, this inquest, unlike the Medicine Lodge inquest, returned a finding that the death was of a ‚Äúperson unknown,‚Äù and had been caused ‚Äúfeloniously by J.H. Brown.‚ÄùMacCracken, 1968, at 53; Murder Will Out!, Lawrence Standard, June 26, 1879, at 4. Sallie Hillmon Sallie Hillmon, John Hillmon's wife (their marriage license can be found here), was a waitress from Lawrence, Kansas. Sallie Hillmon claimed that, in 1879, her husband John had been killed by a firearm accident at a desolate Kansas campsite called Crooked Creek. It became clear to Sallie that the insurance companies were not going to pay, so she filed suit in 1880.Hillmon, 145 U.S. at 285. Her case went to trial in 1882; it would eventually be tried six times. The Hillmon litigation lasted for almost 25 years, and would be argued in front of the Supreme Court twice. The first two trials, in 1882 and 1885, both produced hung juries. The third trial produced a verdict for Sallie Hillmon, possibly because of the trial judge's exclusion of the insurance companies‚Äô most important piece of evidence: the ‚ÄúDearest Alvina‚Äù letter.Hillmon, 145 U.S. at 287. Even with the Dearest Alvina letter in evidence, the fourth trial of 1895 and the fifth trial of 1896 ended in hung juries.MacCracken, 1968, at 76-77. In the sixth trial matters became even more interesting with the testimony of a Leavenworth cigar factory owner, Arthur Simmons.Mrs. Hillmon's Evidence to be Finished Today, Leavenworth Times, October 25, 1899, at 4. Simmons testified that he had employed an F. Walters at his cigar making shop two months after Frederick Adolph Walters‚Äô alleged death at Crooked Creek.Claims Walters Was In Leavenworth In May 1879, Leavenworth Times, November 14, 1899, at 4. He produced employment records and identified a picture of Frederick A. Walters as the Walters who was formerly in his employ.Ready for Arguments in the Hillmon Case, Leavenworth Times, November 15, 1899, at 4. This evidence was persuasive to the jury and they returned a unanimous verdict for Sallie Hillmon.MacCracken, 1968, at 77. The insurance companies managed in 1903 to persuade the Supreme Court again to overturn Sallie Hillmon's victory, on less memorable evidentiary grounds. But eventually all of the insurance companies settled with Sallie, for the full face amount of the policies plus accumulated interest. Frederick Walters The crux of the insurance company's case was a letter headed \\"Wichita, Kansas, March 1, 1879\\" and beginning \\"Dearest Alvina.\\" It appeared to be from Frederick Adolph Walters to his fianc√©e, Miss Alvina Kasten.Hillmon, 145 U.S. at 288. Walters and Kasten had been sweethearts in Fort Madison Iowa, but Walters had left his Iowa home in the spring of the previous year to pursue his trade as an itinerant cigarmaker.MacCracken, 1968, at 74; Mrs. Hillmon's Evidence to be Finished Today, Leavenworth Times, October 25, 1899, at 4. Alvina Katsen, in a pretrial deposition, swore that she had received this letter from the post office early in March 1879.Transcript, No. 184, at 1778; Was it Walters?, Leavenworth Times, June 29, 1882, at 4. In the letter, Walters wrote that he planned to leave Wichita ‚Äúwith a certain Mr. Hillmon, a sheep-trader, for Colorado or parts unknown to me.‚ÄùMaguire, 1925, at 709. It was this intention to travel with Mr. Hillmon that was crucial to the 1892 decision. According to Alivina Kasten and members of the Walters family, this was the last correspondence any of them received from Frederick, and they had not seen him since.MacCracken, 1968, at 74. Judge Oliver Perry Shiras, presiding in the third trial of the Hillmon case, had excluded this letter from the jury's knowledge, agreeing with Sallie Hillmon's lawyers that it was hearsay.MacCracken, 1968, at 75. (Her lawyers apparently had not thought to make this objection in the first two trials.) The letter certainly was hearsay according to the usual definition: an out of court statement offered in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted. There were certain recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, but the Dearest Alvina letter did not seem to qualify for any of them. The insurance companies‚Äô lawyers could do no better than to argue that it was a business record; there was such an exception to the hearsay rule, but a love letter certainly did not satisfy its requirements.MacCracken, 1968, at 75; Maguire, 1925, at 711. John Brown John Brown was John Hillmon's traveling companion. After John Brown reported the shooting death at Crooked Creek to some nearby rural residents, two inquests were conducted under the auspices of the coroner at Medicine Lodge, seat of Barbour County. The first coroner's jury failed to agree whether the death was accident or otherwise (one account says the jury ‚Äúdid not know how to render a verdict,‚Äù an odd circumstance suggesting that homicide, or at least investigations into it, were not common in Barbour County); the second concluded that the shooting was accidental. The body was then buried at Medicine Lodge, and Brown wrote a letter to Sallie Hillmon explaining what had happened and conveying his regret and condolences. In each of the inquests, Brown told the same story of an accidental shooting. However, after the Douglas County inquest's finding, Brown went to stay at his brother's home to Missouri, and soon afterward his story changed. Over the summer of 1879, Brown was approached several times by an attorney who claimed he had been hired by Brown's father to represent the son and protect him from the consequences of the second inquest verdict.That Tooth, Leavenworth Times (Kan.), June 22, 1882, at 1; Transcript, No. 184, at 401 (deposition of John Brown); A Long Story, Leavenworth Times (Kan.), June 17, 1882, at 1. But the attorney, J.R. Buchan, was really retained by the insurance companies.MacCracken, 1968, at 73; The Hillmon Case, Leavenworth Times (Kan.), June 14, 1885, at 4. It is undisputed that Brown then signed an affidavit prepared by Buchan that was wholly inconsistent with his previous tale.MacCracken, 1968, at 73. Brown's new story stated that he and Hillmon had picked up a traveler called Joe, whose last name sounded like Burgess or Berkley.Transcript, No. 184, at 400 (deposition of John Brown). This traveler, according to the affidavit, was na√Øve and agreed to travel unseen, hiding at times under the blanket in the wagon so people would only note two men traveling together. The document went on to say that ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù was chosen because he was a passable lookalike for Hillmon, and that Hillmon had inoculated the intended victim by using a pocket knife and serum from Hillmon's own vaccination site. Brown's affidavit stated that it was Hillmon who murdered the Joe Burgess/Berkley and switched clothes with the victim, as well as planting his own journal in the victim's inside jacket pocket. The affidavit also described a conversation Brown had with Sallie, in which she said she knew of Hillmon's whereabouts and that he was not dead.Transcript, No. 184, at 416 (deposition of John Brown). After Buchan showed this affidavit to Mrs. Hillmon, in an unsuccessful effort to persuade her to withdraw her insurance claims, Brown tore up it up and threw it in the stove.Transcript, No. 184, at 457 (deposition of John Brown); How It Happened, Leavenworth Times (Kan.), June 20, 1882, at 1. (Buchan retrieved it and repaired it for use in court later, making clear that his real client was the insurance companies.MacCracken, 1968, at 73; The Hillmon Case, Topeka Daily Capital (Kan.), March 2, 1888, at 4.) Later, Brown further repudiated this statement, and he testified in 1882 that he had only signed the affidavit because Buchan had told him he would be arrested and convicted of murder if he refused.Transcript, No. 184, at 401 (deposition of John Brown); MacCracken, 1968, at 74.  The Supreme Court Opinion  After losing the third trial to Sallie Hillmon, the companies pursued an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.MacCracken, 1968, at 75; Maguire, 1925, at 709. That Court overturned the jury's verdict for Sallie, ruling that declarations of intention are ‚Äòcredible evidence‚Äô of said intention, and that such statements of intention are thus admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule.Maguire, 1925, at 710. The Court held that often such evidence is \\"indispensable to the due administration of justice\\" and the truth of such evidence is an evidentiary issue to be decided by the jury.Hillmon, 145 U.S. at 296. This decision was quite novel, for there was very little authority for the proposition that statements of intention qualified as an exception to the hearsay rule.MacCracken, 1968, at 75-76. Most hearsay exceptions (then and now) rest on the belief that certain kinds of statements are unlikely to be false even if made without benefit of oath and cross-examination.Hillmon, 145 U.S. at 299. It was Walters‚Äô expressed intention to go traveling with Hillmon that was dispositive of the Court's 1892 opinion.Hillmon, 145 U.S. at 295. The Court held that the declarations in the letters tended to prove Walters‚Äô ‚Äúintention of going, and going with Hillmon,‚Äù which would make it more plausible that Walters‚Äô ‚Äúdid go and that he went with Hillmon,‚Äù which in turn would increase the likelihood that the corpse and murder victim was Walters. The Court concluded that admissibility of Frederick Adolph Walters‚Äô letters could contribute to the circumstantial case presented by the defendants and ‚Äúmight properly influence the jury.‚Äù  Modern Investigation  In March 2006, with the help of attorney Mark Thornhill from the Kansas City, Missouri law firm of Spencer, Fane, Britt and Browne, Professors Wesson and Dennis Van Gerven obtained permission from a judge in Lawrence, Kansas to disinter the disputed remains, which were buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in that city. In May 2006, accompanied by a film crew, anthropology graduate students, and a few of Hillmon's descendants, they excavated the grave, with the goal of using modern forensics to identify the body. A backhoe was used to remove the first couple of feet of soil, then shovels for the next few feet, and lastly hands and hand tools when it was decided that the potentially fragile remains might be too close to continue the use of larger tools. Once the diggers got down deep enough, an underground stream was discovered; it had been flowing through the body and the casket for an indeterminate amount of time. In fact there was not much casket left from the years of spring water flowing through the grave; only a few rusty coffin nails remained of the container. After hours of careful digging, Van Gerven found 47 bone fragments and 5 teeth, fragmented and eroded from long immersion in the wet ground. Because the frail nature of the remains made physical methods of identification impossible, Wesson and Van Gerven planned to use DNA matching to determine if the bones belonged to John Hillmon (Wesson had managed to track down John Hillmon's half-brother's grandson, Leray Hillmon, and procure a DNA sample). However, the bones did not contain sufficient human DNA to enable testing given that the water and organisms engulfed any human genetic material that might have resided in the remains. Nevertheless, Van Gerven and his colleagues were able to analyze the photographic evidence available: pictures of the living men John Hillmon and Frederick Adolph Walters, and photographs taken of the corpse during the Lawrence inquest. They used photographical superimposition, which is generally used for exclusion but can be used for positive identification of unique morphological features. Van Gerven used the profile shot of the corpse in the coffin and superimposed it onto pictures of John Hillmon and Frederick A. Walters. ‚ÄúThe profile image of the corpse was then digitally rotated into a vertical axis matching the life photographs,‚Äù Van Gerven explained in his report. The pictures were then matched using standard anatomical points (the lower margin of the chin and a point at the top of the nasal bones between the eyes) in order to establish scale. The results showed a striking similarity between the corpse and Hillmon's photograph in their nasal profiles, hairlines, eyebrow positions, and lips. With these results, Van Gerven concluded that the corpse more closely matched John Hillmon than Frederick Walters. For more information on the exhumation, see here.  Documentary Film  A movie named Hillmon‚Äôs Bones was made to document the exhumation and resulting forensic determinations. Directed by Professor Ernesto Acevedo-Munoz of the University of Colorado, the film also tells the Hillmon story through interviews with Professors Wesson and Van Gerven, and the other participants in the research.  Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3)  Hillmon has been codified by Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3), has found its way into the evidence rules of all or nearly all American states, and has been adopted in international jurisdictions including England and Australia.Maguire, 1925, at 720. FRE 803(3) makes hearsay admissible if it is \\"a statement of the declarant‚Äôs then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\\"Fed. R. Evid. 803(3). The advisory committee comments make clear that the Hillmon is the source of the exception.Fed. R. Evid. 803(3) advisory committee's note (\\"[T]he rule of [Hillmon] . . . allowing evidence of intention as tending to prove the doing of the act intended is, of course, left undisturbed.\\") The Hillmon exception has played a role in several notable cases, including United States v. Pheaster, 544 F.2d 353 (1976). In that case, Angelo Inciso was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to seventy years in prison, largely on the victim's testimony that he was ‚Äúgoing to meet Angelo.‚ÄùUnited States v. Pheaster, 544 F.2d 353, 375 (1976). Although some of the appellate judges in that case doubted the fairness of this outcome, they ultimately agreed that the outcome was compelled by the Hillmon doctrine. Professor Wesson has criticized Hillmon as an outcome-oriented decision and argued for its repeal. For a critical analysis of the court's decision, see here.

The 60th Tennessee was organized October 1, 1862; mustered into Confederate service November 7, 1862; captured at Vicksburg; served remainder of war in Vaughn's Brigade in East Tennessee and Western Virginia. Organization This regiment was first known as the 79th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, but was officially designated the 60th Tennessee Infantry Regiment by the Adjutant and Inspector General's Office. It was organized into a regiment at Haynesville (present-day Johnson City, Tennessee), from 11 companies which had been enrolled in August, and September. When mustered into Confederate service, the mustering authorities would only accept 10 companies for the regiment, and Company \\"L\\" apparently disbanded, as no further record of it has been found. Immediately after organization the regiment was assigned to the brigade of Brigadier General John C. Vaughn along with the 61st and 62nd Tennessee Regiments. These regiments remained together in Vaughn's Brigade throughout the war. The brigade was ordered to the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana and arrived at Jackson, Mississippi late in November, 1862. Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton reported: \\"On December 21, 1862, while at Grenada, Mississippi, information was received that a large fleet of gunboats and transports was moving down the Mississippi for the supposed purpose of attacking Vicksburg. Brigadier General J. C. Vaughn's Brigade of East Tennessee was at once ordered to that point.\\" Vicksburg The brigade arrived December 26, and there participated in the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou and Chickasaw Bluffs. General Stephen D. Lee's Brigade formed the right of the line of defense, General Seth M. Barton's the center, and General Vaughn's the left. General Vaughn reported that on the second day he sent the 62nd to re-enforce Lee; the 60th to re-enforce Barton on the 3rd day; leaving one regiment, the 61st to defend the abattis. Pemberton's report stated; \\"on the left, commanded by Brigadier General Vaughn, the heavy abattis prevented the approach of the enemy except with sharpshooters who advanced continuously, but were met firmly by his East Tennesseans.\\" An inspection report by Bob E. Houston, Captain and Assistant Inspector General, for January‚ÄìFebruary, 1863 on Company \\"G\\". stated: I take pleasure in stating that in discipline, efficiency and military appearance this company exceeds that of any I have ever seen in Volunteer service.\\" The brigade remained at Vicksburg until about the first of May, when General Pemberton decided to meet the enemy in the field. Toward the end of this campaign, on May 17, while guarding a bridge over the Big Black River, Vaughn's Brigade was overwhelmed by a Federal division at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge. The 60th regiment surrendered to Brigadier General Stephen G. Burbridge's 1st Brigade, 10th Division. A regimental report stated: \\"Lieutenant Colonel Gregg, one captain, three 1st lieutenants, seven 2nd lieutenants, six brevet 2nd lieutenants, captured at Big Black, Mississippi on May 17, 1863, and have not been exchanged. Enlisted men captured at Big Black: 239. They belonged to Companies \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", \\"E\\" \\"F\\", \\"H\\" and \\"I\\". This report was dated October, 1864. The Federal reports of this action stated that the regiment, with 360 stand of arms, was captured without the loss of a man by the Federal troops. What was left of the regiment fell back into Vicksburg, and remained in the trenches until the surrender on July 4, 1863. The brigade was surrendered as part of Major General Morgan Lewis Smith's Division, and paroled a few days after the surrender. On July 16, Vaughn's Brigade was reported at Brandon, Mississippi. On September 15, Inspector General Cooper stated \\"Vaughn's Brigade was ordered to reassemble in East Tennessee, at such place as General Simon Buckner might designate. But if the men have been seized by the enemy, and their paroles taken from them, it will prevent their reorganization.\\" Parole Colonel J. G. Rose, of the 61st Regiment, in his outline in Lindsley's Annals of his own regiment, stated the men from the 61st who were paroled at Vicksburg were not exchanged until June 27, 1864, and the men captured at Big Black remained in Northern prisons until the winter of 1864-5. He further stated that in the spring of 1864 many of these paroled prisoners were assembled in parole camps at Jonesborough, Tennessee, awaiting exchange. The 60th was not paroled until July 1, 1864, its members remaining at their homes during their paroles.Hale, page 1469. After exchange, they became mounted infantry. A detachment from the 60th, 61st and 62nd regiments was reported near Jonesborough, September 13, 1864. In the meantime, General Vaughn had been given command of Colonel A. W. Reynolds' Brigade, composed of the 3rd Confederate, 39th, 43rd and 59th Tennessee Infantry Regiments. These regiments were mounted about the last of 1863, and served as Mounted Infantry from then on. On December 31, 1863, a detachment from the 2nd Fast Tennessee Brigade, under Major James A. Rhea, of the 60th, was reported as a part of this brigade. On March 31, 1864, the detachment was listed as from the 60th, 61st and 62nd Regiments, and was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William Parker of the 62nd. An inspection report dated May 6, 1864, showed this detachment consisted of only 48 men present. On April 20, 1864, a detachment from the 16th Georgia Battalion, 3rd, 39th, 43rd, 60th, 61st and 62nd Tennessee Regiments, under Captain Nathan Dodd of the 61st was reported in General Bushrod Johnson's Brigade, General Simon Buckner's Division, at Zollicoffer (now Bluff City), Tennessee. Vaughn's Brigade It was not until November 10, 1864, that the 60th, 61st and 62nd Regiments were reported as regiments in Vaughn's Brigade. At that time the 60th was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Gregg, and the brigade was made up of the 16th Georgia Cavalry Battalion, 1st (Carter's), 3rd, 39th, 43rd, 59th, 60th, 61st and 62nd Tennessee Mounted Regiments, 12th (Day's) and 16th (Neal's) Cavalry Battalions. The brigade reported 993 effectives, 1358 present, 796 prisoners of war. It was in the Department of Western Virginia and East Tennessee, commanded by Major General John C. Breckinridge. The 60th was reported stationed near Davenault's Ford. This was the last regimental or company report found on the 60th. On February 28, 1865, the order of battle for Brigadier General John Echols' Command showed the 60th, now commanded by Colonel Gregg, still in Vaughn's Brigade, with Abbott's Scouts having been added to the brigade, and the 13th Georgia Regiment reported instead of the 16th Georgia Battalion. General Echols was still in command of the Department when news of General Lee's surrender was received, and he dissolved his command in Western Virginia. Some of General Vaughn's Brigade crossed into North Carolina and served as part of President Jefferson Davis' escort from Charlotte, North Carolina to Washington, Georgia, but it is not known whether or not any of the 60th were in this force.

A single-engined pusher biplane, the Bat Boat was the first successful flying boat and amphibious aircraft built in the United Kingdom, with examples used by the Royal Navy and by Greece and Germany. Development and design In summer 1912, the British pioneer aviator Thomas Sopwith, also a keen yachtman and power-boat racer, started design of a flying boat, to be called the \\"Bat Boat\\" after a flying machine in Rudyard Kipling's short story With the Night Mail, to combine his interests in aviation and the sea.Bruce, Aeroplane Monthly, August 1991, pp. 485‚Äì486.Robertson 1970, p. 31. The resultant design was a biplane, powered by a Gnome rotary engine in a tractor configuration. The hull, which was made of Consuta, i. (plywood sheeting sewn in place with copper wire) was built by S. E. Saunders, the shipbuilders based at Cowes on the Isle of Wight who were experienced in the construction of power-boats, while the wings, of about 30 ft (9.15 m) span, were built at Sopwith's flying school at Brooklands. Although the aircraft was approaching completion by August 1912, it was abandoned and was never flown.Bruce, Aeroplane Monthly, August 1991, pp. 486‚Äì487.London 2003, p. 3. Sopwith then produced a completely new design of flying boat, still called \\"Bat-boat\\", this time a pusher configuration two-bay biplane powered by a 90 hp (67 kW) Austro- Daimler engine. The hull, which was again built by Saunders of Consuta, accommodated two people side-by-side in an open cockpit in line with the leading edge of the wings, and had a curved, vee-profile planing bottom. The wings, of 41 ft (12.5 m) span, were unstaggered, with lateral control by wing warping. The tail, which had no fixed fin, was carried on tailbooms connected to the wings, while an additional forward elevator was fitted to the front of the hull to supplement the normal elevator fitted to the tail.Bruce, Aeroplane Monthly, August 1991, p. 487. The new Bat-boat was assembled at Sopwith's new factory at Kingston upon Thames early in 1913, and was displayed at the International Aero Show at Olympia, London in February that year.Mason, Air Enthusiast, 1982, p. 75. The Bat-Boat was sent from Olympia to Cowes for tests in March, with both Thomas Sopwith and Harry Hawker attempting, with little success, to get the Bat Boat airborne. The Bat Boat was wrecked by a storm.Bruce, Aeroplane Monthly, August 1991, p. 500.Robertson 1970, p. 33. A second Bat Boat soon followed, omitting the forward elevator, while a third aircraft was built using components of the first prototype, but with a 100 hp (75 kW) Green engine and an amphibious undercarriage. Thus equipped, the third Bat Boat won the ¬£500 Mortimer Singer prize for the first all-British amphibious aircraft on 8 July 1913.London 2003, p. 5.Flight, 12 July 1913, p. 762. In 1914, Sopwith laid down a second pair of Bat Boats. These two aircraft had a similar layout to the first three aircraft, but were larger, having a span of 55 ft (16.76 m), and were powered by 200 hp Salmson engines. The first of these pair was displayed at the Olympia Air Show in March 1914.London 2003, p. 9.Flight, 21 March 1914, pp. 306‚Äì307. Also in March, Sopwith commenced building a final Bat Boat to compete in the 1914 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain race for seaplanes.Flight, 31 July 1914, p. 800. This was similar to the Salmson powered Bat Boat exhibited at Olympia, but was powered by a 225 hp (168 kW) Sunbeam engine. However, the outbreak of the First World War led to cancellation of the Circuit of Britain race.Flight, 21 August 1914, pp. 873‚Äì875. Operational history The second Bat-Boat was purchased by the Admiralty and delivered to Calshot Naval Air Station in June 1913, being allocated the serial number 38. It was badly damaged, however, sinking at its moorings on 23 August 1913,Flight, 30 August 1913, p. 967. having to be rebuilt again by Sopwith's. After serving at several Naval Air Stations, it was destroyed in a gale at Scapa Flow, Orkney, on 21 November 1914. The third Bat Boat was also purchased by the RNAS in February 1914, and given the serial number 118. It was used for a night flying demonstration at the Fleet Review in July 1914, and for bomb dropping trials at Calshot, being scrapped in February 1915 when it was found that its hull was badly rotted.London 2003, p. 4. The first of the two Salmson powered Bat Boats was purchased by the German Navy Air Service, being used as a trainer at Kiel. The second Salmson powered Bat Boat was, after testing at Calshot of radio equipment, sold to Greece in July. The Circuit of Britain machine was subject to compulsory purchase by the RNAS following the outbreak of war. While it suffered engine problems, it remained in use until April 1915.

It previously operated as a hotel and casino from 1978 to 2005, under various names, including Sahara Reno, Reno Hilton, Flamingo Hilton Reno, Flamingo Reno, and Golden Phoenix Reno. The building was converted into a condominium tower from 2006 to 2008. It was formerly connected to Fitzgeralds Reno by a sky bridge. It is owned and operated by ST Residential LLC. History Sahara Reno (1978‚Äì81) The Primadonna in May 1973 The main hotel/casino, on North Sierra Street, was originally opened in 1978 as Sahara Reno. It was owned by the Del E. Webb Corporation, which also owned the Sahara resort in Las Vegas. The Sahara Reno was designed by David Jacobson Associates and constructed by the Del E. Webb Corporation. A separate casino building, located on Virginia Street, had previously operated from 1955 until 1978 as the Primadonna, before becoming part of the Sahara. The Virginia Street building was later reopened as Siri's Casino in 2014. Hilton/Flamingo (1981‚Äì2001) Reno Hilton logo In 1981, the Sahara Reno became the Reno Hilton, then was renovated in 1992 and became the Flamingo Hilton Reno. Flamingo Reno logo In 2000, Hilton declined to renew its licensing agreement with the Flamingo brand, and the Flamingo Hilton Reno became simply the Flamingo Reno, returning to the original brand formed in the 1940s in Las Vegas. The 602 room hotel-casino made a profit until its corporate owner Park Place Entertainment, owned by a subsidiary of Hilton Hotels, decided the resort was no longer profitable in a declining gaming market. They decided to close the property on October 21, 2001. The property was sold soon after closing to Vista Hospitality LLC of New York who pledged to renovate and reopen the hotel-casino. Golden Phoenix Reno (2002‚Äì05) Former Golden Phoenix Reno The new name--Golden Phoenix Reno--was announced in early 2002. The property's hotel reopened on April 2, 2002. It included 604 rooms, a Benihana steakhouse, a coffee shop, and a nightclub. The property's casino area opened in summer 2003, with an official grand opening. Prior to the casino's grand opening, the movie The Cooler was filmed at the Golden Phoenix. Chicago real estate developer Fernando Leal put a bid in to buy the hotel- casino. Leal won his bid, and announced plans to convert the hotel-casino property into \\"The Montage\\" following a $170 million investment that would take the hotel property down to its concrete support columns, and rebuild condominiums based on the original platform. Leal closed the Golden Phoenix on December 6, 2005 and his crews began gutting the hotel building in spring 2006. The Montage Reno (2008‚Äìpresent) Building during condo conversion, July 2006 The Montage Reno was completed in April 2008. Originally, Leal envisioned The Montage Reno as a flourishing condominium resort with a signed lease for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and the other retail pad planned for the high-profile Cafe Med. Both would fall out. And as a result, Leal would hand the completed project back to its lender to avert a foreclosure disaster in December 2008. The Montage is now owned by Chicago-based ST Residential, a subsidiary of Starwood Assets and Holdings, a global company.

The company agrees to provide financial and other support for the artist, including direct advances as well as support in marketing, promotion, touring and other areas. In turn, the artist agrees to give the company a percentage of an increased number of their revenue streams, often including digital and online sales, live performance, merchandise, endorsement deals and songwriting royalties.Neo, Jesse. \\"Music 101: 360 Record Deal Explained (2020 UPDATED)\\", Retrieved on 2 August 2020. This business arrangement is an alternative to the traditional recording contract. In a 360 deal, a company typically provides support to an artist in more areas than covered by a traditional recording contract on the condition of receiving a percentage of revenue from these additional areas. During the first decade of the 21st century, revenues from recorded music fell dramatically and the profit margins traditionally associated with the record industry disappeared. The 360 deal reflects the fact that much of a musician's income now comes from sources other than recorded music, such as live performance and merchandise. History According to Jeff Hanson, head of Silent Majority Group, the first new artist 360¬∞ deal was created by Hanson along with attorneys Jim Zumwalt and Kent Marcus, and Jim's partner Orville. It was submitted to Atlantic Records for the rock band Paramore while Hanson, Marcus and Zumwalt were employed by the label. Hanson has said there was strong resistance to the deal by both label and band and that he had to fight to make it happen, but believes his efforts were vindicated by the band's subsequent success, saying: \\"How else would a label have been patient enough to put the band on three straight Warped Tours and down-streamed the band to Fueled by Ramen all while losing millions of dollars?\\" 360 deals have been made by traditional record companies, as in Robbie Williams's pioneering deal with EMI in 2002. They have also been made between artists and promoters, as with Live Nation's 2007 deal with Madonna and 2008 deal with Jay-Z. Criticism 360¬∞ deals have attracted criticism from various quarters. Panos Panay, CEO of online music platform Sonicbids, has said: > \\"If you want to find out the future of 360¬∞ deals, look at Motown in the > late 60s. Motown was the pioneer of a 360¬∞ deal ... They owned your > likeness, your touring, publishing, record royalties, told you what to wear, > told you how to walk ‚Ä¶ It made for great entertainment but if you look at > every one of those artists, what happened? Sooner or later they said, 'I‚Äôm > not going to go on the road for 200 shows because you tell me so. I‚Äôm an > artist! I‚Äôm a creative person!' Eventually all these artists left ... > There‚Äôs two things we know about creativity: you can‚Äôt force it and you > can‚Äôt really control it.\\" Mac DeMarco, an independent musician, criticized 360 deals for taking profits, saying: > \\"Do not sign a 360 deal. I don‚Äôt care how much money they‚Äôre offering you, > don‚Äôt [take it]. It‚Äôs an awful, awful idea. It‚Äôs a long time, a really long > time. And they own your image.

They formed in February 2004 as a surf-rock inspired project after post-graduate work at the University of Otago. The band has independently recorded and released six albums; In Sea (2006), Quiet Earth (2009), Balance Escapes (2010), Upsidedownbackwards (2012), Ceiling in the Sky (2015), and Antarctica (2018). Within a week of its release, Upsidedownbackwards debuted on the New Zealand Artists Albums Chart and quickly climbed to number 7 over five weeks. With their fifth album Ceiling in the Sky, the band made their Official New Zealand Top 40 debut, peaking at number 15 and number 3 on the NZ Album Charts. Over the course of the band's career they have toured extensively across New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, and received many accolades in their native New Zealand and abroad, including securing a finalist position in the 2013 International Songwriting Competition in the AAA category plus a nomination in the Hollywood Music in Media Awards.  History   Formation  Singer-songwriter Julian Temple was born into a diverse family of working musicians, with his mother, a Dixieland jazz pianist, and his father a classical lute player, giving him his first musical inspirations. Earliest memories include playing with toys and singing under his mother's antique grand piano as she vamped away to her original sheet music by the likes of Scott Joplin, Irving Berlin, Jelly Roll Morton, Rudy Vallee, Al Jolson and all the ragtime greats. The youngest of three, Temple taught himself the guitar at the age of 12 and immediately started writing his own material. Fast forward to 2001 and Temple's family relocated to the small city of Dunedin in the South Island of New Zealand, Temple's father enrolled him in the undergraduate music program at the historic University of Otago. Dunedin, New Zealand is known as a hub for small indie bands that gain large International followings (sometimes these acts are referred to under the sobriquet the Dunedin sound), such as: The Clean, The Verlaines, The Chills, and Chris Knox among others. It was here that Temple met fellow students, and soon to be band members Paul Mclennan-Kissel (known as PMK) and Matthew Brook and began jamming on new songs with the musicians. The group began playing shows around Dunedin, New Zealand with various acts, including reggae-rock act Left or Right, and then emergent dub band Six60. After the release of In Sea (2006), recorded at Albany Street Studios in Dunedin, the band garnered critical praise, NZ Musician writing: \\"The album is likely an accurate representation of their live sound, there are no complications, no layers of recorded guitars, just the band doing their thing\\". The album established the band's signature blend of genres and dynamics: \\"The music is sparse and simple with interesting interplay between the solid grooves of the bass, tidy playing on acoustic guitar and snappy drumming. This, with the breathy and poetic but not cheesy lyrics, push them into an acoustic rock, slightly jazzy, slightly bluesy kind of area\\".  Quiet Earth (2009)  Before an extensive tour of New Zealand in 2009, the band released their sophomore effort Quiet Earth (2009). Featuring fan-favourites Speedy, and Run Like Water, the touring of the album began to establish the band as a solid live act, with Temple himself being described as \\"Quite the showman with a rambunctious live show\\". Some reviews, while critical of some aspects of the album, praised the songwriting of the trio: \\"...because there's a lot of other good stuff going on: they are tight trio; Temple plays some superb guitar solos, fills and vamps; and he writes some strong songs\\".  Balance Escapes (2010)  After a lengthy tour, the band entered Paul Mclennan-Kissel's private studio named Sub Urb Studios, and quickly recorded a follow-up to 2009's Quiet Earth ‚Äì the rock- inspired album Balance Escapes (2010). The record was the only full-length album to feature new bassist Scott Campbell, who had come to the attention of drummer McLennan-Kissel through their interactions in a jazz trio they both performed in called Entropy Trio. Campbell quickly took to touring with the band, even performing some of the dates on the Quiet Earth (2009) tour. The album featured a more rock-oriented sound, with some ambient features. Hit- song Debt Collector featured this new sound, while romping Black Holes For Eyes quickly became a live staple for the band.  Nowhere Fast (2011)  Having toured and recorded three records with the band, Julian returned to his native California on hiatus to work on new material, and later that year began work on a post-graduate diploma in Songwriting at the University of Otago. Nowhere Fast (2011), a solo effort, was released as part of this scholarship. The demo album featured B-sides from years with the band, and new material of a more introspective acoustic nature. The solo album of Temple featured stripped down version of songs that would later be performed by the Julian Temple Band, including Be Okay (\\"Darkest Day\\"), and title track Nowhere Fast (\\"Upsidedownbackwards\\"). Julian began to become fascinated with the songwriting styles of Country music at this time, particularly the songs of Townes Van Zandt. The influence of this music on Julian's solo effort, and subsequent Julian Temple Band writing became apparent in follow-up albums.  Upsidedownbackwards (2013)  After bassist Scott Campbell moved to the capital of New Zealand, Wellington, to work in a museum, the now two-piece of Temple and Mclennan-Kissel recruited symphonic-orchestral musician Alex Vaatstra to play violin. After playing some notable gigs around the South Island, the group then rounded out the four-piece band with the addition of bassist Paul McMillan, a local Dunedin musician that had played for Males, and pop-band Two Cartoons. The band set about recording the next album in the artist-space known as The Attic, where drummer McLennan-Kissel was renting a space at the time. Over a week the new album was tracked, with overdubs being recorded at Mclennan-Kissel's house in Dunedin. The process was intensive, with the then relatively new bandmates recording well in to the next morning during some sessions. The result, Upsidedownbackwards, was the most successful Julian Temple Band record to date. Within a week of its release, Upsidedownbackwards debuted on the Official New Zealand Artists Albums Chart and quickly climbed to number 7 over five weeks.  Ceiling in the Sky (2015)  In 2014 the band returned for the first time in 8 years to Albany Street Studios, to record the follow-up album to their most successful record Upsidedownbackwards (2013). The highly anticipated record, titled Ceiling in the Sky, was produced by the band's bass player, Paul McMillan. Prolific recording engineer and Dunedin musician Michael Holland recorded and mixed the album, having worked with many of the band's contemporaries, including Left or Right. Legendary producer and sound engineer Tex Houston was enlisted to master the record, after Temple asked him to help with the record having heard his seminal work with bands The Clean, the 3ds, and David Kilgour. Producer and bassist Paul McMillan suggested ahead of its release that the band might move into electric and acoustic territory on the album: \\"It's definitely the most instruments we've ever had on anything. It's adding on the last record and building on the band that we have, which is nice\\". The album was released internationally on 17 October 2015. The album debuted on the Official New Zealand Top 40 Albums Charts at number 18, a week later re-entering at a new peak of number 15. It reached number 3 on the Official NZ Album Charts.  Antarctica (2018)  2018 saw the JTB return to the studio as a brand new six-piece, enlisting the talents of keyboardist Logan Hampton (Alizarin Lizard), bassist Steve 'Seedy' Marshall (Left Or Right), and electric guitarist Richard Ley-Hamilton (Males, Asta Rangu). Antarctica was recorded at Chick's Hotel, a historic building, in Port Chalmers, Dunedin, New Zealand by local studio engineer Tom Bell of Port Chalmers Recording Services.

He also taught at the Milan Conservatory and spent 15 years performing in St Petersburg from 1852 to 1867. Cavallini played on a six-key boxwood clarinet, which was considered an \\"outdated\\" instrument. Cavallini was described as the \\"Paganini of the clarinet\\". His playing inspired Verdi to compose a clarinet solo and cadenza in his 1862 La forza del destino, and led Panizza to include a set of variations for clarinet in his The Challenge of Barletta. As a composer, he is best known for Adagio and Tarantella, Adagio Sentimental, his fantasies, and his 30 Caprices for Clarinet. Cavallini also composed several works for E‚ô≠ clarinet, including the Carnival of Venice variations, I figli di Eduardo 4th in partnership with Panizza, and Fantasia on a Theme from Ultimo Giorno di Pompeii. He cited Rossini as an influence in his compositions, and composed Una Lagrima sulla Tomba dell'Immortale Rossini in his honour. His compositions were often performed by fellow clarinetist Ferdinando Busoni, but he performed one of his fantasias for the Philharmonic Society in London on 2 May 1842 and again 23 June 1845.

Under her leadership, the Committee grew in stature as it became a prominent voice for tackling rising national debt that is projected to reach record levels as a share of the economy in the years to come.

She lived and worked as a photographer in Berlin, Germany between 2004 and 2016 and is currently based in Okinawa, Japan. Noguchi focuses on photography of nature, with landscape sceneries and animals. Her frequent use of close-ups and blurred images create an aura of impressionism.

First used by the Chinese, chopsticks later spread to other East Asian cultural sphere countries including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and South and Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Thailand. Chopsticks are an eating utensil consisting of two sticks, made of wood, metal, ceramics or some other material, most commonly used by and associated with East Asian cultures (China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam) and more recently Hawaii, and the West Coast of North America, and cities with Overseas Asian communities all around the globe. Chopsticks are smoothed and frequently tapered and are commonly made of bamboo, plastic, wood, or stainless steel. They are less commonly made from titanium, gold, silver, porcelain, jade, or ivory. Chopsticks are held in the dominant hand, between the thumb and fingers, and used to pick up small pieces of food. Terminology Chopsticks in use The English word \\"chopstick\\" may have derived from Chinese Pidgin English, in which \\"chop chop\\" meant \\"quickly\\".Norman, Jerry (1988) Chinese, Cambridge University Press, p267. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest published use of the word is in the 1699 book Voyages and Descriptions by William Dampier: \\"they are called by the English seamen Chopsticks\\".Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition 1989 Another possibility, is that the term is derived from chow (chow chow) which is also a pidgin word stemming from Southeast Asia meaning food, thus chopsticks would simply mean 'food sticks'. The Standard Chinese term for chopsticks is ku√†izi (). The first character (Á≠∑) is a semantic-phonetic compound with a phonetic part meaning \\"quick\\" (Âø´), and a semantic part meaning \\"bamboo\\" (Á´π). In ancient written Chinese, the character for chopsticks was zhu (ÁÆ∏; Middle Chinese reconstruction: dÃ™jwo-). Although it may have been widely used in ancient spoken Chinese, its use was eventually replaced by the pronunciation for the character ku√†i (Âø´), meaning \\"quick\\". The original character, though still used in writing, is rarely used in modern spoken Chinese. It, however, is preserved in Chinese dialects such as Hokkien and Teochew as the Min Chinese languages are directly descended from Old Chinese rather than Middle Chinese. For written semantic differentiation between the \\"fast\\" (Âø´) versus \\"chopsticks\\", a new character was created for \\"chopsticks\\" (Á≠∑) by adding the \\"bamboo\\" (Á´π) radical (‚∫Æ) to it.Norman, Jerry (1988) Chinese, Cambridge University Press, p76.

The earliest known textual reference to the use of chopsticks comes from the Han Feizi, a philosophical text written by Han Fei (c. 280‚Äì233 BCE) in the 3rd century BCE.Needham, Joseph. (2000). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 6, Biology and Biological Technology, Part 5, Fermentations and Food Science. Cambridge University Press. p. 104. footnote 161. The first chopsticks were used for cooking, stirring the fire, serving or seizing bits of food, and not as eating utensils. Chopsticks began to be used as eating utensils during the Han dynasty. Chopsticks were considered more lacquerware-friendly than other sharp eating utensils. It was not until the Ming dynasty that chopsticks came into normal use for both serving and eating. They then acquired the name kuaizi and the present shape.Endymion Wilkinson, Chinese History: A Manual (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, Rev. and enl., 2000), 647 citing Yun Liu, Renxiang Wang, Qin Mu, Êú®Ëäπ.

File:Song Dynasty silver chopsticks, cup, and spoon.JPG|Silver chopsticks, spoon, and bowl from the Song dynasty File:Kuniyoshi Utagawa, Women 22.jpg|A painting of a Japanese woman using chopsticks, by Utagawa Kuniyoshi The earliest European reference to chopsticks comes in the Portuguese Suma Oriental by Tom√© Pires, who wrote in 1515 in Malacca: Use Hashi (for eating) and saibashi (for cooking, shown below) Westerners using chopsticks in a tourist restaurant in China, 1987 To use chopsticks, the lower chopstick is stationary, and rests at the base of the thumb, and between the ring finger and middle finger. The second chopstick is held like a pencil, using the tips of the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, and it is moved while eating, to pull food into the grasp of the chopsticks. Chopsticks, when not in use, are placed either to the right or below one's plate in a Chinese table setting. Some Chinese people feel that using serving chopsticks is more sanitary. For cooking Saibashi (ËèúÁÆ∏; „Åï„ÅÑ„Å∞„Åó) are Japanese kitchen chopsticks used in Japanese cuisine. They are used in the preparation of Japanese food, and are not designed for eating. These chopsticks allow handling of hot food with one hand, and are used like regular chopsticks. These chopsticks have a length of or more, and may be looped together with a string at the top. They are made from bamboo, but for deep frying, metal chopsticks with bamboo handles are preferred, as the tips of regular bamboo chopsticks discolor and get greasy after repeated use in hot oil. The bamboo handles protect against heat. Similarly, Vietnamese cooks use the oversized ƒë≈©a c·∫£ or \\"grand chopsticks\\" in cooking, serving rice from the pot. Styles Chopsticks on a store rack Chopsticks come in a wide variety of styles, with differences in geometry and material. Depending on the country and the region some chopstick styles are more common than others. * Length: Chopsticks are typically about tapering to one end. Very long, large chopsticks, usually about , are used for cooking, especially for deep frying foods. * Taper: Chopsticks are usually tapered in the end used for picking up food. Chinese chopsticks are more commonly blunt, while Japanese ones tend to be sharp and pointed in style. Korean chopsticks typically have sharp tapers, but with flatted grip. * Material: A large variety of materials is available, including bamboo, wood, plastic, metal, bone, jade, porcelain, and ivory. ** Bamboo and wood chopsticks are relatively inexpensive, low in temperature conduction, and provide good grip for holding food. They can warp and deteriorate with continued use if they are of the unvarnished or unlacquered variety. Almost all cooking and disposable chopsticks are made of bamboo or wood. Disposable unlacquered chopsticks are used especially in restaurants. These often come as a piece of wood that is partially cut and must be split into two chopsticks by the user (serving as proof that they have not been previously used). In Japanese, these disposable implements are known as waribashi () ** Plastic chopsticks are relatively inexpensive, low in temperature conduction, and resistant to wear. Melamine is one of the more commonly used plastics for chopsticks. Plastic chopsticks are not as effective as wood and bamboo for picking up food, because they tend to be slippery. Also, plastic chopsticks cannot be used for cooking, since high temperatures may damage the chopsticks and produce toxic compounds. ** Metal (commonly stainless steel) chopsticks are durable and easy to clean, but metal is slippery. Silver is still common among wealthy families, as are silver-tipped wooden or bone chopsticks, a common material for Korean chopsticks.See Aero, page 48 ** Other materials such as ivory, jade, gold, and silver are typically chosen for luxury. Silver-tipped chopsticks were often used as a precaution by wealthy people, as it was believed that the silver would turn black upon contact with poison. * Embellishments: Wooden or bamboo chopsticks can be painted or lacquered for decoration and waterproofing. Metal chopsticks are sometimes roughened or scribed to make them less slippery. Higher-priced metal chopstick pairs are sometimes connected by a short chain at the untapered end to prevent their separation. China Longer than most other styles at about , thicker, with squared or rounded sides and ending in either wide, blunt, flat tips or tapered pointed tips. Blunt tips are more common with plastic or melamine varieties whereas pointed tips are more common in wood and bamboo varieties. Chinese sticks may be composed of almost any material but the most common in modern-day restaurants is melamine plastic for its durability and ease of sanitation. The most common type of material in regular households is bamboo.  Japan  It is common for Japanese sticks to be of shorter length for women, and children's chopsticks in smaller sizes are common. Many Japanese chopsticks have circumferential grooves at the eating end, which helps prevent food from slipping. Japanese chopsticks are typically sharp and pointed. They are traditionally made of wood or bamboo, and are lacquered. Chopsticks were first used around 500AD when their use spread from China to many Asian countries. Lacquered chopsticks are known in Japanese as nuribashi, which has numbers of varieties, depending on where they are made and what types of lacquers are used in glossing them. Japan is the only place where they are decorated with natural lacquer making them not just functional but highly attractive. The Japanese traditional lacquered chopsticks are produced from the city of Obama in Fukui Prefecture, and come in many colors coated in natural lacquer and decorated with mother-of-pearl from abalone and with eggshell to impart a waterproof shield to the chopsticks extending their life.Megumi, I. (Producer), & Masahiko, H. (Director). (2009). Begin Japanology-Chopsticks [Video file]. Edo Kibashi chopsticks have been created by the hands of Tokyo craftspeople since the beginning of the Taish≈ç Period (1912-1926) roughly 100 years ago. These chopsticks are combined by high-grade wood (ebony, red sandalwood, ironwood, Japanese box-trees, maple), which craftspeople plane by hand.Edo Kibashi Chopsticks. (2019). Retrieved from https://japan-brand.jnto.go.jp/crafts/woodcraft/2784/ Edo Kibashi chopsticks, which are pentagonal hexagonal or octagonal, make them easy to hold. The tips of them are rounded to prevent to damage the dish or the bowl.NHK (Producer). (2006). Binotsubo-Chopsticks [Video file]. In Japan, chopsticks for cooking are known as ryoribashi, and as saibashi when used to transfer cooked food to the dishes it will be served in. Korea  Unique among East Asian cultures, chopsticks used by Koreans are often made of metal; depending on the historical era the metallic composition of Korean chopsticks varied (in the present day, the majority of Korean metal chopsticks are made of stainless steel (high-end sets, such as those intended as gifts, are often made of sterling silver), but in the past, such as during the Goryeo era, chopsticks were also made of bronze; during the Joseon era, chopsticks used by royalty were made of silver, as its oxidizing properties could often be used to detect whether or not food intended for royals had been tampered with). Chopsticks made of varying woods (typically bamboo) are also common in Korea. In North and South Korea, chopsticks of medium-length with a small, flat rectangular shape are paired with a spoon (also unique to Korea; most East Asian cultures have either eliminated the spoon or have a much more limited use of the utensil) made of the same, usually metal, material. The set is called sujeo (a portmanteau of the Korean words for spoon and chopsticks). A spoon and chopstick rest, which is the piece to rest sujeo without touching the table, is used in traditional eating. Many Korean metal chopsticks are ornately decorated at the grip. In the past, materials for sujeo varied with social class: Sujeo used in the court were made with gold, silver, cloisonn√© and so on, while commoners usually used brass or wooden sujeo. Nowadays, sujeo is usually made with stainless steel, although bangjja is also popular in more traditional setting. Thailand Native cuisine uses a fork and spoon, adopted from the West. Ethnic Chinese immigrants introduced the use of chopsticks for foods that require them. Restaurants serving other Asian cuisines that utilize chopsticks use the style of chopstick, if any, appropriate for that cuisine. Vietnam Long sticks that taper to a blunt point; traditionally lacquered wood or bamboo. A ƒë≈©a c·∫£ (•ÆäÂ•á) is a large pair of flat chopsticks that is used to serve rice from a pot. Etiquette The proper way of holding chopsticks Chopsticks are used in many parts of the world. While principles of etiquette are similar, finer points can differ from region to region. Cambodia In Cambodia, a fork and spoon are the typical utensils used in Cambodian dining and etiquette. Spoons are used to scoop up food or water and the fork is there to help guide the food onto the spoon. Chopsticks are normally used in noodle dishes such as the Kuy Tiev and soup dishes. When eating soup the chopsticks will typically be paired with the spoon, where the chopsticks will pick up the food and the spoon will be used to drink the broth. Forks are never to touch the mouth, as it is thought as rude, thus they are not used to eat such dishes. China * When eating rice from a bowl, it is normal to hold the rice bowl up to one's mouth and use chopsticks to push or shovel the rice directly into the mouth. * It is acceptable to transfer food to closely related people (e.g. grandparents, parents, spouse, children, or significant others) if they are having difficulty picking up the food. Also, it is a sign of respect to pass food to the elderly first before the dinner starts. Often, family members will transfer a choice piece of food from a dish to a relative's bowl as a sign of caring. A variation of this is to transfer the food whilst using one's own bowl as a support, underneath the food and chopsticks to keep food from falling or dripping, then transferring from there to a relative's bowl. * It is poor etiquette to tap chopsticks on the edge of one's bowl; beggars make this sort of noise to attract attention. * Holding chopsticks incorrectly will reflect badly on a child's parents, who have the responsibility of teaching their children. * It is impolite to spear food with a chopstick. Anything too difficult to be handled with chopsticks is traditionally eaten with a spoon. * It is considered poor etiquette to point rested chopsticks towards others seated at the table. * Chopsticks should not be left vertically stuck into a bowl of rice because it resembles the ritual of incense-burning that symbolizes \\"feeding\\" the dead and death in general. This is also discouraged in South Korea and Japan. * Traditionally, everyone would use their own chopsticks to take food from the dishes to their own bowl, or to pass food from the dishes to the elders' or guests' bowls. Today usually only in restaurants or gatherings with non-family guests present, serving chopsticks (ÂÖ¨Á≠∑, \\"community-use chopsticks\\") are used. These are used to take food directly from serving dishes; they are returned to the dishes after one has served oneself. Due to better education regarding sanitary eating practices, many families are adopting this practice at private meals as well. Alternately, they can be left stationary on the table, especially in front of the host at the head of the table, so that the host can politely serve his honored guests on his left and right (and so they can serve him in return) without using their eating chopsticks. * When seated for a meal, it is common custom to allow elders to take up their chopsticks before anyone else. * Chopsticks should not be used upside-down; it is considered acceptable to use them inverted to stir or transfer the food from another plate (which the person does not intend to consume completely). This method is used only if there are no serving chopsticks. * One should not \\"dig\\" or \\"search\\" through food for something in particular. This is sometimes known as \\"digging one's grave\\" or \\"grave-digging\\" and is extremely poor form. * When taking food from a communal serving dish, one's chopsticks should not pass over someone else's chopsticks, hand, or arm; the diner should either take food to the side or wait. * When taking food from a communal serving dish, it is done with the palm uppermost, as it is considered rude to show one's knuckles to dining companions. Japan Various chopstick rests * The pointed ends of the chopsticks should be placed on a chopstick rest when the chopsticks are not being used. However, when a chopstick rest is not available as is often the case in restaurants using waribashi (disposable chopsticks), a person may make a chopstick rest by folding the paper case that contained the chopsticks. * Reversing chopsticks to use the opposite clean end is commonly used to move food from a communal plate, and is acceptable if there are no communal chopsticks (for example, if the meal is hosted at someone's home).It's not exactly good manners to use reversing chopsticks(ÈÄÜ„ÅïÁÆ∏-Sakasabashi). The reason for this is in the chopsticks called Iwai-bashi(Á•ù„ÅÑÁÆ∏). There is a type of celebratory chopsticks that have sharp ends so that both ends can be used. But one side is not for man to use. One side is supposed to be used by man and the other side is supposed to be used by God. * Chopsticks should not be crossed on a table, as this symbolizes death, or vertically stuck in the rice, which is done during a funeral. * Chopsticks should be placed right-left direction; the tips should be on the left. * In formal use, disposable chopsticks (waribashi) should be replaced into the wrapper at the end of a meal.  Korea  Simple Korean table (chopsticks and a spoon placed palewise, on the right side of rice and soup) In Korea, chopsticks are paired with a spoon (the set is called sujeo). * Sujeo are placed on the right side and parallel to bap (rice) and guk (soup). Chopsticks are laid on the right side of the paired spoon. One must never put the chopsticks to the left of the spoon. Chopsticks are only laid to the left during the food preparation for the funeral or the memorial service for the deceased family members, known as jesa. * Spoon is used for bap (rice) and soupy dishes, while most other banchan (side dishes) are eaten with chopsticks. * It is considered uncultured and rude to pick up a plate or a bowl to bring it closer to one's mouth, and eat its content with chopsticks. If the food lifted \\"drips\\", a spoon is used under the lifted food to catch the dripping juices. Otherwise however, holding both a spoon and chopsticks in one hand simultaneously or in both hands is usually frowned upon. Thailand Historically, Thai people used bare hands to eat and occasionally used a spoon and fork for curries or soup, an impact from the west. Many Thai noodle dishes, such as pad thai, are eaten with chopsticks. * Using chopsticks and spoon only for specific dishes, such as noodles. * When a diner finishes their dish, they put their chopsticks on the bottom of the bowl. * Chopsticks should not be left stuck into a bowl with food, as this symbolises \\"feeding for dead people\\". * It is considered impolite to make a sound with chopsticks.http://www.lib.ru.ac.th/journal/chopstriks.html * It is poor etiquette to rest or hold chopsticks pointing towards others, as pointing is considered disrespectful. * Chopsticks should not be used with a bowl of rice. Vietnam * Unlike with Chinese dishes, it is also permitted to use chopsticks to pick up rice from plates, such as fried rice. * One should not pick up food from the table and place it directly in the mouth; food must be placed into one's own bowl first. * Chopsticks should not be placed in the mouth while choosing food. * Chopsticks should never be placed in a \\"V\\" shape when done eating; this is interpreted as a bad omen. * The individual's chopsticks should not be dipped into a communal soup bowl (for example, when eating canh chua). * Reversing the ends of the individual's chopsticks to the \\"clean ends\\" is preferred if communal serving utensils are not provided. Environmental impact Disposable chopsticks in a university cafeteria recycle bin in Japan The most widespread use of disposable chopsticks is in Japan, where around a total of 24 billion pairs are used each year, which is equivalent to almost 200 pairs per person yearly. In China, an estimated 45 billion pairs of disposable chopsticks are produced yearly. This adds up to of timber or 25 million fully grown trees every year. In April 2006, China imposed a 5% tax on disposable chopsticks to reduce waste of natural resources by overconsumption. This measure had the most effect in Japan as many of its disposable chopsticks are imported from China, which account for over 90% of the Japanese market. American manufacturers have begun exporting American-made chopsticks to China, using sweet gum and poplar wood as these materials do not need to be artificially lightened with chemicals or bleach, and have been seen as appealing to Chinese and other East Asian consumers. The American-born Taiwanese singer Wang Leehom has publicly advocated the use of reusable chopsticks made from sustainable materials. In Japan, reusable chopsticks are known as . Health effects A 2006 Hong Kong Department of Health survey found that the proportion of people using distinctly separate serving chopsticks, spoons, or other utensils for serving food from a common dish has increased from 46% to 65% since the SARS outbreak in 2003.

The criminal organization he served was headed by his older brother Peter Milano. His nickname was \\"Flipper\\", after the TV dolphin. Biography Early life Carmen Milano was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1929 to Anthony and Josephine Milano (n√©e DiSanto). His family was of Calabrian origin and he had three brothers, John, Frank, and Peter. His father was Mafioso Anthony Milano, who was underboss of the Cleveland crime family from 1930 until his retirement in 1976. His uncle Frank Milano was boss of the Cleveland family and sat on the original Commission from 1930 until 1935, when he fled the country to avoid charges for tax evasion. Carmen moved with his mother and siblings to Beverly Hills, California when he was a teenager after his mother developed cancer. His father, who had rackets and business interests in both Ohio and California, split time between the two states. When the brothers graduated high school, Peter decided to stay in Los Angeles and work with Jewish gangster Mickey Cohen. Carmen decided to attend Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles and after graduating was accepted to Loyola Law School.Carmen Joseph Milano - #25733 Attorney Profile at the State Bar of California During his attendance he was a member of the Phi Delta Phi fraternity.Carmen J. Milano profile at the International League Fraternity of Phi Delta Phi While in law school he became engaged to Geraldine Giesler, the daughter of prominent criminal defense lawyer Jerry Giesler. On January 5, 1955 Milano was admitted to the State Bar of California. Afterwards Milano moved back to Cleveland to pursue a career as an attorney. Mafia associate and burglar Phil Christopher described parties Milano would host at the Italian American Brotherhood Club in Little Italy, Cleveland in the late 1970s. The club was owned by Carmen's father and were attended by mobsters, businessman and politicians alike. During the 1970s Milano was paid a retainer for few, if any, legal services to Teamsters Local 410 and 436, which are labor unions that were allegedly controlled by Milano's father.Organized Crime and the Labor Unions. Prepared for the White House in 1978. RE: Chicago Laborers. Exscript 1, Exscript 2 Milano eventually was disbarred from practicing law in an incident involving fraudulent workers' compensation claims. Underboss In 1984 Milano decided to move back to California where his older brother was now running the Los Angeles crime family. He initially resided with Los Angeles crime family caporegime (Captain) Luigi \\"Louie\\" Gelfuso, before owning and maintaining his own residence in the Tarzana district of Los Angeles. In 1984, Peter Milano became the official boss of the L.A. family and shortly after, Carmen became a made man and became his underboss. Carmen's primary role was to insulate Peter from the lower ranking members of the family, thereby protecting Peter from law enforcement scrutiny. Carmen Milano also had mob connections in Cleveland and in the East Coast, which included New York bosses Anthony \\"Tony Ducks\\" Corallo and Anthony Salerno. Kenny Gallo described him as the tougher of the two brothers. L.A. mobster turned government witness Anthony Fiato once described Milano after their first encounter: Milano was among 20 reputed organized crime figures arrested in 1984, in what law enforcement officials said was a bid to take over a $1 million-a-week bookmaking operation in Los Angeles. Neither of the Milano brothers (nor six of the others originally arrested) were charged due to lack of evidence. On May 21, 1987 the entire hierarchy of the L.A. family was indicted for violating the R.I.C.O. Act after a 2-year investigation by the F.B.I. On March 29, 1988 Milano plead guilty to conspiring to extort money out of loan shark victims who had unpaid debts. In exchange for the plea, he received a six- month prison sentence and 3 years probation, but never admitted to being a part of the Mafia. While his brother received jail time, Carmen Milano ran the family as acting boss, taking care of the depleted business until his brother was released in 1991. Las Vegas In the early 1990s, Milano moved to Las Vegas, Nevada and was in control of the L.A. family's interests in the city. In 1998 Milano was one of several people named in a series of indictments that stemmed from a two-year investigation of organized crime in Southern Nevada. Milano admitted developing a fraudulent diamond scheme in the winter of 1996 with Herbert Blitzstein that was never carried out and laundering $50,000 from a food stamp fraud. In 2000, he was sentenced to 21 months in prison by federal judge Philip Martin Pro. During the investigation Milano admitted to being the underboss of the L.A. family and that his brother was boss. This violated the Mafia's oath of Omert√†. He considered becoming a government witness, but changed his mind. Despite this Peter Milano sought no reprisals for his brother's betrayal, who continued to remain underboss when released from prison. During the investigation, former FBI agent Bob Hammer was quoted as saying: Hammer, however, was also impressed by his manners and intelligence: Milano was released from prison on February 27, 2002. Milano died January 3, 2006 at Spring Valley Hospital of cardiac arrest and renal failure.

Convicted for robbery in 1795, he was sentenced in 1801 to transportation to Australia, one of 297 convicted felons aboard the vessels , and . Britain then maintained a penal settlement at Sydney Cove in the Colony of New South Wales. Security in the early penal settlements was reinforced by the isolation of the colony: guards trusted the Australian wilderness to kill any convicts who attempted to escape. Samuel succeeded in escaping and, with a gang, robbed the home of a wealthy woman, and in the process, a policeman named Joseph Luker, who was guarding her home, was murdered. The gang was hunted down and quickly captured, and during the trial, the woman recognised Joseph Samuel as one of the culprits. He confessed to robbing her home, but denied having murdered the policeman. The other members of the gang, including the leader, were acquitted due to lack of evidence, but because the woman identified Samuel, he was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Execution attempts On 26 September 1803, Samuel and another criminal, convicted of another crime and not a member of the same gang, were driven in a cart to Parramatta, where hundreds of people had gathered to watch the execution. Nooses were fastened securely around their necks from the gallows and after they were allowed to pray with a priest, the cart was driven away. This was the common method of hanging of the day, and caused death by slow strangulation. Not until the latter half of the 19th century did the British employ the drop method, which breaks the neck. The ropes used were made of five cords of hemp, which enabled one to hold 1,000 lb (~450 kg), for up to five minutes without breaking, more than sufficient for human executions. The other criminal ultimately died by strangulation, but Samuel's rope snapped and he dropped to his feet, sprained an ankle and collapsed. The executioner hastily readied another rope, also five-hemp, and placed it around Samuel's neck, forced him onto the same cart, and drove the cart away again. The other criminal was still kicking weakly at this point. When the cart drove out from under him, Samuel fell again, and the noose slipped off his neck, whereupon his boots touched the ground. The executioner was sure to have fastened the noose securely around his neck, and as he stood Samuel up to try again, the crowd had become boisterous, calling for Samuel to be freed. The executioner very quickly readied another five-hemp rope, ordered the cart driven back, forced Samuel onto it, fastened the noose around his neck, secured it very carefully and tightly, and then ordered the cart driven away. The rope snapped, and Samuel dropped to the ground and stumbled over, trying to avoid landing on his sprained ankle. Now the crowd stood around in an uproar, and another policeman, watching on horseback, ordered the execution delayed momentarily, while he rode away to find the governor. The governor was summoned to the scene and upon inspection of the ropes, which showed no evidence of having been cut, and the other criminal, who was successfully executed with an identical rope, the governor and the entire crowd agreed that it was a sign from God that Joseph Samuel had not committed any crime deserving of execution and his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment instead. Parramatta's town doctor tended to his sprained ankle.

It was a decisive Glarner victory despite being outnumbered sixteen to one. History The Battle of N√§fels was the last battle of the Swiss-Austrian conflicts that stretched through most of the 14th Century. A few weeks after the Battle of Sempach on 9 July 1386, the Old Swiss Confederation attacked and besieged the Habsburg village of Weesen on the Walensee. The following year, Glarus rose up against the Habsburgs and destroyed Burg Windegg. Then, on 11 March 1387, the valley council declared itself free of Habsburg control. In response, on the night of 21‚Äì22 February 1388, an Austrian army attacked the village of Weesen and drove off the Swiss forces. In the beginning of April, two Austrian armies marched out to cut off Glarus from the rest of the Confederation. The main army, with about 5,000 men, marched toward N√§fels under the command of the Graf Donat von Toggenburg and the Knight Peter von Thorberg. A second column, with about 1,500 men under the command of Graf Hans von Werdenberg-Sargans, marched over the Kerenzerberg Pass. Battle of N√§fels Monument to the Battle of N√§fels On 9 April 1388 the main army, under Toggenburg and Thorberg, attacked and captured the wall across the valley (Letzi) around N√§fels. The garrison, comprising about 400 Glarner troops and a few dozen troops from both Schwyz and Uri, held out for a short time, but was forced to withdraw into the hills. As they retired, the Austrian army spread out to plunder the villages and farms. The Glarners now emerged from the snow and fog to take the Austrians by surprise as they were preoccupied with looting. Following a brief battle, the disorganized Austrians broke and fled toward Weesen, but the collapse of the bridge over the Maag or Weeser Linth dropped much of their army into the river where they drowned. Seeing the destruction of the main column, Werdenberg- Sargans' army retreated to the village of Beglingen (now in the municipality of Mollis). The Glarner and Confederation army had about 54 men killed, who were buried at the parish church of Mollis. Habsburg losses are less well known, though are estimated to be between several hundred killed and 1,700. On 29 November 1389, the Abbot Bilgeri had about 180 bodies moved from the battlefield and reburied at R√ºti Abbey in the choir of the present R√ºti Reformed Church. Aftermath In 1389, a seven-years' peace was signed at Vienna, leaving the Confederation in undisputed possession of all the territory it had acquired in the recent war. In the same year, the first N√§felser Fahrt, a pilgrimage to the site of the battle was held. This pilgrimage, which still occurs, happens on the first Thursday in April and is in memory of the battle. The pilgrimage played an important role in the creation of the unified canton of Glarus.

Its outlet may have ultimately emptied into the Colorado River north of Blythe.  Geography  Lake Mojave existed in San Bernardino County. The city of Las Vegas lies northeast of Lake Mojave. On the western side, Lake Mojave was bordered by mountains that steeply rise from the basin. The eastern side is more gentle, featuring alluvial fans and pediment.  The lake  At its maximum stand, Lake Mojave had a surface area of and a volume of . Lake Mojave had two separate lake level stands, the A stand and the B stand. The A stand lies at an altitude of above sea level and the B stand at an altitude of . The lake was about deep. 15 alluvial fans abut the shores of Lake Mojave that face the Soda Mountains. A present-day bay exists on the northwestern side of the Silver Lake basin and includes wavecut terraces and a beach ridge. Silver Lake and Soda Lake exist today where Lake Mojave formerly existed. Soda Lake slopes to the north and lies at a higher altitude than Silver Lake, thus water tends to fill Silver Lake first. Beach ridges and shorelines testify to the existence of a past lake in the Silver Lake basin. One major beach ridge complex is named the El Capitan Beach Ridge complex and contains gravel and sand. Sediments from Lake Mojave and its two successor basins may be part of the sources of sand for the Kelso Dunes. Dating of dune deposition suggests that the deposition events often correspond to times where water levels in Lake Mojave were less stable.  Hydrology   Inflow  The Mojave River is the principal river reaching the Lake Mojave basin. Most water of the Mojave River ultimately comes from the San Bernardino Mountains, southwest. Precipitation increased in response to southward shifts of the polar jet stream; this and floods probably contributed to the formation of Lake Mojave. The Mojave River flows into the Mojave Desert since about 2‚Äì1.5 million years ago, when its previous southward course was blocked by the uplift of the Transverse Ranges. The Mojave River did not always end in Lake Mojave; at other points of its history it reached Lake Harper, Lake Manix, the Cronese Lakes and Lake Manly. Lake Mojave was reached about 20,000 years before present by water overflowing from Lake Manix. Compared to today, water flow would have to be at least ten times higher to allow for the formation of Lake Mojave.  Outflow  A bedrocklined channel extends from a bay on the northern side of Silver Lake and forms the outlet of Lake Mojave. It is at times less than wide. The channel terminates into Dry Lake playa, away. This spillway stabilized the levels of Lake Mojave during the late Pleistocene. It was once thought that overflow from Lake Mojave was nourishing a freshwater Lake Dumont, but later ostracod research indicated that that area was groundwater-supported wetland. Water from Lake Mojave eventually reached the Amargosa River and Death Valley. In 1916-1917 the outlet channel was deepened in order to lower water levels. Before that, the floor of the channel had an elevation of .  Climate  Present day climate in the area is hot and dry. On average, summer temperatures exceed . Average precipitation is about . Most of it falls during winter and early spring, with about one quarter coming during summer from the Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico. This low precipitation contrasts to a high evaporation rate of .  Biology  A number of shells of Anodonta californiensis have been found at Lake Mojave. Phacotus freshwater algae developed in early Holocene lake stages. Ostracods of Lake Mojave include Limnocythere bradburyi and Limnocythere ceriotuberosa. Lake Mojave was surrounded by a mix of pinyon-juniper and Joshua tree woodlands down to altitudes of and desert vegetation. Present-day vegetation in the area includes creosote bush, saltbush and Opuntia. There is more vegetation in washes and on river terraces.  Chronology  Lake Mojave existed between 22,000 and 9,000 years before present. Based on the Wells chronology, the lake filled before 27,000 years before present and from then on fluctuated below the A-shoreline. The lake was stable at the A-shoreline 21,900 - 19,750 and 16,850 - 13,850 years before present. The early phase is also known as Lake Mojave I, while later phases are also known as Lake Mojave II. Alternative age ranges are 20,900 - 19,600 for Lake Mojave I and 16,500 - 13,400 for Lake Mojave II. Water draining from Lake Manix after the formation of Afton Canyon may have aided in the development of Lake Mojave, although much of the water would have continued into Death Valley due to the insufficient volume of the Lake Mojave basin. Between 13,600 and 11,500 years before present, the formation of a spillway caused Lake Mojave to abandon its A-shoreline and drop to the B-shoreline. Lake Mojave stabilized at the B-shoreline until 8,700 years before present. Other estimates assume a drying about 9,700 years before present. The disappearance of Lake Mojave was caused by climatic changes at the start of the Holocene. Wind erosion affected the beach and delta deposits left by Lake Mojave, forming aeolian sediments. Presently, only rarely do lakes form in the basin of Lake Mojave. Individual occurrences occurred in 1916‚Äì1917, 1938-1939 and 1969; this latter lake stage was photographed and it submerged the Tonopah and Tidewater railroad. Other infillings occurred 3,910 ¬± 152 and 470 ¬± 160 years ago. Such resurgences of the lake depend on anomalously high precipitation on the San Bernardino Mountains, and are climatically linked to the Little Ice Age and other glacial expansion episodes. The existence of such lakes was not only limited by climate factors but also by a generally shallow lake basin that caused a strong increase in evaporation with only slight increases in water levels.  Archaeology  A steady food and freshwater supply as well as the presence of rocks that could be used to manufacture tools drew early humans towards Lake Mojave. As lake levels dropped, people migrated progressively farther down to reach the lake. Some presumably archaeological sites have been found at Lake Mojave, including alignments of basalt boulders. Bifaces and projectiles have been found on its shores, the latter are dated about 10,000 - 8,000 years before present, these archaeological findings are known as the \\"Lake Mojave\\" complex. The so-called \\"Lake Mojave complex\\" is a cultural system that was active between 9,000 and 6,000 BC. Possibly, such cultures were derived from the Clovis culture and formed when big mammals disappeared and early humans had to search for different sources of food.

By the early 1920s, Clawson was chief cinematographer for popular star Anita Stewart at Louis B. Mayer Productions, but later in the decade, he often worked as a second cameraman. He was lead cinematographer on the early talkie Syncopation, but his few remaining published credits are for expedition films such as Hunting Tigers in India (1929) and low-budget East Coast productions such as The Black King and The Horror (both 1932).

Operated at various times in the 19th century, it was deactivated sometime after 1870. This range was eventually succeeded by the Nantucket Harbor Range Lights, which are still in operation. History There have been many lights at Brant Point, dating to well before the American Revolution. The history of range lights is a bit murky, and different sources give different dates. A researcher for the Coast Guard historical office dates a separate range beacon to 1794, but congressional records show this beacon established in 1820. Correspondence from 1838 describes the original beacon as an tall building with a two oil lanterns hung in it; in 1856 this was replaced with a pyramidal tower housing a reflector lamp, as pictured. This structure was relocated many times, and in 1869 was positioned on Brant Point itself as the front light of the range; this proved unsatisfactory, and the light was moved back across the harbor the following year. Land was acquired around 1872 to relocate the light again and to provide for a keeper's house. The date for removal of this light is unclear. An 1879 chart shows the beacon, and the following year's chart omits it; this is not a definitive indication, however, since no edition of the same chart prior to 1879 shows the beacon, even though other documents state it to have been operating. In the early 20th century new range lights were built on Brant Point, and the light itself was relocated to a new tower, obviating a separate rear range light.

It's called Rob Zombie, but we're treating it like a band.\\" Rob Zombie enlisted the help of artists Dan Brereton (creator of Nocturnals), Alex Horley (of Image Comics and DC Comics) and David Hartman (storyboard artist) to create the album artwork. British dark/horror/science fiction/steampunk artist Sam Shearon aka 'Mister-Sam' (artwork for Godhead, Ministry, A Pale Horse Named Death, IDW Publishing, and tour merchandise for Iron Maiden and HIM) also contributed to the artwork of Hellbilly Deluxe 2. Rob Zombie began touring in support of the new album shortly before its release date. The first leg of the Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour featured Nekromantix and Captain Clegg & The Night Creatures, the fictional band from Halloween II. Uncle Seymour Coffins, also from Halloween II, hosted the Los Angeles show on Halloween night. The song, \\"What?\\", the first single from the album, starting playing on radio stations October 6 and was released on iTunes October 13. Another new song, \\"Burn\\", was released on Rock Band on October 27 as part of a triple pack which also includes the hits \\"Dragula\\" and \\"Superbeast\\". \\"Burn\\" was later released as a free download on December 17, 2009 via the band's website. Reissue Tommy Clufetos, the drummer on the studio recordings for Hellbilly Deluxe 2, left the band in early 2010 to play drums for Ozzy Osbourne on the album Scream. Clufetos was replaced by Murderdolls guitarist and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison initially as a touring member. Before joining the 2010 Mayhem Festival, Jordison joined Zombie, John 5 and Piggy D. to record some new songs. These tracks were described by Zombie as \\"some of the fastest and heaviest tracks we have recorded in a long, long time.\\" John Tempesta, former member of White Zombie and drummer on Zombie's early solo albums, was going to be featured on a song called \\"Loving the Freaks\\" during these sessions, and Rob Zombie confirmed that working with Tempesta was planned but never took place due to schedule conflicts. The three new tracks recorded with this lineup, \\"Devil's Hole Girls and the Big Revolution,\\" \\"Michael\\" and \\"Everything Is Boring,\\" were released as bonus tracks on the reissue of Hellbilly Deluxe 2 as tracks 1, 14 and 8 respectively. The updated version was released on September 28, 2010 through Roadrunner Records. Along with new artwork, the reissue also contains a new version of \\"The Man Who Laughs\\", most notably replacing the original drum solo with a mandolin solo instead and is about two minutes shorter than the original. The intro to \\"Mars Needs Women\\" has been separated into the track \\"Theme for an Angry Red Planet\\". Also included is a bonus DVD containing a 30-minute tour documentary titled \\"Transylvanian Transmissions.\\" Reception Hellbilly Deluxe 2 received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the album earned a score of 63/100 based on ten reviews. The album debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 49,000 copies in its first week of release.

Miami Horror was initially formed by its producer and DJ, Benjamin Plant who began it as a solo project. In addition to Plant, the band features Josh Moriarty (guitars and vocals), Daniel Whitechurch (keyboards), and currently Rhythm Luna (drums), though they often feature different vocalists. The band takes influence from dance and rock artists of the 1970s and 1980s such as Prince, New Order, Todd Rundgren, and Pink Floyd, combining it with modern production techniques from styles such as house and pop music. Plant debuted in the music scene with his EP Bravado, released in 2008. His debut album Illumination was released in 2010 and debuted at Number 10 on the Australian Chart, which featured collaborations with the aforementioned Josh Moriarty and Daniel Whitechurch, along with features from Neon Indian and Kimbra, while their second more collaborative album, All Possible Futures, in 2015. A second EP titled The Shapes followed in 2017 as a conceptual effort to explore a new sound. Additionally, they have remixed songs from other artists such as Gorillaz, Pnau, and Phantogram, among others. Currently, they are working on their as-of-yet untitled third studio album, slated for a release in late 2020. Biography In 2007, Plant began releasing remixes under the moniker Miami Horror; their instantaneous blog success led him to leave film school and pursue a career in music. A series of both bootleg and official remixes included Stardust's \\"Music Sounds Better with You\\" and Tegan and Sara's \\"Walking with a Ghost\\", along with contemporary Australian acts such as the Midnight Juggernauts, Faker, and The Presets. According to Plant, the name Miami Horror \\"was just a visual thing. I thought both words were pretty bold in themselves, but also have quite a strong visual side. Miami representing the colorful and flamboyant side, while horror represents the darker.\\" He has said that he \\"didn't like it for the first two weeks\\", but he \\"learnt to live with it\\". Plant began his music career early on, producing music at home from a young age, often DJing at house parties and regular weekly Melbourne club nights such as Streetparty and Third Class. In 2008 he remixed Pnau, The Presets, and Bloc Party. Miami Horror has also collaborated with Melbourne electropop group Gameboy/Gamegirl in 2007 and produced the Golden Ghetto Sex EP which featured the single \\"Sweaty Wet/Dirty Damp\\", a one-off single that became a left-field hit in the music blogosphere the same year. As Miami Horror, Plant made his commercial debut in 2008 with a five-track EP, Bravado, on Virgin Records. The EP features the song \\"Don't Be on with Her\\", for which a promotional video was released online. Miami Horror has since been signed to EMI for distribution in Australia and France. Miami Horror's live show is formed by Benjamin Plant (bass, keyboards), Josh Moriarty (guitars and vocals), Daniel Whitechurch (bass, keyboards, and guitars), and Rhythm Luna(drums) with various other members depending on the tour. The live incarnation of Miami Horror has appeared at Coachella, Corona Capital, Governors Ball, Groovin The Moo, Splendour in the Grass, Electric Forest and many more. The band has also supported Phoenix, and Friendly Fires on their Australian tours. In late 2009 the band released their first major single \\"Sometimes\\" to commercial success, receiving frequent airplay on radio stations and club circuits. They later released their debut album Illumination on 20 August 2010 with debuted at number 10 on the ARIA Charts, with further singles including \\"Moon Theory\\" and \\"I Look to You\\" (the latter featuring Kimbra), each single receiving a music video alongside them. The fourth single, \\"Holidays\\", received a music video as well. In 2013, \\"Sometimes\\", was included as part of the Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack. The same year, single \\"Real Slow\\" was released, and a follow-up single, \\"Colours in the Sky\\", was released that November. In 2014, another single, \\"Wild Motion (Set It Free)\\" was released. The band's second album All Possible Futures, was released on 21 April 2015. It debuted at number 65 on the ARIA Albums Chart in May 2015, with later singles including \\"Love Like Mine\\", and \\"Celloplane (So Cruel). The band performed at Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival, Corona Capital Festival, Electric Forest, and many other festivals in support of All Possible Futures. The departure of Aaron Shanahan was announced on 12 December 2016. The next year, the band independently released the EP The Shapes, featuring the single \\"Leila\\" which reached commercial success and frequent airplay in Japan, as well as Latin America where a Spanish version of \\"Leila\\" was also released and serviced to radio. Miami Horror produced and curated their own highly successful block parties in Sydney, Melbourne, and New York with acts like Touch Sensitive, Running Touch, and Late Nite Tuff Guy. In both the summer and autumn of 2019 the group released two new singles, \\"Restless\\" and \\"Luv Is Not Enough\\", along with the announcement of work beginning on their third studio album, due out by late-2020.

The Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation, or IGPC, is a philatelic agency that represents over 70 different countries in the design, production, and marketing of postage stamps. It also assists postal administrations with the running of their postal services. IGPC claim to produce nearly half of the different postage stamps issued each year but have been criticised for inappropriate and excessive issues.  Legal status  IGPC is a private business, not an international organisation. It is run for profit and countries using its services are customers, not members.  Origins  The IGPC was founded by businessman Dr. Manfred Lehmann (1922‚Äì1997). Lehmann had taken an interest in the development of newly independent countries in Africa and the Caribbean. The IGPCs first country client was the newly independent Ghana (formerly the colony of Gold Coast) who in 1957 appointed them to help with the distribution of their stamps and the administration of their post offices. The following year Togo became a client of IGPC and, later, Caribbean countries too. The fall of communism created more clients for IGPC and by the late 1980s IGPC had over 50 client countries.About IGPC IGPC, 2003. Retrieved 7 August 2013. Archived here. A key development was obtaining the permission of the Disney company to use their cartoon characters on stamps during the 1979 International Year of the Child.\\"The Great Stamp Swindle?\\" by Karen Foy in Stamp & Coin Mart, March 2008, p.15. Disney themed stamps have since become an important part of the company's output.  Stamp issues  The IGPC is particularly noted for the issue of stamps featuring popular thematic subjects, cartoon characters and individuals from sport and entertainment that have been criticised as having little connection with the culture or history of the issuing countries. The mass issue of stamps featuring images from American pop culture has even been called a form of cultural imperialism.Miller, Toby & Geoffrey Lawrence \\"Globalization and Culture\\", Chapter 28 in A Companion to Cultural Studies. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2006. Examples of inappropriate issues might be those from Tuvalu, a small group of Polynesian islands in the South Pacific and an IGPC client, whose stamps have featured the American artist Norman Rockwell and the Chinese New Year. And in 2008, IGPC clients Gambia, Guyana, and Sierra Leone issued stamps to commemorate the 11 Israeli athletes killed during the hostage taking at the Munich 1972 Olympic Games. In their own words \\"The New York based philatelic agency was the first to engage in depicting high profile icons and recognized motifs on in order to assist its clients in releasing a new breed of postage stamps, which honor pop culture and sport heroes of the day including Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Pok√©mon, Popeye, John Lennon, the Walt Disney cartoon characters and classic motion pictures, Jackie Chan, Barbra Streisand, Bob Dylan, Major League Baseball, NFL Superbowl (sic), and the Sylvester Stallone 'Rocky' motion pictures to name just a few.\\"About IGPCi IGPC, 2008. IGPC has replied to charges of inappropriate issues by saying that \\"Pop culture stamps are only about 10 percent of what we do, even though they get most of the attention, insists Lonnie Ostrow, an I.G.P.C. spokesman. The rest are what we call 'definitives' -- the usual flags, flowers, fearless leaders and dead presidents.\\" According to IGPC, they employ a research team of over 100 members, and use over 300 freelance stamp artists. IGPC state that they have \\"...a full-time staff of graphic designers and in-house artists who can create a stamp design literally overnight.\\"  Sponsorship  IGPC has a program of sponsorship of philatelic events and postal services. Thematic stamp shows have been sponsored in the United States in support of one of IGPC's key markets and in 2007 the company provided 12 vehicles to the new Liberian post office. In 2006 IGPC had printed the first stamps of Liberia since the end of the civil war.

In 1915, he joined the Exposition Players‚Äô Corporation, official cinematographers of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, where he headed photographic and lab operations. When the exposition closed in 1916, he spent four months in Colorado, making scenic films for the Denver Tourist Bureau. Returning to Hollywood, Griffin signed on with the National Film Corporation, where he shot some 25 comedies featuring National‚Äôs owner, William ‚ÄúSmiling Bill‚Äù Parsons. His best-remembered film is the Lon Chaney vehicle Nomads of the North (1920), which was filmed for the National Film Corporation but was released through the Associated First National Exhibitors Circuit after Parsons‚Äô untimely death caused the NFC to close. Through the early 1920s, Griffin ground out low-budget Westerns starring Bob Custer, Franklyn Farnum and Al Hoxie. In the mid-1920s, he gave up wide-open spaces for the great indoors and shot a number modest melodramas, such as Rose of the Bowery (1927) and The Heart of Broadway (1928).

He lives in Los Angeles, CA. He received an M.M. degree in music composition from The Juilliard School, where he studied with John Corigliano, and a B.A. from Columbia University, where he studied with David Rakowski and Jonathan Kramer. He also studied with George Tsontakis and Christopher Rouse.  Musical work  Friedman's work has received positive reviews.A New York Times review called it \\"impossible to resist\\". NY Times- February 4, 2008Sequenza 21 review said \\"[Friedman] goes a lot further toward sustaining interest and tension than composers twice his age (and with Pulitzer Prizes).\\" Sequenza 21-Saturday, April 30, 2005 His pieces have been performed throughout the United States and abroad, including at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall and Avery Fisher Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall, the Hollywood Bowl, and the American Academy in Rome. Friedman was commissioned three times by Leonard Slatkin and the National Symphony Orchestra: * March, * The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly * Sacred Heart: Explosion March is a brief closing piece, commissioned by the orchestra as part of the Hechinger Encores series. The Throne and Sacred Heart are the second and third sections of a planned orchestral trilogy entitled In the Realms of the Unreal, each movement of which is based on the life and work of a different American outsider or visionary artist. The Throne is a musical depiction of Washington outsider artist James Hampton's (1909-1964) sculptural work of the same name. After its premiere, The Washington Post described the piece as having \\"ambitious scale and complexity\\"Washington Post-September 30, 2007 The piece has subsequently been performed by the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center's Avery Fischer Hall, and by the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. Sacred Heart: Explosion was commissioned in October 2007, as a revised version of something Friedman wrote while a student at Juilliard. This is based on the work of visionary artist Henry Darger, of Chicago (1892-1972).After the premiere, The Washington Times reported that it was \\"thoroughly modern, highly intelligent music.\\" Washington Times - October 6, 2007 It was performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in June 2008, and included in the 2008 exhibit \\"Dargerism: Contemporary Artists and Henry Darger\\" at The American Folk Art Museum in New York Other works include two string quartets, No. 2 and No. 3, written for the Chiara String Quartet.Sequenza 21 reported about quartet No. 3, \\" about two-thirds of the way through, something special happens... one realizes one has just heard something a little amazing.\\"Sequenza 21-Saturday, April 30, 2005 String Quartet No. 2 was published by G. Schirmer, Inc. as part of the New American Voices series, and recorded by The Corigliano Quartet for their Naxos debut CD.No. 2 was performed with choreography by Brian Reeder at Columbia University's Miller Theatre. Selections from both quartets were performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, in a festival honoring John Corigliano's 70th birthday. Friedman also composed two pieces for a concert at the Miller Theater in February 2009: a solo piano piece written for Simone Dinnerstein, and a set of songs for rock singer and chamber ensemble, performed by Craig Wedren. With the exception of String Quartet No. 2, his catalog is self- published by Montana 59 Music.  Recognition and other work  Friedman received awards for his work at Juilliard, and later received the 2004 Rome Prize Fellowship in Musical Composition, and the Leo Kaplan Award and Morton Gould Award from the ASCAP. In addition to his composition, Mr. Friedman has performed with a number of rock bands, including Shudder To Think, and the electronic music duo Matmos, contributing string arrangements for their album The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast. In 2012 his String Quartet No. 3 was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition.

The first pager-like system was used in 1921 by the Detroit Police Department. However, the first pager that we would today recognize as such was Motorola's Pageboy I. It was introduced in 1964 by the company and could selectively deliver a radio message to a particular individual. It used a high-band VHF frequency (from 150 to 170 MHz), or a UHF frequency (from 464 to 475 MHz), and they ran on a rechargeable 4.4 Volt mercury or 3.6 Volt nickel- cadmium battery (NiCd). The first implementation of the Pageboy alarm receiver could only give an attention tone, had no display and could not store messages. However, it was portable and notified the wearer that a message had been sent. Later versions of the Pageboy were able to deliver tone & voice. The Motorola Pageboy used to be very popular with fire brigades as an alarm receiver and, thanks largely to the success of this initial venture, pagers quickly began to replace public announcement systems in hospital and factories. The pager was activated by a 2-tone code, after which a voice message was transmitted. The successor of this device was the Motorola Pageboy II.

He Grew up in a family of six, five brothers and one sister, one of the brothers was former Managing Director of Hallmark Bank Marc Wabara. Senate career Adolphus Wabara was elected to the Senate in 1999, and reelected in 2003. He was president of the Senate of Nigeria from 2003 to 2005. In the April 2003 election Wabara was first declared the loser to D.C. Imo, candidate of the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP), but won a court appeal in June 2003 and was declared elected. The decision was controversial. At a Commonwealth meeting in December 2003, Adolphus Wabara said that \\"Responsive and responsible governance should be the keyword ... as it is the only instrument for promoting democratic values, wealth creation and people‚Äôs empowerment.\\" In May 2004 senators moved to investigate Wabara over alleged financial misdeeds. President Olusegun Obasanjo supported the decision. The senators accused Wabara of exceeding his authority by handing out various contracts without the knowledge or approval of the responsible Senate committee. An additional allegation was made by Senator Bode Olowoporoku, who denied receiving a N 3 million advance that the Senate President said had been paid to him for a tour of Europe and Latin America. Wabara said he was ready for the probe, and said the allegations were false, raised by Igbo senators who wanted his position. In February 2005 at a reception hosted by the Chinese embassy, Wabara confirmed Nigerian support for the One China policy, and said the Senate would do all it could to foster the relationship with China. In April 2005 Wabara resigned from his position after allegations were made that he and others took a $400,000 bribe from the education minister, Fabian Osuji. He was succeeded by Senator Ken Nnamani. Fabian Osuji had been fired the month before for allegedly bribing Wabara and six other members of parliament to facilitate passage of his annual budget. After extended legal battles, on 1 June 2010 Wabara's charges were dropped. The court held that the charges were bogus and failed to disclose prima facie cases against the accused persons. The court held that the action of the federal government on the allegation was most embarrassing, barbaric and uncivilised because the accused persons had not made statements to any security agents before the broadcast trial and finally pronounced guilty.

It was opened in 1927 and closed in 1963. With a length of it was a major work of civil engineering and one of the longest such tunnels. Description The tunnel was the most challenging section of the Canal de Marseille au Rh√¥ne, which connected Marseille to the Rh√¥ne river. The canal has a total length of . The tunnel starts near the village of Le Rove, and runs through the Cha√Æne de l'Estaque at sea level. The tunnel is long, wide and high. The water depth is . It remains the biggest canal tunnel in the world, as far as shipping canals are concerned. As a part of the Canal de Marseille au Rh√¥ne, it used to connect the √âtang de Berre in the north with L'Estaque in the south, both hosting a part of Marseille's harbour. History The possibility of building a canal tunnel had been discussed for many years. A proposal was developed for the Marseille Chamber of Commerce in 1879 by the engineer Gu√©rard, but no action was taken until an act of 24 December 1903 authorized the project. The initial plan was for an wide tunnel, which would only allow one-way traffic at any time, but this was later increased to for two-way traffic despite the increase in cost. Preparatory work began in 1906. Underground work began in 1910, using compressed air hammers to break through the rock. The contractor simultaneously worked from the south and from the north, and on a ventilation tunnel. Geological studies had not indicated any aquifer, but in fact the work was seriously affected by various irruptions of water. Work accelerated after the declaration of World War I on 1 August 1914. The laborers included Spanish and Portuguese, who replaced Italians recalled to their country at the outbreak of war, and prisoners of war. On 19 February 1916 the central plug separating the north and south sections at from the south portal was destroyed by dynamite. On 7 May 1916 Marcel Sembat, Minister of Public Works, and Joseph Thierry, Under- secretary of State for War, inaugurated the Rove Tunnel and the first two cranes of Port-de-Bouc. After many delays, the full canal was finally opened to traffic in April 1927. It was closed in 1963 after a section of the tunnel collapsed.

It lies within San Bernardino County, California. Located close to Barstow, this lake had the shape of a cloverleaf and covered four basins named Coyote, Cady/Manix, Troy and Afton. It covered a surface area of and reached an altitude of at highstands, although poorly recognizable shorelines have been found at altitudes of . The lake was fed by increased runoff during the Pleistocene and overflowed into the Lake Mojave basin and from there to Lake Manly in Death Valley, or less likely into the Bristol Lake basin and from there to the Colorado River. The lake formed about 500,000 years before present, when the Mojave River left the Victorville area and started to drain into Manix and Lake Harper. The lake did not immediately include the Afton basin; its integration occurred only about 190,000 years ago, most likely due to a catastrophic flood. Lake Manix lasted until 25,000‚Äì13,800 years ago, when Afton Canyon formed, either through slow downcutting or a large outburst flood. The lake supported a rich ecosystem, including birds, fish, mammals and plants. A group of archeological finds in the area have been called, controversially, the \\"Lake Manix Industry\\".  Name  The name \\"Lake Manix\\" was bestowed upon the lake by J. P. Buwalda in 1913; Buwalda also named its fossil-bearing sediments \\"Manix Beds\\". The name was derived from the Manix railroad siding of the Union Pacific, east of Barstow.  Geography  Location of the Mojave Desert Lake Manix was located east of present-day Barstow and Daggett, close to the town of Manix, California. Lake Manix had a cloverleaf shape, formed by a northwestern Coyote Basin, a south-southeastern Troy Basin and an eastern-northeastern Afton Basin. The latter basin is heavily dissected in comparison to the first two. In the older history of the lake another basin named Cady Basin existed, before the Mojave River eroded through the Buwalda Ridge and connected it to the Afton Basin. This through- going erosion may have been assisted by the Manix Fault trace. A bedrock sill at separates the Coyote Basin from the rest of the lake basin. The total surface area of the lake is given by sources as . Earlier highstands may have reached Yermo, California. Yermo, together with Dunn and Newberry Springs, are present-day towns whose locations would have been close to the shore of, or submerged beneath, Lake Manix. The upper threshold of the lake reached above sea level; a shoreline at was later shown to be an error of measurement, although some poorly recognizable higher shorelines at have been found. The stability of the shoreline suggests that the lake either became much larger at that point or started to overflow. These shorelines are marked by beach bars and wavecut scarps, and at least one lagoon formed behind a beach bar. Other landforms include alluvial fans, deltas, mudflats and their deposits. Part of the shoreline was buried by deposits transported by the Mojave River; these include large parts of a shoreline. One island potentially existed in the middle of the lake; at a lake surface elevation of , the island would have become two islands separated by a narrow strait. The lake reached a depth of . The lake was surrounded by mountain chains: in clockwise order, the Cronese Mountains, the Cave Mountains, the Cady Mountains, the Newberry Mountains, the Calico Mountains and the Alvord Mountains. These mountains are principally of volcanic origin and contributed sediments to Lake Manix. The whole region was subject to strong tectonically driven deformation from the Eastern California Shear Zone. A number of faults in the region show evidence of Holocene activity, including the Calico Fault, the Camp Rock Fault, the Dolores Lake Fault, the Pisgah Fault and the Manix Fault. This last fault probably contributed to the formation of the drainage by shearing rocks along its path. Lake Manix looking towards Afton Canyon Distorted sediments, soil liquefaction remnants and sand blows have been identified in drilling cores from Lake Manix sediments; distorted sediments may be evidence that seismic activity occurred in the lake during its history. Earthquakes may have occurred on the several faults close to the lake and across the lake floor. The 1947 Manix earthquake occurred along the Manix fault. The Mojave River entered the lake from the west, probably forming a river delta. The most recent drainage from the lake was Afton Canyon, which drained the lake east towards Soda Lake, Silver Lake and eventually Death Valley. This draining cut deep into the sediments of Lake Manix, removing about of material and depositing it below Afton Canyon. The playas Coyote Lake and Troy Lake presently fill the eponymous basins of Lake Manix. In many places, wind- and water-driven erosion has removed deposits from Lake Manix and obscured shorelines. The present-day Interstate 40 and Interstate 15 cross the former lake bed of Lake Manix.  Hydrology  The Pleistocene lake system of the Mojave Desert During the ice ages, a number of lakes filled in the Great Basin and the southwestern United States. These lake fillings were influenced by shifts in storm tracks caused by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Changes in sea surface temperatures increasing moisture supply or increased supply from tropical regions may also have contributed to lake formation. Similar lakes included Lake Babicora, Lake Bonneville, Lake Estancia, Lake Lahontan, Lake Manly, Lake Owens, Lake Panamint, Lake Russell and Lake Searles. Some interglacials also featured the growth of lakes. Under present-day climate, runoff in the region is also influenced by the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, the Northern Annular Mode and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation; the Northern Annular Mode may have affected the infilling of Lake Manix as well. Course of the present-day Mojave River The Mojave River drained into Lake Manix, with the formation of the lake reflecting increased precipitation in the San Bernardino Mountains. Local arroyos also drained into the lake. It has been estimated that runoff had to increase by a factor of about ten to form Lake Manix. Lake Manix contained over of water, possibly as much as . Water levels in the lake frequently fluctuated by . It formerly was the Mojave River's terminal lake, and received about of sediment. The Coyote Basin was not permanently coupled to the main lake body; its relatively large surface area and consequently high evaporation would have stabilized lake levels when it was connected to Lake Manix proper. Tufa, a type of calcium carbonate deposit that develops in waterbodies, formed within Lake Manix. Based on information gleaned from fossil ostracods, Lake Manix was a well mixed lake, especially in summer; likely, no thermocline developed in it. While the lake may have been warm during oxygen isotope stage 12 and possibly nourished from early summer runoff, after that point it was much colder, with water temperatures not rising above . After oxygen isotope stage 5, the lake became warmer again. The environment of Lake Manix has been compared to shallow lakes in northern California that lie behind the Cascade Range. Lake Manix was not the only lake that formed on the Mojave River; Lake Mojave in the Silver Lake and Soda Lake basins was also formed by the river. While it was at first believed that the two lakes could not have existed simultaneously, it has been suggested that Lake Mojave could have formed when Lake Manix still existed. Water spilled from Lake Manix to Lake Mojave; possibly, Lake Manix overflowed to that basin through Baxter Wash from a spillway south of the present-day Afton Canyon at an altitude of . While it is reasonable to assume, however, that earlier highstands were stabilized by overflow, there is no physical evidence in Baxter Wash for an overflow path there. Whatever path overflow might have taken, Lake Mojave was nourished by such overflow. The Mojave River, together with the Amargosa River, formed Lake Manly in Death Valley; the disappearance of Lake Manix after the formation of Afton Canyon would have increased water supply to Death Valley as evaporation surfaces were reduced. Another theory assumes that the Troy Lake basin of Lake Manix might have spilled into Bristol Lake and from there into the Colorado River; this theory is viewed as questionable seeing as there is no evidence that Bristol Lake (which Lake Manix waters would have flowed through on the way to the Colorado) contained an overflowing lake, although paleocurrent data obtained from Lake Manix deposits may support it. Present-day Coyote subbasin Water levels in Lake Manix appear to have reached peaks during both cold and warm stages of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events, with a southward shift of storm activity and increased moisture supply triggering increased precipitation. The average storm track passes far north of the Mojave River headwaters, meaning that the river is exquisitely sensitive to changes in storm position.  Biology  Bird species whose skeletons have been found in sediments of Lake Manix include the western grebe and the white pelican. Other bird skeletons found there have been attributed to the species Aquila chrysaetos (Golden eagle), Branta canadensis (Canada goose), Ciconia maltha (an extinct stork), Erismatura jamaicensis (Ruddy duck), the genus Grus, Nyroca valisineria, Phalacrocorax auritus (double-crested cormorant), Phoenicopterus copei and Phoenicopterus minutus. These are typical lake-dwelling birds that have also been found at Fossil Lake in Oregon, and might indicate that the lake was a stopover for bird migrations. Mammal genera at Lake Manix included Canis, Felis, Equus, Camelops, Tanupolama, Ovis, Bison, Mammuthus and Nothrotherium. This fauna list, called \\"Camp Cady local fauna\\" after a Union Army post in the area, is not exhaustive. The freshwater clam Anodonta californiensis existed in Lake Manix, as well as gastropods. Anodonta especially was probably very common in Lake Manix and other paleolakes, considering the large shell deposits left by it. Fish species whose fossils have been found include the Mojave tui chub and stickleback. The Western pond turtle also existed in the lake. An abundance of Ostracod valves have been found in the Manix beds, including Limnocythere ceriotuberosa and other Limnocythere species. Subordinates include Candona species, Cypridopsis vidua, Heterocyphris incongruens, Limnocythere bradburyi, Limnocythere platyforma and Limnocythere robusta. Diatoms found at Lake Manix include Stephanodiscus species. Further evidence of microbial organisms are present in the Stromatolites developed in the lake. Lake Manix during the time of its existence featured reedy marshes surrounded by juniper-sage vegetation and Pinyon-juniper woodlands in the mountains. The present natural vegetation consists mostly of the creosote bush; starting in 1964, parts of the lake bed were used for groundwater- supported center pivot irrigation-driven agriculture before increasing water- pumping costs after 1980 caused their abandonment.  Climate  Present-day climates at the location of Lake Manix are dry and warm, with the mean temperature at Barstow . Precipitation is scarce, , while potential evaporation exceeds . In the Victorville area, winter is the season where most of the precipitation falls, while east of Barstow two wet seasons occur, one in winter and another in late summer.  History  Shorelines of Lake Manix Originally, the Mojave River flowed southward before tectonic changes forced its course into the Mojave Desert between 2 and 1.5 million years ago. At that point, the river ended at Victorville, and after 575,000‚Äì475,000 years ago, in Harper Lake. About 500,000 years ago, it reached the Cady Basin of Lake Manix, based on tephrochronological dating of the Bishop Tuff. At first, the river may have alternated between Harper Lake and Lake Manix. 190,000 years ago, Afton Basin was integrated with the other three basins, as the river cut through the Buwalda Ridge. The presence of deposits with chaotically bedded rocks suggests that the breakthrough took the form of a catastrophic flood. Afton Basin had a bottom at an altitude of before; as it was integrated into Lake Manix, sedimentation progressively filled it. The course change from Harper Lake to Lake Manix was not immediately stable; 25,000 years ago, the Mojave River was again filling both lakes before definitively shifting to Manix by 20,000 years before present. Conflicting interpretations of the history of Lake Manix exist, particularly for the late Pleistocene. One theory assumes three distinct highstands during the Pleistocene; they have been dated 33,500‚Äì30,500, 23,500‚Äì20,800 and 17,600‚Äì16,500 years ago. An alternative timeline assumes three highstands at 40,000‚Äì35,000, 33,000‚Äì20,000 and 27,000‚Äì25,000 radiocarbon years. Clusters of shells in highstand deposits are dated 36,000‚Äì33,000 and 26,500‚Äì21,500 years before present. Other theories assume eight highstands and unstable lake levels between 45,000 and 25,000 years before present. Yet another theory assumes four highstands during oxygen isotope stages 6, 4 and 2. Finally, radiocarbon dating in 2015 yielded highstand ages of 43,000, 39,700, 36,100, 34,100, 31,600, 30,800, 29,400, 27,200 and 25,600 years ago, coinciding with cold and wet periods in speleothem records in Arizona and New Mexico. The lake existed at least until 14,230 ¬± 1,325 years before present. Lake Manix drained when the Afton Canyon formed, possibly around 13,800 years before present; an earlier estimate of 14,000 years ago was later discarded. An alternative date is about 25,000 years before present. This emptying may have been quick, draining Lake Manix within a short time, perhaps as little as ten hours. The draining probably contributed to the \\"Lake Mojave II\\" highstand. After the initial catastrophic cutting, a slower incision further deepened the Afton Canyon. Alternative theories assume a much slower formation of the Afton Canyon outlet, based on the presence of several terraces and possible recessional landforms. , the formation speed question was still not settled. The formation of the path to Afton Canyon was probably aided by the Manix Fault, which had left easily eroded sediments. The Mojave River may have drained into the Coyote Basin even after the formation of Afton Canyon under the influence of faulting until headward erosion cut off that basin from the river flow about 9,000‚Äì7,500 years ago. Sediments transported through Afton Canyon during the event and afterwards have buried the landscape beneath Afton Canyon, potentially also contributing sand to the development of the Kelso Dunes. At present, almost all runoff of the Mojave River comes from the San Bernardino Mountains, and ground infiltration and water diversions mean the river ends in the Victorville area; only the biggest floods reach all the way to Soda Lake. Water occasionally also flows into the Cronese Lakes beneath the Afton Canyon.  Archeology  Lake Manix may have been important for early humans in the area. Radiocarbon dating attests to the presence of humans at Lake Manix around 11,500 years before present. Lithic artifacts have been found at the shorelines of Lake Manix. Some are of late Pleistocene age. Such artifacts include bifaces, disks, flakes and hammerstones, which were grouped as the \\"Lake Manix Industry\\". Their supposedly pre-Clovis origin was questioned for a number of reasons. Dates obtained on the desert varnish they were embedded in yielded ages of 400‚Äì32,000 years before present, indicating that these items have varying origins and cannot be considered part of one grouping.

Biography Born in Saint-R√©mi, Canada East (present-day Quebec), Cayer immigrated to the Malone, New York,http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cagha/civilwar/monterey/cayer.htm where he was known by the nickname \\"Frenchy\\". By the time of his enlistment in the U.S. Army in August 1861, his only surviving family was a brother living in New York. During the war, he served as a sergeant in Company A of the 14th Infantry Regiment. At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, he was captured but later was released and rejoined his unit. On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, when his company was devastated by a Confederate cavalry attack, Cayer picked up a flag from a dead color bearer and rallied the troops. He was wounded in May of the next year at the Battle of the Wilderness. On August 19, 1864, Cayer participated in the Battle of Globe Tavern near Petersburg, Virginia. After assaulting and capturing a railroad junction used by the Confederates to supply the besieged city of Petersburg, his unit prepared for an expected counterattack. When the attack came, all of the officers in Company A were killed or wounded. Cayer took command of the company and led it in the successful defense of their position. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor three years later, on February 15, 1867. His official Medal of Honor citation reads simply: \\"Commanded the regiment, all the officers being disabled.\\" Cayer remained in the Army for two years after the end of the war until being discharged at Fort Yuma in February 1867. He traveled to northern California, first living in San Francisco, and then working as a farmer in Alameda County and later Stanislaus County. He eventually settled in Salinas, where he was a foreman at Spence Ranch (later owned by Spreckels Sugar Company) and operated a cigar store. He was active in many civic and fraternal organizations in Salinas, including the Freemasons. Admitted to Jim Bardin Hospital with intestinal trouble in February 1909, Cayer seemed to be making a recovery until his sudden death on February 7. He was buried at Garden of Memories Memorial Park in Salinas.

Early life Crowninshield was born on October 13, 1867 in New York City. He grew up in Marblehead, Massachusetts, in the wealthy Crowninshield family with long-standing ties to the sea. The family estate, Crowninshield House, was built by his father in 1870. His father was Benjamin Williams Crowninshield (1837‚Äì1892) and mother was Katherine May Bradlee (1844‚Äì1902). His younger brother Francis Boardman Crowninshield (1869‚Äì1950), married heiress Louise Evelina du Pont (1877‚Äì1958). Through his paternal grandmother Sarah Gool Putnam (1810‚Äì1880), he was distant cousin of architect J. Pickering Putnam (1847‚Äì1917). His great-grandfather Benjamin Williams Crowninshield (1772‚Äì1851) had served as Secretary of the Navy, and his great-granduncle George Crowninshield Jr. (1766‚Äì1817) built the first luxury yacht in the United States, Cleopatra's Barge in 1816. His cousin once removed was Frederick Josiah Bradlee, Jr. (1892‚Äì1970) whose son was Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee (1921-2014). Because of his many relations, he was known as \\"B.B.\\" Crowninshield. He attended Prince School in Boston and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1885, but transferred to Harvard University, where he graduated in 1890. Career Sloop Independence, 1901 After graduating from Harvard, he speculated in real estate before signing on as a draftsman with John R. Purdon, a respected yacht designer in Boston with several knockabout designs to his credit. Crowninshield struck out on his own 18 months later, starting a yacht design and brokerage firm which quickly prospered. He would rise to become one of America's most respected yacht designers during a period which is now regarded as the golden age of American wooden yacht design. He designed the schooner Adventuress, which was launched in 1913 and has been named a National Historic Landmark. Crowninshield is now best remembered for his working schooners and his America's Cup contender Independence (George Lawley & Son shipyard, 1901) for Thomas W. Lawson. He was also responsible for designing the iconic Dark Harbor 12 1/2 and 17 1/2 sloops. He served as president and general manager of Crowninshield Shipbuilding Company of Fall River, Massachusetts from 1917 to 1926. The shipyard built the \\"Six-Bitters\\" CG-130 through CG-139 for the United States Coast Guard (CG-133 would later serve as USS YP-45 during World War II). He designed the unique seven masted schooner Thomas W. Lawson, named for his patron. Personal life He married Priscilla Janet McPhail (1869‚Äì1915) on May 12, 1900. In 1902, he was fined and was sued for $10,000 for assaulting Adolphus G. McVey, the yachting editor of the Boston Herald, for a remark about his wife. After nine years, he was ordered to pay $448.

He had financial acumen and understood the infrastructure requirements needed to service rapidly increasing trade and population.\\" In December 1874 he resigned the Lands and Mines Department portfolio, to concentrate on private business. In 1894, some newspaper editors accused him of a conflict of interest because of his dual roles as minister and leading business investor. He chose to resign his commission as minister. His action was met with surprise, with \\"some seeing it as consistent with his integrity\\". Personal life and death He married Anna Mary Gibbons in 1870, with whom he would have three sons and six daughters. One of his daughters married Arthur Abbott, who was also a member of parliament.

When his brother moved to OFK Kikinda, where he made most of his career, Zdravko signed with FK Proleter Zrenjanin who were desperately fighting for the return to the Yugoslav First League. Next year he went for trials in the giants Red Star Belgrade making a good impression with the coach Gojko Zec and signing a contract with them.

He also was excellent in taking the ball forward, making a double- pass and becoming a threat to the adversaries goals, showing that he never forgot his forward skills. He was also a terrific header. It was, non- officially, said that, since Red Star had already too many players in the national team squad, he would not have a chance to play for the Yugoslav national team.

First senate term He was elected to the Nigerian Senate for the Bayelsa West constituency in 2007 and was appointed to committees on Sports, Public Accounts, Police Affairs, Niger Delta and Millennium Development Goals. After Nigeria performed poorly at the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana, the Senate Sports Committee of which Lokpobiri was chairman issued a report which cast blame on maladministration and lack of cooperation from the Director General of the National Sports Commission, Dr. Amos Adamu. Lokpobiri was chairman of the Senate Ad-hoc Committee on Transport. In June 2009, after further sabotage of oil facilities by militants in the Niger Delta, he praised the Federal Government's amnesty, saying \\"With the current amnesty deal, I believe that both parties will go home satisfactory and the contractors will henceforth work in more stable environment and that will accelerate the pace of road construction in the region.\\" In July 2009, the Senate passed the National Agency for Elderly Persons bill, sponsored by Lokpobiri, which will give legal support, welfare and recreational facilities to elderly people in the country. In September 2009, the authorities of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) and the Federal Executive Council (FEC) announced approval of new land charges in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. Senator Lokpobiri initiated a stormy debate when he accused the authorities of acting illegally by failing to first secure the approval of the National Council of States. Second senate term Lokpobiri ran for reelection as Bayelsa West Senator in the April 2011 elections, on the PDP platform, and was initially declared the winner. However, the Independent National Electoral Commission then withdrew their decision, declaring that the election was fraught with ‚Äúwidespread irregularities‚Äù. A few minutes after the announcement, Lokpobiri was arrested by State Security Service operatives. Lokpobiri challenged the INEC decision. The INEC had planned to rerun the election in Sagbama and Ekeremor local governments on 28 April 2011, but a high court in Yenagoa issued an order restraining the INEC from conducting the election until the challenge had been resolved. Lokpobiri took his seat in the Senate on 29 May 2011 and was appointed chairman of the committee on Water Resources and a member of the committee on Solid Minerals. In August 2011, it was reported that the police were not prosecuting Lokpobiri and others suspected of electoral offenses since the INEC had to approve any such move. The INEC said that it did not have the powers to prosecute offenders. In March 2012, Lokpobiri introduced controversial legislation that would make it harder for labor unions to call a strike. A ballot would be required before industrial action could be started. Lokpobiri said, \\"This helps to achieve an affirmative consensus on union members through the instrumentality of ballot. Fairness, transparency and accountability are also given pride of place in the scheme of things.\\" Other senators disagreed. Senator Joshua Dariye said, \\"The most democratic institution in the world is organized labour, they are the only hope of the society, if we stampede them, I fear we will be calling for anarchy.

The parkway serves approximately as Cary's outer ring highway, though it does not form a complete circle like the inner ring, Maynard Road. Viewing a map of the city as a clock-face, Cary Parkway extends counterclockwise approximately from the 12 o'clock position in the north down to the 7 o'clock position in the southwest. At that point, the road departs from its circular path and heads south toward its terminus at Holly Springs Road. Route description Cary Parkway was built and widened in many stages over two decades, with one of the first stretches running from Seabrook Avenue to High Meadow Drive in south-central Cary. When it was originally built, the road was a two-lane road and was not striped. The intersection with Kildaire Farm Road were stop signs. In the mid-1980s the City of Cary expanded the highway across US 1/64 to Holly Springs Road in East Cary, creating an interchange at 64/1 and widening the part of the parkway east of Kildaire Farm Road to a four-lane divided highway. West of Kildaire Farm road, the parkway remained a two-lane undivided road up to its original western terminus at Old Apex Road (this segment was not widened to four lanes until the late 1990s). West of that intersection, a four-lane divided part in the road was constructed from scratch in the late 1980s and originally dead-ended just south of High House Road in western Cary for several years. Separately, a small unconnected stretch of Cary Parkway ran from west of Harrison Avenue to well east of Evans Road. During the second stretch of expansion, this portion of the parkway was connected to the portion ending south of High House Road (passing through a short stretch of the town of Morrisville along the way), and extended eastward to Harrison Avenue. Currently, the only portion of the parkway that remains a two-lane undivided roadway is the segment running from just east of Evans Road to just west of Harrison Avenue. Future There have been several discussions of extending the parkway. To the southeast, one plan brought the parkway from Holly Springs Road to Gorman Street in Raleigh. To the northeast, there has been talk of extending the parkway eastward from Harrison Avenue toward Trinity Road and I-40 in northeast Cary.

He represents Yobe North Constituency of Yobe State under the All Progressive Congress (APC). His tenure as a senator started since 2007 Nigeria general election. In 2019, he emerged the new Senate President of the 9th National Assembly with 79 votes cast to beat Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume with 28 votes. Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan was a lecturer with a Nigeria federal university of Maiduguri, Borno North-Eastern state and a politician and senator now the president of the Nigerian senate. He holds a bachelor's degree in Geography from the University of Maiduguri in 1984., a postgraduate diploma degree in Land Surveying from the Ahmadu Bello University, a master's degree in Remote Sensing from the Ahmadu Bello University and a Doctorate degree in Remote Sensing/GIS from Cranfield University, UK, in 1990 and 1996 respectively. Political career Elected to the House of Representatives for the northern state of Yobe in 1999, at different times Lawan chaired the House Committees on education and agriculture. Lawan was elected to the Senate in 2007. In 2008, he was a member of the National Assembly's Joint Committee on Constitution Review. In 2009, as chairman of the Senate committee on Public Accounts, Lawan initiated and sponsored the Desertification Control Commission Bill. In August 2009, Senator Lawan spoke against the proposed Kafin Zaki Dam. He stated that the Tiga Dam and Challawa Gorge Dam had already reduced water flow drastically, and the Jama'are River was now the main source of water in the Yobe River. He said the dams caused intense poverty, increased desert encroachment, migration and conflicts between arable farmers and herdsmen. Lawan ran for reelection in Yobe North Senatorial District on the ANPP platform in the 9 April 2011 elections. He won with 92,799 votes, trailed by Hassan Kafayos Hussaini of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) with 76,960 votes. Senate Presidency  2015 contest  In 2015 Lawan ran for the senate president after APC zoned the position to the north eastern Nigeria based on the party's power sharing formula among the six geo-political zones at the time. The zoning meant that only senators elected on the platform of the party (APC) from the six states in the north east could run for senate president. After consultations with critical political stakeholders and senators elect from the north east, Lawan was endorsed and presented to the national leadership of the party who anointed him as the candidate of the party for senate president. The APC zoning arrangement prevents other senators elect who are form other zones from contesting for the seat. But senator Bukola Saraki from Kwara State, north central disagreed with the party's arrangement saying all qualified candidates should be allowed to exercise their constitutional rights to run for positions of leadership of the Nigerian Senate. Saraki declared his candidacy against the party's zoning principle. On the morning of June 9, 2015 the day for the election of the senate president 51 senators of the APC gathered at the International Conference Centre waiting for a truce meeting reportedly called by the leadership of the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari with a clear objective to prevail on senator Saraki to drop his ambition and support Lawan when 57 senators mostly of the opposition PDP and a few senators of APC present conducted the election. Saraki won the election by 57 unanimous votes of the senators present during the election. Lawal was at the International Conference Centre when the election was conducted and a winner emerged. That event finally nailed his ambition for the president of the 8th senate.  2019  After meeting with the Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday, June 6, 2019, Senator Danjuma Goje stepped down for Senator Lawan from the Senate Presidency race.

The ship's hull remains in Wellington today as an important archaeological site. Built by George Old at Big Bras d'Or, Nova Scotia Inconstant was one of largest wooden ships ever built in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia and the largest ship built by Old, a shipbuilder who started with schooners before focusing mainly on brigs. The ship was sold to owners in London, England and made a voyage to Australia carrying immigrants. On a subsequent Australian voyage, she was wrecked at Wellington, New Zealand in 1851 when she put in for water and ran aground. After the ship was deemed too badly damaged to sail again, the hull was purchased by John Plimmer, an entrepreneur later known as \\"the Father of Wellington\\". The hull was converted to a prominent wharf on the Wellington waterfront where it became known as \\"Plimmer's Ark\\". Linked to the shore by a bridge the ship served as one of the first piers in Wellington with the interior serving as a warehouse and auction room. It also served as a bonded customs store, immigration pier and office for the first Wellington harbourmaster. A light mounted at the seaward side of the ship became the first harbour light in Wellington.Leigh Sutton, \\"Grant Preserving piece of city and world maritime history\\", Lottery Grants Update, Issue 46, June 1999, p. 2 The hull later became a ship chandlery and gradually became landlocked between 1857 and 1860 as the Wellington waterfront was expanded. Inconstant became surrounded by Lambton Quay, Customhouse Quay and Willis Street in a wedge shaped piece of land. The upper works were demolished in 1883 and the lower hull disappeared under the first Bank of New Zealand. In the late 1990s when a new commercial development was built on the bank site, the remains of the hull were discovered and excavated by archaeologists. The lower bilges of the ship were found, running from bow to stern. Several important early Canadian shipbuilding features were documented including the use of birch for main ship timbers some of which still bore layers of birch bark. The bow of the hull was preserved under glass and displayed with various associated artifacts in the arcade of the new development.

In addition to being a prolific writer and speaker and an adjunct professor at the D√©partement d'√©tudes litt√©raires of the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, he is full professor at and Director of the D√©partement de litt√©rature compar√©e of the University of Montreal. Academic and professional biography At the end of the 1970s, Simon Harel pursued graduate studies at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM). While working with such professors as Madeleine Gagnon, he developed a keen interest in psychoanalysis, particularly in the works of Catherine Cl√©ment, Jacques Lacan, and Ren√© Major. In 1981, after his M.A., Simon Harel moved to France with the purpose of working on his PhD at the Department of Psychoanalysis at the University of Paris VIII. However, he arrived in Vincennes a few months after the dissolution of the √âcole Freudienne de Paris. Simon Harel then obtained a Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes approfondies at the Unit√© d'enseignement et de recherche de litt√©rature fran√ßaise et compar√©e at the University Paris VII Diderot before undertaking, under the supervision of Julia Kristeva, a PhD in Humanities. His doctoral dissertation, completed in 1986, is entitled \\"L'√©criture de la psychose dans les textes de Rodez d'Antonin Artaud\\". The interest that Simon Harel has for psychoanalysis deepened during his academic studies. Although he knew the works of the French psychoanalysts (Jacques Lacan, Serge Leclaire, and Ren√© Major) very well, he was greatly interested in English psychoanalysis, particularly in the reading that the French thinkers and writers did of the theories of Melanie Klein, Wilfred Bion, and Donald Winnicott. From 1986 to 1988, Simon Harel completed, under the supervision of R√©gine Robin, a post-doctoral degree at the Department of Sociology, UQAM. He then became an independent researcher, funded by FCAR from 1988 to 1989, when he was made an Adjunct Professor at UQAM. In 1993, he was promoted to Assistant Professor and, in 1997, to a tenured position. In 2001, Simon Harel co-founded, with Pierre Ouellet, the Montr√©al site of the Centre interuniversitaire d'√©tudes sur les lettres, les arts et les traditions (ELAT). He was its director from 2001 to 2007, and its interim director from September 2008 to August 2009. During his career, Simon Harel has been the head of many research networks and scientific projects funded by various organizations. He was also the principal investigator of the project Modalit√©s du lien de confiance/Conditions of the Bonds of Confidence (2006‚Äì2008). Dr. Harel is Director of the research project Zones de tension : expressions de la conflictualit√© dans la litt√©rature qu√©b√©coise et canadienne 1981‚Äì2006/Zones of Tension: Expressions of Conflict in Canadian and Qu√©b√©cois Literatures 1981‚Äì2006 (2007‚Äì2011). A well-renowned researcher and speaker, Simon Harel has overseen 11 collaborative works and 7 special issues of periodicals. He has also published a collection of poems, 10 critical works, and more than 120 articles. Furthermore, he has given more than 250 talks and conferences, and he has organized approximately 25 conferences and major scientific events. Dr. Harel was awarded a prestigious Trudeau Fellowship Prize (2009‚Äì2012) and was named, in 2009, a member of the Royal Society of Canada. Fields of expertise Harel has been a pioneer in the field of literary studies and cultural studies. He was one of the first scholars to describe the singularity of the migratory experience in Qu√©bec, which occurs to a great extent in a minority context. He has been interested in the study of interculturality, the stranger's place in society, and the precariousness of our life spaces. Conscious of the inadequacy or limited scope of certain scholarly research (with a focus on hybridity, and identity √† la carte), he is now working on the unstable, often conflictual, forms of cultural mobility. More specifically, his work is rooted in the study of narratives, as well as in the study of verbal and social practices. Among Simon Harel's fields of expertise are the following: contemporary forms of narratives (autobiography and autofiction); multiculturalism and interculturality; contemporary Quebec literature; Qu√©bec literature of cultural communities; contemporary French literature; links between psychoanalysis and culture; cultural studies; narrative studies; intersections of psychic and geographical spaces; dialogues between architecture and literature; and anger in literature.

Kroll (born May 18, 1941) is an American businessman whose company, Kroll, Inc., is credited with founding the modern corporate investigations industry in 1972. In 2004, Kroll was sold to Marsh & McLennan Companies for $1.9 billion. In 2009, Kroll founded two successor firms, Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) and K2 Intelligence. KBRA is the first bond rating agency formed since the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. K2 Intelligence, run by Kroll's son Jeremy, continues the family's work in asset recovery, due diligence, litigation support, and a range of corporate investigations. Early life and education Jules Kroll was born to a Jewish familyNew Yorker Magazine: \\"The Secret Keeper - Jules Kroll and the world of corporate intelligence\\" By William Finnegan October 19, 2009 on May 18, 1941, in Bayside, Queens, the son of Florence Yondorf and Herman Kroll. His father ran a printing business that was subject to graft and demands for kickbacks from purchasing agents. Kroll attended Cornell University, where he was a member of Quill and Dagger, and Georgetown University Law Center. Career Business In 1968, he worked for Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in Queens before becoming an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan. When his father fell ill, Kroll took a leave of absence to run the family business, which eventually became a three-year introduction to business corruption. With this experience under his belt, in 1972 he launched J. Kroll Associates, which eventually turned into Kroll, Inc. The business involved rooting out corruption in companies that did much printing, with Kroll keeping a percentage of the savings. A deal with Marvel Comics proved so profitable to both sides that Marvel switched to paying a retainer.  Expansion  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 generated new lines of business in auditing and compliance, so Kroll opened offices in Paris, Moscow, S√£o Paulo, Tokyo, Singapore, and Manila. The firm also provided political risk and executive protection services abroad. Wep Kroll forayed into banking and warehousing and built a reputation for pursuing financial crime across international borders by tracing and recovering assets. Clients included law firms like Skadden, Arps and investment banks like Drexel Burnham Lambert (which hired Kroll in 1982 to perform due diligence on persons and companies that it was underwriting). It first helped Nokia and Motorola find $2.7 billion that had been invested with Turkey's Cem Uzan. It was also hired to recover wealth that had been plundered by dictators, including the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos and Haiti's Jean-Claude Duvalier. In 1991 the government of Kuwait hired it to trace Saddam Hussein's corporate holdings around the world, including Hachette in France. K2 Intelligence and Kroll Bond Rating Agency In June 2008, Kroll left his company and unsuccessfully tried to buy it back from MMC. In 2010 he launched Kroll Bond Rating Agency and K2 Global Consulting with his son Jeremy. In 2012, K2 Global became K2 Intelligence. Kroll Bond Rating Agency was started with capital from Jeff Keswin, Michael F. Price, Frederick R. Adler, William L. Mack, and James Robinson III; Bessemer Venture Partners, RRE Ventures, and New Markets Venture Partners also invested $24 million. K2 Intelligence has offices in New York, London, Madrid, and Bahrain.

It was one of the few western regiments that fought as part of the Army of Northern Virginia in the east; participating in most major battles conducted by Robert E. Lee. Service history The 14th Tennessee was organized and drilled at Camp Duncan near Clarksville in May 1861 by Col. William A. Forbes,Regimental Sketches Retrieved 4 October 2008 Almost immediately it received orders transferring it to the Virginia theatre where the regiment would remain for the duration of the war and served with distinction in the Army of Northern Virginia, until its final capitulation. The regiment served in James J. Archer's famed \\"Tennessee Brigade\\" assigned to A.P. Hill's Light Division. Hill's men earned a hard won reputation for making critical counterattacks preserving Confederate victories at Cedar Mountain, Second Manassas and Sharpsburg. At Manassas Col. Forbes was mortally wounded and succeeded by William McComb; who¬¥d become a Brigadier General in 1865. The 14th had fought at Seven Pines, Mechanicsville, Shepherdstown, Ox Hill, Harper's Ferry, Frazier's Farm, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. At the later the brigade seized the critical high ground of Hazel Grove, forcing the Union right wing to fold back upon its center and allowing Lee to reunite his divided forces. Gettysburg nearly destroyed both the 14th Tennessee and Archer's brigade. On the first day of battle, along Willoughby Run, the famous Union Iron Brigade turned Archer's unsupported flank. His command retreated in wild confusion. The 14th, commanded by Lt. Col. James W. Lockert, had just devastated the 2nd Wisconsin with volley fire at close range when it discovered itself alone and exposed on the right and rear. Using the protection of Herbst Woods, the 14th retired in good order. After a day's rest, Lee assigned the remnants of the brigade to Brig. Gen. Johnston Pettigrew to join Pickett's Virginia division in an attack upon the Union center. What remained of Archer's Brigade now formed the hinge joining Pettigrew's and Pickett's men. Together, they formed a battle array of more than 10,000 troops, stretching almost a mile wide. The men from Tennessee aligned on Pickett's left and went in at The Angle alongside the shattered Virginians. Long before any one reached the wall Union fire slaughtered men in droves. An eyewitness, reporting on Archer's men, wrote: \\"Every flag in the brigade excepting one was captured at or within the works of the enemy. The 1st Tennessee had 3 color-bearers shot down, the last of whom was at the works, and the flag captured. The 13th Alabama lost 3 in the same way, the last of whom was shot down at the works. The 14th Tennessee had 4 shot down, the last of whom was at the enemy's works. The 7th Tennessee lost 3 color-bearers, the last of whom was at the enemy's works, and the flag was only saved by Captain Norris tearing it away from the staff and bringing it out beneath his coat. The 5th Alabama Battalion also lost their flag at the enemy s works.\\" The 14th Tennessee Infantry was among the first units at the Union line and had many of its men captured. Losing over 58 percent of the men who entered the battle; barely 100 men reformed the regiment on the following day. Despite its losses, the 14th Tennessee and the rest of the brigade continued to serve in Heth's division of the III Corps. The regiment added additional honors to their record for service at Falling Waters, Bristoe Station, Mine Run, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, Globe Tavern, Weldon Railroad, Reame's Station, Burgess' Tavern and Hatcher's Run. It surrendered with the rest of the army at Appomattox on April 9, 1865. Of a total of almost 1,000 officers and men who served in the 14th Tennessee, only 40 remained for the surrender.

He produces secretly recorded undercover audio and video encounters in academic, governmental, and social service organizations, purporting to show abusive or illegal behavior by employees and/or representatives of those organizations. He has selectively edited videos to misrepresent the context of the conversations and the subjects' responses, creating the false impression that people said or did things they did not.Andrew Breitbart and James O'Keefe Ruined Him, and Now He Gets $100,000. Friedersdorf, Conor. The Atlantic, March 8, 2013. O‚ÄôKeefe gained national attention for his selectively edited video recordings of workers at Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) offices in 2009, his arrest and guilty plea in 2010 for entering the federal office of then-U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) under false pretenses, and the release of misleading videos of conversations with two high-ranking, now former, NPR executives in 2011. When his videos portraying ACORN workers seemingly aiding a couple in criminal planning hit the 24-hour cable news cycle, the U.S. Congress quickly voted to freeze funds for the non-profit. The national controversy resulted in the non-profit also losing most of its private funding before investigations of the videos concluded no illegal activity occurred. In March 2010, ACORN was close to bankruptcy and had to close or rename most of its offices.Acorn on Brink of Bankruptcy, Officials Say, The New York Times, March 20, 2010; accessed July 17, 2015. Shortly thereafter, the California State Attorney General's Office and the US Government Accountability Office released their related investigative reports. The Attorney General's Office found that O'Keefe had misrepresented the actions of ACORN workers in California and that the workers had not broken any laws. A preliminary probe by the GAO found that ACORN had managed its federal funds appropriately. One of the fired ACORN workers sued O'Keefe for invasion of privacy; O'Keefe issued an apology and agreed to pay $100,000 in a settlement. O'Keefe has gained support from right-wing and conservative media and interest groups. In 2009, Andrew Breitbart commissioned him for the option to publish new videos exclusively on BigGovernment.com. In June 2010, O'Keefe formed a 501(c)(3) organization, Project Veritas. Early life and education James Edward O'Keefe III was born in Bergen County, New Jersey, the elder of two children of James, a materials engineer, and Deborah O'Keefe, a physical therapist. He has a younger sister. O'Keefe grew up in Westwood, New Jersey. His home was politically \\"conservative but not rigidly so\\", according to his father. He graduated from Westwood High School, where he showed an early interest in the arts, theater and journalism. He attained Eagle Scout, the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of America. O'Keefe started at Rutgers University in 2002 and majored in philosophy. Beginning in his sophomore year, he wrote a bi-weekly opinion column for The Daily Targum, the university's student paper. He left the Targum and founded the Rutgers Centurion, a conservative student paper supported by a $500 \\"Balance in the Media\\" grant from The Leadership Institute. For his first video, he and other Centurion writers met with Rutgers dining staff to demand the banning of the cereal Lucky Charms from dining halls because of its offense to Irish Americans. O'Keefe said the leprechaun mascot presented a stereotype. He intended to have officials lose either way: to appear insensitive to an ethnic group, or to look silly by agreeing to ban Lucky Charms. They expected to be thrown out of school, but the Rutgers official was courteous, took notes, and said their concerns would be considered. Rutgers staff say the cereal was never taken off the menu. Career After graduating from Rutgers, O'Keefe worked for a year at the Leadership Institute (LI) in Arlington, Virginia, under media specialist Ben Wetmore, whom O'Keefe calls his mentor. The institute sent him to colleges to train students to start conservative independent newspapers, but, after a year LI officials asked him to leave. According to LI president and founder Morton Blackwell, O'Keefe was \\"very effective and very enthusiastic\\" but after a year he was asked to leave because officials felt his activist work threatened the group's nonprofit status by trying to influence legislation. O'Keefe has produced and distributed secretly recorded and misleadingly edited videos and audio files made during staged encounters with targeted entities or individuals.Everything We Know About the Latest James O'Keefe Video Sting, Time, Philip Elliott, October 18, 2016.

Many videos received widespread media coverage sparking significant reactions, most notably videos of ACORN which resulted in the Congress quickly freezing funds, two executive agencies canceling contracts, and several ACORN workers being fired, and videos of National Public Radio (NPR) executives which led to the resignation of CEO Vivian Schiller, shortly before Congressional funding hearings involving NPR. In January 2010, O'Keefe began a column on Breitbarts website, BigGovernment.com. Breitbart stated in an interview that he paid O'Keefe a salary for his \\"life rights\\" to gain release of O'Keefe's videos first on his website. In 2010 O'Keefe formed his a new organization, Project Veritas, whose stated mission is \\"to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical and transparent society.\\" Much of the funding for Project Veritas comes from anonymous donations through Donors Trust, a conservative, American nonprofit donor- advised fund, which according to its promotional materials, says that it will \\"keep your charitable giving private, especially gifts funding sensitive or controversial issues.\\" Prominent donors include the Trump Foundation, which, in May 2015, donated $10,000.Trump used his foundation to fund guerrilla filmmaker James O'Keefe, ThinkProgress, Josh Israel, October 20, 2016. O'Keefe is a conservative activist with mainstream conservative pro-market and anti- government views, although he has described himself as a \\"progressive radical\\", because he wants to change things, \\"not conserve them\\". He considers himself a muckraker. O'Keefe has expressed admiration for the philosophy of G. K. Chesterton and for a free press. Major activities Planned Parenthood recordings (2008) In 2006, O'Keefe met Lila Rose, founder of an anti- abortion group on the UCLA campus. They secretly recorded encounters in Planned Parenthood clinics. Rose posed as a pregnant teenager seeking advice (a 15-year-old girl impregnated by a 23-year-old male); they made two videos and released them on YouTube. In one, a clinic worker in Los Angeles tells Rose \\"that she could 'figure out a birth date that works' to avoid having PPLA notify police.\\" In 2007, O'Keefe phoned several Planned Parenthood clinics and secretly recorded the conversations. He posed as a donor, asking if his donations would be applied to needs of minority women. When told they could be, he made \\"race-motivated\\" comments. By audio recordings, workers at clinics in six other states agreed to accept his donation under similar terms. Planned Parenthood of California filed a \\"cease and desist\\" order against Lila Rose, charging that she was violating state laws against secret recordings. The order required her to remove the videos from YouTube and give all the recordings to the organization. She complied through her attorney. After O'Keefe's four audio recordings were publicized in 2008, Planned Parenthood of Ohio issued a public response, saying the worker's words were \\"a violation of any policy, and it's very upsetting.\\" The CEO said, \\"Planned Parenthood has a long history of social justice.\\" Other offices noted the wide variety of services the organization offers to low income communities. African-American leaders called for withdrawal of public financing of the organization. ACORN videos (2009) In September 2009, O'Keefe and his associate, Hannah Giles, published edited hidden camera recordings in which Giles posed as a prostitute and O'Keefe as her boyfriend, a law student, in an attempt to elicit damaging responses from employees of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), an advocacy organization for people of low and moderate income. Washington Post correspondents Darryl Fears and Carol D. Leonnig reported that O'Keefe \\"said he targeted ACORN for the same reasons that the political right does: its massive voter registration drives\\" and that \\"[p]oliticians are getting elected single-handedly due to this organization.\\" According to the Washington Post, ACORN registered people mostly from the Latino and African American groups. The videos were recorded during the summer of 2009According to the California Attorney General's investigation report, p. 8, the recordings occurred in ACORN offices in eight cities: Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, Miami, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino. and appeared to show low-level ACORN employees in six cities providing advice to Giles and O'Keefe on how to avoid detection by authorities of tax evasion, human smuggling and child prostitution. He framed the undercover recordings with a preface of him dressed in a \\"pimp\\" outfit, which he also wore in TV media interviews. This gave viewers, including the media, the impression that he had dressed that way when speaking to ACORN workers. However, he actually entered the ACORN offices in conservative street clothes (the sleeve of his dress shirt is visible on camera). Furthermore, the ACORN employees involved reported his activities to the police after he left. O'Keefe selectively edited and manipulated his recordings of ACORN employees, as well as distorted the chronologies. Several journalists and media outlets have expressed regret for not properly scrutinizing and vetting his work.David Folkenflik, \\"Elements Of NPR Gotcha Video Taken Out Of Context\\", npr.org, March 14, 2011; accessed February 24, 2015.\\"The Twisty, Bent Truth of the NPR- Sting Video\\", time.com, March 13, 2011. Reception and lawsuit After the videos were released through the fall of 2009, the U.S. Congress quickly voted to freeze federal funding to ACORN. The Census Bureau and the IRS terminated their contract relationships with ACORN. By December 2009, an external investigation of ACORN was published which cleared the organization of any illegality, while noting that its poor management practices contributed to unprofessional actions by some low-level employees. In March 2010, ACORN announced it would dissolve due to loss of funding from government and especially private sources. On March 1, 2010, the district attorney for Brooklyn at that time found there was no criminal wrongdoing by the ACORN staff in New York. In late March 2010, Clark Hoyt, then public editor for The New York Times, reviewed the videos, full transcripts and full audio. Hoyt wrote \\"The videos were heavily edited. The sequence of some conversations was changed. Some workers seemed concerned for Giles, one advising her to get legal help. In two cities, ACORN workers called the police. But the most damning words match the transcripts and the audio, and do not seem out of context.\\"Hoyt, Clark (March 20, 2010). \\"THE PUBLIC EDITOR: The Acorn Sting Revisited\\", The New York Times; retrieved January 13, 2012. The California Attorney General's Office granted O'Keefe and Giles limited immunity from prosecution in exchange for providing the full, unedited videotapes related to ACORN offices in California. The AG's Report was released on April 1, 2010, concluding that the videos from ACORN offices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino had been \\"severely edited.\\" The report found there was no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of ACORN employees nor any evidence that any employee intended to aid or abet criminal conduct. It found that three employees had tried to deflect the couple's plans, told them ACORN could not offer them help on the grounds they wanted, and otherwise dealt with them appropriately. Such context was not reflected in O'Keefe's edited tapes. The AG's Report noted that \\"O'Keefe stated that he was out to make a point and to damage ACORN and therefore did not act as a journalist objectively reporting a story\\". It found no evidence of intent by the employees to aid the couple. The report also noted \\"a serious and glaring deficit in management, governance and accountability within the ACORN organization\\" and said its conduct \\"suggests an organizational ethos at odds with the norms of American society. Empowering and serving low-and moderate-income families cannot be squared with counseling and encouraging illegal activities.\\" On the basis of the edited videotape which O'Keefe released, Vera appeared to be a willing participant in helping with O'Keefe's plan to smuggle young women into the United States illegally. However, authorities confirmed that Mr. Vera immediately contacted them about O'Keefe and that he had also encouraged O'Keefe to share as much information as possible about his scheme and gather further evidence of O'Keefe's purported illegal activities, which could then be used by prosecutors to bring charges against O'Keefe for attempted human trafficking. Due to O'Keefe's release of the dubiously edited video, intentionally designed to \\"prove\\" that ACORN employees were ready and willing to engage in illicit activities, Mr. Vera lost his job and was falsely accused of being engaged in human trafficking. O'Keefe noted that he \\"regrets any pain\\" caused by his reckless actions, though O'Keefe's lawyer dismissed any claimed injury incurred by Vera and stated that the payment was a \\"nuisance settlement\\".O'Keefe pays $100,000 to ACORN employee he smeared - conservative media yawns\\", forbes.com, March 8, 2013; accessed August 24, 2015. O'Keefe moved for summary judgment in his favor, arguing that the plaintiff had no reasonable expectation that the conversation would be private. In August 2012, the federal judge hearing the case denied O'Keefe's motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled that O'Keefe had \\"misled plaintiff to believe that the conversation would remain confidential by posing as a client seeking services from ACORN and asking whether their conversation was confidential.\\" On March 5, 2013, O'Keefe agreed to pay $100,000 to former California ACORN employee Juan Carlos Vera for breaking state law prohibiting surreptitious recording, and acknowledged in the settlement that at the time he published his video he was unaware that Vera had notified the police about the incident. The settlement contained the following apology: \\"O'Keefe regrets any pain suffered by Mr. Vera or his family.\\" On June 14, 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) published its report finding no evidence that ACORN, or any of its related organizations, had mishandled any of the $40 million in federal money which they had received in recent years. Senator Mary Landrieu (2010) O'Keefe and colleagues were arrested in the Hale Boggs Federal Complex in New Orleans in January 2010 and charged with entering federal property under false pretenses with the intent of committing a felony, at the office of United States Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat. His three fellow activists, who were dressed as telephone repairmen when apprehended, included Robert Flanagan, the son of William Flanagan, acting U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Louisiana.\\"James O'Keefe charged in alleged phone tampering of Senator Mary Landrieu's office\\", The Washington Post, January 27, 2011. The four men were charged with malicious intent to damage the phone system. O'Keefe stated that he had entered Landrieu's office to investigate complaints that she was ignoring phone calls from constituents during the debate over President Barack Obama's health care bill. The charges in the case were reduced from a felony to a single misdemeanor count of entering a federal building under false pretenses. O'Keefe and the others pleaded guilty on May 26. O'Keefe was sentenced to three years' probation, 100 hours of community service and a $1,500 fine. The other three men received lesser sentences. In August 2013, O'Keefe revisited the incident by releasing a video entitled: \\"a confrontation with former U.S. Attorney Jim Letten on the campus of Tulane University\\". Letten is a former Republican U.S. Attorney who recused himself from the Landrieu incident because he knew the father of one of the men involved. The video shows Letten accusing O'Keefe of \\"terrorizing\\" Letten's wife at their home, of harassing him, and trespassing on the Tulane campus. He called O'Keefe a \\"coward\\" and a \\"spud\\", and referred to O'Keefe and his companions as \\"hobbits\\" and \\"scum\\". NPR video (2011) On March 8, 2011, shortly before the US Congress was to vote on funding for National Public Radio (NPR), O'Keefe released a video of a discussion with Ronald Schiller, NPR's senior vice president for fundraising, and associate Betsy Liley. Raw content was secretly recorded by O'Keefe's partners Ken Larrey and Shaughn Adeleye. In the videos published by O'Keefe, the NPR executives were shown meeting with representatives of a self-described Muslim charity called the \\"Muslim Education Action Center\\" that wished to donate money to NPR. At the meeting, the representatives claimed their charity was affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. NPR responded by stating that Schiller's remarks were presented out of sequence and that he said that he would speak personally, and not for NPR. Schiller said some highly placed Republicans believed the Republican Party had been hijacked by a radical group (the Tea Party) that they characterized as \\"Islamophobic\\" and \\"seriously racist, racist people\\", and while Schiller did not disagree, according to NPR, O'Keefe's editing made it appear those were Schiller's opinions. Schiller then says that unlike establishment Republicans, the growing Tea Party movement in the party \\"is fanatically involved in people's personal lives and very fundamental Christian ‚Äî I wouldn't even call it Christian. It's this weird evangelical kind of move.\\"NPR: O'Keefe 'Inappropriately Edited' Video; Exec's Words Still 'Egregious'\\"; NPR; Mark Memmott; March 14, 2011.Elements Of NPR Gotcha Video Taken Out Of Context; NPR; David Folkenflik; March 14, 2011. Later in the edited video, Schiller seems to say he believes NPR \\"would be better off in the long run without federal funding\\", explaining that removal of federal funding would allow NPR more independence and remove the widely held misconception that NPR is significantly funded by the public. But on the raw tape, Schiller also said that withdrawing federal funding would cause local stations to go under and that NPR is doing \\"everything we can\\" to keep it. In a statement released before analysis of the longer raw video, NPR said, \\"Schiller's comments are in direct conflict with NPR's official position ... The fraudulent organization represented in this video repeatedly pressed us to accept a $5 million check with no strings attached, which we repeatedly refused to accept.\\" After reviewing the unedited video, Scott Baker, editor- in-chief of TheBlaze, said the NPR executives \\"seem to be fairly balanced people.\\" Journalists Ben Smith, James Poniewozik, and Dave Weigel have expressed regret for giving O'Keefe's NPR videos wider circulation without scrutinizing them for themselves. Reception Comparison of the raw video with the released one revealed editing that was characterized as \\"selective\\" and \\"deceptive\\" by Michael Gerson, opinion writer in The Washington Post, who wrote, \\"O'Keefe did not merely leave a false impression; he manufactured an elaborate, alluring lie.\\" Time magazine wrote that the video \\"transposed remarks from a different part of the meeting\\", was \\"manipulative\\" and \\"a partisan hit-job.\\" The raw video shows Schiller told the two men \\"that donors cannot expect to influence news coverage.\\" On the longer tape, he says, \\"There is such a big firewall between funding and reporting: Reporters will not be swayed in any way, shape or form.\\" The broadcast journalist Al Tompkins, who now teaches at the Poynter Institute, noted that Ron Schiller was a fundraiser, not an official affecting the newsroom. He commented on the raw tape: \\"The message that he said most often‚ÄîI counted six times: He told these two people that he had never met before that you cannot buy coverage\\", Tompkins said. \\"He says it over and over and over again.\\" On March 17, Martha T. Moore of USA Today reported: \\"According to The Blaze analysis, Ron Schiller's most inflammatory remarks, that Tea Party members are 'seriously racist', were made as he was recounting the views of Republicans he has spoken with‚Äîalthough he does not appear to disagree. It also shows Schiller appearing to laugh about the potential spread of Islamic sharia law, when the longer version shows he laughed in reaction to something completely different.\\" Two days later, O'Keefe released a video in which Betsy Liley, senior director of institutional giving at NPR, appeared to have checked with senior management and said MEAC was cleared to make donations anonymously and NPR could help shield donations from government audits, but added that, in order to proceed, additional background information would be required, including an IRS Form 990. Liley advised the caller that NPR executives would investigate them before accepting any large donation, examining tax records and checking out other organizations that have received donations from them. Liley raises the possibility of NPR's turning down substantial gifts and stresses the \\"firewall\\" between the revenue-generating part of NPR and its news operation. NPR put Liley on administrative leave. In emails released following the publication of the Liley video, NPR confirmed that the official had consulted appropriately with top management and notified the purported donors of problems with their desired method of donation.Dave Weigel, \\"NPR Publishes E-Mails From Top Staff Stating Problems With \\"Muslim Group's\\" Offer of $5 Million\\", Slate.com, August 8, 2011.

U.S. Presidential elections (2016) A month before the launch of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, the Trump Foundation donated $10,000 to O'Keefe's Project Veritas. O'Keefe attended, as a guest of the Trump campaign, the final presidential debate, and was later available in the spin room following the Las Vegas event.Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Trump's claim tying violence at his rallies to the Clinton campaign; The Washington Post, October 21, 2016; \\"Further, the Trump Foundation gave $10,000 to Project Veritas in 2015.

Americans United for Change videos On October 18, 2016, O'Keefe released a series of videos on Project Veritas' YouTube channel titled \\"Rigging the Election\\" that apparently showed former national field director Scott Foval of Americans United for Change discussing planting agitators, including \\"mentally ill people that we pay to do shit\\" in front of Donald Trump rallies to ask questions near reporters, a common practice known as \\"bird dogging\\".James O'Keefe's New Story About the 47 Percent Video is Totally False; Mother Jones; David Corn; October 27, 2016. Foval also said \\"We've been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin' assholes for fifty years and we're not going to stop now.\\" Foval later said he was talking about busing people to rallies. Foval went on to discuss the legal consequences of voter fraud: \\"Let's just say, in theory, if a major investigation came up of major vote fraud that way, how would they prove it? ... If there's a bus involved, that changes the dynamic ... You can prove conspiracy if there's a bus, but if there are cars, it is much harder to prove.\\" The accuracy of the videos has been questioned for possibly omitting context, and the unedited raw footage has not been made available.Steve Eder and Jonathan Martinoct, Videos Put Democrats on Defensive About Dirty Tricks; The New York Times, October 20, 2016. DNC Chair Donna Brazile said the video footage omitted necessary context. Scott Foval was fired by Americans United for Change after the first video was released. Foval later said he had been set up. Robert Creamer a DNC consultant and husband of U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky, D-IL, said, \\"We regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a regional contractor for our firm, and he is no longer working with us,\\" he said. \\"While none of the schemes described in the conversations ever took place, these conversations do not at all reflect the values of Democracy Partners.\\" Shortly afterwards, Creamer, who was also featured in the video, said he would end his consulting arrangement with the DNC to avoid becoming a \\"distraction\\". Following the publication of his videos, O'Keefe filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and the DNC, alleging \\"a criminal conspiracy\\" involving the Clinton campaign, the DNC and three left-leaning super PACs.Mark Hensch, \\"O'Keefe files FEC complaint against Clinton camp, DNC\\", The Hill, October 21, 2016. On June 1, 2017, Creamer's firm, Democracy Partners, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Project Veritas, claiming Project Veritas had lied to gain access to the firm and violating anti-wiretapping laws. In response to a third video, in which O'Keefe stated that Clinton was behind an illegal public relations gimmick to punish Trump for not releasing his tax returns, the Clinton campaign denied any wrongdoing. Independent campaign finance experts posited the video doesn't support O'Keefe's claims. Clinton said she was aware of the activists dressed as Donald Duck, who were following Donald Trump while asking about his tax returns, and said she was amused. On October 26, 2016, O'Keefe posted a fourth video on his Project Veritas Action YouTube channel. The video alleged that liberal groups supporting Hillary Clinton were illegally taking foreign money. The targeted group, Americans United for Change foundation, is a 501(c)4 organization and is allowed to legally accept foreign contributions. However, AUC returned the money shortly after the video was released. The group's chief stated, \\"We returned the money because the last thing we want to be associated with is a character like O'Keefe who has been convicted and successfully sued for his illegal tactics and fraudulent activities.\\" On November 8, 2016 (Election Day), O'Keefe spent some time going around vans that were allegedly \\"bussing people around to polls in Philadelphia\\". On January 9, 2017, Project Veritas operative Allison Maass was filmed attempting to bribe members of Americans Take Action into inciting a riot at Trump's inauguration. On January 16, 2017, Project Veritas uploaded a video showing DC Antifascist Coalition members of Disrupt J20 plotting to use \\"stink bombs\\" at the DeploraBall. After the video's release, Disrupt J20 denied the statements, saying that the members deliberately gave false information to Veritas. The video led to the arrest of one man allegedly involved in the plan, as well as two associates. All three individuals pleaded guilty. New York City elections official video In October 2016, Project Veritas released a video taken at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party on December 16, 2015. It was secretly recorded by an undercover journalist posing as a political consultant. In the video, the Democratic representative from Manhattan on the New York City Board of Elections, Commissioner Alan Schulkin, was seen saying that there was \\"all kinds of fraud\\" in the election system. Schulkin criticized Mayor Bill de Blasio's municipal ID program as a major contributing factor. \\"He gave out ID cards, de Blasio. That's in lieu of a driver's license, but you can use it for anything. But they didn't vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say, 'I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card.' It's absurd. There is a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud ... This is why I get more conservative as I get older\\", Schulkin said in the tape. Not realizing he was being recorded, Schulkin said, \\"The law says you can't ask for anything. Which they really should be able to do. I think there is a lot of voter fraud.\\" He continued, \\"Certain neighborhoods in particular, they bus people around to vote. They put them in a bus and go poll site to poll site.\\" At another point in the conversation, Schulkin said, \\"Oh, there's thousands of absentee ballots. ... I don't know where they came from.\\" Shortly after the release of the video, Mayor de Blasio called Schulkin's behavior \\"entirely inappropriate\\" and demanded his resignation. At a subsequent BOE meeting in October, Schulkin said his remarks had been taken out of context and denied being a racist, but defended his support for a voter ID law. He was told by party leaders at the meeting that he would not be reappointed to another four-year term after his term expired on December 31. Other activities Abbie Boudreau (2010) In August 2010, O'Keefe planned a staged encounter with CNN correspondent Abbie Boudreau, who was working on a documentary on the young conservative movement. He set up an appointment at his office in Maryland to discuss a video shoot. Izzy Santa, executive director of Project Veritas, warned Boudreau that O'Keefe was planning to \\"punk\\" her on the boat by trying to seduce her--which he would film on hidden cameras. Boudreau did not board the boat and soon left the area. CNN later published a 13-page plan written by O'Keefe mentor Ben Wetmore. It listed props for the boat scheme, including pornography, sexual aids, condoms, a blindfold and \\"fuzzy\\" handcuffs. When questioned by CNN, O'Keefe denied he was going to follow the Wetmore plan, as he found parts of it inappropriate. Boudreau commented \\"that does not appear to be true, according to a series of emails we obtained from Izzy Santa, who says the e-mails reveal James' true intentions.\\" Following the Boudreau incident, Project Veritas paid Izzy Santa a five-figure settlement after she threatened to sue, which included a nondisclosure agreement. Kenneth P. Vogel, \\"James O'Keefe's plans derailed by infighting, lack of funding\\", Politico.com, November 17, 2011; accessed December 24, 2011. Funding decreased from conservative political organizations following this CNN incident. New Jersey Teachers' Union video (2010) Starting October 25, 2010, O'Keefe posted a series of videos on the Internet entitled Teachers Unions Gone Wild. At the time, the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) was in negotiations with Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, over teacher pay benefits and tenure. O'Keefe obtained one video from recordings made by \\"citizen journalists\\", whom he recruited to attend the NJEA's leadership conference. They secretly recorded meetings and conversations with teacher participants. It featured teachers discussing the difficulty of firing a tenured teacher. A second video featured a staged phone conversation by O'Keefe with Lawrence E. Everett, assistant superintendent of the Passaic, New Jersey city schools, in which Everett refused to commit to firing a teacher based upon the purported claim by a parent that the teacher had used the \\"n-word\\" with his child. The third video (October 26, 2010) featured audio of a voice, identified as NJEA Associate Director Wayne Dibofsky, who alleged voter fraud during the 1997 Jersey City mayoral election. The voice of Robert Byrne, Jersey City municipal clerk, was recorded on the same video; he noted that the election was monitored by lawyers for both candidates. New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris Christie stated at the time that nothing on the videos surprised him.\\"Hidden video by conservative activist James O'Keefe renews NJEA, Gov. Christie dispute\\", nj.com; accessed February 24, 2015. NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer said the union and its attorneys were discussing their options regarding possible legal action, although no action was ever taken. Wollmer called the videos \\"a calculated attack on this organization and its members\\", and described O'Keefe as \\"flat-out sleazy\\". Medicaid videos (2011) In the summer of 2011, O'Keefe released videos of his colleagues' staged encounters purportedly showing Medicaid fraud in offices in six states, including Maine, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, and Virginia. Following his previous strategy, he sent the releases to conservative outlets over a period of weeks. In July 2011, two conservative groups released a secretly recorded video of an encounter in Maine's Department of Health and Human Services. In the video, an actor attempted to apply for benefits while hinting that he was a drug smuggler. Americans for Prosperity and O'Keefe said he had similar recorded videos from offices in Ohio, Virginia and South Carolina, and believed that there was a systemic problem. In Maine, Governor Paul LePage concluded upon further examination of the videos that there was no fraud or intent to commit fraud.Rebekah Metzler,\\"'Sting' Video Stirs Fraud Debate\\", Portland Press Herald, August 12, 2011; accessed September 15, 2011.Ken Christian. \\"Undercover video hints at potential for welfare fraud\\", wcsh6.com, August 11, 2011. Quote by Gov. Paul LePage regarding the video: \\"The video in its entirety does not show a person willfully helping someone defraud the welfare system.\\" A similar O'Keefe video posted on the Project Veritas web site purported to show workers at the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services assisting actors posing as drug dealers in applying for benefits. His fourth Medicaid video, apparently filmed in Richmond, Virginia, was released in July 2011. The New York Times reported: \\"[As 'Sean Murphy'], dressed in the same regalia he wore on the New Jersey shoot, [O'Keefe] presented himself to a Medicaid worker in Charleston, S.C., as an Irish drug importer and Irish Republican Army member who wanted coverage for 25 wounded comrades who entered the U.S. illegally. The kindly worker spent time photocopying applications and dealing with this improbable applicant.\\" She explained to him that only U.S. citizens are eligible for Medicaid and informed him she was not making any promises that the 25 purported IRA members would qualify. She said he had to abide by the law and told him that she didn't want to know details, because federal law protects patient privacy. \\"Like I said, someone would have to come here and subpoena our information in order for us to divulge any information, because like I said there's something called the Health Insurance Accountability and Affordability Act‚Äîor portability‚Äîand anyway it went into effect several years ago, and that's what we follow. It is federal law, and they do threaten high fines‚Äîwhich they don't pay me as much per year as they threaten to fine me‚Äîso it is definitely not in my own best interest to divulge anything to anyone because I cannot afford it, I do not want to go to jail.\\"Ryan J. Reilly, James O'Keefe's Latest 'Terrorist' Medicaid Sting Goes After Woman For Following Law, talkingpointsmemo.com, July 20, 2011. Reception The videos received less media attention than earlier O'Keefe efforts. Generally, the state officials and representatives acknowledged potential problems but also took a measured tone in response, to allow time to fully investigate and evaluate the incidents. After viewing the video, Governor LePage thanked the individual who took the video and noted: \\"The video in its entirety does not show a person willfully helping someone de-fraud the welfare system. It does show a need for further job knowledge and continuous and improved staff training.\\" He also stated that \\"we would be six months further along in fixing the problem\\" if he had received the video when it was filmed. LePage directed his agency director to work on correcting the problem. Ohio media initially reported that \\"a Franklin County Jobs and Family Service worker was placed on administrative leave and at least one other person was out of work\\" as a result of the video's release. Ben Johnson of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services noted that benefits were never granted in the case, and that the made-up story would have been caught if the application process had proceeded. He said his office would use the video to strengthen staff training. Mike DeWine, Attorney General of Ohio, described the Ohio video as \\"outrageous\\" and intended to instruct his state's Medicaid fraud unit to look into the incident.Johnson quote: \\"Assuming (the video is) accurate, it's unacceptable ... The video is incredibly troubling. I'm less concerned with the filmmakers and what their motivations might have been, and more concerned with making sure we're spending taxpayer money appropriately, that we're rooting out fraud, wherever it is, and that we're running a clean program. The end result of this is we're going to take this video and we're going to use it as a training video.\\" The director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, Michael Colbert, notified county leaders of a mandatory retraining, \\"to ensure they can identify people trying to defraud the government\\". Upon investigation by state officials, the Medicaid worker who coached O'Keefe's operative seeking Medicaid for his father and claimed to own a yacht as well as a helipad, on how to hide their (also claimed) ownership of an $800,000 automobile had been placed on paid administrative leave.Chafets, Zev. \\"Stinger: James O'Keefe's Greatest Hits\\", The New York Times, July 27, 2011; accessed August 3, 2011. \\"O'Keefe grew up in Westwood, N.J., and still lives with his parents.\\" A spokesman for Virginia governor Bob McDonnell said that he had asked state police to review the video and take whatever actions are appropriate. In Charleston, South Carolina, the director of that state's Department of Health and Human Services, Anthony Kreck, said the video filmed in his state \\"raises concerns about how well trained and supported our staff are to handle outrageous situations.\\" He also expressed concern for the safety of the state employee with the figure [\\"Sean Murphy\\"] in the video \\"who could be interpreted as intimidating\\" and questioned why security wasn't called. New Hampshire primary video (2012) In January 2012, O'Keefe released a video of associates obtaining a number of ballots for the New Hampshire Primary by using the names of recently deceased voters. He stated that the video showed \\"the integrity of the elections process is severely comprised .\\" His team culled names from published obituaries, which were checked against public voter roll information. O'Keefe said his team broke no laws, as they did not pretend to be the deceased persons when they asked for the ballots, and they did not cast votes after receiving ballots. One of his associates' attempts was caught by a voting supervisor at the polling station who recognized that the name he gave was of a deceased individual; the associate in question left before police arrived.\\"Fraudulent voter stopped in New Hampshire\\", Boston Herald, January 11, 2012. Reception Sarah Parnass of ABC News reported that the video \\"either exposes why voting laws are too lax or comes close to itself being voter fraud (or both)\\". One media account referred to it as a stunt. New Hampshire Governor John Lynch said, \\"I think it is outrageous that we have out-of-staters coming into New Hampshire, coming into our polling places and misrepresenting themselves to the election officials, and I hope that they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, if in fact they're found guilty of some criminal act.\\" The New Hampshire Attorney General and the US Attorney's Office announced investigations into the video.\\"Group Says It Got Primary Ballots With Dead People's Names; Governor Says Group's Actions Should Be Investigated\\", WMUR.com, January 12, 2012.

Head announced he would investigate the possibility that the filmmakers committed crimes while producing the videos. Hamline University law professor David Schultz said, \\"If they [O'Keefe's group] were intentionally going in and trying to fraudulently obtain a ballot, they violated the law\\", referring to Title 42, which prohibits procuring ballots fraudulently. The New Hampshire Attorney General's office later dropped its investigation of O'Keefe for potential voter fraud in 2013. Patrick Moran (2012) On October 24, 2012, a video was released showing Patrick Moran, son of then-U.S. Congressman Jim Moran (D-VA), and a field director with his father's campaign, discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots, which was proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign. The person he was speaking with was a conservative activist with O'Keefe's Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation. Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he did not want to be a distraction during the election, stating: > [A]t no point have I, or will I ever endorse any sort of illegal or > unethical behavior. At no point did I take this person seriously. He struck > me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him. > In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that > there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of > illegal behavior, joking or not. The Arlington County, Virginia Police Department was made aware of the video and opened a criminal investigation into \\"every component\\" of the matter.Arlington Police Looking Into 'Every Component' of Moran Video, arlington-va.patch.com, October 25, 2012. On January 31, 2013, Arlington County announced that the investigation, by its police department in collaboration with the Offices of the Virginia Attorney General and the Arlington County Commonwealth's Attorney, had concluded and that no charges would be brought. The County stated: \\"Patrick Moran and the Jim Moran for Congress campaign provided full cooperation throughout the investigation. Despite repeated attempts to involve the party responsible for producing the video, they failed to provide any assistance.\\" US‚ÄìMexico border-crossing (2014) In August 2014, O'Keefe dressed up as Osama bin Laden (who had died 3 years previously) and crossed the US‚ÄìMexico border in Texas in both directions to \\"show that our elected officials were lying to the American people\\" about border security. The incident was cited by U.S. Senator John McCain in Congressional hearings. Attempt to solicit voter fraud (2014) In October 2014, O'Keefe and his two colleagues attempted to bait staffers for Congressman Jared Polis (D-CO) and then-U.S. Senator Mark Udall, as well as independent expenditure organizations, into approving voter fraud, according to several staffers who interacted with O'Keefe and his colleagues. Staffers began photographing O'Keefe's crew and advising them that what they were advocating was illegal; one nonprofit said they contacted police.\\"Colorado Dems: We Caught James O'Keefe and His Friends Trying to Bait Us Into Approving Voter Fraud\\", motherjones.com, October 20, 2014; accessed February 24, 2015. Attempted sting of Open Society Foundations (2016) On March 16, 2016, O'Keefe attempted to call Open Society Foundations under the assumed name of \\"Victor Kesh\\", describing himself as attached to \\"a, uh, foundation\\" seeking to \\"get involved with you and aid what you do in fighting for, um, European values.\\" O'Keefe forgot to hang up after recording the voicemail, and several more minutes of audio were recorded, revealing that he was attached to Discover the Networks and planning a series of attempts to create embarrassing videos or other recordings of targeted groups. CNN undercover videos (2017) On June 26, 2017, O'Keefe released a video on Project Veritas' YouTube channel that showed John Bonifield, a producer of health and medical stories for CNN, saying that CNN's coverage of the Russian investigation was for \\"ratings\\" and that the coverage was \\"mostly bullshit\\". The video identified Bonifield as a supervising producer of CNN, but did not state that he was a supervising producer for CNN Health. In a statement, CNN stated: \\"CNN stands by our medical producer John Bonifield. Diversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN strong, we welcome it and embrace it.\\" During a White House press briefing, deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders encouraged people to watch the video \\"whether it's accurate or not\\". On June 28, 2017, O'Keefe released the second part of the series of undercover videos, by then dubbed \\"American Pravda\\". In the video, CNN anchor Van Jones said, \\"The Russia thing is just a big nothingburger.\\" When asked about the video in an email, CNN responded \\"lol\\". During that same day, the videos were posted on Donald Trump's Instagram account. Jones said that O'Keefe had deceptively edited the video to take his remarks out of context and was attempting to \\"pull off a hoax.\\" Jones added that he believed that there probably was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. On June 30, 2017, O'Keefe released the third part of the undercover videos. Part 3 of the series showed CNN associate producer Jimmy Carr saying that Trump is \\"fucking crazy\\" and that \\"on the inside, we all recognize he is a clown, that he is hilariously unqualified for this, he's really bad at this, and that he does not have America's best interests\\". Carr also said \\"This is a man who's not actually a Republican, he just adopted that because that was the party he thought he could win in. He doesn't believe anything that these people believe.\\" Additionally, he said American voters are \\"stupid as shit.\\" He also made comments about Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway, calling her an \\"awful woman\\" and stating that she \\"looks like she got hit with a shovel\\". In a fourth video published by Project Veritas on July 5, Carr criticized CNN co-anchor Chris Cuomo.  Failed attempt to sting The Washington Post (2017)  Starting in July 2017, Project Veritas operative Jaime Phillips attempted to infiltrate The Washington Post and other media outlets by joining networking groups related to journalism and left-leaning politics. She and a male companion attended events related to the Post, and their conversations with journalists were sometimes covertly recorded. In November 2017, The Washington Post reported that several women accused Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of pursuing them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Later that same month, Jaime Phillips approached The Washington Post and falsely claimed that Moore had impregnated her as a teenager and that she had an abortion.Matthew Haag, Woman Tried to Dupe Washington Post With False Claim About Roy Moore, Paper Says, New York Times (November 27, 2017). In conducting its usual fact-checking, the Post discovered multiple red flags in her story. They found a GoFundMe page in her name that said, \\"I've accepted a job to work in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceipt of the liberal MSM.\\" After a Post reporter confronted her with the inconsistencies during a video-recorded interview, Phillips denied that she was working with an organization that targets journalists, and said that she no longer wanted to do the story. She was seen outside Project Veritas' office in Mamaroneck, New York, with her car remaining at the office's parking lot for more than an hour. O'Keefe declined to comment about the woman's apparent connection to Project Veritas. Instead of running a story about Phillips' supposed pregnancy, the Post published an article about the attempted sting operation. The Post decided to disclose Phillips' original discussions made off the record, saying they were not obligated to keep them confidential because she had deceived them. Hours after the Post published this story, O'Keefe released a video which he claimed exposed the newspaper's liberal bias. The video includes undercover footage of conversations with two Post employees, national security reporter Dan Lamothe and product director Joey Marburger. These employees explained to undercover Project Veritas operatives the difference between the news reporting of the Washington Post (which calls out the Trump administration's missteps while giving \\"him credit where there's credit\\" due) and the Post's opinion editorials; O'Keefe said that this exposed the Washington Post's \\"hidden agenda.\\" O'Keefe was criticized for his failed sting, and The Washington Post was praised. Rod Dreher of The American Conservative praised the Post and called on conservative donors to stop giving money to O'Keefe's outfit. Dan McLaughlin of the conservative National Review said that O'Keefe's sting was an \\"own goal\\" and that O'Keefe was doing a disservice to the conservative movement; Jim Geraghty of the National Review made a similar assessment. Byron York of The Washington Examiner said that O'Keefe's \\"idiocy\\" was \\"beyond boneheaded,\\" and that \\"O'Keefe really ought to hang it up.\\" Ben Shapiro, the conservative editor in chief of The Daily Wire, said that the botched sting was \\"horrible, both morally and effectively.\\" Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic wrote, \\"If James O'Keefe respected the right-wing populists who make up the audience of Project Veritas ... he would tell them the truth about all of the organizations that he targets. Instead, Project Veritas operates in bad faith, an attribute it demonstrated again this week in the aftermath of its bungled attempt to trick The Washington Post.\\" Noah Rothman of the conservative magazine Commentary chastised O'Keefe for being exploitative of his audience: \\"No longer are institutions like Veritas dedicated to combating ignorance in their audience. They're actively courting it.\\" Jonathan Chait of New York magazine said that O'Keefe, having set out prove that the Post was fake news, ended up disproving it. O'Keefe's plot collapsed because it was premised on a ludicrously false worldview, wrote Chait. \\"The Washington Post does not, in fact, publish unverified accusations just because they're against Republicans.\\" O'Keefe's attempts to prove rampant voter fraud have failed \\"because voter fraud is not rampant.\\"  New Jersey Teachers Unions Officials (2018)  On May 2, 2018, Project Veritas posted on YouTube a video allegedly showing a New Jersey teachers union administrator discussing a teacher alleged to have struck a student. The teacher was suspended following the release of the video, pending an investigation. The following day, O'Keefe released a second video allegedly showing another New Jersey teachers union administrator speaking to students about a different alleged incident of a teacher pushing and injuring a student. In the video, the administrator allegedly boasted of her effort to retain a pension for a teacher who allegedly had sex with a student. She was also suspended pending an investigation. On May 5, the New Jersey State Senate announced their intention to convene a joint committee to investigate the incidents. Reception Project Veritas uses methods not employed by reputable journalists, including misrepresenting its operatives' identities. O'Keefe refers to himself as a \\"guerrilla journalist\\". Such methods have stirred debate about what it means to be a journalist and what constitutes good journalistic practice, especially with respect to undercover work. Tim Kenneally and Daniel Frankel reported for thewrap.com on March 9, 2011, that some of O'Keefe's supporters referred to him as the right wing's answer to a long line of left-leaning \\"hybrid troublemakers who get put on the cover of Rolling Stone, like Paul Krassner and Abbie Hoffman\\".Tim Kenneally & Daniel Frankel \\"James O'Keefe, NPR-Slayer, What Kind of Journalist is This?\\", thewrap.com, March 9, 2011. In that same March 2011 report, Marty Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, was quoted as saying: > What [O'Keefe] does isn't journalism. It's agitpop, politi-punking, > entrapment-entertainment. There is no responsible definition of journalism > that includes what he does or how he does it. His success at luring his prey > into harming themselves is a measure of how fallible and foolish anyone, > including good people, can sometimes be. In reporting on allegations that O'Keefe had attempted in 2010 to tamper with Senator Landrieu's office phone system, Jim Rutenberg and Campbell Robertson of the New York Times posited that O'Keefe practiced a kind of \\"gonzo journalism\\" and his tactic is to \\"caricature the political and social values of his enemies by carrying them to outlandish extremes.\\" Jonathan Seidl of TheBlaze said of the first NPR video, \\"the video, in the end, not only raises questions about NPR, but it also raises questions about undercover, gotcha journalism that can sometimes border on entrapment.\\"Jonathan Seidl,\\"Undercover: NPR Exec Talks 'Racist' Tea Party and 'Anti-Intellectual' GOP, But Is He Kowtowing to Muslim Brotherhood?\\", theblaze.com, March 8, 2011; accessed September 16, 2011. Scott Baker of TheBlaze wrote in March 2011 about the NPR videos, saying that O'Keefe was \\"unethical\\" because he calls himself an \\"investigative journalist\\" but \\"uses editing tactics that seem designed to intentionally lie or mislead about the material being presented.\\" In a March 2011 interview with O'Keefe, NPR journalist Bob Garfield asked, referring to the ACORN videos, \\"If your journalistic technique is the lie, why should we believe anything you have to say?\\" O'Keefe responded that his techniques should be characterized as a form of guerrilla theater rather than \\"lying\\" ‚Äì \\"you're posing as something you're not, in order to capture candid conversations from your subject. But I wouldn't characterize it as, as lying.\\" In July 2011, Dean Mills, the dean of the Missouri School of Journalism, compared O'Keefe to Michael Moore and said, \\"Some ethicists say it is never right for a journalist to deceive for any reason, but there are wrongs in the world that will never be exposed without some kind of subterfuge.\\" The Atlantic journalist Conor Friedersdorf responded that O'Keefe's \\"mortal sin\\" wasn't that he misled his subjects, but that he misled his audience by presenting his videos to the public in \\"less than honest ways that go far beyond normal 'selectivity.'\\"Friedersdorf, Conor. \\"What the NYT Magazine Doesn't Say About James O'Keefe\\", The Atlantic, July 29, 2011.

In Bangladesh, a village is the smallest territorial and social unit for administrative and representative purposes. It is an elective unit of a Union Council from which a single council member is elected. Usually one village is designated as a ward and each union is made up of nine villages. At the 1991 census, there were 68,038 villages in Bangladesh with an average of 232 households. The rural areas of Bangladesh (i.e. villages) are characterized by higher growth rate of population and lower literacy rate compared to urban areas - but these gaps are decreasing. After independence the villages in Bangladesh were underdeveloped in terms of infrastructure and economic activity. Traditional manual process driven agriculture used to be the predominant economic activity. However, the ingenuity and vitality demonstrated by the people is gradually driving the villages towards economic progress.

Even the evidence from the 3rd-century Buddhist tantra text Mahamayuri (which uses Kabusha for Kapisha) and the Ramayana- manjri by Sanskrit Acharya, Kshemendra of Kashmir (11th century AD), which specifically equates Kapisa with Kamboja, thus substituting the former with the latter, therefore, sufficiently attest that Kapisa and Kamboja are equivalent.See: Indian Antiquaries, 52, part 2, 1923 .Pre Aryan and Pre Dravidian in India, 1993 edition, p 121, Dr Sylvain L√©vi, Dr Jules Bloch, Dr Jean Przyluski, Asian Educational Services.

Majumdar, Dr A. D. Pusalkar, Dr. K. M. Munshi. Scholars like Dr Moti Chandra, Dr Krishna Chandra Mishra etc. also write that the Karpasika (of Mahabharata)Mahabhara 2.48.7. and Kapisa (Ki-pin/Ka-pin/Chi-pin of the Chinese writings) are synonymous terms.Geographical and Economic Studies in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata: UpƒÅyana Parva, 1945, p 44, Dr Moti Chandra - India; Tribes in the Mahabharata: A Socio-cultural Study, 1987, pp 94, 314, Krishna Chandra Mishra - MahƒÅbhƒÅrata. Thus, both Karpasika and Kapisa are essentially equivalent to Sanskrit Kamboja.Dr Moti Chandra writes: \\"Thus before us is placed a suggestion that Kapis- Kamboja denoted the same geographical unit. To this may also be added Karpasika which on account of its rare appearance seems to be clinging to some original form phonetically very near to the Sanskritised form Karpasika when more common form as Kapisa and Kamboja were being commonly used\\" (See: Geographical and Economic Studies in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata: UpƒÅyana Parva, 1945, P 44, Dr Moti Chandra. And PƒÅ·πáinian term Kapi≈õi is believed to have been the capital of ancient Kamboja.A Comparative Study of Thirty City- state Cultures: An Investigation, 2000, p 388, Dr Hansen, Mogens Herman (ed(d). Kapisa (Ki-pin, Ke-pin, Ka-pin, Chi-pin of the Chinese records), in fact, refers to the Kamboja kingdom, located on the south-eastern side of the Hindukush in the Paropamisadae region. It was anciently inhabited by the A≈õvakayana (Greek: Assakenoi), and the A≈õvayana (Greek Aspasio) (q.v.) sub- tribes of the Kambojas. Epic Mahabharata refers to two Kamboja settlements: one called Kamboja, adjacent to the Daradas (of Gilgit), extending from Kafiristan to south-east Kashmir including Rajauri/Poonch districts,The History and Culture of the Indian People, 1977, p 15, Dr Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Dr Achut Dattatraya Pusalker, Dr Asoke Kumar Majumdar; An Advanced History of India, 1973, p 54, Dr Rame·π£a-Chandra Majumdar; The Soul of India, 1961, p 56, Amaury De Riencourt.Mahabharata 7.4.5; Mahabharata II.27.23. while the original Kamboja, known as Parama Kamboja was located north of Hindukush in Transoxiana territory mainly in Badakshan and Pamirs/Allai valley, as neighbors to the Rishikas in the Scythian land.Mahabharata II.27.25; Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India: Their Religion and ..., 1874, p 365, Dr John Muir - 1874; Die Voelker des oestlichen Asien: Studien und Reisen, 1865, p 186, Adolf Bastian; The Problems of Ancient India, 2000, p 1-8, K.

Even Ptolemy refers to two Kamboja territories/and or ethnics - viz.: (1) Tambyzoi, located north of Hindukush on Oxus in Bactria/Badakshan and (2) Ambautai located on southern side of Hindukush in Paropamisadae. Even the Komoi clan of Ptolemy, inhabiting towards Sogdiana mountainous regions, north of Bactria, is believed by scholars to represent the Kamboja people.Central Asiatic provinces of the Maurya Empire, p 403, Dr H.C. Seth; See also: Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol XIII, 1937, p 400-403; cf: History and Archaeology of India's Contacts with other Countries, from Earliest Times to 300 B.C., 1976, p 152, Shashi Asthana. For Kamboja Nomads in Central Asia, Cf also: India and Central Asia, p 25, Dr P. C. Bagchi. Scholars like S. Levi and Michael Witzel accept the identity of Tambyzoi and Ambautai with Sanskrit Kamboja. The Ptolemian Ambautai formed parts of the Kapisa kingdom under sway of A≈õvakayana/A≈õvayana (A≈õvaka) Kambojas. It appears probable that the original home of the Kambojas was trans-Oxian Kamboja, from where, some tribal sections moved south-wards and planted colonies in Paropamisan on southern side of Hindukush. With passage of time, the Paropamisan settlements came to be addressed as Kamboja proper, whereas the original Kamboja settlement lying north of Hindukush, in Transoxiana, became known as 'Parama-Kamboja' i.e. furthest Kamboja.See: Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India: Their Religion and ..., 1874, p 365, Prof John Muir; Geographical Data in the Early PurƒÅ·πáas: A Critical Study, 1972, p 167-68, Dr M. R. Singh. Some scholars call Parama Kamboja as 'Uttara-Kamboja' i.e. northern KambojaSee: Development of Hindu Polity and Political Theories, 1927, p 227, Narayanchandra Banerjee. or Distant Kamboja.Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1930, p 117. The Kapisa-Kamboja equivalence also applies to the Paropamisan Kamboja settlement. Physical characteristics of the people of Kapi≈õa Hiuen Tsang says that \\"the people of Kapi≈õa (Kai-pi-chi(h)) are cruel and fierce; their language is coarse and rude. Their marriage ceremonies are mere intermingling of sexes.The area that is commonly called Greater Punjab had comprised, in ancient times, vast territories of northern India and eastern Pakistan. In its original sense, it encompassed territories from Swat/Kabul to Delhi including Sarayu (Herat River), Gomal, Kurrum, Swat and Indus, besides the five rivers of modern Punjab and extending as far as river Yamuna in the east(See refs: Aryan and non-Aryan Names in Vedic India, Data for the linguistic situation, c. 1900-500 B.C., p 17; Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan, (Rgvedic, Middle and Late Vedic), p 6, Dr Michael Witzel, Harvard University). In ancient times, the area was inhabited by people called the Vahikas or Arattas. Scholars say that \\"Aratta\\" is a popular (prakrit) form of Vedic \\"A-rashtra\\" ‚Äì which means without king or government. This compares to Avestic \\"A-sara\\" ‚Äì also meaning without head/or government--- thus the Vedic Aratta is said to allude to A-rashtra i.e. kingless or headless or in other words, a republican people or territory (See refs: The Ancient Geography of India, 1871, p 215, Alexander Cunningham; Evolution of Heroic Tradition in ancient Panjab, 1971, p 53, Dr Buddha Prakash; The Age of Imperial Unity, History and Culture of Indian People, p 49, Ed Dr R. C. Majumdar, Dr A. D. Pusalkar; Hindu Civilization, 1923, p 289, Dr Radhakumud Mookerji; The Generalship of Alexander the Great, 2004, p 255, J. F. C. Fuller; The Cambridge Ancient History, 1923, p 406, John Bagnell Bury, Stanley Arthur Cook, Frank Ezra Adcock, Martin Percival Charlesworth, Norman Hepburn Baynes, Charles Theodore Seltman). Similarly, the term \\"Vahikas\\" denoted \\"those falling outside the pale of Aryandom\\" or \\"those who are outside the pale of virtue, and live away from the Himavat, Ganga and Sarsvati...\\" (See refs: Ethnology of Ancient BhƒÅrata, 1970, p 113, Ram Chandra Jain; A Grammatical Dictionary of Sanskrit (Vedic), 1953, p 52, Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala, Surya Kanta, Jacob Wackernagel, Arthur Anthony Macdonell, Peggy Melcher; Tribes in Ancient India, 1943, p 71, Dr B. C. Law - Ethnology). The tribes of the \\"Aratta\\" or \\"Vahika\\" territories were of wayward nature, committed highway robberies, and followed autonomous or republic way of life. And they were definitely outside the pale of Vedic Aryans. It was on account of these above characteristics of this people that they came to be commonly styled as Arattas or Vahikas etc. Aratta or Vahika, by no means, implies an ethic termThe Vahikas or Arattas were divided into many tribes or clans like the Gandharas, Prasthalas, Khasas, Vasatis, Trigartas, Pauravas, Malavas, Yaudheyas, Saindhavas, Sauviras; the Iranian and transfrontier peoples such as the Kambojas, Pahlavas; and the Persianised Ionians (Yavanas) as well as the nomadic Scythians, also called Shakas (See: Evolution of Heroic Tradition in Ancient Panjab, 1971, p 53, Dr Buddha Parkash; Cf also: The History of Indian Literature, 1878, p 178, Albrecht Weber - Sanskrit literature).The cis- Hindukush Kambojas (i.e south of the Hindukush), had extended from the Paropamisadae territory to as far as south-west of Kashmir (i.e. north-west Punjab). They had formed parts of the Aratta or Vahika people as described in the Karanaparava of Mahabharata. Much of the physical characteristics as described by Hiuen Tsang of the people of Kapisa to Rajapura (Rajauri), match very well with those which the Karanaparava of Mahabharata spells for the people of Aratta/Vahika countries which region included the Madras, Gandharas, Kambojas etc, and where the rules of intermingling of sexes are also described as much relaxed and libralised (See: Social Structure of Warrior Communities, Chapter VI of \\"Evolution of Heroic Traditions in Ancient Punjab\\", 1971, pp 52-60, Dr Buddha Prakash).Cf: D. D. Kosambi observes: \\"The caste observances were so slack in the frontiers that the Brahmanical literature began to look upon the Madra, Gandhara and Kamboja peoples as loose-lived and barbaric. As compared to the rigid four-class social system of Madhyadesa, these tribes of the frontiers followed two social classes and further there was permissible vertical mobility.... The women were treated equal to men and there was no taboo of social mixing among the two sexes. Both sexes ate meat, drank strong liquor and there would be mixed public dancing in a state of undress. Such way of life was positively obscene to the eastern Brahmin eyes. The custom of bride price among the Madras (instead of dowry) appeared degrading to the easterners. Nevertheless, the beauty, the loving nature and utter fidelity of the women of the north-west including Madra, Bahlika remained proverbial (e.g: Immortal Love Legend of Savitri & Satyavan. Savitri was the daughter of Asvapati, king of Madra tribe). A warrior's widow in these regions would even immolate herself with her husband's corpse. The horrifying custom of Sati was completely unknown in the east until as late as 6th century AD....\\" (See ref: Mobile Men: Limits to Social Change in Urban Punjab - 1976, p 3, Satish Saberwal; The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline, p 119, D. D. Kosambi.See also the Mahabharata Link on the Madra peoples of the Vahika/Aratta country for general characteristics of Vahika society: . Their literature is like that of Tukhara country but the customs, the common language, and rule of behavior are somewhat different. For clothing they use hair garments (wool); their garments are trimmed with furs. In commerce, they use gold and silver coins and also little copper coins.Ancient references like Mahabharata, Ramayana etc profusely attest that the Kambojas produced and made use of woolen, fur and skin clothes and shawls, all embroidered with gold. Ancient Kambojas were noted for their horses, gold, woolen blankets, furry clothing etc (Foundations of Indian Culture, 1990, p 20, Dr Govind Chandra Pande - Spiritualism (Philosophy); Hindu World, Volume I, 1968, p 520, Benjamin Walker etc. Hiuen Tsang further writes that the king of Kapisa is Kshatriya by caste.The Kambojas are also labelled as Kshatriyas in numerous of ancient texts of India. See Link: Kambojas#Kambojas as Kshatriyas (warriors) He is of shrewd character (nature) and being brave and determined, he has brought into subjection the neighboring countries, some ten of which he rules \\".Si-Yu-KI V1: Buddhist Records of the Western World, Edition 2006, p 54-55, Hiuen Tsiang. According to scholars, much of the description of the people from Kapi≈õa to Rajapura as given by Hiuen Tsang agrees well with the characteristics of the Kambojas described in the Buddhist text, Bhuridatta JatakaJataka 548; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1912, p 255-57. as well in the great Indian epic Mahabharata.Mahabharata 12.207.43-44; Mahabharata 6.11.63-64.Journal, 1920, p 78, University of Calcutta, Deptt. of Letters; Journal of the Department of Letters, 1923, p 78, University of Calcutta; Political History of Ancient India, 1996, p 134, Dr H.

Moreover, the Drona Parava of Mahabharata specifically attests that Rajapuram was a metropolitan city of the epic Kambojas.Karna-Rajapuram-gatva-Kambojah- nirjitastava (MBH 7.4.5). The Rajapuram (=Rajapura) of Mahabharata (Ho-b-she- pu-lo of Hiuen Tsang) has been identified with modern Rajauri in south-western Kashmir.For Rajapura=Holo-she-pulo, See: Yuan Chwang, Vol I, p 284, Watters; Si-yu-ki: Buddhist Records of the Western World, 1906, p 163, Samuel Beal - Travelers, Chinese; History of Kanauj to the Moslem Conquest, 1964, p 84, Rama Shankar Tripathi; Some K·π£atriya Tribes of Ancient India, 1924, p 236, Dr B.

Culturally speaking, Kapi≈õa had significant Iranian influence.Indian Historical Quarterly, 1963, p 103. The early Shahis of Kapi≈õa/Kabul The affinities of the earlier Shahi rulers (the so-called Turk Shahi) of Kapisa/Kabul, who are believed to have probably ruled from the early 5th century till 870 AD, are still not clear. The different scholars link their affinities to different ethnics. 11th-century Muslim histriographer Alberuni's confused accounts on the early history of ShahisSee: Tarikh-al-Hind, trans. E. C. Sachau, 1888/1910, vol ii, pp 10-14, Abu Rihan Alberuni.The Pathans, 1958, p 108, 109, Olaf Caroe.Cf: \\"That the first dynasty of Kabul was Turki is plainly based on the vulgar tradition which Alberuni himself remarked was clearly absurd. The Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang knew well enough what a Turk was since he had come to Kabul through their country..... Against the contemporary evidence of Hiuen Tsang, an absurd tradition related by Alberuni after 400 years and with evident reluctance and disbelief in it cannot, therefore, be taken for history.....Hiuen Tsang clearly addresses the ruler of Kapisa/Kabul, whom he had personally met, as devout Buddhist and a Kshatriya and not a Tu-kiue/Tu- kue (Turk)\\" (Ref: History of Mediaeval Hindu India, 1979, p 200, Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya). based mainly as they are on folklore, do not inspire much confidence on the precise identity of the early Shahis of Kapisa/Kabul. They call them as Hindus on the one hand and claim their descent from the Turks, while at the same time, they also claim their origin/descent from Tibet.NOTE: Nepali Traditions apply name Kamboja Desha to Tibet (See: √âtude sur l'Iconographie bouddhique de l'Inde, pp 134-135, A. Foucher). It is also supported by two manuscripts [No 7768 & 7777] described in the Catalogue of Sanskrit and Prakrit Mss in the library of India Office Vol II, Part II\\" (Refs: History of Bebgal, I, 191, Dr R. C. Majumdar; Dist Gazeteer [Rajashahi], 1915, p 26; Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal, Dr B. C. Sen, p 342, fn 1. According to scholars, the ancient Kambojas are known to have extended as far as up to little Tibet i.e. Bolor or Baltistan (See Refs: Peter weiss: Von existentialistischen Drama zum marxistischen Welttheater ..., 1971, Otto F. Best; The Devi Bhagavatam, Vol. 2 of 3, p 117, Swami Vijnanannanda; Historical MahƒÅkƒÅvyas in Sanskrit, Eleventh to Fifteenth Century A.D., 1976, 373, Chandra Prabha; KƒÅmar≈´pa≈õƒÅsanƒÅvalƒ´, Assam, 1981, p 137, Dimbeswar Sarma, P. D. Chowdhury, R. K. Deva Sarma). When viewed from Nepala itself, the ancient Kambojas appeared as if extended up to main Tibet, and this is stated to have been the logic behind the Nepalese traditions which identify Tibet with the Kamboja.Alberuni's accounts also connect the early Shahis to a king Kanika (Kanishaka?) but at the same time, make some Barahatigin to be the founder of the dynasty which is claimed to have ruled for 60 generations i.e. about 1200-1500 years at a stretch which fact alone is sufficient to lose one's confidence in the folklore accounts of Alberunis!!. King Kanika is shown as some intermediate king down the line in this dynasty. Dr V. A. Smith calls the early Shahis as a Cadet Branch of the Kushanas. H. M. Elliot identifies them with Kators/Katirs and further link them to Kushans. George Scott Robertson writes that the Kators/Katirs of Kafiristan belong to the well known Siyaposh tribal group of the Kams, Kamoz and Kamtoz tribes.The K√°firs of the Hindu-Kush, 1896, pp 71-77, George Scott Robertson - Nuristani (Asian people).And numerous scholars now also agree that the Siyaposh tribes of Hindukush are the modern representatives of the ancient Kambojas. Charles Fredrick Oldham identifies them with Naga-worshiping Takkas or Kathas and groups the Naga-cum-Sun worshipping Urasass (Hazaras), Abhisaras, Gandharas, Kambojas and Daradas collectively as the representatives of the Takkas or Kathas. Dr D. B. Pandey traces the affinities of the early Kabul Shahis to the Hunas. Bishan Singh and K. S. Dardi etc. connect the Kabul Shahis to the ancient Kshatriya clans of the Kambojas/Gandharas. 7th-century Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang, who visited INdis (629 AD - 645 AD) calls the ruler of Kapisa as Buddhist and of a Kshatriya caste.Si-Yu-KI V1: Buddhist Records of the Western World, Edition 2006, p 54-55, Hiuen Tsiang; The Sun and the Serpent: A Contribution to the History of Serpent-worship, 1905, p 120, Charles Frederick Oldham - Serpent worship; The Shahis of Afghanistan and the Punjab, 1973, p 17, Deena Bandhu Pandey; The History and Culture of the Indian People, 1977, p 165, Dr Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Dr A. D. Pusalkar - India. Kalhana, the 12th-century Kashmirian historian and author of the famous Rajatarangini, also calls the Shahis of Gandhara/Waihind as Kshatriyas. :Adyapi dyotate sahevahvayena digantare, :Tatsantana bhavonantah samuhah Ksatrajanamanam |:(Kalahana's Rajatrangini, New Delhi, 1960, VIII, 3230, M. A. Stein (Editor). These early references link this Kshatriya ruler and his dynasty undoubtedly to the Indo-Iranian Aryan lineage. Further, though Kalhana takes the history of the Shahis to as early as or even earlier than 730 century AD, but he does not refer to any supplanting of the Shahi dynasty at any time in the entire history of the Shahis.Kalahana's Rajatrangini, New Delhi, 1960, VIII, 3230, M. A. Stein (Editor; Studies in the Geography of Ancient and Medieval India, 1971, p 291, Dr D. C. Sircar; Hindu Sahis of Afghanistan and the Punjab, 1972, p 5, Yogendra Mishra. It is also worth mentioning here that the ancient Indian sources like PƒÅ·πáini's Astadhyayi,Ashtadhyayi Sutra 4.1.168-175. Harivamsa,Harivamsa, 14.19-20. Vayu Purana,Vayu Purana, 88.127-43. Manusmriti,Manusmirity X.43-44. Mahabharata,Mahabharata 13.33.20-21). Cf also: (Mahabharata 13.35.17-18. Kautiliya's Arthashastra :Sanskrit: :Kamboja.Suraastra.Ksatriya.shreny.aadayovartasastra.upajiivinah:Licchivika.Vrjika.Mallaka.Madraka.Kukura.Kuru.Panchala.adayo raaja.shabda.upajiivinah|::(Kautiliya Arathashastra, 11.1.03). etc. etc. call the Kambojas and the Gandharas as Kshatriyas. According to Olaf Caroe, the earlier Kabul Shahis, in some sense, were the inheritors of the Kushana- Hephthalite chancery tradition and had brought in more Hinduised form with time. There does not yet exist in the upper Kabul valley any documentary evidence or any identifiable coinage which can establish the exact affinities of these early Shahis who ruled there during the first two Islamic centuries.The Pathans, 1958, p 101, Olaf Caroe. Obviously, the affinities of the early Shahis of Kapisa/Kabul are still speculative, and the inheritance of the Kushan-Hephthalite chancery tradition and political institutions by Kabul Shahis do not necessarily connect them to the preceding dynasty i.e. the Kushanas or Hephthalites. From the 5th century to about 794 AD, their capital was Kapisa, the ancient home of the cis-Hindukush Kambojas ‚Äì popularly also known as Ashvakas. After the Arab Moslems began raiding the Shahi kingdom, the Shahi ruler of Kapisa moved their capital to Kabul (until 870 AD). Alberuni's accounts further claim that the last king of the early Shahiya dynasty was king Lagaturman (Katorman) who was overthrown and imprisoned by his Brahmin vizier called Kallar. Alberuni's reference to the Brahman vizier as having taken over the control of the Shahi dynasty, in fact, may be a reference to Kallar (and his successors) as having been followers of Brahmanical religion in contrast to Shahi Katorman (Lagaturman) or his predecessors Shahi rulers, who were undoubtedly staunch Buddhists.Cf also: H. M. Elliot, History of India as told by its own Historians, Ed J. Dawson, p 426; S. D. Singh Charak, PURB No 1, 1970, p 2ff. It is very likely that a change in religion may have been confused with change in dynasty. In any case, this started the line of so- called Hindu Shahi rulers, according to Alberuni's accounts. See the main article: Shahi It was part of Delhi Sultanate, Khalji dynasty in particular. Modern ethnics of Kapi≈õa Scholars have identified the former Kafir clans of the Kams, Kamoje/Kamoz, Kamtoz etc. (or modern Nuristanis) as the relics of the Kapi≈õas i.e. Kambojas of the Paropamisan region. Similarly, the former Kafir-like Aspins of Chitral and Ashkuns or Yashkuns of Gilgit are identified as the modern representatives of the PƒÅ·πáinian A≈õvakayanas (Greek: Assakenoi) and the Asip/Isap or Yusufzai (from Aspazai) in the Kabul valley (between river Kabul and Indus) are believed to be modern representatives of the PƒÅ·πáinian A≈õvayanas (Greek: Aspasioi) respectively.The Quarterly Review, 1873, p 537, William Gifford, George Walter Prothero, John Gibson Lockhart, John Murray, Whitwell Elwin, John Taylor Coleridge, Rowland Edmund Prothero Ernle, William Macpherson, William Smith.An Inquiry Into the Ethnography of Afghanistan, 1893, p 75, Henry Walter Bellew.Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1864, p 681, by Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.The Invasion of India by Alexander the Great as Described by Arrian, Q.

W. McCrindle). Sir Thomas H. Holdich, in his classic book, (The Gates of India, p 102-03), writes that the Aspasians (Aspasioi) represent the modern Kafirs. But the modern Kafirs, especially the Siah-Posh Kafirs (Kamoz/Camoje, Kamtoz) etc are considered to be modern representatives of the ancient Kambojas.

This is especially due to the high production rates of the influential commercial Tamil films from Tamil Nadu, India and the long run ethnic civil war in Sri Lanka. Tamils contributed significantly to Sinhala cinema as well as Indian Tamil cinema, also known as Kollywood. Only a few Tamil language films were produced in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Earlier Tamil movies produced were all most destroyed or unrecovered due to civil war. Producers and directors * S. M. Nayagam, a Sri-Lankan Tamil of Indian origin, was the first producer of a Sinhala film Kadawunu Poronduwa (roughly translated as \\"Broken Promise\\"), which was produced in 1947. Since production and technical facilities were unavailable in Sri Lanka at the time all production work was completed in Madurai, South India. He went on to produce many other Sinhala films -- Mathalang, Ahankara Istree -- and was the pioneer of Sinhala cinema. * K. Gunaratnam was one of the most successful producers of early Sri Lankan cinema. With the popular and influential Sujatha Gunaratnam brought his Cinemas Ltd. company into original productions in 1953. Previously he had dubbed several Indian films into Sinhala. Over the span of the decade, Gunaratnam had hit after hit with such works as Warada Kageda?, Radala Piliruwa and Saradam.

Anandan gained accolades with his camera work for Sri Lankan films like Golu Hadawatha and Nidhanaya. As a director he produced sophisticated commercial movies that were hugely popular in their time. * T. Somesekeran directed and produced the Sinhala movie Seda Sulang, one of the most popular Sri Lankan films of the 1950s. It helped secure the star status of Sinhala actors Prem Jayanth and Florida Jayalath. * Robin Tampoe was one of the most prolific early Sri Lankan directors, handling the reins on such works as Sudo Sudu (1965). He worked in genres including village folk drama, comedy and romance. Tampoe produced all of his films and had his own studio, R. T. * W. M. S.

Venkat directed several Sinhala films in the 1960s and 1970s such as Siripathula (1978). He was burned alive in his car during 1983 riots. * Thangarajah Arjuna was a graduate of the London School of Film Technique and a presidential award winning filmmaker in Sri Lanka.

The son of a schoolmaster, Maurice was educated at the Wesleyan seminary at Bristol before entering University College, Oxford in 1774, aged 19 (B.A. 1778, M.A. 1808); he was chaplain to the 87th regiment (about 1784), Vicar of Wormleighton, Warwickshire (1798‚Äì1824) and Cudham, Kent (1804‚Äì24). Maurice was a noted oriental scholar and historian, and assistant-keeper of MSS at the British Museum (1798‚Äì24).http://198.82.142.160/spenser/authorrecord.php?action=GET&recordid;=33264 Life Maurice, an English divine and scholar, noted particularly for his studies of the antiquities of India, was born about 1755 at Hertford, where his father was then head-master of the Christ's Hospital school. After his father's death the family was impoverished by an unfortunate marriage of the widow, and his education proceeded irregularly till Dr. Parr, on opening his school at Stanmore, was prevailed on to receive him as a pupil, and treated him with great generosity and kindness. Destined for the Church, he entered at nineteen St. John's College, Oxford, whence he removed next year to University College. After taking his degree of B.A., he was ordained by bishop Lowth, and held for some time the curacy of the large parish of Woodford, in Essex, which in 1785 he resigned for a chapel at Epping, in order to obtain greater leisure for study. His turn for historical studies had been fostered at University College by his distinguished tutor Lord Stowell, and he now began to concentrate his attention on the history of India, for treating upon which he made proposals in 1790 in a published letter addressed to the East India directors. The irreligious spirit of the French Revolution, alarming Maurice's mind, induced him to remodel his first work after it was nearly completed, and to devote a considerable proportion of it to dissertations on the Hindu mythology. In 1791 he came before the public with two volumes of his Indian Antiquities: the rest were brought out at intervals, the completion of the work being mainly owing to the liberality of the earl of Harborough; and the seventh and last volume appeared in 1797. This work remains to our day a trustworthy book of reference. Meantime he had undertaken a History of Hindostan, the three volumes of which, in quarto, were published in 1795, 1798, 1799, and a second edition appeared in 1821. In 1798 earl Spencer presented him to the vicarage of Wormleighton, in Warwickshire; next year he was appointed assistant librarian in the British Museum; in 1800 bishop Tomline obtained for him the pension that had been held by the poet Cowper; and in 1804 he received from the lord chancellor the vicarage of Cudham, in Kent. His Modern History of Hindostan, in two volumes, appeared in 1802 and 1804. Several other volumes on Eastern history and theology, and attempts in verse, succeeded this work; and one of his last undertakings was his Memoirs, comprehending the History of the Progress of Indian Literature, and Anecdotes of Literary Characters in Britain, during a Period of Thirty Years. Of this work the three volumes appeared in 1819, 1820, and 1822. He died March 30, 1824. See English Cyclop. s.v.; Allibone, Dict. of Brit. and Amer. Authors, s.v.; Gorton, Biog. Dict. s.v.

The lyrics by Pete Brown are mentioned in Brown's autobiography \\"White Rooms and Imaginary Westerns\\" () as being in reference to Bruce's erstwhile bandmates Dick Heckstall-Smith and Graham Bond of The Graham Bond Organisation.http://quavid.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/famous-bus-spotters/ The following year, \\"Theme\\" appeared on Mountain's Climbing! album. Mountain bassist/vocalist Felix Pappalardi, who sang the song with Mountain, had helped produce Bruce's album and brought the song to guitarist/vocalist Leslie West's attention for their album. Mountain performed the song at the Woodstock Festival in 1969; this version appeared on the Woodstock 2 album. In 1988, Bruce teamed up with Mountain guitarist Leslie West, and performed the song again on West's Theme album, which was named after the song.

He was the best friend of Albert Ball. Military career Foot was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the infantry on 27 October 1914, and was promoted to lieutenant in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry on 28 December 1914. He was transferred from the OBLI to the General List and appointed a flying officer (observer) in the Royal Flying Corps on 21 October 1915. On 20 December 1915 he was granted Aviators' Certificate No. 2257 after flying a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military Flying School at Farnborough, and was appointed a flying officer on 10 February 1916. Foot was assigned to No. 11 Squadron RFC, where he befriended Ball. On 23 July 1916 he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. Between 9 September and 15 September 1916, flying Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2b No. 7016, Foot destroyed three enemy aircraft. The day after his third win, he transferred to No. 60 Squadron. There was a SPAD S.VII on trial with the unit; Foot used it to destroy an Albatros two-seater on 28 September. He then used a Nieuport 17 to drive down a Roland C.II on 21 October 1916. On 26 October, Foot was shot down in flames by German ace Hans Imelmann; somehow, Foot crash-landed unscathed. On 3 November, he was sent back to England for a rest.Shores et.al. (1990), p.157. Shortly afterwards his award of the Military Cross was gazetted. He joined No. 56 Squadron on 10 March 1917, as it mobilized as the first squadron to operate the Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5. Once again, he was a flight commander. However, an auto accident the night before the squadron departed for France knocked Foot out of flying for the remainder of the war. However, he continued to serve, being promoted to temporary major on 30 April 1918, and was an instructor at the No. 1 School of Special Flying based at RAF Gosport. Finally, on 11 April 1919, Foot was transferred to the RAF's unemployed list, bringing his military career to an end. Postwar career G-EAVP, the Bristol M.1 in which Foot was killed After leaving the Royal Air Force Foot joined the Handley Page Transport company as a commercial pilot flying the London to Paris passenger route, finally leaving the company in April 1923 to take a position with the Bristol Aeroplane Company as a test pilot and instructor with their flying school operated on behalf of the Royal Air Force Reserve. On 21 April 1923 Foot was granted a commission as a probationary flying officer (Class \\"A\\") in the General Duties Branch of the RAF Reserve. Foot was also a noted competitor in the popular air races of the day. In July 1921 he took part in the Sixth Aerial Derby, organised by the Royal Aero Club, flying a circuit around London twice, in a Martinsyde F.4 fitted with a 300 hp Hispano-Suiza engine. Unfortunately engine problems caused his retirement during the first lap. In September 1921 he led the \\"White Team\\" in a relay team event for the Air League Challenge Cup, as part of the first Aviation Race Meeting held by the Royal Aero Club at Croydon Aerodrome. Again mechanical problems meant that his team had to withdraw. In June 1922, at the Third Croydon Aviation Race Meeting, Foot took 3rd place in the First Sprint Handicap flying the Martinsyde F.4. A year later, in June 1923, Foot was entered into the first Grosvenor Challenge Cup. He was sponsored by Sir George Stanley White, the Managing Director of the Bristol Company, and flew the Bristol M.1D monoplane, registered G-EAVP, fitted with a 100 hp Bristol Lucifer engine. The race took place in stages, beginning at Lympne, Kent, with stops at Croydon, Birmingham, and Bristol, before returning to Croydon, and ending at Lympne. When Foot landed at Filton Aerodrome, Bristol, his aircraft had developed a fuel leak, and Foot appeared affected by petrol fumes. However, after repairs he set off again, but his aircraft crashed on the Stonehill Road between Chertsey and Chobham, and burst into flames. Foot was killed instantly. He had been married only a few months before. Honours and awards ;Military Cross :Temporary Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Ernest Leslie Foot, General List and R.F.C. :For conspicuous skill and gallantry. When flying a single-seater scout, he dived on to five hostile machines, which were flying at about 2,500 feet, and drove one to the ground as a wreck. On many other occasions he has shown great determination when fighting enemy machines.

The ornate and well-preserved Queen Anne Victorian house was built in 1906. Musician and school teacher Dorothy Bembridge lived in the house from 1918 until she was murdered there in 1999. The house was acquired by Long Beach Heritage in 2000. Description Bembridge House, located at 953 Park Circle Drive, Long Beach, California, is a Queen Anne Victorian house that was built in 1906. It has 18 rooms, and has been preserved with its original high ceilings, woodwork, and many of the original furnishings. It is considered the most ornate Victorian residence in Long Beach with hand-carved woodwork, stained and leaded glass, and a tiled fireplace. In 1981, the Los Angeles Times described the house as follows: \\"It is the city's only perfectly preserved Queen Anne mansion, an intricate arrangement of turrets, pillars, angles, beveled Tiffany glass windows, and white-on-blue scrollwork reminiscent of Wedgwood.\\" Long Beach Heritage calls Bembridge House \\"the single most important example of this style of architecture remaining in Long Beach today\\", and notes that it is considered by many to be \\"the most significant residential historic landmark structure\\" in Long Beach. History The house was built in 1906 by Stephen and Josephine Green. He was one of the founders of City National Bank, a wealthy businessman who came to Long Beach from Seattle and Los Angeles. Green planted exotic shrubs and flowers around the house and also built an aviary for his collection of foreign birds and a barn where he kept Shetland ponies. Green was reportedly an unpopular man who had legal disputes with his neighbors. He reportedly suffered \\"a stroke of apoplexy\\" and died at the house after an encounter with a neighbor. His funeral was held at the house. Thomas Rankin purchased the house in 1918 following Green's death. The house remained in the Rankin family for more than 80 years. After the death of Thomas Rankin, the house was inherited by his children, Dorothy Bembridge and Neil Rankin. Dorothy Bembridge was a musician and a Long Beach school teacher until her retirement in 1968. Bembridge lived in the house starting in 1918 and noted that the interior was never renovated. She believed the curtains and soft floors created \\"a perfect acoustical environment\\" for frequent piano concerts held at the home. In 1969, the house was threatened with demolition when the City of Long Beach sought to expand the adjacent Drake Park. At the time, historical preservationists lobbied to save the structure. Bembridge sought to have it preserved as a music center. In comments to a local newspaper, she said: > \\"I pray it can be saved. It's a wonderful old house ‚Äî as solid as the Rock > of Gibraltar. There's not a break in the foundation; not a crack in the > walls. It's absolutely the only one of its kind in town that has not been > altered. It would have special charm as a music center. The tower serves as > a natural megaphone, making the acoustics remarkable. Many say they have > never heard anything like the sounds that ring out from the Steinway in this > old house.\\" In 1981, the Long Beach Cultural Heritage Committee designated Bembridge House as a Long Beach Historic Landmark. It was among the second group of structures to receive the designation. At the time of the designation, Bembridge told the Los Angeles Times that she was \\"content at last that the home she's lived in since 1918 will be preserved in all its magnificence.\\" In 1999, Bembridge was strangled at the house at age 89. Her body was discovered in the backyard on Novembee 4, 1999. Daniel William Borunda, a 51-year-old man who had done odd jobs for Bembridge and had been sent to prison for burglarizing her home in 1990, was eventually convicted of Bembridge's murder and sentenced to 60-years-to-life in prison. Borunda had been released from prison in October 1999, a few weeks before the murder. Police and prosecutors asserted that the motive was burglary and revenge. After Bembridge's death, Long Beach Heritage purchased the house in 2000 for $325,000. The group has restored the house to its original state and it is open for tours. In 2002, Long Beach Heritage received a $72,000 grant from the J. Paul Getty Trust to develop a master plan to preserve the main house, carriage house and aviary, and to restore landscaping and for seismic strengthening and improved access for the disabled. Bembridge House, located at 953 Park Circle Drive, Long Beach, California, was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 2005.

Design and development The Storm Century range of aircraft grew from the original \\"Storm\\" range developed and marketed by SG Aviation. The Storm were mainly sold as kits and flew in the ultralight or experimental categories, depending on the jurisdiction. The whole Storm range of aircraft are now manufactured and sold by Stormaircraft srl. The Storm Century is marketed in the United States and Australia as a Light Sport Aircraft, and in numerous other countries worldwide as an Ultralight (e.g. in Germany, Denmark and Australia). The aircraft is a low-wing, all metal design using a 100 hp (70 kW) Rotax 912UL-S engine. Other engines are available to order. The Century was initially fitted with an \\"all flying\\" combination horizontal stabiliser and elevator. Subsequently, as part of the development of the Century RG ‚Äì a retractable gear variant ‚Äì the vertical stabiliser and empennage was subtly redesigned and the horizontal tail surfaces were replaced by a conventional fixed horizontal stabiliser/elevator combination. From this modification a fixed gear alternative was developed and identified as the Century '04. A further development of the Century involved adding 25 cm to the length of the aircraft forward of the firewall (by way of a modified engine mount) and 15 cm to the aircraft immediately aft of the original cockpit. This 2+2 variant is identified as the Century 5XL and is manufactured with either the original or the Century '04 tail configuration. In addition the 5XL wingspan was increased by some 40 cm over the original. This variant is available as a 2-seat LSA or a 2+2 in the experimental category. The 5XL has an enhanced top speed of up to 130 knots TAS and a reduced stall speed together with extremely responsive handling. It appears that the modifications have contributed positively to the original aircraft.

Aftermath of the French revolution In the Revolution's aftermath, France was continually wracked with the quarrels between the right-wing Bourbonist restorationists and left- wing Revolutionaries; herein arose the clerical philosophers whose answer was restoring absolute monarchy and reinstalling the Roman Catholic Church as the official State Church of France. Return to a Golden Age Since then, France's history features said recurrent patterns of political thought, with reactionaries longing for an erstwhile pre-Revolutionary Golden Age, by repudiating two centuries of progress since the Revolution in 1789. (see Action Fran√ßaise) Joseph de Maistre Joseph de Maistre, even though not a French citizen (being a magistrate and diplomat of the Kingdom of Piedmont- Sardinia), is the Bourbon Restoration's philosopher of reaction; his writings are authoritative sources of reactionary ideas advocating authoritarian government of a society classified according to a divinely-established \\"natural inequality\\". A pessimist about Man's nature, he repudiated the Revolution's humanist principles and socio-political institutions, because they originated in the anti-Christian Enlightenment, saying it was God who created the State, not a human social contract; societal order and stability are paramount, yet feasible only via obedience to a Church-anointed absolute monarch; and that civil law expressed custom and tradition, not the fickle opinion of the people. In the book, Examen de la philosophie de Bacon (The Examination of the Philosophy of Bacon), he attacked Francis Bacon's materialism. Louis de Bonald Louis de Bonald was of the same cloth as De Maistre. He buttressed the convictions of already-convinced reactionaries; attacked the Revolution for creating individualism and centralization in government; championed absolute monarchy and the Church as the only means of securing domestic tranquillity. He proposed restoring the mediaeval guild system to ensure the rights (and obligations) of every French social class. Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand was an eloquent writer described as Rousseau in Catholic (black) dress, and is considered the first Romantic writer. Although not reactionary per se, he accepted Revolutionary change, but not its social principles. He mingled new institutions with old memories, traditions with ideals of the ancien r√©gime, so, in dressing the monarchic Restoration in Catholic trappings, he sought to the Bourbon R√©gime's stability via the people's devotion. Moreover, Chateaubriand wrote Christian-themed novels, such as Atala and Genie du Christianisme (The Genius of Christianity).

Regulators can include law enforcement agencies. Entities refers to those under the authority/control of the regulator ‚Äì in most cases ranging from individuals to companies to legal entities to multinationals operating within the regulator's jurisdiction. The process requires the regulator to directly link a robust risk assessment to a suggested regulatory response (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment). Regulatory risk differentiation is also referred to as the Compliance Model in some regulatory agencies.See for example http://www.acir.gov.au/provider/business/audits/ncp/our-compliance-model.jsp See for example the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority risk differentiation approach known as: PAIRShttp://www.apra.gov.au/adi/Documents/cfdocs/PAIRS_112010_ex.pdf / SOARS.http://www.apra.gov.au/adi/Documents/cfdocs/SOARS_112010_ex.pdf PAIRS is the Probability And Impact Rating System, while SOARS is the Supervisory Oversight And Response System.  Alternative compliance models   Dualistic model  The simplest compliance model is a regulatory framework or model known as dualistic, where the regulator reacts to an entity's behaviours depending on whether the behaviour is seen as either right or wrong. This is also known as a black and white response, and is often used for strict liability offences in law.Strict liability  Compliance continuum  It is a significant improvement to shift to a compliance continuum (or spectrum), where the regulator reacts to a spectrum of compliance behaviours. The Australian Customs Office applies a compliance continuum.See for example the Customs Compliance Continuum @ http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/FS_CustomsCompliance.pdf or http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/ComplianceContinuumv03.pdf or http://www3.sympatico.ca/d.kerr/contin.htmSee for example \\"Explaining the U.S. Income Tax Compliance Continuum\\" by Brian Erard (Carleton University ‚Äì Department of Economics) and Chih-Chin Ho (U.S. Internal Revenue Service)in the 'eJournal of Tax Research, Vol. 1, No. 2' @ https://ssrn.com/abstract=643942See Page 2 of STATE OF NEW YORK, DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE, Strategic Plan 2007/09 @ http://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/strategic_plan/strategic_plan_2007_09.pdf  Compliance pyramid  When the reaction of the regulator is tied to the behaviour, it is known as a responsive compliance model. The responsive compliance model was suggested by Ian Ayres and John Braithwaite in their book Responsive Regulation: Transcending the deregulation debateAyres, Ian and John Braithwaite (1992) \\"Responsive Regulation: Transcending the deregulation debate\\". New York: Oxford University Press which built on earlier work by John Scholz.J. T. Scholz, \\"Cooperation, Deterrence and the Ecology of Regulatory Enforcement\\" (1984) 18 Law & Soc. Rev. 179; J.T. Scholz, \\"Voluntary Compliance and Regulatory Enforcement\\" (1984) 6 Law & Pol. 385. The Ayres and Braithwaite compliance model was elegantly represented as a compliance pyramid.Ayres, Ian and John Braithwaite (1992) \\"Responsive Regulation: Transcending the deregulation debate\\". New York: Oxford University Press. Page 35. It was earlier described by John Braithwaite in \\"To punish or persuade\\", State University of New York, 1985, at page 142. The model's evolution over time is tracked in a paper by John and Valerie Braithwaite in \\"An Evolving Compliance Model for Tax Enforcement\\". alt=Alternative compliance models The shape of the compliance pyramid indicates: * the number of clients that might be found at each level in the model, * the hierarchical and escalating nature of regulatory engagement, and * the increasing focus towards the apex on the small minority who appear to deliberately seek to contravene the system. The choice of remedy (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment) imposed by the regulator becomes increasingly severe higher up the pyramid ‚Äì with the view of creating an incentive for entities to move towards more compliant behaviours. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) uses a compliance pyramid.See for example Law & Policy, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2007 In the mid-1990s the ATO's Cash Economy Project further developed their compliance pyramid. An entity's apparent motivation for compliance or non-compliance, based on evidence (known as their motivational posture), was explicitly coupled to a suggested response.Improving Tax Compliance in the Cash Economy, Second Report, ATO Cash Economy Task Force, 1998, Page 58 The ATO Compliance Model In this version of the compliance pyramid, four broad categories of client (called archetypes) were defined by their underlying motivational postures: * The disengaged clients who have decided not to comply, * The resistant clients who don't want to comply, * The captured clients who try to comply, but don't always succeed, and * The accommodating clients who are willing to do the right thing. This approach has been widely adopted, particularly within Australia. Several other regulators have similar approaches. It is also described as the enforcement pyramid by some regulators although enforcement is only one of the compliance strategies implicit in the model.See Australian Medicare Compliance National Compliance Program, 2007‚Äì08, Medicare Australia or page 31 of http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/2/0/odonnell_ch2_497.pdf or Page 33 of http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/tax_cooperation/gen_overview/Risk_Management_Guide_for_tax_administrations_en.pdf The strength of the model is the regulator being seen to apply the right remedy to the right situation, by taking an entity's apparent motivation (including their efforts to comply) into account. See for example Julia Black's paper: \\"'Chancer', 'Failure' or 'Trier'? Regulatory Conversations and the Construction of Identities\\" July 2008https://www.lexplosion.in or \\"The ATO Compliance Model in Action: A Case Study of Building and Construction by Neal Shover, Jenny Job and Anne Carroll\\"http://demgov.anu.edu.au/papers/ShoverEtal2003TD(8).pdf and \\"Reducing the risk of policy failure: challenges for regulatory compliance\\"OECD 2000, http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/54/1910833.pdf In the OECD paper \\"Reducing the Risk to Policy Failure: Challenges for Regulatory Compliance\\"See Box 2 page 12 in \\"Reducing the Risk to Policy Failure: Challenges for Regulatory Compliance,\\" OECD, 2000 @ http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/54/1910833.pdf the regulatory responses were distilled down to ensuring that clients were ready, willing and able to comply. * Ready > Clients who know what compliance is > Knowledge constraint > Educate and Exemplify * Willing > Clients who want to comply > Attitudinal constraint > Engage, Encourage, Enforce * Able > Clients who are able to comply > Capability constraint > Enable and Empower A similar framework is used in the UK Pension Regulator approach.See pages 8 onward in the 2012‚Äì15 Corporate Plan @ http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/corporate-plan-2012-2015.pdf  Risk bow-tie diagram  Another way of looking at this is as a risk bow-tie.

Organisations in oil and gas, mining, aviation, industrials and finance have had success using bowties.RPS HSE & Risk Management - BowtieXPRisk Bow Ties: Originally conceived of in the late 1970s by the University of Queensland and then brought to the fore by Shell after the Piper Alpha disaster. Now a widespread risk approach the 'bow-tie' usefully shows the 'paths' by which a risk event can occur, where preventative or deterrent controls are used, the event itself and detective controls and the consequence paths and restorative controls. http://www.bowtiepro.com/bowtie_history.asp These compliance enhancement strategies fit into a standard structure: * deter, (educate, exemplify, engage, encourage, enable, empower) * detect, (using quantitative and qualitative intelligence) and * deal with (educate, exemplify, engage, encourage, enable, empower, enforce)See for example page 47 of \\"Development of risk and intelligence systems\\" @ http://www.itdweb.org/documents/SGATAR-NZ- Risk%20and%20Intel%20v1.0%20061102.pptSee for example page 23 of \\"Large Business and tax compliance\\" @ http://ato.gov.au/content/downloads/bus33802nat8675062010.pdf and the Commissioners Speech \\"Do you see what I see\\" @ http://ato.gov.au/corporate/content.asp?doc=/content/00228656.htm What happens when the law is uncertain? Some commentators do not believe that the compliance pyramid applies when legitimate differences of views exist as to compliant behaviour.See for example: Mark Burton's detailed paper \\"Responsive Regulation and the Uncertainty of Tax Law ‚Äì Time to Reconsider the Commissioner's Model of Cooperative Compliance?\\" @ http://www.atax.unsw.edu.au/ejtr/content/issues/previous/paper4_v5n1.pdf, eJournal of Tax Research, Volume 5, Number 1 July 2007 Regulators all need to establish their positions in this situation, but it is clear that some regulators do still apply the compliance pyramid when the law is uncertain.See for example the Large business and tax compliance booklet @ http://www.ato.gov.au/corporate/content.aspx?doc=/content/33802.htm  Risk matrix mapping ‚Äì risk differentiation framework  Explicitly considering the likelihood and consequence of the risk of regulatory non-compliance Some regulators vary regulatory risk differentiation approaches by mapping suggested remedies to an entity's perceived risk of non-compliance. This approach has been used by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Australian Taxation Office and the UK Pension RegulatorSee for example \\"Supervisory Oversight And Response System\\" @ http://www.apra.gov.au/adi/Documents/cfdocs/SOARS_112010_ex.pdfSee for example \\"Developing an enhanced relationship ‚Äì achieving voluntary compliance and minimising costs to clients\\" @ http://www.ato.gov.au/taxprofessionals/content.asp?doc=/content/00187285.htm&pc;=001/001/001/002/002&mnu;=4068&mfp;=001/005&st;=&cy;=1See for example pages 8 on in the UK Pension Regulator 2012-15 Corporate plan @ http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/corporate-plan-2012-2015.pdf Explicitly considering the likelihood and consequences of an entity possibly breaking a law is a requirement of the UK Statutory Code of Practice for RegulatorsThe UK Statutory Code of Practice for Regulators is available @ which emerged from the 2005 Hampton Report \\"Reducing administrative burdens ‚Äì effective inspection and enforcement\\".The Hampton report is available @ The later Macrory Review \\"Regulatory Justice ‚Äì making sanctions effective\\"The Macrory Review is available @ effectively codifies the Ayres and Braithwaite Compliance Pyramid into the UK Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008.The UK Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 is available @ http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/13/pdfs/ukpga_20080013_en.pdf In these compliance models the possibility of entities breaking a law has both a likelihood of occurrence and a consequence of occurrence, known as a 'risk event'. Considering entities' likelihood of not complying and the consequences of their not complying usually provides a 'power distribution'See for example \\"Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law\\" by M. Newman, 2006 @ https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0412004v3 of a few large consequence or higher likelihood clients and many more lower consequence/likelihood ones. This can be represented as a scatter plot on a risk matrix, as shown in the adjacent diagram. Scatterplot of ratings of risk of entities breaking a law The scatterplot risk matrix to the left shows that most entities are compliant most of the time ‚Äì in other words, assessed as both lower consequence and lower likelihood of their not complying with the law. From a risk management perspective the regulator has a more significant interest in higher consequence clients or events than lower consequence. The next two diagrams build on the scatterplot diagram to the left. ATO risk matrix In this example, The ATO links its strategies to the likelihood and/or consequences of entities not complying with a law. The ATO risk matrix to the left shows how the ATO divides its clients into four categories, and allocates appropriate detection strategies to each category. These strategies are proactive and continuous for higher consequence, reactive and periodic for lower consequence. The strategies are reviewing for taxpayers more likely to break the law, and only monitoring for those less likely. Detailed ATO risk matrix The diagram to the left provides more detail, giving names to each category of client, providing all of the strategies - deter, detect and deal with strategies, and the strategies' associated activities. It is important to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk. This allows more resources to be allocated to more intensive strategies focusing on higher risk entities, providing an incentive to entities to want to be seen to be compliant. The robustness of the risk assessments, and the quality of the data on which the assessments rely, are therefore very important. The diagram below shows how end to end risk management steps (from ISO 31000) align with risk differentiation and the risk bow-tie. alt=Bowtie approach◊ÄAligning risk management steps with the bow-tie and risk differentiation  Use of the regulatory risk differentiation approach, including awards  In September 2009 the UK Pension Regulator, which uses this approach, was shortlisted for a Better Regulation Awardhttp://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk - note that the page is cached so you will need to search on the site for 'better regulation award 2011' The above approach was discussed in the ATO Commissioners speech \\"Do you see what I see\\" given to the Australian Tax Teachers Association in January 2010.Do you see what I see?

Sovereignty of papal power The work is divided into four parts. In the first he argues that, in the Church, the Pope is sovereign, and that it is an essential characteristic of all sovereign power that its decisions should be subject to no appeal. Role of papal infallibility According to Maistre, the Pope is consequently infallible in his teaching, since it is by his teaching that he exercises his sovereignty. Maistre's argument in favor of papal infallibility stands out in the history of theology because he was among the earliest Catholic writers to openly discuss the doctrine, which was not dogmatically defined until the end of the 19th century. Maistre mostly writes from the perspective of the ordinary magisterium having an infallible character, whereas the First Vatican Council defined a dogma on the infallibility of the extraordinary papal magisterium, in the limited circumstances when the Pope decides that it is time to define a dogma. Nevertheless, among modern theologians it is generally agreed that certain forms of the ordinary magisterium can at times be infallible, such as the bull Apostolicae curae or the encyclical Ordinatio sacerdotalis, as John Paul II explained in Ad Tuendam Fidem. Relations with temporal powers In the remaining divisions the author examines the relations of the pope and the temporal powers, civilization and the welfare of nations, and the schismatic Churches. He argues that nations require protection against abuses of power by a sovereignty superior to all others, and that this sovereignty should be the papacy, the saviour and maker of European civilization. Relations with schismatic Churches As to the schismatic Churches, Maistre believed that they would fall into philosophic indifference as Catholicism was the only religion fully capable of being compatible with science.Joseph-Marie, Comte de Maistre\\".

It is in these caves that the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. Israel Nature and Parks Authority took over the site following the end of the 1967 war, when Israel occupied the West Bank and seized Qumran. Israel has since invested heavily in the area to establish the Qumran caves as a site of \\"uniquely Israeli Jewish heritage\\". The caves are recognized in Israel as a National Heritage Site, despite the caves being in occupied Palestinian territories; as such, the designation has drawn criticism.Israel heritage plan exposes discord over West Bank history, BBC News, 16 April 2013: \\"Israel has occupied the area since the 1967 Middle East war, and its designation of sites there as part of its national heritage has drawn criticism.\\" History The limestone cliffs above Qumran contain numerous caves that have been used over the millennia: the first traces of occupation are from the Chalcolithic period then onward to the Arab period.de Vaux 1973, p. 51. The artificial caves relate to the period of the settlement at Qumran and were cut into the marl bluffs of the terrace on which Qumran sits. Dead Sea Scrolls Scrolls in situ In late 1946 or early 1947, a Bedouin boy of the Ta'amireh tribe, Muhammid Ahmed el-Hamed called edh-Dhib (the wolf), found a cave after searching for a lost animal. He stumbled onto the first cave containing scrolls from two thousand years ago. More Ta'amireh visited the cave and scrolls were taken back to their encampment. They were shown to Mar Samuel of the Monastery of Saint Mark in April 1947 and the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls was made known. The location of the cave was not revealed for another 18 months, but eventually a joint investigation of the cave site was led by Roland de Vaux and Gerald Lankester Harding from 15 February to 5 March 1949.VanderKam 2002, pp. 9, 12. The interest in the scrolls with the hope of money from their sale initiated a long area-wide search by the Ta'amireh to find more such scrolls, the first result of which was the discovery of four caves in Wadi Murabba'at about 15 kilometers south of Qumran in 1951.Allegro 1956, p. 35. In the Qumran area another cave was discovered, now referred to as Cave 2Q (1Q was the first scroll-bearing cave), in February 1952. However, only a few fragments were found in the cave.VanderKam 2002, p. 15. Fear of the destruction of archaeological evidence with the discovery of caves by the Bedouin led to a campaign by the French and American Schools to explore all other caves to find any remaining scrolls. Although 230 natural caves, crevices and other possible hiding places were examined in an 8-kilometer area along the cliffs near Qumran, only 40 contained any artifacts and one alone, 3Q, produced texts, the most unusual being the Copper Scroll.Allegro 1956, p. 36.Patrich 1994, p. 74. Qumran pottery 4Q was discovered in September 1952 by the Ta'amireh. De Vaux, on being offered a vast amount of fragments, contacted Harding who drove the Qumran site to find that the Bedouin had discovered caves very near the Qumran ruins. These were Caves 4Q, 5Q, and 6Q, the most important of which was 4Q which originally contained around three-quarters of all the scrolls found in the immediate Qumran area.Allegro 1956, p. 37. The first two of these caves had been cut into the marl terrace. The third was at the entrance to the Qumran Gorge just below the aqueduct.Humbert 2003, p. 67. In 1955 a survey of the terrace brought to light a staircase leading down to the remains of three more artificial caves, 7Q, 8Q and 9Q at the end of the Qumran esplanade,VanderKam 2002, p. 18.Broshi 1999, p. 333. all of which had collapsed and had been eroded, and a fourth cave, 10Q, on the outcrop which housed Caves 4Q & 5Q. The last cave containing scrolls to be found, once again by the Ta'amireh, was Qumran Cave 11 (11Q), discovered in early 1956. Among its contents were the Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll, the Great Psalms Scroll, and the Temple Scroll, though the latter had been spirited away and its recovery was to prove long and complex. In February 2017, the discovery of cave 12Q was announced, the contents of which included completely broken storage jars and scroll fragments, but no scrolls themselves. The cave was investigated by J. Randall Price and students of Liberty University in Virginia, along with an international team of archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. Iron pickaxe heads from the 1950s were also found, which indicate looting had occurred. In addition, archaeologists discovered pottery, flint blades, arrowheads, and a carnelian seal that date to the Chalcolithic and Neolithic periods. \\"This exciting excavation is the closest we‚Äôve come to discovering new Dead Sea scrolls in 60 years. Until now, it was accepted that Dead Sea scrolls were found only in 11 caves at Qumran, but now there is no doubt that this is the 12th cave\\", reported Dr. Oren Gutfeld, the head of the excavations. Acccording to Israel Hasson, Director- General of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), the discovery of this cave showed that significant works were waiting to be done in the Judean Desert and some of important ones were waiting to be revealed. Artificial caves Caves 4Qa right & 10Q left of upper center, seen from Wadi Qumran to the south In all there are ten marl cut caves in the near vicinity of Qumran: 4Qa, 4Qb, 5Q, 7Q, 8Q, 9Q, 10Q, an oval cave west of 5Q, and two caves to the north in a separate ravine.Broshi 1999, p.334. Their location necessitates a direct connection with the Qumran settlement. The three caves at the end of the esplanade could only be accessed via the settlement. These caves are thought to have been cut for storage and habitation. Marl is a soft stone and makes excavation relatively easy, but as seen with Caves 7Q‚Äì9Q they have not survived well. 4Q, which is now visible from the Qumran esplanade,Before the cave was found, there was nothing to indicate its presence except for a small hole in the vertical face of the wadi wall. Allegro 1956, p. 37. is actually two caves, one adjacent to the other. De Vaux referred to them as 4a and 4b. When the Ta'amireh removed all the fragments they could before Harding's arrival, there was no way to tell which scrolls belonged to which cave, so they were later all catalogued simply as from 4Q. In excavating the caves hundreds of fragments were still to be found in 4a while only two or three fragments in 4b. 4a was 8m long and 3.25 m wide with tapering walls reaching 3m in height.Humbert 2003, p. 96. Archaeological excavations In 1984‚Äì1985 Joseph Patrich and Yigael Yadin carried out a systematic survey of over 57 caves north of Qumran and two to the south.Patrich 1994, p. 75. In 1985‚Äì1991 Patrich excavated five caves, including Caves 3Q and 11Q. One of Patrich's conclusions was that the caves \\"did not serve as habitations for the members of the Dead Sea Sect, but rather as stores and hiding places\\".Patrich 1994, p. 93. Patrich took a jack hammer into 3Q to break up and remove large fallen rocks in order to discover that under the rocks there were only a few Chalcolithic sherds, showing that the ceiling had collapsed before any Qumran era occupation could have happened. The cave was uninhabited and used only to store the scrolls left there.Patrich 1994, p. 77. In 1988 in the cave Patrich designated as Cave 13, just north of 3Q, a small juglet was found from the Herodian era, which was wrapped in palm fibres and contained a viscous liquid which Patrich presumed was aromatic balsam residue. In 1991 he discovered several jar stoppers and a complete jar along with date stones and dry dates suggesting occupation, but as the area in front of the cave showed no attempt to convert it into a terrace, he concluded that occupation was not of any length.Patrich 1994, p. 91. 11Q was examined and no traces of Qumran era occupation was found.Patrich 1994, p. 90. A cave Patrich called Cave 24, which lay between 11Q and 3Q, was large and habitable, but showed no sign of long- term habitation. Cave FQ37 (named in the 1952 survey) located high up on the cliff face 2 kilometers south of Qumran was also an improbable site for permanent dwelling, due to its inaccessibility. In late 1995 and early 1996, Magen Broshi and Hanan Eshel carried out further excavations in the caves north of Qumran. They reported other caves not examined by Patrich and believed that they served as dwellings for the inhabitants of Qumran along with other artificial caves that have long ago eroded away from the edge of the marl terrace.Broshi 1999. Broshi and Eshel concentrated their interest in the area just north of Qumran, examining two caves they designated as C and F in a small ravine. The former had part of its ceiling caved in and was filled with silt from flash floods, but contained 280 potsherds. Cave F had completely collapsed, but when excavated yielded 110 potsherds. They concluded that the area was residential.Broshi 1999, p. 330.

Background  At least one East Syriac diocese in Khorasan existed by the beginning of the fifth century, though it was not assigned to a metropolitan province in 410. After establishing five metropolitan provinces in Mesopotamia, Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac provided that 'the bishops of the more remote dioceses of Fars, of the Islands, of Beth Madaye, of Beth Raziqaye and of the country of Abrashahr must accept the definition established in this council at a later date'. By implication, Abrashahr (Nishapur) already had a bishop at this period.Chabot, 273 Four East Syriac dioceses in Khorasan and Segestan are attested a few years later. The bishops Bar Shaba of Merv, David of Abrashahr, Yazdo√Ø of Herat and Aphrid of Segestan were present at the synod of Dadisho in 424.Chabot, 285 The uncommon name of the bishop of Merv, Bar Shaba, means 'son of the deportation', suggesting that Merv's Christian community may have been deported from Roman territory. The diocese of Segestan, whose bishop probably sat at Zarang, was disputed during the schism of Narsa√Ø and Elisha in the 520s. The patriarch Aba I resolved the dispute in 544 by temporarily dividing the diocese, assigning Zarang, Farah and Qash to the bishop Yazdaphrid and Bist and Rukut to the bishop Sargis. He ordered that the diocese should be reunited as soon as one of these bishops died.Chabot, 339-45 The Christian population of the Merv region seems to have increased during the sixth century, as the bishop of Merv was recognised as a metropolitan at the synod of Joseph in 554 and Herat also became a metropolitan diocese shortly afterwards. The first known metropolitan of Herat was present at the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585. The growing importance of the Merv region for the Church of the East is also attested by the appearance of several more Christian centres during the late fifth and sixth century. By the end of the fifth century the diocese of Abrashahr (Nishapur) also included the city of Tus, whose name featured in 497 in the title of the bishop Yohannis of 'Tus and Abrashahr'. Four more dioceses seem also to have been created in the sixth century. The bishops Yohannan of 'Abiward and Shahr Peroz' and Theodore of Merw-i Rud accepted the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554, the latter by letter, while the bishops Habib of Pusang and Gabriel of 'Badisi and Qadistan' adhered by proxy to the decisions of the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585, sending deacons to represent them.Chabot, 366 and 423 None of these four dioceses is mentioned again, and it is not clear when they lapsed. Timothy I consecrated a metropolitan named Hnanisho for Sarbaz in the 790s. This diocese is not mentioned again. In 893 Eliya of Damascus listed both Merv and Herat as metropolitan provinces. Segestan was a suffragan diocese of Herat, while Merv had suffragan dioceses for 'Dair Hans', 'Damadut', and 'Dabar Sana√Ø', three districts whose locations are entirely unknown.Assemani, BO, ii. 485‚Äì9 By the eleventh century East Syriac Christianity was in decline in Khorasan and Segestan. The last-known metropolitan of Merv was Abdisho, who was consecrated by the patriarch Mari (987‚Äì99). The last-known metropolitan of Herat was Giwargis, who flourished in the reign of Sabrisho III (1064‚Äì72). If any of the suffragan dioceses were still in existence at this period, they are not mentioned. The surviving urban Christian communities in Khorasan suffered a heavy blow at the start of the thirteenth century, when the cities of Merv, Nishapur and Herat were stormed by Genghis Khan in 1220. Their inhabitants were massacred, and although all three cities were refounded shortly afterwards, it is likely that they had only small East Syriac communities thereafter. Nevertheless, at least one diocese survived into the thirteenth century. In 1279 an unnamed bishop of Tus entertained the monks Bar Sawma and Marqos in the monastery of Mar Sehyon near Tus during their pilgrimage from China to Jerusalem.  The diocese of Merv  The bishop Barshabba ('son of the deportation') of Merv was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho in 424.Chabot, 285 The bishop 'Pharumai', 'bishop of the town of Merv', was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Acacius in 486.Chabot, 306 The bishop Yohannan of Merv was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497.Chabot, 315 The bishop David, 'bishop, metropolitan of Merv', adhered by letter to the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554.Chabot, 366 The priest Maraq was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585, on behalf of the metropolitan Gregory of Merv.Chabot, 423 The metropolitan Eliya of Merv was among the bishops present at the deathbed of the patriarch Ishoyahb III in 659.Sliba, 56‚Äì7 (Arabic) The metropolitan Abdisho, formerly bishop of Ispahan, was appointed metropolitan of Merv by the patriarch Mari (987‚Äì99).Sliba, 94 (Arabic) He was metropolitan of Merv when Elijah of Nisibis completed his Chronography in 1018/19.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 35  The diocese of Herat  The bishop Yazdo√Ø of Herat was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho in 424.Chabot, 285 The bishop Yazdad of Herat adhered by letter to the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497.Chabot, 311 The priest Daniel was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585, on behalf of the metropolitan Gabriel of Herat.Chabot, 423 The metropolitan Aristus of Herat was degraded during the patriarchate of Sliba-zkha (714‚Äì28) and replaced by Yohannan, who was himself degraded during the patriarchate of Pethion (731‚Äì40) and replaced by Panahisho.Fiey, POCN, 89  The diocese of Segestan  The bishop Aphrid of Segestan was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho in 424.Chabot, 285 In 540 the diocese of Segestan was disputed between two bishops, Yazdaphrid and Sargis, consecrated during the schism of Narsa√Ø and Elisha. The patriarch Mar Aba I, after taking evidence for both parties, resolved the dispute by temporarily dividing the diocese, placing Yazdaphrid in charge of 'the church of the Christians of Zarang, Farah and Qash' and Sargis over the churches of Bist and Rukut. He insisted that the diocese should be reunited after the death of one or other bishop.Chabot, 339-45 The bishop Kurmah of Segestan was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.Chabot, 368 The patriarch Sabrisho III consecrated Giwargis of Kashkar a bishop shortly after his consecration in 1063/4 'and sent him to Khorasan and Segestan'.

Declaration  Upon landing in France, the future king rejected the provisional constitution proposed by the Senate as part of the Treaty of Paris, stating that \\"the principles thereof were good\\" but since a great number of articles displayed the haste with which they were worded, \\"it could not in their present form become fundamental laws of the State.\\" However, he promised to adopt a new \\"liberal constitution\\" to be drafted by a commission drawn by the Parliament. Louis declared that the constitution would maintain representative government with a bicameral legislature, protect freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, and freedom of worship, and guarantee personal and public liberty. The declaration stated, notably, that the lands of the aristocrats who fled, which the Republic had sold at auction, were not to be confiscated, and that no restitution was to be given. Further, that the Napoleonic Code of Law was to remain in force, that the awards and social function of the Legion of Honor given to those loyal to Napoleon was not to be abolished. Napoleon's changes to the educational system, most notably the University of Paris, would remain. It was the desire to restore all these issues to their pre-revolutionary conditions that most dramatically defined a reactionary. Many of the Ultras held these notions, thus becoming far more reactionary than the King's own policies. The promised constitution was eventually adopted in the Charter of 1814.

The study is expected to be completed by March next year. The report and the demands would then be submitted to the state government as also to government bodies, like the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Since local civic bodies such as the Lonavla Municipal Council, the Vadgaon Gram Panchayat, the Talegaon Dabhade Municipal Council and the Dehu Gram Panchayat do not have necessary facilities to treat domestic effluents which get released in the river directly., the action committee would assist the civic bodies in setting up these essential facilities with the help of the state government.

Background  By 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in a state of chaos. Alexios I Komnenos had just overthrown Nikephoros III Botaneiates, and was confronted with the challenge of dealing with the imminent invasion of the Balkans by Robert Guiscard, the Norman Duke of Apulia. Guiscard had used the overthrow of Emperor Michael VII by Nikephoros III in 1078 as a pretext for launching a full-scale assault against the empire. By 1081, either by a stroke of good fortune or by some creative manipulation there was waiting for him at Salerno a man who claimed to be Robert‚Äôs son-in-law, the deposed emperor Michael VII. It was soon clear that this monk, Raiktor, was not in fact the deposed emperor. Though Michael had indeed become a monk after he was deprived of his throne, by 1081 he had been elevated in the church hierarchy by becoming first a bishop and then an archbishop, and was currently residing at Constantinople. Nevertheless, it was too good an opportunity for Guiscard to resist. Needing a good pretext to launch a war that many of his nobles were unsure about, he accepted Raiktor‚Äôs claims to be his imperial relative by marriage. Receiving a letter from Raiktor which stated, \\"Your son-in-law Michael, who has been expelled from his kingdom has arrived here to solicit your assistance\\", he read it privately to his wife, and then in an assembly of all the Counts he showed it to them. In it, he recounted Raiktor's tale about how he‚Äôd been robbed of his wife and son and all his possessions by the usurper Botaneiates, and that against his will he had been clothed in a monk's garb instead of wearing a crown, and that he had now appeared as a suppliant. Swearing that he would no longer be held back, his nobles all agreed to launch a war against the Eastern Roman Empire. Declaring that because of their relationship he must restore the empire to Raiktor, daily he showed honor to the monk, continuing the charade that he was the Emperor Michael, giving him the best place at table, a higher seat, and excessive respect. Inevitably, he would commiserate himself on the sad fate of his daughter, and that because of consideration for his son-in-law, he didn‚Äôt like to speak about Michael‚Äôs misfortune. Not everyone was taken in by the deception. Guiscard's ambassador to Constantinople, Raoul, had just returned with news of the overthrow of Botaneiates. Laying eyes on Raiktor, he declared that the monk was an imposter, and that his story was a complete fabrication. He told Guiscard that he had seen the ex-emperor with his own eyes in Constantinople, apparently living in a monastery. At these words, the pseudo- emperor Michael became furious and began berating the Norman nobleman, unhappy that his deception had been uncovered. Guiscard, nevertheless, continued with his plans to replace Alexios with Raiktor. Campaigning with the Normans Passing over into the Balkans, he accompanied Guiscard in the Norman‚Äôs attempt to take the important city of Dyrrachium. Robert approached the city and declared he was there to restore his son-in-law Michael to the throne of Byzantium. The city governor declared that if they were to see Michael and recognize him, they would immediately open the gates and hand the city over to him. Raiktor was paraded before the city walls in a magnificent procession, escorted by soldiers and nobles, with a band playing music to accompany him. But when the city defenders saw him, they shouted insults at Raiktor, swearing that they did not recognize him. Seeing that his ruse was not working, Guiscard settled down for a lengthy siege. Nevertheless, word soon reached Alexios that Raiktor was deceiving a good many people, and increasing the numbers of Guiscard‚Äôs troops. He sought the aid of the Venetians, who approached Dyrrachium with all speed. When Guiscard became aware of their arrival, he sent his son Bohemund to greet them in the name of the emperor Michael and of Robert. Soon after this, Guiscard drops all mention of his son- in-law, as events in Italy soon saw him return there and Bohemund continued the campaign that Alexios eventually overcame. It is suspected that once his usefulness had passed, Raiktor was disposed of quickly and quietly. Identity  At the time, there was much discussion as to the identity of the monk. It is certain that he was a monk at the time he approached Guiscard, but prior to his taking monastic vows, it was widely believed that Raiktor was probably the cupbearer of the Emperor Michael Ducas. It is certain that he was not the ex- emperor himself. See Also *Pseudo-Alexios II *Andriscus *Eumenes III  References  * Anna Comnena, The Alexiad, translated by E.R.A.

Brooks and illustrator Kurt Wiese. (It is the last book in the series before the U.S. enters the era of World War II.) There are dramatic reports of a monster in the dark woods near the Bean farm. When local animals are subject to extortion, Freddy and his friends test their bravery confronting the unknown. Plot summary :\\"'When you‚Äôre alone,' said Freddy firmly, 'and you hear or see something scares you, the thing to do is walk right up and find out what it is.'\\" (p. 9) In answer, the stuttering frog Theodore challenges him to visit the Big Woods. The Woods were owned by Mr. Grimsby, who attacked animals. After he left, the Woods' reputation worsened. Not for the first or last time, Freddy and Theodore find it is easier to be brave when not in the Woods. When startled, they flee outside, only to meet their enemy Simon the Rat, who has seen their flight. He warns about a mysterious, killer \\"Ignormus\\". Simon‚Äôs return prompts a general meeting of the F.A.R. (First Animal Republic), a group once organized to tend the farm while the Beans vacationed. Many do not believe that Freddy was in the Big Woods, including Charles the rooster. :\\"'Or is it, as some old legends tell, a bird with the head of a lion?...Is its name, as Simon says, the Ignormus? No one knows.' :'If you just got up to tell us that you don‚Äôt know anything,' said Old Whibley...'you can sit down again. We knew that before.'\\" (p. 51) Freddy dares Charles to go into the Big Woods with him. Charles is frightened, but his wife Henrietta bullies him. The rooster and Freddy arrive independently in the woods. Freddy‚Äôs imagination turns a sighting of the rooster into a creature with a long snout and tail feathers. Charles in turn mistakes the pig. After Charles brags widely, they discover that they only saw one other. The animal‚Äôs bank is robbed, the Ignormus is suspected. Freddy disguises himself as a hunter, borrowing Mr. Bean‚Äôs shotgun. While investigating the old Grismby house Freddy fires at what he thinks is a snake, knocking himself out. When he revives the shotgun is missing. At the farm, the practical cow, Mrs. Wiggins modestly questions why such a terrible Ignormus would not confront Freddy. \\"'I don‚Äôt know what I mean...I just say what I think. You‚Äôre smart. It‚Äôs up to you to figure out what I mean.'\\" (p. 130) The Bean farm is robbed, and missing items are found in Freddy‚Äôs pigpen. Freddy gets a report that animals are being threatened in the name of the Ignormus. Investigating, an extortion letter in familiar handwriting is found. Jinx the cat is unimpressed with the pig‚Äôs deductions: :\\"'To the eye of the trained detective nothing is ever just what it seems to be.' :'What does that make you, then?' said the cat.\\" (p. 160) Suspiciously, walking the Big Woods road, seeking the letter writer, they once again meet Simon. Then a huge white shape with horns floats from the woods, and they flee. Returning to the Grimsby house, the missing shotgun is pointed at Freddy and Theodore from a window. Retreating to the bridge where the animals are leaving goods extorted from them, they encounter Charles talking with the Ignormus‚Äô small henchman. Hidden, Freddy mimics the henchman‚Äôs voice, insulting the rooster and sending him into a fighting fury. Charles wins the fight (and gains the reputation that follows him through the rest of the series). They discover that the henchman is Simon‚Äôs son just before he escapes. Frightened animals are starting to leave the farm when Freddy gives a speech pointing out that they are \\"deserting under fire\\". Animal patriotism and fighting spirit are roused. A beetle volunteers to climb up the shotgun barrels to gnaw out the gunshot. F.A.R. president Mrs. Wiggins organizes her troops. Charging the Grimsby house, they are halted by Simon. But he just has insults and seeks no compromise. The charge continues, the gun goes off, the gunpowder alone slightly injuring Freddy. The house is overrun, but they only find Simon and his gang. Old Whibley the owl reveals the final mystery, dropping on Freddy the weighted bedsheet used to allow the \\"Ignormus\\" to drift through air. Mrs. Bean is sympathetic about the rats' trials, and they accept her offer of hospitality, except Simon, \\"I don‚Äôt want kind words, and I don‚Äôt deserve them.\\" (p. 278) The rest of the animals throw a party. But at the end, Jinx observes that there will always be \\"Ignormuses\\". Illustrations There are 32 black and white, pen and ink drawings by Kurt Wiese. Each chapter starts with a half page illustration, while a full page illustration is placed close to an event within each chapter. Endpapers and a full color cover depict scenes from the book. Critical reception Each book in the series received moderately positive to strongly positive critical review in sources such as the Times Literary Supplement, and Hornbook, The New York Times, and Kirkus Reviews Library Journal (September 1, 1941) \\"The children who have eagerly followed the adventures of Farmer Bean's talking animals since the first story, To and Again, was published will hail with delight this new story of Freddy, the poetic pig...Kurt Wiese's humorous illustrations well portray the events in the solving of this rollicking animal mystery story.\\" Books (October 26, 1941) \\"The undeniable charm of this story, like the earlier Freddy books, is not in morals, but in crisp talk between the animals. This goes on in good American; a better language can't be found for give-and-take. I don't know that any one has called attention to a basic likeness in character between Freddy and Pooh; Freddy is not a pet, he is less wistful, but he has the same innocent vanity and boundless good will.\\" History An early review is September 1, 1941, placing the writing several months before the attack at Pearl Harbor, while war was gathering.

Historical great auditorium of the University, built in 1592. The town hall (Rathaus) in Hann. M√ºnden Weser Renaissance is a form of Northern Renaissance architectural style that is found in the area around the River Weser in central Germany and which has been well preserved in the towns and cities of the region.  Background  Between the start of the Reformation and the Thirty Years War the Weser region experienced a construction boom, in which the Weser, playing a significant role in the communication of both trade and ideas, merely defined the north‚Äìsouth extent of a cultural region that stretched westwards to the city of Osnabr√ºck and eastwards as far as Wolfsburg. Castles, manor houses, town halls, residential dwellings and religious buildings of the Renaissance period have been preserved in unusually high density, because the economy of the region recovered only slowly from the consequences of the Thirty Years War and the means were not available for a baroque transformation such as that which occurred to a degree in South Germany.  Origin of the term  The term, coined around 1912 by Richard Klapheck, suggested that the Renaissance along the Weser independently developed its own distinct style. Max Sonnen, who used the newly coined term in 1918 in his book Die Weserrenaissance, classified buildings, without regard for the circumstances of their historical background, but from a purely formal perspective in order to derive a history of the development of the style. The notion of a regional renaissance in the sense of an autonomous cultural phenomenon was based on a nationalistic mindset that had arisen since the end of the 19th century, in which things provincial also had their place in establishing identity (other examples include German Sondergotik, Rhenish or Saxon Romanesque architecture).Sonnen (1918) In 1964 J√ºrgen Soenke and the photographer, Herbert Kreft, presented an inventory of Renaissance buildings, which also went under the title of Die Weserrenaissance. In its closing remarks it said: This architecture is rooted in the landscape in which it stands. It is folksy because those who created it [...] came from the people. The Weser Renaissance is, simply, folk art. For Soenke an autochthonous (indigenous) evolution of architectural style lay hidden behind its common features. His work, that appeared in six editions up to 1986, helped to give this art-historical concept a level of popularity that went far beyond the realm of the specialist and became a kind of popular trademark.Kreft and Soenke (1986) The term Weser Renaissance gained international recognition thanks to Henry-Russel Hitchcock, who used it in his German Renaissance Architecture of 1981, although he stressed its distinctive regional features rather less and pointed out its more significant linkages with the overall historical development of Renaissance architecture. In more recent times the idea of a regional cultural identity, that did not exist in the Early Modern Period, was criticised in research by the Weser Renaissance Museum at Brake Castle, which had been founded in 1986. This research highlighted the carriers of cultural transference, such as the architectural drawing business, non- local architects, pan-regional builders and the obligatory, Europe-wide requirements of court fashion.  History  The hallmark of aristocratic building activity in the 16th century was the transformation of a medieval castle, the Burg, into a royal residence or Schloss. Initially these were often built with two wings, but later the enclosed courtyard, with its wings joined in the corners by imposing towers with flights of stairs, became the preferred layout for the homes of the aristocracy in the Weser region during the course of the 16th century, a form of building that was soon also adopted by its lesser noblemen. The characteristic Zwerchhaus (Middle High German: = quer i.e. across or lateral) with so-called welsch (i.e. Italian) gables was particularly well suited as a symbol of power, because on castles like those at Detmold, Celle or B√ºckeburg, which were surrounded by high ramparts, they could be seen from a long way off. In addition to four-sided castles, there were also castles with three wings, either geometrically fully enclosed, like the Wewelsburg, or opening onto the castle farmyard as at Schw√∂bber. Even double-winged and single-winged buildings were included in the repertoire of castle architecture along the Weser. These aristocratic designs were not only embraced by the lesser nobles; middle-class builders also copied the new forms of building in order to show off their growing social influence. Town halls, like those in Celle and Lemgo, were designed with gables along the sides and sometimes faced with an entire renaissance fa√ßade, as occurred in Bremen. From Nienburg, to Minden, Hamelin and H√∂xter, Hannoversch M√ºnden and Einbeck magnificent townhouses appeared, that were often distinguished by their great gateway into the inner hall. Other important architectural features of the Weser Renaissance style are the ornately decorated gables, the use so-called Bossenquader or bossage stone, the alcoves (Standerker, Ausluchten or Utluchten) and double windows.Die Weserrenaissance at www.weserbergland.com, accessed on 16 Sep 09. Church builders were also eager to explore new architectural designs. By elevating the position of the pulpit and placing it immediately opposite to and facing the pews, the importance of the spoken word within the Christian faith was also visible from the layout of the church interior. The castle chapels of Celle and B√ºckeburg are also clear examples of this arrangement as are the important parish churches of Wolfenb√ºttel and B√ºckeburg. Protestant art experienced a high point in the Weser region under the Schaumburg prince, Ernest, who at the beginning of the 17th century, had the Stadthagen Mausoleum and tomb built by Adriaen de Vries, which recalled the Florentine Renaissance. At the same time the goldsmith, Anton Eisenhoit created the altar decorations for the Catholic prince-bishop, Dietrich von F√ºrstenberg, and the sculptor Heinrich Gr√∂ninger, whose monumental tomb lies in Paderborn Cathedral.

It was the RAF's first metal-framed aircraft. Design and development Just after the end of the World War I the Air Ministry were keen to explore the use of all-steel airframes, partly because during the war spruce stocks had been seriously reduced. They were aware of Boulton & Paul's all-steel-framed, though probably unflown P.10 and the claims of the company designer, John North that such aircraft could be 10% lighter than their wooden framed equivalents. They therefore issued specification 4/20 for a steel framed version of the Boulton Paul Bourges twin-engined reconnaissance bomber and ordered one prototype, so that Boulton & Paul could continue to develop such structures. The P.15 Bolton was the result. Despite its later type number, the Bolton was ordered and flew before the more unusual but equally steel framed P.12 Bodmin. Thus the sole Bolton, serial J6584 was the first metal framed aircraft developed for the Royal Air Force. thumb In general terms the Bolton was similar to the Bourges, though larger all round; both were twin-engined, three bay biplanes with equal span, constant chord wings with no sweep or stagger.Flight 5 October 1922 pp.571-2 Both carried ailerons on upper and lower wings, though the wingtips of the Bolton were cut off square in the later Boulton & Paul fashion and lacked the protruding balances of the earlier machine. The interplane struts were quite wide chord, their twin triangular members covered in fabric. There were supporting sloping struts from the midpoints of the wing midsection to the upper fuselage longerons. The two 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lion engines were mounted just inboard of the inner interplane struts, not directly onto the lower wing but rather on (for the top part of the engine was uncovered for air cooling) a little nacelle which had at the front and below the propeller boss, a small radiator. Four-bladed propellers were fitted. The Bolton's fuselage was square sided except behind the wings where an extra central member made the upper section triangular. This was done to enhance the downward field of fire from the dorsal position. The pilot's cockpit was forward of the wings and in the nose there was another gunner's position. This crew member doubled as bomb-aimer from a windowed position slightly further forward in the lower fuselage, in a nose that looked much like that of the Bodmin. The tailplane was mounted at the top of the fuselage, with a fin and rudder that projected below the fuselage, protected by a tailskid. The rudder had a large horn balance that overhung the fin and its unusual forward extension that acted as a trimming surface. The single axle undercarriage was of much narrower track than that of the Bourges, mounted just inboard of the engines on pneumatically sprung and damped legs in the manner of the Bodmin. A pair of members converged from the legs to a single forward wheel, there to prevent nose- overs. The Bolton first flew, piloted by Frank Courtney in September 1922. Its career and performance remain largely hidden by official secrecy, though an estimated maximum speed of 130 mph (209 km/h) at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) did emerge. In a review of British aircraft in May 1924, some 20 months after the first flight,Flight 29 May 1924 pp.571-2 its name is listed in the index but without a page number. In contrast, the \\"Postal\\" Bodmin, though only just flown gets a paragraph. Nonetheless, Boulton & Paul's growing expertise in metal-framed twin-engined aircraft was rewarded by orders for seven Bugles and led to the Sidestrands and Overstrands that achieved squadron service, albeit in small numbers.

Training and education As an adolescent, Fraser attended the Maidenhead Grammar School in Berkshire, England. In the late 1940s, he worked at the Sunday Times as an editorial trainee while completing his National Service. From 1949 to 1952, Fraser trained at London's Saint Martin's School of Art together with contemporaries including Frank Auerbach, Sandra Blow, Sheila Fell, Leon Kossoff, Jack Smith, and Joe Tilson. Career Anthony Blunt and John Piper were among assessors that awarded Hamilton Fraser a one-year French government scholarship in Paris in 1953. Also in 1953, his premier solo exhibition was given at Gimpel Fils, London. In 1955, Fraser returned to England and for 18 months extended his artist incoming by writing for Arts Review.

Fraser's students at the Royal included Patrick Caulfield, David Hockney, Ron B. Kitaj, and Th√©r√®se Oulton. Art style and approach Loose Spinnaker by Fraser in 1996 Fraser's painting style was compared to that of Nicolas de Sta√´l and characterized in the way he layered thick bright paint with a palette knife to produce a collage-like effect. The landscapes were still clearly identifiable while nonetheless forming abstract and almost dream-like fields of color. Fraser also made chalk and wash drawing of dancers that contrasted in style with his paintings and highlighted his diverse talents. Fraser said ‚ÄúAn artist doesn't really choose what sort of pictures he paints. He paints what is there inside him. It is a sort of imperative.‚Äùhttp://www.artnet.com/artists/donald-hamilton-fraser/ Honors and distinctions Fraser was elected a fellow at the Royal College of Art in 1970, becoming an Honorary Fellow in 1984.The Times obituary At the Royal Academy of Arts, he was also made an associate RA in 1975 and a full Royal Academician (RA) in 1985.

He single-handedly founded the State Art Museum of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, named after I.V. Savitsky, an art museum based in Nukus, Uzbekistan. Life and work  Early years  Igor Vitalyevich Savitsky was born in Kiev in 1915 in the family of a lawyer. His father had Polish and Jewish roots (his grandfather was born in a Polish family, his grandmother was Jewish). His maternal grandfather, Timofey Florinskiy was a famous Russian slavicist and professor at Kiev University, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the author of many studies who created his own scientific school. His family later came under suspicion during the October Revolution and moved to Moscow. He trained as an electrician, having chosen to become as \\"proletarian\\" as possible. While studying at the factory school of the 'Serp and Molot' plant, where he received a specialty in electrical installation, he took private drawing lessons from Moscow artists R. Mazel and E. Sakhnovskaya. Since 1934, Igor Savitsky began studying at the graphic department of the Moscow Polygraphic Institute and then continued his studies at the Moscow Art School. In 1938‚Äì1941, he studied at the Institute for the Advanced Studies of Artists in the workshop of Lev Kramarenko, with whom had field trips to sketch in the Crimea and the Caucasus.  Karakalpakstan period  He first visited Karakalpakstan in 1950 to participate in the Khorezm Archeological & Ethnographic Expedition, underway since the 1930s and led by Sergey Tolstov. He subsequently moved to Nukus, Karakalpakstan‚Äôs capital, and continued living there until his death in Moscow in 1984. From 1957‚Äì1966 he assembled an extensive collection of Karakalpak jewellery, carpets, coins, clothing, and other artifacts and convinced the authorities of the need for a museum. Following its establishment he was appointed its curator in 1966 ‚Äì much to the dismay of rival archaeologist Madra Mandicencio.Tom Bissell, Chasing the Sea, Pantheon (2003). . pp. 323‚Äì324. Thereafter, Savitsky began collecting the works of Central Asian artists, including Alexander Volkov, Ural Tansykbayev and Victor Ufimtsev of the Uzbek school, and later those of the Russian avant- garde ‚Äì including Kliment Red'ko, Lyubov Popova, Mukhina, Ivan Koudriachov and Robert Falk ‚Äì whose paintings, although already recognized in Western Europe (especially in France), had been banned in the Soviet Union during Joseph Stalin‚Äôs rule and through the 1960s. Despite the risk of being denounced as an ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù, Savitsky sought out proscribed painters and their heirs to collect, archive, and display their works. With great courage he managed to assemble thousands of Russian avant-garde and post avant-garde paintings. Moreover, refuting the Socialist Realism school, the collection shook the foundations of that period of art history.The Savitsky collection now has its own website: http://www.savitskycollection.org, which, in addition to details of the collection, includes a page with details of the Friends of the Nukus Museum, an international support group that provides financial and other assistance to the museum that houses the Savitsky collection.https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-uzbek-museum-of-banned-soviet- art  Awards  * 2002. \\"Order for Great Achievements\\".

Paul Zehr (born June 16, 1968) is a Canadian professor of kinesiology and neuroscience, and an award-winning science communicator at the University of Victoria, in British Columbia, Canada. He is well known for his work in the neural control of human locomotion‚Äîparticularly how the arms and legs interact during walking‚Äîand neural plasticity associated with exercise training and rehabilitation. Zehr is best known to the general public as the author of the popular science books Becoming Batman: The Possibility of a Superhero (2008), Inventing Iron Man: The Possibility of a Human Machine (2011), and Project Superhero (2014).  Becoming Batman  Becoming Batman addresses the scientific feasibility of a human being ever achieving peak of performance embodied by the Caped Crusader, and is essentially a guide for understanding how the human body works and responds to exercise. Zehr, a long-time reader of comic books, drew on the combined expertise gained in undergraduate (BPE, McMaster University) and graduate (MSc) training in kinesiology with his knowledge of neuroscience (PhD; University of Alberta) and his more than 25 years of personal experience in martial arts. A main point of Zehr's book is that despite all the technology and gadgetry, there is a real person inside the batsuit who needs extreme training. Zehr often points out that this training includes not just Batman's muscles but also his bones.  Inventing Iron Man  Inventing Iron Man examines the Marvel superhero as a biological control problem. The book explores what it would mean to the human body, and the nervous system particularly, to use an integrated exoskeleton like the Iron Man suit of armor. Inventing Iron Man explores deeply the concept of brain-machine interface and develops the thesis that such an exoskeleton could only work if it were connected directly to the brain of the user. A main focus are the changes that would occur in the nervous system (neural plasticity) as a result of prolonged use of such a comprehensive neuroprosthetic.  Project Superhero  Project Superhero follows Jessie, a 13-year-old girl, and her diary as she documents a year-long school project called the Superhero Slam. Unlike his previous books, Zehr wrote Project Superhero with a middle school aged audience in mind, aiming specifically at girls. Where he previously used superheroes as a means for relaying scientific research and queries surrounding human physiology, he wanted to look at what \\"superheroes represent in our culture as seen through Jessie's eyes\\". Zehr interviewed real life heroes that provide Jessie with expert advice, including: Mike Bruen, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Clara Hughes, Bryan Q. Miller, Christie Nicholson, Yuriko Romer, Nicole Stott, Jessica Watson, and Hayley Wickenheiser. Illustrations were provided by Kris Pearn, known for work such as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. In 2015, Project Superhero was awarded a silver medal in Juvenile Fiction by the IPPY Awards.  Awards  * 2015 Science Educator Award.

(Norm) Thompson as a mail order business, it grew to annual sales of $200 million before it was sold to Golden Gate Capital Partners in 2006. The company sells clothing, gadgets, furniture, kitchen items, and gift items from its namesake catalog as well as from its Solutions and Sahalie brands. John Difrancesco serves as president and chief executive of the 500 employee company. History The company was founded by namesake Norman Anchor Thompson, Sr. in 1949 as a way to sell his homemade flies for fly-fishing. An immigrant from Britain, he had settled in Salt Lake City before fighting for Canada in World War I. After the war he lived briefly in Los Angeles before settling in Portland where he owned seven pipe shops and later two nightclubs during World War II. Thompson retired after the war as owner of the nightclubs and tobacco shops. He started the new business as a mail order only business by placing an advertisement in Field & Stream, and around 1951 handed it over to Peter Alport, his son-in-law. Alport was in advertising in New York City where he owned Parma Advertising. He worked to expand the company's product offerings beyond fly-fishing items and into clothing and other outdoor merchandise, plus he developed the company's slogan of Escape from the ordinary. During his tenure, Norm Thompson opened its first retail store in 1959, located in Northwest Portland. Namesake Norm Thompson died in 1968 from complications related to his exposure to mustard gas during his World War I military service in Europe. In 1973, Alport sold the business to Parker Pen Company, who opened a retail store at the Portland International Airport in 1975 and discontinued selling fly fishing items in 1977. Parker then sold the entire business to John Emrick in 1981 through a leveraged buyout. Solutions, a home and garden catalog, was created by Norm Thompson Outfitters in 1986, followed by the 1990 purchase of Early Winters which was later re-branded as Sahalie. About that time, they created a sleepwear and underwear catalog and named it The Primary Layer. In July 1988, the company opened an outlet store near the main store in Portland, naming it Cracker Barrel. Outlet location in Lake Oswego, Oregon By 1989, the company had grown to annual sales of $50 million, with 80 percent coming from the mail order business. At that time the company's headquarters and distribution center were in Beaverton, Oregon, along the Sunset Highway at Murray Boulevard. Growth came from creating new catalogs and through acquisitions such as the purchase of Seattle-based Early Winters. Products ranged from upscale clothing to gourmet food to gadgets and other unusual gift items. Ron Decker took over as president of the company in 1989, as Emrick retained the titles of chairman and chief executive officer (CEO). Norm Thompson Outfitters also conducted a once a year warehouse sale in June that brought in around $1 million in revenue through selling closeout type items. In October 1990, the company opened a new outlet location in Lake Oswego, Oregon. A Norm Thompson's catalog was named the 1990 Catalog of the Year by the National Direct Mail Marketing Association. Sales grew to around $70 million in 1991. A downtown Portland retail store was added in May 1993 across from the Pioneer Place shopping center on Fourth Avenue at a cost of $1 million. The store was unprofitable and closed in 1996. Also in May 1993, the company announced it would relocate the Oregon distribution center to the eastern U.S. to be closer to the majority of its customers. That October, Norm Thompson selected a site in Jefferson County, West Virginia for a new , $7.5 million distribution facility. At that time, 80 percent of the company's sales were east of the Mississippi River. Norm Thompson closed the Oregon distribution center in July 1994, and sold the site to Home Depot to become a home improvement store. The building had also served as company headquarters, with the business moving to temporary offices near Tektronix's then headquarters while they planned a new permanent headquarters in the Portland metropolitan area. In 1994, sales had grown to $100 million annually, and the company had around 350 full-time, permanent employees. Company headquarters in Hillsboro Construction began on the new headquarters in Hillsboro in February 1995 where the company would lease a building that would cost $6 million to build. Located in the Tanasbourne neighborhood, the two-story building was to house around 200 employees, with an adjacent call center for 150 employees. Designed by Sienna Architects and developed by the Trammell Crow Company, the new building was constructed using some recycled materials. The plan used many energy efficient designs and technology to create a building 40 percent more efficient than what Oregon law required. Norm Thompson grew to sales of $110 million and 400 employees for 1995, but had to cut back the next year when they closed the downtown Portland store along with shutting down The Primary Layer catalog. Cuts were made due to poor economic conditions. At the time, catalog sales represented 90 percent of revenues, and the closed catalog only contributed around 7 percent. After the closures, they still had two Portland stores and three outlet locations in Oregon. Also in 1996, Rebecca Jewett took over as president of the company while John Emrick retained his titles as chairman and CEO. The city of Portland gave the company a Businesses for an Environmentally Sustainable Tomorrow award for energy efficiency in 1997. Following the 2001 anthrax attacks, Norm Thompson stopped using corn starch in the catalog printing process to avoid the appearance of any powdery substance on the catalogs. Because of Norm Thompson Outfitters' use of environmentally friendly practices, including using recycled paper in catalogs, the Center for a New American Dream inducted the company into the Green Mail Hall of Fame in 2004. The company expanded their headquarters in 2005 by leasing an adjacent building. In March 2006, the company closed its original store in northwest Portland, leaving two outlet stores and the location at the Portland Airport as their only retail locations. At that time, sales at the company had grown to approximately $200 million annually, with the Sahalie and Solutions brands as the largest divisions. Sahalie had previously been the Early Winters brand and catalog. That same month Golden Gate Capital Partners' Catalog Holdings subsidiary purchased Norm Thompson. Catalog Holdings already owned brands such as Spiegel and Newport News. Neale Attenborough took over as CEO from Emrick after the sale. The Hillsboro call center was closed in 2007 with those operations consolidated with a sister company's operations in Pennsylvania, while the headquarters remained in Hillsboro with 150 employees. By 2008, the store at the Portland Airport had closed to be replaced by a Columbia Sportswear store. In May 2016, the company announced that it would be closing its Hillsboro headquarters, in late summer 2016. Around 80 people were working there, of which 46 were to be laid off and the others potentially relocated. Only 13 were due to continue working in the area, at a new satellite office near the to-be-closed headquarters office on Aloclek Drive. Operations Norm Thompson Outfitters is headquartered in Middleton, Massachusetts, while the distribution center is in Irvine, Pennsylvania.All stores are closed http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/retail/norm-thompson- outfitters,-inc/company-overview They sell high-end items ranging from men's and women's apparel to shoes, food, gift items. Furniture, and kitchenware among other products. More than 80 percent of customers are women. The Solutions brand is the biggest seller followed by the main Norm Thompson catalog and Sahalie.

Each figma is sold with various accessories such as exchangeable faces, hands and other optional parts. Occasionally figma figures are based on other subjects such as characters from the Japanese voice synthesizing software Vocaloid, to the popular Nintendo game series such as The Legend of Zelda and the Metroid series. A few figma figures are based on real people, such as a figma of Michael Jackson from his \\"Thriller\\" music video.  History  The first figma was a special edition Haruhi Suzumiya based on and bundled with the PS2 game, Suzumiya Haruhi no Tomadoi. It was released on January 31, 2008 with the product code SP001. Later in 2008, the first mass-produced figma, Yuki Nagato from the series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was released. The figma series has now surpassed its 300th release. To commemorate the release of the 200th Figma, GSC announced on their web site, a 2.0 version of the popular vocaloid, Hatsune Miku http://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/3991/figma+Hatsune+Miku+2+0.html  Specifications  figma #153: Link was released in late 2012. The figma series is an articulated series of figures made from ABS and PVC. Each figure includes a special stand that is used to hold it up as well as create varying poses. The height of the figures are around 13 cm, but vary depending on the height of the base character. Prices also vary, however most figmas are between 3000 and 6000 Japanese yen. Each figma usually comes with a number of different expressions and optional extras which can be switched out any number of times. Parts can also be traded between different figma figures, allowing collectors to swap parts and create unique combinations. A flexible plastic is used in areas likely to be hindered by poses. The figma motto is which translates into 'Moves well, looks good', which sums up the main purpose of the figma series. According to the official site, the concept of the series is summarized by the following four points: *Allows for both beauty and poseability: The figma series is designed to not only be highly articulated, but also well-sculpted and nice to look at. *Unique customization for every character: Each character is designed separately and in proportion with the original designs. *Hand-size figures: figmas are made about the size of a hand for ease-of-posing and display. *Use of the unique figma joints: The figma joints are highly precise and allow for great torque, allowing collectors to easily create the poses they desire.  Figma products  A number of figma related products and product lines exist, as described below. figma Series The primary figma series is split into three different variants: * Normal edition figmas with three-digit product codes, such as 001 * Special edition figmas with three-digit product codes preceded by SP, such as SP001‚Äîusually bundled with a video game, manga, or DVD * Limited edition figmas with three-digit product codes preceded by EX, such as EX001, sold at events such as Wonder Festival, a semi-annual event hosted by Good Smile Company, sometimes released via mail-order or through online orders di:stage The di:stage is a display unit for figma figures.

All tracks are at 1000 mm (metre gauge) width. There are three terminal loops, and two loops used rarely only when shorter route service is provided. There is also an inner city loop for the part of line 2, which connects the main railway station with the city centre.

Becoming Batman is unique in its explicit analysis of whether or not it is actually possible for a human being to achieve Batman status through training.

It remains the longest iron viaduct on the Spanish rail network.Ch√≠as Navarro, Prop and Abbot Balboa, Tom√°s: \\" Bridges of Spain \\", FCC, Madrid 1994, pag. 248, The bridge is maintained by RENFE.  Project  In 1889, the Southern Spanish Railway company began building a line from Guadahortuna, in the province of Granada in Spain. The company employed Duvel and Butilia, who were students of Gustave Eiffel, the famous engineer who had built the Eiffel Tower and Garabit viaduct in France and the Dona Maria Pia railway bridge in Oporto, Portugal. A site was chosen for the bridge between the Granadin cities of Guadahortuna and Alamedilla where the railway would cross the Guadahortuna River. Construction work began in 1893. Work was completed four years later. Hacho Bridge officially opened on March 22, 1898.  Construction  Hacho Bridge is long with a maximum height of at its highest part. It is a continuous under-deck truss bridge that stands on nine wrought iron trestles and stone piers. The structure's design is based around a central double beam that runs the whole length of the single-track crossing. This is supported by a trestle made from four iron girders that have cross bracing and are riveted together. The trestles stand on stone piers. A footbridge ran adjacent to the track.  History  The Hacho Bridge operated for more than sixty years. It was even used by both the Nationalists and the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. Hacho Bridge, which was the largest iron viaduct in Spain, was a major source of employment in the area. Hundreds of people lived for almost a decade near Alamedilla station during its construction. Many continued to live there after it opened, working on its maintenance. However, in the late 1950s living conditions in Eastern Andalusia, caused by postwar period austerity, meant many people left the area in search of work. At the same time, Spanish railways began to operate heavier diesel locomotives which were unable to use Hacho Bridge due to its maximum load weight. Ten years later the station at Alamedilla had been closed to passengers. A decade of years later, Spanish railways sold Hacho Bridge to a Madrid scrap dealer together with other bridges on the Almeria line for 1.5 million pesetas. In November 1978, local people began a campaign to save Hacho Bridge after they discovered that it was to be demolished. The Mayor of Alamedilla, D. Abelardo Corral, appealed to the Governor of Granada, D. Jos√© Maria Fernandez Fernandez. In a hastily convened meeting, the provincial government agreed with the local committee and declared Hacho Bridge a Historical Artistic Monument. This injunction was then served on the scrap and demolition company. The Civil Guard were ordered to go immediately to the bridge. They arrived just in time and dismantled the dynamite already installed at the base of trestles. Hacho Bridge is now protected by a national protection order as a Structure of Cultural Significance. Present day A reinforced concrete bridge was built in 1970 to replace Hacho bridge. It runs parallel to the original crossing.

Barrow, Alaska to Cape Horn, Chile in a Stemme SV10 motor glider. Early life Thys was born May 2, 1931 in San Francisco, CA). He grew up in nearby Sacramento, California, and graduated from Fountain Valley School, Colorado Springs, in 1948. He attended the University of Virginia, Sacramento Junior College, U.C. Berkeley, and Stanford, before graduating with a B.S. in Metallurgy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1953. A winner of the MIT Distinguished Air Force ROTC Cadets Award, he served in the United States Air Force as a Lieutenant from 1953 to 1955. Career In 1956, he and his brother Edouard took over a struggling, seven-person metal casting company in Berkeley, moved it to San Leandro, California, expanded it, and renamed it Precision Founders Incorporated (PFI). Thys found great fulfillment in the diversity of his work, from designing specialized equipment and championing new casting technologies to building a cost accounting system and serving as president of the Investment Casting Institute. He served 32 years as PFI's Vice President of Marketing, developing the company's sales force and acquired many large customers, chiefly in the areas of nuclear power, aircraft engines and aerospace. He also broadened the reach of U.S. investment casting technology into global markets by arranging technology transfers with customers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Egypt, Italy, France, Belgium and Germany. The company was sold in 1988 to Wyman-Gordon. Aviation and exploration An avid pilot from the age of 14, Thys held private and commercial certificates with instrument rating for single engine, land and sea, multi-engine aircraft, sailplanes and helicopters. In 1970, he made the world's third longest sailplane flight, a distance of . In 1976 he flew his twin-engine Piper Comanche from California across the Atlantic to the edge of the Iron Curtain. As a young man he raced sailboats; in 1990 he bought a Gulfstar 50 sloop, and in 1993 sailed it from Mystic, Conn., to San Francisco through the Panama Canal. In 1996, he purchased a Russian YAK 18-T and flew it from Smolensk, Russia, to Magadan. After graduating from the National Russian Helicopter Academy of Medyn in 1999, he embarked on three attempts to fly across Russia, often stymied by licensing and border-crossing issues, but finally made the trip, flying a Russian MI-2 helicopter from Almaty, Kazakhstan across the Bering Straits to Alaska, and then on to Oakland, California. In 2002, he made the first self-launched sailplane flight from Pt. Barrow, Alaska to Cape Horn in his Stemme SV10 motor glider, a trip of over . He was made a member of the New York Explorers Club in 2004. Death On August 19, 2009, Thys was flying solo in a two-seat 1998 Stemme S10-VT powered glider, joining Stemme pilots soaring in the vicinity of Arco, Idaho. At the end of the day he was reported missing after he failed to return. The aircraft was discovered the following evening in a Civil Air Patrol search in remote site in the White Knob Mountains at an elevation of about . On August 21 the Idaho Air National Guard provided a helicopter to transport a Custer County Search and Rescue team, which reached the crash site at about 11:21 a.m. Thys was found with the wreckage of the aircraft the morning about six miles (10 km) north of Copper Basin near Mackay.

From 1534 until 1920 the established church was the Church of England, but this was disestablished in Wales in 1920, becoming the still Anglican but self-governing Church in Wales. Wales also has a strong tradition of nonconformism and Methodism. Most adherents to organised religion in Wales follow the Church in Wales or other Christian denominations such as the Presbyterian Church of Wales, Roman Catholicism, Baptist and Methodist churches, and Eastern Orthodoxy. History Celtic origins Nearly 200 years before Constantine, Saint Lucius, a legendary 2nd-century King of the Britons (or Silures) is traditionally credited with introducing Christianity into Britain in the tenure of Pope Eleutherius (), although this is disputed. Christianity certainly arrived in Wales sometime in the Roman occupation, but it was initially suppressed. The first Christian martyrs in Wales, Julius and Aaron, were killed at Isca Augusta (Caerleon) in south Wales in about AD 304. The earliest Christian object found in Wales is a vessel with a Chi-Rho symbol found at the nearby town of Venta Silurum (Caerwent). By the end of the 4th century, Christianity became the sole official religion of the Roman Empire. Wales was the birthplace of the heretic Pelagius. As the Roman legions garrisoned in Wales withdrew in the early 5th century, invading tribes including the Angles and Saxons, who later became the Anglo-Saxon English, were unable to make inroads except possibly along the Severn Valley as far as Llanidloes. However they gradually conquered eastern and southern Britain (which then became England), thus leaving Wales cut off from her Celtic relations in Scotland, Cornwall and Cumbria. The writer Gildas drew sharp contrasts between the Christian Welsh at this time and the pagan Anglo-Saxon invaders, although at the same time lamenting the shortcomings of Welsh Christians. St. Meilig's Cross, Llowes, Powys. One side of this 'Celtic cross' was carved in the 7th century and the other side was carved in the 11th century. Emergence and Reformation 12c St Cwyfan's Church, Llangwyfan Eglwys-y-Grog, a 13th-century church in Mwnt, Ceredigion The age of the saints in the 6th and 7th centuries was marked by the establishment of monastic settlements throughout the country, by religious leaders such as David, Illtud, Padarn, and Teilo. This was the period when the Welsh developed a shared national identity, arising from their language and religious beliefs. The Welsh bishops refused to co-operate with Augustine's mission to the Anglo- Saxons. However, a combination of Celtic Christianity's reconciliation with Rome and English conquest of Wales meant that from the Middle Ages until 1920, the Welsh dioceses were part of the Province of Canterbury ‚Äì in communion with Rome until the Reformation. This participation in the Province of Canterbury continued afterwards as part of the Church of England. From the time of Henry VIII, Wales had been absorbed into England as a legal entity and the Established Church in Wales was the Church of England. Some books of the Bible and of the Apocrypha had been translated in the Middle Ages, but the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 passed under Henry VIII effectively banned the Welsh language from official use. However, under Elizabeth I the English Parliament passed An Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue 1563. In 1567 William Salesbury, Richard Davies and Thomas Huet completed the first modern translation of the New Testament and the first translation of the Book of Common Prayer (). Then in 1588 William Morgan completed a translation of the whole Bible. These translations were important to the survival of the Welsh language through the effect of conferring status on Welsh as a liturgical language and vehicle for worship. This had a significant role in its continued use as a means of everyday communication and as a literary language down to the present day despite the pressure of English. Abuses did occur, and English bishops were routinely granted benefices in Welsh-speaking areas despite not speaking any Welsh at all. This contravened Article XXIV of the Articles of Religion of the Church of England: In 1766, the churchwardens of the parish of St Beuno, Trefdraeth on Anglesey, supported by the Cymmrodorion, began a test case against an English clergyman, Dr Thomas Bowles, who could not conduct services in Welsh and whose attempt to do so had ended in ridicule. In its verdict in 1773 the Court of Arches refused to deprive Dr Bowles of his living, but did lay down the principle that clergy should be examined and found proficient in Welsh in order to be considered for Welsh-speaking parishes. Nonconformity and revivals Nonconformity was a significant influence in Wales from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The Welsh Methodist revival of the 18th century was one of the most significant religious and social movements in the history of Wales. The revival began within the Church of England in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it, but the Welsh revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was Calvinist rather than Arminian. Welsh Methodists gradually built up their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist Presbyterian church of Wales in 1823. The Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older nonconformist churches, or dissenters ‚Äì the Baptists and the Congregationalists ‚Äì who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was predominantly a nonconformist country. The 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh Revival was the largest full scale Christian revival in Wales in the 20th century. It is believed that at least 100,000 people became Christians during the 1904‚Äì1905 revival, but despite this it did not put a stop to the gradual decline of Christianity in Wales, only holding it back slightly. Disestablishment The Welsh Church Act 1914 provided for the separation of the four dioceses of the Church of England located in Wales (known collectively as the Church in Wales) from the rest of the Church, and for the simultaneous disestablishment of the Church. The Act came into operation in 1920. Since then there has been no established church in Wales. In 2008, the Church in Wales narrowly rejected a proposal to allow women to become bishops. Roman Catholicism Catholics are served by the Ecclesiastical Province of Cardiff, which exists out of the Archdiocese of Cardiff, the Diocese of Menevia and the Diocese of Wrexham. The bishops of these dioceses are part of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales. In total, the three dioceses counted 209,451 Catholics on a population of 3,112,451 inhabitants, equalling to a percentage of 6.7% Catholics. The three dioceses have 172 priests and 34 permanent deacons, 75 male religious and 267 female religious, and a total of 154 parishes as of 2016 (2017 for the diocese of Wrexham). However, the province is not completely equal to Wales, as the Archdiocese of Cardiff also covers Herefordshire, in England. Sabbatarianism The Sabbatarian temperance movement was strong among the Welsh in the Victorian period and the early twentieth century, the sale of alcohol being prohibited on Sundays in Wales by the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881 ‚Äì the first legislation specifically issued for Wales since the Middle Ages. From the early 1960s, local council areas were permitted to hold referendums every seven years to determine whether they should be wet or dry on Sundays: most of the industrialised areas in the east and south went wet immediately, and by the 1980s the last district, Dwyfor in the northwest, went wet; since then there have been no more Sunday-closing referendums. Saints A monastic community was founded by Saint David at what is now St David's. The present building of St David's Cathedral was started in 1181. Saint David is the patron saint of Wales. Wales is particularly noted for naming places after either local or well-known saints ‚Äì many or perhaps most places beginning in \\"church\\", e.g. Llanbedr ‚Äì St Peter (Pedr); Llanfair ‚Äì St Mary (MairSoft mutation changes the initial to , spelled in Welsh.); Llanfihangel ‚Äì St Michael (Mihangel); Llanarmon ‚Äì St. Garmon. Because of the relatively small number of saints' names used, places names are often suffixed by their locality e.g. Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Llanfihangel y Creuddyn, Llanfihangel- y-Pennant.

They were deemed unsuitable, however, and there is some doubt as to whether they ever left the Dart! .Kittridge,A. Passenger Steamers of the River Fal, Twelveheads Press, 1988 'Humphrey Gilbert' was seen and photographed in BR 'Rail Blue' livery at Weymouth Harbour in June 1977. British Rail repurchased them for use on the River Thames on the Gravesend - Tilbury Ferry. Again they were deemed unsuitable, both were re-engined and sold. MV Adrian Gilbert was sold to Dart Pleasure Craft, and returned to the Dartmouth-Kingswear Ferry. MV Humphrey Gilbert was laid up in Newhaven, East Sussex, and in 1978 was sold to Meridian Line Cruises of Greenwich on the River Thames, but remained laid up. In 1978 Humphrey Gilbert was purchased by the Millbrook Steamboat and Trading Co, renamed MV Edgecumbe Belle and used on the Plymouth - Drake's Island ferry, also relieving on the Cremyll Ferry from time to time. She remained with the Millbrook Company after it was taken over by Dart Pleasure Craft Ltd, but in 1985 Dart Pleasure Craft withdrew from the Plymouth area, and MV Edgecumbe Belle returned to the Dart, and joined her sister on the Dartmouth-Kingswear ferry. .Kittridge,A. Steamers & Ferries of the River Tamar & Three Towns District, Twelveheads Press, 2003 In 1996 the Adrian Gilbert was again sold to operate on the St Mawes Ferry, and was replaced by the MV Kingswear Belle. In 2000 Dart Pleasure Craft Ltd bought G.H. Riddalls and Sons fleet, and introduced the former Riddalls vessel Dartmouth Princess on the Kingswear ferry. MV Edgecumbe Belle was therefore used on a new service to Greenway Quay, where the National Trust had opened Agatha Christie's house and gardens to the public (incidentally this house was previously the home of the Gilbert family, after which the vessel was originally named). This service was later withdrawn and Dart Pleasure Craft instead market the Greenway Ferry Company's similar service. MV Edgecumbe Belle is now back as the relief boat on the Kingswear ferry, and sees considerable operation on the route, as the MV Kingswear Belle now appears to receive little use. It is interesting that Dart Pleasure Craft Ltd is now owned by Dart Valley Railway plc, owners of the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway, so the ownership and operation of the vessel have come full circle, and once again passengers from Dartmouth buy their train tickets to include the ferry to Kingswear.

A prolific writer, he is known for his anti-papal works. His views were Calvinist, conforming and non-separatist, and he appeared as a witness against Edward Dering before the Star-chamber. Joseph Hall (who knew him well) eulogised Willet in Noah's Dove, and Thomas Fuller modelled 'the Controversial Divine' of his Holy State on him. Life He was born at Ely in 1562, son of Thomas Willet (1511?‚Äì1598), who began his career as a public notary, and later in life he took holy orders, becoming rector of Barley, Hertfordshire, fourteen miles from Cambridge and admitted to a prebendal of Ely by his patron, Bishop Richard Coxe, with whom he had been associated as sub-almoner to Edward VI. Andrew had one brother and four sisters. After attending the collegiate school at Ely, he entered Cambridge University, matriculating at the age of fifteen (20 June 1577); he first went to Peterhouse, the master of which was Andrew Perne, his godfather, but in the same year moved to Christ's College, Cambridge. He was quickly elected a scholar, graduated B.A. in 1581, was elected to a fellowship at Christmas 1583 (aged twenty-one), proceeded M.A. in 1584, and in the same year was incorporated a member of the university of Oxford. He was B.D. in 1591, and D.D. 1601. Among the fellows of Christ's, he was on good terms with George Downham, and when Willet spent his vacations at his father's rectory of Barley, he was often accompanied by Downham. He took holy orders in 1585, and was admitted on 22 July 1587, on the presentation of the queen, to the prebendal stall at Ely, which his father had resigned in his favour. In 1588 Willet left the university, and at Michaelmas, on his marriage with Jacobine, a daughter of his father's friend Roger Goad, provost of King's, gave up his fellowship. He earned a reputation as a preacher of power, especially against the Catholics. He was selected to read the lecture for three years in Ely Cathedral, and for one year in St. Paul's Cathedral, London. In the same year he was presented to the rectory of Childerly in Cambridgeshire. This living he held till 1594. He was admitted in 1597 to the rectory of Gransden Parva in Huntingdonshire, but almost immediately moved, by exchange to Barley, his father having died in April 1598 in his eighty-eighth year. He was instituted on 29 January 1599. He spent most of his ministerial life at Barley, being rector for twenty-three years. Willet's village preaching is preserved in his Thesaurus Ecclesiae (an exposition of St. John xvii.), which contains the substance of afternoon lectures addressed to his parishioners. Willet persuaded Andrew Perne to leave by will an annual sum to the poor scholars of the free school founded in the village of Barley by Archbishop William Warham when rector; he also influenced his friend Thomas Sutton, founder of Charterhouse School. He was chaplain-in-ordinary and tutor to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, as well as a frequent preacher before the court. Willet got into trouble over the Spanish match, to which he was strongly opposed. Under care of Sir John Higham of Bury St. Edmunds he sent letters and arguments to the justices of Norfolk and Suffolk, urging them to protest against the marriage. Willet himself presented a copy of his arguments to the king, and, thereby incurring his high displeasure, was committed to prison under the custody of Dr. White. He appears to have been released after a month. Towards the close of his life he was admitted (19 Jan 1613) to the rectory of Reed, Hertfordshire, a parish adjoining that of Barley; but he only held it something over two years, resigning in favour of his eldest son, Andrew, who was admitted on 10 November 1615. The year before his death he was presented to the rectory of the small parish of Chishill Parva, across the border in Essex. Willet's death was the result of an accident. On his return home from London his horse threw him near Hoddesdon. His leg was broken and was set badly. Ten days later he died at the inn to which he had been taken (4 December 1621), in his fifty-ninth year. On 8 December he was buried in the chancel of Barley parish church. An effigy and brass were placed by his parishioners and friends over the place of burial. The effigy showed a priest, full-length, dressed in his doctor's robes, with square cap, ruff, and scarf, and wearing a beard. Works Willet published his major work, the Synopsis Papismi, in 1594, adding the Tetrastylon two years later. It was designed as a reply to Bellarmine, whom he seeks to confute the latter by an appeal to \\"scriptures, fathers, councils, imperial constitutions, pontifical decrees, their own writers and our martyrs, and the consent of all Christian churches in the world\\". He affirms that the church of England approves the first four ecumenical councils, and possibly the fifth; and he maintains the position of John Jewel on episcopacy. He argues strenuously against the mass, and inveighs against the mediaeval practice of regarding the mass as a vicarious and solitary sacrifice, at each celebration, of the one atoning death, but always holds \\"that Christ is present with all His benefits in the sacrament, that the elements of bread and wine are not bare and naked signs of the body and blood of Christ\\". One of his earlier works was a century of Sacred Emblems (printed about 1591) in Latin, with English rendering. A rare book now, it was popular and may have influenced John Bunyan in the imagery to be found in Pilgrim's Progress. Other productions of Willet were mainly passing contributions to contemporary questions of the hour. Several of his works were translated into Dutch.

A special licence was granted to another son, Paul, in 1630, for a reprint of the Synopsis Papismi. The fourth son, Thomas Willet, was the first mayor of New York.

Filmed in London, it was written by Craig Warner and directed by Michael Samuels. It was shown as part of the BBC's \\"Aftershock\\" season, a selection of programmes marking the first anniversary of the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers. It featured James Cromwell, Ben Daniels, Corey Johnson, Michael Landes and James Bolam. Synopsis The Last Days of Lehman Brothers summarizes the events that occurred over the weekend preceding Monday, 15 September 2008, when Lehman declared bankruptcy. Some of the story is narrated by the fictional character \\"Zach\\", a Lehman employee often taking orders directly from Dick Fuld. Zach often breaks the Fourth wall, talking directly to the viewer. Investment bank Lehman Brothers is in trouble after a turbulent six months in which their real estate investments have lost billions of dollars, causing steep drops in Lehman's stock. Lehman's boss, Dick Fuld (Corey Johnson), who brought the firm through other crises, is himself growing desperate. Fuld's plan to spin off the company's bad assets into a separate company does not satisfy investors, and Lehman stock drops by 75% in one week. Fuld's only remaining solution is to have Lehman acquired. Both Bank of America and Barclays are interested in purchasing the firm but are dissuaded because so much of Lehman's assets are \\"toxic\\", worthless. Lehman's problems have put the US government in a delicate position. The collapse of a firm of Lehman's size would have catastrophic economic repercussions well beyond the firm itself. Because there is no political support for a government bailout of the firm, the government turns to Lehman's competitors for help. Late on the afternoon of 12 September, a Friday, the leaders of the top investment banks on Wall Street, Lehman's competitors, are summoned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. American Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson warns the incredulous group that Lehman is not too big to fail and that there will be no bailout using public money. Instead, Paulson cajoles the bank heads to work out some joint plan among themselves to relieve Lehman of its toxic assets, warning them that the steep price they would pay to save Lehman would be easily outweighed by the cost of its failure. He also intimidates the bank heads by reminding them that they too will soon need help. A solution must be found before trading opens in Japan on Monday morning. By Friday evening, Bank of America begins stalling the deal, noting that Lehman's valuation puts them \\"underwater\\" by billions of dollars. Fuld must now depend on Barclays, and he is clearly growing more desperate. Retaining hopes that Bank of America will change its mind, Fuld secretly orders the firm's attorney Harvey R. Miller (Richard Durden) begin drafting a bankruptcy petition. Miller is incredulous, telling Fuld that a Lehman bankruptcy would be an unprecedented catastrophe, akin to the United States government going bankrupt. As Paulson's group searches for alternatives, Lehman's assets are subject to \\"valuation\\" by analysts from other firms. The analysts spend the night poring over boxes of paperwork. Calculation is made extremely difficult because much of the assets are based on collateralized debt obligation (CDO) instruments whose value is difficult to assess, though it is clear that Lehman put a higher value on certain CDO's than other firms had. Overseeing the valuation, Zach mentions how the trafficking of subprime mortgages caused the economic crisis. The narration then shifts to Ezzy, Zach's sister back in Tennessee. Ezzy describes how she got her house by getting a mortgage from a broker who did not exhaustively check her financial papers, and used free software downloaded off the internet to alter her paychecks. Her mortgage was then sent to New York where other bankers packaged her mortgage and, along with other mortgages, turning it into a security that could be bought and sold. Successive bankers repackage and grade the securities, and actively trade them at enormous profit, but devote little attention to whether the homeowners themselves can pay their mortgages. Eventually the financial world is forced to acknowledge that their CDO's are based largely on mortgages like Ezzy's, causing their value to collapse. Discussion continues at the Fed throughout Saturday with little result. John Thain of Merrill Lynch (Ben Daniels) pulls out of Paulson's bailout group, telling Paulson that his company is in discussions with Bank of America. As they are no longer committed to Lehman, Bank of America is free to consider acquiring Merrill Lynch, which desperately needs the deal. Since the prospect of acquisition makes it less likely that Merrill will need help from the Fed, Thain has little incentive to continue participating in Paulson's discussions. Paulson doesn't discourage Thain from leaving, seeing that an acquisition of Merrill Lynch could prevent another crisis that would also require some intervention by the Fed. As Thain leaves, he learns from Paulson of the Fed's plans to bail out AIG, whose credit default swaps insure half of the western world's banking system. By Sunday morning, Fuld receives word that Barclays has agreed to acquire Lehman Brothers, saving it. Jubilation is short-lived. Under British law, Barclays cannot guarantee Lehman's debts until its own shareholders vote on the matter, and that will not happen until Tuesday ‚Äì beyond the Monday morning deadline. Paulson reiterates that the Fed will not \\"back-stop\\" Lehman, not even for the two days it will take for Barclays's shareholders to vote. With no chance of a buyout, Lehman has no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Harvey Miller is summoned to the Fed to prepare the bankruptcy petition. Miller is reluctant, warning Paulson that Lehman's assets exceed $600 billion. Paulson is adamant, telling Miller that he had been trying for months to get Dick Fuld to have Lehman acquired, but that the price was never high enough. Lehman's CFO signs the petition just minutes before the midnight deadline. A devastated Fuld leaves his office as Lehman's now unemployed staff cleans out their desks. In a voice-over, Zach notes that the Fed did bailout firms that faced collapse after Lehman.

The production is a work of fiction based on the real events that took place; the story was put together after watching interviews and with off-the-record chats with well-placed sources. It was completed in a short time frame; five weeks for scriptwriting, two for filming and five for editing. It was written by Craig Warner (writer of Maxwell and The Queen's Sister), directed by Michael Samuels (Caught in a Trap, The Curse of Steptoe) and produced by Lisa Osborne (Little Dorrit). Warner told ABCNews.com that he tried to make the film \\"fun and comprehensible\\" because \\"a bunch of white guys sitting around in suits talking about money isn't very interesting.\\" The fictional character of Zach (played by Michael Landes) was introduced as Fuld's aide, and Landes says that the voiceover he gives \\"brings an element of humor\\". Osborne said that the production was about much more than just finance: > It was a disaster movie, it was Apollo 13 with the titans of Wall Street > racing the clock to save the stricken bank; it was a Greek tragedy with > Lehman's chief executive brought down by his own tragic flaw; it was Twelve > Angry Men with solutions sought in smoke-filled rooms. Due to the low budget, locations in London were sought instead of those in New York. Locations included Addington Palace near Croydon which acted as the Federal Reserve, and a disused office in London's Canary Wharf which served as Fuld's New York office. Coincidentally, the office had previously been used by Lehman Brothers and desks originally used by the company were used to dress the set. Reception Overnight figures indicated that the production gained 1 million viewers, a 5% audience share, behind England's 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier on ITV1, Motorway Cops on BBC One and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA on Channel 4. Robert Epstein of The Independent on Sunday said it was \\"all very fast-moving\\" and that \\"ultimately, it was hard not to be bored by what was one of the most important ‚Äì and dramatic ‚Äì events of the past year. The end of Lehman ‚Äì and the programme ‚Äì couldn't come soon enough.\\" The Guardian's Sam Wollaston didn't think his boredom was entirely his fault, saying he found it \\"unengaging\\" and \\"a mess\\". Tim Teeman of The Times said that \\"some vivid performances transcended the baffling material\\" and John Preston of The Daily Telegraph said: > If I hadn‚Äôt read beforehand about how Last Days had been written and shot in > a tremendous hurry, I think I might have guessed. The tone wobbled awkwardly > at times, as did the focus. However, its faults were always faults of > ambition, not timidity. Craig Warner's script consistently aimed high, with > his boardroom exchanges being especially good: the chippy competitiveness > and testosterone surges slowly subsiding into stunned disbelief. Rachel Cooke in the New Statesman also said that Warner \\"tried his best\\" but that it was \\"dull and confusing in spite of a cast that included the superb James Cromwell\\". She also said that documentary The Love of Money about the Lehman Brothers collapse \\"wiped the floor\\" with The Last Days of Lehman Brothers, but Adam Sweeting said, comparing the drama and the documentary, that the latter \\"gives you a lot more numbers and facts, but rather less human insight.\\" See also *Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers * Too Big to Fail (film) References External links  Category:BBC television docudramas Category:British television films Category:British films Category:2009 television films ","title":"The Last Days of Lehman Brothers"},{"id":"24350563","text":"Douglas Stuart St John (26 February 1928 ‚Äì 11 July 1992) was a New Zealand first class cricketer who played for Otago and Wellington between 1946 and 1956. A right-handed batsman, St. John played 34 matches in total, scoring 1,236 runs at 20.94 with five half-centuries. Career Doug St John attended Otago Boys' High School, where he won the award for most improved player in the cricket team in his second-last year, 1944. He went on to study commerce at the University of New Zealand. St. John made his debut on 1 January 1947, against Auckland. Batting at six for Otago, he scored 28 and 31, and took two catches but could not stave off a one wicket defeat. He went on to play two more matches that season; scoring eight and eight not out against Wellington on 31 January, six and 25 in a drawn game against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 25 March. He ended his first season with 106 runs from three matches at 21.20, with a best of 31. At the start of the next season, St. John scored 85 and five not out against Wellington on Christmas Day. He would go on to play five matches in total, scoring a career-best 278 runs at 34.75, with two half centuries. He was selected to play for South Island in the match against North Island at the end of the season, scoring 47 and 63. His batting and sharp fielding in the match were noted, and he was named alongside John Reid as a promising player who might be selected to tour England in 1949. He struggled with the bat during the next few seasons, scoring only 102 runs during 1948/49 at 20.40 with a best of 53, and 117 during 1950/51 at 16.71, followed by 92 runs at 13.13 and 146 runs at 18.25 during his first two seasons at Wellington. He improved, however, during the 1954/55 season, where he scored 213 runs at 21.30, including a career-best 88. This came against Central Districts on 7 January 1955. Opening the batting - as he often did after moving to Wellington - St. John's 88 was bettered only by Test cricketer John Reid's 106 as Wellington pursued Central District's first innings score of 183 all out. St. John made 15 more runs in the second innings as Wellington reached victory by four wickets. The following season was to be his last, however, and saw St. John play five matches, scoring 182 runs at 20.22 with a best of 52 - his only half century of the season, which came in his final match. He bowed out on 10 February 1956, against a touring West Indies side that included Garfield Sobers. St. John scored his 52 in the first innings before being caught by Sobers, and made 19 as Wellington were forced to follow on and fell to an innings defeat.

Padhye is regarded as one of the foremost writers to have emerged in not just modern Marathi literature but also Indian literature, at large. Dilip Chitre once commented that Padhye is a writer \\"who deserves a permanent place in World Literature\\". During his lifetime, Padhye had a long ending tussle with publication of his books. Nevertheless, his novels Barrister Aniruddha Dhopeshvarkar, Vasunaka, Rada are regarded as classics of modern Marathi literature. Padhye was also known for his short stories. A collection of his short stories was edited by Dilip Chitre. Another collection of his selected short stories was edited by Rajan Gavas. His third published novel Vasunaka (Devanagari: ‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§®‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ) polarized critics in Maharashtra. Writers including Vijay Tendulkar, Durga Bhagwat hailed the novel for its originality and its portrayal of humanism. On the other hand, critics like Acharya Atre shamed the novel for its vulgarity. Padhye graduated in Economics from the University of Mumbai in 1948. During 1949-51, he worked as a full-time volunteer for a labour union. He worked next as a teacher in King George High-school at Dadar, L. Kaduri High School at Mazgaon, and B. S. Ezikel High School at Sandhurst Road, all in Mumbai, for a year each. Then he worked for four years as a clerk in Spring Mill at Wadala in Mumbai before starting his career as a journalist, sequentially in Hind Mazdoor, Nava Kal, and Nava Shakti dailies. His columns were published in different Marathi magazines, including Rahasyaranjan, Abhiruchee, Manoos, Sobat, Dinank, Kridangan, and Chandrayug. In 1989, Padhye suffered an attack of paralysis.

He is conducting research at the Faculty of Chemistry, University of M√ºnster.  Academic career  After his studies in chemistry at the University of G√∂ttingen from 1958 to 1963 and after his diploma in chemistry in 1963, Bernt Krebs received his Dr. rer.nat. degree in 1965. In 1965 and 1966 he worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at Brookhaven National Laboratory with Walter Hamilton and Don Koenig. After his habilitation in the field of inorganic chemistry at the University of G√∂ttingen he got tenure as a Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Kiel in 1971. In 1973 he followed a call as a Professor at the newly founded University of Bielefeld where he was successful in establishing a new chemistry department and new chemistry curricula. During his full professorship of inorganic chemistry at the University of M√ºnster since 1977, he established his group as an internationally recognized research centre in the field of coordination chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry and structural chemistry. His research covers a broad range of fields ranging from inorganic solid state chemistry, synthetic main group chemistry, biomimetic transition metal complex chemistry for modelling active sites in metalloproteins to metalloenzyme studies, including the isolation and structural characterization by X-ray diffraction analysis. During the 1960s and 1970s he was one of the pioneers in the field of chemical crystallography in Germany. His work in synthesis and spectroscopy involved close cooperation with Achim M√ºller. He has held guest professorships at the Universities of Stony Brook (US), Strasbourg (France), La Plata (Argentina), Copenhagen/Lyngby (Denmark), and Nagoya (Japan). Krebs has published more than 750 scientific peer-reviewed papers in international journals; besides a number of review articles, he was editor and co-editor of three books, and he is co-author of 13 patents. He served for several years in leading positions of German and European science organizations, e.g., as a chief referee (IC) for the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). Bernt Krebs is an elected member of several academies such as Academia Europaea London, Nationale Akademie der Wissenschaften Leopoldina), Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz, New York Academy of Sciences, and Academia Nacional de Sciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales, Buenos Aires. Among his several scientific honours are the Max Planck Research Award (1992), the Wilhelm Klemm Award of the German Chemical Society GDCh (1997), the Egon Wiberg Lecture Award (2003), and the honorary doctor degree of the University of Mainz (2006).  Research  Krebs' scientific achievements are centered in the fields of inorganic chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry, and structural chemistry. Starting with his thesis on trithiocarbonic acid and its chemistry, and supported by his profound experience gained during his postdoctoral work at Brookhaven National Laboratory, he was one of the pioneers of chemical crystallography in Germany in the sixties. In this context he was successful in his synthetic investigations on novel polynuclear metal-sulphur compounds, on chalcogen- halogen compounds and on transition metal oxo compounds which were supported by most innovative structural investigations with X-ray and neutron diffraction methods. In the field of physically relevant synthetic solid state chemistry he is internationally known for his pioneering development of boron- chalcogen chemistry. Besides novel binary and ternary boron-sulfur and boron- selenium compounds he developed new ionic conductors on the basis of lithium chalcogenoborates. His work in bioinorganic chemistry is centered mainly on investigations of the synthesis, structure and function of model compounds for metalloenzymes such as the purple acid phosphatases (iron, zinc), glucose isomerase (cobalt, zinc) and copper type-3 enzymes (catechol oxidase, tyrosinase). These investigations have led to catalytically active models as thermally stable and selective analogues for metalloenzymes. One of the achievements is the establishment of bio-analogous chemosensor systems for the analysis of catecholamines. Further investigations include a large number of mono- and polynuclear sulphur complexes of transition metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, zinc or molybdenum. They are significant contributions to the understanding of the function and structure of important metal-sulphur proteins such as ferredoxins, nitrogenases and metallothioneins. An important recent research project concerns the synthesis and practical development of novel platinum complexes as possible antitumor agents. Bernt Krebs was able to develop a number of highly interesting new compounds with promising properties, e.g., without nephrotoxic side effects. His structural investigations are significant contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms of the interaction of platinum agents with DNA. The contributions of Bernt Krebs to the methods and applications of crystal structure analysis with X-ray and neutron diffraction and to X-ray absorption spectroscopy are outstanding. His pioneering crystal structures of purple acid phosphatase from kidney bean and of catechol oxidase from sweet potatoes have become classical results of metalloenzyme research papers.

There are sometimes a few simple hairs pressed against the base of the leaf. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on glabrous stalks, sometimes S-shaped, long. There are 5 green, egg-shaped, tapering sepals which are long and glabrous on the outside but hairy on the inside surface. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The flower buds are orange on top, yellowish below and turn red as the flower opens with the petal tube having a lighter colour inside. Alternately, the buds may be pinkish to pale yellow turning light cream when they open. The flowers are sometimes spotted and pure white forms are known. The petal tube and lobes are glabrous apart from long white hairs on the base of the petal lobes and inside the tube. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube but shorten as the flower ages. Flowering occurs from March to December and the fruits which follow are fleshy at first, then dry, almost spherical, long and have a whitish-grey, spotted, papery covering. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in Stirpium Australasicarum Herbarii Hugeliani Decades Tres by botanist Stephan Endlicher in 1838 and given the name Stenochilus racemosus. The type specimen was collected by John Septimus Roe in the interior of Western Australia in December 1836. The species was transferred into the genus Eremophila by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859, with the change published in Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Van Diemen's Land. No further collections of the species were made until 1978. Robert Chinnock named the new collection Eremophila bicolor, unaware that it had been described more than 100 years earlier. The specific epithet (racemosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"full of clusters\\". Distribution and habitat Showy eremophila grows in loamy soils on undulating plains in the semi-arid zone north of Ravensthorpe, between Hyden and Norseman in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions. Until recently, the species was only known from small populations in disturbed areas such as roadsides but following widespread bushfires in 1992, populations of thousands were discovered. Conservation This species is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. Use in horticulture Showy eremophila is reasonably well known in horticulture, including in the United States and especially in California. It is fast-growing, with massed displays of bird-attracting flowers in spring but may only live for 8 to 10 years. It is usually propagated from cuttings and only takes a few weeks to develop roots. Well-drained soil in a sunny position is preferred but mature plants only need an occasional watering during a long drought. It is more tolerant of high humidity than most other eremophilas and can tolerate severe frosts, although temperatures below may cause some damage to new foliage. It can suffer wind damage and may need support.

(2011) Distributional analysis with L-moment statistics using the R environment for statistical computing, Create Space Independent Publishing Platform, [print-on-demand], They are linear combinations of order statistics (L-statistics) analogous to conventional moments, and can be used to calculate quantities analogous to standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis, termed the L-scale, L-skewness and L-kurtosis respectively (the L-mean is identical to the conventional mean). Standardised L-moments are called L-moment ratios and are analogous to standardized moments. Just as for conventional moments, a theoretical distribution has a set of population L-moments. Sample L-moments can be defined for a sample from the population, and can be used as estimators of the population L-moments. Population L-moments For a random variable X, the rth population L-moment is : \\\\lambda_r = r^{-1} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1} {(-1)^k \\\\binom{r-1}{k} \\\\mathrm{E}X_{r-k:r}}, where Xk:n denotes the kth order statistic (kth smallest value) in an independent sample of size n from the distribution of X and \\\\mathrm{E} denotes expected value. In particular, the first four population L-moments are : \\\\lambda_1 = \\\\mathrm{E}X : \\\\lambda_2 = (\\\\mathrm{E}X_{2:2} - \\\\mathrm{E}X_{1:2})/2 : \\\\lambda_3 = (\\\\mathrm{E}X_{3:3} - 2\\\\mathrm{E}X_{2:3} + \\\\mathrm{E}X_{1:3})/3 : \\\\lambda_4 = (\\\\mathrm{E}X_{4:4} - 3\\\\mathrm{E}X_{3:4} + 3\\\\mathrm{E}X_{2:4} - \\\\mathrm{E}X_{1:4})/4. Note that the coefficients of the k-th L-moment are the same as in the k-th term of the binomial transform, as used in the k-order finite difference (finite analog to the derivative). The first two of these L-moments have conventional names: :\\\\lambda_1 = \\\\text{mean, L-mean or L-location}, :\\\\lambda_2 = \\\\text{L-scale}. The L-scale is equal to half the mean difference. Sample L-moments The sample L-moments can be computed as the population L-moments of the sample, summing over r-element subsets of the sample \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x_1 < \\\\cdots < x_j < \\\\cdots < x_r \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, hence averaging by dividing by the binomial coefficient: : \\\\lambda_r = r^{-1}{\\\\tbinom{n}{r}}^{-1} \\\\sum_{x_1 < \\\\cdots < x_j < \\\\cdots < x_r} {(-1)^{r-j} \\\\binom{r-1}{j} x_j}. Grouping these by order statistic counts the number of ways an element of an n-element sample can be the jth element of an r-element subset, and yields formulas of the form below. Direct estimators for the first four L-moments in a finite sample of n observations are: :\\\\ell_1 = {\\\\tbinom{n}{1}}^{-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{(i)} :\\\\ell_2 = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} {\\\\tbinom{n}{2}}^{-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\tbinom{i-1}{1} - \\\\tbinom{n-i}{1} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} x_{(i)} :\\\\ell_3 = \\\\tfrac{1}{3} {\\\\tbinom{n}{3}}^{-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\tbinom{i-1}{2} - 2\\\\tbinom{i-1}{1}\\\\tbinom{n-i}{1} + \\\\tbinom{n-i}{2} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} x_{(i)} :\\\\ell_4 = \\\\tfrac{1}{4} {\\\\tbinom{n}{4}}^{-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\tbinom{i-1}{3} - 3\\\\tbinom{i-1}{2}\\\\tbinom{n-i}{1} + 3\\\\tbinom{i-1}{1}\\\\tbinom{n-i}{2} - \\\\tbinom{n-i}{3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} x_{(i)} where is the th order statistic and \\\\tbinom{\\\\cdot}{\\\\cdot} is a binomial coefficient. Sample L-moments can also be defined indirectly in terms of probability weighted moments, which leads to a more efficient algorithm for their computation. NIST Dataplot documentation L-moment ratios A set of L-moment ratios, or scaled L-moments, is defined by :\\\\tau_r = \\\\lambda_r / \\\\lambda_2, \\\\qquad r=3,4, \\\\dots. The most useful of these are \\\\tau_3, called the L-skewness, and \\\\tau_4, the L-kurtosis. L-moment ratios lie within the interval (‚Äì1, 1). Tighter bounds can be found for some specific L-moment ratios; in particular, the L-kurtosis \\\\tau_4 lies in [-¬º,1), and :\\\\tfrac{1}{4}(5\\\\tau_3^2-1) \\\\leq \\\\tau_4 < 1. A quantity analogous to the coefficient of variation, but based on L-moments, can also be defined: \\\\tau = \\\\lambda_2 / \\\\lambda_1, which is called the \\"coefficient of L-variation\\", or \\"L-CV\\". For a non-negative random variable, this lies in the interval (0,1) and is identical to the Gini coefficient. Related quantities L-moments are statistical quantities that are derived from probability weighted moments (PWM) which were defined earlier (1979). PWM are used to efficiently estimate the parameters of distributions expressable in inverse form such as the Gumbel, the Tukey, and the Wakeby distributions. Usage There are two common ways that L-moments are used, in both cases analogously to the conventional moments: # As summary statistics for data. # To derive estimators for the parameters of probability distributions, applying the method of moments to the L-moments rather than conventional moments. In addition to doing these with standard moments, the latter (estimation) is more commonly done using maximum likelihood methods; however using L-moments provides a number of advantages. Specifically, L-moments are more robust than conventional moments, and existence of higher L-moments only requires that the random variable have finite mean. One disadvantage of L-moment ratios for estimation is their typically smaller sensitivity. For instance, the Laplace distribution has a kurtosis of 6 and weak exponential tails, but a larger 4th L-moment ratio than e.g. the student-t distribution with d.f.=3, which has an infinite kurtosis and much heavier tails. As an example consider a dataset with a few data points and one outlying data value. If the ordinary standard deviation of this data set is taken it will be highly influenced by this one point: however, if the L-scale is taken it will be far less sensitive to this data value. Consequently, L-moments are far more meaningful when dealing with outliers in data than conventional moments. However, there are also other better suited methods to achieve an even higher robustness than just replacing moments by L-moments. One example of this is using L-moments as summary statistics in extreme value theory (EVT). This application shows the limited robustness of L-moments, i.e. L-statistics are not resistant statistics, as a single extreme value can throw them off, but because they are only linear (not higher-order statistics), they are less affected by extreme values than conventional moments. Another advantage L-moments have over conventional moments is that their existence only requires the random variable to have finite mean, so the L-moments exist even if the higher conventional moments do not exist (for example, for Student's t distribution with low degrees of freedom). A finite variance is required in addition in order for the standard errors of estimates of the L-moments to be finite. Some appearances of L-moments in the statistical literature include the book by David & Nagaraja (2003, Section 9.9) and a number of papers. A number of favourable comparisons of L-moments with ordinary moments have been reported. Values for some common distributions The table below gives expressions for the first two L-moments and numerical values of the first two L-moment ratios of some common continuous probability distributions with constant L-moment ratios. More complex expressions have been derived for some further distributions for which the L-moment ratios vary with one or more of the distributional parameters, including the log-normal, Gamma, generalized Pareto, generalized extreme value, and generalized logistic distributions. { style=\\"text-align:center;\\" |- !

Extensions Trimmed L-moments are generalizations of L-moments that give zero weight to extreme observations. They are therefore more robust to the presence of outliers, and unlike L-moments they may be well-defined for distributions for which the mean does not exist, such as the Cauchy distribution.

Formal music education begins at 4¬Ω years and can progress as high as postgraduate studies. Education in Scotland is a responsibility of the Scottish Government. Music is regarded as being an integral part of the culture of Scotland. Music service Music services are working in almost all state schools and provide much of their instruction during the regular school day. Most of them offer instrumental tuition for pupils in their schools. On average one instrumental / vocal lesson lasts from 30 minutes and is usually given once a week. A primary school is usually limited in the numbers of pupils they provide lessons to and lessons usually comprise a small group of 2 to 4 children. Most independent (fee-paying) schools work on a similar basis to the above. Some independent schools such as Loretto School also give music scholarships. Centres of excellence Scotland has six centres of excellence ‚Äì schools which allow gifted children to maximise their potential (four for music and one each for dance and sport). These schools select a small number of pupils who show a special ability in music. Admission is by audition. The schools are located within comprehensive schools from which they receive normal academic classes. Students are attracted from within the local region and even nationally. The music schools comprise: *Douglas Academy Music School at Douglas Academy, Milngavie, near Glasgow *Aberdeen City Music School at Dyce Academy Aberdeen *Sgoil Chi√πil na G√†idhealtachd (National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music) at Plockton High School Highland *City of Edinburgh Music School at Broughton High School, Edinburgh and Flora Stevenson Primary, Edinburgh. The number of music students is relatively small in comparison with the host school. Secondary students at the City of Edinburgh Music school are 30-40 compared to 1,000 within the host High School, and of the 1,000 students of Douglas Academy, around 50 are music specialists. Typically, music students receive individual instrument lessons, theory and practice time within the music school. The City of Edinburgh Music School is the only 'centre of excellence' which directly operates within a primary school. The schools are funded by the Local Education Authority within which they are located. Douglas Academy Music School, Aberdeen City Music School and the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music all have Halls of Residence, and so are able to accommodate students from across Scotland. Specialist music school St Mary's Music School is an independent (private) specialist music school in Edinburgh, Scotland, for children aged 9‚Äì18. The school offers education to musically talented children and is the only specialist full-time music school in Scotland. Overview of the musical pre-college phase in the United Kingdom , retrieved 2009-10-20 History of the Music and Dance Scheme , retrieved 2009-10-20 In addition to their main studies, students receive intensive instruction on a solo instrument and a program of music according to their age. This includes ear training, chamber music, chorus, composition, jazz and music technology. Entry is solely by audition. Successful applicants receive financial support through the Scottish Government‚Äôs Aided Places Scheme. Students combine both academic and music studies within the school. The school is also the choir school of St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral and all its 70 students are either instrumentalists or choristers. It attracts its pupils nationally, from the rest of the UK and abroad. St Mary's is a member of the UK Music and Dance Excellence (MADE) Schools Music and Dance Excellence Schools , retrieved 2009-10-20 and is within the tradition of other specialist music schools throughout Europe such as the Dresden Music Gymnasium; S√§chsisches Landesgymnasium f√ºr Musik \\"Carl Maria von Weber\\" or the Yehudi Menuhin School, England. Private tuition Amateur or Private Schools of Music offers music education outside the general education system for students aged 4 to 20 + years. In general, students attend these schools, weekend or evening. The schools are, for example those provided by individuals, charitable or commercial organizations. Examples include the North East of Scotland Music School, Portobello Music School, Dunbar Music School and Yamaha Music School. In addition qualified teachers provide musical training outside of an establishment or the mainstream education system for pupils aged 4 to 20+ years. The objective of education varies from amateur to training (pre-) professional music training, according to the personal ambitions of students. Universities and colleges A number of universities have music departments and offer degrees in music ‚Äî Bachelor, Master and Doctorate. They may be performance related and/or music theory which can be combined with other subjects, or they may be hybrid courses incorporating performance along with business and entrepreneurial skills. Scottish universities offering degrees include: *University of Glasgow, Glasgow established 1451 *University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen established 1495 *University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh established 1583 *University of Strathclyde, Glasgow incorporated as university 1964, established 1796 *Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh incorporated as university 1992, established 1964 *University of the West of Scotland, Ayr *University of the Highlands and Islands, Inverness There are a number of colleges offering popular and contemporary music courses in Scotland at NQ, National Certificate, Higher National Certificate and Higher National Diploma level. Many of these courses may specialise within a particular area of music, such as the Electronic Music and Recording course at Clydebank College. Scottish colleges offering these courses include: *Ayrshire College *Dundee and Angus College *Edinburgh College *Forth Valley College *Glasgow Clyde College *Glasgow Kelvin College *Lews Castle College *New College Lanarkshire *North East Scotland College *North Highland College *Perth College UHI *West College Scotland Conservatoire The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (RCS), formerly known as the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, is Scotland‚Äôs conservatoire of music, theatre and dance. Although there is some overlap with the music departments of Universities, the Conservatoire seeks to be practical and focuses on career development. In 1993, as the RSAMD, it was first in the United Kingdom which was granted to give their own degrees. Research degrees are validated by the University of St Andrews. Junior conservatoire The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland operates a Junior Conservatoire, with classes on Saturdays during term-time.

It is operated by JR Kyushu and is on the Sasebo Line. Lines The station is served by the Sasebo Line and is located 21.5 km from the starting point of the line at . Only local services on the Sasebo Line stop at this station.  Station layout  The station consists of two side platforms serving two tracks (track 1 and track 3). Track 2 is a through-track which runs between the other two and a siding branches off track 1. The station building is a timber structure which used to house a ticket window but has become unstaffed and presently serves only as a waiting room. Access to the opposite side platform is by means of a footbridge. Adjacent stations History The private Kyushu Railway had opened a track from to and Takeo (today ) by 5 May 1895. In the next phase of expansion, the track was extended further west with Haiki opening as the new western terminus on 10 July 1897. Mimasaka was opened on the same day as an intermediate station on the new track. When the Kyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1907, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. On 12 October 1909, track from Tosu through Mimasaka and Haiki to Nagasaki was designated the Nagasaki Main Line. On 1 December 1934, another route was given the designation Nagasaki Main Line and the official starting point of the Sasebo Line was moved from Haiki to . As such Mimasaka now became part of the Sasebo Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu. The station became unstaffed in 2016. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 353 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 286th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.

The forecast as of 2016 was to produce a total of 2.8 million vehicles from which about 80% is for export. During the first half of 2016, with exports valued over 24,000 million euros over that period, the automotive industry accounted for 18.9% of the total Spanish exports. In 2016, the automotive industry was generating 8.7 percent of Spain's gross domestic product, employing about nine percent of workers in the manufacturing industry. In all, there are 13 car factories located in Spain. which are supported by a thriving local car components industry, including rapidly growing Spanish multinationals such as Gestamp Automoci√≥n and Grupo Antolin. More than two million car engines are manufactured in Spain every year. The main manufacturers established in the country are Daimler AG (manufacturing plant in Vitoria), Ford (its plant located in Almussafes is Ford's biggest in Europe), Opel (Figueruelas), Nissan (Barcelona), PSA Peugeot Citroen (Vigo), Renault (with plants in Palencia and other Spanish locations), SEAT (Martorell), Volkswagen (Pamplona). From these production plants, as of 2016 the two biggest by volume are the ones of SEAT in Martorell and PSA in Vigo. Historical development Early Spanish manufacturers included the well known luxury car manufacturer Hispano-Suiza, originally founded as \\"La Cuadra\\" in 1898, and smaller companies such as Elizalde and Ricart. Foreign makers started to set up local assembly subsidiaries in the 1920s, with Ford Motor Ib√©rica opening its C√°diz premises in 1920 and General Motors Peninsular in M√°laga in 1927. By 1936, the industry had reached a significant volume, and was in continuous growth and modernisation. The Spanish Civil War interrupted this development, and the decade of economic isolation that followed made it very difficult for it to resume. In the mid 1940s, a number of home-grown companies started to emerge, led by Enasa, a state-owned conglomerate built around the remains of Hispano-Suiza, with brands like Pegaso or Sava. Things started to change for the Spanish car industry in the 1960s when an industrial policy was launched with measures which contributed the Spanish miracle. In the years from 1958 to 1972 the sector grew at a yearly compound rate of 21.7%; in 1946 there were 72,000 private cars in Spain, in 1966 there were 1 million.J.L. Garc√≠a Ruiz, \\"Barreiros Diesel y el desarrolo de la automoci√≥n en Espa√±a\\" . This growth rate had no equal in the world. The icon of the time was the SEAT 600 car, produced by the Spanish company SEAT. More than 794,000 of them were made between 1957 and 1973, and if at the beginning of this period it was the first car for many Spanish working-class families, at its end it was the first second one for many more. Later on, in the 1980s the Spanish automotive flagship, SEAT, was sold to the Volkswagen group, but by then the manufacturing cluster had already been consolidated and other international manufacturers were already producing in Spain.  Spanish brands   Present Spanish brands   GTA Spano   Hurtan   IFR Aspid   SEAT  SEAT is the sole active Spanish brand with a mass production potential and capability of developing its own models in-house. Today it operates as a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, formed in 1950 by the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI) and six Spanish banks with FIAT assistance, under a name that stands for Sociedad Espa√±ola de Autom√≥viles de Turismo (Spanish Saloon/Sedan Car Company). In 1953 the company produced their first model, the SEAT 1400. This 44 hp (33 kW) four-door saloon car had a top speed of 75 mph (120 km/h). When production ceased in 1964 over 98,000 had been made. Models produced licensed by FIAT in the 1960s include the 600, 850, 1500 and 124. 815,319 of the 800 models were made between 1964 and 1967. SEAT produced its one millionth car in 1968. By 2003 this figure had risen to more than 14 million. During the 1970s SEAT produced the 67 hp (50 kW) 1200 model (1975 to 1980) and over 1.5 million 131 models (1974 to 1984). The SEAT 1200 Sport was a 2-door coup√© produced by SEAT from 1975 to 1979. The car was known as the \\"Bocanegra\\" because of the shape of its always black plastic nose panel, which embraced the front grille and the headlights and incorporated, by 1970s standards, a prominent front bumper. \\"Boca negra\\" means \\"black mouth\\" in Spanish. Other models produced at this time include the 127, 128, 132, 133 and the Ritmo. FIAT‚Äôs assistance ended in 1981 and was replaced by a cooperation agreement with the Volkswagen Group in 1982. Up to 1981 most SEAT cars resembled FIAT models. The 1982 Ronda model was the first car produced by SEAT without assistance from FIAT. SEAT became a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group in 1986. Other cars produced during the 1980s include the Fura (1981‚Äì86), Marbella (1986‚Äì98), M√°laga (1985‚Äì92) and Ibiza. The Marbella was a re-badged Fiat Panda, while the Giugiaro styled Ibiza (launched in 1984) was the company's first new product after the split from FIAT. The Malaga was the saloon version of the Ibiza, but the Ibiza was far more popular. Models produced between 1990 and 2007 include the Arosa, Le√≥n, C√≥rdoba, Toledo, Alhambra and the Altea. In 2008 the company introduced the 1.4-litre, 170 hp (127 kW) Bocanegra (4th generation Ibiza) concept car. The Ibiza was in its fourth generation by 2008. The Toledo, launched in 1991, was SEAT's first large family car since its split from FIAT. The Cordoba, which ran between 1993 and 2008, was the saloon version of the second and third generation Ibiza hatchbacks, and was slightly more popular than the earlier Malaga. The Alhambra was SEAT's first MPV, launched in 1996 and based on the Volkswagen Sharan and Ford Galaxy. The Leon, launched in 1999, was a small family hatchback aimed at the likes of the Ford Focus and Opel Astra. SEAT's replacement for the long-running Marbella was the SEAT Arosa, launched in 1997; it formed the basis of the Volkswagen Lupo which was launched over a year later. 2009 models include the Le√≥n Mk2, C√≥rdoba Mk2, Toledo Mk3, Alhambra Mk1, Ibiza Mk4 and Altea and the new flagship sedan model Exeo. The Exeo being derived from the Audi A4, shares the same fundamental powertrain layout and platform. Until the mid 1980s, SEAT cars were rarely seen outside Spain, but have since become popular in many export markets, including Britain, where sales began in the autumn of 1985. Just under 6,000 SEATs were sold in Britain in 1986, the company's first full year of trading there, exceeding 10,000 sales in 1988 and exceeding 20,000 a year by 2000, peaking at more than 45,000 in 2013.  Sunred   Tauro Sport Auto   Tramontana   Historic Spanish brands   Abadal  Francisco Abadal, who used to work for Hispano-Suiza, produced two luxury models between 1912 and 1923. They were fitted with either a 3,104cc four-cylinder engine or a 4,521 cc six-cylinder engine. From about 1917 Buick engines were fitted and these cars were called Abadal- Buicks. Approximately 170 Imperia-Abadals were built in Belgium, including a 2,992 cc sports model.  Authi  The Authi Car Company, which was formed in 1965, was the result of a collaboration agreement between Nueva Montana Quijano and the British Motor Corporation. The company produced the following models: Authi Mini (1968‚Äì1975), Authi Mini Cooper (1973‚Äì1975), Morris 1100/1300 (1966‚Äì1972), Austin Victoria (1972‚Äì1975) and the Austin de Luxe (1974‚Äì1975). In 1976 the company was purchased by the SEAT Car Company.  Barreiros  Barreiros-Dodge 3700 made in Spain. The company was founded in 1954 as Barreiros Diesel S.A and initially it produced diesel engines. In 1963 a licensing agreement was reached with Chrysler to build the Dodge Dart in Spain. Between 1965 and 1977 a total of 17,589 Barreiros Darts were produced. These were based on the Dodge Dart GL, the Dodge Dart GT (‚Äúsporty\\" version) and the Dodge 3700GT (using the body of the argentinian Dodge Polara/Coronado). A diesel version called the ‚ÄúBarreiros Diesel\\" was also produced. In 1969 Chrysler Europe took over the company. From the mid-1970s Barreiros started manufacturing the Chrysler 180 and later the Simca 1307 (called the Chrysler 150 in Spain) and the Simca Horizon. In 1978, PSA Peugeot Citro√´n purchased Chrysler Europe and former models were renamed; the Chrysler 150 becoming the Talbot 150. Barreiros later produced the Talbot Solara and Talbot Samba.  Biscuter  In the late 1940s Gabriel Voisin (French) designed a small car called the Biscooter. The license to build the vehicle was obtained by Autonacional S.A. The first Biscuter car was launched in Spain in 1953 and was called the Series 100 or the Zapatilla (little shoe). The original models did not have doors, windows or a reverse gear. It was powered by a one-cylinder, 197 cc, two-stroke 9 hp (7 kW) engine which supplied power only to the right front wheel. The Bisc√∫ter car was produced for about ten years.  Elizalde  In 1909 Arturo Elizalde Rouvier started a company was called \\"Sociedad Mercantil J. M. Vallet y Cia\\" to manufacturer car parts. A prototype called the Tipo 11 was launched in mid-1914. In 1915, King Alfonso XIII owned a 20cv Biada-Elizalde cabriolet Tipo 20. A 25cv sports version of the Tipo 20 was produced in 1919 as the Reine Victoria (name of the Queen consorts). It is believed to be the first Spanish car to feature four-wheel brakes. In 1920 the company started production of the four-cylinder, 3,817 cc, Model 29. Variants of this model were built until 1927. Production of the 8,143 cc straight-eight model, known as the Tipo 48, also began in 1920. The car had a built in tire pump which could also be used as a vacuum cleaner. A 5,181 cc straight-eight Gran Sport version of the Tipo 48 model, capable of 100 mph (160 km/h), was also produced. Production of Elizalde cars ceased in 1928.  ENASA  ENASA sort of (Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A.) was a Spanish truck manufacturing company, incorporated in 1946 having bought the automotive assets of the Spanish arm of Hispano-Suiza. It produced trucks, buses sport- cars and military armored vehicles under the Pegaso brand and, for a short while, Sava brands. Pegaso built about a hundred high-end Z-102 sports cars in the 1950s. The cars were in many ways advanced for the time, as they had all- wheel independent suspension, a five-speed gearbox, very powerful supercharged engines, and were offered with the choice of Touring, Saoutchik, Serra or Enasa's own luxury bodies. Enasa belonged to the state-owned INI industrial holding. In 1990 Enasa was sold to Fiat S.p.A. - Iveco.  Eucort  The Eugenio Cortes SA (company) manufactured cars from 1945 to 1951.Or 1953? The first Eucort model, which was based on a pre World War II Germany Dampf Kraft Wagen (DKW) design, was fitted with 764 cc twin-cylinder two-stroke engine. Four-door sedan and a three-door estate versions were available. In 1950 the company started production of its final model, the two-stroke 1,034 cc Victoria. By the time the company ceased car production in 1951 (1953?) about 1,500 Eucort cars (including taxis) had been built.  Hispano-Suiza  Hispano-Suiza 1924 H6B ultra-luxurious automobile. In 1898 Emilio de la Cuadra started a company in Barcelona called ‚ÄúLa Cuadra‚Äù to produce electric cars. Four years later it was acquired by J. Castro. He changed the name to ‚ÄúF√°brica Hispano-Suiza de Autom√≥viles‚Äù (Spanish-Swiss Car Factory). By the end of 1903 this company went bankrupt, re-emerging in 1904 as ‚ÄúLa Hispano-Suiza F√°brica de Autom√≥viles‚Äù. In 1906 Hispano-Suiza produced two models of 3.8 and 7.4 litres. Between 1907 and 1914 the company mass-produced a range of cars, plus a number of hand-built racing models, including the Type A (1907), Type 15 (1910) and the four-cylinder 3,620 cc Alphonse XIII (1911‚Äì14). In 1911 a factory called ‚ÄúHispano France‚Äù was established just outside Paris, moving to another location in 1914, when they took the name \\"Hispano-Suiza‚Äù. The Stork statuette fitted on top of each car‚Äôs radiator was based on the squadron emblem painted on the side of the aircraft used by a World War I French ace, who owned a Hispano-Suiza car. The Hispano-Suiza H6 range was introduced in 1919. It was mainly built at the Paris factory. A few model built in Spain were called the T41. About 2,350 of these ultra-luxury models were made up to 1933; the 6,597 cc H6B (1919‚Äì32), and H6C (1926‚Äì33). Between 1924 and 1927 about 50 H6Bs were built under license by Skoda of Czechoslovakia. The H6 was one of the first cars to be fitted with power-assisted brakes and originally came with a 6.5-litre engine. An 8-litre engine was fitted to the H6C model. In 1923 the French part of Hispano-Suiza became known as the Societ√© Fran√ßaise Hispano-Suiza . The 8-litre T56 model was produced from 1928, plus a 3,750 cc T49 model. Other models produced in Spain the 1920s include the 4.7-litre T30 4.7 (1914‚Äì24) and the 3,089 cc T16 (1921‚Äì24). In 1930 Hispano-Suiza took over Ballot, the French car manufacturer. The six-cylinder 4,580cc Junior model was produced from about 1930 to 1934. It was replaced by the 5.1-litre K6 (1934‚Äì37). The 9,425 cc Type 68, which was produced in 1931, later evolved into an 11,310 cc version. A six-cylinder version, the K6, succeeded the Junior in 1934. During the 1930s the company produced a range of luxury cars, including the 4.5-litre HS26 (1932), the 9.4-litre and 11.3-litre J12 model (1932‚Äì38) The last model produced by the company in Spain was the T6ORL. The car was produced from 1934 to about 1943. After the Second World War, Hispano- Suiza France was primarily an aerospace firm. from 1955 Their attention turned increasingly to jet engine manufacturing and, in 1968, they became a division of SNECMA. In 1999, they moved their turbine engines operations to a new factory in Bezons, outside of Paris, using the original factories for power transmissions and accessory systems for jet engines. In 2005, SNECMA merged with SAGEM to form SAFRAN. In Spain the Hispano-Suiza company sold in 1946 their automotive assets to ‚ÄúEmpresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A‚Äù (Enasa), a Spanish vehicle manufacturing company. It has become Pegaso brand.  Kapi  Autom√≥viles y Autoscooter Kapi produced cars from 1950 to 1955. The first model was a three-wheeled two-door car that was powered by a 125 cc single- cylinder two-stroke engine. Other models include the Chiqui, a three-wheeler with single wheel at the rear, the Platillo Volante, a four-wheel coup√© and the M190 with miniature Mercedes 190 body.  Bus manufacturing  Spain has the largest number of independent coachbuilders in Europe, producing bespoke models for the international market. Contrary to the large European bus manufacturers, who build their buses as standard models on an integral chassis, most Spanish manufacturers build a bodywork on a chassis supplied by a third party, allowing for a large variety of designs. As of December 2017, active coachbuilders include: * Ayats * Beulas * Burilla * Car-bus.net * Castrosua * Ferqui * Indcar * Integralia * Irizar * Nogebus * Obradors * Sunsundegui * Unvi * Vectia  Multinational subsidiaries  Many foreign car and truck makers - like Volkswagen, Nissan, Daimler AG, Ford, Renault, Opel, PSA Peugeot/Citro√´n, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles-Iveco etc. - as well as suppliers have facilities and plants in Spain today developing and producing vehicles and components, not only for the needs of the internal market but also for exportation purposes,Anfac asociados with the contribution of the automobile industry in 2008 rising up to the second place with 17,6% out of the country's total exports. Ford opened a factory at Valencia in 1976 to build its new European supermini, the Fiesta, which is still being built there 40 years and several incarnations later, although it has also been built in Britain and Germany. The Escort and Orion were also built there in the 1980s and 1990s, as was the Ka from 1996 until 2008, when production of its successor was switched to the Fiat factory in Poland. The Escort's successor, the Focus was produced at the Valencia plant from 1998 until 2011, since when all European production of the third generation Focus has been concentrated in Germany. The C-Max version of the third generation Focus, however, was built there from 2010 until 2014. The factory also hosted production of a Mazda model, the Mazda 2, from 2002 to 2007, as part of Ford's venture with the Japanese carmaker. Nissan has been building cars in Spain at its Barcelona factory since 1983. The first model to be produced there was the Patrol four- wheel drive. It current builds several model ranges for the passenger car and commercial vehicle markets, the most recent addition being the Pulsar family hatchback in 2014. Renault set up a production facility at Valladolid in 1951, producing some of its French made products for the Spanish market. The Spanish production of some Renault models originally took place under the FASA-Renault banner, and from 1974 to 1984 the company actually built its own saloon version of the hugely successful Renault 5 hatchback, which was known as the Renault 7, and was only built at the Valladolid plant. Nearly 160,000 R7's were sold, most of them on the Spanish market. The Spanish operations were rebranded Renault Espana from 2000. General Motors Europe opened a new factory at Zaragoza in 1982, for production of its new Corsa supermini - which was imported to the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Nova. Production of the Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra also commenced at Zaragoza in 1986. The Meriva was built there between its launch in 2003-2017. Volkswagen has concentrated production of its Polo supermini at SEAT's Barcelona plant since it bought the company in 1986. All versions of the SEAT Ibiza produced since 1993 have featured the same floorpan and engines as the Volkswagen Polo of that generation.
