Early life and education  Williams was born to an English- speaking, middle-class family of Brecknockshire. She was probably born in Oystermouth, Gower, although some sources say Aberclydach, Tal-y-bont on Usk, Brecknockshire. She was the fourth child of John James Williams, M.D. She had a sister, Gwenfreida; and two brothers, William and Frederick. In her youth, she came under the influence of Lady Llanover and her circle. From them Williams learned to speak Welsh and adopted the 'traditional' Welsh costume of dress, along with her brother Frederick who dressed like a 13th-century Welsh lord.  Career as a novelist  When she was 22, Williams published her first novel with her sister, Gwenfreida, under the name \\"Y Ddau Wynne\\". The novel, called One of the Royal Celts, is an idealised fictionalisation of the British Empire, in which Celtic valour is presented as the reason for the success of the empire. The novel's main character is Glynd≈µr Parry Lloyd, a man who can trace his ancestry back to the last Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd. There is not a single English character in the book. It has been argued that Gwenfrieda's political beliefs were the foundation of the novel. However, Williams went on to write and publish A Maid of Cymru, which is a romance, but again highly patriotic. Published in 1901, it was symbolically related to the failure of the campaign for Welsh home rule which was active at this time. This is shown by the death of the Tangwysh who was trampled to death by wild ponies. In 1926, along with her nephew Ioan Penry Brychan Robertson, she published the Welsh birthday book, Llyfr Penblwydd.  Political career  In 1896 Williams was the second person to join Urdd y Delyn, an organisation established by Owen M. Edwards to promote Welsh arts and culture. Urdd y Delyn offered prizes for harp playing, speaking Welsh, reading Welsh books and penillion singing. Under the pen name of \\"Gwobrywyon Aberclydach\\", Williams later presented prizes for harp playing at the national eisteddfodau. Between 1911 and 1916 Williams was central to the foundation of Byddin Cymru, a radical nationalist group concerned with protecting the Welsh language. The movement published its ideology in the pages of a magazine called Cymru'r Plant. She attended Irish and Welsh movement meetings zealously and could not be wavered on her stance for Welshness in dress and speech. In one of her annual addresses to Byddin Cymru, she urged the members to copy the zeal of the Irish, but after the 1916 Easter Rising, she was more subdued. Throughout her life she constantly supported Urdd Gobaith Cymru, Plaid Cymru and the National Eisteddfod. She was a supporter of the campaign against the establishment of the Royal Air Force Training Camps at Porth Neigwl and Penyberth, and it was she who gave then the nickname Ysgolion Formio 'bombing schools'. Williams was part of the Welsh home rule movement and the Cymru Fydd campaign.  Later years and legacy  In her later life, Williams gave a hundred pounds to supporters of the Welsh language and culture. In 1915 she moved to Plas Pantsaeson with her younger brother, Frederick, where she spent the rest of her life. She died there on 28 October 1950, near St Dogmaels. She was cremated at Pontypridd and her ashes were scattered in the churchyard at Llansanffraid, Brecknockshire. Williams influenced a new wave of women's writers along with Gwyneth Vaughan, a fellow activist and writer.

The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Historical context  By 1900 some sections of the single- track railway network in New South Wales were operating at or near saturation. These included The Great Zig Zag near , the Main West from Emu Plains to Bathurst, the Main South from Picton as far as Harden and the Main North between Maitland and Muswellbrook. Also, the metropolitan railways were congested due to the combination of suburban and freight traffic. The solution was a series of deviations to ease the gradients, and double tracks (duplications) to increase traffic capacity. The programme of duplications and deviations began around 1910 and was largely completed by 1922. Some sections were not completed until the 1950s.As part of the duplication and deviation works, new bridges were required, with the principal material for new bridges and culverts being bricks. Steel was an expensive option (requiring importation from Britain) whereas the use of bricks complied with a long- standing policy to use local materials as far as possible to contain costs. The establishment of the State Brickworks at in 1912 greatly increased the supply of bricks in the early 20th century. The period from 1910 to 1922 was dominated by the use of bricks. Thereafter, supplies of imported steel increased and BHP was able to meet local demands for structural steel products, resulting in the cessation of the use of bricks for the construction of railway bridges. On the Main West, deviation work began on both sides of the Blue Mountains in 1910, with the Glenbrook 1913 double-track deviation (1910-13) starting at Emu Plains, the Ten Tunnels Deviation of the Lithgow Zig Zag (1897-1910), and the section at Solitary Creek (from Rydal to Sodwalls) completed between 1910 and 1915.  Description  The complex consists of six stone single-track viaducts and bridges, dated from 1872 and 1916, either in use and extended for double line or abandoned on deviation in 1906.LEP. The physical condition of the complex was considered good, with some bridges and viaducts still in use for the carriage of passenger and freight rail. The single track Main Western Railway reached Sodwalls and Tarana in April 1872 along a more-or-less direct route from Rydal. This route involved a number of steep grades and crossings of Solitary Creek. Around 1906, a deviation was built where the line went in a longer route with reduced grades. The old route retains a number of viaducts, the longest ‚ÄúNo. 6 Viaduct‚Äù with four arches.  Heritage listing  Rydal rail underbridges was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare.

He survived an attempt to unseat him by the Ruler of Sharjah, with whom he later allied. He re-united Ras Al Khaimah with its secessionist dependencies.  Accession  On the accession of Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi as Ruler of Sharjah in 1868, following the death of his brother Khalid bin Sultan, Salim's nephew, Humaid bin Abdullah, assumed the role of wali of Ras Al Khaimah. In the following year he proclaimed independence from Sharjah. The machinations of the Saudi Agent resulted in an attempt to establish Humaid as Ruler of Sharjah, but this attempt ultimately failed, resulting in violence in Sharjah and the death of the gentleman concerned.  Coup attempt  In May 1869, Salim bin Sultan and his brother Ibrahim moved together against Humaid bin Abdullah with the intention of establishing Ibrahim as Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, landing 1,500 men from 32 boats. Humaid was supported by a force of some 500 men landed from Umm Al Qawain and fighting took place both at Jazirat Al Hamrah and in Ras Al Khaimah town. The British Resident, Colonel Lewis Pelly, on hearing of this breach of the maritime truce (the embarkation of troops in an act of war by sea breached the treaty) sailed from Lingeh in the Dalhousie with the gunboat Hugh Rose. Arriving at Ras Al Khaimah on the 12th May, Pelly then ordered Salim and Ibrahim to withdraw their forces from Ras Al Khaimah by sunset the next day. Alliances shifted quickly, however, and in 1871 Humaid bin Abdullah, together with the Ruler of Umm Al Qawain, supported Salim bin Sultan when he took advantage of Ibrahim's absence on a journey to Abu Dhabi and cemented his ascendancy by retaking total control of Sharjah. At the same time, Humaid bin Abdullah retook the dependencies of Sha'am, Rams and Shimal, which had managed to secede from his rule. An attempt by Sha'am to secede in 1885 resulted in Humaid extracting a fine of 1600 Marie Theresa Dollars. He died in 1900, his death resulting in the Ruler of Sharjah, Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi, taking over Ras Al Khaimah that same year.

In 2018 it was declared insolvent and bankrupt and placed under curatorship, with South African citizens and taxpayers defrauded out of roughly R2 billion (130 million USD). It was formed as Venda Building Society in 1982, and became a mutual bank in 1992. By 2016 the bank reportedly had around 30,000 depositors with all deposits in the bank totalling R800 million. In 2017 the bank planned to list on the South African Stock Exchange; however, this never materialized. Most of its branches and clients are located in Limpopo province.  History  Prior to 2014 the bank was relatively small and primarily involved in retail banking with many of its depositors consisting of burial societies and stokvels. The bank in turn issued mortgages and short term loans to its clients allowing them to use their property or banking deposits as collateral. The South African Public Investment Corporation inherited its shares in VBS bank when it succeeded the pension fund of the Venda bantustan government thereby giving it a 25% ownership stake in the bank. Largest shareholder in the bank was Dyambeu Investments which owned 26% of the bank, 51% of Dyambeu Investments was owned by the Venda Royal family. Prior to coming under curatorship in 2018 the bank gained notoriety in 2016 when it gave a R7.8 million loan to then President Jacob Zuma when he was ordered to repay the state for controversial improvements to his personal homestead at Nkandla. In mid-2018 the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) instructed municipalities to withdraw their deposits in the bank as the Municipal Finance Management Act prevented them from depositing public funds in mutual banks. This, along with mismanagement and corruption within the bank, created a liquidity crisis for the bank. The prudential authority filed for VBS bankruptcy at the North Gauteng High Court on 30 October 2018. On 13 November 2018 the North Gauteng High Court issued a final order to liquidate VBS mutual bank.  Curatorship  Following liquidity problems, VBS Bank was placed under curatorship on 11 March 2018 in terms of the South African Banks Act, Act 94 of 1990, by the (SARB). The collapse of the bank had a large negative impact on the funeral industry in Limpopo Province as the bank was unable to honour insurance and burial society obligations backed by the bank. It also had a devastating impact on stokvel and saving societies held by poor, predominantly black, South Africans in the Limpopo Province. In October 2018 the national government announced that it would not bail out South African municipalities that had irregularly deposited R1.57 billion with the bank before it collapsed. After the bank's collapse it was found that the bank held R372 million in negative equity.  Corruption  A 2018 report released by the SARB in October found evidence of wide-scale looting, fraud and corruption. It recommended that bank leadership, public officials and auditors be criminally charged and held liable in civil proceedings. The report found that R1,894,923,674 (US$ 130 million) was transferred from the Bank to fifty three individuals between 15 March 2015 and 17 June 2018. According to the report, R16,148,569 (US$1.09 million) of that money went to Brian Shivambu, younger brother of the Economic Freedom Fighter senior politician Floyd Shivambu. https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-10-13-the-chronicles-of-grand- azania-part-two-floyd-shivambus-time-of-spending-dangerously/ https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-09-08-vbs-theft-money-laundering- lifes-little-luxuries-julius-malemas-time-of-spending-dangerously/The report also implicated the African National Congress's deputy chairperson for Limpopo, Florence Radzilani, and treasurer, Danny Msiza. In June 2020 eight people associated with VBS and the bank's auditor, KPMG, were charged by the NPA on 47 counts of theft, fraud, corruption and contraventions of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act.

Kell worked in Leicester as a shoe rivetter, and was an early member of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Rivetters and Finishers. In 1878, he was elected as the union's first president, working on a part-time basis. Kell was also interested in politics, seeing himself as part of the Radical tradition in the Liberal Party. He was elected to the Leicester School Board, working with George Sedgwick to campaign against children being forced to work at home. He was later also elected to Leicester Town Council. By the late 1880s, Kell was unhappy with the rise of socialism in the union. He gave a speech early in 1890, denouncing militancy among its members. Later in the year, the union refused to increase his salary, so he resigned and began running a business.

Description  The painting, completed in 1897, was purchased by Henry Roujon during the exhibition dedicated to the painter. At the instigation of St√©phane Mallarm√©, Roujon intended to create a collection of living artists, of contemporary art, to be permanently exhibited at the Luxembourg Palace in Paris: this is a detail that shows how, at the end of the 19th century, Renoir had by then become one of the most famous French artists. Today the painting is on display at the Mus√©e de l'Orangerie. Like the previous one, Girls at the Piano, Yvonne and Christine Lerolle au piano is also very significant on the formal level since the pictorial material here is no longer treated with the severely linear style of the previous decade, but with a renewed freshness and a recovery of the chromatic harmonies typical of the impressionist phase of the painter. An optimistic theme, much loved by bourgeois collectors, is portrayed: that of girls in a domestic atmosphere, playing games, reading or - as in this case - exercising music. Renoir describes with great precision various details of the domestic environment in which the girls find themselves, focusing mainly on the two paintings hanging on the wall, in this case Before the race\\" and \\"Group of dancers\\", both by Degas. The dominant colour is the white of the girl's dress in the foreground, which, however, does not resolve itself in the soft luminosity that flooded the Jeunes, creating an all in all cold atmosphere. Renoir addresses several iconographic models in this paintings canvas. Transparent is the reference to contemporary paintings by Berthe Morisot, an impressionist painter who loved to paint domestic scenes of this type: in the nineteenth century, in fact, the home assumed new meanings, and became a place to escape from the alienating and depersonalizing frenzy of modern civilization. The scene as a whole is also linked to the genre scenes of 17th century Dutch painters, especially Vermeer, the author of paintings that stand out for their tame, pearly quietness. Renoir achieved great success with his portraits, becoming the favourite painter for the French bourgeoisie. This meant that the Parisian bourgeoisie accepted impressionist painters and rejected the works of academic masters. The Lerolle family was a great protector of the new creators, especially Degas, as we can see in the two paintings that appear decorating the wall. However, Renoir is the one chosen to make the portrait of the two young women playing the piano, a composition similar to the Girls playing the piano painted in 1892. Yvonne dresses in white and strives to play a piece on the piano while her sister Christine contemplates the score in an accomplice way. Although the master does not renounce capturing natural light and colour, he is particularly interested in the modelling and drawing of the figures, wrapped in an atmosphere that does not manage to dilute the contours as Monet did. The expressiveness of the two models is another point of reference in the work, although in recent works Renoir does not load the inks on the personality of his models as in his early works - see L√©onard Renoir or Victor Chocquet. In this way, the French master presents himself as a painter who gives joy and a certain romanticism to his compositions, achieving an important success before the public, as proof that this work was the first acquired by the French State.

Subsequently, later having been adopted by the medical academic research in studying male infertility . The term of male fertility crisis has now been adopted to become a study subject itself. The male infertility crisis has been described as the ongoing rapid decrease in sperm quality and subsequent challenges in male infertility. The earliest indications of this decrease first emerged in the 1970s. From this period there has been a steady decline of 1.4% in sperm counts. The matter is particularly relevant in the west in New Zealand, Australia, Europe & North America. A reduction in other parts of the world has yet to be observed. In its original form, it had begun as a study on male fertility. Evolving into a term used by journalists in the media as a common headline for the reporting for studies concerning sperm, infertility and declining male sexual performance. Hypotheses for the causes of the crisis is still subject to ongoing further research. From existing research cites lifestyle factors and the presence of hormone-disrupting chemicals in the environment. The effects and the issues caused are in the progress of development. As the understanding of the effects on individuals, family and society are ongoing subjects for further studies. This topic has been subject to rigorous debate in regards to the nature and exact degree of crisis that is exhibited in male fertility. However, it has generally been accepted within the scientific community as a key issue of male health. Their aim is to bring the issue to the forefront of media and to public attention. As a consequence, responses to address the crisis have begun to occur with developments in frameworks to support those who are experiencing male infertility and academic research to remedy the issue.  Usage of the term  The first uses of the term being used stem as far back as the early 1970s with suggestions it may have emerged earlier in the 1960s. However, significant traction for the issue as it becomes further highlighted by the 1990s when it became more commonly studied, thus subsequent attention is paid to the issue. The term has become a catch- all term as part of the discussion of the health issues of men. There is now ongoing media coverage on the issue often being used as a common headline driver. Research analysis has found amongst a sample of British newspapers in the 1990s there had been a recognisable discourse in the tone of a crisis. In recent years, there has been substantial growth in the frequency of media coverage often coinciding and in response with releases of studies. Mass media coverage is subject to significant controversy as the use of terms such as \\"crisis\\", \\"apocalypse\\" \\"timebomb\\" and \\"threat to human race\\" have led to arguments that it has given rise to clickbait or hysterical coverage elevating fears within the community. Media headlines of the male infertility crisis. Various tabloid media agencies have published various pieces with headlines that have supported the notion of crisis. Examples include from GQ labelling it ‚Äúthe truth behind the shocking drop in sperm counts,‚Äù followed by a Newsweek front page cover ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Killing America‚Äôs Sperm?‚Äù and with the New York Times stating it as ‚Äúmale infertility crisis is coming‚Äù Discussions of the usage of the terminology of male infertility crisis by the media have been evident through various comparisons. For the emphasis of the crisis, one example drew a time-series comparisons between the present-day generations and past generations i.e. fathers and grandfathers or geographic comparisons within countries or to other regions. Further stark comparisons include drawing similarities to other species notably rats and hamsters. Some have compared the long term effects with the fertility collapse in dystopian fictional works such as Children of Men and The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale'. Academia and the scientific community have agreed in consensus in favour of the use of the term. Citing it as necessary to prompt preventative action to remedy the issue in the present time before it affects future generations on a greater scale. While others such as social commentators have argued the wide-ranging consequences that follow the male infertility crisis necessitate the use of crisis terminology. Consequences include the subsequent inability to conceive a child. Thus, the effect of involuntary childlessness can be viewed as a crisis.  Development and History  Beginning in the 1970s & 1980s, the first studies were published that observed declines in the sperm quality and later sperm quantities of men. One of the earliest studies in a paper published in 1974 by Nelson et al. had observed decreases in the sperm quality with lower concentrations and volumes in particular increase in the percentage of observations with abnormalities in sperm. Often these earlier findings have been criticised in the conduct having been cited for various faults including issues of sampling selection and various other inaccuracies in the obtaining of data. There were various reports published in the 1970s & 1980s that had not found similar declines. An example is a research paper by Niecheslag et al. in 1982 concluded no decline. Instead found no parameter changes in sperm. However, the claims are not completely unfounded it reflected a general shift in societal patterns changes in sexual behaviour, the prevalence drugs, preferences for later marriages and fatherhood that brought the earliest signs to attention In 1980 the World Health Organisation published its first publication, a laboratory manual for semen analysis. This set the parameters for the worldwide measurement standards in sperm quality and normality. Male infertility changes in testicular biopsy. Limited research in the 1980s found the first signs behind the decline with links to general environmental degradation. = The 1990s = This period saw a significant development in the research where results began to show the first signs of conclusive data to prove a true decline.A landmark 1992 Danish study commonly referred to as the Carlsen study after the principal author had reached following an analysis of a range of studies from 1938-1990 from a population described as healthy men had experienced a sharp decline during the aforementioned period. Following this study, substantial funding is given to further studies which are conducted to support this thesis to attempt to find causes that have driven the decline. In the late 1990s, the first studies on the social and psychological impact of the crisis are published. Towards the end of the 1990s, the earliest breakthrough in the development of remedies for the male infertility crisis is found with the use of the technique known as Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). = Recent developments = By the 2010s it had become very clear, there had been significant declines with a steady decrease in sperm quality and quantity. There had now been wide-ranging publications particularly in the beginnings of the causes for the decline. In one meta-analysis study published in 2017 by Hebrew University had concluded decreases in sperm concentrations up to 52.4% and similarly a decrease of 59.3% in total sperm numbers. Two follow on studies in the year 2018 presented at the Scientific Congress of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) had observed similar findings to find sperm counts had reduced and lower mobility of sperm during the 2000s. A 2012 paper published by French researchers and the Institute for Public Health in the Journal of Human Reproduction studied French males between the period of 1989‚Äì2005. They concluded the sperm counts and the proportion of normal sperm fell by 32.2% and 8.1% respectively. Male sperm swimming Further research had supported evidence in the role of lifestyle factors and further impact of socioeconomic status. One of the latest studies published in February 2020 journal JAMA Network Open had investigated 4 varying diets using a sample of 2935 young Danish men. It came to the conclusion men who consumed a ‚Äúwestern diet\\" composed of predominantly of red meat, fried food, and sugar-sweetened drinks and desserts had the worse outcome out of the 4 diets with a sperm count ranging from 109 million to 138 million. The study had found a prudent \\"healthy diet\\" composed of fish, chicken, fruit and vegetables. This diet had the highest sperm count with an average of 146 million to 183 million sperm. The co-author of the study stated the importance of diet citing it as \\"necessary for the production of healthy functioning sperm with high fertility potential‚Äù  Discussions and controversy  The effects of the crisis are still being understood apart from the well-known correlated issue of directly affecting fertility rates and child birthing rates. The debate remains within the andrology community on the conclusive nature of the evidence to support the claims of crisis. Consequential reasoning for the causes of the crisis is still subject to controversy. Perspectives range on the issue with some viewing it from a biological viewpoint with the focus on causes and medical effects. The research-based in a clinical quantitative lab-based setting has been the traditional biological viewpoint. = Sociology perspective = Sociologists studying the topic focus on the effect on society and cultures. This domain seeks to be more based on human experiences with a focus on mental and emotional aspects in particular metrics of emotional wellbeing and stress. Sociology studies are part of research seeking to broaden the perspectives on the matter bringing to focus other aspects of the fertility crisis. Traditionally the topic of fertility has been exclusively on women with men sidelined. = Criticisms = Critics of the study of male infertility crisis have cited research that has in part led to the stigmatization of men. The infertility crisis has become conflated with other health-related matters particularly with mental health with the potential of trauma and worthlessness. Spillover effects into society to male vulnerability and perceived threats to male status. Direct evidence that supports claims of stigmatisation caused by men experiencing the fertility crisis is lacking, however. Various researchers in this area argue not enough research has been conducted and thus, lacks the extensive scientific database relative to other fields of medicine or female fertility. It may be part of the issue to find remedies or lead to remedies that are sub-optimal. There is a debate on the degree of the effect of the crisis with arguments about the impact of the rate of decline. Sperm has declined (99 million sperm per ml) in 1970 to (47 million sperm per mL) 2011. It remains in a relatively normal range above the 15 million WHO considers below normal. The issue of most concern is the reduction in averages of abnormal sperm counts. Health practitioners and fertility doctors who work in the field are sceptical of the notion of crisis in male fertility as they had not observed a dramatic decline from the first- hand experience. There is a disconnect between what has been studied in the published research and what is observed in public.  Other Issues  The existing methods to attempt to remedy the issue of fertility that are most commonly used for example Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is known to have complications, it is often viewed as expensive and lacking effective access.  Responses  There has been much academic research now focusing on attempts to remedy the issue. Proponents argue more needs to be done on causes, in particular, the role of lifestyle factors and a reduction of exposure to environmental chemicals. The thought within the medical community that calls for the breaking down of the stigma that surrounds male fertility requiring a cultural shift to emphasize the importance of the issue as part of the continued decline in health outcomes. Advocates and proponents of the topic of male infertility have argued for modernization and reform of the health care system through improved practices and increased levels of funding. They argue the role of private health insurance and government to be potential leaders in this area. Social programs to alleviate the impact of the crisis have been implemented as part of a framework of men's reproductive health to address the crisis. Various awareness groups in male reproductive health now exist examples include Men's Health Week and international male health awareness program of Movember. Within Australia, the federal government established funding for the Healthy Male a program intended to support male reproductive health and fertility. Further efforts include an award of a grant in this area of approximately $3million to Andrology Australia. Other national government responses include advice provided by the UK National Health Service (NHS) recommending a healthy lifestyle and loose-fitting underwear to improve sperm thus fertility. Organisations in the medical field have been established to address the crisis. Most notably the Male Reproductive Health Initiative is a group focused on male fertility in the attempts to foster and support reform and action to address the issue to enable improvements in outcomes.

Early life Ysabel Su√°rez Galb√°n was born into a wealthy family in Havana, Cuba on December 25, 1885. Her father, Luis Su√°rez Galb√°n grew up between the small towns of Gu√≠a and G√°ldar on the Spanish Atlantic island of Gran Canaria. Galb√°n emigrated to Cuba at the age of 15 and built a fortune in the sugar industry and other businesses. He later partnered with Venezuelan financier Heriberto Lobo and, through the firm Galb√°n Lobo y Compa√±√≠a, the families owned several sugar estates in Cuba as well as the Cuban National Bank. By 1899, Galb√°n had moved to New York City and become a director of the North American Trust Company. One of Ysabel's brothers was deaf and became a pupil at the Wright Oral School for the Deaf in New York City. It likely was there that Ysabel met the school's founder John Dutton Wright. Wright was a pioneer in the education of deaf and \\"deaf-mute\\" children; Helen Keller was one of his school's first pupils, spending two years there. Marriage On November 25, 1912, 26-year- old Ysabel married Wright, who was 46. The wedding took place at Luis Su√°rez Galb√°n's apartments in the Hotel Majestic on Central Park West, a luxury hotel that in this period was home to Gustav Mahler, Edna Ferber and the young Dorothy Parker. Ysabel and John set up home in New York City and had two children: John Suarez (John Jr.) and Anna Dutton Wright, born December 26, 1916. Ysabel's father, Luis Su√°rez Galb√°n, died in 1917. By that time, the Wright family was living in Yonkers where on July 6, 1918, Ysabel and John hosted Helen Keller, who was traveling to Los Angeles for filming of Deliverance, a silent film about her life. Keller played in the garden with the Wright's children, climbing up to a treehouse, and shared reminiscences with a group of former schoolmates from the Wright Oral School. After the United States' entry into the First World War, Ysabel volunteered with the War Camp Community Service, an initiative of the Playground Association of America. Quien Sabe? and botanical work After the war, the Wright family relocated to Santa Barbara, California around 1919. They bought a house on a site at Montecito and renamed the estate \\"Quien Sabe?\\". They commissioned Colonial Revival architect George Washington Smith to design a grand new house, based on a manor house John Wright remembered from a trip to Spain. Ultimately, only Smith's service block design was ever built. To surround the house, Ysabel had landscape architect Peter Riedel design a garden of many terraces, each dedicated to the plants of a particular type or region. There was an olive grove and a citrus orchard, herbaceous gardens with blue and red themes, an Australian garden and a South African garden, all watched over by a staff of eight gardeners. Most notable among the many gardens was the cactus and succulent garden, which grew to include many rare species. Although they had a large house and a new garden to organize, the Wrights also found time for extensive foreign travel from 1920 onwards, often driven by John's work with education of deaf children. They traveled to South America aboard the , to India (with their children) and to Japan where John advocated for Japan‚Äôs first oral school for the deaf. It appears that the new garden and her international travel stimulated Ysabel's interest in botany. Back at Quien Sabe? she continued to develop the garden but started to correspond with botanists specializing in cacti. The Quien Sabe? cactus collection became internationally known and was photographed for the 1936 Country Life Book of Gardens. As well as collecting cacti, Ysabel also took an interest in California's native flora. In July 1929, she took a trip to Mono and Tuolumne counties in the Sierra Nevada and collected more than 160 plant specimens, most of which are now held in the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden herbarium, recorded under her married name, Mrs. J. D. Wright. In the late 1930s, with John Wright growing elderly, the couple spent more of their time in New York, near the Wright Oral School. On July 15, 1940, the Wright's daughter, Anna, married Thomas Drumheller, son of a sheep-farming family from Walla Walla, Washington, in New York City. From 1937 to 1942, Ysabel and John rented Quien Sabe? to Donald Culross Peattie and his wife Louise. At the garden's height, Ysabel Wright had employed eight gardeners to maintain the grounds; by the time the Peatties moved in, only Japanese-born Hideko was left. During this time the Wrights also subdivided the estate, selling off portions on which new houses were built. A few years later, realizing that she was unlikely to return to live at Quien Sabe?, Ysabel donated her rarest cacti to Ganna Walska's Lotusland and the Huntington Botanical Gardens in 1941 and 1942. The cactus species Turbinicarpus ysabelae is named in her honor. In 1925, the herpetologist Edward Harrison Taylor names two reptile species for members of the Wright family: Sphenomorphus wrighti for J.D.

On 17 June, the defence was organised in Chasselay, a village about fifteen kilometres north-west of Lyon. Barricades were erected, thanks to soldiers of the 405th RADCA of Sathonay, the 25th Senegalese infantry regiment, legionnaires (2 of them rest in the tata) and also with the help of civilians. Having met very little resistance from Dijon, the Germans arrived on June 19, near the Montluzin convent in Lissieu. Heavy and violent fighting between German and French troops resulted in 51 deaths, including one civilian on the French side, and more than 40 wounded for the Germans.  Description  The building, entirely red ochre, consists of tombstones surrounded by a rectangular enclosure 2.8 metres high. Its porch and its four corners are surmounted by pyramids covered with piles. The solid oak clerestory gate is decorated with eight African masks.

The Shatt al-Arab was considered an important channel for both states' oil exports, and in 1937, Iran and the newly independent Iraq signed a treaty to settle the dispute. In the 1975 Algiers Agreement, Iraq made territorial concessions‚Äîincluding the Shatt al-Arab waterway‚Äîin exchange for normalized relations. In return for Iraq recognizing that the frontier on the waterway ran along the entire thalweg, Iran ended its support of Iraq's Kurdish guerrillas. Background Since the Ottoman‚ÄìPersian Wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, Iran (known as \\"Persia\\" prior to 1935) and the Ottomans fought over Iraq (then known as Mesopotamia) and full control of the Shatt al-Arab until the signing of the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639 which established the final borders between the two countries. Clashes =Pahlavi Iran-Iraqi Kingdom tensions= The Shatt al-Arab was considered an important channel for both states' oil exports, and in 1937, Iran and the newly independent Iraq signed a treaty to settle the dispute. In the same year, Iran and Iraq both joined the Treaty of Saadabad, and relations between the two states remained good for decades afterwards. =Pahlavi Iran-Ba'athist Iraq tensions= Crisis in relations 1969‚Äì1974 In April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 treaty over the Shatt al-Arab, and as such, ceased paying tolls to Iraq when its ships used the waterway. Iran's abrogation of the treaty marked the beginning of a period of acute Iraqi-Iranian tension that was to last until the 1975 Algiers Agreement. In 1969, Saddam Hussein, Iraq's deputy prime minister, stated: \\"Iraq's dispute with Iran is in connection with Khuzestan, which is part of Iraq's soil and was annexed to Iran during foreign rule.\\" The Shatt al-Arab on the Iran‚ÄìIraq border In 1971, Iraq (now under Saddam's effective rule) broke diplomatic relations with Iran after claiming sovereignty rights over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Persian Gulf following the withdrawal of the British. As retaliation for Iraq's claims to Khuzestan, Iran became the main patron of Iraq's Kurdish rebels in the early 1970s, giving the Iraqi Kurds bases in Iran and arming the Kurdish groups. In addition to Iraq fomenting separatism in Iran's Khuzestan and Balochistan, both states encouraged separatist activities by Kurdish nationalists in the other state. Military clashes 1974‚Äì75 From March 1974 to March 1975, Iran and Iraq fought border skirmishes over Iran's support of Iraqi Kurds. In 1975, the Iraqis launched an offensive into Iran using tanks, though the Iranians defeated them. Several other attacks took place; however, Iran had the world's fifth most powerful military at the time and easily defeated the Iraqis with its air force. Some 1,000 people died on the course of the 1974‚Äì75 clashes in the Shatt al-Arab region. As a result, Iraq decided against continuing the war, choosing instead to make concessions to Tehran to end the Kurdish rebellion. In the 1975 Algiers Agreement, Iraq made territorial concessions‚Äîincluding the Shatt al-Arab waterway‚Äîin exchange for normalised relations. In return for Iraq recognising that the frontier on the waterway ran along the entire thalweg, Iran ended its support of Iraq's Kurdish guerrillas. =After the Iranian Revolution= Despite Iraq's goals of regaining the Shatt al-Arab, the Iraqi government seemed to initially welcome Iran's Revolution, which overthrew Iran's Shah, who was seen as a common enemy. on 17 September 1980, Iraq suddenly abrogated the Algiers Protocol following the Iranian revolution. Saddam Hussein claimed that the Islamic Republic of Iran refused to abide by the stipulations of the Algiers Protocol and, therefore, Iraq considered the Protocol null and void. Five days later, the Iraqi army crossed the border.

BCE, in addition to the form of the toumba in Northern Greece, or the Kouros in ancient times, a large stone or marble tombstone was used, like that of the ancient cemetery of Paros, where for at least two centuries there were hero-cult with offerings and sacrifices to the dead, male warriors. Polyandria of the 5th c. are known in Attica, Central and Northern Greece, but are scarcely associated with extreme historical conditions. An impressive polyandrion is that of ancient Athens, associated with the early years of the Peloponnesian War and the sudden plague that broke out in the city-state. The sequence of the typology of the monuments ended around 317 BCE following the legislation of Demetrios of Phaleron, who banned the rich sculpture demonstration. Athenian citizens were mentioned either with a monument called a trapeza or with a small pillar. These monuments generally refer to the name of the deceased, the name of his father and the municipality in which the citizen was registered. The simple style of the newer monuments was considered to be an extreme expression of the ideology of isonomia, the fundamental equality of all citizens.

Thonemann was born in Melbourne and moved to Oxford University in 1944, becoming one of the earliest researchers on the topic of controlled fusion. He led the fusion research at Oxford in its early years, before moving to the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (Harwell) in 1950. He led the ZETA reactor development at Harwell and announced its apparent success in 1958. Thonemann was deputy director of the new Culham Laboratory in 1965-66. In 1968 he left Culham to become Professor of Physics at today's Swansea University, where he worked on applying his physics knowledge to biological research. He retired from Swansea in 1984, living out his life in the city. Early life and education Julius Emil Thonemann moved to Australia from Germany in 1854 and was consul to Victoria for the Austro- Hungarian Empire from 1866 to 1879. His son, Frederick Emil Thonemann, was born in 1860 in Melbourne. Frederick established a wool trading business, Thonemann and Lange, which later became a stock brokerage, F. Thonemann and Sons, among other businesses. Peter was the second of four children, born to Frederick's second wife, Mabel Jessie Fyfe. Peter grew up in the family's large house, \\"Rathgawn\\", and attended Melbourne Grammar School. In 1936 he began a physics degree at the University of Melbourne, completing his bachelor's degree in 1939. When the war started that year, he was sent to work at the Munitions Supply Laboratories in Melbourne, where he worked until 1942 when he moved to Amalgamated Wireless in Sydney. There, he met his future wife, Jean, with whom he had two children, Helena, in 1946, and Philip, in 1949. In 1944 he began his master's degree at the University of Sydney, where he wrote his thesis on the study of high frequency fields in an ionized gas. Australian universities were not offering PhDs at that time, so he took a position at Oxford University later that year. Fusion work Immediately after the war, Jim Tuck returned to Oxford from his time on the Manhattan Project. He met Thonemann, whose experience in electric discharges in gas made him familiar with the pinch effect, a possible route to controlled fusion. The two wrote a proposal to build a small machine, but before it was approved, Tuck returned to the US. In 1947, Cousins and Ware began experiments using pinch in toroidal tubes. Thonemann was able to arrange a small amount of funding, and in 1948 began basic experiments with electrical discharges in a linear tube containing mercury gas to study the pinch effect. By the next year he had moved to a larger copper torus and was able to demonstrate the pinch to Frederick Lindemann and John Cockcroft. Thonemann became the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) Head of Research on Controlled Thermonuclear Reactions in 1949, a position he held until 1960. As a result of the exposing of Klaus Fuchs as a Soviet spy, by 1952 the fusion research at Oxford was moved to Harwell, while Cousins and Ware's work moved to the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. At Harwell, Cockcroft had successfully argued for the construction of a much larger machine, ZETA. By 1957, early indications were that ZETA had successfully produced tiny amounts of fusion, and the story began to leak to the press. This led to considerable coverage about Thonemann's role in the Australian press. In January it was announced that ZETA had succeeded. After further work, it became clear that the signals of fusion were false, and the story had to be withdrawn, causing great embarrassment. After some arguments within the UK scientific establishment, the decision was made to move the fusion-related work to a new location at Culham. Thonemann moved to Culham and became the deputy director during 1965-66. Biological studies In 1968, Thonemann moved to University College of Swansea, now Swansea University, to become a Professor of Physics. He was not able to raise funds to begin a fusion program at Swansea, and instead began applying the mathematics of the dynamics of particles in plasma to the movement of E. coli in response to the gradients of nutrients. Thonemann retired from Swansea in 1984 but continued to live in the town until his death on 10 February 2018, aged 100. He had two children, a son and daughter, with his wife Jean.

It was built from 1851 to 1853 by James Connor, a mason. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Public education began exceptionally early in the Blue Mountains, with the National School at Bowenfels erected in 1851. The foundation stone had been laid in October 1850. It was built by local people to a local design. It contained three rooms originally, one the school room, the other two the living space for the school teachre, John Edhouse. It opened without furniture, water supply or toilet but the local \\"patrons\\", mainly Scottish farmers, paid for improvements in 1852 and 1853. In 1866 a new school room was built and all three rooms of the 1851 building became the schoolmaster's residence. The stone mason was James Connor, an innkeeper who lived nearby in Umera, itself later a private school. Connor was a gifted craftsman and responsible for some of the finest grave markers in the local cemeteries. The 1866 building remained in use as a primary school for an extraordinarily long time, over a century, until the end of 1969. Since then the complex has been privately owned. For a time the 1866 school was used as an artist's studio, while the artist lived in the 1855 (sic: 1851-3) building.Jack, 2014  Description  1851-3 school house: 1851.

The residence is also the first government school established west of the Blue Mountains. The former Bowenfels National School group of two sandstone buildings is the only known group of school buildings erected under the Board of Education which controlled education in NSW from 1848 to 1866. The two buildings demonstrate the evolution of educational country school history spanning the period from 1851 to 1969. The group of two buildings is the earliest of any type of school remaining in the Bowenfels and Hartley areas and form important components of the historic Old Bowenfels Historic Village. Both buildings remain little altered since built, the residence being an excellent example of local vernacular building and the class room building is a rare remaining work of the noted colonial architect Henry Robertson. The buildings have strong associations with the local community from 1851 and are associated with many noted local historical figures, in particular Andrew Brown of Cooerwall. The site is significant in not having changed appreciable[ly] since 1851 and forms an important landscaped component of the village of Old Bownfels.

The novel was published in 2018 by HarperCollins in Canada and by Knopf Publishers internationally. A bildungsroman, the story follows the early life of George Washington \\"Wash\\" Black, chronicling his escape from slavery and his subsequent adventures. The novel won the 2018 Scotiabank Giller Prize,\\"Esi Edugyan wins Scotiabank Giller Prize for 'Washington Black'\\". CTV News, November 19, 2018. and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize. Summary George Washington \\"Wash\\" Black is born into slavery on Barbados. He is raised by Big Kit, another slave. When Wash was eleven, the owner of the plantation dies and the plantation is turned over to his nephew, the extraordinarily cruel Erasmus Wilde. Wash's life continues on much as it did before, until he and Big Kit are called to serve in the big house. There he meets Wilde's younger brother, Christopher \\"Titch\\" Wilde, a scientist, who enlists Wash as his manservant. Titch teaches Wash to read and cook and, after noticing he is a prodigious artist, allows him to focus on drawing. Titch and Erasmus are later joined by their cousin Philip. Philip eventually reveals to Erasmus and Titch that their father has died, leading Erasmus to hatch a plan to move back to return home for a few years, leaving Titch in charge. He furthermore refuses to sell Wash to Titch, having become aware both of how close they are and of Wash's artistic talents. While arrangements are still being made, Philip commits suicide in front of Wash. When Wash informs Titch of the death of his cousin, he realizes that Erasmus will murder Wash in retaliation for Philip's death. To save Wash the two escape. Due to a sudden storm, Titch directs them to crash into a merchantman and jump ship. There they meet the captain Bendikt Kinast and his brother, the ships doctor Theo Kinast. Though the brothers guess that Wash is a runaway slave, they nevertheless decide to take the pair to Virginia. In Virginia, Titch learns that his brother has hired a bounty hunter to capture Wash, a Mr. Willard. While there they also meet up with a penpal of Titch's named Edward Farrow, who is an abolitionist. While at Farrow's Titch also learns that his father may still be alive, prompting him to decide to go to the Arctic to see him. Farrow and Titch offer Wash the opportunity to escape to Upper Canada where former slaves are able to live in freedom, but Wash declines. In the Arctic, Titch learns that his father is in fact alive, but Wash is surprised that their reunion is so cold, and Titch's father is indifferent to his sons and their disputes. Devastated by his father, Titch decides to leave the Arctic and Wash behind. Though Wash tries to follow him he is unsuccessful, and Titch disappears during a snowstorm. Mr. Wilde tries to find him, but after searching for several days he comes back empty-handed and dies of a fever. No longer under the protection of either Wilde, Wash decides to take Titch's advice and resettles in Shelburne, Nova Scotia. From the ages of thirteen to sixteen, Wash lives a life of fear, afraid that the bounty on his head will be collected. After spying some jellyfish on the docks, he remembers his interest in illustration and turns to that passion anew. He meets Tanna, a fellow aspiring illustrator and the daughter of renowned marine biologist G.M. Goff. Wash works with Goff and Tanna to collect and illustrate marine specimens, and has the novel idea of creating an aquarium. Tanna and Wash eventually fall in love and have sex after Wash is attacked by Mr. Willard. Wash had fought off Willard's attack, knifing him through the eye, but had been injured himself. Getting word that Titch may be alive, Wash follows Tanna and Goff to London, where the three begin work on their aquarium. Wash and Tanna look for information into Wash's past life and discover that Big Kit is Wash's mother. Wash attends Willard's public hanging for murder at Newgate Prison. Wash and Tanna eventually track down Titch in Marrakesh, Morocco. In the deserts outside of Marrakesh, Wash finds Titch living alone with a young Moroccan boy. Wash confronts Titch about their time together and his abandonment of Wash. A desert storm comes down upon the camp and, having received no satisfactory answer from Titch, the book ends with Wash beginning to walk off into the swirling sand.

It was built from 1815 to 1832 by convict labour. It is also known as Military Station Archaeological Site and Burial at Glenroy, Cox's River Military Station and Government Provision Depot. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 October 2010.  History  =Colonial history= The military station archaeological site located at Glenroy is located on the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri people. Wiradjuri country is generally defined as the land bordered by the Lachlan, Macquarie and Murrumbidgee rivers in Central New South Wales. The name Wiradjuri means, \\"people of the three rivers\\" and traditionally these rivers were the primary source of food for the Wiradjuri people. Lying at the foot of the Sandstone escarpment and on the banks of the River Lett, the Hartley area may be considered a topographic interface between the mountains and the plains that also forms a cultural border between neighbouring Aboriginal groups and languages: the Wiradjuri People and the Gundungurra People. Archaeological evidence suggests that Aboriginal people followed long established routes through the landscape, and generally left the cold highlands for the milder plains during the winter months. Paths between the Coxs River Valley, Megalong Valley and Burragorang are documented in the descriptions of daily life in the Megalong Valley contained in Cullenbenbong and Green Mountains by Bernard O'Reilly. Prior to the arrival of settlers, the Lett Valley provided Aboriginal people with a wide spectrum of bush foods, medicinal plants and campsites on the elevated slopes along the valley sides and ridges. Traps and poisons such as hickory bark were employed to catch or stun the fish and eels in the river. By controlled firing, the understorey of the vegetation was kept open and accessible, as well as encouraging regrowth of new plants, which in turn attracted game. This gave the bushland an open park like quality so much admired by the colonists.Otto Cserhalmi, 2002: 28-30 Lachlan Macquarie and his family arrived in Sydney in January 1810 to accept his commission as Governor of New South Wales. Macquarie's first year as governor was considered a success and set the tone and character for the twelve years of Macquarie's administration. He re-organised government departments and created a strong focus on the construction of quality public works using convict labour that transformed Sydney, Parramatta and the new townships, a number of which still exist in the twenty first century. By 1822 Macquarie had listed 265 works of varying scale which had been carried out during his tenure as governor. Other important outcomes of his administration included the opening of a new market- place in Sydney in October 1810 and the first public fair held \\"by regular authority\\" at Parramatta in March 1813 . In July 1813 the colony obtained coinage in place of the noted of hand and barter system previously used and at the end of 1816 Macquarie encouraged the creation of the colony's first bank. Macquarie's administration also had particular concern for public morality and his policies concerning the Aboriginal people reflected a humanitarian conscience. Significantly, Macquarie understood that one of the most important issues of the colony was the need to increase agricultural production and livestock. Despite his efforts to encourage farmers to improve their properties alternate spectres of glut and famine continued to threaten the economy during most of his administration.MacLachlan, N. D. \\"Macquarie, Lachlan\\" Exploration of the settlement was another important focus of Macquarie's administration. He encouraged so much exploration that by the time he left the colony the explored area was many times what it had been when he arrived. Macquarie embarked on his first tour of the outlying districts on 6 November 1810. This was the first of a series of tours including two visits to Van Diemen's Land in 1811 and 1821, three to Newcastle, one to Port Macquarie, which he founded in 1821, and one to the Illawarra in 1822. The news of Blaxland, William Wentworth and Lawson's crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813 and the prospect this presented for access to new lands was cause for excitement for Macquarie who saw it as a sign of the colony's glorious destiny. However, he knew that for the present, New South Wales was a small convict colony and that this destiny was firmly in the future. The Cumberland Plain was sufficient land for the small colony and enough to govern without extending it further west. In late 1813 Macquarie sent Surveyor George Evans to follow the explorers trail and officially verify, and hopefully improve on their findings. Evans travelled further than Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth in that he crossed the Great Dividing Range into the interior, founding the O'Connell, Mitchell, Macquarie and Bathurst Plains. Macquarie was extremely pleased at the news of the plains and proposed to build a road to the new country. While some of Macquarie's eagerness can be attributed to his desire to visit the new country, it was also considered necessary to officially claim the region west of the mountains. The construction of Cox's Road would serve this purpose both symbolically and practically in that it laid suitable foundations for later development, and provided a means to take the colony's starving stock to the new country. Macquarie commissioned William Cox to build the new road even before permission had been received from London.Karskens, 1988: 7-10 William Cox's road across the Blue Mountains reached the junction of the Lett and Cox's River in December 1814 and crossed the rivers by two bridges. The bridge over the River Lett was built in a day and was a low level bridge 6.7 metres long and 3.9 metres wide. The Cox's River bridge was a larger bridge finished in seven days with side beams made of large felled trees. It was 13.7 metres ling with causeways leading to it from the highlands on each side. The latter were filled with stones and covered with earth.Karskens, 1988: 37 Soon after completion of the road Governor and Mrs Macquarie, and a party of servants and dignitaries including: John Thomas Campbell Esquire, Secretary; Captain. H. C. Antill, Major of Brigade; Lieutenant. John Watts, Aid de Camp; William. Redfern Esquire, Assistant. Surgeon; William. Cox Esquire, J. P.; Sir John. Jamison, Knight; John. Oxley Esquire, Surveyor General; James. Meehan, Deputy Surveyor General; George. W. Evans, Deputy Surveyor; J. W. Lewin, Painter & Naturalist journeyed over the Blue Mountains on the new road to visit the newly accessible areas and proclaim the town of Bathurst on 7 May 1815, the first inland town of the colony. The party departed Sydney in April 1815. On 29 April they reached the westward edge of the Blue Mountains, admiring the mountain pass he called Cox's Pass and the beautiful vale beyond which he named Vale of Clwydd. At the distant end of the vale was Cox's River, also named by Macquarie during this journey. The party proceeded and reached the river at 3pm, stopping to set up camp on the left bank of the westward branch of the river for the next two nights. The site had good grass and water for the cattle travelling with the party. The following day, Sunday 30 April, the entire travelling party was gathered after breakfast for divine service, the first Anglican service west of the Blue Mountains. The remainder of the day was spent resting or leisurely exploring. The party continued its journey to Bathurst on Monday 1 May. The party camped at the site on the return journey, arriving on 13 May. The next day, a Sunday, the party gathered for prayers before spending the day exploring the locality once again.Havard and Dowd, 1937 William Hassall crossed the mountains during the winter of 1815 to inspect the cattle herd that had been fixed to a station at the beginning of the Vale of Clywdd. He found that a number had died. Therefore, he moved the herd to a station more exposed to the morning sun, \\"a very pleasant hill opposite the bridge\\" where the Governor had camped. Hassall believed the station to be an excellent stand for oxen, although too hilly for the cows and calves. They could feed on the Vale of Clwydd, including the side towards Mount Blaxland. Hassall and the men accompanying him marked out a place for a yard and huts. By 27 March 1816 Hassall was able to inform the Governor that the men had built an excellent stockyard 15 rod x 13 rod square (75.43 x 65.37 metres square) with a good marking pen and three huts in line with the rear of the stockyard. One was next to the yard 12 feet x 11 (3.65x3.35 metres) for the stockmen, the middle hut of a similar size for the store and the next 20 feet x 10 (6.09x3.04 metres) divided into two rooms, one for the soldiers and one for the overseer when he goes to inspect the stock. They were built of split logs and stringy bark shingles. The doors and shutters were made of broad split wood due to being unable to get sawyers to the site to saw boards. In 1816 the site then known as the Government Provision Depot, was plundered by a group of Aborigines from the other side of the Blue Mountains and the stockmen driven away. Official records do not indicate that any conflict between Aboriginal people and European expeditions and travellers took place prior to European arrival to survey Cox's Road. As a result of the 1816 incident, Macquarie sent a detachment of men from the 46th Regiment under the command of Sargeant Jeremiah Murphy to go to the depot and remain there to protect the Government stockmen, cattle and provision depot and to keep communication open between the coast and Bathurst. The regiment was instructed to ensure that Aborigines did not come within sixty yards. Permission was given to fire upon the Aborigines to compel them to leave. If they still refused they were to be taken as prisoners and sent to Parramatta. The lives of all the women and children were to be saved where possible when an attack on \\"hostile natives\\" Aborigines was required. The instructions to Murphy noted that rather than being local, the Aborigines who had attacked the depot were from the eastern (Sydney) side of the Blue Mountains. It is not revealed which district they came from. No subsequent altercations were recorded at the Depot.Comber, 2009:28; Col Sec, 1816 These instructions are considered to represent the establishment of military protection at Glenroy. The 1816 raid coincided with a spate of Aboriginal raids along the Nepean River in the first four months of 1816 and were part of a series of ongoing raids in the Nepean area since 1814.Connor, 2002: 47-49 The incident at the depot is believed to be one of only four (recorded) \\"violent\\" confrontations west of the Blue Mountains between the opening of Cox's Pass in 1815 and 1822, and possibly the first. Other incidents included the possible killing of an escaped convict (location not recorded), the spearing of one of William Lawson's horses and the killing of Private James King of the 48th Regiment in unknown circumstances. The relative peace ended following the arrival of Governor Brisbane in 1821 in Sydney who, among other things, ended Macquarie's limit on inland settlement and granted settlers large tracts of land around Bathurst, assigning convicts to the settlers to work these lands. The number of sheep and cattle rose from 33 733 to 113 973 between 1821 and 1825 and alienated land increased from 2520 acres (1010 hectares) to 91636 (36650) hectares in the same period, placing Wiradjuri land use under threat. Attempts to find compromises failed due to the scale of the encroachment of settlement and raids by Aborigines escalated from 1822 until 1824. Governor Brisbane declared martial law in the district in August 1824. This lasted several months before a peace was restored and martial law revoked in December 1824. While it is believed that 22 settlers were killed on the Bathurst frontier during this period, the number of Aboriginal deaths remains disputedConnor, 2002: 56 In the meantime, the government depot site with its military protection, good grass and water had become appealing as a stopping point for travellers journeying over the Blue Mountains, marking the end of a day's stage in the journey. On 11 April 1817 explorer John Oxley's expedition to the interior pitched tent and camped on the bank of the river for the night and again on the return journey in September. Included in this party was botanist Allan Cunningham. Cunningham would camp at the site again in 1822 and note the changes in the local flora over the intervening years. His observations of the growth of two Grevillia in the vicinity of the camp over the two trips would see him become the first to describe the previously unpublished plants. He described the surrounding land as thinly wooded, the soil generally rich, abundant in good grasses and herbage for grazing herds, and possessing all the ordinary requisites for the establishment of the farmer. He would visit again in the future. On 7 October 1820 Corporal James Morland gave evidence to Commissioner John Thomas Bigge as part of an inquiry into the state of the Colony of NSW that all men returning from Bathurst were victualled at the depot as were men bringing beef from Bathurst and flour from the Nepean, including the carters. Morland claimed that the huts were badly put up and in constant need of repair. Macquarie visited again in 1821 when making his second tour of Bathurst with Judge Advocate Wylde. He stayed at the same camping place as he had on his first trip. In 1882 one traveller described pitching their group's tent in front of the houses which were inhabited by a corporal and his wife who provided the travellers with a bucket of milk. In 1824 two French expeditioners Dumont D'Urville and Rene-Primevre Lesson found the site delightful and the surroundings picturesque. At this time the military post held six soldiers and a corporal. In the mid 1820s the military establishment increased and instructions given for building a log hut 30 feet long x 15 feet wide (9.14x4.57 metres) with a partition to accommodate a subaltern officer in 1826. In 1827 the station occupied by a non-commissioned officer and 10-12 men of the 57th regiment. Some travellers found watching the soldiers relaxing on benches outside their neat whitewashed cottage while watching the travellors struggle through the nearby ford disagreeable. One noted that it would only take a short time for some of these men to repair the bridges over the two fords which lay either side of the station but had fallen, requiring horses and their cargo to walk through the rivers. Some repairs were made at the station and the fords during 1827 and 1828. Lieutenant Henry Shadworth of the 57th regiment was quartered at Cox's River as assistant surveyor of roads. On 11 January 1829 Jane, the wife of Lieutenant Kirkley of the 39th regiment died at the station. In May 1829 Major McPherson, military commandant at Bathurst, was instructed to withdraw the increase of the original cows provided at the station for the military. Road gangs were located in the vicinity of the station in 1830 but were not quartered there. In 1831 orders were given for the repair of the officers house as it was infested by bugs and vermin. A single remaining headstone of Eliza Rodd dates from this period. She was the child of J Rodd, Colour Sargeant of the 39th regiment. With the rerouting of the western road in 1831-32 the military station was abandoned and the land sold in 1837 to James Blackett of Sydney. A plan drawn at this time clearly shows four buildings and the outline of a paddock. It is only in 1837 that the name Glenroy appears to have first been used, probably by James Blair, the Scottish magistrate appointed to the area until 1840 when he was transferred to Port Phillip. In the later 1800s William McDermott owned and farmed Glenroy, leasing it in the 1890s to J H Luxton who lived in the former officers' quarters and grew potatoes. All the buildings subsequently vanished. By 1914 the stockade had deteriorated to a place of ruin and desolation. The garden and orchard were overgrown, the fences rotted away and the buildings heaps of rotting timber hidden by weeds and undergrowth. A lone chimney was described as the only remaining, readily identifiable feature in 1914.Bertie, 1914:21-22 However, recollections of recent occupants of the site and some early twentieth century descriptions of the site suggest that a hut may have been reconstructed on one of the early building platforms and used during the mid twentieth century. During 1936 a granite monument was erected nearby in commemoration of the Anglican service held there in 1815. The site has continued to remain in private hands, and in 2010 has been owned by the same family for over fifty years with visitor camping and accommodation facilities. =Eliza Rodd Grave= Grave of Eliza Rodd Eliza Rodd was the daughter of career soldier James Rodd. He fought with the 39th regiment in Canada during the Anglo-American war. The 39th was transferred to France, arriving shortly before the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815. While in France, he married Judith Joseph Baudelet and they had two children. The Regiment was stationed in Ireland from 1819 and then transferred to New South Wales in 1826. James and Judith Rodd brought their son to New South Wales, but left their four- year-old daughter Marie-Anne with her grandparents in Chamblain, France, as she was though too young to make the journey.M.Osterberg-Olsen, 2010 James Rodd was initially stationed at Parramatta before being promoted to colour sergeant in 1827 and sent to Bathurst. By 1829 he was in charge of members of the 39th regiment stationed at Glenroy. Eliza Rodd was born on 10 January 1831 and baptised by the Anglican minister at Bathurst. She was the second child born to James and Judith in New South Wales. She died on 14 September 1831. James Rodd was transferred back to Sydney with his family at the beginning of 1832, leaving a lone grave on a hillside overlooking an idyllic view and marked lovingly with a professionally crafted head and footstones. Judith died at Sydney on 19 April 1832. The 39th Regiment was then transferred to India, taking its colour sergeant and his young sons far from the lone grave at Glenroy. Colour Sergeant James Rodd died in India in December 1832, leaving 13-year-old Ambroise and 6-year-old James, Jr. orphaned. Restoration work and protection of the infant Eliza Rodd's grave has been an ongoing project of Lithgow Regional Branch since 2007. Repairs and restoration were completed in mid-2009. A photograph taken of the site in the early 1900s shows a wood fence.  Description  The archaeological site is located on the property known as Glenroy on the road to the Jenolan Caves. The property is open and grassy, broken by stands of trees located intermittently on the small hills within the generally sloping nature of the country. Watercourses associated with the Cox's River are located at the bottom of the property where the ground flattens out and small granite boulders become common along the river banks. Early river crossings are evident, including remnants of timber posts and a cutting. Several single storey houses and cottages are scattered around the property, primarily of modern construction in a variety of materials. A house at the entry to the property is likely to be of nineteenth or early twentieth century construction with later additions or alterations. Eliza Rodd's grave is located towards the centre of the property and consists of a sandstone head and footstone enclosed with pieces of a modern steel fence approximately 130 cm high. Remains of building platforms are evident in front of the s single storey brick house. These are identifiable by flat grassy areas which contradict the natural sloping landform immediately surrounding the site and are located within the approximate location of the buildings shown on an 1837 plan of the site. Part of the driveway traversing along the front of the site has evidence of a variety of small china, earthenware and glass shards, some likely to date from the early to mid nineteenth century. Occupants of the property have noted that these small pieces continue to rise to the surface over time. = Condition = As at 13 September 2010, much of the archaeological resource is well covered and hidden from view. The site of the four early wooden buildings shown with precision on the 1835 plan is on the terraced hill above Cox's River near the indistinct site of Cox's bridge. Cox's line of road is clear further east, across the River Lett and again on the south side of Cox's River but is not visible at Glenroy, between the original bridges. The opening of the area to picnicking with no controls over the archaeological site poses potential threats. The new house is located close to the rear of the building platforms. = Modifications and dates = *1816 - First three huts and yard completed *1820s - new log hut added *1827-28 - repairs - details unknown *1831 - repairs to officers house *1914 - Site all but disappeared *late twentieth century - evidence of buildings on site suggest the platforms have been utilised for additional buildings that have also since disappeared. *1970s - substantial brick house built in close proximity to the military station building site. *2009 - Restoration and repair of Eliza Rodd Grave and erection of temporary metal fence to protect grave  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 19 May 2010, the military station and burial site and surrounds have high state significance as some of the earliest representation of European incursions into, and claims over the land west of the Blue Mountains for the extension of pastoralism. This activity would eventually displace the local Aboriginal population. The 1816 raid on the provision depot by Aborigines from the other side of the Blue Mountains resulted in perhaps the first \\"violent confrontation\\" between Europeans and Aborigines west of the Blue Mountains following the opening of Cox's Pass. The site also represents early government policy to prevent settlement in the locality out of government control. The area has particular significance for the Anglican religion and the Christian community as the location of the first divine service (Anglican) west of the Mountains and for Europeans as the first government provision depot and late military establishment west of the Blue Mountains. Military Station archaeological site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 October 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Glenroy archaeological site has state historic significance as the first military station west of the Blue Mountains and the location of the first Divine (Anglican) Service west of the Blue Mountains. The general area was the main stopping ground for all travellers who had just descended or were about to ascend Cox's Pass, the first being Governor Macquarie and his party in 1815 following construction of Cox's Road. The station has state significance as the site of one of the earliest recorded conflicts between Europeans and Aborigines west of the Blue Mountains and as the site of one of only four incidents during the relatively peaceful period in the region between 1815 and 1822 prior to government policy changes and the rise of tensions associated with European settlement. It is the first definable incident. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site at Glenroy has significance at a state level for its historical association with the location which Governor Macquarie and his party, (including Mrs Macquarie), stopped to rest on his first tour west of the Blue Mountains following the opening of Cox's Road, as well as during subsequent tours to areas of the colony west of the Blue Mountains. The site has particular associations with the 46th and 39th regiments who were stationed at the post. It also has associations with the many explorers and their parties who not only camped at the site, but were inspired by its beauty and previously unseen flora such as Alan Cunningham and the French explorers Dumont D'Urville and Rene-Primevre Lesson. It has local significance for its association with surveyors James Meehan and John Oxley, two of the colony's most well known surveyors. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The site and surrounds have state significance for their ability to inspire and impress explorers and travellers to the extent that they felt compelled to discuss its beauty in detail in their writings. It has landmark qualities as the termination point of the fertile and level plains of the Vale of Clwydd so admired by travellers when viewed after descending Cox's Pass. Views between the river and the military station site also contribute to an understanding of the placement of the military station initially for the benefit of stock rearing and preventing uncontrolled expansion of settlement. This was quickly extended to surveillance of the local Aboriginal presence and ensuring communication between Bathurst and the coast remained open. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site and surrounds have state social significance for the Anglican and Christian community as a representation of the spread of the religion west of the Blue Mountains and the importance given to religious observance in the early nineteenth century even when far from civilising influences and places dedicated to worship. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has potential to demonstrate the layout of early military/government provision stations west of the Blue Mountains, in particular the first. It has the potential to yield archaeological evidence of the early occupation of the government station and its inhabitants and presents the opportunity to compare differences in layout between more isolated depots and their counterparts closer to established settlements. The opportunity also potentially exists to compare the physical differences between a military station/government depot and a convict stockade. Pottery, glass and china shards may provide evidence of the goods available to the individuals stationed there. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The location is rare at a state level as the site of the first Divine Service (Anglican) west of the Blue Mountains, although the exact spot is unknown. It also has high rarity value as the location of one of the earliest Aboriginal/European conflicts west of the Blue Mountains following the opening of Cox's Road, and one of few to take place prior to 1821. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The site has state significance as one of the earliest areas of European inhabitation west of the Blue Mountains.

According to the tarombo (ancestor genealogy) from Deli and Serdang, Gocah Pahlawan was of keling (Indian) ethnicity, sent by Sultan Iskandar Muda in 1612 to rule in the former Aru Kingdom. He was appointed as a representative commander (wali negara, guardian of the state) of the Aceh Sultanate for the area, to fight the Portuguese influence and establish alliances with the local population, who generally were Karo peoples. Deli sources mentioned that Gocah Pahlawan came from India and that his original name was Muhammad Delikhan, while Serdang sources mentioned that his original name was Yazid and he was a descendant of the rulers of Bukit Siguntang Mahameru, who left the Pagaruyung Kingdom on an Indian merchant ship. Both sources agreed that before Gocah Pahlawan went to Deli, he was first stranded in Pasai, Aceh. He then made services to the Aceh Sultanate by leading its forces in the wars in Bengkulu, Johor, and Pahang. He successfully captured the two daughters of the king of Pahang, namely Princess Kamariah and Princess Khairul Bariah. Gocah Pahlawan married the younger sister of the Sunggal chieftain (Karo: raja urung), Datuk Itam Surbakti, who was the strongest chieftain in that area (Deli Tua), and made alliances with the other three chieftains. The name of the Sunggal chieftain's sister was Princess Nang Bulan (Baluan) beru Surbakti, and the marriage was conducted around 1632. The Karo chieftains who had converted to Islam and adopted the Malay culture then regarded him as their supreme leader (primus inter pares) for the region. The early kingdom lead by Gocah Pahlawan was then called the Bintan Kingdom. Its initial territory was from the border of the Tamiang river to the Rokan Pasir Ayam Denak river. With the help of the Karo chieftains, he expanded his power to Percut and other areas in Deli. Gocah Pahlawan died around 1641, his tomb is located in Batu Jerguk, Deli Tua. His rule was continued by his son, Tuanku Panglima Perunggit.

UWOs were introduced by sections 1‚Äì2 of the Criminal Finances Act 2017 and are governed by sections 362A‚Äì362T of Part 8 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Persons who fail to account are liable to have assets seized after an enforcement authority, such as the National Crime Agency (NCA), makes a successful appeal to the High Court. The power of UWOs in fighting money laundering lies in their reverse onus principle, however the orders are ineffective as soon as a defendant can provide an explanation for the source of their wealth. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the defendant then wins the argument. Information obtained in the context of an UWO cannot be used in a criminal proceeding. The statutory and regulatory scheme for UWOs is set out in paragraphs 11‚Äì18 of Hajiyeva v National Crime Agency [2020] EWCA Civ 108 (05 February 2020).  Cases  The first two Unexplained Wealth Orders were issued in 2018 to Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of Jahangir Hajiyev, the former chairman of the International Bank of Azerbaijan. In February 2020, Ms Hajiyeva lost her appeal against the NCA's bid to seize her London property. She was thus required to \\"provide the NCA with a full account of the sources of her wealth ‚Äì including how she was able to buy her ¬£15m home and the Mill Ride Golf Course in Berkshire\\". In May 2019, the NCA secured three further UWOs as part of an investigation into \\"London property linked to a politically exposed person believed to be involved in serious crime\\". The three properties, originally bought for more than ¬£80m and held by offshore companies, were subsequently identified in an investigation by BBC News, Finance Uncovered and Transparency International into the ownership of London property by members of Kazakhstan's political elite. Nurali Aliyev (Nursultan Nazarbayev's grandson) and his mother Dariga Nazarbayeva \\"have denied all wrongdoing ‚Äì saying they can prove independent and legitimate wealth for their UK property investments\\". On 8 April 2020, the High Court of Justice subsequently ruled that the case against the two be dismissed and that the properties be unfrozen \\"after they spoke more candidly about the sources and scope of their wealth\\". The first successful UWO was in October 2020 against Leeds businessman Mansoor Mahmood Hussain. Hussain, who had links to a convicted murderer, agreed to surrender 45 properties in his property empire to the NCA as well as other assets amounting to a total of almost ¬£10 million. As of July 2020, the NCA is the only body to have secured UWOs. The Serious Fraud Office, HM Revenue & Customs, Financial Conduct Authority and Crown Prosecution Service have authority but have so far not used the legislation. At the same time it was reported that UWO investigations into ‚Äúpolitically exposed persons‚Äù had proved much more difficult than the UK authorities had expected. British media sometimes refer to UWOs as \\"McMafia laws\\" after the McMafia crime drama series on British television and Misha Glenny's original book McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld on organised crime.

It was designed and built in various stages from 1890 to 2003. It is also known as Portland Cement Group and Commonwealth Portland Cement Company Ltd. The property is owned by Boral Limited. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 August 2012.  History  =Portland Cement Works Site - first phase (George Raffan) timeline= *10,000 BC onwardsKnown Aboriginal occupation of this region. *1820British explorer James Blackman was the first recorded white visitor to the region.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 8. *1824First land grants made. *1828MacPherson family took up a grant of and then another in 1832. The name Limestone Flat was associated with their property and they apparently used limestone found on their property in the building of their home (since demolished?). *1836/7William Lawson acquired the MacPherson family lands. *1863Thomas Murray was granted (bought from Lawson?), Portion 52 in the parish of Cullen Bullen, County of Roxburgh. He built two lime kilns on the property sometime after 1869.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 9. *1863Thomas Murray used site for lime production (and presumably extraction).Fenwick & Holmes, 1993. *1882Thomas Murray sold Portion 52 to Charles Bate. *1882Alexander Currie and George Raffan became the owners of Portion 52 in August. *1883Railway line extended to nearby Capertee. *1884A one-roomed school was constructed at some distance from the site, known as the Cullen School. *1887Currie and Raffan with others formed the Cullen Bullen Lime & Marble Works, which bought Portion 52 in this year.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 7, 9. *1889-1895The Cullen Bullen Lime & Marble Works had become the Cullen Bullen Lime & Cement Company by this date. The company produced cement under the brand name of \\"Kangaroo\\". The cement was of variable quality and only produced intermittently on site until production ceased in 1895.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 7. The only remnants of cement production from this era are the two bottle kilns in the north-west corner of Portion 52 and the old brick building known as \\"Raffan's Mill\\". *1894Village of Portland gazetted, to the south of the cement company's lease, with 200 people recorded as living in the area. *1895Cullen School was moved into the new village of Portland and expanded. *1895The Cullen Bullen Lime & Cement Company failed and was taken over by one of the original partners, George Raffan and his brother John, who opened the Ivanhoe Lime and Cement Works & Colliery. *1898The Ivanhoe Lime and Cement Works & Colliery also failed. *1899The name of the school was changed to Portland School. *1899The (British-owned) New Zealand Mines Trust through their agent Dr August Scheidel bought the land, plant and leases from the Raffan brothers. Scheidel, a metallurgist PhD with gold mining experience, obtained backing for an investment of A¬£100,000 to build a cement production plant, of which he remained Managing Director until 1918. =Portland Cement Works Site - second phase (Commonwealth Cement Works Site) timeline= *1900A new company was formed in December, the Commonwealth Portland Cement Company (CPCC) under the guidance of Scheidel, soon installed as Managing Director. Most of the plant was demolished and new works begun, including the installation of a new German Cripps plant.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 10. *1901284 men were recorded as working in a brick plant on the property as well as in construction. A railway line was begun to link the plant to its colliery and to the Portland siding. *1901The first application for a hotel licence in Portland. *1901The CPCC donated a block of land in the south west corner of Portion 52, on the main street of the new town, to the Anglican Church. *1902-1991The site was used as a highly successful, high quality lime quarrying and cement production works, reaching its maximum levels of production in 1928. In the first half of the century it specialised in the \\"Dry Process\\" but in the 1940s it switched over to the \\"Wet Process\\", again requiring decommissioning of much equipment and substantial renewal of the plant. *1902Production of cement was commenced on site under the name of \\"Union\\" brand. The logo of two clasped hands inside a circle was designed by Scheidel in 1901.NBRS&P;, 2003, 25 Demand was soon found to exceed supply. There was an initial phase of expansion for the CPCC that was only curtailed by the commencement of World War I in 1914. Production capacity increased from in 1903 to in 1910.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 11 *1902The CPCC offered the Postal Department the use of one of their newly constructed cottages in Williwa Street to house an official post office and in 1903 extended the building to house the postal facilities.NBRS&P;, 2003, 26 *1900sDifficulties in recruiting labour to the cement plant meant that overseas workers were brought in, \\"adding a cosmopolitan note\\" to the isolated village. The workforce increased from 150 in 1903 to the 1911 figure of 608 employees (including some in the Sydney office) . *1904A new subdivision was laid out in the town. *1904First meeting of the United Labourers Protective Society, later the Railway Workers Union and then the Australian Workers Union.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 12 Scheidel noted that by 1908 that most of the plant's employees were members of the union. *Portland town band formed, with the CPCC supplying most of the uniforms and music, and it became known as the Commonwealth Portland Cement Company's Employees' Band. A grandstand was built for the band on company land in 1910. The local Rifle Club was also supplied with land donated from the company. *1906Portland was gazetted as a town. *1907NSW Governor Lord Northcote visited Portland cement works, followed soon afterwards by His Excellency Admiral Sir Harry Rawson.NBRS&P;, 2003, 24 *An Accident Ward was opened on site to care for victims of accidents on site, and was also open to the general public. According to NBRS&P;, it was likely to have been initially sited in the Casino (2003, p27). The 1910 Annual Report noted that this facility had already saved two lives and alleviated much suffering. But it was expensive to run and Scheidel recommended the company help establish a town hospital. *1909A book entitled \\"To Commemorate the Seventh Congress of Chambers of Commerce of the British Empire held in Sydney, September 1909\\" stated that the cement produced by CPCC was \\"the favourite brand on the NSW market\\" which 'has also secured a considerable share of that of the other states, of New Zealand and of the South Sea Islands. Important public tenders have been secured with the Imperial and Federal Governments, the Public Works Department, the Railway commissioners of NSW, the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage, at Sydney, the Sydney Harbour Trust, the Sydney Municipal Council, the Railway commissioners of Queensland and Victoria, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, the Hobart and Dunedin Drainage Boards and others... A large number of important structures have been, and are at present being built with the Company's cement [including] The Cataract Dam [and] the Burrenjuck Irrigation Scheme in NSW...' By 1912 the company was producing about 40% of Australia's Portland Cement.NBRS&P;, 2003, 24-25 *1910The NSW Premier and the NSW Governor Lord Chelmsford with his wife Lady Chelmsford visited Portland on 11 May and workers were granted a public holiday for the day. *1910The CPCC began providing free electricity to light the main streets of Portland. *1910The police station was built (with help from the company?). *1911A visitor noted that the town was a bit shabby, with most of its retail buildings being relocated from nearby Sunny Corner, which had been shrinking with the end of its gold rushes. However, in this year the CPCC built five houses for its officers. *1912Nearly the e town turned out for the works picnic which was held on the company's recreation ground on the opposite side of Williwa Street, facing the Works site.NBRS&P;, 2003, 27 -see photo p28. *1912The foundation stone for a new town hospital was laid by Scheidel and the Portland District Hospital was officially opened 30 August 1913. The CPCC continued to support the hospital with coal and by encouraging employee fund-raising for occasional new pieces of expensive equipment. From 1924-1946 senior executives of the company provided expertise to the Hospital Board by taking on the roles of president, secretary or treasure. *1914-18WWI meant increased demand for cement because of the cessation of imports from Germany but also a reduction in the available workforce as men went off to war. The number of employees at the plant contracted from 634 in 1912 to 462 in 1917 and there were improved efficiencies. There was considerable increase in labour unrest during these years.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 13 It is interesting to note that Scheidel, though German, was not interned during WWI, as were other Germans in the company including the work's chemist. Notes from the company secretary... Indicate that a donation of A¬£5,000 was made to the war effort to keep Scheidel out of the main camp and allow him to be \\"interned\\" at Portland.NBRS&P;, 2003, 30 *1915There was a one-month-long strike in the works. The first Works Picnic was held in April, in an attempt to improve labour relations. *1915The CPCC further donated land to the Anglican Church for a church hall and rectory. *1915The CPCC established an ambulance service for the town at a time when such a service was rare in the country.NBRS&P;, 2003, 27 *1916Provided the cement for the reinforced concrete floors of the head office of the Commonwealth \\"Moneybox\\" building at 108-120 Pitt Street Sydney. *1917There was a general strike that forced the cement works to close down for two months. Scheidel described it as \\"the most dangerous and disastrous industrial upheaval yet experienced in this country\\". Scheidel was determined that \\"known troublemakers\\" were not to be re-employed when the works re-opened and the union saw this as victimisation. Although labour relations seem to have warmed after the retirement of Scheidel the following year, Annual Reports continued to note occasional strikes and mentioned the activities of \\"communist agitators\\". *1918Scheidel retired and was replaced as Managing Director by John Symonds. The war changed the previously good relations Germans had developed in Australia and as soon as the war was over Scheidel left Australia. Having travelled through Germany and much of Europe he settled in It6aly before returning to Frankfurt, Germany where he died in 1932 *1923The CPCC Annual Report noted the shortage of housing in Portland and by 1925 had built 21 cottages for its employees. *A large new house was built for the Works Manager, John Saville, who held this position from 1903 to 1938. *1926The former residence of the Works Manager was transformed into a boarding house by the company. This house was designated for the use of single teachers in the local school 1932-1950, when it was known as \\"Harmony Hall\\". It was eventually demolished.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 15 *1920sAfter war efficiencies and labour unrest, the 1920s saw increased mechanisation of the plant and a second phase great expansion of the works with new, more efficient combination mills being added to the raw and cement mill operations and no. 8 Rotary Mill operating from 1924. The company continued to prosper even in the face of increased competition arising from the establishment of three new cement companies in NSW (on top of the already established and fiercely competitive Kandos Cement Ltd).Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 13-14 *1928-34Great Depression forced a downsizing of output and workforce. Major maintenance works were undertaken on the plant and works. Up to 80% of employees lost their jobs and many took to fossicking for gold in the hills nearby (a region gold rush during the nineteenth century). The company waived rent for those still living in company housing in 1932.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 14 *1931-32The works supplied much of the cement used in a day labour project to seal the main streets on the town in concrete. *1938only 411 men employed in the plant produced much the same output as the 611 men employed in 1929, as a result of mechanisation and increased efficiencies. *1939-45World War II saw the Commonwealth Government resume a small block of land in Portion 52 fronting Williwa St to build a \\"Munitions Annex\\" for workers in the production of munitions. *Late 1940sThe company changed hands to Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers U.K. (APCM).Lithgow LEP entry A decision was made to change form \\"dry process\\" to \\"wet process\\" and the old plant was decommissioned or refitted and a new No. 1 Rotary kiln installed in 1951.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 16. *1948Town seems to have reached its peak population: 3125. *Industrial unrest in Portland focused around the \\"Butcher Girl Strike\\" defending young woman ill-treated by butcher employerIsrael, 2004 *1958The Portland & District Olympic Pool was built mostly by voluntary labour on land leased by the company to the city, the former site of \\"Harmony Hall\\" opposite the works. The company also provided materials and general assistance. *1959Production capacity of the Works was of cement and of lime.NBRS&P;, 2003, 33 *1960sA new product was developed which was to become the most significant in the Portland Cement range, ultimately marketed under the trade name, \\"Off White\\". However the cement market in Australia was reducing and although this product increased in sales the overall output of cement from the company dropped from per annum in 1974 to in 1979 and in 1983. *1974APCM merged with BHP and formed Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd.Lithgow LEP entry This company also owned cement works at Maldon (near Picton), Charbon and later Berrima. *1981Population: 2194. *1991The operating plant was old and getting less efficient and the production of cement ceased in November although the limestone quarries remained open, and some crushing equipment, for supplying the cement works at Maldon. *1992Blue Circle Southern Cement taken over by Boral. *1993Heritage assessment report focusing on the industrial archaeological values of the site was commissioned by Blue Circle Cement and completed by Peter Fenwick and Kate Holmes. *1998Boral closed down the limestone quarries and began dismantling the plant and rehabilitating the landscape in preparation for sale. Much of the cement works equipment has been taken off the site. *2003Heritage assessment report focusing on the future of the worker's cottages along Williwa Street but also appraising the site generally was commissioned by prospective buyer Lloyd Monck and completed by Colin Israel of Noel Bell Ridley Smith & Partners.NBRS&P.; =1890-1992 Williwa Street Cottages timeline= *First set of workers' accommodation built along Williwa Road, being the old Bachelors' Quarters (No. 3 & 4 Williwa Street) and No. 7 & 8 Williwa Street. They are built during the Cullen Bullen Lime and Cement Company operations, as simple three-room single-storey terrace cottages. The Bachelors' Quarters are constructed as four three-room apartments with shared amenities at the rear. *1900-01A Post Office building is constructed. Originally built to accommodate staff, the building is offered to the Postal Department in 1902 as the district Post Office, a role it plays until 1912. *1900-02Four semi-detached single-storey cottages are built along Williwa Street (5 & 6, 9 & 10, 11 & 12, 13 & 14 Williwa Street). Each is built as four room dwellings; two bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. *1901The Casino (Officers' Mess) is constructed facing Williwa Street, closest to the cement works. Built under Scheidel's instructions to be used by the company's unmarried officers and mechanics for their meals and social gatherings. It consists of two rooms; one for meals and one as a reading room. *The Casino (Officers' Mess) is converted into an accident ward, that is also made available to the general public. *1912A new post office building is constructed in Portland. The old post office in Williwa Street is converted for use by the Bank of New South Wales, with the attached dwelling becoming the bank manager's residence. The bank remains in the building until 1964. *1912Accident ward deals with at least 30 typhoid patients during an epidemic in Portland. *Alterations to the old Bachelors' Quarters includes the addition of a laundry and bathroom at the rear of each apartment. *sOld Bachelors' Quarters is opened up to form two x two bedroom apartments. *1943Land adjoining the Casino is taken up by the Commonwealth Government for construction of a fire arms annex connected to the Small Arms Factory in Lithgow. The annex is one of ten buildings in the district constructed to supply rifle and machine gun components to the Lithgow factory. *1964The Bank of NSW relocates to a new bank building in Portland and the former Post Office building is converted back to accommodation for the cement works. *1974Portland Cement buys back the former small arms annex building and uses it for on-site storage. *1992The cottages begin to be vacated as the cement works begin to close. All cottages are currently empty.GML, SHI entry, 2005 ;Aboriginal people and colonisation Aboriginal occupation of the Blue Mountains area dates back at least 12,000 years and appears to have intensified some 3000‚Äì4000 years ago. In pre-colonial times the region around Portland was inhabited by Aboriginal people of the Wiradjuri linguistic group.NBRS&P;, 9. European settlement in this region after the first documented white expedition west of the Blue Mountains in 1813 was tentative, largely because of concerns about resistance from Aboriginal people. There was contact, evidenced by sporadic hostility and by the quantity of surviving artefacts manufactured by the Aborigines from European glass. By 1840 there was widespread dislocation of Aboriginal culture, aggravated after 1850 by the goldrush to the region.HO and DUAP, 1996, 88. Jack Reed, a long-time resident of Portland, recalls how, as a child in the 1930s, he used to go hunting with two Aboriginal men named Jack and Jimmy. He estimated their birthdates as and their visits to Portland as quite frequent. As part of the day these men would visit rock engravings (since removed) but never allow Jack to go near them. Neither spoke much English and both hunted with spears and boomerangs. Whilte staying at Portland they camped close to the dam near the Portland Golf Course. Jack also remembers occasional groups of Aboriginal people coming to Portland to hold corroborees for the town's people.NBRS&P;, 10. The National Parks & wildlife Service register lists 19 Aboriginal sites in the immediate area of Portland, typically rock shelters or expanses of rock with archaeological deposits and sometimes with art and / or axe-grinding grooves, open sites with scatters of stone artefacts and carved trees. In 1982 two sites containing scatterings of stone artefacts were discovered in East Portland during an archaeological survey of the Ivanhoe Colliery for Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd but these sites were not conserved for various reasons. There have been no Aboriginal sites associated with the Portland Cement Works and Quarries Site. =Portland and cement manufacture in Australia (draft)= Until the early 19th century, lime was the major ingredient used in mortar, which was central to western construction techniques for holding bricks and other building materials in place. In 1824 \\"Portland Cement\\" was developed in England by Joseph Aspdin, who named it after a pale grey coloured rock associated with Portland, England. Portland Cement is made by mixing limestone or chalk with either clay or shale in the right proportions and burning the mixture at 1,400-1,500 degrees Celsius, a point where the mix begins to fuse. The resulting clinker is then ground fine to produce cement. The first large cement works were built in Britain in 1843.National Trust listing card, 1980 Portland Cement was a far superior building product and it caught on quickly in Europe and especially Germany but was infrequently used in Australia before the end of the 19th century. The first recorded manufacture of Portland Cement in Australia was at Tasmania's Maria Island Company, which showed cement samples at the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in 1888. In Victoria David Mitchell was making cement from before 1890 until his death 1916 in Melbourne, although in fairly small quantities. The Portland Cement Co Ltd began production in Fyansford in Victoria in 1890.NBRS&P;, 2003, 16 There is a reference in Australia that locates the earliest experiments with Portland Cement at the Portland site in NSW in 1884 by the Cullen Bullen Lime & Cement Company. However this company was not actually in existence until 1889, although one of its owners, George Raffan, had bought the site in 1882 and the reference may be to his preliminary activities in developing cement manufacture. His Cullen Bullen Lime & Cement Company was the first firm in NSW to successfully manufacture Portland Cement - under the brand name \\"Kangaroo\\" - but the firm was unable to make it at a sufficiently high and even standard to be commercially viable, and its production ceased in 1895. George Raffan reopened the business with his brother John in 1896 as the Ivanhoe Lime and Cement Works & Colliery but this too had failed by 1898.NBRS&P;, 2003, 17. These first cement plants on the Portland site used eight static charge (bottle-shaped) kilns with millstone grinding, powered by a small steam plant. Two of these early bottle kilns - built of brick with iron ties and turnbuckles- and the milling plant in the north west corner of Portion 52 stand as historical monuments to the beginning of the cement industry in NSW.National Trust, 1980. In 1899 the British-owned New Zealand Mines Trust paid A¬£38,000 for the Portland leases and plant at the instigation of Dr August Scheidel, then Consul-General for the Austro- Hungarian Empire in Sydney (the site at Portland was purchased soon afterwards, in 1902). Scheidel, who \\"is considered the father of the modern cement industry in Australia\\", was born in Heidelberg and had received his PhD from Freiberg University in 1880. The Commonwealth Portland Cement Company (CPCC) was established to run the business in December 1900 - just days before Federation - and was possibly the first company in Australia to use the word \\"Commonwealth\\" in its name. 'The cost of initial plant machinery and buildings came to over 150,000 pounds and during the next ten years a further A¬£100,000 would be spent on the plant's expansion'.NBRS&P;, 2003, 18-19. Under the guidance of Scheidel as Managing Director, and with this large injection of capital spending and foreign expertise, the Portland Cement Works Site became one of Australia's largest and longest-running cement manufacturing plants. The only other early cement manufacturer in NSW was Goodlett & Smith, established and located in Granville Sydney from 1901. The CPCC had an \\"agreement\\" with Goodlett & Smith, but this \\"friendly\\" relationship was transformed into one of intense competition after Goodlett & Smith sold out to the NSW Cement Lime & Coal Co in 1918 (first registered in 1913 and in production from 1916) which was re-organised and renamed in 1920 as Kandos Cement Ltd, based in Kandos, near Portland. In addition, three new cement companies were established in NSW during the twenties: the Sulphide Corporation near Newcastle in 1925; Standard at Charbon, also near Portland in 1926; and Southern at Berrima in 1929. In addition, the Victorian-based Portland Cement Co Ltd changed name to Australian Portland Cement in 1905 and had become an aggressive competitor in the cement market by the 1920s. For the first time supply outstripped demand and when the Great Depression hit in the late 1920s, demand for cement plummeted. The impact on the CPCC was at first ameliorated by government works projects to pave roads in cement and to stabilise rivers with cement canals but soon these projects also became scarce. CPCC sales of cement fell from a high of in 1927 out of a total of sold in NSW that year, to a low of in sales for the entire State in 1931... =The role of the cement works in the history of Portland= The development of the township of Portland and its cement works have been closely entwined. The Portland region was earlier known as \\"Limestone Flat\\" but was gazetted as the village of Portland in 1894, just five years after Portland Cement was first manufactured in NSW on this site. Thus the town was undoubtedly named after the product, rather than the other way round (indeed, it was one of about ten towns worldwide that received their name from the manufacture of Portland Cement).NBRS&P;, 2003, 3, 16. 'The town of Portland and the Works were almost synonymous. As the Works grew and prospered the town grew and prospered with the CPCC assisting in the establishment of much of the town's infrastructure. Scheidel was a pioneer in public relations and is quoted in the 1909 Annual Report as saying \\"it is to the advantage of the Company to make life in Portland more and more enjoyable\\". 'The Works were almost totally self-sufficient. Water for the site was piped from company built dams on the site, the Colliery supplied all the fuel requirements of the kilns and power house, electricity was generated, sufficient to supply both the Works and the town, limestone and shale quarries were almost adjacent to the plant and the company built a railway line to connect the Works to the main railway and operated its own locomotives'. 'For most employees, staying in Portland meant working at the cement factory. Two and even three generations of the same family worked there'. Some commentators noted a close and warm association between the company and the township, while others were less optimistic: \\"When some long-time employees were asked about the company as an employer, the initial reaction was silence, and then the reply, that there was little choice\\". The closure of the works in 1991 had an impact on the town of Portland and the economy of the region but alternative employment opportunities had begun to arise, principally at the Wallerawang and Mount Piper Power Stations, and the town seems to have survived. It is, no doubt, a cleaner and quieter place without the operation of a cement work almost in its centre. =Comparative analysis of Portland with other single-industry towns in NSW= Portland is unusual in NSW for its homogeneity as a one-industry, indeed one-company town (even if that company did change hands several times over the century). Other examples of single industry towns in NSW are: Port Kembla, which is closely identified with the steel industry and BHP but is more diverse than Portland because of its closeness to the city of Wollongong; Cobar, associated with copper, but with a variety of companies involved; Burraga, south west of Oberon, another copper region but with looser ties than Portland between the industry and the township...  Description  The Portland Cement Works & Quarries Site is a large historical industrial site set in the centre of the town of Portland, some 27 km north west of Lithgow, just west of the Blue Mountains. The cement works closed down in 1991 and the last lime quarry was decommissioned in 1998. About 30 titles of land can be found within the area examined by the 1993 industrial archaeological study of the site by Fenwick & Holmes - of this about half the site is now owned by Boral and the other half is Crown land leased by Boral, however Boral has a closure plan in place. The cement works originally occupied a large area of Lots 52 and 53 Volume 5461 Folio 163. However, the removal of much of the physical fabric of the cement works following its closure, and the rehabilitation and inundation of the quarry sites has reduced the curtilage of the works to only include the main Processing and Administrative Precinct that was decommissioned in 1995. Evidence of the ineteenth century phase of the use of the site is separately listed as Raffans Mill and Brick Bottle Kilns. The key elements of the twentieth century phase are: * the Powerhouse; * the Chimney or Boiler Stack; * the Ambulance Station or oil store, 1902; * the Blacksmiths Workshop ; * Electricians Store or Dining Room; * the Fitters Workshop; * the Administration Building ; * the locker/shower room; * the rectangular cement silo or No. 2 Cement Silo, (No. 2 Silos); [May need to be demolished because structurally unsound] * the eight cylindrical cement silos; * the Railway Loading Shed and Locomotive (or Engine or Loco) Shed, East and West; [May need to be demolished because structurally unsound] * the Crusher Building s; * Residential buildings including: workers' cottages built by the Cullen Bullen Lime Cement Company during the 1890s (nos 3, 4, 7 & 8 Williwa Street); workers' cottages built by the Commonwealth Portland Cement Company after 1901 (nos 1, 2, 5, 6, 9-14 Williwa Street) * \\"Casino\\" or officer's recreation rooms . * Ammunitions (or Fire Arms) Annex, 1943. [May need to be demolished because economically unfeasible for adpative re-use]. Four former lime quarries, which are sited nearby within the Fenwick & Holmes study area, now have stepped back walls and filled with water, and surrounded by rehabilitation plantings to minimise their danger. Quarries 1, 2 and 4 are all about 70 metres deep while Quarry 3 is about deep and was used to retain drainage for the town. The cement plant buildings including the Powerhouse were constructed largely of materials obtained on the site including clay for bricks. The Powerhouse's iron girders were imported from England from the same manufacturer as supplied the Eveleigh Street Railway Yards. =Buildings considered to have structural problems= Fenwick & Holmes (1993, 63) have recommended that \\"every effort should be made to retain\\" the rectangular Cement Storage Silo (a brick building with gable ends and a galvanised tin roof, some 50m x 13m in dimension, and that forms part of the row of plant buildings to the east of the Powerhouse). However this building is argued by Noel Bell Ridley Smith to have major structural problems along with the Railway Loading Shed and the Locomotive (or Engine or Loco) Shed.NBRS, 2003, 85. Godden Mackay Logan agrees with NBRS that the rectangular cement silo is structurally unsound. However heritage engineer Peter Benkendorff is of the opinion that the building is or great heritage interest and is fundamentally sound and should be retained. NBRS identified the workers cottages at Nos 3 and 4 Williwa Street to have severe structural damage requiring their demolition.NBRS, 2003, 89. =Moveable heritage - museum collection= There is a further important element that is currently off-site and not included in this listing but may constitute an important issue associated with the conservation of the site: the many items of moveable heritage discarded from the site over the years that have been amassed in a substantial collection stored off-site by former employee Charlie Pinch, and that have been dedicated to the people of Portland. The SHR listing will support future applications for funding to conserve, catalogue and exhibit this collection. = Condition = As at 5 May 2005, the Portland Cement Plant Processing and Administrative Precinct buildings, works and infrastructure range from being in good condition to poor, even dangerous, conditions. The main series of buildings, including the Powerhouse, Chimney, Administration Building and Locker/Shower Room, are all in good condition. The site has some archaeological potential to show locations, footings and remains of the earlier stages of the cement- making process on the site. The Processing and Administrative Precinct of the Portland Cement Works has been significantly dismantled but retains many significant elements. Although the site has ceased to operate as a cement works, the spatial aspect of the remaining buildings, including their frontage to Williwa Street, the T-shaped layout of the works and the remnant rail tracks all combine to provide information on the operation of the site and the scale of the original works. The proximity of the works to the town of Portland and the location of the municipal pool across the road from the main entrance serve to act as links between the works and the town itself. The remaining chimney also acts as a landmark feature for the town and district. = Modifications and dates = The Portland Cement Works has undergone a series of modifications and updates during its operational history. A number of the buildings remaining within the Processing and Administrative Precinct date from the 1902 phase of development, when Scheidel built his new plant. Buildings from this phase include the Powerhouse, Locomotive Shed, Administration Building, blacksmith's workshops and ambulance station. The Powerhouse was originally built as two separate buildings, but joined by 1910. The southern end of the building was also extended around the same time. Also at this time, the overhead gantry crane was extended through the entire Powerhouse. A number of changes were made internally over the operation period of the Powerhouse to support new machinery. The other buildings within this precinct underwent little change during their operation. The last major change was after 1991, when the plant was gradually closed down. Much of the operating machinery was removed to other sites. The main mill buildings were removed before 2003.  Heritage listing  As at 17 May 2005, the Portland Cement Works Site is of State significance as the remnants of a cultural landscape that evidences the history of one of Australia's most successful lime quarrying and cement manufacture enterprises - an enterprise which generated a product crucial to the construction of many important structures in NSW throughout the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 1995 the site provided both raw materials from its own quarries and a place for the long- term, large-scale production of world-quality cement, using a succession of both local and imported machinery and labour. This industrial site led to the establishment and naming of the town of Portland and has contributed to its civic and social development since the late nineteenth century. This relationship between industry and local population is of State significance because of its rarity within NSW as a long-term, single-industry, one-company town, and because the relationship is evident in the layout of the town and in many of its civic amenities (from workers cottages and concrete roads to the municipal swimming pool). While the (former) Portland Cement Works Site is of local significance as \\"the heart of Portland\\", it is of State significance for begetting \\"the town that built NSW\\". See also Raffan's Mill and Brick Bottle Kiln - related listing. Portland Cement Works Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Portland Cement Works Site is of State significance as the site of one of Australia's most successful, long-term lime quarrying and cement manufacture enterprises, which generated a product crucial to the construction of many important structures in NSW throughout the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 1995 the site provided both raw materials from its own quarries and a place for the long-term large-scale production of world-quality cement, using a succession of both local and imported machinery and labour. The cement manufacturing plant developed by Dr Scheidel on the site at the turn of the twentieth century is of historical significance for having incorporated international technology such as the coal-fired rotary kilns, which were just being developed in Germany. When installed in 1902 Portland was then at the leading edge of cement manufacturing technology in the world. This industrial site led to the establishment and naming of the town of Portland and has contributed to its civic and social development since the late nineteenth century. This relationship between industry and local population is of State significance because of its rarity within NSW as a long-term, single-industry, one-company town. The company's significant role in the development of the town is evident in a number of civic projects and amenities in Portland including the workers' cottages included in the curtilage, the Municipal Pool, the Anglican Church site and concreted roads. The (former) Portland Cement Works and Quarries Site may be of local significance as \\"the heart of Portland\\", but is of State significance for begetting \\"the town that built NSW\\". The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Portland Cement Works Site is of State significance for its association with Dr August Scheidel, a metallurgist PhD, who has been described as the father of the modern cement industry in Australia. Scheidel obtained the capital to rebuild the cement works at Portland and, under his direction, make it one of Australia's most successful cement producing plants prior to WW II. As Managing Director he combined the expertise of building, mining and engineering professionals with the then recently developed German tunnel kilns to establish an efficient manufacturing plant for Portland. The site also has associations with local pioneers in the cement manufacturing industry, such as John Symonds and John Saville, as well as with the NSW Governor Lord Chelmsford, who visited Portland in 1913, apparently in honour of the site's contribution to NSW's building industry. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The remnant industrial buildings on the Portland Cement Works Site are of State significance as a complex of industrial buildings from throughout the twentieth century. The group includes representative examples of Federation and Inter War period industrial buildings and buildings constructed in brickwork with fine steel trusses and which demonstrate the quality of workmanship and functional design applied to large-scale industrial engineering projects. The smaller scale Victorian / Federation period buildings have aesthetic significance as vernacular company buildings of several types and scales demonstrating the symbiotic relationship of a large industrial company to its host town. The Williwa Street cottages are of State significance as representative Federation era cottages that help demonstrate the social stratification of the company town. The site contains many industrial remnants from its long and varied history of cement manufacture that add to the technical significance of its heritage. The Powerhouse chimney is a local landmark within the town of Portland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Portland Cement Works Site is of State significance for the social significance of the unusually close relationship it represents between the company and the township. It is also of local social significance to the people of Portland for whom the works were central to their everyday lives in financial, environmental, social and civic interrelationships. The site remains of significance to those whose family members and friends were killed and injured in the often dangerous operations of quarrying and cement manufacture. The dimensions of this social significance would be well examined in a substantial program of oral history research. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Portland Cement Works Site is of State significance for its research potential associated with its rare industrial archaeological features and for its surviving documentation relating to the production of cement in a highly successful, large-scale and continually evolving enterprise which lasted over a century. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The relationship between industry and local population in the Portland Cement Works Site is of State significance because of its rarity within NSW as a long-term, single-industry, one-company town. The site is an outstanding example of an industrial enterprise interrelated with the genesis and development of a rural town, to the extent that the town itself was named after the company's most successful product, and many of its civic amenities were provided by the company (from church site and electricity to cement roads and municipal pool) while the town of course supplied the labour crucial to the company's long-term successful operation. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Even in its partially dismantled state, the Portland Cement Works Site is of State significance as a fine example of its type displaying many of the principal characteristics of a cement manufacturing plant. The Williwa Street cottages are of significance as representative Federation period cottages that demonstrate the social stratification of this company town in the early twentieth century.

Personal life In 1941, Baker was born in New Zealand to a wealthy, noble family of Catholics. He was a lifelong bachelor. In 2011, Hanif Sanket of Bangladesh Television produced a documentary about Baker and his medical work in Madhupur Upazila. This led the Bangladeshi government to change legislation so the doctor could be granted Bangladeshi citizenship (in addition to his New Zealander citizenship) in recognition of Baker's \\"selfless service to the people of Bangladesh\\". He was subsequently interviewed by Ityadi. Ill since 2011, Baker was diagnosed with incurable idiopathic pulmonary hypertension in 2014. He died at his Kailakuri Health Care Centre at 74 years old on 1 September 2015 at around 2:15pm. He was survived by his mother, two sisters, and four brothers‚Äîall in New Zealand. The doctor was buried on 8 September 2015 behind his house at Kailakuri. Career Baker received his Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery from University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine in 1965. He then served with a government medical team in Qui Nh∆°n and Kon Tum, tending to civilian casualties of the Vietnam War. Baker's work in the war ended with four months in a North Vietnamese prison before that nation deported him. In 1975, he went to Australia and England to study pediatrics. Driven by his Christianity, Baker moved to Bangladesh in 1979 because of its \\"really good\\" people and their inability to receive healthcare due to poverty. After working in Meherpur District and Mirzapur, Baker established the Kailakuri Health Care Centre in Madhupur Upazila in 1983. The doctor was renowned for charging only 5‚Äì (equivalent to approximately ‚Äì United States dollars in ) for physical examinations, and providing his patients with needed medicine whether they could pay or not. The clinic received donations from New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. For his devotion to the local Bangladeshis, they called Baker \\"Doctor Brother\\" (). By 2011, Baker was ill and awaiting a physician to replace him; when he died in 2015, none had arrived.

Lindsay, and Helen Pluckrose‚Äîto highlight poor scholarship and eroding criteria in several academic fields. Taking place over 2017 and 2018, their project entailed submitting bogus academic papers to academic journals in cultural, queer, race, gender, fat, and sexuality studies to determine if they would pass through peer review and be accepted for publication. Several of these papers were subsequently published, which the authors cited in support of their contention. Prior to the affair, expressing concerns about the intellectual validity of much research influenced by postmodern philosophy and critical theory, various academics highlighted this by publishing hoax articles in various journals. One of the most noted examples was Alan Sokal's 1996 hoax in Social Text, a cultural studies journal, which inspired Boghossian, Lindsay, and Pluckrose. The trio's intent was to expose problems in \\"grievance studies\\", a term they apply to academic areas in which they claim \\"a culture has developed in which only certain conclusions are allowed...and put social grievances ahead of objective truth.\\" As such, the trio, identifying themselves as leftists and liberals, described their project as an attempt to raise awareness for what they believed was the damage that postmodernism and identity politics-based scholarship was having on leftist political projects. Boghossian, Lindsay, and Pluckrose wrote 20 articles that promoted deliberately absurd ideas or morally questionable acts and submitted them to various peer-reviewed journals. Although they had planned for the project to run until January 2019, the trio admitted to the hoax in October 2018 after journalists from The Wall Street Journal revealed that \\"Helen Wilson\\", the pseudonym used for their article published in Gender, Place & Culture, did not exist. By the time of the reveal, 4 of their 20 papers had been published; 3 had been accepted but not yet published; 6 had been rejected; and 7 were still under review. Included among the articles that were published were arguments that dogs engage in rape culture and that men could reduce their transphobia by anally penetrating themselves with sex toys as well as Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf rewritten in feminist language. The first of these had won special recognition from the journal that published it. The hoax received a polarized reception within academia. Some academics praised it for exposing flaws that they saw as widespread among sectors of the humanities and social sciences influenced by postmodernism, critical theory, and identity politics. Others criticised what they perceived as the unethical nature of submitting deliberately bogus research. Some critics also asserted that the work did not represent a scientific investigation given that the project did not include a control group, further arguing that invalid arguments and poor standards of peer-review were not restricted to \\"grievance studies\\" subjects but found across much of academia.  \\"Grievance studies\\" and \\"applied postmodernism\\"  Through their series of hoax articles, James A. Lindsay, Peter Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose intended to expose issues in what they term as grievance studies, a subcategory of academic areas where the three believe \\"a culture has developed in which only certain conclusions are allowed...and put social grievances ahead of objective truth.\\" The trio referred to several academic fields‚Äîpostcolonial theory, gender studies, queer theory, critical race theory, intersectional feminism, and fat studies‚Äîas \\"grievance studies\\" because, according to Pluckrose, such areas begin \\"from the assumption of a grievance\\" and then bend \\"the available theories to confirm it.\\" Pluckrose argued that all of these fields derive their underlying theoretical perspectives from the postmodern philosophy that developed in the late 1960s. Focusing on the work of French postmodern philosopher Michel Foucault, she highlighted how he argued that knowledge and power were interwoven and emphasised the role of discourse in society. Pluckrose suggested that fields such as postcolonial theory and queer theory could be called applied postmodernism in that they sprung up largely in the late 1980s as a means of pushing the gains of the civil rights movement, gay-rights movement, and liberal feminism from the arena of legislative change and into the territory of changing discourse. She argued that these fields adapted postmodernism to suit their activist agendas. From postmodernism, they adopted the idea that knowledge is a social construct, but at the same time they held to the view that \\"no progress could be made unless some things were objectively true.\\" Thus, the \\"applied postmodernists\\", Pluckrose argued, insisted that \\"systems of power and privilege that oppressed women, people of colour and the LGBT\\" are objectively real and could be revealed by analysing discourses. At the same time, she argued, they retained postmodernism's scepticism toward science and objective knowledge, its view of \\"society as a system of power and privilege,\\" and \\"commitment to the belief that all imbalances are socially constructed,\\" rather than arising from biological reality. Pluckrose described herself and her collaborators as being \\"left-wing liberal sceptics.\\" She stated that a core reason for why they wanted to carry out the project was to convince other \\"leftist academics\\" that there was a problem with \\"corrupted scholarship\\" in academic fields that were \\"based on identity politics and postmodernism.\\" She argued that in rejecting modernism, much postmodernist-derived scholarship was also rejecting science, reason, and liberal democracy, and thus undermining many important progressive gains. Pluckrose also expressed concern that, in both foregrounding the importance of group identity and facilitating the growth of post-truth by claiming that there is no objective truth, this postmodernist theory was contributing to \\"the reactionary surge to the right\\" seen in many countries during the 2010s. In 2020, Pluckrose and Lindsay further investigated the effects of critical theory in their book Cynical Theories: How Universities Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity‚Äîand Why This Harms Everybody.  Sequence of events  By the time of the reveal, 4 of their 20 papers had been published; 3 had been accepted but not yet published; 6 had been rejected; and 7 were still under review. Included among the articles that were published were arguments that dogs engage in rape culture and that men could reduce their transphobia by anally penetrating themselves with sex toys, as well as Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf rewritten in feminist language. One of the published papers in particular had won special recognition from the journal that published it. = Attempts = Prior to the affair, expressing concerns about the intellectual validity of much research influenced by postmodern philosophy and critical theory, various academics highlighted this by publishing hoax articles in various journals. It was the 1996 hoax by Alan Sokal in Social Text, in particular, that influenced James A. Lindsay and Peter Boghossian to publish a hoax article of their own. On May 19, 2017, peer-reviewed journal Cogent Social Sciences published \\"The conceptual penis as a social construct\\", which argued that penises are not \\"male\\"; rather, they should be analyzed as social constructs instead. The same day, Lindsay and Boghossian revealed it to be a hoax aimed at discrediting gender studies, although Cogent Social Sciences is not exclusively a gender studies journal. While the journal did conduct a postmortem, both authors concluded the \\"impact [of the hoax] was very limited, and much criticism of it was legitimate.\\" Peter Boghossian lecturing in 2012 The authors claim to have started their second attempt on August 16, 2017, with Helen Pluckrose joining them in September. The new methodology called for the submission of multiple papers, each of which would be submitted to \\"higher-ranked journals;\\" if it were rejected, feedback from the peer-review process was used to revise the paper before it was submitted to a lower-ranked journal. This process was repeated until the paper was accepted, or until the three authors gave up on that paper. The authorship of each paper was either fictional‚Äîsuch as \\"Helen Wilson\\" of \\"Portland Ungendering Research Initiative\\"‚Äîor real people willing to lend their name, such as Dr. Richard Baldwin, professor emeritus of history at Gulf Coast State College. Over the course of the project, 20 papers were submitted and 48 \\"new submissions\\" of those papers were made. The first acceptance, \\"Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity at the Dog Park\\", was achieved five months after the project began. During the initial peer review for its second, and ultimately successful, attempt at publication in Gender, Place & Culture, what the hoaxers called the \\"Dog Park\\" paper was praised by the first reviewer as \\"incredibly innovative, rich in analysis, and extremely well-written and organized.\\" Similar respectful feedback was provided for other accepted papers. = Discovery of hoax = The project was intended to run until January 31, 2019, but came to a premature end. On June 7, 2018, the Twitter account \\"New Real Peer Review\\" discovered one of their papers. This brought it to the attention of reporters at The College Fix, Reason, and other news outlets who began trying to contact the fictional author and journal it was published in. The journal Gender, Place & Culture published a note on August 6, 2018, stating that it suspected \\"Helen Wilson\\" had breached their contract to \\"not [fabricate] or [misappropriate] anyone's identity, including [their] own,\\" adding that \\"the author has not responded to our request to provide appropriate documentation confirming their identity.\\" According to the trio, another journal and a reporter at The Wall Street Journal were also asking for proof of identity at this point, and that it was the right time to go public; they admitted the hoax to the journalist in early August. When The Wall Street Journal report went public on October 2, the trio released an essay describing their project, as well as a Google Drive archive of most of their papers and email correspondence which included reviewer comments. Simultaneously, filmmaker Mike Nayna released a video on YouTube revealing the story behind the project; Nayna and producer Mark Conway are working on a documentary film about the project.  Reactions  The authors' reaction to coverage of the affair in The New York Times, and further related discussion The project drew both praise and criticism. Science writer Tom Chivers suggested that the result was a \\"predictable furore\\", whereby those already sceptical of gender studies hailed it as evidence for \\"how the whole field is riddled with nonsense\\", while those sympathetic to gender studies thought it was \\"dishonestly undermining good scholarship.\\" Yascha Mounk, author and associate professor of the practice of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University, dubbed it 'Sokal squared' in reference to the Sokal affair hoax accomplished by Alan Sokal, and said that the \\"result is hilarious and delightful. It also showcases a serious problem with big parts of academia.\\" Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker said the project posed the question \\"is there any idea so outlandish that it won't be published in a Critical/PoMo/Identity/'Theory' journal?\\" In contrast, Joel P. Christensen and Matthew A. Sears, both associate professors of Classics, referred to it as \\"the academic equivalent of the fraudulent hit pieces on Planned Parenthood\\" produced in 2015, more interested in publicity than valid argumentation. = Responses by the editors of the publishing journals = Ann Garry, a co-editor of Hypatia, which had accepted one of the hoax papers (\\"When the Joke's on You\\", which purported to be a feminist critique of hoaxes) but had not published it yet, said she was \\"deeply disappointed\\" by the hoax. Garry told The New York Times that \\"Referees put in a great deal of time and effort to write meaningful reviews, and the idea that individuals would submit fraudulent academic material violates many ethical and academic norms.\\" Nicholas Mazza, editor of the Journal of Poetry Therapy, said: \\"Although a valuable point was learned regarding the authenticity of articles/authors ... the authors of the 'study' clearly engaged in flawed and unethical research.\\" = Praise = Yascha Mounk of Johns Hopkins University said that while the authors received no favors for preparing the hoax, they demonstrated mastery in postmodern jargon and not only ridiculed the journals in question, but, more important, outed double standards of gender studies which happily welcome hoaxes against \\"morally suspect\\" fields like economics, but are unable to accept a criticism of their own methods. He also noted the \\"sheer amount of tribal solidarity it has elicited among leftists and academics\\" and the fact that many of the reactions were purely ad hominem, while few have actually noted that there is an actual problem highlighted by the hoax: \\"some of the leading journals in areas like gender studies have failed to distinguish between real scholarship and intellectually vacuous as well as morally troubling bullshit.\\" Mounk also countered criticism which the trio received about the lack of controls as a \\"confused attempt to import statistics into a question where it doesn't apply.\\" Justin E. H. Smith defended the provocation and gave examples from the past in which hoaxes were used to disclose poor scientific practices in respected fields. In The Chronicle of Higher Education, Heather E. Heying pointed out that the hoax helped to expose many pathologies of the modern social sciences, such as \\"repudiation of science and logic\\" and \\"extolling activism over inquiry.\\" Upon Boghossian's employer Portland State University initiating a research misconduct inquiry, on the grounds of conducting human subject-based research without approval, and further considering a charge of fabricating data, a number of prominent academics submitted letters of support to him and defended the motive of the hoax, including Steven Pinker and various Portland State students. Richard Dawkins compared an initiation of \\"misconduct enquiry\\" into Boghossian, to that of initiating an enquiry into George Orwell for writing his satirical work Animal Farm, because it attributes to pigs the ability to walk on their hind legs, chanting 'Four legs good, two legs better'. He asked: Psychologist Jonathan Haidt stated that the inquiry would be \\"a profound moral error‚Äîan injustice‚Äîthat will be obvious to all who hear about your decision, and that will have bad effects upon the public perception of PSU and of universities in general,\\" and concluded that Boghossian and his co-authors are whistleblowers, who undertook a \\"career-risking project to stand up for academic integrity by exposing what is, arguably, an academic subculture that tolerates intellectual fraud.\\" Philosopher Daniel Dennett stated that Boghossian's targets \\"could learn a few things about academic integrity\\" from his \\"fine example,\\" undertaken \\"in good faith.\\" Alan Sokal and Jordan Peterson also supported Boghossian. = Criticism = Writing for Slate, Daniel Engber criticized the project, saying that \\"one could have run this sting on almost any empirical discipline and returned the same result.\\" Similarly, Sarah Richardson, Harvard University professor of women's studies, criticized the hoaxers for not including a control group in their experiment, telling BuzzFeed News, \\"By their own standards, we can't scientifically conclude anything from it.\\" n+1 magazine published a critical article that cited a survey by science writer Jim Schnabel of similar hoax attempts, summarizing Schnabel's conclusion as \\"the educated public makes a decision based not on the scientific merits of the hoax but on the relative orthodoxy of the hoaxer and hoaxee. In effect, the result of the trick is decided in advance by the power relations of the field.\\" The article goes on to assert that the relative orthodoxy in this case was \\"not an orthodoxy of scientific legitimacy but rather the emerging consensus of tech bros, Davos billionaires, and alt-right misogynists.\\" In UnHerd, Chivers noted that while the so-called \\"grievance studies\\" fields \\"probably\\" contain more \\"bullshit...than most scientific fields,\\" the project distracted attention from problems of shoddy scholarship across the entirety of academia. He highlighted that several weeks prior to the project's public revelation, professor of food behaviour Brian Wansink had resigned from his position at Cornell University following exposure of instances of scientific misconduct on his part. Carl T. Bergstrom, writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, says \\"the hoaxers appear woefully na√Øve about how the system actually works.\\" Peer review is not designed to remove fraud or even absurd ideas, he claimed, and replication will lead to self-correction. In the same article, David Schieber said he was one of the two anonymous reviewers for \\"Rubbing One Out\\", and argued that the hoaxers selectively quoted from his review. \\"They were turning my attempt to help the authors of a rejected paper into an indictment of my field and the journal I reviewed for, even though we rejected the paper.\\" A number of professors at Portland State University signed an open letter which accused the trio of exploiting \\"credulous journalists interested mainly in spectacle\\" to conduct academic fraud and dishonesty. \\"[B]asic spite and a perverse interest in public humiliation seem to have overridden any actual scholarly goals.\\" The authors asked to remain anonymous, alleging Boghossian had targeted academics at other institutions and that they would likely receive \\"threats of death and assault from online trolls.\\"  List of hoax papers  = Accepted =  Published  Following the discovery of the hoax, all four papers were retracted: * ''''''  *  Not yet published   * = Considered =  Revise and resubmit     Under review  * = Rejected =     *  See also  * Fashionable Nonsense * Cynical Theories * Postmodernism Generator * List of scholarly publishing stings  References   External links  * Grievance studies on Peter Boghossians webpage * Collection of the papers, reviews and press material on Google Drive Category:Academic scandals Category:2017 hoaxes Category:2018 hoaxes Category:Criticism of postmodernism Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Grievance studies affair"},{"id":"58713633","text":"An operator A on an (infinite dimensional) Banach space or Hilbert space H has a cyclic vector f if the vectors f, Af, A2f,... span H.

The New Hanseatic League developed from an informal cooperation among like-minded fiscally conservative northern European states that has also been referred to at various points as 'The Vikings' and the 'Bad Weather coalition'. The grouping sees clubbing together as a way to make up for the loss of the like-minded Britain in the European political arena after Brexit. The countries involved want a more developed European single market, particularly in the services sector (i.e. a so-called 'Capital Markets Union'). They also want to develop the European Stability Mechanism into a full European Monetary Fund that would redistribute wealth from trade surplus to trade deficit EU member states. A number of think tanks - including Free Trade Europa - support this policy approach In a speech delivered in the Netherlands, Ireland's T√°naiste (deputy head of government) Simon Coveney suggested cooperation among the countries in the alliance could extend to foreign policy as well, such as the Middle East peace process and the EU's relations with Africa. Some have expressed fears the New Hanseatic League could exacerbate existing north-south political divides in Europe by grouping northern European countries too closely. A more recent fiscally conservative group of EU nations exists in an informal setting, dubbed the Frugal Four. It consists of some of the New Hanseatic League member nations plus Austria. In November 2018, the New Hanseatic group called for the European Stability Mechanism to be given a greater role in scrutinising national budgets. Under the plan, formal tests of a government‚Äôs debt sustainability and ability to repay would be carried out before aid could be provided. The call came after the European Commission's rejection of Italy's 2019 budget, and was signed by all eight members of the League, along with two additional signatures from Czechia and Slovakia.

He is the founder and festival director of Dehradun Literature Festival. He is widely known for social work, particularly with regards to menstrual hygiene.  Works  In 2015, Chauhan started a project called WASH (Women, Sanitation, Hygiene) that works to educate women about menstrual hygiene, providing them sanitary napkins and training them to make bio- degradable sanitary napkins. The workshop is led by doctors to tell the women about biological reasons behind menstruation, hormonal changes, about various stages right from teenage to menopause. Counselling is given to women particularly who are dealing with menopause. Nutritionists tell women and girls about importance of food & nutrition intake. Affordability and sustainability are big issues, which is why they train the women to make their own sanitary napkins at home. The workshop also covers the harmful effects of poor menstrual hygiene and teach about the disposal of napkins. In 2018, WASH started Breaking The Bloody Taboo campaign where, as the name suggests, Anurag and his team strive to strip women of the age-old taboos. During one such campaign in Rajasthan, the volunteers conducted a session inside a temple with women of menstruating age. In another session, Anurag handed over tulsi saplings to women and asked them to nurture the sapling for a month and then see the results. Chauhan started this project after reading an article written about deaths caused due to lack of menstruation hygiene. His cause received support from actress Twinkle Khanna. Chauhan runs awareness programs in many villages, slums, schools and colleges of Uttarakhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. During the nationwide lockdown the efforts of Humans for Humanity has come as a great help to the women who have been taught how to make sanitary napkins at home as they don‚Äôt have to go out and buy them but they can make hygienic sanitary pads themselves at home. They have reached a new level of empowerment as they are not dependent on the outside world to maintain a healthy menstrual cycle. Anurag is an example how youth of India are breaking the stereotype associated with menstrual hygiene by touching lives of those who need awareness and education by honesty, dedication and a will do bring a positive change. Anurag is indeed the real life Padman. Stigmas, combined with financial restraints, further add to the neglected state of menstrual health. The WASH project by Humans For Humanity is actively working in six states and has employed women from the villages, making them financially self-sufficient. The eco friendly, reusable cloth pads last up to 2-2.5 years and come as part of a kit that also has liners, undergarments, soap bars & a guide. Hundreds of community workers, women, self help groups & ngos have been given online workshop to make sanitary napkins by Humans For Humanity during the lockdown. Anurag‚Äôs efforts being a man have been immense in making these women become self-reliant.  Other  Chauhan acted in a film as a lead actor, shot in Rajasthan. The film is based on Clean India Campaign, an initiative by PM Narendra Modi. In 2016, he launched the Dehradun Literature Festival, an annual literary fest in Dehradun. Ruskin Bond and Shobhaa De are the ambassadors of the festival. In September, 2017, Chauhan started an online social media campaign, #TheDoorChallenge, to promote rich Indian cultural heritage and traditional Indian attire among youngsters. The challenge went viral and was well received by an international audience and garnered support from many countries such as Australia, Canada and Bangladesh. In April, 2020, Chauhan started India's 1st online Virtual Literature Festival, during the nationwide lockdown due to coronavirus, to promote rich Indian cultural heritage, literature and arts among the people stuck at home. The festival was very well received by a huge audience and garnered people's support from all walks of life. His efforts were applauded by the audiences for taking an initiative to bring out content that helped many during the time they felt low & lonely. Actress Lisa Ray, Laxmi Agarwal, Bollywood choreographer Sandip Soparrkar, Shobhaa De, Sonal Mansingh, Divya Dutta were amongst many others who participated in the fest. In June, 2020 the Virtual Literature Festival was launched as a Poscast series by Chauhan with RedFM on multiple platforms such RedFM app, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, Spotify & JioSaavn. In June, 2020 Chauhan launched a virtual series called Women of India in collaboration with UN Women to talk about various topics concerning women. The inaugural session was attended by Kiran Bedi.

It was established by The Stehr Group in the year 2000, and became the first Australian company in the sector to be listed on the ASX (2005). The company was established by \\"tuna baron\\" Hagen Stehr, whose son Marcus (as of 2018) remains one of the company's directors. Its ambition to control and commercialise the lifecycle of the Southern bluefin tuna has not been realised.  Facilities  Clean Seas has shore and sea-based fish farming facilities at Arno Bay, aquaculture leases in Fitzgerald Bay and a processing facility at Royal Park in Adelaide.  History  Clean Seas was formed by The Stehr Group in 2000. Clean Seas Tuna Ltd was floated on the ASX in 2005 with the ambition of controlling the lifecycle of the Southern bluefin tuna. As of 2018 it is yet to accomplish this. In 2008, Stehr told the ABC that he had expansion plans for the company. He said \\"We got the marina [in] close proximity to Adelaide, and it is a natural progression for our company to move that side... We either move to Wallaroo or direct to Adelaide.\\" He also expressed his concerns about a proposal from mining company Centrex Metals to export iron ore from Port Lincoln. Centrex Metals' iron ore mining and export plans did not eventuate. Hagen Stehr, the founder of Clean Seas, stepped down from his position as Chairman of Clean Seas Tuna in 2009. At the time, he said that the company was transitioning from a research and development company to commercialisation. The company reported a $12 million loss in 2009. In September 2010, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Clean Seas staff killed 80 tonnes of stock as a result of human error while \\"bathing\\" the fish in hydrogen peroxide. The company reported a first-half loss of $14 million that year, and a loss of over $15 million for the year to June 30. In November 2010, Stehr told The Advertiser that he took responsibility for the over- production of kingfish which adversely impacted the company's finances. At that time, the company's Chairman was John Ellice-Flint, and its Managing Director was Clifford Ashby. In 2011, Clean Seas reported a $9.3 million loss for the latter half of 2010. In mid 2012, Clean Seas was seeking an investment partner to help the company to expand and reach new markets. Later that year, the company's share price was near its all-time low value of two cents per share, following a series of fish health and mortality problems. Clean Seas workforce was halved to lower operating costs. In February 2013, Stehr remained optimistic about Clean Seas prospects for closing the life-cycle of the Southern bluefin tuna. The company suspended its Southern bluefin tuna propagation research as a cost-cutting measure after it revealed it had made a $34 million statutory loss for the last half of 2012. In 2014, Clean Seas Yellowtail kingfish operations were accredited as \\"sustainable\\" by Friend of the Sea. In 2015, Clean Seas was investigating the prospect of establishing fish farms for Yellowtail kingfish and Yellowfin tuna near the Abrolhos Islands in Western Australia and Yellowtail kingfish at Wallaroo in South Australia. At that time, the company's objective was to be able to grow and sell 3,000 tonnes of Hiramasa per year. In 2016, Clean Sea Tuna Ltd became Clean Seas Seafood Ltd, with the company refocusing entirely on Yellowtail kingfish. In 2017, it rebranded its product Spencer Gulf Hiramasa Kingfish and established new facilities at Royal Park, South Australia. As of September 2017, Hagen Stehr remains the company's largest shareholder, which he holds through the entity Australian Tuna Fisheries. In 2018, Clean Seas' directors were confident about the prospects for their Hiramasa business, and planned to resume farming in Fitzgerald Bay, near Whyalla in August of that year. In November 2018, Clean Seas signed a distribution agreement with Chinese seafood distributor, Hunchun Haiyun Trading Co Ltd. In 2019, Clean Seas was recognised by Business SA as South Australia's Exporter of the Year. It sold approximately 2,700 tonnes of kingfish that year, with around 45 per cent of that exported. Europe was the largest export market at that time. Clean Seas works with high profile chefs and restaurants in the marketing of their product, including chefs Giovanni Pilu, Shaun Presland, Donovan Cook, Frank Shek and Nicky Reimer and restaurants such as Bennelong and China Doll in Sydney, The Atlantic in Melbourne, Zuma in London and Nobu in Milan. In 2020, Clean Seas entered a partnership with Norwegian company Hofseth with the objective of selling frozen kingfish into the US market. As of April 2020, Clean Seas has not resumed kingfish farming in Fitzgerald Bay in South Australia.

She was a favorite milliner of Queen Marie Antoinette. She was the niece of Mme Pompey, and succeeded her in the privilege of selling the trimmings and accessories to the women of the royal court. She provided dresses for the ladies-in-waiting in the court of Versailles, and Queen Marie Antoinette was a regular costumer. Eloffe was described as a successful rival to Rose Bertin. She was known to advertise her business to the queen by having a portrait of her in the window of her shop. Her accounts books testify that it was common for noblewomen to order remakes of dresses rather than to order completely new ones, but that the remakes were often more expensive than new ones. The queen often ordered remakes and redecorations of old dresses from her. In 1785, the queen owed Eloffe a sum of 25.000 livres, in comparrisson to the 90.000 livres she owed Rose Bertin. After the outbreak of the French revolution, Eloffe no longer send her bills monthly to her clients, but charged them directly for each item. Madame Eloffe was one of the four top fashion merchants alongside Rose Bertin, Le Sieur Beaulard and Mademoiselle Alexandre during the reign of Louis XVI. Her account books, unlike those of Rose Bertin, have been preserved and are considered to be valuable historical sources, particularly in regard to the wardrobe of Maria Antoinette. Her business with Marie Antoinette was published in the work by Gustave-Armand- Henry, Comte de Reiset, Modes et usages au temps de Marie Antoinette: Livre- journal de Madame Eloffe, 2. vols.

law professor, attorney, and politician serving as the U.S. Representative for California's 45th congressional district since 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, she is the first Democrat to be elected to represent the district, which covers much of south-central Orange County, including Irvine, Tustin and Lake Forest along with large slices of Anaheim and Laguna Niguel. Porter attended Yale University for college and Harvard University for law school; she most recently taught at the University of California, Irvine School of Law.  Early life and education  Porter was born on January 3, 1974, and grew up in a small farming community in Iowa. Her father was a farmer-turned-banker. Her mother Liz was a founder of Fons & Porter's Love of Quilting. After graduating from Phillips Academy, Porter attended Yale University, where she majored in American studies, graduating in 1996. Her undergraduate thesis was titled The Effects of Corporate Farming on Rural Community. She was a member of Grace Hopper College (formerly Calhoun College) at Yale. Porter later attended Harvard Law School, where she was the Notes editor for the Harvard Women‚Äôs Law Journal. She studied under current U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, and graduated magna cum laude with her Juris Doctor in 2001.  Career  Porter clerked for Judge Richard S. Arnold of the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit in Little Rock. She practiced with the law firm of Stoel Rives LLP in Portland and was the Project Director for the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges' Business Bankruptcy Project.\\"The Business Bankruptcy Project is a five-year empirical study of about 3,200 business cases originally filed in Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 in 23 judicial districts during 1994.\\" https://ssrn.com/abstract=194750 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.194750 Elizabeth Warren & Jay Lawrence Westbrook, Financial Characteristics of Businesses in Bankruptcy, 73 AM.

In 2005, she joined the faculty of the University of Iowa College of Law as an associate law professor, becoming a full professor there in 2011 before joining the faculty as a tenured professor at the University of California, Irvine School of Law in 2011. Porter's textbook Modern Consumer Law addresses consumer laws in light of Dodd-Frank and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In March 2012, California Attorney General Kamala Harris appointed Porter to be the state's independent monitor of banks in a nationwide $25 billion mortgage settlement. As monitor, she oversaw the banks' implementation of $9.5 billion in settlement reforms for Californians.  U.S. House of Representatives  H.Res.4663 ‚Äî 116th Congress (2019-2020) Freedom from Price Gouging Act, sponsored by Porter In the 2018 elections, Porter ran for the United States House of Representatives against two-term incumbent Republican Mimi Walters in . She defeated Walters to become the first Democrat to represent the 45th district or its predecessors since it was created in 1953. The district was the 28th from 1953 to 1963, the 35th from 1963 to 1973, the 39th from 1973 to 1975, the 40th from 1975 to 1993, the 47th from 1993 to 2003, the 48th from 2003 to 2013, and has been the 45th since 2013. Porter's victory was part of a Democratic sweep of Orange County, long reckoned a bastion of suburban conservatism. For the first time since 1936, the Democrats took all four previously held Republican seats (including Porter's) in Orange County. They now hold all seven seats in the county. Porter did not accept corporate PAC money in her bid for Congress. She was endorsed by End Citizens United, a political action committee seeking to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court 2010 decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Porter has cited an overhaul of campaign finance laws and protection of voting rights as legislative priorities. =Help America Run Act= In March 2019, Porter introduced the \\"Help America Run Act\\" (H.R.1623), a bill that would allow people running for the House or Senate to use campaign contributions to pay for healthcare premiums, elder care, child care and dependent care. The bill passed the House in October 2019 and moved on to the Senate for a final vote. =Congressional questioning = Porter has earned a reputation for tough and pointed questioning of officials during congressional hearings, often using visual aids. She has attracted attention for her questioning on the House Financial Services Committee. In March 2019, her questioning caught Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan contradicting what his corporate lawyers were arguing in court, in that statements he had previously made pledging transparency were \\"corporate puffery\\", according to documents lawyers submitted. In April 2019, Porter drew attention for her questioning of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon about how a Chase bank teller should make up a $567 shortfall between her monthly budget and her paycheck. In May 2019, she asked Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson about \\"REOs\\", real-estate owned properties, which he confused with Oreo cookies. She also asked Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Kathy Kraninger to solve some math problems about annual percentage rates on payday loans, which Kraninger declined to do. In March 2020, Porter used five minutes of questioning to get the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert R. Redfield, to agree to use its legal authority to make testing for the COVID-19 virus free for all Americans. = Committee assignments = * Committee on Financial Services  Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions  Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets * Committee on Oversight and Reform = Caucus memberships = * Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus * Congressional Progressive Caucus  Electoral history   Personal life  Porter married Matthew Hoffman in 2003, with whom she has three children. During her campaign, she said her marriage was marked by physical and mental abuse. According to Porter, her husband punched her, shoved her one-year-old daughter across the kitchen, threatened to kill himself, and hurled profane insults at her family. The couple divorced in 2013, and Porter is now a single mother with custody of their children.

He is a member of the Republican Party. Crenshaw was commissioned in the United States Navy, and served on SEAL Team 3 in the War in Afghanistan, reaching the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He was wounded in action during his third deployment, losing his right eye to an improvised explosive device. He served as a legislative assistant to Congressman Pete Sessions, and was elected to Congress in the 2018 midterm election to succeed the retiring Ted Poe. Early life and education Born to American parents in Aberdeen, Scotland, Crenshaw grew up in Katy, Texas. His mother died of cancer when he was ten years old. His father, Jim Crenshaw, is a petroleum engineer who worked abroad, and Crenshaw spent time growing up in Ecuador and Colombia, gaining proficiency in Spanish. He graduated from Colegio Nueva Granada high school in Bogot√° in 2002. After high school, Crenshaw returned to the United States and attended Tufts University, graduating in 2006 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in international relations. Later, after his decade of military service, Crenshaw went to Harvard University and studied public administration at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, receiving a Master of Public Administration in 2017. He worked as a military legislative assistant for Congressman Pete Sessions. Military service While at Tufts, Crenshaw joined the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps and received an officer's commission in the U.S. Navy after graduation. Crenshaw received orders to Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S) at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. After six months of training, Crenshaw graduated with BUD/S class 264. Crenshaw completed SEAL qualification training in June 2008 and received the 1130 designator as a Naval Special Warfare Officer, entitled to wear the Special Warfare Insignia. He served in the Navy SEALs for ten years, including five tours of duty, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. His first deployment was to Fallujah, Iraq, where he joined SEAL Team Three. He was based out of Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in Coronado, California. As a Navy SEAL, Crenshaw was awarded two Bronze Star Medals, the Purple Heart, and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with valor. He medically retired from military service in 2016 with the rank of lieutenant commander. Crenshaw lost his right eye in 2012 during his third deployment when he was hit by an IED explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand Province. The blast destroyed his right eye, and he required surgery to save the vision in his left eye. He remained in the Navy for four years after the injury, and served his fourth and fifth tours of duty in Bahrain and South Korea.  United States House of Representatives  = 2018 election =  Primary election  In the 2018 elections, Crenshaw ran for the United States House of Representatives in to succeed the retiring Ted Poe. He announced his candidacy for Congress in November 2017. Crenshaw credited national security analyst John Noonan for encouraging him to run for Congress. During an interview in February 2018, he stated that border security and immigration reform would be two of his election issues. Crenshaw and Kevin Roberts advanced from the nine-candidate first-round of the Republican Party primary election to face each other in a second-round runoff election; Crenshaw received 155 votes more than Kathaleen Wall, a candidate who was backed by Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Greg Abbott. The lead-up to the runoff election was contentious. A super PAC, funded by Roberts' brother-in-law, Mark Lanier, focused on Crenshaw's 2015 statements that were critical of then- presidential candidate Donald Trump, despite Roberts having also been critical of President Trump in the past. The ads also compared Crenshaw's policy proposals to the likes of President Barack Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gaining the endorsement of Senator Tom Cotton, Crenshaw received national attention, appearing in print and television, including on Laura Ingraham's show on Fox Business.  General election  Crenshaw won the runoff to advance to the November general election. In August, it was reported that Crenshaw and four other candidates for Congress were current or former administrators of a conservative Facebook group called \\"Tea Party\\" that advanced debunked conspiracy theories. Crenshaw responded that he was unaware of the group's content and that he had been made an administrator without his consent. Crenshaw responded that he had shared the same campaign content to many other local and national groups without investigating their backgrounds. On November 6, Crenshaw was elected, defeating Democrat Todd Litton by a seven percent margin, 52.8% to 45.6%. Following the election, Crenshaw called for the de-politicization of comedy and sports and expressed a desire for political rhetoric to be toned down. On the November 3 episode of Saturday Night Live, comedian Pete Davidson joked about the appearances of multiple candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, and described Crenshaw as looking like a \\"hit man in a porno movie\\" while adding that he lost his eye in \\"war or whatever\\". The joke received significant criticism, and on the following episode, Davidson and Crenshaw appeared on air together. Davidson offered an apology, which Crenshaw accepted. Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke may have helped him win. =Tenure= Crenshaw spoke to the 2020 RNC Convention on August 26, 2020. =Committee assignments= * Committee on the Budget * Committee on Homeland Security  Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery  Subcommittee on Oversight, Management and Accountability (Ranking Member)  Political positions  = Abortion = Crenshaw opposes abortion. In 2019, Crenshaw received a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee. He has stated \\"life starts at conception\\" and that he believes Roe v. Wade was a \\"bad precedent to set\\" and abortion rights \\"should be decided by the states\\". = Coronavirus pandemic = During the coronavirus pandemic, Crenshaw said that Democrats and the media exaggerated the impact of the coronavirus. He was a high-profile defender of President Donald Trump's response to the pandemic. He did not wear face masks consistently in settings advised by health experts and mandated by Texas Governor Greg Abbott's order. = Healthcare = Crenshaw favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), describing it as an \\"unmitigated disaster\\". During his 2018 campaign, Crenshaw ran on a policy of allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, becoming one of a handful of Republicans to endorse what was primarily a progressive idea. By 2019, Crenshaw had retreated from this position. On May 24, 2019, Crenshaw co- sponsored a bill to extend time limits for claims under the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act.Wulfsohn, Joseph. Dan Crenshaw fact-checks NYT writer who wrongly accused him of not supporting 9/11 victims fund, FOX News, June 11, 2019.Congress.gov Cosponsors: H.R.1327 Never the Heroes: Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act ‚Äì 116th Congress (2019‚Äì2020), May 24, 2019. = Donald Trump = Crenshaw with President Donald Trump in December 2019 Crenshaw has been described as a \\"staunch defender\\" of President Trump. He voted against both articles of impeachment brought by the House of Representatives against President Trump in December 2019. In 2020, Crenshaw defended the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic. In a video retweeted by Trump, Crenshaw rebutted criticisms that the Trump administration had been slow in responding to the coronavirus. Crenshaw spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention, calling the United States \\"a country of heroes.\\"USA Today on MSN - \\"Who is Dan Crenshaw? Freshman Congressman who spoke at RNC is considered a rising star\\"NBC News - \\"Rep.

Dan Crenshaw was one of the few RNC speakers who didn't mention Trump\\"Axios - \\"Rep. Dan Crenshaw does not address Trump by name during RNC speech\\" = Election reform = In 2019, Crenshaw voiced opposition to the For the People Act of 2019. Crenshaw said the bill would \\"limit free speech drastically\\". Crenshaw also stated that the bill would use taxpayer money to \\"legalize\\" the kind of electoral fraud that he alleges occurred in the 2018 North Carolina's 9th congressional district election. PolitiFact rated Crenshaw's assertion concerning the North Carolina race \\"false\\", adding, \\"nothing in the bill that expands who can collect absentee ballots, allows people to fill out ballots for others, or loosens witnessing procedures for absentee ballots,\\" which relate to the controversial election in North Carolina. = Environmental issues = During his 2018 election campaign, Crenshaw's website made brief mention of global warming, applauding President Trump for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords. Crenshaw described the agreement as \\"costly and meaningless\\". He went on to call the agreement virtue signaling and said it was not good policy. He also stated that, \\"We must use our money to develop better infrastructure.\\" In 2018, Crenshaw called for a debate on the causes of climate change, adding, \\"We can't start off the conversation saying the climate is settled. The right way to have this conversation is to actually listen to what the science says on both sides.\\" In 2019, Crenshaw said, \\"climate change is occurring and that man-made emissions play a part in that. What isn't clear is how our actions will serve to reverse that warming trend, and what the cost-benefit outcome would be. Regardless, we should continue pursuing new green energy solutions that lessen our impact on the environment and create cleaner air and water.\\" In 2020 he criticized solar and wind power as \\"silly solutions\\" that \\"don't work,\\" and, instead, advocated expanding nuclear energy and carbon capture technology.https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Rep-Dan- Crenshaw-calls-wind-and-solar-energy-15613815.php = Immigration = In 2016, Crenshaw harshly criticized then-candidate Donald Trump's \\"insane rhetoric\\" toward Muslims and \\"hateful\\" speech. During Crenshaw's 2018 election campaign, he defended Trump's proposal to build a border wall on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. In a May 2019 appearance on The View, Crenshaw claimed that 80‚Äì90% of asylum seeker requests \\"don't have a valid asylum claim\\". PolitiFact rated his statement as \\"false\\", asserting that while it is true that between 20 to 30 percent of asylum requests per annum have been granted since 2009, some of the rejected applications may still hold legal merit. = Social issues = Crenshaw believes that government should not be involved in regulating marriage and has expressed support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2015, he took issue with people trying to suggest Christianity is as shocking and as violent as Islam, saying that ‚Äúthe worst thing modern Christianity stands for is anti-homosexual marriage, which is a far cry from sex slaves, sharia law and beheadings.‚ÄùCrenshaw wants to lead conservative youth, if the GOP old guard will let him. McClatchy DC Bureau. May 15, 2018. In the case of a then-7-year-old who at the age of 3 began to identify as a girl after being assigned male at birth, and who was the subject of a custodial battle between her father and mother in which the former was against and the latter in favor of her identification, Crenshaw opined in favor of the father. Following a decision by the judge to grant custody to the mother over the father, Crenshaw called it \\"heartbreaking\\" and added, \\"[a] 7-year-old can't possibly make this decision or understand it. Parents should know better. I hope this father receives the public support he needs.\\" Crenshaw opposes a ban on semi-automatic firearms.

Studios. The game features characters and settings from more than 50 different indie games, such as Shovel Knight, VVVVVV, Teslagrad, the Bit.Trip series, and Freedom Planet. After being successfully funded via Kickstarter in October 2017, the game was released on Microsoft Windows in July 2018.  Gameplay  In Indie Pogo, up to four players battle across one of several open arenas with platforms, and attempt to defeat opponents by depleting their health or knocking them off the screen, similar to the Super Smash Bros. series. Unlike other fighting games, the primary gameplay mechanic of Indie Pogo is auto-jumping: characters landing on the ground or a platform will automatically jump back into the air. Every character has access to a set of aerial melee attacks and special moves derived from those used in their original game, such as Shovel Knight wielding his Relics, or Captain Viridian inverting their own gravity. Characters can also perform a double-jump, a directional air-dodge, a mid-air grab, parkour movement on the ground and walls, and a charge-based attack that keeps them on the ground until the button is released. During a battle, players can initiate a \\"pogo combo\\" by repeatedly bouncing off opponents' heads without taking damage, ending when the character touches the ground. The player will gain gems by performing a successful pogo combo, and can use five of their gems to activate a character- specific super move. An update in May 2019 added \\"Augments\\", gameplay modifiers that can be equipped to a character before a battle. The \\"Heavy Metal\\" augment, for example, disables the auto-jump mechanic and allows the player to move freely on the ground. The game includes a basic arcade mode that pits players against a series of opponents, culminating in a battle against the game's final boss, Crow from Starblade's Nefarious. Players can also participate in Challenge Mode, which tasks them with completing specific scenarios similar to the Event Matches in Super Smash Bros., and Infinite Pogo, in which they must defeat as many opponents as possible before their character's health is depleted. The game supports local four-player battles, as well as online matchmaking. Players will earn coins after each battle, which can be used at an in-game shop to purchase new characters, stages, character skins, and taunts; additional skins are available as premium downloadable content. Coins can also be spent at a gashapon machine for a chance to win collectible in-game trophies based on other indie titles.  Characters  The game featured 14 playable characters at launch. As of February 2020, four additional characters have been added via free updates, with four other characters planned for inclusion for a total of 22. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fighter ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 5em;\\" Playable ! scope=\\"col\\"  Game ! scope=\\"col\\"  Creator - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Blockman  The Blocks Cometh  Halfbot - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Bullet Kin  data-sort-value=\\"Y (DLC)\\"  Enter the Gungeon  Dodge Roll - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Captain Viridian  VVVVVV  Terry Cavanagh - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" CommanderVideo  Bit.Trip  Choice Provisions - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Diogenes  data-sort- value=\\"Y (DLC)\\"  Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy  Bennett Foddy - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Dust  data-sort-value=\\"Y (DLC)\\"  Dust: An Elysian Tail  Humble Hearts - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Fishy  Sh√ºtshimi  Neon Deity Games - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Gunvolt  data-sort-value=\\"Y (DLC)\\"  Azure Striker Gunvolt  Inti Creates - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Jack  Jack the Reaper  Dream's Bell - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Kick  data-sort-value=\\"Y (DLC)\\"  Divekick  Iron Galaxy - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Octodad  data-sort-value=\\"Y (DLC)\\"  Octodad: Dadliest Catch  Young Horses - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Orcane  Rivals of Aether  Dan Fornace - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Penelope  The Next Penelope  Aur√©lien Regard - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Sash Lilac  Freedom Planet  GalaxyTrail - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Shovel Knight  Shovel Knight  Yacht Club Games - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Stardrop  Stardrop  Lowe Bros.

According to game director Trevor Lowe, the auto-jumping mechanic \\"keeps gameplay always in motion\\". The game was self- funded by Lowe Bros. Studios for three years before launching a Kickstarter campaign on September 12, 2017 with a $25,000 funding goal. By the end of the campaign, the game had raised nearly $42,000.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1642689247/indie-pogo  Reception  Indie Pogo was positively received by critics. PushDustIn of Source Gaming praised it for being easy to get into and said that the game was \\"everything [he] wanted out of an Indie crossover fighting game\\". Ryan Silberman of The Inner Circle Games Network stated that Indie Pogo was a love letter to the Indie industry, and that the developers \\"went for a quality- over-quantity approach\\".

Langer 1913-2000 was a nuclear physicist and a group leader of the Manhattan Project which developed the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He oversaw the final assembly of the first atomic bomb on the Pacific Island of Tinian and slept on the bomb itself the night before it was dropped. He also developed sonar and radar detectors during World War II and worked on the \\"gun\\" mechanism used to detonate the Uranium-235 bombs used on Japan.  Early life  Langer was born in New York City on December 22, 1913. He received his B.S. in 1934, M.S. in 1935, and his Ph.D. in physics in 1938 all from New York University. The year that he received his PhD, the President of Indiana University, Herman B Wells, had a vision to start a modern-day research program in the physics department. Wells recruited Alan Mitchell who in turn hired Langer to join the IU faculty.  World War II  As the war approached, Langer was recruited to work in the MIT Radiation Laboratory where he was involved in flight-testing of radar prototypes in fighter planes. He was then called by the Navy to San Diego, where he worked on the development and testing of sonar detectors. In 1943, he was invited to Los Alamos, where he worked on developing the gun mechanism used to set off the atomic bombs. The final assembly of the atomic bombs occurred on the Tinian Islands.Tinian is a South Pacific Island. In 1945 it was the home to the world's largest airfield-six runways each 2 miles long and as wide as a 10 lane highway. The USS Indianapolis delivered the parts for the 9,700 pound Uranium-235 atomic bomb to the Tinian Islands in 1945 only to be sunk by the Japanese on its return voyage. Langer was chosen to help assemble the bomb because of his experience with its development. Since he was not a naval officer, Langer had to train Navy Captain William S. \\"Deak\\" Parsons to arm the bomb once it was airborne using a wrench. This was a safety precaution since airplanes were known to crash upon take off from the Islands. The first atomic bomb was nicknamed \\"Little Boy\\". The night before it was dropped it was hooked into the bomb bay of the B-29 Superfortress named the \\"Enola Gay\\". The plane and its explosive cargo were guarded by the Military Police. Dr. Langer was not confident about the ability of the MPs to protect Little Boy from curious onlookers. According to an AP interview he gave in 1995 on the 50th anniversary of detonation of the bomb, he recalled \\"My experience with the MPs is that they weren't very reliable so I decided to stay with the bomb and forgo dinner, \\" Langer said. As twilight faded into darkness, Longer grew tired. \\"The only place to stretch out was on top of the bomb so I did and fell asleep,\\" he said. Langer was awaken from his nights rest on Little Boy by the sounds of the photographer's flash bulbs popping while they were documenting the Enola Gay before its historic flight. At 2:45 am on August 6, 1945, Colonel Paul Tibbets and his crew lifted off. They dropped Little Boy about 5 hours later on Hiroshima and marked the beginning of nuclear warfare on planet earth.https://nwtimes.com/uncategorized/iu-scientist-remembers-napping-upon- bomb/article  Indiana University  Dr. Langer returned to Indiana University in 1946 after the end of World War II. He began to develop one of the world's major laboratories for nuclear spectroscopy and beta-ray spectral shapes becoming a leader in source and detector techniques. His other interests included neutrino-antineutrino identity, a search for neutrino degeneracy and also for neutrino mass. He and his colleague in theoretical physics, Emil Konopinski, produced a 1953 article in \\"Annual Review\\" on beta decay that was widely cited. He supervised 27 students through their PhD work. He became Chairman of the IU Physics Department in 1965 and helped oversee the IU Cyclotron facility and Nuclear Theory Center in conjunction with the National Science Foundation. Langer stepped down as chair in 1973 and returned to full-time research and teaching. He was forced to retire in 1979 after losing his battle with multiple sclerosis. He died in Bloomington on January 17, 2000.

Mademoiselle Alexandre came from a family of dressmakers. In 1740, she opened a fashion shop at the Rue de la Monnaie in Paris.

During the last years of Louis XV, Alexandre was described as the top fashion merchant in Paris alongside Le sieur Beaulard, and S√©bastien Mercier in Tableau de Paris described her and Beulard and the two rulers of fashion. Her fame gave her international clients, and she was able to import and export her fashion products. She had clients within the ladies-in-waitings of the royal court, and was given the assignment of providing the French wardrobes of the princesses Marie Jos√©phine of Savoy and Maria Theresa of Savoy when they married into the royal house in 1771 and 1773.

It has been described as his most popular poem. Duncan, who was a keen horseman, and his wife Rose Marie, bred Arabian horses on their Devonshire property. The poem is still read each year at the end of the gala evening on the Sunday night. It has been read at the event by different actors over the years including Simon MacCorkingdale and Brian Blessed.  Legacy  The poem has inspired various people such as Lucinda Green, British world champion eventer and Olympic medal winner, who when writing in Country Life describes the bond that is formed between man and horse as being founded on Duncan's observations expressed in the poem. The English journalist and horseman Alistair Stewart who, when writing in the Daily Mail about the death of a family pony said, \\"Ronald Duncan‚Äôs poem, The Horse, captures it perfectly: ‚ÄòNobility without pride, friendship without envy, beauty without vanity.‚Äô\\" The poem has been reproduced in a number of specialist equine publications.

Early life and career  Helena Gworek was born in 1908 in Krak√≥w, Poland. She studied agriculture at the Jagiellonian University where Dr. Bronis≈Çaw Marceli ≈öli≈ºy≈Ñski was a lecturer in genetics. The head of the Department at that time was Professor Teodor Marchlewski, who had previously worked as a researcher at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh. Helen graduated with a thesis on selection in Drosophila. In 1936 she married Slizynski and the couple received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation which enabled them to go to Cold Spring Harbor for a year. Slyzinska worked together with Milislav Demerec, using the new method for locating genes from overlapping deficiencies in the salivary gland chromosomes.  Career in Edinburgh  In August 1939, the Slizynskis came to Edinburgh to attend the Seventh International Congress of Genetics, which was being hosted by the Institute of Animal Genetics under Francis Albert Eley Crew. However, the outbreak of war during the Congress prevented the couple from returning to Poland and they remained permanently in Edinburgh. During the war Helen worked as senior assistant in the Department of Biology and Genetics at the Polish School of Medicine in Edinburgh. When the war ended she joined the Institute of Animal Genetics as a researcher. Hermann J. Muller, who was also staying at the Institute at the time, enrolled their cytological expertise in problems that occupied him, especially the behaviour of the ring chromosome at replication. First in collaboration with her husband, then by herself, Helen analyzed the salivary glands of the progeny of irradiated and chemically treated males, developing a technique that made the results as reliable as humanly possible. Slizynska's most notable contribution was her analysis of the difference between the spectra of chromosomal changes produced by X-rays on the one hand and chemicals on the other.  Personal life and death  The couple kept in contact with the many other Poles who came to Scotland during the war. Up to her death Slizynska was involved in the social life of the Polish community. Helen retired early to coincide with her husband's retirement, although she found it difficult to give up her scientific research. The couple had acquired a cottage in the Trossachs and it was here that Slizynska died from a heart attack after having survived several severe attacks in hospital.

It was completed by John Millington Synge in 1901 and first published in 1907. It is based on Synge's multiple travels through the Irish speaking and predominately rural set of islands off the Western coast of Ireland. The book presents many of the local specificities of the Aran Island people while simultaneously contextualizing the Aran Islands as part of broader European and global commercial networks.  Summary  The Aran Islands is a four part collection of Synge's account of his interactions with the people, culture, and language of the Aran Islands. Synge first arrives on Inishmore via a steamer from Galway. Notably, regular steamer service between mainland Ireland and the Aran Islands only began in 1891, and then only to Inishmore, since it is the largest of the three. From there Synge travels to Inishmaan, the middle island, and continues his interactions with the local community. On Inishmaan Synge continues to develop his Gaelic and notes that he feels as if he is traveling farther from civilization (a concept that pleases him). However, he also notes the connections between the community (and their stories) and mainland Ireland, Europe, and America. Synge then travels to the smallest island, Inishneer, before returning to Inismaan. After this Synge records his irregular travels between the islands and other parts of Europe.  Importance  Due to the rocky topography and limited natural resources and shipping capabilities of the Aran Islands they remain largely isolated from mainland Ireland. As such, communities on the Aran Islands developed in specific ways that are reflected in the culture and language of the Aran Islands. Some of these specific traditions have since disappeared or otherwise been changed by the modernization and tourist commodification of the islands but Synge's work has preserved some parts of this way of life.

Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities poem written in Old French. It is widely, although not universally, attributed to Raoul de Houdenc. It consists of 6182Friedwagner, 1909. The Hippeau edition, based on a single manuscript, has 6176 lines octosyllabic verses. The title comes from line 6173 of the Chantilly manuscript.Hippeau, 1862, page 214. The Chantilly manuscript is the only one that has the end of the poem (see under manuscripts above)  Plot  King Arthur, looking out of the window of his court at Caerleon, sees a boat with a dead knight on it. The body has a lance thrust through it, and has five rings in its hand. Gawain is the only one able to remove the lance, but is unable to remove the rings. While no-one is looking, another knight comes and takes the five rings. Kay, alerted by a valet, pursues him. Kay, however, is defeated by a mysterious knight, and Gawain is sent instead. Despite warnings from a local cowherd, Gawain enters the castle of the Black Knight, where he is attacked. He defeats the Black Knight, who begs for his life, and Gawain spares him on the condition he becomes his vassal. While riding, they come across a hunting party from the court of Gautdestroit. They allow the hunting party to hunt and kill a white stag, and Gawain accompanies them to meet her. Alerted by a servant girl (called Marot), Gawain introduces himself to the court as Kay. Gautdestroit reveals that she plans to capture and kill Gawain, who spurned her after winning a tournament. Furthermore, she has his brother, Gahariet, in prison. Gawain escapes with Gahariet, returning to the nearby castle of the Black Knight, where they are besieged by Gautdestroit. Overwhelmed, Gawain and Gahariet leave to go and get help. They go to the court of King Arthur. Gawain finds the boat the knight traveled on and enters. It takes him to Scotland where he meets a woman dressed with all her clothes inside out or back-to-front. She says she's promised to wear her clothes like this until she meets Gawain, the knight destined to avenge her husband, Raguidel. She reveals her husband's killer is called Guingasouin, and his weapons are enchanted, so that only the broken lance from her husband's body (which Gawain has kept) can kill him. Gawain finds and attacks Guingasouin, who is impervious to his weapons. Gawain uses the broken lance to pierce his hauberk, and he flees. Guingasouin demands a fresh battle with fresh weapons in front of his barons. Gawain defeats Guingasouin, and when he refuses to ask for mercy, Gawain kills him. The Hippeau 1862 edition has a plot summary (in French) in the introduction (pages III to XHippeau, 1862) and Gaston Paris gives a plot summary (also in French) in his 1888 essay Romans en vers du cycle de la Table ronde (pages 49‚Äì50).

Tadatoshi Naito's mother was Naito Sadafusa who was from the Naito clan. The Naito clan are descended from Fujiwara no Hidesato (Hokke (Fujiwara)). Tadatoshi Naito would serve as lord of Yagi castle. Hisahide's granddaughter, Matsunaga Teitoku (ÊùæÊ∞∏Ë≤ûÂæ≥) also strengthened the Matsunaga clan's link to the Fujiwara clan. Her mother was the older sister of Fujiwara Seika (Ëó§ÂéüÊÉ∫Á™©). Teitoku's cousin was Tadatoshi Naito.https://wiki.samurai- archives.com/index.php?title=Naito_Julia Other sources suggest that the Matsunaga clan may have descended from the Minamoto clan and may be the descendants of Takenouchi no Sukune. Mikawa Matsunaga clan It was a powerful clan in the Mikawa Province. Matsunaga Heiza'emon (ÊùæÂπ≥Âπ≥Â∑¶Ë°õÈñÄ) served Matsudaira Kiyoyasu (ÊùæÂπ≥Ê∏ÖÂ∫∑), who was the 7th head of the Matsudaira clan and grandfather of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Heiza'emon's son, Genzo (Ê∫êËóè) served Ieyasu which can be seen in Kansei Choshu Shokafu (genealogies of vassals in Edo Bakufu). The Matsunagas in this clan used the tsuta mon (ivy) as their family crest. Descendants of this clan continued to serve the Tokugawa Bakufu. Other Japanese people, who used the Matsunaga name, originated from this area. Some emigrated to Hawaii, United States and Brazil in the late 1800s. Spark Matsunaga may be a descendant of this clan. Yamato Matsunaga clan Matsunaga Danjo Hisahide, one of the few portraits where he is not shown as an old shrewd man.The Matsunaga clan that follows the lineage of Matsunaga Danjo Hisahide (ÊùæÊ∞∏ÂºæÊ≠£‰πÖÁßÄ) is the most famous in Japan. Hisahida was the daimy≈ç of the Yamato Province during the Sengoku period. He was born in the year of 1508 and shares the same roots with the Fujiwara clan as the Matsunaga clan in the Mikawa Province. They both used the same tsuta-mon (ivy) as their family crest. In Japan, when people think of the Matsunaga clan, it is usually Hisahide they are referring to. Hisahide served as the main retainer for Miyoshi Nagayoshi of the Miyoshi clan in the Yamato Province. He also served as retainer briefly for the Oda clan. Hisahide‚Äôs actual title was Danjo Shohitsu (ÂºæÊ≠£Â∞ëÂºº) which was positioned under the vice minister of Danjo with the Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. He would become the daimy≈ç of the Yamato Province. Hisahide later committed seppuku after Oda Nobunaga besieged him at Shigisan Castle in 1577. Both of his sons, Kojiro and Hisamichi (ÊùæÊ∞∏‰πÖÈÄö), also committed seppuku during the siege. =Hizen and Higo Matsunaga Clans= Hisamichi, the heir of Hisahide, had a son named Hikobe‚Äôe Ichimaru or Kazumaru (ÂΩ¶ÂÖµË°õ‰∏Ä‰∏∏). He moved down to Hakata, Chikuzen Province, opened a pawnshop and became a wealthy merchant. Hikobe's descendant became retainers of the Saga Domain. They include Matsunaga Munetomo (ÊùæÊ∞∏ÂÆó‰º¥) as a retainer of the Saga Domain and Matsunaga Shouemon (ÊùæÊ∞∏ÊâÄÂè≥Ë°õÈñÄ) as a retainer of Kashima Domain which was a branched domain of the Saga Domain. There was also another Matsunaga clan that was started by Kuen (ÊùæÊ∞∏Á©∫Âúì), a Buddhist monk who claimed himself as a younger brother of Matsunaga Hisahide. Their family crest is the pattern based on Japanese ginger and similar patterns but not the ivy ones (tsuta-mon) which had given from the Ryuzoji clan (ÈæçÈÄ†ÂØ∫Ê∞è) which was one of the warlords that dominated the area. =Karatsu Matsunaga Clan= Matsunaga Toh (ÊùæÊ∞∏Êù±), who served as the Chairman of the 45th House of Representative and the 79th Minister of Education, had Matsunaga family roots in Karatsu, Saga, at the time part of the Saga Domain.

She qualified for the NFR seven times between 1995‚Äì1998 and 2013‚Äì2015. She made her first NFR debut when she was 13 years old in 1995. Her horse BabyFlo was named the Women's Professional Rodeo Association/American Quarter Horse Association WPRA/AQHA Barrel Racing Horse of the Year in 2013.  Early life  Fallon Taylor was born July 18, 1982 in Tampa, Florida. Taylor was the youngest of three children born to Shelton and Dian Taylor. Taylor was 7 years old the first time she watched rodeo, and she developed an intense desire to participate. Wanting to encourage and support Taylor, her parents moved the family to Texas where they better accommodate her. Having no equestrian background, they had her train with an industry legend, Martha Josey. Josey also trained Taylor's mare, Flowers and Money, who was the dam of Babyflo. She was homeschooled in order to focus on her riding.  Career  Taylor was 8 years old when she joined the Women's Professional Rodeo Association in 1990. She first qualified for the NFR at the young age of 13 in 1995. She also qualified for the next three years. Also in 1995, Taylor placed sixth in the World Standings and placed 12th in her last year as a qualifier. As a teenager, she qualified for four NFRs. At age 14, Taylor won RodeoHouston, the largest rodeo in the world, and banked a check for $15,000. For Taylor, being a teenager in the top rodeo in the country was a big deal. \\"It was awesome,\\" she said. \\"I had a different perspective than the adults who went there stressing out about different things. I was just excited to be in Vegas, to go Circus Circus and ride the big top, sign a few autographs and get on my horse.\\" The horses that got her to the NFR at that time were Dr. Nick Bar and Flowers and Money. = Seasons 1995-1998 = * 1995 ‚Äì Finished 6th in the World Standings with $62,414 * 1996 ‚Äì Finished 9th in the World Standings with $59,925 * 1997 ‚Äì Finished 7th in the World Standings with $56,556 * 1998 ‚Äì Finished 12th in the World Standings with $47,277 Source: However, after 1998, she lost interest in barrel racing. She was encouraged to take advantage of all the opportunities that came her way. She grew tired of life on the road and excited by the life of New York City. Then she decided she wanted to focus on acting and modeling. She modeled in New York City, acted in Los Angeles, California, and trained horses in Texas for others for about fifteen years. She acted in roles in High Hopes, The Loop, Four Kings and as Charlie Sheen's girlfriend on Two and A Half Men. She also worked as the Axe Body Spray girl. During this time that she trained horses, she did not return to competitive rodeo. In 2009, Taylor was loping a gelding one evening when the horse slipped. The horse started bucking. \\"It got Western,\\" she said. \\"He was snapping and kicking. He reared up and fractured my skull in four places. I picked a spot to land and tried to get off ‚Äì terrible idea. When I did, he kicked my feet and I went 12 feet in the air and landed straight on my head.\\" For three days, Taylor was paralyzed. She fractured her skull in four places, shattered bones on the right side of her face along with her eye socket, and fractured her C-2 vertebra. Doctors predicted only 2 percent chance that she would walk again. Taylor made it her only goal to recover from her injuries. She even wore a halo for three months. She recovered enough to walk again after 1 and 1/2 years. After that, she made her next goal to ride again. It took her a year of substandard riding before she found her pace again. In fact, she said that she rides better now than before the accident. \\"I ride ten times better now than the first finals in the 90s, I have a lot more awareness of my body and my horse.\\" After her recovery and with her husband's support, Taylor was determined to return to competitive rodeo at the age of 31. She choose the offspring of the horse who took her to the NFR four times in her teenage years, BabyFlo, who was a young mare. They started BabyFlo right away. BabyFlo placed in the top of her division at her first rodeo, albeit with many mistakes. However, even though Babyflo surprised Taylor with her potential, she immediately told her family this was the horse who would take her back to the top. = Season 2012 = Taylor finished 2012 ranked 16th in the World Standings with $53,922 in season earnings.

The specific name undulatum is Latin, meaning \\"wavy\\" or \\"undulated\\", referring, just as the common name, to the wavy leaf margins of the herb. The plant has a diploid number of 16 or 32. Description Hypericum undulatum grows tall, typically erect or decumbent with a creeping or rooting base. The herb typically has numerous to few narrow stems, each with four wings of tissue that bear black glands. The internodes are longer than the leaves, measuring long. The sessile leaves have elliptic to narrowly oblong blades measuring long and wide. The apex of the leaf is rounded, the margin is undulate, and the base is rounded or cordate. The leaves have pale undersides and are thinly or thickly chartaceous. The leaves have three, occasionally four, pairs of main lateral veins that arise from the lower quarter of the midrib, as well as a dense tertiary reticulation. Leaves have pale, dense laminar glands and black, close intramarginal glands that are irregular in size. The inflorescence of the herb is forty-flowered and arises from one to three nodes, with the ascending or horizontal flowering branches arising from up to six nodes. The lax inflorescence is predominantly cylindrical to subcorymbiform. The pedicels are long and the lanceolate, entire bracts and bracteoles are long. The star- shaped flowers are wide and are ellipsoid and obtuse while in bud. The five unequal sepals are long and wide and are erect in bud and fruit. The sepals each have five to seven veins and six to twenty black punctiform laminar glands. The five bright yellow petals of each flower are tinged with red dorsally and are long and wide, typically about twice the length of the sepals. The petals are obovate to oblanceolate and bear few punctiform laminar glands. Flowers have 25 to 40 stamens, the longest of which measure . The trilocular, ovoid ovaries are long and wide. The ovoid capsules are long and wide. The cylindrical, yellow-brown seeds are long. The plant flowers in August and September and seeds germinate in the spring. Taxonomy Hypericum undulatum occurs in two principal varieties: H. undulatum var. undulatum and H. undulatum var. boeticum. The majority of the species, H. undulatum var. undulatum, has narrow, undulated leaf margins and reddish flower buds, but a population in Sierra Nevada has flat leaf margins and untinged leaves. This population, named H. boeticum by Pierre Edmond Boissier, has intermediate characteristics between H. undulatum and H. tetrapterum. However, the broad leaves and inflorescence resembling H. tetrapterum in H. boeticum is interpreted as parallel development between the two species; the petals and leaves of the species represent a reversion rather than an intermediate condition. The species H. boeticum is now treated as a variety of H. undulatum rather than a separate species, but certain scattered populations of true hybrids do occur in the Iberian Peninsula. Distribution and habitat Hypericum undulatum grows in non-calcareous fields and marshes, stream banks, fens, and acidic bogs at elevations from sea level to . The plant prefers wet areas with lateral water movement. Hypericum undulatum occurs in far western Europe and northern Africa. In the United Kingdom the herb can be found in Cornwall, western Devon, Pembroke, Cardigan, and Merioneth, and in Ireland it can be found in western Cork. In continental Europe it occurs in Brittany, central and western Spain, and Portugal. In Africa it occurs in western Algeria, northern Morocco, Madeira, and Azores. The variety boeticum occurs only in extreme southern Spain with the variety undulatum occurring throughout the rest of the distribution. Ecology Hypericum undulatum typically grows in vegetation dominated by mixtures of Molinia caerula, Juncus acutiflorus, and Juncus effusus. It also occurs in conjunction with a variety of other herbs, typically including Angelica sylvestris, Cirsium palustre, Filipendula ulmaria, Galium palustre, Lotus pendunculatus, Mentha aquatica, and Senecio aquaticus. Population sizes of the herb can vary greatly, increasing especially following reinstatement of grazing or burning in overgrown sites. Decline of H. undulatum in localities is mostly due to habitat loss, typically resulting from agricultural intensification. Managing populations of the herb in grasslands involves grazing in the summer and occasional burning in the winter.

Accessibility is generally associated with a place (or places) of origin. A place with \\"high accessibility\\" is one from which many destinations can be reached, or destinations can be reached with relative ease. \\"Low accessibility\\" implies that relatively few destinations can be reached for a given amount of time/effort/cost or that reaching destinations is more difficult or costly from that place. The concept can also be defined in the other direction, and we can speak of a place having accessibility from some set of surrounding places. For example, one could measure the accessibility of a store to customers as well as the accessibility of a potential customer to some set of stores. In time geography, accessibility has also been defined as \\"person based\\" rather than \\"place based\\", were one would consider a person's access to some type of amenity through the course of their day as they move through space. For example, a person might live in a food desert but have easy access to a grocery store from their place of work. Accessibility is often calculated separately for different modes of transport.  Mathematical definition  In general, accessibility A is defined as: A_i = \\\\sum_j {W_j } \\\\times f\\\\left( {C_{ij} } \\\\right) where: * i = index of origin locations * j = index of destination locations * W_j = a set of weights associated with destinations e.g. the number of jobs in a traffic analysis zone * C_{ij} is a cost of travel from i to j and * f\\\\left( {C_{ij} } \\\\right) is an impedance function on the travel cost giving the utility of a destination. = Cost metrics = Travel cost metrics (C_{ij} in the equation above) can take a variety of forms such as: *Euclidean Distance * Network distance * Travel time * Monetary cost or fare * Comfort or subjective ease of travel *Internal and/or external costs Cost metrics may also be defined using any combination of these or other metrics. For a non-motorized mode of transport, such as walking or cycling, the generalized travel cost may include additional factors such as safety or gradient. The essential idea is to define a function that describes the ease of travelling from any origin i to any destination j. = Impedance functions = The function on the travel cost f\\\\left( {C_{ij} } \\\\right) determines how accessible a destination is based on the travel cost associated with reaching that destination. Two common impedance functions are \\"cumulative opportunities\\" and a negative exponential function. Cumulative opportunities is a binary function yielding 1 if an opportunity can be reached within some threshold and 0 otherwise. It is defined as: f(C_{ij}) = \\\\begin{cases} 1~~\\\\text{if} & C_{ij} \\\\leq \\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0~~\\\\text{if} & C_{ij} > \\\\theta \\\\end{cases} where \\\\theta is the threshold parameter. A negative exponential impedance function can be defined as: f(C_{ij}) = e^{ -\\\\beta C_{ij} } where \\\\beta is a parameter defining how quickly the function decays with distance.  Relation to land use  Accessibility has long been associated with land- use; as accessibility increases in a given place, the utility of developing the land increases. This association is often used in integrated transport and landuse forecasting models.  In practice  Transport for London utilize a calculated approach known as Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) that uses the distance from any point to the nearest public transport stops, and service frequency at those stops, to assess the accessibility of a site to public transport services. Destination-based accessibility measures are an alternate approach that can be more sophisticated to calculate. These measures consider not just access to public transport services (or any other form of travel), but the resulting access to opportunities that arises from it. For example, using origin-based accessibility (PTAL) we can understand how many buses one may be able to be access. Using destination-based measures we can calculate how many schools, hospitals, jobs, restaurants (etc..) can be accessed.

The extravagant book covers feature an inscription in which Theodelinda offers the book to the religious figure. Many scholars believe that the book covers, as well as the inscription were created in the early 7th century. The manuscript that the cover contained has been lost. Scholars regard the covers as an important example of Lombard metalwork, and they remain at Monza cathedral today. The book covers make part of a larger collection of objects gifted by the queen to the basilica she founded.  Decoration  The main material making up the book covers of Theodelinda is gold, which is engraved and inset with green, red and blue jewels within the central design of a large cross. The central design of the large cross divides each book cover into four quadrants which are each perfectly symmetrical. The two covers feature the same design and are almost completely identical to each other. The covers are decorated with Roman-style cameos. Two of these cameos, which were replaced in 1773 feature the image of Christ and the Virgin Mary. On each cover, there are four cameos, perhaps representing the four evangelists.  Original Contents  The decoration featured on the book covers of Theodelinda suggests that the covers most likely housed a Gospel Codex. The style of the covers of Theodelinda features similarities to other book covers from the period that contained the same kind of manuscript.  Legacy  The book covers remain an intricate example of early medieval religious book covers and are regarded by scholars as an important resource in examining early medieval ornamentations of Gospel Codices. The book covers also serve as an important example of Lombard metalwork. Additionally, the inscription on the book covers make the work the first recorded instance of Theodelinda's involvement with the Monza Cathedral, which was perhaps her greatest achievement.

It is a short, summer-flowering bulbous plant, with a dense spike (raceme) of yellowish-green flowers topped by a \\"head\\" of leafy bracts. In Afrikaans it is called ('rock lily'). Description Eucomis amaryllidifolia is a short summer-growing bulbous plant, tall. Its bulb is more or less spherical, across, with a dark brown outer tunic. Five or six leaves emerge from the bulb, long and across. The margins of the leaves are wavy. The inflorescence is a densely packed raceme with 30‚Äì50 individual flowers. The raceme is topped by a head or \\"coma\\" formed from 13 to 20 bracts about long. The somewhat sweetly scented flowers have six yellowish green tepals, long by wide. The ovary is greenish yellow. The seeds are glossy and black. It flowers in summer and early autumn (January to March in its native South Africa). Taxonomy Eucomis amaryllidifolia was first described by John Gilbert Baker in 1878. He referred to the leaves as \\"Amaryllis-like\\" in contrast with the broader leaves of E. undulata (now a synonym of E. autumnalis), which it otherwise resembled. In 1972, William Frederick Reyneke considered the species to be merely a variety of E. autumnalis, but then, in 1980, elevated it to a subspecies, as E. autumnalis subsp. amaryllidifolia. However, later research showed that E. amaryllidifolia was one of the smaller diploid species of Eucomis, with 2n = 2x = 30, whereas E. autumnalis was one of the larger tetraploid species, with 2n = 4x = 60. Accordingly, E. amaryllidifolia is now accepted as a full species. Distribution and habitat Eucomis amaryllidifolia is native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa, and in particular the Eastern Cape, possibly extending into the Orange Free State. It grows on rocky slopes and ridges, in full sun. Cultivation Eucomis amaryllidifolia was not in general cultivation . In the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, it is grown in pots in an open, slightly acid medium. The pots are placed in a sunny position and watered well in summer, but kept completely dry in winter. A high potash fertilizer is used. The bulbs are considered to be hardy down to . Propagation is by seed, bulb slicing, leaf cuttings and tissue culture. Mealybugs can be a significant pest.

During the Great Depression, she was Director of the Federal Art Gallery in New York City, which supported artists under the auspices of the Work Projects Administration. She also operated her own private Onya LaTour Gallery in New York. In 1939, she brought her collection of more than 400 works of art from New York City to the artists colony in rural Brown County, Indiana, where she founded a short-lived Indiana Museum of Modern Art (see #Homes). From 1948 to the 1960s, she designed and built three unusual and creative homes where she displayed her collection, often inviting diverse groups of people to mingle and experience modern art. In 1972, a few years before her death at age 80, she donated over 100 paintings and graphic art works as well as her lifetime collection of papers to the Indianapolis Museum of Art, where an exhibit of selections from her collection took place October‚ÄìApril, 2014.

Carrie had three children all of whom died very young, which left her devastated. Carrie died at age 20, possibly of suicide. (1878-1962) of Washington, Indiana. Ona had a difficult childhood. Her father was a heavy drinker and abusive. Ona left home at age 14. Her mother had separated from her father sometime earlier. She lived for a time with her father in Montana,According to La Tour's daughter Manya La Tour Cheren in 2014, Simon Tarr was killed in a drunken gunfight in Montana in 1915. The shooter was not identified on his death certificate. and then with her step-mother and half brother (see Alva La Toor below) in Oklahoma. Simon Tarr sometimes may have used the names Toor or LaToor. It is not known when Ona adopted the name Onya La Tour (also sometimes given as Onya LaTour). In a 1940 newspaper article, her first name was consistently Ona and her last name La Tour or LaTour. La Tour attended Graceland College in Lamona, Iowa, where she met Albro Latimer Kellock, whom she married in 1920. In 1921, they homesteaded 160 acres near Spokane, Washington. La Tour's daughter Manya was born on the homestead ca. 1926. After five years there, a forest fire destroyed their home, and they moved to Seattle, Washington. There, La Tour developed a circle of artist friends and began to collect art. Her home became a gathering place for \\"architects, writers, musicians and 'revolutionaries' in all the arts\\". Clipping in the Indianapolis Museum of Art Archives. In the 1930s, La Tour traveled extensively in Europe. She had a close relationship with artist Arnold Franz Brasz, with whom she shared a studio in the Beechwood area of Hollywood, California. She sat as an artist's model for many artists (see #Art Portraits of Onya La Tour). In 1935, La Tour moved to Puerto Rico with Antonio Colorado, where she directed a gallery. =New York City= Later in 1935, La Tour moved from Puerto Rico to New York City. There she became friends with many later prominent artists, operated several galleries (see next section), and acquired hundreds of artworks, often directly from the artists. From 1936 to 1939, La Tour had a romantic relationship with Maurice Jungbeck. They lived at 596 Riverside Drive, New York City, which also housed the Onya La Tour Gallery (see #Galleries). \\"As a result of occasional disputes with Jungbeck, Onya began to spend some time in Indianapolis [Indiana] in 1938 and 1939.\\" =Galleries= La Tour owned and/or operated the following art galleries. * 1935, an art gallery in Puerto Rico. La Tour claimed that this was the first gallery in Puerto Rico to exhibit modern art. *1936‚Äì1937: La Tour directed the Federal Art Gallery of the Federal Arts Project of the Work Projects Administration, 225 W 57th St, New York NY. There were numerous posters announcing exhibits at this gallery. > \\"The WPA program made no distinction between representational and > nonrepresentational art. Abstraction had not yet gained favor in the 1930s > and 1940s and, thus, was virtually unsalable. As a result, the Federal Art > Project supported such iconic artists as Jackson Pollock before their work > could earn them income.\\" Quoted from Federal Art Project#Background. *1937‚Äì1939: Onya La Tour Gallery, 596 Riverside Drive (Harlem), New York NY, opened October 22, 1937. A poster for this gallery can be viewed online. La Tour claimed that this was the first gallery in the US to specialize in abstract art. *1939:1939 is mentioned as the date of a catalog from the West 8th St. Gallery in a taped interview, July 24, 1975, of La Tour by Ellen Lee (Curator at the Indianapolis Museum of Art) on Tape 2 shortly after 20 min. Digital versions of these tapes are available from the Archives of the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields, Indianapolis, Indiana: Onya La Tour papers (M005), Series 6 Box 10 Folder 5. 25 West 8th Street, New York City, no further information. Possibly this Gallery was established after La Tour stopped living with Maurice Jungbeck at 596 Riverside Drive. This region of Greenwich Village was a vibrant art scene in the 1930s. *1940‚Äì47: Indiana Museum for Modern Art, Brown County, Indiana. La Tour purchased this property in October, 1939, and opened the Museum in summer of 1940. It was located between Nashville Indiana and Columbus Indiana. She sold the property in Fall, 1947.Information researched and provided by Kathy McKimmie. La Tour's subsequent homes Spellbound House, Saint Blue Cloud's House, and her house on Browncliff Lane also served as private galleries (see #Exhibitions). =Modernism in Indiana= Indiana Museum for Modern Art From July, 1938 to December, 1939 the bulk of La Tour's collection of approximately 500 art works by approximately 100 artists was warehoused in Indianapolis. La Tour moved with her daughter from New York to Indiana in the winter of 1939‚Äì40. A small exhibit was displayed in a private home in Indianapolis in Spring, 1940. La Tour's Museum opened in summer, 1940 (see links below photographs and a painting of the Museum below). A larger, rotating exhibit was held at Indiana University, Bloomington, in Fall, 1940 (see Exhibitions). This enabled her to move her collection temporarily to Indiana University, because the fire hazard was high in the dry Fall at the new Museum. La Tour lived in the barn so the farmhouse could be used as the Museum gallery. She envisioned classes in handicrafts, gardening, and sewing for the local children, but these plans may never have come to fruition. Spellbound House In 1947 and 1948, La Tour bought land closer to the town and artists' colony of Nashville, Indiana. There she designed and built a concrete-block home that she called Spellbound House (see links below to photographs and painting of this home). Saint Blue Cloud's House Sometime in the 1950s, La Tour designed and began building (mostly with her own labor A clipping of this article is in the Indianapolis Museum of Art Archives. La Tour is quoted as describing herself carrying buckets of seething hot tar up a rickety ladder to seal the roof of St. Blue Cloud's House.) a wood frame house across the road from Spellbound House. This new home she called Saint Blue Cloud's House. Many photographs of this house taken in 1958‚Äì1963 are in the Indianapolis Museum of Art Archive,Folder 14: Eric Martz photo disk 2014, in Box 10, Series 6 Historical Files. and see the link below under #Homes to a photograph of this house. Fire: In 1962, La Tour was away for months, and the electricity was turned off. When she returned from New York City around Thanksgiving, an electrician turned the electricity on while La Tour was shopping in Nashville. Just as La Tour returned home about noon, moisture caused an electric box near the kitchen to burst into flame. She phoned for help. While the fire consumed some paintings, papers, books and a closet, volunteer firemen arrived and threw other paintings out on the lawn. Shortly, the city water supply failed. Luckily, La Tour had had a cistern built, which enabled the fire to be put out. Locals teased her about constructing a cistern when she had city water, but without the cistern, the fire would have burned down the house. It is not known how many works of art were lost in the fire. Browncliff Lane La Tour and her husband in the 1960s, Carl McCann, designed and built a \\"dream house\\" on North Browncliff Lane in Bloomington, Indiana. It was completed in 1968. Whereas her three previous homes had been built and operated on very limited funds, this final home was lavishly funded by McCann. Ca. 1970, La Tour and McCann also spent winters in Green Valley, Arizona.Letters from Onya La Tour McCann to Karl Martz and Becky Martz in 1970, return address Green Valley, Arizona, one postmarked November 20, 1970, Tucson, Arizona. =Partners, family and daughter= Siblings Onya had a number of siblingsAccording to Onya La Tour's daughter Manya Cheren in a phone interview in April, 2019, by Eric Martz., including the two mentioned here. :Brother: Alva \\"Al\\" J. La Toor (1908‚Äì1958) was Onya La Tour's half brother, born to La Tour's father Simon Tarr and his second wife. He resided in California for 10 years, and in 1953, took up residence in Nashville, Indiana.Obituary for Al La Toor, July 2, 1958 newspaper clipping in the Indianapolis Museum of Art Archives, from an unidentified newspaper. He was a painter and leather craftsman. La Toor's studio was at 100 South Van Buren St., Nashville, Indiana, a distinctive building with 3 large windows in the front, still in use in 2018. :Sister: Merle Carrie Tarr, who died at a young age. Daughter Manya La Tour was born ca. 1926 on the homestead near Spokane, Washington. Later, they lived in California. When Manya was 8 1/2 (1934), Onya left her at a Catholic boarding school for poor children, in Paris, France. Onya made little or no contact with Manya at this school, and Manya felt abandoned. After a year in the school, Manya's Great Aunt Eleanor Kellock settled the account at the school for $900 ($16,500 in 2018 dollars), and took Manya home. Manya graduated from Shortridge High School in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1943. Manya and her mother had a difficult relationship, and Manya left home at age 16.Information from a November, 2014 phone interview of Manya La Tour Cheren, daughter of Onya La Tour, then living in Sebastopol, California. Partners Dates are approximate. *1910s: There is some evidence that La Tour may have had two marriages in Oklahoma, one to a man named Cicle.Information from an October, 2018 phone interview of Manya La Tour Cheren, daughter of Onya La Tour, then living in Sebastopol, California. *1920s: Albro Latimer Kellock, a violinist from Scotland. They met at Graceland College in Lamona Iowa, and married December 3, 1920, in Jeffersonville, Indiana. They lived in at the homestead near Spokane and later in Seattle, Washington. *Late 1920s/Early 1930s: La Tour met Arnold Franz Brasz when he was President of the California Watercolor Society. She shared a home and studio with Brasz, whom she may have married, first in Washington State and later in Hollywood, California. *1933: La Tour and her daughter lived with artist Philip Ayer Sawyer for a while. In 1934, La Tour lived in Sawyer's Paris studio while he remained in New York City. Later, in the early 1940s, La Tour provided Sawyer with a studio that was part of the Indiana Museum of Modern Art. Letters from Sawyer to La Tour indicate a difficult relationship. Whether it had a romantic component is not clear. *1935: La Tour moved to Puerto Rico with Antonio Colorado. Later she decided not to marry Colorado and moved to New York City. * 1930s? La Tour may have had a romantic relationship with Oronzo Vito Gasparo.Two portraits of La Tour, objects 75.123 and 75.126 in the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA), are titled Onya LaTour Gasparo by the Smithonian and the National Portrait Gallery, but these portraits are not so-titled at the IMA. It is unclear whether the titles that include Gasparo as part of her name are in error. *Late 1930s: Maurice Jungbeck, a writer, at 596 Riverside Drive, New York NY, which was also the Onya La Tour Gallery. *1940s: A 1943 portrait of La Tour is labeled Onya La Tour Dahl. Whether this indicates a romantic relationship, and the full name of Dahl, are unknown. *1950s: Emanuel Glicen Romano spent months at a time living with La Tour. It is uncertain to what extent this was a romantic relationship, but Romano inscribed a 1950 portrait \\"To dearest Onya, with love, E. Romano\\" (see #Art Portraits of Onya La Tour). Furthermore, a note in La Tour's diary calls 1951 \\"the peak of her existence\\" because Romano was with her. *1960s: La Tour married Indiana art enthusiast Carl McCann. In addition to building her a new house of her design, McCann took La Tour on a world tour, bought her an expensive car and other gifts. =Decline and Death= In 1972, with failing health, La Tour donated her remaining art collection (over 100 works) and papers to the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Near the end of her life, La Tour developed Parkinson's disease, and had cataracts that rendered her blind. Carl McCann had a stroke and died in January, 1976. La Tour died in June the same year, and was buried at Greenlawn Cemetery, Nashville, Indiana. She spent her last days in a nursing facility in Greenwood, Indiana. Towards the end, her good friend Ellen Lee, a Senior Curator at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, sometimes drove La Tour to spend a few hours at St. Blue Cloud's house. La Tour deeded her property to the Roman Catholic Church, and willed funds for construction of a community center in Nashville, Indiana, which were used for a conference room in the Brown County Library. The \\"local carpenter\\" referenced in the story is the author, Henry \\"Hank\\" Swain, who also helped with construction of the Karl Martz Studio, which neighbored La Tour's Spellbound and Blue Cloud houses.

The film is based on the novel of the same name by J. M. Coetzee. It stars Mark Rylance, Johnny Depp, Robert Pattinson, Gana Bayarsaikhan, and Greta Scacchi. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 6, 2019. It was released on August 7, 2020, by Samuel Goldwyn Films. Plot The Magistrate (Mark Rylance) manages an outpost on the frontiers of an unnamed Empire. The state of affairs is pacific and there are minor misunderstandings. At this point in marches Colonel Joll (Johnny Depp) who immediately requests to be briefed on the state of the affairs on the frontiers because of his ignorance. The Magistrate tries his best but Colonel Joll remains pessimistic, apparent when he apprehends, accuses, and incarcerates an innocent man and his nephew for being sheep rustlers. Colonel Joll not only disbelieves in their innocence but proceeds to torture them, resulting in the man's death. The Magistrate confronts Colonel Joll about the torture and death to which Colonel Joll presents the nephew's (extorted & false) confession to a fantastical notion of a barbarian uprising. Colonel Joll then forces the tortured nephew to take them to his deceased uncle's tribe where Joll apprehends women and elderly men as \\"prisoners of war\\". Colonel Joll departs the next day, which prompts the Magistrate to immediately release all the \\"prisoners of war\\". A few months later one of the prisoners of war with two broken ankles (Gana Bayarsaikhan) is seen panhandling in the streets. The Magistrate gives her food & shelter, and attempts to heal her broken ankles. Some of the soldiers mistake this act of kindness for an act of lust and the girl for the Magistrate's concubine. The Magistrate learns of all the tortures she has gone through, including the death of her father. He asks her to stay at the fort but also shows willingness to return her to her people. The girl chooses the latter. After a long and arduous journey through the desert the Magistrate approaches the nomads in the mountains and attempts to restore relations with them but the nomads are upset at this point and spare him his life and his horses simply for his act of kindness towards the girl. The Magistrate returns to find Officer Mandel (Robert Pattinson), a lackey of Colonel Joll, running the fort. Officer Mandel immediately takes the Magistrate into custody, accuses him of treachery, and incarcerates him. After some time, the Magistrate exits the prison to see more \\"prisoners of war\\" being mistreated. He steps in to advocate for their release but is physically abused and tortured. He is then brought in for questioning and accused of consorting with the enemy and for taking concubines from the barbarians. The Magistrate is then publicly shamed while Colonel Joll departs with a force to drive the barbarians into the mountains. The Magistrate is himself now disheveled and dispossessed of everything. While Colonel Joll is out on the expedition the Magistrate is taken care of by one of his female cooks (Greta Scacchi). One day a horse carrying the corpse of one of the last soldiers in Colonel Joll's forces returns. Officer Mandel walks away in fear and then announces a \\"temporary scaling back of forces\\" and promptly departs the outpost. The native population feels betrayed and abandoned after the soldiers encouraged the fort's population to pillory and abuse the nomadic prisoners of war. As Officer Mandel and his men depart, the Magistrate returns to his rooms and his office to continue his studies surrounding the history of the local population. One day one of Colonel Joll's men returns asking for horses. They seem to be panicked as they run around and collect provisions. The Magistrate goes to see a pensive and thoughtful Colonel Joll sitting in his carriage. As the soldiers throw some provisions into the carriage the local population begins to pelt them with stones. The soldiers hastily depart into the night. The Magistrate returns to a town bereft of young men, where boys play-pretend to stand guard around scarecrows dressed as soldiers by the gates of the fort. The movie closes with a shadow approaching the Magistrate standing alone in the courtyard, and a cloud of dust on the horizon - dust thrown up by an army of apparently nomadic warriors headed towards the fort.

Born 17 March 1897, Wollongong, New South Wales, Married 1924 at Christ Church, Claremont to Barbara Morton Sawell, a pharmacist who died in 1978. He died 29 June 1979 at Armadale, Melbourne, was cremated, and left property amounting to around half a million dollars. Kessell left military service in 1920 to serve under the beleaguered Conservator of forest, Charles Lane Poole, assuming his role after Poole resigned in October 1921 until his official appointment in January 1923; Kessell held this position for twenty years and attempted to implement the programs forestry management established by his predecessor. While regarded as less forthright he was scathing in his criticism of contemporary practices, As Western Australian Conservator he employed untrained individuals to manage plantations and forest regeneration, developed fire strategies, both defensive and introduced as a form of silvacultural management, and sought to found his departments methods on scientific and international standards of forestry. Kessell presided over the Institute of Foresters of Australia between 1936 and 1938, a body he had acted to found in 1935. He was appointed as controller of timber at the Department of Munitions in 1941, successfully introducing a national tree policy. His criticism of Tasmanian forest policy in 1944 stated that the department and forests were compromised by private interests, his identification of Australian Newsprint Mills new operations at Boyer, Tasmania saw his appointment as managing director in 1946 in an effort to ameliorate the political consequences. He oversaw improvements to practices and overcame national shortages to improve the sustainability of the mills production, although his recommendation to expand operations in 1958 was unsuccessful. He retired from the A.N.M. board in 1962. Amongst Kessell's legacies in improving forestry in the nation was the incorporation of the Australian Forestry School into the Australian National University. He was a member of the Weld Club, the Tasmanian Club, and eventually Australian Club, deputy of the National Safety Council, and appointed M.B.E. in 1951.

It is composed of statements made by Trump during his visit to affected areas in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. Proceeds from sales are to be donated to organizations that support victims of both Florence and the later Hurricane Michael. According to The Late Show, as of December 19, 2018, it has sold over 400,000 copies and raised $1.5 million. Overview Whose Boat Is This Boat? is composed of quotes made by Donald Trump during his visit to affected areas on September 19, 2018, in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. The title, according to Stephen Colbert, is drawn from an \\"impassioned, and truly heartfelt response to this one boat that washed ashore.\\" During his visit, Trump made a number of comments about a boat that had been shipwrecked on the property of a survivor and homeowner in New Bern, North Carolina. These included statements such as \\"at least you got a nice boat out of the deal\\"; \\"Is this your boat? Or did it become your boat?\\"; and \\"To see what we're seeing‚Äîthis boat, I don't know what happened, but this boat just came here.\\" The book is credited to \\"Donald J. Trump (by accident).\\" However, the publisher, Simon & Schuster, credits authorship to The Staff of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which it describes as: \\"bipedal mammals. They were born on earth and currently reside in the New York City area. Their hobbies include kayaking.\\" Proceeds from the book will go to benefit several charitable organizations aiding victims of the hurricane, including the World Central Kitchen. According to Colbert, publishing the book would ensure that \\"Donald Trump's comments about that boat are helping in spite of him.\\" The book's blurb describes it as \\"An excellent teaching tool for readers of all ages who enjoy learning about empathy by process of elimination.\\" Colbert reflected upon the announcement of the book, \\"It's the perfect gift for young readers and presidents who don't read.\\" Simon & Schuster's press release says \\"Research suggests this will be the first children's book ever published that demonstrates what not to say after a natural disaster.\\" It also quotes company president Jonathan Karp, who wrote: > Donald Trump has described himself as the Ernest Hemingway of Twitter. With > this book, he proves himself to be the Dr. Seuss of hurricane literature. Release and sales The book was released on November 6, 2018, the same day as the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. The week of October 21, 2018, it was the second best selling non-fiction book on Amazon.com. On November 15, 2019, following reports that the book had repeatedly been hidden or gone missing at Coeur d'Alene Public Library in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, The Late Show donated to the library a rare, oversized \\"unhideable edition\\" of the book, measuring 4 feet wide and 3 feet tall.

It also occurs in neighbouring south-central Goi√°s to the north. It is endemic to Brazil, occurring only in this country. Etymology The specific epithet refers to the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul where it was first found. Taxonomy The taxon was first collected in 2000 by E.R. Salviani and Harri Lorenzi in the municipality of Tr√™s Lagoas in Mato Grosso do Sul.Campos Rocha A, Lorenzi H (2018). HPL - Herb√°rio do Jardim Bot√¢nico Plantarum. Version 1.43.

Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/ymks0x accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-11-10. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1099310340 In 2008 a group of botanists consisting of Larry R. Noblick, Lorenzi, Tsuji and R. Ventura collected the taxon again (Tsuji2674).Campos Rocha A, Lorenzi H (2018). HPL - Herb√°rio do Jardim Bot√¢nico Plantarum. Version 1.43. Jardim Bot√¢nico Plantarum. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/ymks0x accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-11-10. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1099310315 This is the type collection. Note that the textual locality description as entered by Noblick in 2010 is confused, there is no municipality called Nova Ponte in the vicinity, but there is a 'new bridge' across the Paran√° River in Tr√™s Lagoas on the highway to √Ågua Clara. Soares has this same collection occurring in the municipality of √Ågua Clara, and provides slightly different georeferenced data than in the original voucher, but this points to a spot in Tr√™s Lagoas along a road off the highway close-by where the original georeferenced data indicates a spot along the highway (which corresponds to the textual location description by Tsuji). Eslab√£o subsequently has this collection occurring in the municipality of Rio Verde de Mato Grosso, which also has a new bridge -and there is also a Rio Verde in Tr√™s Lagoas. In 2010 Noblick eventually described B. matogrossensis from the afore-mentioned collections, as well as B. catarinensis and B. pubispatha, in the Flora brasileira: Arecaceae (palmeiras) by Lorenzi et al. (Noblick also described B. lepidotispatha in 2010). The holotype selected was the last of the afore-mentioned collections, Tsuji2674 from 2008. It was apparently also collected by Kelen Pureza Soares and R. Pimenta in 2012 in the municipality of √Ågua Clara, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, although the georeferenced data provided shows a location in Tr√™s Lagoas near the three earlier afore-mentioned collections. Description This is a small solitary-trunked palm, the trunk can grow above ground or be subterranean, growing up to high and in diameter. It has 6-15 leaves. The long by wide petiole of the leaf has toothed margins. The rachis of the leaf is in length and bears 23-32 pairs of pinnae (leaflets). These pinnae are arranged on a single plane on each side of the rachis, such that the pairs form a V-shape down the leaf blade. The pinnae are sized in length and in width in the middle of the leaf. The developing inflorescence is protected within a hairless, woody spathe in length, with the enlarged part of the spathe being long and in width. The inflorescence is branched with 7-35 rachillae (branches) which are in length. The flowers are coloured purple. The staminate (male) flowers are in length; the pistillate (female) flowers are in length. The shape of the fruit is ovoid; the nut is an ellipsoid/ovoid shape and contains 1-3 seeds. Ripe fruit has a yellow and sweet-sour flesh. The ripe fruit is described as coloured purplish-green, green or red. At the type locality a plant has been found with a trunk to high, although this would appear to be rare. The leaves arch strongly back down towards the trunk and are described as coloured \\"pale bluish green\\", \\"mint green\\" or \\"green-blue\\". =Similar species= It is extremely similar to Butia capitata, juvenile specimens of that species being very easy to confuse with this one. According to Soares in 2015 the main difference between these two species is that B. matogrossensis has much smaller fruit with a purplish hue, compared to the big yellow fruit of B. capitata. Noblick in his 2014 key to the genus Butia also contrasts it to B. capitata, distinguishing the two species from each other by B. matogrossensis having a usually subterranean trunk, a shorter leaf rachis, less pinnae, a smaller swollen portion of the spathe, much less rachillae and the ripe fruit being green or purplish-green as opposed to yellow. It is also very similar to B. arenicola, but is much larger than this dwarf species. Marcelo Piske Eslab√£o in his 2017 key to the genus contrasts it to B. arenicola, distinguishing the two species by B. matogrossensis having generally red fruit as opposed to yellow, and a petiole almost twice as wide, a spathe over twice as wide, and larger pistillate flowers. It grows in the same regional vicinity as B. archeri and B. purpurascens in southern Goi√°s, and B. arenicola and B. campicola in Mato Grosso do Sul, with B. paraguayensis occurring just to the west, south and east of its range. Distribution It is native to the cerrados of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in south-central Brazil. In 2015 Soares wrote that it had a very restricted distribution in the east of Mato Grosso do Sul in the neighbouring municipalities of √Ågua Clara and Tr√™s Lagoas, but as of 2017 more collection localities have been identified. These include collections in the municipalities of Campo Grande and Terenos by A.C. Marcato in 2001 (at the University of S√£o Paulo herbarium), collections in Campo Grande in 2005 and Inoc√™ncia in 2008 by Roberto Tsuji (at the Jardim Bot√¢nico Plantarum) in the central and north-eastern regions of Mato Grosso do Sul. On the Flora do Brasil 2020 website it states that this species also occurs in the neighbouring state of Goi√°s. It is unclear what substantiates this distribution as none of the specimen vouchers cited were collected in this state. In 2009 a specimen was collected in the municipality of Caiap√¥nia in south-central Goi√°s by Renata Corr√™a Martins et al. which she herself considered Butia archeri in her 2012 dissertation, but which Eslab√£o classified as B. matogrossensis in his 2017 thesis. This plant has thus only been collected nine times since 2000, in at least five localities, as of 2017. With an estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of some 7,000km2 within an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of approximately 11,300km2, it has a calculated abundance of 62%, which is average to good compared to other species within the genus Butia. =Habitat= It grows in a shrubby subtype of cerrado known as 'central Brazilian savannah'. It appears to prefer sandy soils. The elevation has only been measured at one of its collection localities, this was at 330m altitude in Tr√™s Lagoas. It has often been found growing in the berms along highways, at least initially. Horticulture Seeds are difficult to germinate. According to one grower the best results were obtained germinating them in quite dry peat. USDA hardiness zone 9b. Seed has been sold by speciality seed vendors since at least 2015. Seedlings have been sold in Germany. Conservation As of 2018 the Centro Nacional de Conserva√ß√£o da Flora has not yet rated the conservation status for Brazil, and it is listed as 'not evaluated'. Eslab√£o in his 2017 thesis classifies Butia matogrossensis as 'vulnerable' as the IUCN categories B1a,b(i, ii, iii) apply; this means that the estimated EOO (see Distribution above) was lower than 20,000km2, it occurs in less than 10 localities, and that according to Eslab√£o the population was highly fragmented and in decline. According to Lorenzi et al. in 2010 the region whence it inhabits was experiencing an increase in soya cultivation. It is not known to occur and/or be protected within any conservation area. It was grown ex situ in the Jardim Bot√¢nico Plantarum in Nova Odessa, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, by 2017.

Tanaschishin joined a Soviet partisan unit during the Russian Civil War and was transferred to the Red Army, with which he fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, being captured by Polish troops but released. During the interwar period he held cavalry command positions and in the early 1930s became an officer of the armored forces. When Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began, Tanaschishin commanded a tank regiment encircled in Belarus. He escaped and was decorated for his leadership of a motorcycle regiment during the Battle of Moscow. After commanding a tank brigade on the Southwestern Front in mid-1942, Tanaschishin was appointed commander of the 13th Tank Corps. For his leadership of the corps, which became the 4th Guards Mechanized Corps for its actions in the Battle of Stalingrad, Tanaschishin was again decorated and promoted to major general. He continued to lead the 4th Guards Mechanized in combat until he was mortally wounded in an air raid at the end of March 1944.  Early life, Russian Civil War, and Polish‚ÄìSoviet War  Tanaschishin was born on 31 January 1903 in Yaryshev (now in Mohyliv-Podilskyi Raion of Vinnytsia Oblast). He joined a Red Army partisan detachment under the command of Chebanov in March 1918, fighting in Ukraine against German troops and the forces of Pavlo Skoropadskyi. The partisan detachment was reorganized as the 1st Serebrysky Regiment towards the end of the year, in which Tanaschishin became a mounted scout. In 1919, on the Southwestern Front, he fought against the Armed Forces of South Russia and the Ukrainian People's Army. The regiment suffered heavy losses in the fighting and following this he joined the 395th Rifle Regiment. In the spring of 1920 Tanaschishin fought with the regiment in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, fell seriously ill and became a straggler in Ukrainian People's Army territory. After recovering, he tried to rejoin his unit but was captured on 19 May and imprisoned in the Mogilyovsky Prison until July, when he was released by advancing Soviet troops. He joined the 535th Rifle Regiment, fighting against the Ukrainian People's Army. Between April and November 1921, he fought against anti-Soviet forces in Mogilyovsky Uyezd as assistant platoon commander in a separate special purpose cavalry battalion.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, Tanaschishin became a physical training instructor for pre-conscription training of conscripts at the local military commissariat. In August 1925 he became a student at the S.M. Budyonny Ukrainian Cavalry School in Yelizavetgrad. After graduation in September 1928, he served in the 9th Cavalry Division as a platoon commander in the 52nd Cavalry Regiment, then in the 54th Separate Reserve Squadron. In May 1931, Tanaschishin graduated from the Leningrad Armored Commanders' Improvement Courses, becoming commander of a training armored platoon of the Moscow Proletarian Rifle Division motor detachment in the Moscow Military District. This assignment was brief, as he was transferred in October to the 11th Cavalry Division as acting commander and commissar of a separate mechanized squadron, and commander of a training armored platoon. In April 1932 he became political officer of the training squadron of its 11th Mechanized Regiment, then commander of a tank squadron, and assistant regimental chief of staff. Between November 1934 and May 1935 he was a student in the staff department of the Leningrad Armored Commanders' Improvement Courses, then returned to the 11th Mechanized Regiment, temporarily serving as assistant chief of staff and acting chief of staff of the regiment, then as acting regimental commander. In June 1938 he became chief of the second staff department of the 1st Tank Brigade in the Belorussian Special Military District, being appointed assistant chief of staff of the 21st Tank Brigade in the Western Special Military District in April 1940. Tanaschishin was made chief of supply for the new 4th Tank Division of the 6th Mechanized Corps in July, then commander of the 60th Tank Regiment of the latter's 30th Tank Division in March 1941.  World War II  When Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began, the regiment fought in the engagements that became known as the border battles in Soviet historiography and was surrounded with the 10th Army of the Western Front. Tanaschishin managed to escape the encirclement and became commander of the 36th Separate Motorcycle Regiment in August, part of the 5th Army of the Western Front during the Battle of Moscow, during which it participated in fierce defensive battles in the Mozhaysk direction. He was characterized by a superior as a \\"resolute, courageous, and bold commander\\" whose \\"personal skill, example, and courage\\" enabled a series of attacks against German forces at Vereya and Mozhaysk. His \\"decisive and swift actions\\" were credited with causing the defeat of the vanguard of the 7th Panzer Division in front of Borisovo, and a counterattack he led at Nikiforovskoye was credited with preventing a German occupation of the southeast bank of the Moskva River. For his leadership Tanaschishin received the Order of the Red Banner and the regiment became the 1st Guards Motorcycle Regiment. Tanaschishin was transferred to command the 36th Tank Brigade, part of the Moscow Military District, in December. In April 1942 it was transferred to the newly formed 22nd Tank Corps of the 38th Army, fighting on the Southwestern Front. On 17 July he was promoted to command the 13th Tank Corps, which went on to fight as part of the 1st Tank, 64th, and 57th Armies of the Stalingrad Front in the Battle of Stalingrad. For its courage the corps became the 4th Guards Mechanized Corps and received the Stalingrad honorific, while 64th Army commander Major General Mikhail Shumilov wrote that Tanaschishin showed \\"initiative and versatility, strictness, decisiveness, and discipline, ability to control tank units in battle, to maneuver units and fight against superior German forces, and organize troops to perform combat missions.\\" He led the corps through its repulse of the German counterattack during Operation Winter Storm and the advance to the Mius River. Tanaschishin led the corps in the Rostov, Donbass, Melitopol, Nikopol‚ÄìKrivoi Rog Offensives as part of the Southern Front (the 4th Ukrainian Front from 20 October 1943) in 1943 and early 1944, during which it captured Amvrosiivka and Bolshoy Tokmak, among others. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 30 August 1943. In March 1944 the corps fought as part of the Cavalry-Mechanized Group of General Issa Pliyev with the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the Bereznegovatoye‚ÄìSnigirevka Offensive and the Odessa Offensive, capturing Novyi Buh among others, For its actions in these battles the corps received the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class.

James Herbert of Kingsey, Buckinghamshire. In 1676, aged seven, he succeeded to the baronetcy and the manor of Appuldurcombe on the death of his father. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 17 December 1684, aged 15. He married by licence dated 13 August 1690 Frances Thynne, daughter of Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, of Longleat, Wiltshire. alt= Worsley was Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire from 1699 to 1702. In 1702, he started rebuilding Appuldurcombe House which had been in his family since 1527. The architect was John James. Worsley had an interest at the parliamentary seat of Newtown (Isle of Wight). His brother Henry represented the seat from 1705 but was sent as Ambassador to Portugal in 1713. Worsley stood in his brother's place at the 1715 general election, was returned as Member of Parliament for the seat and acted as place-holder for his brother in case he returned from Portugal. He was classed as a Tory but often voted with the Whigs. He supported the Administration on the Peerage Bill but voted against the Septennial Bill and the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts. He did not stand again in 1722; his brother Henry had another posting as Governor of Barbados. Worsley died on 29 July 1747, with seven surviving daughters but no male heir. He left his mainland Hampshire property to Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville, the son of his daughter, Frances. The baronetcy went to his cousin James Worsley. He had never seen his house at Appuldurcombe fully completed; it passed in trust to Sir Thomas Worsley, 6th Baronet, the son of his cousin James.

The Confederate Memorial Monument is a monument installed outside the Alabama State Capitol. Description and history On the north side of Capitol Hill there is a monument dedicated to Alabama's more than 122,000 Confederate veterans of the Civil War, known as the Confederate Memorial Monument. The tall monument was dedicated on December 7, 1898, although it had been planned as early as November 1865. Funding for the monument included $20,000 in the form of two grants from the state legislature, $10,000 contributed by the Ladies Memorial Association of Alabama, $6,755 from the Historical and Monumental Association of Alabama that was formed in 1865 to support the erection of this monument, and $5,000 from politicians. Design of the monument was done by Gorda C. Doud and executed by sculptor Alexander Doyle of New York City. The design features a stepped base surmounted by statuary representing the four branches of the military. Centered on top of this is a monumental bronze and limestone column, topped with a bronze figure by Doyle representing \\"Patriotism.\\" The cornerstone was laid by Jefferson Davis on April 29, 1886. The base was built with Alabama limestone from Russellville, but problems occurred with the limestone for the column being found to be faulty. Although records are not complete, recent analysis has indicated that the column was eventually built using stone from Bedford, Indiana. Relations between Doyle and his monument clients had soured by the late 1880s. The remaining granite figures for the base, representing the military branches, were contracted from Barnicoat Monuments in Quincy, Massachusetts. Critics have repeatedly called for the monument's removal, stating that it promotes white supremacy. These removal attempts have met with considerable resistance from preservationists and others. The monument was vandalized in 2007, with black paint sprayed on the granite and limestone. On the morning of June 24, 2015, state workers wordlessly removed the four flagpoles with flags intact containing the three Flags of the Confederate States of America, along with the Confederate Battle Flag, on the orders of Governor Robert J. Bentley. This was done in the wake of the Charleston church shooting of June 17, 2015, after which many companies and states, including South Carolina, responded to calls to prohibit the Battle Flag from being displayed in public venues or sold in stores. Bentley cited he found no laws or policies requiring the flags to stay up, and wanted to prevent any distractions to come from state legislative work.

Only two prototypes were ever produced, neither of which were capable of firing due to time constraints. Neither of the vehicles were completed before their production was ceased.  Design  The Object 490A was created as an alternative variant for the Object 490. The 490A Buntar was suggested in order to provide the vehicle with one more crew member as well as an externally mounted gun. The biggest change from the Object 490 to the 490A was the completely redesigned turret as well as minor changes to the chassis. The project was cancelled at the end of 1984 due to the newer Object 477 Molot program beginning. The tank is considered to be a vehicle ahead of its time, as it utilized multiple new technologies in order to stay ahead of the competition. = Armor = The armor consisted of a layer of steel followed by composite armor, which consisted of five layers of steel separated by four layers of ceramic. The roof armor was unusually high on the hull as well as the turret in order to prevent the vehicle from being damaged by artillery. The vehicle's fuel tank was located to the right of the driver and acted as extra armor. Ammunition was stored in a compartment situated in the right side of the turret and the commander was situated right beside it. The gunner seat was placed in front of the commander. This fighting compartment was completely isolated from the rest of the tank, including from the driver who was to be situated in the front. Reactive armor (presumably Kontakt-5) was designed to be implemented to the front of the tank as well as the sides, but the production was cancelled before the vehicle reached that stage. = Armament = The vehicle sported a fire-control system (designated as \\"Argus\\"). Argus was the main computer to which the radar, thermal imager and cameras were linked to. The gun was mounted externally. The creators of the vehicle, Bazhenov and Shomin, debated over what caliber of gun should replace the previously planned 125mm 2A66M smoothbore. A 130 mm was suggested, but a 152 mm 2A73 gun would instead be the gun implemented on future models. = Mobility = The 5TDF engine manufactured in the Malyshev Factory was used as a temporary placeholder, and would be changed out for the 1500 horsepower KMDB 6TD-3 6-cylinder diesel engine. Paired with a hydraulic drive system and 580 mm wide tracks, the tank had good mobility for its weight. The tank had an approximate 31 hp/t power-to-weight ratio, allowing the vehicle to travel at 75km/h on roads and 55km/h off road.

She is best known for her work in user modeling, digital humanities, and for the CrowdTruth crowdsourcing method. She is the head of the user-centric data science (UCDS) research group in the VU Computer Science department, president of the User Modeling Society, a former vice- president of Semantic Technology Institute, Chief Scientist at Tagasauris, and a member of over 100 scientific programme committees and editorial boards. She is one of the few female full professors of Computer Science in the Netherlands, and one of only two women (out of over 20 full professors) at the VU. After leaving Bulgaria during the aftermath of the fall of communism, Aroyo obtained a PhD in Educational Science and Technology from University of Twente. She worked with Paul De Bra at Eindhoven University of Technology in the area of intelligent tutoring systems, focusing primarily on understanding and modeling the different needs of users to make the experience more productive. Her work in user modeling grew in reputation and she chaired the primary conference in the area in 2010 and became president of the User Modeling Society in 2016. Aroyo moved to the VU University in 2006 and began her seminal work in cultural heritage, later called digital humanities. With colleagues Guus Schreiber and others, she is credited with pioneering niche- sourcing, a method to motivate small communities of crowd workers who are passionate about specific topics. Often these communities are hobbyists, amateur scientists, etc., who enjoy sharing their knowledge and expertise, especially with public institutions such as museums. Aroyo led several successful campaigns with the Rijksmuseum using niche crowds to generate large amounts of metadata about the Rijksmuseum collections on line. In 2013, Aroyo spent her sabbatical working with the IBM Watson team, just after the famous Jeopardy! match, where she developed the Crowd Truth methodology with Chris Welty. Artificial intelligence systems are trained and evaluated using human- labeled data, Aroyo and Welty observed that when the people labelling the data disagree on what the right answer is, this disagreement may signal some other problem, such as ambiguity or vagueness. This is considered important, because most human-labelled data ignores the difference between high and low agreement examples. In 2018, she was listed among the top women semantic web researchers without a Wikipedia page, and was nominated to have this page authored during the Ada Lovelace women in computing hackathon, as a way to combat Gender bias on Wikipedia.

It was originally designed and developed in response to a research funding call from the UK Mental Health Foundation which required that the content must cover domains of well-being, problems, functioning and risk.

Translations  Translations of CORE-OM have been completed into 30 languages and more underway (Arabic for the CORE-OM, Arabic YP-CORE already completed, Korean and Estonian).  Short forms and related instruments  There are approved CORE- OM short forms: two 18 item versions launched with the CORE-OM in 1998, the GP-CORE for general population survey work and the CORE-10. In addition the YP-CORE, a 10 item form for young people has been developed based on the CORE- OM, as have two forms for adults with mild to moderate learning difficulties.  Similar instruments or systems and complementary measures  The CORE system philosophy was that the instruments, and practitioners and researchers should be free to use them as they saw fit: a \\"bottom up\\" philosophy rather than one of \\"top down\\" usage dictated by politics or health delivery systems. The copyleft status was intended to remove cost barriers to using the instruments while ensuring that they weren't mutated into many non-comparable forms. When CORE was launched in 1998 it rapidly became clear that there were several similar initiatives including theOutcome Measures work, in which the Outcome Measure-45 Outcome Questionnaire 45 led by Professor Michael Lambert in the USA and, also from the US, the ORS/SRS system led by Scott D. Miller and his colleagues all of which share the idea of a central \\"core\\" or issues being evaluated. At the same time it was anticipated that such \\"core\\" measures would be complemented, particularly in research work, by problem specific measures, perhaps often too long, or too costly for routine service, e.g. the Beck depression Inventory.  Health Economic (QALY) scoring  Work by Ifigenia Mavranezouli, then at the University of Sheffield focusing on health economic evaluation created the CORE-6D scoring of six items of the CORE-OM that converts their scores to a QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year) score. Alt URL  Online completion and coronavirus pandemic  Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic CORE System trust have provided free fillable PDF forms, Microsoft Forms, Qualtrics and LimeSurvey templates. An attempt to provide Google Forms was abandoned when it proved impossible to ensure that practitioners copying the forms would follow the instructions carefully enough to ensure that they didn't share data at the same time as sharing the forms.

The original source, though with much modification, can be seen at http://www.microarmormayhem.com/NATO_ORDER_OF_BATTLE_mod_8.doc. Where details are unclear, the general pattern portrayed in Isby and Kamps, Armies of NATO's Central Front, Jane's Publishing Company, 1985 has been followed. The most authoritative source for this type of information available is Ministry of Defence (Army Department), Master Order of Battle, ASD 6500-25, Ministry of Defence, 1991. Also, for United Kingdom Land Forces, HQ UKLF, UKLF ORBAT Review Action Plan, HQ UKLF, 1990. Antony Beevor wrote in 1991 that the 'Army's own Cabinet' was the Army Board of the Defence Council. The Executive Committee of the Army Board was responsible for the 'detailed management of the Army.' It included the four military members of the Army Board, including the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir John Chapple in 1989, the Second Permanent Under Secretary, and the Assistant Chief of the General Staff, a major general.Antony Beevor, Inside the British Army, 192. The Army Department consisted of four components: the General Staff, the Adjutant General's department, which dealt with recruiting, and also had the Provost Marshal (Army), a brigadier, reporting to him, though the RMP headquarters was at Roussillon Barracks, Chichester (Beevor 419); the Military Secretary's department, and the Quartermaster General's department. United Kingdom Land Forces Commander-in-Chief, UK Land Forces, General Sir Charles Huxtable HQ: Wilton HQ United Kingdom Land Forces commanded nine military districts until the spring of 1991. These districts controlled the regular army brigades in the UK (inc 1st and 5th Brigades) and the predominantly TA regional brigades. In 1984-85, the nine districts were Eastern (19th and 54th Brigades), London, North-East (2nd Infantry Division, 15, 24, and 49 Brigades), North-West District (42 Brigade), Scotland (51 and 52 Brigades), South-Eastern District (2 and 5 Brigades), South-West District (UK Contingent, ACE Mobile Force, 1, and 43 Brigades) Headquarters Wales (160 Brigade), and Western District (143 Brigade).Isby and Kamp, Armies of NATO's Central Front, 1985, 251-255. In December 1989, Headquarters UK Land Forces at Wilton directed field forces through a three-star's command, Commander UK Field Army, Lieutenant General Sir David Ramsbotham. Many of the units stationed in the United Kingdom were to move immediately to Germany to reinforce British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in case of war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. For administrative purposes these units were under command of brigade HQ based in the UK during peacetime. Such reinforcement units are indicated in the list below in italics followed by the higher command they were to reinforce in Germany in brackets. * British Gurkhas NepalSee details in Beevor, 1989 and

During 1988 the disposition of brigades in Northern Ireland changed: On 1 July 1988 3rd Infantry Brigade reformed at Armagh and became responsible for the UK-Ireland border zone from Armagh to South Londonderry. The brigade had been disbanded in September 1981 and its units and area initially been taken over by 8th Infantry Brigade. On 2 November 1988 107th (Ulster) Brigade (V) was raised and took command of all Territorial Army units in Northern Ireland, thus freeing 8th Infantry Brigade and 39th Infantry Brigade to focus on counterinsurgency operations. This structure was in force until the 1992 amalgamation of Royal Irish Rangers and Ulster Defence Regiment, after which 3rd Infantry Brigade returned to control its traditional area of County Armagh and County Down. * Headquarters Northern Ireland, Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn  HQ Northern Ireland District & 233 (Northern Ireland) Signal Squadron, Royal Signals, Lisburn  3rd Infantry Brigade, Armagh, (responsible for the UK-Ireland border zone, including County Fermanagh) * HQ 3rd Infantry Brigade & 203 Signal Squadron, Royal Signals, Armagh * 1st Battalion, Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters, Omagh * 4th (County Fermanagh) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, Enniskillen  8th Infantry Brigade, Ebrington Barracks, Derry, (covering County Londonderry, County Tyrone, and Ballymena, Ballymoney, Moyle and Northern Larne) * HQ 8th Infantry Brigade & 218 Signal Squadron, Royal Signals, Derry * 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, Ballykelly * 1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Derry * 5th (County Londonderry) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, Ballykelly * 6th (County Tyrone) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, Omagh * 8th (County Tyrone) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment Dungannon  39th Infantry Brigade, Lisburn, (covering Belfast city, and County Armagh, County Down and County Antrim (excluding Ballymena, Ballymoney, Moyle and Northern Larne)) * HQ 39th Infantry Brigade & 213 Signal Squadron, Royal Signals, Lisburn * 1st Battalion, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), Ballykinler * 3rd Battalion, Queen's Regiment, RAF Aldergrove *1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, Palace Barracks * 1st/9th (County Antrim) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment * 2nd (County Armagh) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, Armagh * 3rd (County Down) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, Ballykinler * 7th/10th (City of Belfast) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, Holywood * 11th (Craigavon) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, Portadown  107th (Ulster) Brigade (V), Lisburn *4th Battalion, Royal Irish Rangers (V), Portadown, (to BAOR for rear area security) * 5th Battalion, Royal Irish Rangers (V), Armagh, (to BAOR for rear area security) * 102nd (Ulster) Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery (V), Belfast, (to 1st Artillery Brigade, I British Corps, 32x Javelin) * 74th Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers (V), Belfast *152nd (Ulster) Ambulance Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport (V), Belfast, (to I British Corps) *254th Provost Company, Royal Military Police (V), Belfast, (to Provost Marshal BAOR) *204 (North Irish) General Hospital, Royal Army Medical Corps (V), Belfast, (to Commander Medical I British Corps) *253rd (Northern Ireland) Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps (V), Belfast, (to Commander Medical Rear Communication Zone BAOR)  Northern Ireland Regiment AAC, AAC Aldergrove * No. 655 Squadron AAC, AAC Ballykelly, (to 2nd Infantry Division, 4x Gazelle AH.1, 12x Lynx AH.7) * No. 665 Squadron AAC, (16x Gazelle AH.1) * No. 1 Flight AAC, (Reconnaissance, 5x Islander AL.1)  33rd Independent Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, Antrim  173rd Provost Company, Royal Military Police, Lisburn  175th Provost Company, Royal Military Police, Lisburn, (to Provost Marshal BAOR)  176th Provost Company, Royal Military Police, Derry, (to Provost Marshal BAOR)  225th Signal Squadron, Royal Signals, Lisburn  British Army of the Rhine  The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) was the United Kingdom's main contribution to NATO. Headquartered at JHQ Rheindahlen in West Germany and commanded by a General it consisted in peacetime of British I Corps and support troops. In the event of war with the Warsaw Pact the Commander-in- Chief of BAOR would have assumed command of NATO's Northern Army Group (NORTHAG), which was tasked with defending Northern Germany up to the river Elbe. BAOR was armed with tactical nuclear weapons and supported by Royal Air Force Germany. During transition to war, the support units of BAOR would have formed the British Rear Combat Zone headquartered in D√ºsseldorf, which would have supplied the fighting forces and guarded the lines of communication within West Germany. Further West in Belgium was the British Communications Zone, which was headquartered in Emblem, outside Antwerp and tasked with receiving reinforcements and supplies from Great Britain and to co-ordinate their onward movement to 1 (BR) Corps. On 27 November 1989 Peter Inge became the commander of NATO‚Äôs Northern Army Group and Commander-in-Chief, British Army of the Rhine in Germany with the local rank of general; he succeeded General Brian Kenny. * British Army of the Rhine, JHQ Rheindahlen, Federal Republic of Germany No. 12 Flight AAC, RAF Wildenrath, (Gazelle AH.1)  Commander Engineers BAOR, JHQ Rheindahlen *40th Army Engineer

Premise The film is based on an infamous 148-tweet Twitter thread in which Zola meets a sex worker named Stefani at a restaurant where Zola waitresses, and the two immediately bond over pole dancing. Only a day after they exchange numbers, Stefani invites Zola on a cross-country road trip, where the goal is to make as much money as possible dancing in Florida strip clubs. Zola agrees, and suddenly she is trapped in the craziest, most unexpected trip of her life, partaking in a wild two-day trip with Stefani, her boyfriend Derrek, and Stefani's violent pimp, X.

About a month later, Rolling Stone's David Kushner published an article interviewing people involved in the story; while the article noted several inconsistencies in the stories, and Wells has admitted to embellishing some of the more sensational detail, most of the involved have admitted to the general gist of the story. In February 2016, it was announced James Franco would direct the film, from a screenplay by Andrew Neel and Mike Roberts. Franco, Vince Jolivette, Christine Vachon, David Hinojosa, and Kara Baker would serve as producers on the film, under their Rabbit Bandini Productions, Killer Films and Gigi Films banners, respectively. In January 2018, it was announced the film was initially set to begin production in February 2018, but was shelved following sexual misconduct allegations against Franco. In June 2018, it was announced Janicza Bravo would direct the film, replacing Franco, while A24 would distribute. In October 2018, Taylour Paige was cast in the film to play the lead role. That same month, Riley Keough, Nicholas Braun, Colman Domingo and Jason Mitchell joined the cast of the film. In November 2018, Ari'el Stachel joined the cast of the film. =Filming= Principal photography began on October 29, 2018. Production concluded on December 7, 2018.

A horror reimagining and prequel to ABC's 1977 television series of the same name, it stars Michael Pe√±a, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Portia Doubleday, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hansen, and Michael Rooker. Produced by Wadlow and Marc Toberoff, as well as Jason Blum through his Blumhouse Productions banner, the film follows five people who visit the eponymous island, discovering that their dream fantasies brought to life begin to turn into horrific living nightmares they must try to survive. Fantasy Island was released in the United States on February 14, 2020 by Sony Pictures Releasing. It was critically panned, but was a box office success, grossing $47 million worldwide against its $7 million production budget. Plot Gwen, Patrick, Melanie, and brothers JD and Brax, arrive by airplane at Fantasy Island after winning a contest. They are greeted by resort worker Julia, and speculate about how the resort will fulfill their fantasies. The island's proprietor, Mr. Roarke, arrives and explains that each of them will be given one fantasy and that they must see it through to its conclusion, even if its result is not as the wisher intended. Roarke then guides the guests to their wishes. JD and Brax are taken to a mansion where they become the guests of honor at a party thrown by gorgeous models. After much partying, armed men storm the mansion and take the brothers hostage. The mansion had belonged to a drug dealer and the men are looking for money and illicit drugs. Patrick, a police officer, is given a chance to live out his fantasy of serving in the military. However, he is soon captured by American special forces commandos who disbelieve his story. The commandos are on a mission to rescue American citizens being held hostage. They introduce him to their commander, who Patrick recognizes as his father. He realizes that he is taking part in the mission which lead to his father's death when Patrick was a child. Roarke gives Gwen the chance to correct her greatest regret: turning down her boyfriend Allen's marriage proposal five years earlier. She is transported back to the restaurant where Allen proposed. This time she accepts his proposal and suddenly finds herself vacationing with Allen and their daughter. Melanie is shown to an underground torture chamber where Sloane, a girl who had mercilessly bullied her in high school, is tied up. Melanie tortures Sloane, including posting a video of Sloane's infidelity on social media where her husband can see it. But when Melanie sees a video of Sloane being abducted, she realizes that this is all real and helps free her. The two of them escape from a demented surgeon named Dr. Torture and flee into the jungle. The individual fantasies begin to converge. Brax manages to get into the mansion's armory and hold some of the drug dealers hostage with a grenade. Patrick manages to convince his father of his identity, and the team arrives at the mansion where they kill the drug dealers and rescue Brax. However, JD is shot and killed. Melanie and Sloane confront their past and reconcile. They are then rescued by Damon, a private investigator who has been stuck on the island since he came there to investigate it. He shows them to an underground grotto with a magical stone which can show people their fantasies. The water in the grotto can grant fantasies when it is drunk. Damon tells them that he has a pilot waiting nearby and gives them a phone number to call for rescue. Damon is killed by the relentless Dr. Torture, but the two women escape back to the hotel where they phone the plane for rescue. There they reunite with Brax and Patrick. Gwen becomes dissatisfied with her fantasy. Roarke explains that he is living out his own fantasy of being reunited with his wife, Julia, who had died while they were searching for the island. To keep her real, he must remain on the island forever. Gwen realizes that her greatest regret is not rejecting Allen's proposal, but an event six years ago where she failed to save her neighbor Nick from a fire which she had accidentally started. The island takes her back in time to the night of the fire where she sees that Brax and JD also lived in the apartment and Patrick was a police officer who responded but who ignores her pleas to help save Nick. Gwen tries to rescue Nick but is overcome by smoke and must be rescued by Julia. Reuniting with the other guests, they flee into the jungle to avoid Roarke and his men. Gwen realizes that they are all connected to Nick somehow, with Melanie having been a classmate of his who had agreed to a date with him but then changed his mind. They realize that someone brought them there for a revenge fantasy, with Melanie speculating that Julia might be Nick's mother. Melanie takes them down into the caverns, where the group becomes separated. Patrick is ambushed by his fantasy and Sloane confronts a manifestation of her cruel younger self, which she decisively rejects. The drug dealers and Dr. Torture arrive, taking everyone hostage. Melanie explains that this is really her fantasy. She had made a special connection with Nick, and had been supposed to go on a date with him that night, finally overcoming her crippling self esteem issues, and had been devastated when she saw that he died. Roarke arrives and says that he cannot stop Melanie's fantasy, but reminds them that anyone who drinks the water will be granted a fantasy. Sloane drinks the water and reveals her fantasy: that Melanie and Nick should be together forever. Nick's charred corpse emerges and pulls Melanie into the water. With her fantasy ended, the drug dealers and Dr. Torture disappear. Before Melanie is drowned, she lobs the grenade thrown in the water at the remaining guests, but Patrick throws himself onto it before it detonates. Sloane, Gwen, and Brax wake up at the resort and are told by Roarke of Patrick's death. The remaining guests make headway to the plane to travel back to the mainland. Roarke informs Brax that he had merely partaken in his brother's fantasy and had not been granted one of his own. Brax decides that his fantasy is for his brother to be alive and return to the outside world. JD appears in the plane, which departs. Roarke warns Brax that for the fantasy to last, Brax must remain on the island forever. Brax agrees to remain as Roarke's new assistant and, based on an old college nickname, is given the name Tattoo.

He also published the first French edition of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Life Jouin was born in 1844 in Angers in a family of Catholic artisans. His father died when he was four, and he was sent to a novitiate of the Dominican Order to be educated. From there, he moved to the seminary of Angers and was ordained as a priest in 1868. From Angers, he moved to Paris in 1875, where he served as a parish priest until the end of his life. He strongly criticized the anti-clerical measures introduced by the government of √âmile Combes, and was sentenced in 1907 to a fine for his writings regarded as subversive. He attributed the incident to Freemasonry and joined several anti-Masonic organizations before founding his own. In 1912, Jouin founded the Ligue Franc-Catholique. The league's journal, the Revue internationale des soci√©t√©s secr√®tes, was one of the two main anti-Semitic tribunes of the interwar period (along with the paper of the Action Fran√ßaise). Revue often published right-wing antisemitic canards from Russian, such as hoaxes about blood libel, and claims that Bolshevism was a Judeo- Masonic plot. Describing the Protocols, Jouin wrote: \\"From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity.\\" Pope Benedict XV made Jouin an Honorary Prelate. Pope Pius XI praised Jouin for \\"combating our mortal [Jewish] enemy\\" and appointed him to high papal office as a protonotary apostolic.

It offered mixed-sex education to around 200 pupils aged 11‚Äì16. In November 2017, plans were announced to close the school. Following two failed court appeals, the school closed in July 2019. Planned closure and reactions =Background= In November 2017, plans were announced to close Cymer Afan on 31 August 2019. Consultation started on 11 December 2017, ending on 26 January 2018. The reasons for the planned closure included the school's ¬£3m maintenance bill, the high amount of money spent on the school's pupils compared to other schools in the area, and the large gap between the school's capacity of 640 pupils and the 229 on roll. In June 2018, members of Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council voted in support of the school's closure. =Legal action= A community action group of parents was formed to oppose the plans, their legal representative calling the plan \\"a death sentence for the community\\". A judicial review was prepared for the group, focusing on the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. The BBC described the group's aims as being \\"landmark\\". In December 2018, solicitors representing the group served the council with notice of a judicial review application. The High Court saw the case in March 2019, but dismissed it on the grounds that judicial review was not the appropriate way to enforce the Future Generations Act. A second judge also dismissed the review. =Other responses to the plans= A council report showed 433 written objections from pupils, parents, staff and members of the community, including Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon. A petition with 2007 signatures was also received. The school's chair of governors opposed the planned closure, calling it a \\"devastating blow\\" to the area. The National Education Union criticised the plans, arguing that the council \\"failed to safeguard the jobs of staff\\" and \\"did not adequately consult\\" the local community. However, council leader Robert Jones stated that he was \\"100% confident\\" in their consultation process. Aftermath Following the dismissal of the judicial reviews, the school closed in July 2019. A report indicated the presence of asbestos within the school, and plans were put before the council to demolish the building. A majority of students transferred to Ysgol Cwm Brombil, a new-build school in Margam.

Location The power station would lie at Kibuka Falls, across the Tana River, a in the vicinity of Mwingi National Reserve, at the border between Kitui County and Tharaka-Nithi County, approximately north- east of the city of Nairobi, the country's capital and its largest city. This location is downstream of the Seven Forks Scheme. Overview This development is part of the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor project (LAPSSET). The dam is expected to create a lake with a surface area of and holding of water. An estimated 4,500 families in Kitui and Tharaka Nithi counties, are expected to be displaced by the new dam. In addition to the planned 693 megawatts of electricity, the dam will provide water for the irrigation of more than of farmland. The dam is also expected to mitigate flooding in the coastal counties during the rainy season. History The idea to build this dam was conceived in 2009, during the Mwai Kibaki presidency. Following a tendering process, a British entity, GBM Engineering Consortium, based in London, was the only qualifier for the tender. GBM beat six other international construction firms, five of them Chinese. Once initiated, construction is expected to last six years. Ownership The consortium that is developing the dam and power station, will design, fund, build, own, operate and transfer the project, after recovering their investment, during 20 years of ownership, following commercial commissioning.

Roots Van Breda was born on 12 August 1775 in Cape Town. His parents were Pieter van Breda and Catharina Sophia Myburg. He married three times. Out of his marriages with Gesina van Reenen, Beatrix Elizabeth Lategan and Maria Adriana Smalberger he became the father of nine children. He died in Cape Town on 12 August 1847. Merino sheep farming In 1817 van Breda was farming on Zoetendals Vallei farm in the region which is today called Overberg. He imported the Rambouillet Merino from France. Together with the Merino's from Saxony in Germany, which he also imported, he created the South African Merino. He was the first person to start breeding with Merinos in South Africa. His partner was F. W. Reitz. A Merino is a sheep primarily breed for its wool. It is originally from Spain. The first Merinos date back to the 12th century. The sheep is particularly well adapted to low rainfall environments climates. Bredasdorp Van Breda and P.V. van der Byl wanted to build a church for the farming community in the Overberg, part of the Cape Province. They could not agree on a location, so both build a church, 15 kilometres apart. Two towns were founded this way. Today one is called Bredasdorp and the other Napier. Van Breda's church was built on the farm Langefontein in 1838. When a town started to develop around the church it was called Bredasdorp, a name derived from Michiel van Breda's last name.

IBM introduced the Quantum Volume metric because a classical computer‚Äôs transistor count and a quantum computer‚Äôs quantum bit count aren‚Äôt the same. Qubits decohere with a resulting loss of performance so a few fault tolerant bits are more valuable as a performance measure than a larger number of noisy, error-prone qubits.

At the first Ravensbr√ºck trial, beginning in 1946, he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. He was released in 1955 with funds to re- establish a dental practice. Details of his later life are unknown. Early life Martin Hellinger was born on 17 July 1904. Career Women prisoners at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp SS accommodation at Ravensbr√ºck Hellinger joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1933. He served at Sachsenhausen in 1941 and Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp between 1941 and 1942. From spring of 1943 to 1944, he was at Ravensbr√ºck when he was promoted to Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. Orders to gather irreparable gold teeth from living people and extract the gold from the mouths of corpses were given by the SS Reichsf√ºrher Heinrich Himmler, on 23 September 1940. Just short of two years later, the collection of gold became enforced and systematic, as a consequence of the organisation of the Final Solution. Should the victim's family have requested the gold, the Reich's security service advised a reply as follows: > ..... died in this camp, the corpse has been cremated on the....., which > makes it impossible for us to send you back the dental gold. Hellinger was assigned to Ravensbr√ºck, the camp for women, in 1943. He was one of four camp dentists along with Walter Sonntag. The chief camp doctor was Karl Gebhardt. Dental provision at the camp was almost non-existent. Hellinger paid little attention to dental treatment and greater consideration of his role as an executive SS officer performing general duties alongside the other camp office members. Without attempting to prevent it, in one evening he presided over the execution of over fifty women who did not have any trial. His foremost duty was to remove and collect silver and gold teeth and fillings and tooth bridges to send on to Walther Funk, the President of the Reichsbank. After a medical officer had confirmed death and before any unauthorised removals could occur, Hellinger searched the mouths of the dead for gold. He was present at the executions of three British Special Operations Executive agents, Lilian Rolfe, Denise Bloch and Violette Szabo. The Ravensbr√ºck trial alt= The first Ravensbr√ºck trial opened on 3 December 1946, six days before the Nazi doctors' trial in Nuremberg was opened by the United States. Sixteen members of the staff at Ravensbr√ºck were tried by a mixed inter-allied court in the British zone between 5 December 1946 and 3 February 1947. All were found guilty, except one who died during the trial.\\"Ravenbruck accused all found guilty\\", The Advocate Newspaper, 4 February1947. Eleven were sentenced to death. On arrival at the camp, Hellinger checked victim's teeth for gold that he could retrieve later. In a pre-trial statement, Hellinger acknowledged that his duty was to remove gold teeth from dead bodies. This, he did either by himself or delegated to one of the prisoner assistants. In addition, he would extract gold teeth from ‚Äújust-executed prisoners‚Äù, having waited for them in the crematorium prior to the mass cremations. He claimed that he believed that the dead were legally executed.\\"Saved Gold Teeth of Nazi Victims\\", Maryborough Chronicle, 25 January 1946, p. 1. On 3 February 1947, a British military tribunal in Hamburg sentenced him to 15 years in prison. He was not of the opinion that he neglected his professional duties. Later life The Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949, resulting in relaxed restrictions on the German courts. Further removal of restrictions occurred with the \\"Treaty of Transferral\\" between Germany and the United States, the UK and France on 5 May 1955. Hellinger was released from the British prison for war criminals in Werl on 14 May 1955 and re-established his dental practice with a special grant of 10,000 DM. He practiced for many years after.

It was founded by Frederick Hastings Rindge (1857‚Äì1905) and operated on his 13,000-acre ranch along the coast, which encompassed most of what is today Malibu. He struggled for years to keep trespassers off of his land, and feared that the Southern Pacific Company would use the power of eminent domain to build a railroad through his property. This threat animated Rindge to plan his own railroad to thwart the efforts of the Southern Pacific. This was part of his overall effort to keep outsiders off of his ranch and spoil what he considered to be paradise.Myrick, David F. ‚ÄúThe Determined Mrs. Rindge and her Legendary Railroad: A History of the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway,‚Äù The Ventura County Historical Society Quarterly, pp. 12-13, Vol. 41, No. 3, Spring 1996, Ventura County Historical Society, Ventura, California.‚ÄùCoast Trolley to the North,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 13, Los Angeles, California, October 7, 1905.Doyle, Thomas W. and Rindge, Ronald L.

Background Frederick Rindge could trace his ancestry back to Daniel Rindge in Puritan Massachusetts in the 17th century. The Rindge family had done well, and when Frederick's father died in 1883 and his mother two years later, Frederick was the sole heir to a Boston textile manufacturing and real estate fortune variously estimated at $140‚Äì700 million in today's dollars (2018).Randall, David K.

Moses Sherman was a land developer who built the Phoenix Street Railway in Phoenix, Arizona and streetcar systems that would become the core of the Los Angeles Railway and part of the Pacific Electric Railway in Los Angeles. He was potentially interested in extending his rail lines through the Rindge ranch. However, in spite of this, or perhaps because of it, Rindge included him as one of the incorporators of the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway. Rindge probably valued his expertise and figured that the real threat to his ranch would be from a large railroad such as the Southern Pacific, rather than from a local streetcar network such as Sherman's. Sherman's business partner and brother-in-law, Eli P. Clark, was one of the early landowners in the Big Rock Drive area (which is just east of the Rindge ranch), along with newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst. Frederick Rindge and his wife, Rhoda May Knight (1864‚Äì1941), came to Los Angeles in 1887, when it was still a frontier. There he was successful in various business ventures, including founding the Conservative Life Insurance Company and the Los Angeles Edison Electric Company.Myrick, David F. ‚ÄúThe Determined Mrs. Rindge and her Legendary Railroad: A History of the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway,‚Äù The Ventura County Historical Society Quarterly, p. 12, Vol. 41, No. 3, Spring 1996, Ventura County Historical Society, Ventura, California. Rindge became one of the wealthiest men in the state. In 1892, the Rindges purchased the 13,000-acre Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit from Henry Keller. The price was about $10 an acre for the Malibu ranch which was a little over a mile wide and extended along the coast for about 20 miles from Las Flores Canyon westward to the Ventura County Line.Randall, David K.

Malibu: A Good Way of Life, p. 35, Ocean Park Press, Santa Monica, California, 2013. Rindge was a very religious man and saw God's hand in the wild beauty of his ranch. Rindge wrote about his attachment to the land in his book Happy Days in Southern California: ‚ÄúI have grown to love this land. When we moved from the city to the country, it seemed like returning from folly to truth.‚ÄùRindge, Frederick Hastings. Happy Days in Southern California, p. 65, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Los Angeles, California, 1898. The ranch produced barley and beans on the few relatively level areas of the mountainous property, and cattle and sheep were grazed in the canyons. Rindge had ongoing problems with trespassers. He put up locked gates, but the locks were repeatedly cut and the gates destroyed. He also wound up in court, fighting claims from those who had been trespassing for years and claimed the right to continue to do so.Randall, David K. The King and Queen of Malibu: The True Story of the Battle for Paradise, pp. 94-106, 166-7, W. W. Norton & Company, New York, London, 2016. In 1903, a brush fire burned to the ground the large Victorian mansion in Malibu Canyon that the Rindges had built. The wildfire consumed their collection of antiques and family photographs, as well as other valuables. May Rindge felt that the brush fire had been caused by trespassers and their campfires. Frederick feared losing his paradise.Randall, David K. The King and Queen of Malibu: The True Story of the Battle for Paradise, p. 127-9, 145, W. W. Norton & Company, New York, London, 2016. Rindge family home in Los Angeles still stands. Located at 2263 South Harvard Boulevard, the stately house has been used in a number of movies. Railroad Construction Another threat was the tempting sea-level route that the Rindge ranch offered for the construction of a railroad from Los Angeles northward to San Francisco. A water-level route would have saved the Southern Pacific from having to use helper engines to shove its trains up the stiff grades of its inland routes through Saugus and the Santa Susana Pass.Myrick, David F. ‚ÄúThe Determined Mrs. Rindge and her Legendary Railroad: A History of the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway,‚Äù The Ventura County Historical Society Quarterly, p. 9, Vol. 41, No. 3, Spring 1996, Ventura County Historical Society, Ventura, California.‚ÄùAre Trying to Get Malibu Line,‚Äù Oxnard Courier, p. 12, Oxnard, California, December 3, 1909. Train employing helper engines on both front and rear. Prior to 1920, the Interstate Commerce Commission did not have jurisdiction over railroad construction, but Rindge calculated that if he built his own railroad through his ranch on the narrow, level strip of land between the sea and the mountains, the courts would not grant eminent domain to a competing railroad wanting to build a parallel line.Myrick, David F. ‚ÄúThe Determined Mrs. Rindge and her Legendary Railroad: A History of the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway,‚Äù The Ventura County Historical Society Quarterly, p. 13, Vol. 41, No. 3, Spring 1996, Ventura County Historical Society, Ventura, California.Randall, David K.

Thus, he incorporated the Hueneme, Malibu & Port Los Angeles Railway in 1903, with he and his wife being the major stockholders. Frederick Rindge died in August 1905. It is said that his widow, May K. Rindge, had promised him on his deathbed to preserve the beauty of their ‚ÄúSunset-Land‚Äù ranch and resist all efforts by others to invade their domain. She spent the next 30 years doing everything she could to fulfill this promise. It fell to her to build the railroad that they had planned. She became the president of their railroad, and expended every effort to keep the Southern Pacific out of their ranch. She was the first woman ever to head a railroad in California, and the only one in the country at large.Myrick, David F. ‚ÄúThe Determined Mrs. Rindge and her Legendary Railroad: A History of the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway,‚Äù The Ventura County Historical Society Quarterly, pp. 3, 14, Vol. 41, No. 3, Spring 1996, Ventura County Historical Society, Ventura, California.Randall, David K.

On the trestle is the small engine that the Rindge railroad purchased in 1908. The Rindge railroad route generally hugged the coast, often just above the high-tide line. However, due to the steep cliffs right at the water's edge at Point Dume, the railroad turned inland at Paradise Cove, climbed over the bluffs, and then came back down to the beach just past the tip of Point Dume.Doyle, Thomas W. and Rindge, Ronald L. Malibu Rails and Roads, pp. 22-9, 32-6, Malibu Adamson House Foundation, Malibu, California, 2012. Surveys were run to connect the railroad with the Southern Pacific line at its Long Wharf at Port Los Angeles, which was at the location of the current Will Rogers State Beach lifeguard headquarters at 15100 W Pacific Coast Highway, Pacific Palisades, California. Surveys were also run to connect with the Bakersfield & Ventura Railway near Hueneme, California. However, this would have meant extending the line several miles outside the boundaries of the Rindge ranch on either end. This entailed negotiating with other landowners, some of whom were less than enthusiastic about the project. To further complicate matters, the Southern Pacific already had a right to the portion of the right-of-way that crossed the Marquez Ranch, which was between Temescal and Topanga Canyons. The Southern Pacific Long Wharf (Port Los Angeles), ca. 1900. When it opened in 1894, it was the longest wharf in the world, measuring approximately 4,700 feet. Santa Monica Canyon is at right, and Malibu is in the background. Rather than wait for this to be resolved, construction was begun on Rindge ranch property in September 1905. Renewed activity took place in the spring of 1906. Crossties and rails arrived at San Pedro docks, and were transloaded to barges, which tugs towed to the new 600-foot pier that had been constructed at Keller's Shelter on the Rindge ranch. By October, five miles of track had been laid westward from Carbon Canyon (near the eastern boundary of the ranch), and work was suspended for the season.‚ÄùOn the Malibu Railroad,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 22, Los Angeles, California, October 2, 1905.Ties, rails and other materials were unloaded at the Rindge pier (now known as Malibu Pier) at Keller's Shelter. Later, in 1908, the railroad construction contractor experimented with unloading ties directly into the ocean and letting them drift to the construction site, which apparently worked successfully.Myrick, David F. ‚ÄúThe Determined Mrs. Rindge and her Legendary Railroad: A History of the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway,‚Äù The Ventura County Historical Society Quarterly, p. 28, Vol. 41, No. 3, Spring 1996, Ventura County Historical Society, Ventura, California. The law at the time required that five miles of railroad be constructed each year or the company would have to forfeit the right to continue building. In 1907, Mrs. Rindge let a contract for another five miles of railroad to be built. This track, approaching Point Dume, was completed by October. In 1908, the railroad acquired its only rolling stock, a small, 15-horsepower, gasoline-powered engine made by H. P. Fellows, and two flat cars. This equipment speeded track construction and assisted in building the railroad's two large trestles, one that was 40‚Äì50 feet high spanning Ramirez Creek and the other spanning Walnut Creek on Point Dume. By October 1908, the railroad was 15 miles long and reached a point 1,400 feet past Encinal Canyon, about four miles from the county line.‚ÄùRushing the Malibu Road,‚Äù Oxnard Courier, p. 1, Oxnard, California, May 10, 1907.‚ÄùTurn Eyes up Coast,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 14, Los Angeles, California, May 18, 1907.‚ÄùRush of the Graders,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 28, Los Angeles, California, May 22, 1907.‚ÄùPushing Malibu Road,‚Äù San Bernardino County Sun, p. 10, San Bernardino, California, September 7, 1907.‚ÄùSurveyors Working on Broom Ranch,‚Äù Oxnard Courier, p. 5, Oxnard, California, November 1, 1907.‚ÄùActivity in the Canyons,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 26, Los Angeles, California, November 3, 1907.‚ÄùBuild More Railroad,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 24, Los Angeles, California, May 19, 1908.‚ÄùStarting Five Miles More,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 13, Los Angeles, California, June 14, 1908.‚ÄùThe Road of Mystery,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 16, Los Angeles, California, June 15, 1908.‚ÄùNew Franchise Needed?‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 24, Los Angeles, California, June 18, 1908.‚ÄùLittle Motor Does Wonders,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 14, Los Angeles, California, July 27, 1908.‚ÄùDirect Power Transmission,‚Äù Santa Ana Register, p. 8, Santa Ana, California, July 28, 1908.‚ÄùLaying Steel on Malibu Road,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, p. 2, Los Angeles, California, August 11, 1908.‚ÄùMalibu Ranch Railroad,‚Äù San Bernardino County Sun, p. 7, San Bernardino, California, August 14, 1908.Doyle, Thomas W. and Rindge, Ronald L.

It was the native deme of Strepsiades, the protagonist in Aristophanes' The Clouds. Representing the generality of the deme, Aristophanes depicts this character as a prosperous farmer and attentive to his lazy son. Probably Cicynna had his own diasia, the most important festival to Zeus in Attica, in which the god was honored as Zeus Meilichius: this is evident from a passage from the aforementioned comedy by Aristophanes. The party was held on the 23rd of Anthesterion (around the beginning of March); the richest people offered sacrifices, and the poorest burned incense. Its site is tentatively located near modern Chalidou.

There may also be a palisade along the top of the bank. Linear earthworks may have a ditch alongside which provides the source of earth for the bank and an extra obstacle. There may be a single ditch, a ditch on both sides or no ditch at all. Earthworks range in length from a few tens of metres to more than 80 km. Linear earthworks are also known as dykes (also spelt dike), or \\"ranch boundaries\\".  Functions  Linear earthworks may function as defences, as boundary markers to define a territory, to mark out agricultural land, to control movement of people or animals, to levy customs duties or as a combination of some or all of these. A cross dyke is a type of linear earthwork believed to be a prehistoric land boundary.  Date and distribution  Linear earthworks are found around the world. The earliest dated linear earthwork in the United Kingdom dates to around 3600 BC near Hambleton Hill in Dorset. The Scots' Dike was built in 1552 to mark the border between England and Scotland.  Examples  In Ireland, the Black Pig's Dyke is an example of an Iron Age linear earthwork. In the United Kingdom, Offa‚Äôs Dyke, Wat's Dyke and the Wansdyke are examples of early medieval linear earthworks, while the Antonine Wall is a Roman example. In Africa, the Walls of Benin and Sungbo's Eredo (both in Nigeria) are also examples of linear earthworks; in China some parts of the fortifications that make up the Great Wall are built of earth. Danevirke in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany and the G√∂tavirke in Sweden are early medieval linear earthworks while the Silesian Walls in Poland and Scots' Dike were built in the later medieval period.

He served an 11-month sentence. 13 employees of Cumhuriyet were convicted on April 23, 2018, and they face up to 43 years in prison. The Vienna-based International Press Institute reacted by calling for G√ºrsel and other journalists to be released as soon as possible. = Release = An Istanbul court ordered the release of G√ºrsel on September 25, 2017. On this day, 200 people gathered outside Istanbul's Cagalyan Courthouse carrying portraits of the jailed journalist and banners with slogans. Some included \\"Freedom for Journalists\\" and \\"Independent press cannot be silenced.\\" On September 26, 2017 G√ºrsel was finally released from prison before the trial. A photo of him reuniting with his wife went viral, which showed the couple kissing after being apart for 11 months. The trial began in July 2017 but was adjourned until October 31, 2017. = Post-release = Upon his release, G√ºrsel stated that ‚Äúeach hearing of the Cumhuriyet case was historic because it showed how journalism could be defended and how empty the accusations were.‚Äù The detainment of G√ºrsel and his colleagues caused outrage amongst the public. On October 28, 2017 (a month after G√ºrsel's release), 200 people marched in Istanbul against the imprisonment of journalists. After a 30-minute march journalist, Gulsah Karadag, stated: > We are here side by side. Every step that we take is for our friends who are > in jail due to their opinions, supporting their patience and their will. > None of us can be free as long as dozens of journalists are jailed. The > jailing of journalists conceals the truth and prevents lies from being > revealed. It tramples rights, law and justice. On September 11, 2018, G√ºrsel resigned from Cumhuriyet after the Cumhuriyet Foundation, the owner of the newspaper, elected a new board of the newspaper and assigned Alev Co≈ükun, who was a state witness against the Cumhuriyet journalists, as the head of the board. On January 8, 2019, G√ºrsel started a political commentary show on Medyascope, a Turkish political news network on YouTube.https://medyascope.tv/2019/01/08/yorum-kadri-gursel-1-firatin-dogusu- icin-abdyle-pazarlik-ankaranin-plani-ne-kadar-gercekci/  References  Category:Turkish journalists Category:Cumhuriyet people Category:1961 births Category:2016‚Äì17 purges in Turkey Category:Human rights abuses in Turkey Category:Living people Category:Journalists imprisoned in Turkey ","title":"Kadri G√ºrsel"},{"id":"58716995","text":"The 2018‚Äì19 season was Lille OSC's 75th season in existence and the club's 19th consecutive season in the top flight of French football.

Life Hans Hahne was born the son of a sugar manufacturer. He attended school in Artern and after 1885 in Berlin and Magdeburg, where he graduated in 1894 from the Domgymnasium. At the Universities of Jena, Munich, and Leipzig, he studied natural sciences and medicine and received his MD in 1899. This was followed by specialist training in Bern, Berlin, and Leipzig. In 1902 Hahne settled in Magdeburg as an internist and neurologist, but closed his practice in 1905 to devote himself to prehistory and early history . In the years 1905-1907 Hahne studied prehistory under Gustaf Kossinna at the University of Berlin. From 1907 he became assistant at the Lower Saxony State Museum in Hannover, where he was appointed assistant director in 1908. At the same time he was an adjunct professor at the Leibniz University Hannover. In 1912 Hahne was appointed director of the Halle State Museum of Prehistory. In World War I he was exempted from military service due to a heart and liver disease. At the University of Halle, he received his doctorate in February 1918 with his thesis \\"Die geologische Lagerung der Moorleichen und Moorbr√ºcken als Beitrag zur Forschung der erdgeschichtlichen Vorg√§nge der Nacheiszeit \\" (\\"The geological stratification of bog bodies and bog villages as a contribution to the research of geological processes of the post-glacial period\\"). He was appointed professor in May and habilitated in November 1918 at the University of Hannover in prehistory (Prehistoric Archeology). In 1921 Hahne was appointed associate professor, in November 1933 full professor; shortly afterwards he was appointed rector of the University of Halle. As a \\"Volkish\\" scientist, he also incorporated anthroposophical influences into his theories.Peter Staudenmaier: Der deutsche Geist am Scheideweg: Anthroposophen in Auseinandersetzung mit v√∂lkischer Bewegung und Nationalsozialismus.

Before 1933 Hahne joined the National Socialist Party and was Deputy District Culture Warden (Gaukulturwart), Director of Training in Racial Science (Rassenkunde) in Gau Mitteldeutschland (Saxony) of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt). In February 1934, Hahne suffered a severe stroke with paralysis on his left side, which hindered him so much that he had to turn over most of his duties to colleagues. Hans Hahne died on 2 February 1935 in Halle. Hahne's research interests were bog archeology and bog bodies, such as the \\"Bernuthsfeld Man\\".

Her death prompted a debate over whether prosecuting people accused of making a false accusation of rape could deter rape victims from reporting the crime, as well as whether it was appropriate to prosecute vulnerable individuals (de Freitas had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression and was judged by a psychiatrist to represent a suicide risk). The decision to prosecute de Freitas was ultimately upheld by both the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General for England and Wales, while the Metropolitan Police Service paid compensation to the accused man, albeit without admitting liability. From a legal perspective, the case was notable due to the use of a private prosecution and the first successful employment of a public interest defence to a charge of defamation.  Timeline of events  = Background = Eleanor Poppy Miranda de Freitas was born on 26 June 1990 and grew up in Fulham, London. She attended the independent Putney High School, achieving straight As in her A Level exams. In 2008 she enrolled in Grey College, Durham University to study geography. During her first year, she suffered a mental breakdown. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression and began seeing a psychiatrist, who prescribed her antidepressants. At the end of the 2008/09 academic year, de Freitas dropped out of Durham University. In February 2012, de Freitas had another mental breakdown. She accused her parents of trying to poison her and her landlord of sexually assaulting her; went on unaffordable shopping sprees; and became delusional. She was involuntarily committed under the Mental Health Act 1983 and spent a month in Ealing Hospital, where she was reportedly mentally and physically abused. After successfully challenging her detention at a Mental Health Review Tribunal and being released, de Freitas began living alone with support from her parents and working part-time in a branch of The Body Shop on King's Road in Chelsea. Unbeknown to her parents, she reportedly also worked as a tantric masseuse and escort. In summer 2013, she began training as an accountant. = Rape allegations = In 2008 or 2009, de Freitas met Alexander Economou, the sometime company secretary of his family-run shipping agency. They became acquaintances after attending the same party in Chelsea in October 2012. On 23 December 2012, de Freitas and Economou met alone for the first and only time and had sex. On 4 January 2013, de Freitas alleged to the Metropolitan Police Service that Economou had raped her. In an interview with police, she asserted that she \\"wasn't in control of my body\\" due to combining alcohol with her bipolar medicine and was unable to consent; that Economou had \\"drugged\\" her; that she had been \\"frozen with fear\\"; and that Economou had coerced her into allowing him to tie her up, \\"waterboard\\" her, and have unprotected sex with her. Economou was arrested and spent a night in custody. On 20 February 2013, the Police decided to take no further action against Economou; he was never charged. Economou asserted that the sex had been consensual; that he had ended the relationship on 24 December 2012 after discovering de Freitas was working as a tantric masseuse and after receiving \\"crazy\\" text messages from de Freitas; and that de Freitas had fabricated the rape claim \\"as an act of revenge, because I rejected her\\". = Prosecution = In August 2013, Economou launched a private prosecution of de Freitas for perverting the course of justice at a cost of approximately ¬£200,000. Economou amassed witness statements, text messages and closed-circuit television footage that he contended contradicted the account of de Freitas, including footage of de Freitas and himself shopping together for sex toys at an Ann Summers shop on the day following the alleged rape and text messages de Freitas had sent to mutual friends. Upon receiving the summons on 13 August 2013, de Freitas reportedly had a panic attack. She engaged a defence solicitor who invited Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Crown Prosecution Service, to use his statutory power to take over the private prosecution and end it. However, in December 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service instead announced that it would instead take over and continue the prosecution. De Freitas subsequently enquired of the ability to seek an injunction against reporting on the prosecution. The Metropolitan Police Service officers who had investigated the alleged rape refused to support the Crown Prosecution Service but were overruled. De Freitas was arraigned at Southwark Crown Court on 24 January 2014, pleading not guilty. Rape counselling services were withdrawn from de Freitas upon the commencement of the prosecution (in March 2015, Member of Parliament Valerie Vaz asked Solicitor General for England and Wales Robert Buckland to \\"review the guidance to ensure that the provision of support and counselling services to vulnerable people is not removed abruptly\\"). De Freitas became \\"severely\\" depressed and her behaviour became erratic, including claiming she was being followed and that her phone was being tapped and wearing a burqa when going out in public. In September 2013, she was found in a branch of Co-op Food on Strand throwing crisp packets and shouting at staff. A psychiatric report prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service stated that de Freitas was fit to stand trial but required constant evaluation as she posed a \\"chronic and significant\\" suicide risk. Her doctor did not prescribe lithium for her bipolar disorder as de Freitas suffered from a fear of needles. = Suicide = On 4 April 2014, de Freitas committed suicide by hanging herself at her family home in Fulham, London. Her trial for perverting the course of justice had been due to commence on 7 April. She left a suicide note in which she stated, \\"If I were to lose the case I know that I would have brought huge shame on the family. It's entirely my fault for what has happened and there are many other events which make me make this decision.\\" She also expressed fears about potentially having to testify in court in her defence. De Freitas had previously expressed fears about being involuntarily committed once again. At an inquest held in March 2015, coroner Chinyere Inyama recorded a verdict of suicide and noted that the impending trial had been a \\"significant stressor\\" on de Freitas. A call by solicitor Harriet Wistrich on behalf of de Freitas' family to widen the scope of the inquest to assess whether the Crown Prosecution Service had breached the right to life enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998 by prosecuting de Freitas was unsuccessful. The call for a special inquest was supported by Emily Thornberry, the then-Shadow Attorney General for England and Wales. = Reaction = Following de Freitas' suicide, her father David criticised the decision to prosecute her, stating, \\"We can see no reason whatsoever why the CPS pursued Eleanor. If the CPS had put a stop to it at the time I would still have a daughter.\\" David de Freitas suggested that de Freitas had feared once again being involuntarily committed and was embarrassed that \\"extraneous evidence\\" would emerge during the trial alleging work in the sex industry. De Freitas had been concerned about having to testify in her defence in court; delays by the Crown Prosecution Service in providing a record of her interview with police to her defence solicitor meant they were unable to confirm that she would not be required to testify until the morning of her death (a court order requiring the Crown Prosecution Service to disclose all evidence at least six weeks prior to the trial was not complied with). The Crown Prosecution Service later apologised for the delay in the disclosure of the evidence. The decision to prosecute de Freitas was also criticised by the organisation Women Against Rape, which argued that the \\"aggressive pursuit\\" of women accused of making false allegations of rape in the United Kingdom was deterring rape victims from reporting the crime to the police. The charity Victim Support released a statement expressing concerns about the use of private prosecutions to \\"intimidate\\" people making allegations of rape, while the charity Justice for Women stated \\"the public interest is always overwhelmingly in favour of not prosecuting a rape complainant\\" and \\"it is imperative that the overwhelming public interest in improving the UK's appallingly low conviction rate for rape offences is considered by all prosecutors when deciding whether to charge women for perverting the course of justice\\". Lisa Avalos of the University of Arkansas stated that the United Kingdom makes significantly more prosecutions for false rape allegations than the United States, and that these carry a charge of perverting the course of justice (with a maximum sentence of life in prison) rather than false reporting (which carries lighter penalties such as community service, fines, or probation). The charity Inquest cited statistics showing \\"no country pursues the prosecution of disbelieved rape complainants with the frequency that occurs in Britain\\". An alternative view was expressed by journalist Radhika Sanghani, who wrote that \\"false rape allegations can have devastating consequences for the accused\\" and noted that over a 17 month period in 2011 to 2012 there were only 35 prosecutions for false rape allegations in England and Wales, compared to 5,651 prosecutions for rape. Sarah Green of the End Violence Against Women Coalition opinioned, \\"We must prosecute these cases if someone's trying to maliciously get someone into trouble.\\" In the 2019 publication Personal Participation in Criminal Proceedings, Kate Leader wrote that the case \\"has drawn attention to the issues that can arise from private prosecutions\\". In mid-2020, the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Justice Select Committee made a call for evidence on an inquiry into the use of private prosecutions. The Centre for Women's Justice provided written evidence to the inquiry in which it stated \\"Eleanor, for example, was never interviewed as a suspect; she sat in the dock without having ever been arrested, or her rights explained to her as a defendant, and without having had the opportunity to respond to the allegations against her.\\" = Subsequent legal proceedings = The suicide prompted Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders to review the decision to prosecute. In December 2014, Saunders concluded that it had been correct to do so, stating that there was \\"sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction\\" and \\"a strong public interest in prosecuting\\". Saunders also stated that medical experts had advised that de Freitas was fit to stand trial. After de Freitas' father David called for a new inquiry or a review to be carried out, in June 2018, Attorney General for England and Wales Jeremy Wright decided not to order an independent inquiry into the decision to prosecute, stating, \\"I have carefully considered the concerns raised by Mr de Freitas and I am satisfied that this case has already been subject to extensive scrutiny within the CPS, and that it was right for the prosecution to go ahead.\\" In December 2014, Alexander Economou began a libel claim against David de Freitas, asserting that articles critical of the Crown Prosecution Service appearing in The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian and an interview with John Humphrys on the Today programme broadcast on BBC Radio 4 had resulted in his enduring \\"public rubbishing\\" and damaged his reputation. The claim was dismissed in July 2016 with the judge ruling that, while Economou's reputation had been damaged, this was justified given de Freitas had considered the articles and broadcast to be in the public interest and that ruling in favour of Economou would represent a disproportionate infringement upon de Freitas' freedom of speech. The judge stated 'When a person suffering from mental ill-health kills herself at a time when she is facing public prosecution for making a false allegation of rape there is a clear public interest in considering whether there is a causal link and, if so, whether the decision-making was at fault and there are lessons to be learned.' This represented the first time a public interest defence had been successfully mounted under the Defamation Act 2013. An appeal by Economou against the ruling was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in November 2018. Economou subsequently sought permission to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which was refused. Whilst David de Freitas's public interest defence was not directly challenged in the Supreme Court, it was examined at some length in the defamation appeal in Serafin v Malkiewicz and others. Lord Wilson, delivering the unanimous judgement of the five-member panel, dismissed this criticism with the words \\"I can discern no basis for that criticism\\". The BBC issued a retraction and apology in May 2015 after Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape indirectly referred to Economou as a \\"rapist\\" while being interviewed on a live episode of Victoria Derbyshire. In December 2015, Economou was charged with harassing David de Freitas. It was alleged that Economou had sent letters and emails to de Freitas and his solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, and \\"uploaded various recordings and comments onto websites\\". Economou was found not guilty in June 2016, with the judge stating, \\"I find that the defendant's actions were calculated to counter the continuing incorrect assertions that the allegation of rape was true\\". In November 2018, Economou received ¬£10,000 of compensation from the Metropolitan Police Service, albeit without admitting liability, in connection with their investigation of the initial complaint made by de Freitas.

Aphrodisias temple The Sanctuary of Aphrodite of Aphrodisias was a sanctuary in ancient Aphrodisias dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite.Lisa R. Brody, The Cult of Aphrodite at Aphrodisias in Caria, 2001 History The site was a local cult center centered around a local fertility goddess since at least the 7th century BC. In the hellenistic period, the local goddess came to be identified with the Greek goddess Aphrodite, in a similar manner as the Artemis of Ephesus was originally a local goddess who came to be identified with Artemis, and the city became a pilgrimage for people from across Anatolia and the Aegean sea. Structure The first sanctuary is dated to the late 7th-century or early 6th-century BC. A new and more monumental temple was erected in the 1st century BC during the Hellenistic period and financed by the wealthy freedman Zolios. The sanctuary was granted the status of asylum by the senatus consultuni de Aphrodisiensibus of 39 BC. The temple formed the center of the city and was the center of the city's prosperity. The Temple of Aphrodite was a focal point of the town. The Aphrodisian sculptors became renowned and benefited from a plentiful supply of marble close at hand. The school of sculpture was very productive;Kenan T. Erim, \\"The school of Aphrodisias, \\" Archaeology 20.1:18-27. much of their work can be seen around the site and in the museum. Dissolution The character of the temple building was altered when it became a Christian basilica. The building is believed to have been dismantled in c. 481-484 by order of Emperor Zeno, because the temple had been the focus of Pagan Hellenic opposition against Zeno in Aphrodisias, in support of Illus, who had promised to restore Hellenic rites, which had been suppressed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, to the temples that where still standing.Trombley, Hellenic Religion and Christianization c. 370-529 References Category:Temples of Aphrodite Category:Conversion of non-Christian religious buildings and structures into churches Category:1st-century BC religious buildings and structures Category:Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire Category:Aphrodisias ","title":"Sanctuary of Aphrodite Aphrodisias"},{"id":"58717043","text":"Abdolrasool Vatandoust Haghighi () was born in Isfahan, Iran, on July 17, 1947. Being originally from Shiraz, he lived in Tehran from his childhood. Vatandoust completed his high school (Oloom High School, Tehran) in 1965 and on the same year and after passing the universities entrance examination was admitted to the Faculty of Science, University of Tehran.  Education  After receiving his BSc degree in Chemistry in 1969 and completing his mandatory military service he joined the then Archaeological Centre of Iran to help, with collaboration of others, with establishing the first conservation and restoration laboratory there.  Career  After returning to Iran, Vatandoust continued his career in the Archaeological Centre of Iran and further developed, with the help and cooperation of his colleagues, the conservation laboratory (Currently this laboratory which is located in the basement of the Research Centre for Archaeology, is part of the National Museum of Iran Conservation Laboratory). In 1987 he submitted a proposal to the then Iranian Cultural Heritage Organisation for the creation of the Central Research Laboratory for the Conservation of Cultural Properties, and upon receiving the Organisation's agreement he began the project. It was soon completed and opened. Simultaneously he succeeded in securing the approval for the construction of a building to house the laboratory. The building was constructed on a piece of land in front of National Museum of Iran. In December 2005 the building was officially opened and housed the Research Centre for the Conservation of Cultural Relics (RCCCR), an institution he had established after creation of the Central Laboratory for Conservation. Management of the Bureau for International Relations was among his other responsibilities in the cultural heritage section of the country. Vatandoust was retired from the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organisation of Iran in 2009. in the 41st session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, Krakow, 2017  Academic activities  Vatandoust came to Iran in 1975 to cooperate in establishing an academic course on the restoration of cultural properties in Pardis-e Isfahan, affiliated to Farabi University. Accordingly, he began his teaching career at this college from 1975 alongside scholars such as Mohammad Karim Pirnia and Jamshid Behnam.

It was the main temple of Aphrodite in Corinth, and famous for its alleged temple prostitution. History The goddess Aphrodite was the protector deity of the city of Corinth. She had at least three sanctuaries in the city; the temple of Aphrodite at the Acrocorinth, the temple of Aphrodite II, and the Temple of Aphrodite Kraneion, as well as one temple at Leachaion and one at Cenchreae. It was however the Aphrodite temple of Acrocorinth that was the most famous one. The temple was constructed in the 5th-century BC. It was situated at the top peak of the Acrocorinth. According to the myth, the Acrocorinth had been given to Aphrodite by Poseidon. It was a small building, 10 by 16 metres (33' x 52'). It contained a famous statue of Armed Aphrodite, dressed in armour and holding a shield before herself as a mirror. Temple of Aphrodite at Acrocorinth is above all famous for the claims of the temple prostitution of courtesans, which were said to be dedicated to the service of the temple, and contributed to the attraction of visitors to the city of Corinth. The alleged temple prostitution is famous by the descriptions made by Strabo: :\\"The temple of Aphrodite [in Korinthos in the days of the tyrant Kypselos] was so rich that it owned more than a thousand temple slaves, courtesans, whom both men and women had dedicated to the goddess. And therefore it was also on account of these women that the city was crowded with people and grew rich; for instance, the ship captains freely squandered their money, and hence the proverb, ‚ÄòNot for every man is the voyage to Korinthos.‚Äô . . . Now the summit [of the Akrokorinthos] has a small temple of Aphrodite; and below the summit is the spring Peirene . . . At any rate, Euripides says, ‚ÄòI am come, having left Akrokorinthos that is washed on all sides, the sacred hill-city of Aphrodite.‚Äô\\"Strabo, Geography 8. 6. 20 (trans. Jones) [...] Korinthos, there, on account of the multitude of courtesans, who were sacred to Aphrodite, outsiders resorted in great numbers and kept holiday. And the merchants and soldiers who went there squandered all their money so that the following proverb arose in reference to them: 'Not for every man is the voyage to Korinthos.\\"Strabo, Geography 12. 4. 36 The actual occurrence of temple prostitution at Acrocorinth is however unconfirmed, and there is dispute about the number of prostitutes and about their alleged connection to the temple of Aphrodite. The later history of the temple is not clearly established. In 146 BC, the city of Ancient Corinth was destroyed, and many of the sanctuaries atop the Acrocorinth was, if not destroyed, so deserted. When the city of Roman Corinth was established in 44 BC, many of the former sanctuaries were rebuilt, such as the Temple of Apollo and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on Acrocorinth. It appears that the Temple of Aphrodite at Acrocorinth was also rebuilt. It appears on many coins from the Roman era, and Pausanias described the Temple of Aphrodite at Acrocorinth in the 1st century: :\\"On the summit of the Acrocorinthus is a temple of Aphrodite. The images are Aphrodite armed, Helius, and Eros with a bow. The spring, which is behind the temple, they say was the gift of Asopus to Sisyphus.‚ÄùPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 5. 1 The remains of the temple were used as a part of a church in the 5th century.

Located where the legendary birth of Aphrodite took place, it has been referred to as the main sanctuary of Aphrodite, and was a place of pilgrimages in the ancient world for centuries. History The site of Paphos was a holy place for the ancient Greeks, who believed it to be the place where Aphrodite landed when she rose from the sea.Tac. Hist. ii. 3; Mela, ii. 7; Lucan viii.456 According to Pausanias (i. 14), her worship was introduced to Paphos from Syria, and from Paphos to Kythera in Greece. The cult was likely of Phoenician origin. Archaeology has established that Cypriots venerated a fertility goddess before the arrival of the Greeks, and developed a cult that combined Aegean and eastern mainland aspects. Before it was proved by archaeology it was understood that the cult of Aphrodite had been established before the time of Homer (c. 700 BC), as the grove and altar of Aphrodite at Paphos are mentioned in the Odyssey (viii. 362). Female figurines and charms found in the immediate vicinity date to the early third millennium BC. The temenos (a piece of land marked off from common uses and dedicated to a god, a sanctuary, holy grove or holy precinct) was well established before the first structures were erected in the Late Bronze Age. The sanctuary was closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire in the 4th-century, and had at that time been in function for thousands of years since the Late Bronze Age: :\\"There was unbroken continuity of cult from that time until 391 AD when the Roman Emperor Theodosius I outlawed all pagan religions and the sanctuary fell into the ruins in which we find it today.\\" =Cult activity= Sanctuary of Aphrodite Paphia was the center of the worship of the goddess, not for Cyprus alone, but for the whole Aegean world. The Cinyradae, or descendants of Cinyras, of Phoenician origin but Greek by name, were the chief priests. Their power and authority were very great; but it may be inferred from certain inscriptions that they were controlled by a senate and an assembly of the people. There was also an oracle here.Engel, i.p. 483. Few cities have ever been so much sung and glorified by the poets.For example, Aeschylus Suppliants 525; Virgil Aeneid i. 415; Horace Odes i. 19, 30, iii. 26; Status Silvius i. 2. 101; Aristophanes Lysistrata 833, etc. =Architecture= The sanctuary are depicted on many Roman coins from the Roman Imperial period from the reign of Vespasian as well as on earlier and later ones, and especially in the style on those of Septimius Severus.Engel, vol. i. p. 130. The sanctuary was destroyed by an earthquake, but rebuilt by Vespasian. =Archeology= The remains of the vast sanctuary of Aphrodite are still discernible, its circumference marked by huge foundation walls. Gustav Friedrich Hetsch, an architect of Copenhagen, has attempted to restore the building from the descriptions of coins as well as from archeological remains.M√ºller's Arch√§ol. ¬ß 239, p. 261; Eckhel, vol. iii. p. 86. =Contemporary mentions= The sanctuary is frequently referred to by ancient writers. The Homeric Hymns written between 7th-4th centuries B.C. and spuriously ascribed to Homer in antiquity mention the sanctuary in Hymn 5 to Aphrodite: :\\"She [Aphrodite] went to Kypros, to Paphos, where her precinct is and fragrant altar, and passed into her sweet- smelling temple.\\"http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AphroditeCult2.html Strabo described it: :\\"Palaipaphos [in Kypros], which last is situated at about ten stadia above the sea, has a mooring-place, and an ancient temple of Aphrodite Paphia. Then [beyond that] to the promontory Zephyria, with a landing-place, and to another Arsinoe, which likewise has a landing-place and a temple and a sacred precinct. And at a little distance from the sea is Hierokepis. Then to Paphos, which was founded by Agapenor, and has both a harbor and well-built temples. It is sixty stadia distant from Palaiphaphos by land; and on this road men together with women, who also assemble here from the other cities, hold an annual procession to Palaipaphos . . . Then [beyond that] to a city Soloi, with a harbor and a river and a temple of Aphrodite and Isis.\\"http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AphroditeCult2.html Pausanias described the shrine: :\\"After the capture of Troy the storm that overtook the Greeks on their return home carried Agapenor and the Arkadian fleet to Kypros, and so Agapenor became the founder of Paphos, and built the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Palaipaphos (Old Paphos). Up to that time the goddess had been worshipped by the Kyprians in the district called Golgoi.\\"http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AphroditeCult2.html Tacitus described the altar and aniconic black stone worshipped at the sanctuary as the simulacrum of Venus: :\\"Blood may not be shed upon the altar, but offering is made only with prayers and pure fire. The altar is never wet by any rain, although it is in the open air. The representation of the goddess is not in human form, but it is a circular mass that is broader at the base and rises like a turning- post to a small circumference at the top. The reason for this is obscure.\\" It was also referred to by Apuleius in The Golden Ass: :\\"You [Aphrodite] are venerated at the wave-lapped shrine of Paphos.\\"http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AphroditeCult2.html References * Richard Maguire, Jane Chick, Approaching Cyprus: Proceedings of the Post-Graduate Conference of Cypriot Category:Temples of Aphrodite Category:Paphos ","title":"Sanctuary of Aphrodite Paphia"},{"id":"58717099","text":"Eitea () was a deme of ancient Attica, of the phyle of Antiochis.

Hon. Sir Alexander Bustamante, one year after the country's independence. From 1963 to 1966, Rt. Hon. Sir Donald Sangster served as Jamaica's governor to the IMF and World Bank, and represented Jamaica during delegations held at the IMF and World Bank's Washington D.C. headquarters. In 1963, the IMF made its first loan to Jamaica ever, in the amount of 10 million SDR's. In 1967, Sir Donald Sangster was elected as Jamaica's second Prime Minister, simultaneously serving as Minister of Finance and Minister of Defense. Moreover, Jamaica played a pivotal role in hosting the 1976 IMF Interim Committee in Jamaica, during the IMF's changing role within the Bretton Woods system that, in 1944, had previously been established after World War II. In a letter to President Ford, William E. Simon highlighted the major revisions of the Bretton Woods system that took effect as a result of the ratification of the Jamaica Accords. The Jamaica Accords focus was to abolishment of the Gold Standard that the Bretton Woods System had previously established. In order to create a more stable international monetary system, the Jamaica Accords served to create a more versatile foreign exchange rate that focused on a floating foreign exchange rate. In addition to the abolishment of the Bretton Woods system, a secondary meeting was held in Jamaica that helped the Development Committee to refocus on developing countries financial problems within the International Monetary System. In conclusion, this meeting established the implementation of expanded access to IMF resources through a Trust Fund in order to create more support for developing countries. IMF SBA's and EFF's with Jamaica Since its membership with the IMF, Jamaica has used the IMF resources consistently, and taken advantage of the availability of loans provided in order to help improve the standard of living, and economic stability of the country. Jamaica and the IMF have entered into a total of sixteen arrangements. In 1963, the IMF approved the first Stand-By Arrangement with Jamaica. The total amount disbursed by the IMF stand-by arrangement was 10 million SDR's, which Jamaica could use if necessary, however; Jamaica did not use any money provided by the loan, and it expired in 1964. In the following years, Jamaica entered into two additional stand-by arrangements, the first in 1973, and the second in 1977. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Michael Norman Manely, who served two terms as prime minister (1972-1980, and 1989-1992) on a platform of democratic socialism. The stand-by arrangement of 1973 was approved in the amount of 26,000 SDR's, and the second was approved in the amount of 64 million SDR's, of which; Jamaica only withdrew a total of 13.25 million SDR's, and 19.2 million SDR's respectively. In June of the following year (1978), June 1979, and April 1981, Jamaica entered into three separate Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreements, which permitted Jamaica to repay its outstanding loan over a longer period of time due to economic factors that prevented the country from following the originally planned repayment plan. These factors might include balance of payments imbalances due to conflicting structural procedures, or slow economic growth due to internal balance of payments weaknesses. EFF's allow a country to continue developing its internal structural integrity in order to strengthen economic growth without being too burdened by the costs of repayment. In 1984, Jamaica began a new stand-by arrangement under the leadership of The Most Hon. Edward Phillip George Seaga who ran as the leader the Jamaican Labour Party in 1980, and won the seat as Jamaica's Prime Minister.  Current(2018) Relations with IMF  As of 2018, Jamaica is joined in a constituency with Antigua, Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Dominica, Grenada, Ireland, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Together, this IMF constituency has a total of 170,118 Special Drawing Rights (SDR's) votes and the percent total of the constituency fund amounts to 3.38%. This constituency has been headed by Executive Director Louise Levonian from Canada, and Alternate Executive Director Anne Marie McKiernan from Ireland since mid-2018. Jamaica, on the other hand has a total quota of 382.9 million SDR's and has 5,294 total SDR votes equivalent to 0.11% of the total vote. Furthermore, Jamaica has a potential claim, also known as a Special Drawing Rights, of 155.55 million SDR's available for immediate withdrawal without conditionality. Up until December 2018, Jamaica has increased its quota reserves eleven times throughout its membership with the IMF. Jamaica's initial quota was in the amount of US$20,000, which was allocated to the IMF in February 1963. Subsequently, Jamaica has increased its quota shares in 1966 (twice),and again in 1969, 1970, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1992, 1999, and in 2016. As of today, Jamaica has an outstanding (unpaid) loan in the amount of 528.78 million SDR's.

It was the mother of all European weeping beeches in the United States. The Weeping Beech was imported by horticulturalist Samuel Parsons in 1846 and planted in 1847. It was designated a living New York City Landmark in 1966, one of two trees in New York City to have received that designation, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 along with the adjacent Kingsland Homestead. The Weeping Beech was partially removed in 1998. The region around the Weeping Beech, called Weeping Beech Park, contains a playground, the Kingsland Homestead, the John Bowne House, and several other historically significant trees. History and description Samuel Parsons, a nurseryman responsible for the planting of Central Park in Manhattan, purchased the cutting that produced the Weeping Beech while travelling in Belgium in 1846. The tree was on the estate of Baron DeMann in Beersal, Belgium, and transplanted to Flushing in 1847. Parsons also created a nursery in Queens in 1868. The nursery was later transported to Kissena Park, where it became a keystone of Flushing's horticultural industry until its closing in 1901. In 1966, the Weeping Beech was designated an official New York City landmark. At the time, the tree had grown to a spread of and a height of . The girth of the trunk was . The Weeping Beech was one of two trees in New York City that were designated as city landmarks, the other being the Magnolia grandiflora in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn. Weeping Beech Park Cedar of Lebanon The adjacent Weeping Beech Park was created in 1945 in order to protect the John Bowne House, which was designated a museum in 1947. Home to generations of the Bowne family until 1945, the Bowne House reportedly served as a stop on the Underground Railroad prior to the American Civil War. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a New York City landmark. The park also contains the Kingsland Homestead, a house named for sea captain Joseph King. Due to encroaching development from the proposed extension of the New York City Subway's Flushing Line in 1923, the house was moved twice, the second time to Weeping Beech Park. The Homestead is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also separately a New York City landmark. It was officially dedicated as a museum in March 1973 and is also home to the Queens Historical Society. The park includes a playground, rebuilt in 1956. The park also contains a grove of weeping beech trees, descendants of the original Weeping Beech planted in 1847. The grove is next to a rare Golden Larch that is on the sidewalk of 37th Avenue and a large Cedar of Lebanon is in the playground. Abutting the park are a diameter Northern Red Oak and a diameter White Oak, both of which top . Destruction and memorial alt= The tree started suffering from poor health in the late 1960s, and was being given fertilizer in an unsuccessful attempt to prolong its life. By 1998, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation declared the Weeping Beech to be dead. The city's parks commissioner held a \\"funeral\\" for the tree in December 1998 while the Parks Department decided what to do with the remains of the tree. In March 1999 it was decided that a section of the tree would remain in the park as a memorial. By then, the tree's progeny had been spread all over the United States. The rest of the tree would be given to artists to use for sculptures and benches along a heritage trail in downtown Flushing. A teacher at Flushing High School, Margaret L. Carman, had devised the idea for a trail; the park entrance at Bowne Street has a green named after her in honor of that vision.

The sanctuary first consisted of a sacred area, which in the archaic period included a small temple. The first more elabourate temple was erected in the 4th-century BC. In 146 BC, the city of Ancient Corinth was destroyed, and the temple fell in to ruins. When Roman Corinth was founded in 44 f.Kr, the sanctuary was reestablished. In the 1st century, three small Ionic temples were built. Pausanias described the temples of the sanctuary: :\\"[On the akropolis of Korinthos there is a] temple of the Moirai (Fates) and that of Demeter and Kore (the Maid) have images that are not exposed to view.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 4. 7 (trans.

All the children borne to him by his wife died the very first time they wailed. At last Demeter took pity on Plemnaios, came to Aigialea Sikyonia in the guise of a strange woman, and reared for Plemnaios his son Orthopolis.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 5. 8 The sanctuary was closed in the 4th-century during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Archeological remains indicate that the temple was attacked by Christian iconoclasts. In a Roman well situated in the sacred area, three heads of statues have been found, identified as a large head belonging to the cult statue of the goddess Demeter, and two smaller heads belonging to portrait sculptures of that of her two priestesses. The heads appear to have been decapitated from the statues, vandalised and thrown down the well. The dates of coins found at the site indicate that this incident occurred during the mid to late 4th-century, a period of persecution of pagans, when temples and shrines were attacked by Christians around the Roman Empire. Excavations has been made of the remains of the sanctuary. Significant archeological finds have been made. References * Nancy Bookidis, Ronald S.

The bulb is ovoid, about across, with a pale brown outer tunic. The bulb produces four or five leaves, long and wide, with flat or slightly undulate margins. The inflorescence is a dense raceme long, with a variable number of flowers. The flowering stem (scape) is shaded dark maroon or magenta on the lower half, with similarly coloured marks on the upper half. Individual flowers are slightly sweetly scented, with greenish white tepals up to long. The upper flowers have up to long pedicels, the lower ones are sessile. The inflorescence is topped by a head or \\"coma\\" of 9‚Äì16 bracts long. The ovary has three locules. The seeds are dull blackish brown. Taxonomy Eucomis grimshawii was first described in 2010 by Graham Duncan and Ben Zonneveld, and named after J. Grimshaw who first discovered it in 2002, in the southern Drakensberg, south of Lesotho. E. grimshawii is one of the group of smaller summer-growing diploid species of Eucomis. E. grimshawii most closely resembles Eucomis schijffii, but is shorter, and has greenish white, sweet-scented flowers rather than dark purple flowers with an unpleasant smell, and pale green rather than glaucous leaves. Both species have dull sculptured seeds rather than smooth glossy ones. Distribution and habitat Eucomis grimshawii was found in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in the Drakensberg Mountains, south of Lesotho, at an altitude of around . It grows in rich soil, on shady, seasonally wet, south- facing grassy slopes and in boggy conditions.

The Traditional Khmer Housing refers to the construction and assigned usage of houses or buildings by the Khmer people since the ancient time and evolved until today. In Cambodia, there are many Khmer style houses that are built in different ways depending on hierarchy and purposes. In special terms, the house is a symbol of prosperity in the national society, and it serves the lives of the people in each village, which is culture and nature The Khmer has long been known to traditionally live on different designs of stilt house and also has a multi-leveled floor and gable finials at both ends of the roof ridge. History Khmer traditional house in front of Angkor Wat taken between 1919 - 1926. =Houses and settlements= The earliest record of Cambodian housing is from the Chinese record of Funan kingdom (1st-7th century AD) where the residents were described as people who lived on stilt houses, cultivated rice and sent tributes of gold, silver, ivory and exotic animals.Pelliot, Paul (1903). \\"Le Fou-nan\\". Bulletin de l'√âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient (in French). 3: 248‚Äì303. doi:10.3406/befeo.1903.1216. Retrieved 22 October 2017. The people built their houses over the ground and made them accessible by ladders as seen across Cambodia today. The Chinese accounts also mentioned the walled towns, dwelling houses and palaces.A wooden structure as depicted on 12th century-Bayon temple's bas relief which shared similar triangular roof concept as the roof of today Khmer houses and pagodas. During the Khmer Empire (8th-15th century), high-status people were known to live in large houses, parts of which were covered in roof tiles where commoners lived in smaller houses with thatched roofs from perishable materials where they were not preserved until today. Additionally, houses were built on stilts so that the living floor was above the ground, according to Zhou Daguan who visited Angkor in 13th century. Bas reliefs from Bayon temple depicted houses, building, and palaces which shared similar roof design and concept with today Khmer traditional houses and palaces.A double-tiered roof of Khmer wooden architecture as depicted at Bayon temple. This roofing concept is commonly seen at today roof design of Khmer pagodas. =Royal Residence= A decorative gabled roof with adorants within the pediment and nagas-finials as depicted on Bayon's bas relief. This triangular gabled roof is almost identical with today Khmer architecture of palaces or pagodas. As the Khmer temples were usually built from brick, sandstone, and laterite, the royal residences of the Khmer courts were mostly built in wood and from other perishable materials where they are not preserved until the modern time. These brick or stone temples once were surrounded by wooden settlements that perished through times. For instance, the magnificent stone temples at Angkor were the only remains of a vast wooden settlements and palaces at the height of Khmer civilization. During Funan period, palaces and royal residences were mentioned in Chinese records, however, their actual appearance is unknown. The palace and royal residence of the succeeding Chenla kingdom (6th-9th century) with its centre at Isanapura were also in discussion. A type of traditional Khmer roofing concept known as somnong muk dach as depicted at an Angkorian temple. This roof design concept is still seen at some traditional Khmer buildings such as the National Museum of Cambodia, the old Royal Throne Hall, and some other pagodas' architecture (Wat Sangkae, destroyed during the Khmer Rouge). In Angkorian period, palaces were built in various locations such as on Kulen mountain (Mahendrapavarta), Hariharalaya, Koh Ker (Lingapura), and Angkor (Yasodharapura). Palace and royal residences at Angkor were undoubtedly one of the largest wooden structures in the capital and none of the structures survived today. However, Chinese emissary to Angkor in 13th century described the palace as a series of commanding buildings covered with lead tiled roofs. Bas reliefs at Bayon and Banteay Chhmar also depicted several wooden buildings with triangular pediments and roofs considered as the royal halls of Angkorian palacesAn original Throne Hall of Cambodian Royal Palace built between 1866-1870. It was demolished in 1915 and replaced with a new Throne Hall inaugurated in 1919 and remained there until today. Zhuo Daguan who visited Angkor in 13th century described the palace walls and audience hall as: > ‚ÄòThe royal palace, officials‚Äô residences, and great houses all face east. > The palace‚Ä¶ is about five or six li in circumference. The tiles of the main > building are made of lead; all the other tiles are made of yellow clay. The > beams and pillars are huge, and are all carved and painted with images of > the Buddha. The rooms are really quite grand looking, and the long corridors > and complicated walkways, the soaring structures that rise and fall, all > give a considerable sense of size. In the place for doing official business > there is a gold window, with rectangular pillars to the left and right of > the crosspieces‚Ä¶ I have heard that there are many wonderful places in the > inner palace, but it is very strictly out of bounds and I could not get to > see them.‚Äô Moreover, French Archaeologist Bernard-Philippe Groslier who conducted excavations at Angkorian Palace enclosure in the 1950s and 60s provides another useful description: > ‚Äò‚Ä¶in former days Angkor was a sea of roofs. In the centre of the city > sparkled the green and gold tiles of the royal palace, rising above its > plain surrounding wall of red laterite.

As Angkorian palace and royal residences were all wooden and the bas reliefs do not depicted the entirety of the royal residence compound, there are several alternative sources of comparison to reconstruct the appearance of the palace. Another suitable reference for the wooden royal palace of Angkor is the National museum of Cambodia in which it was modelled on traditional Khmer architecture that include wide range of Khmer decorative elements. Buddhist Monk's Residence The roof of Wat Botum shares the same roofing concept as seen on Khmer wooden architecture depicted at Bayon temple. Khmer pagoda and the Buddhist monks' residences in Cambodia all bears its origin from Angkorian wooden architecture as depicted on Angkorian bas reliefs. The residences of the Buddhist monks such as kut and sala chhann share similarity with traditional Khmer houses and sometimes resemble traditional Khmer houses, however they are more decorated with religious elements and design. Type of Khmer House for Ordinary People A compound of traditional Khmer house constructed along and over the pond resembling elite house in Cambodian Cultural Village, Siem Reap. Khmer people construct their house differently based on their social status, wealth, preference, and geographical location. However, what they shares in common is they are usually built as a stilt house where houses are raised on stilts over the surface of the soil or a body of water to prevent flooding. Floating houses were also built around the great lake region of Tonle Sap. =Pteas Pit = Pteas Pit house is called \\"Pteas Jorm\\" or \\" Pteas Krorjorm\\" depended on location. This type of house is the structure of the roof, how it is made or how it looks. Pteas Jorm's roof has 4 small roofs combined. This is a normal Pet house. Usually, if look at the layout of the house we can see that the door is only in the middle of the wall which is the biggest size. This type of house we can expand to many shapes by adding the roof. This is a Pteas Pit house which is 2 houses combined. Pteas Pit house can expand from 2 to 5 houses combined. Moreover, in combining we can connect it from front to behind, left to right or right to left, it looks like a twin house if 2 houses combined. Normally, the pattern on the ridge and the top is called \\" Meat \\" (Not sure this is correct because it is not included in the Cheonan Dictionary), as shown . In the end, there is a \\"creek\\" or some locals call \\"chicken tail\\". This type of houses were popular during France colony. Initially, the King Sisowath ruled people wanting to build a house with small roof. Second, the civilization of Monivong Row, one row of three rows is the largest called \\"mea dombou row. It was built in the middle of the house. Third, in the third reign, King Norodom Sihanouk , Vannavann Khmer was popular in most part of Phnom Penh, most houses in the Kingdom of Cambodia, while Thoranouk Chhouk and Duong were not very constructive. Houses and workshops were only home. =Pteas Rongdorl= The curtain is in the home of the \\"Rong\\". Basically, the crown is built using three rows of columns. The highest central rows are called some other rostrum pillars, called the piers. These middle column pins are larger than the side columns, with the rostrum function. In addition, it is often seen that the middle column pillar is the most luxurious. If the house has four columns of pillars, there are two rows of pillar lint between the columns. the right pillar. Sometimes we do not mind that your home is almost like a collapse of others, and there are also roof shapes. If the house is evaporated and the face is gone. What others (for example, towel, etc.). Basically, refers to a basic unit or structure, and in fact, any type of home is usually organized differently depending on the role or need. In the cinemas, there is a \\"space coffin\\" that can be used for various festivals. The \\"night room\\" is the pavilion. Whereas other booths, weddings, etc. The basic unit or structure can be expanded by adding more units or structures. As long as the expansion or expansion follows the traditional form, the main temple remains as same castle. The base courtyard with attached kitchen becomes a twin townhouse and a back porch. Various shadows in paintings by pagodas. In the reign of King Sreyrimey.. =Pteas Rongdeung = The house is constructed with a big roof and a pedestal near the front and rear before the reign of King Suriname and during the reign of King Ponhea Khemara. Observations coming to name the different types of Khmer houses are usually determined by the roof. The two-story home overlaid with two roofs in front and back. The central pillars have two rows of rooftop roofs. The substratum can form a corridor if it is covered by the second column. The corrugated plate on the corridor can be lowered slightly lower than the width of the house. At times, the door is made to four directions in all directions, and stairs at any door, whether the width or the length of the house are demanded. For example, the stairs are usually at the center of the house, but at times, such as wedding marriages, the children move the stairs to the side not far from the ceremony. It is said that in the past, it was often the home of the wounded or the mosque of the chief of the temple. It is believed that this type of house was a big house in Battambang of the time of the Lord. The design of the house is architectural. But if you look at ancient artifacts in the pagoda, it cannot be so. Maybe it's a house you're drowning or you've got a property, but it's a simple home, a wall, and a rooftop. During the Monarchy from 1794 to 1907. =Pteas Kontaing= The simplest PteasKontang's roof is generally triangular portion of roof pitches facing each other. The pillar has at least three rows at least. The center row is the highest called a rope, pillar or pillar. other rows called \\"veang row\\". Normally, the veang rows are at the corner of the house.The front door is always on the top of the stairs. This type of home pattern has existed for a long time, as we can see on various carvings, such as in Bayon Temple. This type of house, compared to the Rong Dorl house, Pit house, is most easiest constructed. While looking outdoors seem simple, in fact, they have various ways of organizing indoor for fulfill Cambodian favorite style , for example, below the roof they liked to build a shelf so they can be used it for store other things. This type of home is much more prevalent, especially in Kampong Cham province. This type of house can be a large house by combined 4 or 5 houses together. In addition, Pteas Kontang may have \\"wings\\" from the back of the hut and it commonly called \\"Swinging Swords\\", but some locals called \\"Banok\\" (meaning bird wing). This wing protects can protect the housefrom little rain. The height of the house is depending on the condition of the land, but if it built directly to the ground, it is called a \\"Tream\\". The structure is simpler than other types of houses structure.only having large logs and some simple materials can build the house. Because of its common and beautiful, it's easy to be found in Cambodia especially nowadays . Houses made of leaves can also be acalled as Pteas Kontang and it's easily to repair .. =Pteas Khmer= A type of traditional Khmer house known as Pteas Khmer in classification. Some kinds of Khmer house have a high roof and some don't have like Rongdorl or Rongderg. . Pteas Khmer houses have two roofs, making a sloping slope. One single home can be alone, a painting in the early 20th century, or consecutive twin or one row in a row. Also, most of the houses are rented by monks when they see some rows drop down the roof sometimes in front of the side to create the next apartment. To make Khmer houses, they have to have long sticks to be made of piles and rooftops and to use solid wood. So often people have the resources to afford to do Khmer house. We observe that they are doing this home for his or her living in the pagodas or the palace of the royal family, or one of the top officials. The Khmer House looks very stingy on the dance floor, many of them have designer designs, as shown in the picture. During the reign of King Kulondak (Preah Thaong) .. =Pteas Koeng= A type of Cambodian house that was built only for senior officials. The house was marked with two rooftops overlaid with two heads in front and rear. The central pillars have two rows of rooftop roofs. The substratum can form a corridor if it is covered by the second column. The corrugated plate on the corridor can be lowered slightly lower than the width of the house. At times, the door is made to four directions in all directions, and stairs at any door, whether the width or the length of the house, are demanded. This is a lively house built in 1907. From this base, it is further divided into the form. Traditional Rest House A rest house along a riverside built in traditional Khmer architecture in 1930s. Construction of rest houses were famous during the reign of Jayavarman VII, the great king of Khmer Empire. During his prosperous reign, Jayavarman VII built 121 \\"houses with fire\\" rest houses built every fifteen kilometers along raised highways for travellers, and 102 hospitals throughout his empire connecting Angkor to other Khmer cities such Phimai (present day Thailand), Vat Phu (present day Laos), and Champa (present day Central Vietnam).Coed√®s, George (1968). Walter F. Vella (ed.). The Indianized States of Southeast Asia. trans.Susan Brown Cowing. University of Hawaii Press. . This tradition has been practiced until today throughout Cambodia where traditionally wooden houses were built along the roads for the travelers to take a rest or shelter known as sala samnak (Khmer: ·ûü·û∂·ûõ·û∂·ûü·üÜ·ûé·û∂·ûÄ·üã). Governmental Buildings Although several governmental and public buildings in Cambodia in modern time were built in Western style during French colonial period, however many others were also built in traditional Khmer architecture. Some of them are the National Museum of Cambodia, the Cambodian Supreme Court, the National Assembly of Cambodia, and so on.

A States Department report dated January 17, 1951, states: > Subject: McCarran Act1‚ÄîPossible Conflict with Headquarters Agreement > In conversation with Abe Feller in New York recently he expressed the view > that the regulations which have been issued under the McCarran Act make it > fairly clear to him that there is likely to be some conflict between that > Act and the way in which it is being interpreted and the Headquarters > Agreement. He expressed the view that in the event of such conflict the UN > secretariat would be forced to resort to the arbitration procedure under the > Agreement. He stated he thought this would be very unfortunate and wondered > whether any consideration was being given to a general amendment to the > McCarran Act which would waive its provisions so far as it conflicted with > international obligations or international agreements. I told him I did not > know whether any amendments were under consideration but that I would bring > his view to your attention. Feller's appointment as chief legal counsel had upset the communist press: > Pravda, in an article published Feb, 21, 1951, said that Mr. Feller decided > all matters in the legal department and that Mr. Feller and Andrew W. > Cordier, Mr. Lie's executive assistant, were \\"agents of the American State > Department\\" and \\"American stooges\\" who \\"plan in the machinery of the > Secretariat various behind-the-scene actions connected with the American > aggression in Korea.\\" TIME magazine also reported that Feller was under no suspicion himself‚Äìand that the US hearings had \\"uncovered 17 among the 2,000 Americans on the UN staff who refused to say whether or not they have engaged in subversive activities.\\" However, according to Feller's grand-nephew, he had received a subpoena from Roy Cohn to appear before the SISS. Weeks before his death, he had become acting Assistant Secretary General of the UN. Personal life and death Alger Hiss (1950) was a friend of Feller's from Harvard Feller was \\"reportedly\\" a \\"close friend\\" of Alger Hiss. At the time of Feller's suicide, Hiss was already convicted of perjury in 1950 based on communism-related charges. On November 13, 1952, at 47, Feller committed suicide by jumping out of the window of his 12th-floor apartment in New York City. Secretary General Trygve Lie blamed \\"indiscriminate smears\\" from the McCarran committee. Lie said that Feller could not take the strain of investigations by a U.S. grand jury and the SISS. \\"But what depressed Feller most were the problems and pressures that had been laid on the U.N. in recent months by a Federal grand jury and the McCarran Senate subcommittee, in their investigation of subversive Americans on the U.N. Secretariat.\\" His wife said he had suffered a \\"nervous breakdown brought on by overwork.\\" According to a source unidentified by the New York Times, two recent events had depressed Feller: the defeat of Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson Jr. and the resignation of Secretary General Lie. The Fellers had one daughter. Writer Peter Birkenhead is his great- nephew. Aftermath Trygve Lie (1938) Lie characterized Feller's death as an \\"irreparable loss to the United Nations and to me personally.\\" Feller's wife said of him, \\"He was an idealist, and his whole life was devoted to the United Nations.\\" Ralph Bunche, the director of the \\"Department of Trusteeship\\" for the United Nations, \\"denounced Americans who bring pressure upon the United Nations as unable to understand that such an international body cannot serve the exclusive national interests of any member state\\". Dr. Bunche was alluding to the Senate Internal Security subcommittee.\\" According to the New York Times, members of the UN Secretariat believe that: > the subcommittee has not confined itself to a search for employees guilty of > espionage or of subversive activities, or for members of the Communist > party, but actually is on the trail of all with a Left Wing or New Deal > background. The Secretariat also complained of leaks to newspapers from the U.S. grand jury. Overall, the Secretariat had noticed that US government was ready to go after any Americans at the UN \\"who were ever in the slightest degree associated with Alger Hiss.

It was first described by William Frederick Reyneke in 1976. The reddish purple flowers appear in summer and are arranged in a spike (raceme), topped by a \\"head\\" of green leaflike bracts. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant and can be grown successfully outside where frosts are not too severe. The smallest of the species of Eucomis, it is particularly suited to being grown in rock gardens or containers. Description Eucomis schijffii is a short summer-growing bulbous plant. The smallest of the species of Eucomis , it is about tall. Its bulb is globular, across. Three to four ovate leaves emerge from the bulb and lie flat on the soil. The leaves are often bluish grey (glaucous), about long and across, sometimes purple tinged or spotted underneath. The leaf margins are smooth or with very small indentations. The flowers are arranged in a raceme on a purple stem (peduncule) tall. The raceme is topped by a head or \\"coma\\" of 10 to 15 ovate bracts that sometimes have purple margins. The unpleasantly scented flowers have six dark reddish purple tepals and purple stamen filaments, and are either sessile or have very short stalks (pedicels). The ovary, and the inflated capsule that develops from it, are greenish, generally with some purple shading. Taxonomy Eucomis schijffii was first described in 1976 by William Reyneke, who named it to honour his professor, H. P. van der Schijff. It is one of a group of mainly short, diploid species with 2n = 2x = 30 chromosomes. Its small stature and ovate leaves normally lying flat on the ground, along with purple flowers and stamen filaments, distinguish it from similar dwarf Eucomis species. Distribution and habitat Eucomis schijffii is endemic to the Drakensberg mountains of Lesotho and the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. It occurs up to , the highest altitude for any Eucomis species. It is found in somewhat shaded, damp rock faces and open rocky grassland where temperatures often fall below freezing in winter. Cultivation Eucomis schijffii is cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its small size makes it more suitable for rock gardens or containers, either outside or in a cool greenhouse. An acid growing medium is recommended. It is hardy down to if kept dry. It has been grown successfully outside in several locations in Britain. It can be propagated from seed, although seed-raised plants take four to five years to flower. It can also be propagated from leaf cuttings; the base of the leaf produces small bulblets.

It was the original home of Sunderland A.F.C hosting the club between 1880 and 1881. It hosted rivals Sunderland Albion F.C. between 1888 and 1892. While the home of Sunderland Albion, Blue House Field hosted matches in the Football Alliance and the FA Cup.  Sunderland A.F.C. Tenancy  Sunderland A.F.C, originally called Sunderland District Teachers Association Football Club, rented the Blue House Field on their formation in 1879 as it was in close proximity to the Hendon Board School where founder James Allan taught. They used it to train until they hosted their very first game on 13 November 1880. They had dropped the 'District Teachers' part of the name before playing a single game, having struggled to find enough teachers to field a team. The first game was a friendly against Ferryhill, which the visitors won 1 - 0. A few weeks later on Blue House Field, Sunderland won their first game; a 4 - 0 victory over Ovingham. Blue House Field hosted its first competitive football game on December 11 1880, when Sunderland faced Burnopfield in the Northumberland and Durham Challenge Cup, a precursor to the Durham Challenge Cup and the only opportunity for football teams in the North East to play competitive games at that time. The game ended in a 2 - 2 draw. The following season, Blue House Field hosted a handful of friendlies, but no competitive games, as Sunderland had been eliminated from the challenge cup while playing away to Sedgefield. The annual rent of ¬£10 was proving onerous for the fledgling club, so it moved away from Blue House Field to find a cheaper home.  Sunderland Albion F.C. Tenancy  In 1888, following a dispute over the direction of the club, Sunderland Albion F.C. were formed as a rival to Sunderland A.F.C. Although they played their first game at Newcastle Road, Albion came to find Blue House Field their home. Blue House Field lacked stands and fencing, meaning that spectators could watch games for free. This was in contrast to their older neighbours, who had moved into Newcastle Road and were charging spectators an entry fee. Undeterred, Albion, which contained a number of players poached from Sunderland A.F.C, quickly grew in stature, winning the Durham Challenge Cup in 1889 (holders Sunderland had chosen to withdraw from a game against Albion rather than allow them to take the gate receipts). = Football Alliance = Both clubs applied for membership to the Football League in 1889, but neither was accepted. Albion decided to become founder members of the Football Alliance instead. Blue House Field therefore hosted the first competitive league football in Sunderland, as Albion hosted 12 matches in the 1889-90 Football Alliance against teams including Nottingham Forest F.C. (won 4 - 0), Small Heath (later to become Birmingham City F.C.) (won 6 - 1), Newton Heath (later to become Manchester United F.C.) (won 4 - 0), and the eventual champions Sheffield Wednesday F.C. (lost 3 - 2). The relative success of the club led to Blue House Field being expanded, with a cycle track and a grandstand added. Albion's application to join the Football League was again rejected, while Sunderland A.F.C (who had spent the 1889-90 season playing friendly matches) were accepted into the league. League membership brought with it both national prestige and local crowds, which dealt a huge blow to Albion's long-term ambitions of becoming the town's main team. Now over-shadowed by their neighbours, they decided to play in two leagues simultaneously; the Football Alliance and the Northern Football League. In the 1890‚Äì91 Football Alliance they finished a narrow second to Stoke City F.C. who had been ejected from the Football League at Sunderland's expense. They remained unbeaten at Blue House Field that season and recorded an impressive 11 - 1 victory over Walsall F.C. = Northern League = Albion also took part in the 1890-91 Northern Football League, finishing third. In that season, Blue House Field also hosted FA Cup football, as Albion reached the last 16, drawing at home to Nottingham Forest F.C. before losing a third replay on neutral ground. Despite impressive performances, Albion's league application was once again rejected, with a solitary vote being cast in their favour. Facing financial difficulty, Albion elected not to play in the Alliance (with its relatively long-distance travel), instead choosing to focus on the more local Northern Football League. They finished sixth in the 1891-92 season. in April 1892, Blue House Field once again hosted Sunderland A.F.C - eleven years after the club moved away. Albion welcomed their Football League rivals for a friendly match, the fourth and final meeting between the clubs, and the first not to be played at Newcastle Road. It did not end well for the hosts, with Sunderland, who were just about to be crowned English Champions for the first time, running out 8 - 0 winners in front of an estimated crowd of 2,000. With the financial troubles mounting, Albion folded in the summer of 1892, and Blue House Field no longer played host to professional football, though to this day it still plays host to amateur and junior teams.

In India, the Me Too movement is seen as either an independent outgrowth influenced by the international campaign against sexual harassment of women in the workplace, or an offshoot of the American \\"Me Too\\" social movement. Me Too began gaining prominence in India with the increasing popularity of the international movement, and later gathered sharp momentum in October 2018 in the entertainment industry of Bollywood, centered in Mumbai, when actress Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of sexual harassment. This led to many women in the news media, Indian films, and even within the government to speak out and bring allegations of sexual harassment against a number of perpetrators. Origins in India =Influence of Hollywood's \\"Me Too\\" Movement= MeToo movement was founded by Tarana Burke but began as a social phenomenon in October 2017 as a hashtag started by American actress Alyssa Milano who shared her story of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein. Shortly afterward, women from across the world began talking about their survivor stories. In India, however, the MeToo movement didn't gain much traction until actress Tanushree Dutta decided to speak up once against actor Nana Patekar. What began as one woman's story soon became a phenomenon when the names of powerful men in the country started surfacing. From actor Alok Nath to journalist and politician MJ Akbar, the movement has brought to light many stories of sexual harassment and abuse. After allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the use of the #MeToo hashtag on social media with respect to the event spread quickly in India, where sexual harassment is commonly referred to by the word 'eve-teasing', a term described as misleading, tame, and diluting the seriousness of the crime. In response to #MeToo, there have been attempts to teach Indian women about workplace rights and safe reporting, as well as educating men about the scope of the problem. Some have likened #MeToo to a 2012 social movement which followed a violent gang rape in New Delhi that later resulted in a woman's death, which caused the Indian government to institute harsher punishments for rape. Others have suggested there was underlying public anger over a Delhi rape conviction that was overturned by Judge Ashutosh Kumar a month before against filmmaker and writer Mahmood Farooqui, ruling that a \\"feeble no\\" was not enough to revoke consent because it was typical for one partner to be less willing. The case is being appealed to the Supreme Court. Activist Jasmeen Patheja, head of Blank Noise, stated #MeToo's power is in demonstrating India can no longer ignore the scope of the problem. Kaimini Jaiswal, a lawyer at the Supreme Court of India, stressed the importance of teaching women how to read, especially in rural villages, because most women in these areas are illiterate and completely financially and emotionally dependent on a male relative. Blogger Sheena Dabolkar's viral #MeToo tweet resulted in the boycott of Khodu Irani's popular Pune pub High Spirits, by several well-known performers. Several women mentioned Mahesh Murthy, which initiated a police case in January 2018. Trends Desk of The Indian Express wrote that many Indian men are speaking up as a part of #MeToo, including discussions about consent and how some men are also abused. Rina Chandran of Reuters said #MeToo is ignoring the 600,000 women in India who are currently sex workers against their will, and are typically poor without education or family. There were reports of mass sexual assaults during the 2018 New Year's celebrations in Bangalore, which have been associated with #MeToo. The incidents were initially dismissed by the police until someone uploaded CCTV footage of the assaults to social media. Home Minister G. Parameshwara, Abu Azmi, and other officials came under fire for stating \\"western\\" women's clothing and values were the cause of the rapes, and indicated women's families should not allow them to go to parties or major celebrations. Several lists of alleged rapists and harassers started spreading on social media in India, including \\"The List\\", which initially included the names of about 60 highly respected academic men. The List was posted on 24 October 2017 by activist Inji Pennu and an Indian student in California named Raya Sarkar, who alleged they personally confirmed every incident. This list has resulted in criticism against #MeToo because the allegations were unverified before they started spreading on social media. Some of the victims from the list have come forward to explain they were ignored, mistreated, or retaliated against when they tried to pursue action. Sarkar has defended The List, saying that she posted it only to warn her friends about professors and academics to avoid (mostly upper-caste men), and had no idea it would become so popular. A second list came out a week later that was made by women from lower caste backgrounds and included more names, bringing the total up to around 70. Twelve prominent Indian feminists dismissed The List in a formal letter, saying they understand that the justice system is typically tilted against victims, but unverified claims make things harder for the feminist movement. Writers Rhea Dangwal and Namrata Gupta responded that most victims from the list were poor students who tried to go through official channels without success or recourse, while every single man on the list has the ability to defend himself socially and legally. =Tanushree Dutta's allegations= Actress Tanushree Dutta's allegations of sexual harassment in 2018 was a catalyst of the \\"Me Too\\" movement in India On 26 September 2018, after having been out of the Bollywood spotlight for about a decade, actress Tanushree Dutta gave an interview to Zoom TV in which she publicly accused Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her on the set of the 2009 movie Horn 'Ok' Pleassss. This declaration would be seen as the catalyst of the Me Too movement in India, similar to one which happened in the U.S. a year earlier with Harvey Weinstein, in which more and more women in the entertainment industry would publicly announce high-profile individuals who had sexually exploited them. Dutta had first made the allegations against Patekar in 2008, filing a complaint with the 'CINTAA' (Cine & TV Artists Association), but no action was taken as the case was considered a criminal case. The allegation was repeated in 2013 in an interview, and again largely ignored. It was not until her September 2018 statements that the CINTAA apologized to Dutta, admitting that the \\"chief grievance of sexual harassment wasn't even addressed [in 2008]\\", but added that since the case was more than three years old, they could not reopen it. Janice Sequeira, a journalist, backed her allegations, claiming to be an eyewitness to the incident. She also alleged that filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri had told her to remove her clothes and dance with Irrfan Khan to act on the sets of Chocolate. She said Irrfan Khan and Sunil Shetty stood up for her during this episode. Vivek refuted all such allegations and shared that it is an attempt to get publicity by Tanushree Dutta and to malign his image in a legal notice sent to her. The assistant director of Chocolate, Sattyajit Gazmer, also denied Tanushree's claims. In an interview, Tanushree said \\"He (Nana Patekar) called the MNS (Maharashtra Navnirman Sena) party to bash up my car. He was behind everything and was supported by choreographer Ganesh Acharya\\". In a video from 2008 that went viral on the internet, goons are seen thrashing Tanushree's car. A journalist named Pawan Bharadwaj, was seen thrashing the car's windshield with his camera, and later clarified that he attacked her car because earlier, he had a fight with Dutta's team. A defamation case was filed against her for her comments about the MNS party. She was also served with two legal notices from Nana Patekar and Vivek Agnihotri. On 6 October 2018, Dutta filed an FIR at Oshiwara police station against actor Nana Patekar, director Rakesh Sarang, choreographer Ganesh Acharya, and producer Sami Siddiqui. In mid October, Dutta sought the help of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission (MSWC) in order to conduct a full- scale investigation on the issue; they sent notices to Nana Patekar, director Rakesh Sarang and choreographer Ganesh Acharya, whom they directed to respond within 10 days. On 16 November, several weeks after the MSWC issued a warning to Patekar, his lawyer Aniket Nikam released a statement refuting the allegations, stating, \\"All allegations against him (Nana Patekar) are false and far from the truth\\". In June 2019, the Mumbai Police closed the case after informing the courts that there was no evidence to prosecute Patekar. Notable people who have shared their \\"Me Too\\" stories publicly include: * Yashika Aannand * Jasmin Bhasin * Sangeetha Bhat * Priyanka Bose * Chinmayi * Amyra Dastur * Tina Datta * Tanushree Dutta * Sanjjanaa Galrani * Sruthi Hariharan * Nishtha Jain * Ketki Joshi * Mandana Karimi * Aahana Kumra * Leena Manimekalai * Pooja Misrra * Sona Mohapatra * Sandhya Mridul * Navneet Nishan * Elnaaz Norouzi * Shweta Pandit * Amala Paul * Kangana Ranaut * Soni Razdan * Sri Reddy Mallidi * Flora Saini * Shama Sikander * Niharika Singh * Diandra Soares * Sunaina * Kaneez Surka * Ira Trivedi * Sonal Vengurlekar * Rachel White * Kubbra Sait =Entertainment= Phantom Films In October 2018, in an interview with Huffington Post India, a former employee of Phantom Films accused director Vikas Bahl of sexually harassing her on the set of the 2014 film Queen. Later, the film's lead actress Kangana Ranaut, in support of the former employee, also accused Bahl of sexual misconduct. Following this, Nayani Dixit, Ranaut's co-star in the movie, levelled similar accusations against Bahl. As a result, Phantom Films announced its dissolution on 5 October 2018, largely in response to the sexual assault allegation against Bahl by another former Phantom employee, which was reported in 2015. The other three founders, Kashyap, Motwane, and Mantena, all issued statements on Twitter confirming the company's disbanding and moving on to independent projects. Utsav Chakraborty And All India Bakchod (AIB) On 7 October 2018, stand-up comedian and popular YouTuber Utsav Chakraborty, who worked as a freelancer with the comedy group All India Bakchod, was accused of sending women lewd messages and photos via social messaging apps. The allegations against Utsav blew up when a Twitter user named Mahima Kukreja put up a Twitter post accusing the comedian of sending her an unsolicited picture of his genitalia and then pleading with her not to make his act public as it would \\"ruin\\" his career. Several comedians within his circle, including Kunal Kamra and Tanmay Bhat, knew about his habit of harassing underage girls but opted to keep quiet and work with him. On 8 October 2018, Gursimran Khamba provided clarification on some sexual harassment allegations reported by an unknown girl who claimed Khamba had sexually assaulted her. Khamba, on the other hand, denied the allegation, claiming that the relationship was consensual. On 10 October 2018, comedienne Kaneez Surka accused Aditi Mittal, who had appeared on the All India Bakchod Knockout, of 'forcefully kissing her on her mouth without consent' and that she was triggered by Mittal championing the cause of the movement. On 16 October 2018, Yash Raj Films (YRF) terminated the services of Ashish Patil, who was their Vice-President of Brand Partnerships and Talent Management, and Business and Creative Head for Y Films, after he was accused of forcibly kissing and making advances on an anonymous aspiring actress. The anonymous woman texted her #MeToo story to an activist who tweeted screenshots with the woman's permission. In May 2019, the group announced that they had to let go of their entire team in the wake of the controversy and that their YouTube channel would remain inactive indefinitely. While Bhat's suspension was lifted, he was barred from holding the position of CEO and Khamba was let go of. Joshi and Shakya the remaining two members too would pursue independent careers. Housefull 4 On 12 October 2018, after accusations from several women of abusive and perversive sexual behavior, director Sajid Khan announced that he would step back from the production of his upcoming film Housefull 4 until he could clear his name. Actor Akshay Kumar also made a statement on Twitter, confirming Sajid's stepping away and also halting shooting of the film until further notice. Later in the day, actor Nana Patekar noted that he would also be leaving the film, due to accusations against him by ex-actress Tanushree Dutta. On 14 October, it was announced that Farhad Samji, who co-directed Housefull 3, would be replacing Sajid Khan as the director. On 15 October 2018, The Indian Film and Television Directors‚Äô Association issued a show cause notice to Khan, which read \\"Your...actions have brought disrepute to Indian Film and Television Directors‚Äô Association,\\". It further noted that they expected an explanation from Khan \\"for such offensive behaviour within seven days of the receipt of the notice for further action as per the rules and regulations‚Ä¶ In case of no reply, ex-parte decision would be taken.\\" In December 2018, Sajid Khan was suspended from IFTDA (Indian Film and Television Director's Association) for one year, following the accusations of sexual assault against him from three women. A source from the association said that IFTDA \\"investigated the complaints in the spirit of POSH Act,\\" and said that Khan did not offer an explanation as to his actions even when given an opportunity to do so, however he did expose his \\"real self\\" in an earlier interview where he admitted to his actions. Fox Star Studios India On 19 October 2018, casting director and first-time film director Mukesh Chhabra was suspended by the Fox Star Studios India company from directing their Bollywood remake of The Fault in Our Stars (titled Kizie Aur Manny, later Dil Bechara) pending an inquiry against him over sexual harassment allegations. Chhabra has denied the charges, telling a newspaper that he would pursue \\"every possible legal action to protect my reputation.\\" In a statement, Fox Star Studios said that Chhabra was suspended until \\"the Internal Complaints Committee of Mukesh Chhabra Casting Company concludes its inquiry into the allegations against him.\\" Alok Nath v. Vinta Nanda In October 2018, veteran character actor Alok Nath was accused of rape by TV producer Vinta Nanda who worked with him in the TV show Tara in the mid-1990s. Alok Nath has denied the allegation. Subsequently, actresses Renuka Shahane, Himani Shivpuri, Sandhya Mridul, and Deepika Amin have either admitted to knowing about Nath's predatory behaviour or written about instances where they themselves have been assaulted by him. On 15 October 2018, Nath sued Nanda for defamation, asking for a written apology and 1 as compensation. He has filed the case jointly with his wife Ashu Nath. The Cine and TV Artists Association (CINTAA) sent Mr. Nath a show cause notice on Vinta Nanda's post. The association asked why he should not be expelled from CINTAA. The actor urged that the notice be withdrawn, that he was innocent until proven guilty. In response to Alok Nath's lawsuit, on 15 October Vinta Nanda's lawyer responded: \\"She will not be intimidated by threats and defamation suits which are primarily meant to delay and distract from the gravity of the allegations.\\" Alok Nath had earlier been quoted by ABP News as saying he could \\"neither deny nor agree\\" with Ms Nanda's account of rape and violation on Facebook. The writer had not named him but had identified him as the \\"Sanskaari actor\\" who played the lead on her show \\"Tara\\". On 14 November 2018, the CINTAA expelled Alok Nath from their organization after he failed to appear at a body meeting on 12 November to discuss his rape accusations against Vinta Nanda, and instead sent a response to the 'show-cause' notice instead. CINTAA secretary general Sushant Singh noted that the group's EC (Executive Committee) \\"unanimously voted him out.\\" When asked if the organization should have allowed its Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to handle the case, Singh responded that the ICC had not yet been completely trained in POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) on how to \\"hear cases, take a deposition, cross-question, among many other things,\\" and that they had to follow their \\"current provisions\\" for now. Nanda responded to the expulsion by applauding the decision, saying that \\"at the end of the day we all have to acknowledge that we are answerable and accountable to our governing bodies. It‚Äôs only then, that institutions like CINTAA, IFTDA (Indian Film & Television Directors‚Äô Association) and Screenwriters Association (SWA) will achieve the status they deserve.\\" KWAN Entertainment On 16 October 2018, entertainment talent management agency KWAN announced that founder Anirban Blah had been asked to step down after four women publicly accused him of harassment. In a statement, KWAN said,\\" We have asked Anirban Blah to forthwith step aside from his duties, activities and responsibilities at KWAN, its subsidiaries and affiliates with immediate effect.\\" The company, which promotes high-profile celebrities such as Deepika Padukone, Tiger Shroff, and Ranbir Kapoor, has a Prevention of Sexual Harassment committee in place.  Vairamuthu  Vairamuthu, Tamil poet, lyricist, author, and a recipient of various awards including the Padma Bhushan and Sahitya Akademi Award, was accused of sexual misconduct and sexual harassment by several women singers and artists from the Tamil film industry. A few women described their allegations anonymously, but Singer Chinmayi used her Twitter account to highlight the instances of intimidation and harassment she suffered at his hands. Following this, Sindhuja Rajaram, an artist, photographer, and musician based in California, United States, also accused Vairamuthu and detailed the harassment she faced due to him. Vairamuthu remained noncommittal about the allegations against him on Twitter. On 15 October 2018, he made an official video statement saying that he found the allegations against him unfounded and challenged his accusers to take legal action against him. Salman Khan Pooja Misrra, ex-Bigg Boss contestant, alleged that the brothers Salman Khan, Arbaaz Khan, and Sohail Khan raped her multiple times. Arjun Sarja In October 2018, Sruthi Hariharan, a major actress of Kannada cinema, revealed multiple instances of actor Arjun Sarja's misbehaviour towards her. The actress revealed that Arjun had made unwelcome advances towards her during the making of Nibunan (2017), by often changing the script to include more physically intimate scenes. Kailash Kher Kher was called out for sexual misconducts by multiple women during Indian Me Too movement 2018. Anu Malik On 21 October 2018, singer/composer/TV show judge Anu Malik was asked to step down from judging the reality TV show Indian Idol 10 after being accused of sexual harassment from multiple women. An assistant producer on Indian Idol 5, Danica D'Souza, has been reported as saying that the producers knew of Malik's harassing behaviour, but previously had not taken it seriously enough. D'Souza noted that \\"They knew he abused power but nothing came of it. In fact, they told us all to take precaution by not meeting him alone.\\" Later that day, Sony TV released an official statement regarding Malik's dismissal: \\"Anu Malik is no longer a part of the Indian Idol jury panel. The show will continue its planned schedule and we will invite some of the biggest names in Indian music as guests to join Vishal and Neha to judge Indian Idol season 10.\\" Malik himself released a statement: \\"I, Anu Malik, have decided to take a break from Indian Idol as I am currently unable to focus on my work, my music and the show\\". In the 1990s, singer Alisha Chinai had also accused Malik of molesting her, but faced legal challenges in doing so. She filed a case against him and demanded ‚Çπ2,660,000, whereas in return, Malik had filed a defamation case asking for ‚Çπ20,000,000 from Chinai. Chinai eventually won the legal battle in an \\"unprecedented landmark verdict\\", and a restraining order was passed against Malik. She vowed to never work with Malik again but eventually forgave him, and sang for him in a song in the film Ishq Vishq, which Malik musically directed; the two later judged a season of Indian Idol together. Malik returned to the Indian Idol in 2019 and accusers expressed their anger all over again. Neha Bhasin and Shweta Pandit had also accused Malik of inappropriate behaviour.

At least ten allegations have emerged against Akbar, the first public servant in high office to be accused. Akbar's colleagues, including Smriti Irani and Maneka Gandhi, have acknowledged the online testimonies against him and called for a probe. The Ministry of Women and Child Development announced that a panel would be set up to examine the existing legal framework for harassment at work. In mid-October, a 41-page letter was written to Delhi's chief metropolitan magistrate by Akbar, which accused journalist Priya Ramani of defaming him on scandalous grounds. Ramani said she was \\"deeply disappointed\\" with Akbar's decision to take legal action against her. On 16 October, journalist Tushita Patel (wife of Aakar Patel, director of Amnesty International India) published an article on Scroll.in detailing instances of sexual harassment by Akbar during meetings with him in the early 1990s, when Akbar was the editor-in-chief of the Deccan Chronicle, and Patel was a senior sub-editor. In a calmly indignant tone, Patel narrated separate incidents in which Akbar indecently exposed himself to her, and also forcibly kissed her, leaving her traumatized. She ended the article affirming the power of the solidarity and union of his female victims, who would be vocal against him in court proceedings: \\"The same sisterhood of solidarity that held our hands through the darkest times of our lives will come out only because you continue to be brazen. We are not confused, conflicted or vulnerable any more. Our time to speak is now ‚Äì when we don‚Äôt have to run to a police station to lodge a complaint before anyone would give us a hearing.\\" M.J. Akbar resigned from the post of Minister of State for External Affairs on 17 October, having decided to fight in a personal capacity the allegations made against him.

Akbar himself was not present, but was represented by his lawyer Geeta Luthra. Luthra said that \\"at this stage all that she has to show is that Akbar's reputation has suffered, and that the allegedly defamatory remarks were read by others.\\" The court said that it would record his statement on 31 October 2018. National Students Union of India (NSUI) national president On 16 October 2018, Rahul Gandhi, president of the INC, accepted NSUI national president Fairoz Khan's resignation after he was accused of sexual harassment. He was accused by a female member of the INC from Chhattisgarh. INC had ordered a three-member committee to investigate the matter. Khan denied the charges but stated he was stepping down as it was hurting the party's image. The woman had first complained against Khan to Rahul Gandhi in June 2018. She also demanded protection, as she feared for her life.  Sexual Harassment Allegations against Chief Justice of India  In April 2019, Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi was accused of sexual harassment by a former Supreme Court of India employee. A three-judge internal investigation committee had given him clean chit but was severely criticised for being opaque, unfair and one-sided, thus violating principles of natural justice.Judicial Emergency: Justice and Country Blindfolded https://www.livelaw.in/columns/judicial- emergency-justice-emasculated-and-country-blindfolded-144845Mounting Criticism Against Clean Chit To CJI In Sexual Harassment Case https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/cji-clean-chit-reactions-144846 Gogoi described the allegation as an attempt to hamper the independence of the judiciary and a danger to democracy. Several eminent personalities from legal fraternity including two retired Supreme Court justices questioned the in- house panel's decision. In an opinion piece written in the Indian Express titled \\"A One Sided Justice\\", Justice Madan Lokur had commented that the Court was driven by an \\"institutional bias\\" while dismissing the allegations raised by the woman. Justice Jasti Chelameswar had said that the Supreme Court did not follow due process while hearing the sexual harassment charges against the Chief Justice of India. =Education= Symbiosis Centre for Media and Communication (SCMC) Alumni of the Symbiosis Centre for Media and Communication (SCMC) in Pune took to social media to share harrowing accounts of harassment by some faculty members and their seniors; about 25 students and alumni of the college shared their ordeals, charging two faculty members and some senior students with harassment and molestation. They also said that the institution failed to take concrete action against the accused faculty members. Soon afterwards, SCMC authorities issued an apology on Facebook and promised an investigation by the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). Dr Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society, said that the Symbiosis University Management is \\"doing its best to abide by UGC rules.\\" He noted that a \\"high power internal complaints committee, consisting of the vice- chancellor, dean, registrar and the director of the institution, has been constituted.\\" The committee, he said, will take necessary steps to investigate any claims and consequences. On 21 October, the university decided to send Anupam Siddhartha, director of SCMC, on leave pending an inquiry. In the days prior, a petition had been signed by 106 students, both current students and alumni of SCMC, who gave \\"graphic details of years of alleged harassment and abuse at the hands of the SCMC director,\\" as reported by NDTV. Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of SIU, said, \\"There was already an internal complaints committee, which had been set up to look into the allegations raised in the past, some of which were against Siddhartha... some of the allegations were shocking and we immediately referred it to the ICC, who called him on Saturday for investigations. Based on the recommendation of the ICC, which has said that he should stay away from campus duties pending an inquiry, he will be sent on leave from Monday.\\" The sexual harassment case was demised after a three month long investigation, though he was charged with disciplinary excessive issues. Sreeram Gopalkrishnan was then appointed the director of Symbiosis Centre for Media & Communication (SCMC). = November 2018 Caravan Magazine Investigations = The November 2018 issue of Caravan, a prominent Indian news magazine, investigated at length three prominent cases of workplace sexual harassment: involving entertainment behemoth, Only Much Louder, prominent television journalist and anchor, Gaurav Sawant, and another famous artist, Jatin Das. The charges against Only Much Louder  famous for starting the NH7 Weekender and the power behind comedy groups All India Bakchod and East India Comedy - included serial charges of sexual harassment against the company's co-founder, Vijay Nair. The story also detailed how the company failed in its internal handling of sexual harassment charges that came to its notice. The same cover story also detailed a harrowing account of sexual misdemeanor by TV anchor, Gaurav Sawant, against journalist Vidya Krishnan. As per the account published in the magazine, Krishnan alleged that during a reporting trip to the Beas in Punjab, Sawant tried to repeatedly molest her. In the article, Krishnan says to Nikita Saxena, the author of the said article, \\"I was really excited about being counted, being sent from Pioneer with all the supposedly senior journalists,\\" Sawant, who had earlier reported on the Kargil war in 1999, was part of the entourage Krishnan was travelling with. In the Army jeep, Sawant allegedly touched Krishnan on her right shoulder and slowly moved his hands to her breast, later on pretending as if nothing had happened. \\"When the group returned to their hotel rooms in the evening, Vidya says she received a message from Gaurav that he wanted her to come to his room. When Vidya tried to brush him off politely, Gaurav reportedly said that what he had in mind was 'nothing naughty' and he 'just wanted to get into a bathtub with her.' Gaurav then came to her room unexpectedly, she says, and dropped his pants and tried to sexually assault her. She tried to push him away, but could not, Vidya says.\\" \\"I felt like he was overpowering me, which is why in my panic I started screaming,\\" Vidya's response managed to drive Gaurav off, who pretended as if nothing had happened the next day.  Challenges  India's Me Too movement differs in key ways from the movement in the United States. The allegations against Harvey Weinstein were investigated by reliable sources in the US, while in India, accusations emerged on social media, where women posted their grievances. In addition, laws against defamation in India allow the prosecution of women who are unable to prove their allegations, with a maximum jail term of two years, while the First Amendment protects such rights in the United States. As a result, activists began to work towards strengthening the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, which was implemented poorly since its establishment. As of mid-October 2018, the social \\"Me Too\\" campaign of India has continued to grow and be covered by major media outlets as a topic of importance, with victims outing their abusers on a nearly daily basis. The movement has since resulted in major social consequences for several of those accused, such as firing or resignation from their jobs, condemnation and disassociation from members of their respective industries, and indignation against their actions from their fans and/or the public at large. Similarly, accusers have also been the target of countersuits from the accused, even as they often have social support and added coverage from the media.  Criticism  Journalist Seema Mustafa has expressed encouragement for the women who have shared their personal experiences and has said that this is a big achievement for India's women's movement, but she has also felt that the movement lacks internal criticism, which would have been helpful in strengthening the cause. Tavleen Singh of ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Indian Express‚Äô‚Äô has criticized the Me Too movement participants in India, claiming the ‚Äòliberals‚Äô leading the movement are illiberal towards disagreements with their point of view. Govind Krishnan V of ‚Äò‚ÄôFirstpost‚Äô‚Äô concurred with Mustafa's sentiments and additionally stated that one limitation of the movement in India was that it shuts itself from constructive criticism, which would help to strengthen the movement. As an analogy, he mentioned that feminism has evolved over time due to this type of criticism: \\"Me Too movement needs more nuanced and richer conversations which have space for debate, disagreement and dissent. The movement needs deeper forms of engagement and a collective will to develop a self-critical discourse which can generate essential kind of intellectual spade work.\\" Mustafa also expressed her reservations about the tone and tenor of the Me Too movement on social media. A key point of her criticism was the movement's 'inability to differentiate between a man who is guilty of rape and sexual assault from a man who solicited a woman with a drink, or an unacceptable text message', arguing it offers the same ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô for all. Krishna too shared the viewpoint, writing, \\"This remains a challenge of great importance for India‚Äôs MeToo, which it has not yet succeeded in overcoming\\". Mustafa and Singh both said that the current movement in India is \\"exclusive, elite and metropolitan in nature\\", failing to represent ordinary Indians. Mustafa has spoken of justice as a concept where an innocent man is not supposed to be framed, even if it means the guilty get away. She has rebuked the Me Too movement as \\"too subjective, arbitrary and without due responsibility\\". Mustafa has also criticized the \\"mob mentality\\" of the movement as the accusations on social media deny the accused a proper chance to defend themselves.

History After the Franco-Prussian War, the Army began to study replacements for its 12 cm Kanone C/64 breech loaded cannons. Although Prussian artillery had outclassed their French rivals during the war the breech mechanism they used was weak and there was a tendency for barrels to burst due to premature detonation of shells. In 1873 a new gun which retained the same caliber as the previous gun and designated the 12 cm Kanone C/73 was introduced to replace the C/64 but it had poor range so it was quickly replaced. The new gun designated the 12 cm Kanone C/80 was assigned to fortress and siege artillery regiments of the Army. Design During the Franco-Prussian war, large numbers of French bronze cannons were captured and this material was melted down and used to build the new 12 cm Kanone C/80 and the smaller 9 cm Kanone C/79. The C/80 would use the same rounded breech block introduced on the C/73 to avoid the stress fractures which caused catastrophic failures in the square blocked C/64. This type of breech was known as a cylindro-prismatic breech which was a predecessor of Krupp's horizontal sliding-block and the gun used separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The C/80 was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns such as its Russian cousin the 42-line fortress and siege gun Pattern of 1877 or its French rival the Canon de 120 mm mod√®le 1878. Like many of its contemporaries, the C/80 had a tall and narrow box trail carriage built from bolted iron plates with two wooden 12-spoke wheels. The carriages were tall because the guns were designed to sit behind a parapet with the barrel overhanging the front in the fortress artillery role or behind a trench or berm in the siege role. Like many of its contemporaries, the C/80's carriage did not have a recoil mechanism or a gun shield. However, when used in a fortress the guns could be connected to an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on a concrete firing platform and a hook on the carriage between the wheels. For siege gun use a wooden firing platform could be assembled ahead of time and the guns could attach to the same type of recoil mechanism. A set of wooden ramps were also placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by gravity. There was also no traverse so the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire. For transport, the gun was attached to a limber for towing by a horse team or artillery tractor.  World War I  The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Since the C/80 was heavier and wasn't designed with field use in mind it was employed as a fortress gun. However, once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for artillery to send to the front. A combination of factors led the Germans to issue C/80's to their troops as replacements. These included: * An underestimation of light field artillery losses during the first two years of the war and an inadequate number of replacement guns being produced. * An underestimation of ammunition consumption, inadequate production capacity, and resulting shortages. * Since C/80's had been relegated to garrison duty there were fairly large numbers of them still in service and since there wasn't another gun that used the same ammunition there was an adequate stockpile of ammunition. * Existing light field guns weren't tall enough to fire over the edge of trenches and their carriages weren't capable of high-angles of fire which meant that despite having gun shields their crews were vulnerable to counter-battery fire. Also, many light artillery pieces didn't have the range necessary to be used in an indirect-fire role. Although new guns with superior performance were introduced the C/80 remained in service until the end of the war due to the sheer number in service.

Early life Wharton's early life is unclear, during his boxing career he described himself as being born in Tangier, Morocco on 3 March 1813 and that his mother was a peasant, while his father was a sailor. However, in the 1851 census Wharton gave London as his place of birth. Wharton said he started working as a cabin boy on the a ship called Hopewell at the age of twelve. It was on the Hopewell that he began boxing. Career Wharton fought multiple challengers in the early 1830s while working on the Hopewell. One of Wharton's earliest wins was against the cook of the Hopewell who accused him of stealing food. He then went to London to train under retired fighter Jem Burn. Wharton won his first three career fights against Tom McKeevor in 1833, \\"the Herefordshire Pippin\\" Evans in 1834, and \\"the Hammersmith Cowboy\\" Jack Wilsden in 1835. After the cancellation of an 1835 match against Nick Ward, Wharton toured with Deaf Burke. Later in the year, he won a match against Bill Fisher. In 1836, Wharton had his only draw in his career against Tom Britton. During the match, fans of Britton threw stuff at Wharton and threatened him. Wharton's match against Britton lasted over four hours with 200 rounds before a draw was called. After the match, Wharton toured with Deaf Burke's trainer Tommy Roundhead. In 1837, Wharton went to Liverpool, England to face Harry Preston. Wharton won the match when he made Preston unconscious from a throw. Throughout 1837, Wharton won matches against Sandy MacNeish in Scotland and William Renwick in England. In 1839, Wharton won a rematch against Renwick. In 1840, Wharton fought against John Lane. While Wharton almost lost to Lane by a chokehold, Wharton defeated Lane and won his final match. Wharton retired undefeated in 1840. He went onto work as a trainer and operated a pub in Liverpool.

The centerpiece of the project is the replacement of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, which carries Interstate 95 over the Quinnipiac River.http://www.i95newhaven.com/ The program also included the reconstruction of parts of Interstate 91, Connecticut Route 34, and US Route 1 that connect to and run near the interchange, as well as other transportation upgrades. Overview and Planning The Connecticut Turnpike opened to traffic in 1958, and was designed to carry 40,000 vehicles a day. By 1993, however, it was carrying over 140,000 vehicles a day, with some sources saying that figure has since ballooned to over 200,000. In October 1989, the state of Connecticut initiated a study to evaluate a 7.2-mile stretch of Interstate 95 between West Haven and Branford. This was followed by a January 1992 draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) outlining several options, which ranged from simply widening I-95 to building a light rail line to parallel I-95. Residents and officials criticized the original plan, which caused the state to go back to the drawing board. After drafting a new plan in 1997, the state released a final environmental impact statement in March 1999. Opposition to the new plan was significantly lower than the old one, and so the state continued to advance with its plans. Design sessions took place in late 1999/early 2000 and construction commenced in October 2000. The state divided the program into 25 separate contracts undertaken by 10 different construction firms in order to combat the increasing costs of labor and construction material. Construction = New Haven State Street = The first project under the program constructed the New Haven State Street train station. The station opened on June 7, 2002. = Eastern approach = The eastern approach to the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge was reconstructed and widened through two contracts, officially referred to as Contracts C1 and C2 at a total cost of $120 million. Contract C1 reconstructed the eastern approach from Lake Saltonstall through East Haven, while Contract C2 reconstructed I-95 from the East Haven/New Haven border to the eastern abutment of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. O & G Industries of Torrington, Connecticut was the primary contractor for both contracts. While a train accident, harsh weather, and several design changes delayed the completion of Contract C1 by more than a year, O & G Industries completed Contract C2 in August 2008, one year ahead of schedule. Further east, a third contract officially referred to as Contract D, reconstructed and widened I-95 from the Lake Saltonstall bridge to Exit 54 in Branford. Pittsfield, Massachusetts-based Middlesex Company was the prime contractor for the $36 million contract. Aside from resurfacing, restriping and widening from four lanes to six, no physical construction was performed on the I-95 bridge over Lake Saltonstall as it was rebuilt and widened in 1995. = Western approach and I-91/Route 34 interchange = Reconstructing the western approach to the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge was divided into several contracts: E, E1 and E2. Contract E1 involved the construction of earthworks that support the western abutment of the new bridge and carry the new ramps to I-91 and Route 34. L.G. DeFelice Construction was originally awarded the $14 million contract, but the company went out of business midway through the project. The contract was picked up and completed on schedule by Hallberg Construction in 2006. Contract E2 involved building the flyover bridge that carries the new ramp from I-95 northbound to Route 34 and added a transition lane to I-95 in each direction through Long Wharf. This contract was completed on June 6, 2011 by Walsh Construction Company of Canton, Massachusetts at a cost of $90 million. Contract E completed the remainder of the interchange ramps, bridges, and new Turnpike mainline roadways. This contract was let on April 11, 2011, and ended on November 18, 2016. =Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge construction= The first bridge contract, which included the demolition of the Yale Boathouse and the Fitch Foundry, was let in October 2006. A second contract was let on June 1, 2007, to relocate two 42-inch (1.06 meter) diameter sanitary sewer lines that lie directly beneath where part of the new bridge will be built. Construction of the new sewer lines involved slant drilling through bedrock under New Haven Harbor. The Middlesex Company, a construction contractor based in Littleton, Massachusetts, was the prime contractor on the $20 million project. The third contract, known as Contract B1 in official documents, which covers construction of the bridge abutments and pier foundations for the northbound lanes was let on October 31, 2007. Four construction firms submitted bids for this $137 million contract February 6, 2008, according to bid results from CONNDOT. The contract was awarded to a joint venture between the Middlesex Company and Pittsfield, Maine-based Cianbro Corporation in April 2008. The final contract, known as Contract B, will construct the remainder of the new bridge and demolish the existing span. Contract B was awarded to a joint venture between Walsh Construction of Chicago, Illinois and Denver, Colorado-based PCL Constructors for $417 million in July 2009. The joint venture company is also known as Walsh-PCL Joint Venture II (A previous joint venture between the two companies, known as Walsh-PCL Joint Venture I, reconstructed the Moses Wheeler Bridge in Stratford). Route 34/Downtown Crossing In a related project known as Downtown Crossing, the city of New Haven has been decommissioning the Route 34/Oak Street Connector to make way for new developments, and to reconnect Downtown New Haven's street grid. The first phase of this project was included in the New Haven Harbor Crossing Improvement Program, let on February 1, 2013, and completed on July 10, 2015. Canal Dock Boathouse Another part of the program was the construction of the Canal Dock Boathouse. The state agreed to construct the boathouse as a compromise with the city of New Haven for demolishing the historic Yale Boathouse. The boathouse construction contract was preceded by a contract to build a platform for the boathouse to sit on. This began in February 2013 and ended in October 2014. Construction on the boathouse itself began in October 2016 and ended in September 2018. West Haven to I-91/Route 34 Three separate contracts reconstructed and widened I-95 from I-91/Route 34 to Route 162 in West Haven. To the west of Long Wharf, CONNDOT replaced aging bridge over the West River and Route 10 with a wider structure through . Part of this reconstruction effort involved consolidated Exits 44 and 45 into a single interchange. Construction of the new West River Bridge occurred in a three-stage project similar to the reconstruction of the Moses Wheeler Bridge further west in Stratford. The first stage involving construction of the new northbound lanes was completed in the middle of 2015. The second stage involved shifting northbound traffic onto the new northbound span and shifting southbound traffic onto the former northbound lanes of the original bridge so the old southbound lanes could be demolished to make way for the new southbound lanes. This stage was completed in the middle of 2016, with southbound traffic shifted to the new southbound structure and the original bridge taken out of service. The final stage involves removal of the remaining original bridge and completing the center portion of the new bridge. All three stages were completed as part of a single contract, which was let on March 31, 2014, and ended on November 9, 2018. This was the final project completed under the program to date. The section of I-95 from Route 162 in West Haven to the West River featured six lanes with no shoulders prior to this construction, and has been the site of chronic congestion and numerous accidents. The reconstructed highway features full left and right-hand shoulders, and contains provisions for a future expansion to eight lanes.

Two of the first to draw attention to the development were Hsu Lan-hsiang (ÂæêËò≠È¶ô) and Lin Yunko (ÊûóÈõ≤Èñ£). Lin is an investigative journalist who'd reported on the 1997 hillside collapse of the Lincoln Mansions (ÊûóËÇØÂ§ßÈÉ°) (an apartment block) in Sijhih (Ê±êÊ≠¢) that killed 28 residents.Taipei Times: Lincoln collapse haunts Sijhih, 200 7 Subsequently, he developed an interest in inappropriate slope-land construction. According to a News Lens article, Hsu went to Taitung as a peaceful place to write, staying at a residence near Shanyuan/Fudafudak: ‚ÄúLin Yunko noticed unusual going-ons at the peaceful bay in front of him. A large security fence was erected, and workers began entering and exiting, seemingly planning to build something large.‚Äù Lin Yunko then met one of his neighbors in the region, Hsu Lan-hsian, who also had concerns about the development. Hsu, who had ‚Äúsettled in the northern Tulan village near Shanyuan Bay, looking for a pure source of water for her craft-brewed vinegar‚Äù, had been involved in environmental protests from her home county of Hsinchu, and was a member of the Taitung chapter of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU).The News Lens: Anti-Miramar activists successfully stalled opening, 2018 After discussing the issue with Lin, Hsu raised the topic at a TEPU meeting. In April 2007, the TEPU hired Lin Yun-ge as a full-time secretary to investigate the construction, report potential building violations to relevant government bodies, and write articles. = TEPU (Ëá∫ÁÅ£Áí∞Â¢É‰øùË≠∑ËÅØÁõü) = The Taitung chapter of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) was headed by Professor of Natural Sciences, Liu Jhong-si (ÂäâÁÇØÈå´) Professor of Geography Liao Chiu-er ÂªñÁßãÂ®•, and Yang Tsung-wei (Ê•äÂÆóÁ∑Ø), an ex-railway engineer and Taitung museum curator. The group originally formed to protest the joint government/private BOO Taitung Incinerator. After listening to Hsu's and Lin's concerns regarding Miramar, TEPU hired Lin as a secretary to investigate the construction and file reports with the relevant authorities. At the same time, the TEPU connected with members of the surrounding indigenous buluos, including traditional custodians, Lin Shu-ling and her mother, (Da) Panay (Lin Jing-ti ÊûóÈáëËíÇ), and Amis boat builder, Long-ge (Ë≥¥ÈÄ≤Èæç), as well as members of the Fugang, Fushan, and A'tolan buluos. Apart from organizing the earliest on-site protest gatherings, TEPU began laying a paper trail of permit violations, filing reports with the Tourism Bureau, the Urban and Rural Development Office, as well as the Central Government's Administrative Yuan's Environmental Protection Association (EPA) and the Control Yuan (Ombudsman), and having the Miramar situation raised in the Legislature (by Legislator Lin Shu-fen) in April 2007. They also participated in the Citizen Litigation suits.United News, Luo Shao-ping Chen Jia-xin, 2007 = Land division irregularities = One of the violations uncovered in TEPU's research related to a land merging- division application for the site. On February 21, 2005, Miramar representatives and officials from the Taitung County Government Tourism Bureau (renamed Urban and Rural Development Office) agreed to merge land sections 348 and 346-2 then re-divide them to create a new section, 346‚Äì4, with an area of 0.9997 hectares, which would serve as the construction base of the hotel.Prof. Liu, Taitung University, Miramar Timeline Thomas Chan: Taiwan's first case of successful EIA citizen litigation In December 2006, with the basic structure of the 5-floor building nearing completion, Miramar proposed to modify the project into three stages, taking the near-finished part as the first stage, to be followed by 2nd & 3rd construction stages. The building coverage ratio and floor to area ratio increased from 6.5% to 19.69% and 19.8% to 48.54% respectively.Timothy Chen, Imaginative geographies and state reliance: examining Taiwan's Shanyuan bay and Miramar resort 2015, P24-25 As the Taipei Times reported: \\"Although the entire resort ‚Äî including the hotel building and other facilities ‚Äî occupies an area of 59,956m2, the County Government had initially allowed the Miramar Group to divide the project site into different areas, so that no single area is more than 1 hectare because the law requires any construction project over that size to go through an EIA process.\\" Taipei Times: Demolish illegal resort: activists, 2012 = 2007 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) = On January 12, 2007, an EIA panel was commissioned to retrospectively examine the project. The panel recommended a suspension of construction and fining the company for building law violations and environmental damage. Lin Li-zhi, 2012: Exploration of the development of Taitung County Coast: The BOT development case of Miramar Resort Subsequently, Miramar/Durban was fined NT$300 000 (US$9091) for ‚Äúexceeding the specified scope of construction ‚ÄòStage 1' by the Taitung Kuang Li-chen Government, though it was maintained that the already erected 5-story structure of the resort was legal. This was done by arguing that the project should be seen as separate, evolving ‚Äústages‚Äù, with the 2nd and 3rd stages representing ‚Äòafter-thought‚Äô improvements and/or corrections to the original plan. Even though the three stages combined amounted to 5.97 hectares, the Taitung government maintained that the ‚Äòfirst stage‚Äô, if taken in isolation at the time, was only 0.99 hectares and didn't require an EIA.TEIA, Chan brands Taitung Government's refusal to withdraw permit, ‚ÄòShameless‚Äô, Oct 24, 2012 Therefore, ‚Äúaccording to the law‚Äù,Deputy Magistrate, Chang Chin-hu, News Lens, Taitung County development plan ruled illegal, 2012 a building permit was issued, making it a legally pre-constructed building, or at least \\"definitely not substantially illegal\\".

In April 2007, Lin Yunko from the Taitung TEPU traveled to Taipei for a meeting with members of Wild at Heart as well as the national arm of TEPU looking for strategic and legal input from groups experienced in dealing with environmental issues on a national level.The News Lens, Anti-Miramar activists successfully stalled opening, 2018 From that meeting, a press conference was called for April 29, where Lin Zih-lin (ÊûóÂ≠êÂáå), Secretary General of Wild at Heart, and TEPU Secretary General Hou Jhongshun ‰ΩïÂÆóÂã≥, outlined the history of the case including land division and waste disposal irregularities . Environmental lawyer Thomas Chan and Legislator Lin Shu-fen also attended. Following this meeting, the TEPU held activities on Shanyuan/Fudafudak beach and filed reports with the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), the Tourism Bureau and the Construction and Planning Agency. According to News Lens: ‚ÄúFor the first time (the Miramar protest) began to connect with a wider network of groups and gain mainstream media interest.‚Äù  First Citizen Litigation  On July 26, 2007, Wild at Heart lawyer Chen Bo-chou (Èô≥ÊüèËàü), working with input from Thomas Chan, assisted the TEPU (as plaintiffs) in launching the first Citizen Litigation, challenging the validity of Miramar's building permit on the grounds that it had been issued without having passed an EIA.Thomas Chan, Exploring the road to Citizen Litigation, 2012 On August 1, another press conference was held by Lin Zih-lin and Chen Bo-chou (Wild at Heart), legislator Lai Shin-yuan, TEPU representatives, Liu Jhong-si, Lin Yunko, and Ho Tsung-shun ‰ΩïÂÆóÂã≥, and lawyer Thomas Chan. Apart from reiterating the land division irregularities, ‚Äúthey used on-site photos to accuse Miramar of directly burying building waste on the beach, which was strongly denied by the industry‚Äù.  Construction rubble  In response, on August 16, 2007, representatives for Durban/Miramar and Taitung Council Speaker, Li Jin-hue (ÊùéÈå¶ÊÖß), invited EPA officials and the media to the site for an ‚Äúinspection and excavation.‚Äù Backhoes dug \\"ten large holes in the beach, over an approximate area of 250 square meters, but no construction waste was found.‚Äù Regarding the previously photographed rubble, a Miramar spokesperson said: ‚ÄúI am afraid it was planted.\\" KS News, Miramar claims \\"illegal violence\\" by protesters, 2012 The spokesperson also accused unnamed professors of ‚Äúdismantling a Miramar signboard by fierce means‚Äù as well as ‚Äúhindering the development of Taitung‚Äù, saying: ‚ÄúAcademics have a responsibility to display a sense of right and wrong; not to be engaging in small-minded acts. They should adopt a professorial style so people can respect the profession. Otherwise they will provoke disgust and be cast aside.‚Äù Beach erosion following Typhoon Usagi revealed remnants of the old change room facilities, 2013 Two days later, on August 18, large waves brought on by passing Typhoon Sepat revealed blocks of construction rubble on the beach at a site not excavated during the media event.Prof. Liu, Taitung University, Miramar timeline On the 28th of August, the Taitung County Industrial Development & Investment Promotion Committee (TCID&IPC;) staged a counter-protest at Taitung University, where TEPU conveners Liu Jhong-si and Liao Chiu-er worked. Members of TCID&IPC; chanted, ‚ÄúFake Taitung people get out of Taitung!‚Äù Following Typhoon Usagi in September 2013, more rubble was exposed. Miramar/Durban then agreed to remove the rubble. Legal proceedings Although the litigation process to stop Miramar evolved into a complicated series of court cases, at its core, it was straightforward. According to the then-Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act 14-1: An EIA must be conducted on any development over one hectare - before construction begins.TEIA: Thomas Chan brands Taitung Government ‚ÄòShameless‚Äô, 2012 Miramar was a structure exceeding one hectare - without having done an EIA.Taipei Times: Tourism gone wrong, 2016 The associated court proceedings continued for 8 years. = Litigation restrictions = The Taitung Government, apart from being a partner in the BOT Miramar project, was also the competent authority supervising the development. Critics such as Geography Professor, David Chang (ÂºµÈï∑Áæ©), from National Taiwan University have raised conflict of interest concerns when ‚Äúthe player acts as the referee‚Äù.Taipei Times, Critics blast project, 2012 In the case of Miramar, the TEPU, in concert with Wild at Heart Lawyer, Chen Bo-chou (Èô≥ÊüèËàü), filed reports in an attempt to initiate proceedings against Lai Ming-hsuan (Ë≥¥ÊóªÁÇ´) (Taitung Govt. head of Urban and Rural Development ) and Lo Wencheng (ÁæÖÊñáÊîø) (Urban and Rural Development technical specialist), then-County Magistrate, Kuang Li-chen, and Miramar/Durban owner, Huang Chun-fa, detailing involvement in the improper issuing of building permit documents, illegal waste disposal, sand theft (alleging sand was removed for use at a man-made beach near Taipei 101), and environmental destruction. Their evidence consisted of the relevant documents and on-site photos/video of demolition rubble, cement waste-flow, and marine- ecology impact reports. Taipei Times, Miramar broke law with Taitung project: advocates, 2007 All these reports against individual actors were terminated at the preliminary investigation stage by the Taitung Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) and/or Prosecutor's Office due to ‚Äúinsufficient evidence‚Äù. Professor of Criminal Justice, Chin Ko-lin, in his book, Heijin (Black Gold), writing about county police in Taiwan in general, reports a ‚Äúsense of powerlessness‚Äù felt by members of county CIB's: ‚ÄúA senior police officer from Taichung city revealed to me how impotent the police are when it comes to dealing with incidents involving elected representatives: ‚ÄúIn fact, we can only investigate ordinary people. If the suspects are heidao elected deputies, then it's up to the people at the upper echelons to tell us what to do. Once an incident involves a political figure, that incident becomes something that we at the police station can't do much about.‚Äù‚Äù Ko-lin Chin 2003, Heijin: Organized Crime, Business, and Politics in Taiwan, M.E. Sharpe, 2003, P187 = Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) = Much of the ensuing legal proceedings revolved around the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process. In January 2007, an EIA panel was belatedly convened to examine the development. Miramar failed to pass and the panel called for a halt to construction and for the company to be fined. Another three assessment meetings were held during 2007, but they also resulted in a failure to pass the project. On January 23, 2008, protest groups achieved their first legal victory when the Kaohsiung Administrative High Court ruled: ‚ÄúAs an EIA wasn't conducted prior to construction, therefore, according to the EIA Act Article.14.4, the building permit issued by the defendant (Taitung County Government) is invalid.‚Äù The Taitung Government was thus ordered to halt construction and pay all associated legal fees. Whereas protesters argued that this meant Miramar would need to be demolished before any reapplication for an EIA could be considered,Taipei Times, Stop Miramar resort: environmental groups, 2013 Taitung Government and Miramar representatives categorized the decision as merely reflecting ‚Äúmissteps ... during the construction process‚Äù,Timothy Chen, Imaginative landscapes and state reliance, 2015 which could be remedied by retrospectively conducting an EIA. The 2008 EIA Despite setbacks with previous EIA's, opportunities arose to rotate the panel. Taipei Times reported Professor Chang (ÂºµÈï∑Áæ©), a member of the original 2007 EIA, as saying, ‚ÄúMost members who had expressed concern or rejected the project have been removed ...by the local government.‚Äù Taipei Times, Academics blast resort project, 2012 According to a News Lens report: \\"EIA members were replaced by county officials and engineering academics, while those from the fields of ecology, geography, and social science were not chosen.\\" News Lens, Protesters stall Miramar opening, 2018 The newly appointed EIA panelists included: County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen, Deputy-Magistrate, Pong De-chen (convener and panel member), Chief of Taitung Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), Huang Ming-en, Chief of Agriculture, Liao Fu-shan, and Chief of Urban and Rural Development Bureau, Hsu Shi-yuan. On June 15, 2008, this panel voted to approve Miramar's EIA, allowing construction to continue. The Taitung Government argued that this EIA approval rendered the High Court ruling redundant, and construction resumed. Following this development, a Citizen Litigation petition was lodged on behalf of the TEPU by Wild at Heart lawyer Chen Bo-chou, alleging the EIA was invalid due to excessive representation by Taitung Government officials. This petition was rejected by the Taitung Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB). = The Charges against the Taitung Government = The primary suit against the Taitung County Government challenged the legality of the EIA. Chan introduced arguments related to indigenous rights, environmental damage, and dereliction of duty by the \\"competent authority\\", noting that: \\"According to the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 5: \\"The person in charge of the department shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years‚Äù\\". Thomas Chan: Taiwan's first case of successful EIA citizen litigation, 2012 However, the point that gained the most legal traction was that in joint government/private BOT or BOO projects, ‚Äúmembers of the target business shall abstain from voting\\" due to conflict of interest concerns. According to Chan's prosecution: ‚ÄúA total of 9 members attended the 5th Review Meeting of the EIA Committee. Among them, four were government officials. They should have abstained from voting in accordance with the above provisions, but didn't. Once these ineligible members are deducted, then only 5 members were present, less than the quorum of 8 (at least half of all members). According to Article 7(1) of the Organizational Procedures, without a quorum, the EIA resolution is invalid.‚Äù \\"After fierce arguments between the two sides\\", on August 10, 2009, (the Administrative High) court decided to adopt the author's opinion\\" and declared the EIA invalid.Prof. Liu Jhong-si, Taitung University, Miramar timeline A secondary suit followed on from this finding: as a building permit cannot be issued without first obtaining an EIA, and the EIA had been declared invalid, therefore the building permit was likewise invalidated. = Government/Miramar response to 2008 EIA court verdicts = With the Miramar case categorized as ‚Äúa precedent-setting one for the overall development of Taiwan's east coast (Lin 2012)‚Äù Lin 2012, referenced by Timothy Chen, Imaginative geographies, 2013, p26Taipei Times, Lines in the Sand, 2013 the Taitung Government, backed by their own team of lawyers, were determined to fight on. As Justin Huang argued: ‚ÄúEven though the result of the EIA was invalidated by the administrative court (later the Supreme Court), it doesn't affect the validity of the building permit which had already been issued.‚Äù Justin Huang, Dare to be Different; the growing story of Justin Huang and Taitung, 2013, P.173 In September 2009, the Taitung Government, under outgoing Magistrate Kuang Li-chen, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. On Oct 9, however, Kuang ‚Äúraised political eyebrows when she announced ‚Ä¶ she was giving up her reelection bid‚Äù (for the upcoming November poll) to make way for Justin Huang.Taipei Times, KMT picks Kuang for Taitung race, Nov 11, 2009 In a direct swap, Kuang Li-chen was then endorsed as the KMT candidate for the by- election to fill Huang's vacated Taitung Legislative seat.

With the then court rulings relating to the old permit, it argued the new permit rendered the results of previous cases irrelevant. = Fan Fan Fan (ÂèçÂèçÂèç) = Fan Fan Fan (Ban Ban Ban), which formed in early 2011, was an anti-Miramar activist group composed mostly of local artists. They staged exhibitions, rallies, and concerts. As part of efforts by TEPU, the Taitung Environmental Information Association (TEIA), the Taitung Anti-Nuclear Alliance, and Lin Shu-ling to raise awareness of the case, a public meeting was held at the old Tulan Sugar Factory, which had become a base for local artists.Lonely Planet, Dulan Sugar Factory Lin Shu-ling recalled: \\"A lot of artists were uncomfortable with the Miramar development, but they hadn't gotten together.\\" From this meeting, described as ‚Äúa significant turning point‚Äù, indigenous folk singers such as Panai, Nabu, and Takanow became involved, as well as artists Rao Ai-ching, Yi-ming, Hsiau-hwa, Eleng, Dou-dou, Hana, Jen-wei, A-pei, Yu-wen and several others. As a result, the group Fan Fan Fan was formed with Takanow acting as chairperson. Their contacts (particularly Panai's) in the music and arts communities across Taiwan would contribute to ‚Äúheavyweights from all walks of life showing solidarity with the anti-Miramar movement.‚Äù Lawyer Hsu Chia-jung (Ë®±ÂòâËìâ), also from Primordial Law, worked with Thomas Chan on the Miramar case. She observed that legal proceedings necessarily focus on complex points of law, meaning indigenous, environmental, and economic topics were unable to be discussed freely in court, so groups like FFF added another dimension. ‚ÄúOne is passion, the other is rationality; the Miramar case was built on cooperation between the two.‚Äù = 2011 Camp-in and concert on Shanyuan/Fudafudak = Driftwood artist Yi- ming working on 'taluan' at Miramar camp-in protest, 2011 In June 2011, FFF members began a month-long camp-in on Shanyuan/Fudafudak beach. Local indigenous driftwood artists, including Yi-ming, Eleng, and Dou Dou, oversaw the building of a taluan (traditional shelter made from driftwood, bamboo, and palm fronds), which served as a base camp, exhibition space, and counterpoint structure. Yahoo News, 1000 people hold hands to guard beach, July 11, 2011 The camp-in, which emphasized the indigenous land rights aspect of the case, culminated in a rally led by Nabu (Bunun tribe) supported by ‚Äúabout 20 civic groups‚Äù,Taipei Times, Aborigines continue to protest against new hotel, 2011 as well as a concert on July 9, featuring indigenous musicians including Matzka (Ê®ÇÂúò), Lung-ko (ÈæçÂì•), Takanow (ÈÅîÂç°È¨ß), Siki and Shan Shan, and Panai (Â∑¥Â•à), as well as Taiwan indie acts The Chairman (Ëë£‰∫ãÈï∑Ê®ÇÂúò) and Kao Chou-chin (Êã∑ÁßãÂã§). An estimated 1000 people attended, elevating the protest to the level of a national movement. = Miramar opening = Upon the issuing of the revised building permit, work resumed. ‚ÄúWith construction almost complete‚Äù, consortium representatives began projecting an opening date. According to a Focus Taiwan article in September 2011: ‚ÄúWith only five months to go before a massive resort opens ‚Ä¶ many activists acknowledge that it is probably impossible to stop (it) at this point. Lin Shu-ling, 33, a leader of the protest movement and a member of the Erythrina Tribe (Tse-tung buluo), vows to continue: \\"We'll still stand in front of the hotel and protest, and try to maintain our camp-in on the beach.\\" Focus Taiwan, CNA, As Taitung resort opening nears, protesters ponder future strategy, Sep 6, 2011 = Supreme Court Verdict 2008 EIA = On January 19, 2012, the Supreme Court upheld previous rulings, reaffirming that there were only 5 eligible members in attendance, which was less than the quorum of 8, in which case the resolution was invalid.Taipei Times, Court orders construction on Meiliwan (Miramar) resort stopped, Jan 21, 2012 On Jan 20, 2012 TEPU held a press conference on the beach in front of Miramar calling for ‚Äúthe building to be demolished and the environmental damage to be repaired‚Äù. Focus Taiwan, CNA, Taitung Government loses lawsuit on beach resort project, Jan 21, 2012 On Feb 23, a subsequent Administrative High Court order was issued for construction to be stopped. By that time, the resort was virtually complete. Huang argued, \\"Today, the situation is that the main structure has been completed long ago. It's very easy to just oppose it, but what should the government do? We must solve the issue according to law.

In July 2013, the Administrative High Court ordered a halt to construction pending the outcome of the case challenging the 2012 EIA, which was announced on October 28 when the Administrative High Court ruled it invalid. Using the same maths as with the 2008 EIA, the judges found that when the three government department heads were subtracted from the vote, there were only five eligible members, which was under the required quorum of 8.Taipei Times, Ecologist cheer Miramar ruling, April 2, 2016Taipei Times editorial, Miramar resort: tourism gone wrong, April 2, 2016 Waiting until the final day of allowable time, the Taitung Government filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, with Chen Chin-hu saying, ‚ÄúWe didn't enclose any legal arguments for the appeal in our submission.

She stated, ‚ÄúThe county government has approved two EIA reports by the company; both were revoked by judges. It should get the judges‚Äô messages through its head.‚Äù Thomas Chan also argued that the central government had let the BOT project run out of control. ‚ÄúIt's embarrassing that the central administrative organs have first set fires (by allowing the Taitung government to act as competent authority), and this makes it impossible to correct the fire lighting behavior of the local government, who follow their example.‚Äù More than two years later, on March 31, 2016, the Administrative Supreme Court dismissed the Taitung government's final appeal and barred Miramar from opening. The decision could not be appealed. By that time, the Taitung Government had lost 10 straight cases. No court proceedings have been held to decide whether Miramar should be demolished. Miramar's compensation claim One of the main arguments for allowing the resort to open was the threat of Miramar suing if it was blocked. In 2011 Magistrate Huang said: \\"We'd not only lose our investment, we'd definitely be sued by Miramar in court.‚Äù Focus Taiwan, CNA, As Taitung resort opening nears, protesters ponder future strategy, Sep 6, 2011 Thomas Chan, dismissed this as a \\"scare tactic‚Äù, noting that ‚ÄúThe developers ...violated the law by beginning construction before applying for EIA approval, thereby voiding any compensation claim‚Äù. Life News, Miramar announces appeal on final day, Chan says compensation is scare tactic, Dec 2, 2014 In late 2014, following Miramar/Taitung government's eighth court loss, Huang shifted focus to an internal resolution: ‚ÄúThe just outcome of this EIA resolution was denied by the verdicts of the courts. As a result, we have no idea what to do. Ensuring the rights of the Taitung people is the first thing to consider, but given the company has spent more than NT$1 billion on the project, it is impossible to just accept this loss and walk away, leaving the resort to stand idle on the beach forever. As such, the Taitung Government is psychologically prepared to face the consequences of a compensation request for terminating the contract, just like the Taitung Incinerator.‚Äù Storm Media, Miramar case: Taitung government files appeal Dec 1, 2104 (In 2011, the Build Operate Own (BOO) builders of the ‚Äúmothballed‚Äù Taitung Incinerator were controversially granted a compensation payout of NT$1.96 billion as a result of a dispute resolution tribunal convened by Huang government Secretary General, Chen Chin-hu (Èô≥ÈáëËôé)).Vision, United Daily News, Taitung Incinerator failed to burn one day of garbage 10 years after completion, Aug 15, 2015Lih-Ren Liu, Yuh-Ming Lee,Remedial Measures for Erroneous Environmental Policies: Assessing Infrastructure Projects of Waste-to-Energy Incineration in Taiwan with a Case Study of the Taitung Incinerator, 2016, p8 On August 13, 2018, Miramar deputy manager Lin Hung-che (ÊûóÂºòÂì≤) announced ‚Äúa request for arbitration.‚Äù According to a Taipei Times report: ‚ÄúMiramar Resort Hotel Co has demanded NT$1.2 billion (US$39.08 million) from the Taitung County Government in compensation for repeated delays in the construction.‚Äù = Dispute resolution tribunal = An arbitration tribunal is composed of the two disputant parties and a mediator.

Life and career Juan Gonz√°lez was born in Camaguey, Cuba, in 1942. He spent his early life in Cuba until fleeing to the United States in 1961 as a part of the Cuban exile resulting from the Cuban Revolution. Gonz√°lez resided in Miami with other exiled Cuban artists and earned his Masters of Fine Arts from the University of Miami in 1972. That year also saw Gonz√°lez relocate permanently to New York City following a successful solo exhibition at the Allan Stone Gallery and a group exhibition at Whitney Museum of American Art. It was his former Coral Gables studio that had been converted into the Permuy Gallery, among the first Cuban art galleries, with which he maintained a relationship and occasionally exhibited in.https://communitynewspapers.com/featured/gables-architecture-firm-combines- holiday-party-with-art-exhibition/ Gonz√°lez had another highly successful exhibition in 1975 at the Nancy Hoffman Gallery, which subsequently went on to manage and represent him in New York for the rest of his career. Throughout the rest of his career, Gonz√°lez would continue to see his international profile rise as he participated in several solo and group exhibitions, win prominent awards, and have his works added to the permanent collection of renown institutions. He also maintained significant ties to the emerging South Florida art market through his ex-wife, Josefina Camacho, and her second husband Marcos Pinedo, who would become major fine art collectors and dealers in the area. The Pinedos would often represent Gonz√°lez in South Florida and through them he participated in the landmark \\"Miami Generation\\" exhibition that gave that movement of Cuban art its name and helped solidify the region's growing status in international fine art. Gonz√°lez would become one of the Miami Generation's most recognizable figures. Later in the decade he also designed elaborate sets in New York for two plays by famed Spanish poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, \\"Blood Wedding\\" (1988) and \\"As Soon as Five Years Pass\\" (1991), and also taught and lectured at the New York School of Visual Arts for nearly twenty years. Gonz√°lez died in 1993 in New York City of complications stemming from AIDS. His work was the subject of the 1980 book Juan Gonz√°lez: A Twentieth Century Baroque Painter (republished in 1991) as well as an in-depth, career-spanning retrospective book, Dreamscapes: The Art of Juan Gonzalez, by Irene McManus, which was published by Hudson Hills Press on the year of his death. Style Gonz√°lez in known for creating paintings and collages that ranged from realism to surrealism and fantasy. His themes and subject matter included religion, reinterpreted scenes from art history, portraits of family and friends, and psychologically introspective expressions of identity (via self-portraits) and his struggle with AIDS. His works were characterized by their rich detail, lifelike realism, and symbolism.

Overview The site is located approximately 5 kilometers north-east of the city of Kashiwazaki, approximately at the center of a small marshy plain behind the dunes along the Sea of Japan coast. It contains the ruins of a village from in the middle of the Yayoi period (approximately 2000 years ago), which was excavated by the Niigata Prefectural Board of Education from 1977-1978. Six unique circular pit dwellings were discovered, which had a diameter of five to nine meters surrounding a central hearth. Each building was surrounded by a ditch 10 to 15 meters in diameter for drainage. Another rectangular structures were identified. In addition, the site had approximately 160 mounds in various shapes: circular, elliptical, and square arranged in two rows, which seem to have been used for various purposes. Some were grave tumuli containing the remains of wooden coffins, and others appeared to be used for storage. The village appeared to be a mass-production center for jadeite round and cylindrical beads, mortar balls and sling balls, and numerous items in the intermediate stages of production were also found. In addition, numerous examples of Yayoi period earthenware were found, including pots for storage and pots for cooking. The style was mostly with a combed design common throughout the Hokuriku region, but there were also a large number of pieces from Shinano Province, indicating long-distance trade. Rice paddies were not discovered at the site, but a large amount of carbonized rice and stone sickles for harvesting rice were excavated, indicating that rice cultivation exist din the area.

The Dutch Renaissance style main building was built in 1579 for Chancellor of the Realm Eiler Grubbe (1532‚Äì1585). In the late 1600s, the main building was rebuilt and a new south wing was erected. History =Godov family= Lystrup was created when the farms in a village by the same name was merged into a single manor. It is first mentioned in 1403 when it belonged to Olsen Godo. After Oluf Pedersen Godov's death, it was passed on to his daughter Regitse Olufdatter Godov. She was married to Palle Andersen Ulfeldt. =Grubbe family= Their daughter, Mette Ulfeldt, married Sivert Grubbe. He was one of the signatories of the act that instituted Protestantism in Denmark in 1536, Grubbe had many children. One of his sons, J√∏rgen Grubbe fell into captivity in Turkey and later settled in East Prussia. Another son disappeared abroad. When Grubbe died in 1559, Lystrup was therefore passed on to his youngest son, Eiler Grubbe (1532‚Äì1585), who had served as secretary at Crown Prince Frederick's court in Malm√∂hus. He married Else Laxmand in 1559. He was appointed to treasurer (rentemester) in 1560 and Chancellor of the Realm in 1570. After Eiler Grubbe's death in 1585, Lystrup was passed to his son Christian Grubbe. He led a quiet life on his estate without offices at the court and did not marry until the age of 37. His son, Peder Grubbe, who served in the Torstenson War (1643-1645), inherited Lystrup after his father. He had to sell some of his estates but kept Lystrup. After his death, it was passed to his son T√∏nne Grubbe (1651-1721). He was rather unstable and for a while imprisoned at Kastelle in Copenhagen. He married Wilhelmine Hedevig von Winsheim (1659-1710) but the couple had no children. He died in 1721 at the age of 70 as the last member of the Grubbe family in Denmark. =Changing owners= A few years prior to his death, T√∏nne Grubbe had endowed Lystrup to Claus Bendix Beenfeldt who was married to Christine Cathrine Statlander, a niece of Grubbe's late wife. He was an army officer but was dismissed after the end of the Great Northern War in 1720. The family then settled on the Lystrup estate. In 1740, he also acquired neighbouring estate at Jomfruens Egede north-west of Faxe. Claus Bendix Beenfeldt had two daughters, Anna Vilhelmine Beenfeldt (1720-1775) and Christine Ulrikke Beenfeldt (1723-1781). Anne Vilhelmine Beenfeldt married Christian Holmsted (1715-1754) while her sister married his twin brother Thomas Holmsted (1715-1773). In 1750, Claus Bendix Beenfeldt ceded Lystrup to Christian Holmsted and Jomfruens Egede to Thomas Holmsted. After Christian Holmsted's early death in 1754, Anna Vilhelmine Beenfeldt married Niels Rosenkrantz von Holstein-Rathlou. When Anna Vilhelmine Beenfeldt died in 1775, he then married her sister, Christine Ulrikke Beenfeldt, who had become a widow a couple of years earlier. After Niels Rosenkrantz von Holstein-Rathlou's death in 1786, Lystrup was passed to Christian Frederik von Holstein-Rathlou (1758-1828), his son by Anna Vilhelmine Beenfeldt. =Mylius family= Christian Frederik von Holstein-Rathlou's son-in-law, Johan Caspar Mylius (1776-1852) purchased the estate in 1831. He was already the owner of a number of other estates. After his death in 1852, it was endowed to his eldest son, Johan Jacob Mylius (1816-1857). After his death in 1857, Lystrup was passed on to his brother, Frederik Vilhelm de Mylius, who sold it. =Moltke family= Lystrup depicted by Ferdinand Richard in 1861 The new owner was Carl Henrik Moltke (1833‚Äì1918). He renovated the main building and lived there until his death. Lystrup was after his death in 1918 passed on to his son Aage Molkte (1866-1943). The estate is still owned by members of his family. Today Lystrup Manor covers 340 hectares of land. Lystrup and Jomfruens Egede have a total area of 1304 hectares (1998) of which 849.7 is farmland, 34.3 hectares is pastures and 487 hectares is woodland.

It maintains links with and has inspired similar formations in the United States. Meetings held by the organisation have been met with significant protest by anti-fascist activists and have been infiltrated by journalists. Anti-fascist groups such as Searchlight and Hope not Hate have included the group in their research on far-right politics in the United Kingdom. History and ideology The London Forum emerged in 2011 as a split from the New Right, a series of far-right meetings in London which took place in the 2000s. It describes itself as \\"the home of the UK alt-right\\"; Searchlight says the group bridges \\"the fascist and Tory right\\". Board of Deputies of British Jews vice-president, Jonathan Arkush, described the group as white supremacist. Forum organiser Stead Steadman told The Independent that while the group is not \\"credally defined\\", it opposes \\"globalism, cultural and non-cultural Marxism\\" and supports \\"white ethnicity and its civilisation, liberty of expression, and religious tradition\\". The group has told BBC News: \\"The London Forum comprises a range of people who care about their country and its demographic future and who wish to register their disagreement with the nigh ubiquitous enforced agenda of multiracialism and multiculturalism that threatens to destroy our identity irreversibly.\\" Hope not Hate says the group's \\"ideological fluidity\\" allows the hosting of \\"speakers from across the British and international far right. Because of this, it has links to almost every active far-right organisation in the UK, as well as many across Europe and North America\\". The group's events bring together neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers, alt-right students and antisemitic conspiracy theorists and former British National Party (BNP) activists. The group says \\"Zionism, the role of Israel in international affairs and the influence of the Jewish Diaspora upon culture and politics\\" are \\"legitimate subjects for discussion\\". The Forum is said to be \\"one of the organising hubs\\" for the far-right in Britain today, with Jeremy Bedford-Turner (a self-described fascist more commonly known as Jez Turner) as one of its leading figureheads. Regarding the Forum, he said that the far-right \\"aimed for the football hooligans, for elements who weren't really into intellectual thinking. I realised this was a mistake ... There was a definite need for a leadership cadre, for a new intelligentsia, for a new mass media\\". Following a judicial review brought to the on the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) from the Campaign Against Antisemitism, Turner was arrested in May 2018 for incitement to racial hatred following an antisemitic speech made in July 2015 in which Turner repeated blood libel accusations against Jews and said called upon anti-Shomrim protesters gathered outside Downing Street to \\"free England from Jewish control\\". In February 2017, Hope not Hate's annual report on the state of the far-right warned that the London Forum was expanding rapidly and helping the alt-right to become globalised. However, following a year-long expos√© on the far-right by Patrik Hermansson and legal difficulties faced by the group face later on that year, the London branch did not hold events since May 2017, although regional branches have continued. Prominent speakers and events =Speakers= Prominent Forum speakers have included Holocaust deniers Pedro Varela Geiss, Mark Weber and David Irving; British neo-Nazi and National Front activist Richard Edmonds; founder of proscribed terrorist organisation National Action, and Jason Reza- Jorjani from Arktos Media and as Richard Miller, a barrister who was barred from practising after expressing his admiration for Adolf Hitler. American neo-Nazi Matthew Heimbach addressed the Forum via video link in 2018 as he was denied entry to the UK to speak at the British Renaissance event in Southport, organised by Jez Turner and disgraced former UKIP Parliamentary candidate Jack Sen. Sen, who spoke at the London Forum in June 2015, had previously been suspended from UKIP after sending an allegedly anti-Semitic tweet to Liverpool Wavertree Labour candidate Luciana Berger. YouTube personality Colin Robertson (Millennial Woes) gave a film talk on Withnail and I at the forum, arguing that the film is a politically incorrect statement against the alleged cultural degeneracy of the modern day. His analysis was described by James Poulter in Vice News as a far-right analogue to the Marxist and Hegelian film analyses of Slovenian philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. Finnish nationalist Kai Murros called in the Forum for a violent fascist revolution, which would involve brigades of masked blackshirts \\"storming universities and dragging academics out into the streets\\"; white nationalist Greg Johnson called the Forum \\"the most important organisation in the British nationalist scene after the collapse of the British National Party and the subsequent wave of party fatigue\\". =2015 meeting= With the help of Searchlight, the 2015 meeting by the group at the Grosvenor Hotel was infiltrated by Mail on Sunday reporters. Searchlight editor and publisher Gerry Gable said the event was \\"the biggest and most significant meeting of Holocaust deniers that Britain has ever seen\\". Participants in the gathering were not told its exact location; they met at the nearby railway station and were escorted individually and in pairs to the hotel by former private school art teacher Michael Woodbridge, who was carrying a book by British Union of Fascists leader Oswald Mosley and wore a lapel pin with the BUF logo. Members laughed at the mention of \\"ashes rising from the death camps' crematoria\\" in Auschwitz; applauded a speaker who talked of destroying \\"Jewish-Zionist domination\\"; mocked the Charlie Hebdo massacre, describing an African leader at its ceremony as \\"some Negro\\" and cheered at the mention of a brigade of Spanish Nazi-aligned Fascists. The headline speaker at the event was Spanish Nazi sympathizer Pedro Varela, who referred to children of mixed-race parentage as \\"blackos\\" and described same-sex parents as \\"making a monster family\\". The Mail on Sunday photographed former senior members of the BNP and National Front (NF) in attendance, including Martin Webster, John Morse and Derek Beackon.

Description Brachythecium velutinum forming a dense mat. Brachythecium rivulare with prosenchymatous leaf cells. The family consists of pleurocarpous mosses with very diverse appearances. They are irregular or pinnately branched and form loose mats. The leaves are broad ovate or triangular and are sharply focused at the top. A midrib is always present and usually reaches more than half of the leaf. The leaf cells are prosenchymatous and are many times longer than wide and interlocking with pointed ends. The sporophyte consists of a regularly formed spore capsule that stands straight on the setae. The spores are distributed through an annular peristome, which is closed off by a beak-shaped operculum in immature plants. Habitat Species are terrestrial, epiphytic, or lithophytic plants that are distributed around the world. They grow on various substrates, including rock, bark, and soil. Taxonomy Brachytheciaceae is in the order Hypnales. They are a sister group of the Meteoriaceae.

Overview According to halakha, there are certain activities prohibited on Shabbat. Some Jewish communities sound a converted civil defense siren on Friday afternoon to announce that Shabbat will begin in order to warn and remind the local Jewish residents to stop doing such activities. In Jerusalem, the siren goes off 40 minutes before Shabbat. In other areas, including Brooklyn, the siren is sounded twice, once 15 minutes before Shabbat and a second time immediately before the start of shabbos. History The Talmud (Shabbat 35b) relates that on the eve of Shabbat, six shofar blasts (two series of Teki‚Äôa-Teru‚Äôa-Teki‚Äôa blows) were sounded to announce that Shabbat was approaching. Each blast represented a different act done to prepare for shabbos. The first blast told the workers in the fields to cease working and to return to the city to prepare for shabbos. The second blast told shops and inns in the city to close their stores for shabbos. The third shofar blow told the people of the city that it was time to light the shabbos candles. The last shofar blows told the people that it was the instant before shabbos. After the onset of shabbos the blower had to cease blowing and release the shofar because it is forbidden to blow shofar on shabbos or to even hold the shofar (mukzah). Rabbi Yaakov Chaim Sofer writes that this custom should be continued in a place where the Jewish populance is in control and unafraid of gentile repercussions. If an actual shofar cannot be used, a siren or bell can be used in its place. Excavations of the kosel wall after the Six-Day War revealed a stone platform on the top of the southwest corner of the outer section of the wall. This platform was the place where the shofar blower would stand in temple times as shown from an inscription on the rock that says \\"the place of the trumpeter\\". Criticism Many residents of Brooklyn neighborhoods that have such a siren have complained that the noise produced by the siren is too loud. One siren atop a synagogue in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn has been said to reach 106 decibels. In response to complaints from local residents, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection issued five noise code violation summonses to Yeshiva Toras Emes, a yeshiva located in Brooklyn that has such a siren. The Jewish residents protest this opposition, countering with the seeming acceptance of mosque's call to prayer's which take place at sunrise, and which reach similar levels of noise.

Early life and education  Haggard was born in Seattle, Washington, the fifth of eight children, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico at 6 months of age. Haggard's father was a mathematician and college professor. Her mother trained as biologist and owns a native plant nursery in Santa Fe. She studied at St. John's College, receiving a Bachelors of Arts in philosophy and mathematics in May 1995. She became fascinated by orbital mechanics after reading Newton's Principia and realizing that mathematical equations could describe the orbits of planets. In 2004, Haggard received a Master of Science in Physics from San Francisco State University, where studied X-ray-emitting binary stars in the globular cluster Omega Centauri. She received a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of Washington in 2010. Her thesis work focused on active galactic nuclei (accreting supermassive black holes at the center of distant galaxies).  Career  After completing her Ph.D., Haggard accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) at Northwestern University. She spent one year as an Assistant Professor of Astronomy in the Physics and Astronomy Department at Amherst College, before accepting an Assistant Professor position at McGill University and joining the newly-formed McGill Space Institute in 2015. Daryl Haggard's research group uses radio, submillimeter, near infrared, and X-ray telescopes to study compact objects, including active galactic nuclei, Sagittarius A* (the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy) and the mergers of neutron stars. In 2017, she led a team that used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to detect the afterglow of the merger of two neutron stars, GW170817, the first detection of X-rays from a gravitational wave source. Follow-up observations of the merger remnant by Haggard's group in 2017 showed the remnant grew brighter, rather than dimming, as expected. The remnant finally began to fade in X-ray observations taken in 2018, 260 days after the merger. She is currently a member of the Canadian Joint Committee on Space Astronomy, the Event Horizon Telescope Multiwavelength Coordination Team and the Thirty Meter Telescope International Science Development Team. Haggard had also served on the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Governance Task Force, was the editor of the AASWOMEN Newsletter and was elected a member of the AAS High Energy Astrophysics Division (HEAD) Executive Committee.

It was written by Malorie Blackman and executive producer Chris Chibnall, and directed by Mark Tonderai, and was first broadcast on BBC One on 21 October 2018. In the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Jodie Whittaker), and her human friends Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill), arrive in Alabama in 1955, and find themselves seeking to stop time-travelling criminal Krasko (Joshua Bowman) from preventing Rosa Parks (Vinette Robinson) influencing the American civil rights movement during the Montgomery bus boycott. The episode's plot concerns racial segregation in the United States at the time, including the law upheld in Alabama regarding municipal transit during this period. The closing credits of \\"Rosa\\" were played out with the single \\"Rise Up\\" by Andra Day, making it one of few episodes in the programme's history not to end with the traditional closing theme. The episode was watched by 8.41 million viewers, and received positive reviews from critics.  Plot  \\"Rosa\\" centers on Rosa Parks' historic refusal to give up her seat on a segregated bus in 1955. When the Thirteenth Doctor attempts to return to present-day Sheffield, the TARDIS instead brings her and her friends to Montgomery, Alabama in 1955. Before attempting to leave, the Doctor finds that there are traces of artron energy in the area from another time travel device. Deciding to investigate, the group learn that they have arrived the day before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat as bus driver James F. Blake demanded on 1 December, effectively influencing the civil rights movement. Tracing the energy, the group locate a suitcase of equipment from the future, but are unable to learn more when they are forced to flee when its owner attempts to hit them with a time displacement device. The Doctor suspects he is trying to alter Parks' history. Leaving her friends to research everything behind the critical moment on 1 December, the Doctor returns to examine the suitcase's contents, before using it to shield herself from its owner ‚Äî a rehabilitated mass murderer named Krasko. The Doctor learns that Krasko seeks to prevent the Montgomery bus boycott from occurring, but cannot simply kill Parks, since his neural implants prevent him from killing any living being. The Doctor is unable to convince him to abandon his plan, despite taking his time displacement device and destroying his vortex manipulator. When the Doctor learns that Krasko had arranged for Blake to take the day off, she and her friends focus on keeping history on track despite Krasko working to counter their efforts. Ryan encounters Krasko blocking the bus route with a car after removing false notices at bus stops, learning that Krasko succeeded in keeping the bus from reaching its passenger quota. Ryan learns that Krasko's actions are motivated by his deeply racist views, and uses the criminal's own displacement device to send him into the past to stop him completely. Removing the blockade, he and the others rejoin the Doctor on the bus as passengers before reaching Empire Theater. As the moment arrives, the Doctor realises they have become integral to events, and is forced to keep them aboard the bus. After witnessing Parks being arrested by the police for violating segregation laws, the group return to the TARDIS where the Doctor shows them the impact Rosa has had on history, leading to an asteroid being named in her honor in the future. = Continuity = The prison of Stormcage, mentioned in \\"Rosa\\" when the Thirteenth Doctor recognises a tattoo on the arm of Krasko, was featured in episodes of the Eleventh Doctor, primarily as the place where River Song serves time for the \\"murder\\" of her husband.

The wife of an Attican pharmacist and the mother of seven children, Karagianni worked to coordinate Greek resistance cells and their activities against the occupying Axis forces. Captured and tortured by the Germans in 1944, Karagianni was sent to Haidari concentration camp, where she continued to organize a resistance against the Germans. She was executed by firing squad on 8 September 1944.  Biography  Lela Karagianni was born in Limni, Euboea. Prior to World War II, Karagianni was a housewife in Athens. Her husband was a pharmacist, and the couple together had seven children. When the Axis powers invaded and occupied Greece in 1941, the Karagiannis provided medicine to retreating British soldiers, and later helped some stranded soldiers escape the country. As the occupation continued, the family grew increasingly involved in the burgeoning resistance movement against the-then Italian occupiers of Athens; this eventually resulted in the Lela, her husband, and her older sons joining the National Republican Greek League, commonly known by its Greek acronym EDES. Lela formed her own cell within the wider movement, code-named \\"Bouboulina\\" in reference to Laskarina Bouboulina, a female Greek captain who had fought against the Ottoman Empire during the Greek War of Independence. Karagianni and her fellow partisans operated out of her husband's pharmacy in Athens and from a monastery in Megara. The cell distributed information to other cells, smuggled wanted individuals into areas controlled by Greek partisan forces, and forged documents, and coordinated with British military intelligence to disrupt the Axis occupation. In July 1944, Karagianni was arrested in Athens by the German occupation forces. She was taken to the SS headquarters on Merlin Street, known to some Greek prisoners as \\"Hell House\\".

Officially starting with Liu Yu's usurpation of the Jin throne and creation of his Liu Song dynasty in 420, it ended in 589 with the Sui dynasty's conquest of Chen dynasty and reunification of China. The first of the Northern dynasties did not however begin in 420, but in 386 with the creation of Northern Wei. Thus there is some unofficial overlap with the era of the Sixteen Kingdoms. Organization Northern dynasties soldier Northern dynasties shieldbearer =South= During the Eastern Jin period, the army relied on a system of hereditary military households for recruitment. However, having lost the resources of the north, the Eastern Jin army attempted to bolster the number of military families in the south by incorporating convicts, vagrants, and aboriginals. This resulted in a general decline of social status and morale in the military. By the end of the dynasty, military men were regarded little better than government slaves. Terms of service were exceedingly harsh. One in three men from a military family was called upon for a term of service lasting from the age of 15 to their 60s. Essentially their entire life. Those who suffered debilitating injuries had to find a replacement from their family to procure release. Desertion was rampant and exit from the military household system a much sought after reward. By the sixth century the system of hereditary military households had collapsed. During the Liu Song dynasty, voluntary recruits began to supplant the defunct military caste system. Many of these soldiers were former members of the previous system who had been freed, and had chosen to re-enlist for better terms, or because they could find no better employment. In practice, many of the military communities which had sprung up during the era of hereditary troops stayed together, and provided the basis for recruitment for the next dynasty. By the Liang and Chen dynasties, voluntary recruits had become the dominant component of the military. Commoners were sometimes called up during times of special need, however their service was generally relegated to labor or logistical duties. Military commanders of the time had little faith in their fighting ability. =North= After Northern Wei shifted its capital to Luoyang, the lower class Xianbei were registered as \\"garrison households\\". These functioned similarly to the southern hereditary military households and were used for frontier garrison posts. They were excluded from the formal ranking system. After the collapse of Northern Wei, the Eastern Wei regime absorbed the greater portion of North Asian warriors and preferred to deploy them over the Han Chinese. The Western regime lacked the manpower to forego Han Chinese recruits and made significant use of them in their campaigns. =Fubing= In 550, Western Wei created the Twenty-four Armies, the predecessor of the fubing system, which formed the basis of military recruitment in the Sui dynasty and early Tang dynasty. The primary significance of the Twenty-four Armies was that Yuwen Tai had managed to bolster his forces to a size far beyond what he originally started with. From 50,000 men in 550, the Twenty-four Armies had doubled in size by 570. It's not certain how this happened and the specifics are still a source of contention. The general view is that to create the Twenty-four Armies, the Western Wei government implemented a system of mass recruitment. However, unlike the conscription of the Han dynasty, this time the government provided new incentives by removing the names of recruits from the household registers. This meant that they were effectively free from normal tax and labor obligations. It was said that \\"after this half the Chinese became soldiers\\". The utilization of Chinese troops eventually led to the triumph of Northern Zhou over Southern Qi. Despite having a larger population base, the eastern Xianbei elite hailed from the northern garrisons which opposed sinicizing policies at the capital. They treated the Chinese with disdain and distrust, refusing to incorporate them into their military structure. The Chinese population reciprocated this sentiment and did little to help their overlords in times of need. In the west, the Xianbei had no choice but to rely upon not just the Chinese, but also the Qiang, for they lacked the numbers to stand up to their eastern counterpart. The result was a new hybridized northwestern aristocracy of Xianbei, Chinese, and Qiang descent that gave birth to the Sui and Tang dynasties. Equipment During the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420-589), a style of armour called \\"cord and plaque\\" became popular, as did shields and long swords. \\"Cord and plaque\\" armour consisted of double breast plates in the front and back held in position by two shoulder straps and waist cords, in conjunction with the usual lamellar armour. \\"Cord and plaque\\" wearing figurines are also often depicted holding an oval or rectangular shield and a long sword. Types of armour had also apparently become distinct enough for there to be separate categories for light and heavy armour. In the 6th century, Qimu Huaiwen introduced to Northern Qi the process of 'co-fusion' steelmaking, which used metals of different carbon contents to create steel. Apparently sabers made using this method were capable of penetrating 30 armour lamellae. It's not clear if the armour was of iron or leather. The Northern Wei employed the \\"iron-clad\\" Erzhu tribe who fought as armoured cavalry.

It was founded by Tuoba Gui, posthumously Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei, in 386. From 388‚Äì9, he established dominion over the Kumoxi, Jieru, and Tutulin in the east. From 390‚Äì1, he defeated the Gaoju, Yuange, Helan, Gexi, Getulin, Chinu, and Chufu north of the Yellow River. From 391‚Äì2, he defeated the Xiongnu south of the Yellow River. In the summer of 395, the heir apparent of Later Yan, Murong Bao, attacked Northern Wei. Tuoba Gui chose not to confront him head on and fled west across the Yellow River, leaving the east undefended. When Murong Bao reached the east bank of the Yellow River, a series of protracted skirmished occurred, lasting until winter. At that point Murong Bao started to retreat, but Tuoba Gui overtook him with a column of cavalry at Shenhe Slope, northwest of modern Horinger. The entire Yan army was taken by surprise and routed on 8 December 395. Murong Chui led a new invasion into Later Yan territory in 396 and defeated an army near Pingcheng, but the offensive came to an abrupt halt when he grew ill and died. The momentum reversed and Yan armies captured Bing Province in the fall, Zhongshan in 397, and Ye city in 398. Tuoba Gui died in 409 and was succeeded by his son, Tuoba Si, posthumously Emperor Mingyuan of Northern Wei. Tuoba Si was heavily involved in Chinese poetry and literature and lacked the martial drive of his predecessor. Under his reign, there were two campaigns against the Rouran to the north. Tuoba Si died in 423 and was succeeded by his son Tuoba Tao, posthumously Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei. Tuoba Tao was the polar opposite of his father. According to Sima Guang, the heir of Tuoba Si was courageous and stalwart, often leading the charge in assaulting heavily defended cities, and acted indifferently towards the sight of death. In 426 he attacked the kingdom of Xia, taking Chang'an and Tongwancheng in 427. However Chang'an was retaken the next year. In 430 Northern Wei took Luoyang from the Liu Song dynasty, conquered Northern Yan in 436, and Northern Liang in 439. Thus ended the Sixteen Kingdoms. =Tao's tyranny= After conquering Northern Liang, Tuoba Tao crushed the rebellion of Ge Wu in Guanzhong and at the suggestion of Cui Hao, instigated proscription campaigns against Buddhism. In 449, he crushed the Rouran in battle and retaliated against a Liu Song invasion with his punitive expedition, reaching as far as Guabu (southeast of Luhe, Jiangsu). He was killed in 452 by a eunuch, Zong Ai, who was killed by Lu Li and others. They installed Tuoba Jun, posthumously Emperor Wencheng of Northern Wei. =Sinicization= In 465, Tuoba Jun died and was succeeded by Tuoba Hong, posthumously Emperor Xianwen of Northern Wei. Under his reign, Northern Wei invaded the Liu Song dynasty and Qingzhou and Jizhou (ÂÜÄÂ∑û) (north Jiangsu). In 471, Tuoba Hong abdicated in favor of Yuan Hong, posthumously Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. Hong's reign saw increasing sinicization at the court. In 494, Hong secretly moved the court to Luoyang under the disguise of a campaign. In 495, he banned the Xianbei language at court. Non-Chinese languages were forbidden for all officials under the age of 30 and Xianbei surnames were replaced with Chinese names: Tuoba became Yuan. Xianbei clothing was also forbidden. Xianbei ranks were subsumed under the Chinese ones, and all Xianbei families were ranked using the new system. In 496, Xianbei nobles and generals rebelled in the north but were defeated. Even Hong's own son opposed the new policies, for which he was forced to commit suicide. In 499, Tuoba Hong died and was succeeded by Yuan Ke, posthumously Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei. Under Yuan Ke, Northern Wei invaded the Liang dynasty and conquered Yiyangin 504 and Chouchi in 506. They were however defeated at Zhongli (northeast of Fengyang, Anhui). A Liang counterattack saw the loss of Qushan (southwest of Lianyungang, Jiangsu) in 512. in 515, Yuan Ke died and was succeeded by Yuan Xu, posthumously Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei. =Collapse= In 523, drought and famine afflicted the northern frontier. Garrison commanders refused to distribute rations, causing the Six Frontier Towns to rebel under Poliuhan Baling. He was soon defeated with the aid of the Rouran khan Yujiul√º Anagui, but northern refugees entered Hubei and also rebelled under Du Luozhou and Ge Rong. In 528, Yuan Xu was poisoned by her mother and died. Erzhu Rong, a Jie general, took control of the capital and killed the empress and her son, Yuan Zhao. He enthroned Yuan Ziyou, posthumously Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei. Then with only 7,000 cavalry, Erzhu defeated Ge Rong's rebels. He enlisted the surrendered into his army, becoming the de facto ruler of Northern Wei. His victory was short lived, and Yuan Ziyou killed him in an ambush in 530. Erzhu Rong's heir, Erzhu Zhao, retaliated by sacking the capital and killing the emperor, replacing him with Yuan Ye. Erzhu Zhao failed to command his predecessor's former troops and they defected to Gao Huan. In 531, Gao Huan established an independent regime in Hebei. Being a Chinese raised in the Xianbei culture, he commanded not only the loyalty of Xianbei frontiersmen, but also that of the Han Chinese. With his supporters, Gao decisively defeated Erzhu Zhao in late spring of 532. He enthroned Yuan Xiu, posthumously Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei. In 534, Yuan Xiu fled to Chang'an under the regime of Yuwen Tai. In response, Gao Huan evicted Luoyang of its entire population and moved them to Ye city. Yuan Shanjian, posthumously Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei, was enthroned under the eastern regime. In 535, Yuan Xiu was killed by Yuwen Tai, who replaced him with Yuan Baoju, posthumously Emperor Wen of Western Wei. Thus ended the Northern Wei.

When one column was crushed by a concentration of 6,000 cavalry under Yuwen Tai, Gao retreated. Gao made a second attempt with a force of 100,000. The resulting Battle of Shayuan on 19 November saw Gao's entire force defeated in a surprise ambush by 7,000 heavy cavalry. The eastern army lost more than half its men. In 538, Western Wei attacked Luoyang but was defeated. In 542, Gao Huan tried to take the fortress of Yubi, which blocked his way into Guanzhong. After a nine day siege, he withdrew due to a snowstorm. In 543, Yuwent Tai tried to take Luoyang again and failed. In 546, Gao Huan tried to take Yubi again. He failed and died a few weeks later. In 550, Gao Yang replaced the Eastern Wei with his own dynasty, Northern Qi. Western Wei invaded the Liang dynasty in 553 and conquered the Sichuan region. They killed Emperor Yuan of Liang the next year. In 556, Yuwen Tai died. In 557, Yuwen Hu replaced Western Wei with Northern Zhou.

In 553, the Rouran submitted to Northern Qi after being defeated by the G√∂kt√ºrks. In 556, Northern Qi attacked Jiankang but was repelled. In 559, Gao Yang died and was succeeded by Gao Yin, posthumously Emperor Fei of Northern Qi. In 560, Gao Yin was deposed by Gao Yan, posthumously Emperor Xiaozhao of Northern Qi. In 561, Gao Yan died and was succeeded by Gao Zhan, posthumously Emperor Wucheng of Northern Qi. In 565, Northern Qi invaded Northern Zhou but was repelled. Gao Zhan abdicated to Gao Wei. In 573, the Chen dynasty invaded and conquered the Huai River valley. In 575, Northern Zhou mobilized 170,000 men for an attack on Luoyang. After initial success, their emperor fell ill and were forced to retreat. On 10 November 576, Northern Zhou struck at Pingyang with an army 145,000. With 60,000, the emperor took the city. As Gao Wei approached Pingyang, the enemies retreated with only 10,000 remaining in the city. On 10 January, 577, Northern Zhou returned with 80,000 men deployed in battle formation covering a wide perimeter. Gao Wei decided to engage the enemy army. When his left wing showed signs of collapsing, he fled, demoralizing his army and causing it to collapse. The Zhou army continued to advance, reaching Taiyuan on 17 January, where the defender Gao Yanzong was supported by his subordinates as a new emperor. On the 20th, 40,000 troops sallied out and were defeated. While they were retreating back into the city, the Zhou army scaled the walls. A Qi counterattack that night pushed back the invaders. On 21 January, the Zhou army breached the eastern gate and took the city, and Gao Yanzong was captured. On 22 February 577, Ye city fell the Zhou. Gao Wei was captured and killed in 578. During his flight Gao Wei abdicated to Gao Heng and later had Gao Heng abdicated to Gao Jie but the emissary he sent surrendered to Zhou, and Gao Jie, presumably unaware of the abdication, was later also defeated and captured. Gao Shaoyi fled to Tujue until 580 when he was sent back. Northern Zhou (557‚Äì581) Northern Zhou was founded by Yuwen Hu in 557. However Yuwen Hu never became emperor, instead placing Yuwen Jue on the throne, posthumously Emperor Xiaomin of Northern Zhou. Yuwen Jue tried to size power from Yuwen Hu, so Yuwen Hu had him killed and replaced with Yuwen Yu, posthumously Emperor Ming of Northern Zhou. In 560, Yuwen Hu killed Yuwen Yu and replaced him with Yuwen Yong, posthumously Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou. In 561, the Chen dynasty invaded, seizing North Hubei. In 565, an attack on Northern Qi was repelled. In 572, Yuwen Yong killed Yuwen Hu and seized complete power over the dynasty. On 10 November 576, Northern Zhou struck at Pingyang with an army 145,000. With 60,000, the emperor took the city. As Gao Wei approached Pingyang, the enemies retreated with only 10,000 remaining in the city. On 10 January, 577, Northern Zhou returned with 80,000 men deployed in battle formation covering a wide perimeter. Gao Wei decided to engage the enemy army.

On 21 January, the Zhou army breached the eastern gate and took the city. On 22 February 577, Ye city fell the Zhou. Gao Wei was captured and killed in 578. In 578, Yuwen Yong died as he was preparing to lead an expedition against the G√∂kt√ºrks. He was succeeded by Yuwen Yun, posthumously Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou. In 579, Yuwen Yun abdicated to Yuwen Chan, posthumously Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou. He was only six years old at the time and real power resided in Yang Jian. In 580, Northern Zhou seized territory north of the Changjiang. Yuchi Jiong and Wang Qian rebelled but were defeated. On 4 March 581, Yang Jian deposed Yuwen Chan, and declared himself Emperor of the Sui dynasty. Sui dynasty In 587, the Sui dynasty annexed Western Liang and invaded the Chen dynasty with 518,000 men the following year. The Sui army took Jiankang in 589, annexing Chen and ending the era of Northern and Southern dynasties. Southern dynasties Southern dynasties cavalry Southern dynasties cavalry Southern soldiers =Liu Song (420‚Äì479)= In 420, Liu Yu, posthumously Emperor Wu of Liu Song, usurped the Jin throne and replaced it with his own Liu Song dynasty. Liu Yu was originally the son of a low ranking official and his family was described as \\"poor\\". During the waning years of the Jin dynasty, Liu Yu proved himself to be an exceptionally capable commander, gifted in the use of the glaive, and worked his way up the military hierarchy. By the year 420, Liu Yu had become the dominant military power in the empire. In 422, Liu Yu died and was succeeded by his son Liu Yifu, posthumously Emperor Shao of Liu Song. In 424, Liu Yifu was deposed and succeeded by Liu Yilong, posthumously Emperor Wen of Liu Song. In 430, Northern Wei took Luoyang from Song. In 434, Song retook Hanzhong from Chouchi. In 442, Xiao Daocheng attacked the Nanman north of the Han River. In 449, Shen Qingzhi attacked the Nanman north of the Han River, taking 28,000 prisoners. In 450, Song invaded Northern Wei but was defeated. In 453, Liu Yilong was murdered by Liu Shao, who was then killed by Liu Jun, posthumously Emperor Xiaowu of Liu Song. Liu Jun spent his reign killing his brothers and checking the power of his kin. In 464, Liu Jun died, sparking a civil war. In 466, Liu Yu, posthumously Emperor Ming of Liu Song, defeated the contenders and ended the civil war. In 467, Northern Wei invaded, taking territory north and west of the Huai River. In 469, Northern Wei took Qingzhou and Jizhou (ÂÜÄÂ∑û) (north Jiangsu) In 472, Liu Yu died and was succeeded by Liu Yu, posthumously Emperor Houfei of Liu Song. The former emperor's brother rebelled but was defeated by the general Xiao Daocheng. In 477, Liu Yu was killed by Xiao Daocheng and was succeeded by Liu Zhun, posthumously Emperor Shun of Liu Song. Xiao Daocheng went to war with provincial governor Shen Youzhi, eventually winning the next year. In 479, Xiao Daocheng deposed the last emperor of Liu Song and took the title for himself, as Emperor of Southern Qi, posthumously Emperor Gao of Southern Qi. =Southern Qi (479‚Äì502)= 497 The Southern Qi dynasty founded by Xiao Daocheng in 479 lasted a mere 22 years. Xiao Daocheng died in 482 and was succeeded by Xiao Ze, posthumously Emperor Wu of Southern Qi. Xiao Ze died in 482 and was succeeded by Xiao Zhaoye. Xiao Luan assassinated him in 494 and became emperor, posthumously Emperor Ming of Southern Qi. When Xiao Luan died in 498 and Xiao Baojuan came to the throne, a series of plots and revolts by regional governors occurred. In 500, an imperial cousin named Xiao Yan raised 30,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry in revolt, claiming to enthrone Xiao Baorong as a new emperor. Northern Wei also invaded at this point and took territory south of the Huai River. In 501, Xiao Baojuan's subordinates killed him and surrendered Jiankang to Xiao Yan. In 502, Xiao Yan deposed Xiao Baorong and proclaimed himself Emperor of the Liang dynasty, posthumously Emperor Wu of Liang. Xiao Baoyin fled to Northern Wei and set a rebellion in 527 claiming himself emperor of Qi but was soon suppressed. =Liang (502‚Äì557)= 541 The Liang dynasty founded by Xiao Yan in 502 survived for 55 years, with the founder ruling for 48 of those years. To fund the state treasury, the emperor donated himself to a Buddhist monastery on three occasions and forced his ministers to pay a ransom for him each time. In 504, Northern Wei conquered Yiyang. In 507, a Northern Wei army was defeated at Zhongli (northeast of Fengyang, Anhui). In 518, Liang retook Qushan (southwest of Lianyungang, Jiangsu). In 528, Liang briefly occupied Luoyang before being expelled. In 541, L√Ω B√¥n rebelled and attacked Liang officials. In 544, L√Ω B√¥n established the Early L√Ω dynasty and became L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø (Southern Emperor). In 545, Chen Baxian drove L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø into the mountains, where he is eventually killed, but resistance continued under L√Ω Thi√™n B·∫£o. In 548, the frontier general Hou Jing rebelled, took Jiankang, and proclaimed himself emperor in 551. In 549, Hou Jing seized Taicheng. Eastern Wei took territory south of the Huai River. Xiao Yan died and was succeeded by Xiao Gang, posthumously Emperor Jianwen of Liang. In 551, Hou Jing killed Xiao Gang and declared himself emperor. In 552, Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian retook Jiankang while Hou Jing was killed. Xiao Ji declared himself emperor in Yi Province but was killed the next year. Xiao Yi became emperor, posthumously Emperor Yuan of Liang. In 553, Western Wei conquered Sichuan. In 554, Xiao Yi was captured by Western Wei and killed. In 555, Wang Sengbian set up Xiao Yuanming as emperor but Chen Baxian killed Sengbian and set up Xiao Fangzhi, posthumously Emperor Jing of Liang. In 556, Northern Qi attacked Jiankang but was repelled. In 557, Chen Baxian replaced the Liang dynasty with his own Chen dynasty, while there were two states claiming to be a continuation of Liang: Eastern Liang emperor Xiao Zhuang was defeated by Chen and fled to Northern Qi in 560, while his main subordinate Wang Lin continued to fight Chen until 573; Western Liang was cancelled by Sui in 587. ‚Äì Liang emperors ‚Äì Western Liang emperors ‚Äì Liang throne pretenders =Chen dynasty (557‚Äì589)= 562 The Chen dynasty was founded by Chen Baxian, posthumously Emperor Wu of Chen, in 557.

Built with the support of Herman Swanke's Tigerton Lumber Company, it was placed close to that lumber company's mill to protect it from fire. The building also served as a community center, housing both government offices and social functions. In 2008 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The forest that would become Shawano County had been developed for logging ever since 1843, when Charles Wescott and Samuel Farnsworth paddled up the Wolf River. In 1879, Frederick Rhinelander's Milwaukee Lakeshore & Western Railroad reached the site on the Embarrass River that would become Tigerton. The town was platted, mills opened to process the wood coming from the surrounding forest, and the community grew. With . In 1887 Herman Swanke and some partners built a sawmill two and a half miles west of Tigerton on the Embarrass River. They named their enterprise the Tigerton Lumber Company Corporation, and that mill operated until 1891, when it burned. After that disaster, they moved the sawmill to Tigerton town, and expanded it. In 1896 Swanke bought out his partners to become sole owner. His mill was producing 15,000 to 20,000 feet of lumber per day by that time. In 1897 he opened a company store in Tigerton. The village of Tigerton was incorporated in 1896. In 1904, the village board decided to construct a town hall and engine house. Charles Wojahn, a member of the site selection committee, offered to sell the town one lot. H.R. Swanke offered to sell a different lot near his mill for $675. He would also clean the lot, and he would lend the village money for the project at 5% interest. Controversy ensued, with several votes before Swanke's offer was accepted. Charles Miller designed the structure, for $25. Swanke won the bids for construction: $485 for the foundation, and $2,870 for the building if green joists were selected, or $2,920.80 if dry joists. The building is two stories, with a low-pitched hip roof topped with a broad square bell tower in one corner. The building sits on a fieldstone foundation. Above that, walls are wood frame clad in a red brick veneer. The windows are topped with decorative segmental brick arches. Inside the ground-level double door is a fire engine garage. Other rooms were used for village offices, council chambers, a polling area, and a social hall. The building also contained two steel jail cells. In 1913 the village created the Tigerton Library, and it initially located in an unheated room in the Village Hall and Engine House. By 1922, interest had waned and the library was deteriorating, so its books were merged into the library at Tigerton High School. In 1929, with renewed interest, the separate village library was revived in the Village Hall, and books were moved back from the high school. The library and village offices remained in the old Village Hall until 1969, when the safety and accessibility of the second floor became an issue. Then the library and some offices moved to an adjacent building. In 1980, the remaining functions moved to a new Village Hall. After that, the old Village Hall was used for storage for years, until the village sold it in 1994. In 2003 Tigerton Main Street bought the building, put a new roof on it, rebuilt the bell tower, and restored the arch above the truck door. The building now houses offices of Tigerton Main Street, and is rented out for social functions.

He was openly antisemite and pro-Nazi, having close relations to the German Sicherheitspolizei. Anthoni and the Minister of Interior Toivo Horelli were responsible for the deportation of 135 German refugees, including 12 Jews, Finland handed over to the Nazis in 1941‚Äì1943.  Career  = Early years = Anthoni was born to the family of the lawyer V√§in√∂ Ossian Anthoni (1868‚Äì1933). After graduating the University of Helsinki in 1927, Anthoni worked as a lensmann (Finnish: ‚Ä≥nimismies‚Ä≥) in the Kymenlaakso region. In 1933, he was appointed the police director of the Uusimaa Province. = Wartime = In February 1941, Anthoni became the director of the State Police. As Finland joined the war in June 1941, Germany started pressing the Finnish government to deport the refugees who had fled to Finland after the 1938 Anschluss. In April 1942, Anthoni visited Berlin where he discussed with Heinrich M√ºller, Friedrich Panzinger and Adolf Eichmann over the ‚Ä≥Final Solution‚Ä≥ plan concerning the Jews of Finland. Gestapo asked them to be handed over to the German authorities, which Anthoni reacted positively. He made a verbal agreement on expelling all German refugees Finland saw as ‚Ä≥unwanted element‚Ä≥. The agreement also included Russian POWs of Jewish origin. Although the Finnish government refused transferring its own Jewish citizens, Anthoni's trip caused a mass deportation of ‚Ä≥disagreeable aliens‚Ä≥ in June 1942. Among the deported were two German-born Jews. The matter was also discussed on Heinrich Himmler's visit to Finland in the late summer of 1942. The Minister of Interior Toivo Horelli and Anthony soon made a classified decision on the deportation of 27 refugees, of whom 8 were Jews. On 8 November 1942, the deported were shipped to the Estonian capital Tallinn and handed over to the Gestapo. According to the documents found in the Estonian state archives, the Jews were killed just two days later. The intention was to deport all Jewish refugees but the plan was revealed. After the intervention of the Social Democratic cabinet members V√§in√∂ Tanner and K.-A. Fagerholm the deportations were stopped. In late 1942, Anthoni asked Horelli to make a requisition for awarding the SS commander Martin Sandberger with the Order of the White Rose of Finland. Sandberger was the commander of the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst in Estonia. = After the war = As it was clear that Germany was going to lose the war, Anthoni was dismissed in March 1944. After the Moscow Armistice, he fled to Sweden but was soon returned. Anthoni was arrested in the Ostrobothnian village of Rautio in April 1945, and put into preventive detention. Anthoni never faced the Finnish war-responsibility trials. Poland and the Western Allies wanted Anthoni, Horelli and the State Police officer Ari Kauhanen to be included on the list of war criminals, but the Soviet Union never made a claim to the Finnish government. This was most likely because the Soviets focused on persons who had committed war crimes against their citizens. In early 1948, Anthoni was put in trial for misconduct. He was accused of the transfer of 76 German refugees to the Gestapo in 1942‚Äì1943. Anthoni claimed having no idea of what would happen to the Jews, and told that the deported were chosen by Horelli. In reality, Horelli had given Anthoni a complete freedom to make decisions on his own. As the Allied Commission left Finland in May 1948, Anthoni was released. The case went to the Supreme Court which dismissed the indictment in February 1949. Anthoni was only given an admonition for negligent misconduct. Anthoni worked his last years as a lawyer for the mineral company Oy Lohja Ab, owned by the prominent Finnish Nazi Petter Forsstr√∂m. He died at the Malmi Hospital in Helsinki.

She had a strong influence over her husband and was known for her knowledge of modern science and astrology. She was popular with the British and visitors would often bring her gifts relating to her astrological interests. She has also been described as a well educated woman \\"Bluestocking\\" by British. She was also known for her extraordinary kindness. Biography Setkya Devi was born on 22 December 1813 to King Tharrawaddy and his consort Kyapin Mibaya. She had seven siblings, five of whom died at young, and one of the other two, King Pagan was younger brother. She was granted the appanages of Sagaing, Myedu, Kyangyun, Tharawaddy, and Della in fief from 1837 to 1851, and later exchanged for Taunbaing in 1852. She was chosen as the Tabindaing Princess (always remained unmarried in order to become the chief queen of the next monarch) or as the Einshe Hteik Hta Mibaya (Queen of the crown prince, ·Ä°·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∫·Äõ·Äæ·Ä±·Ä∑·Äë·Ä≠·Äï·Ä∫·Äë·Ä¨·Ä∏ ·Äô·Ä≠·Äñ·ÄØ·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏) by her father. Skya Devi is as wise as she is intelligent and optimistic. She acted as an adviser of her father and even had the authority to acquit inmates of crime, which lasted until the reign of King Mindon. Because of her privilege, fifteen people were rescued including Myawaddy Mingyi U Sa, Hsinbyumashin, Yaw Mingyi U Po Hlaing and Hlaing Hteik Khaung Tin. Among them, rescuing Yaw Mingyi U Bo Hlaing was very fruitful. Death She died in 1876 and was buried in the Mandalay Palace stockade. After Sakya Devi died, King Mindon was so respected that no one allowed to enter her palace and no one was allowed to comb his hair. Extremely sad, King Mindon dressed in pure white and lived near the tomb of Sakya Devi. Her tomb was the third erected within the sacred precincts of the Palace, the first being that of Khin The (the Queen of the Northern Palace), the favourite wife of King Mindon.

In September 1983, he was charged for murdering his wife, Maureen Thompson, in their Hobart, Tasmania home and after dismembering her body, he dumped the remains down a toilet. He was not sentenced to serve in prison on the grounds of insanity, but instead, was detained in a hospital attached to the Risdon Prison Complex for an unspecified period of time. Thompson wrote an autobiography in 1993 providing stories of his early life and the subsequent murder.Wilkinson, G. (1997, September 19). Mad scientist may be freed. Herald Sun, p. 7 On 18 September 1999, several months after he attempted an escape, Thompson was found dead in his hospital cell after he hanged himself using a shoelace. His suicide, along with that of five other Risdon Prison inmates, prompted an inquest on the prison's procedures.  Personal background  Rory Jack Thompson was born in Seattle, Washington, and was the oldest of Richard Cuthbert and Alice Mary (n√©e Saunders) Thompson's three sons. Richard was a conscripted soldier before working as a fisherman, while Alice was a dental assistant. When Thompson was in the 10th grade, Richard and Alice divorced, which led to Alice's eventual alcoholism. Alice granted full custody of the children to Richard shortly after the divorce and he became their sole provider and parent. Thompson spent his childhood attending various camps and was active in a folk-dancing community in his area. It was through this community that he met his first wife Luella, who was several years his senior. He was a student at San Diego State College at the time of his marriage. After graduating with a degree in mathematics, Thompson applied to Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a post-graduate degree in oceanography. During this period Luella and Thompson divorced. Luella retained full custody of their daughter Nuala. Throughout his academic career, Thompson contributed to more than 40 scientific works, both as an individual and in collaboration. His research was wide-ranging with subjects from mathematics to oceanography. =Marriage= Thompson met his second wife, Maureen Ellen (maiden name unknown), through a mutual friend and they married soon after. When Thompson was offered a job as a temporary lecturer at the University of Western Australia, the couple decided to migrate to Australia. Thompson's second marriage resulted in two children, Melody and Rafi. In 1983, the family moved to Hobart after Thompson was promoted to the position of sponsored researcher for CSIRO in Hobart.Notorious killer in bid for freedom. (1993, October 25). Sydney Morning Herald, p. 5 Soon after the move, Maureen Thompson filed for divorce. Prior to their divorce she had reported Thompson for domestic violence and had spent several weeks in hospital due to physical abuse. As a consequence, she received a protective order to keep her from harm. During the custody battle between the Thompsons, Maureen Thompson was granted temporary custody of their children, however Thompson was granted visitation at his residence on Saturdays. Murder and investigation Thompson felt that he was under attack as Maureen had taken steps to prevent him spending money in their bank accounts. He had been accused of domestic violence, and he felt that his visitation with the children was under threat. One night while his children were at his house, Thompson set off on foot intending to kill and bury Maureen, however once in sight of her house Thompson abandoned his plan and returned home, but abandoned his initial attempt. This is not the first time Thompson had murderous thoughts, he admitted in his autobiography that he had once contemplated the murder of his first wife in order to gain custody of his eldest daughter. At this point Thompson was not sleeping well and was taking medication to help him sleep. He felt that the people around him were not on his side and that Maureen was not keeping her word in their custody battle. Thompson was also under stress from his new job, the move, the death of his mother and the threat of having to move out of the CSIRO family accommodation he was living in. Thompson bought half a sheep, dismembered it and tested to see if he could flush the pieces down the toilet. While on a work trip to Sydney he purchased a hacksaw and other tools in preparation. On 10 September 1983 Thompson took the children to his house for his scheduled visitation. Once they were in bed and locked in he set off for Maureen's house at 99 Hill Street, Hobart on foot, wearing a wig and wraparound skirt to conceal his identity and carrying a bag of tools. He waited in the garden until Maureen had gone to sleep then entered the house with a spare key. She woke, and there was a brief struggle during which he struck his estranged wife with a table leg, he then proceeded to strangle her. Following the murder Thompson cut Maureen's body into smaller pieces using a hacksaw and meat cleaver and then flushed the pieces down the toilet. He took the parts he couldn't deal with to the bush above Pottery Road, Lenah Valley and buried them. In his autobiography, Thompson explained his reasons for cutting up Maureen's body: > Why did I cut up the body? Actually, I no longer fully understand the mental > processes that led to it, but fundamentally I cut it up because it would not > flush down the toilet whole. Why flush it down the toilet? Fundamentally, to > get rid of the evidence. But why a toilet? After all, my original thought > had been simply to bury the body, but that plan had gone away, though the > folding shovel was still in the bag. I now think that in the many hours of > agonising, my adult mind collapsed between fear and the felt necessity to > make Maureen vanish, and the toilet was a very young child‚Äôs solution for > how to get rid of guilty bad doo-doo. After disposing of the body Thompson returned home to the children. The following day he took them swimming and re returned to work on Monday to finish his 50th scientific publication. On 13 September 1983, Thompson reported Maureen missing. In the early days of her disappearance, a finger was found at the sewage works sewer, which raised suspicions about Thompson's missing person report.Lalor, P. (1999, September 25). Sympathy for the devil. Daily Telegraph, p. 30 The next day, the investigators visited Maureen's house and found evidence of violence. During investigations of the house's sewer system the coroner, Dr. Royal Cummings, found 60 pieces of unidentified body parts and another 23 identified parts. Several days later, the investigators found Maureen's severed head in Lenah Valley. The ten-day-long investigation gave sufficient evidence for the police to arrest Thompson. Conviction and prison Risdon Prison Complex where Thompson spent 16 years in before his death On 29 February 1984, Thompson was not convicted of murder on the basis that he suffered from a mental disorder. As a result, Thompson was detained in Risdon Prison's hospital indefinitely. It was concluded that Thompson had a significant personality disorder, which include lack of social understanding and excess arrogance. According to his publisher, Thompson would not acknowledge his personality disorder, but occasionally ‚Äúhad little grip on reality‚Äù.Snowden, G. (1999, September 20). Publisher backs state‚Äôs treatment of scientist. Hobart Mercury, p. 3 As a result of his arrest, his two children were taken in by Maureen's sister, Kathleen Marchant, to California and they adopted the last name Marchant.Whinnett, E. (1999, July 6). Publisher backs state‚Äôs treatment of scientist.Hobart Mercury, p. 3 As they grew up, they were prohibited to contact Thompson, however, it was known that he allocated all earnings from his autobiography sales to his children's trust fund. In the years prior to his death, his son Rafi also initiated some contact with his father, with regular twice a week call. Not long before his death, Rafi pleaded for his father to be released, although his sister and aunt did not share the sentiment. In 1993, Thompson wrote an autobiography under the title Mad Scientist which was published by Southern Holdings and distributed only in Australia. Wendy Lesser, in her review on Kate Grenville's Albion‚Äôs story, mentioned his autobiography and regarded the book as ‚Äúbare and often poorly constructed‚Äù, although it gave ‚Äúan inside view of the pathetically deluded, distressingly self-justifying, willfully self-deceiving perpetrator‚Äù.Lesser, W. (1994, December 11). Prologue to rape. The New York Times, p. 7 Throughout his detention, he applied twice to the Medical Health Review Tribunal to be declared saneStein, G. For the term of his natural life. Sydney Morning Herald, p. 5 The tribunal had also suggested his release, but all attempts were declined by Tasmania's government.Whinnett, E. (1999, July 8). Ex-MLC says political decisions send wrong message. Hobart Mercury, p. 12 In 1994, Thompson legally changed his name by deed poll to Jack Newman. On 5 July 1999, Thompson attempted an escape. He was able to obtain a credit card by unknown means, which allowed him to withdraw cash to buy a commercial plane ticket to Melbourne. His permit to work in the prison garden outside the walls assisted him in his escape, however after a conversation with a woman he met at a bus- stop, Thompson, who was still clad in his prison uniform, was reported to the police. This tip enabled the authorities to capture him just minutes before his plane took off.Anderson, C. (1999, July 6). Phone call thwarts escape bid. Hobart Mercury, p. 1 Thompson's attempt to escape resulted in him being placed in a maximum-security prison. As a consequence, it is reported that Thompson suffered depression and was referred to Dr Alan Jager, one of the prison hospital's resident psychiatrists. =Death= Three days before his death, it was reported that Thompson was taken off his prescribed anti-depressant by Dr. Jager, against the advice of a locum doctor a few days prior.Anderson, C. (2000, March 3). Inquest told of day Rory Jack died. Hobart Mercury, p. 3 On 18 September 1999, Thompson was found dead in his cell after hanging himself using a shoelace. His memorial service was held on 23 September that year in an undisclosed location.Whinnett, E. (1999, September 23). Service for Rory Jack. Hobart Mercury, p. 5 His death, along with the deaths of five other inmates under Dr Jager's supervision in less than a year, prompted the Magistrates Court Tasmania to initiate an inquest into the prison hospital's psychological department.Anderson, C. (2000, March 31). Rory Jack's mercy plea before death. Hobart Mercury, p. 3 The inquest concluded that Thompson's suicide was due to the carelessness of the prison officers in both supervising a prisoner with suicidal tendency and responding to Thompson's death. It was also found that there were insufficiencies in the hospitals' practices in inmate mental health care, such as giving Thompson a cell with numerous suspension points and failure in notifying his psychiatrist about his health information.

The structure was found in 4.6% to as high as 23% of the population. Structure If present, the foramen tympanicum is located at the anteroinferior portion of the external auditory canal, locating posteromedial to the temporomandibular joint. The structure connects the external auditory canal to the infratemporal fossa. Reduction in thickness of the temporal bone may also occur in the same location. During development of the skull, the foramen tympanicum normally closes by the age of 5 years. The foramen, however, may persists in rare cases resulting in its presence in adults. The persistence of this foramen may be the result of abnormal mechanical forces during development of face and/or ossification abnormalities attributed to genetic factors.  Clinical relevance  Persistence of the foramen tympanicum may also predispose the individual to the spread of infection or tumor from the external auditory canal to the infratemporal fossa or vice versa. It is associated with herniation of soft tissues from the temporomandibular joint into the external auditory meatus, and with formation of fistula between the parotid gland and the external auditory canal. During arthroscopy of the temporomandibular joint, the endoscope may inadvertently pass into the joint via the foramen, with resulting damage.

It was broadcast in the United States by NBC on November 16, 1973, as part of the series The Midnight Special, and presented the last performance of Bowie as his character Ziggy Stardust. Lineup and content Still image from the 1980 Floor Show, segment featuring Marianne Faithfull and David Bowie The lineup included songs from the albums Aladdin Sane and Pin Ups, as well as a medley of \\"1984\\" with the then- unreleased song \\"Dodo\\". The title of the show was a play-on-words, referring to the song \\"1984\\" and \\"floor shows\\", capturing a transitional moment between the glamorous science fiction of the previous year's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars album and the dark dystopia of the Diamond Dogs album, released six months later. The live audience was made up of 200 fan club members. Visual elements The visual elements of the show referenced the Ziggy Stardust character, who, along with the Spiders from Mars, had been terminated by Bowie after a performance on July 3, 1973. The troupe of dancers wore crocheted cobweb-like costumes, and Bowie sported outfits designed by Freddi Buretti, Kansai Yamamoto and Natasha Korniloff, most notably a body-stocking outfit with a flame motif, as well as a fishnet full-leotard with stuffed gold lam√© hands. The keyhole-cutout half-leotard outfit was inspired by the Dada artist/poet Tristan Tzara's 1921 production of La Coeur a Gaz.

Designed by the architect Waddy Butler Wood, it was built between 1895 and 1897 by the Capital Traction Company as a union terminal for several Washington and Virginia streetcar lines. The adjacent Exorcist steps, later named after their appearance in William Friedkin's 1973 horror film The Exorcist, were built during the initial construction to connect M Street with Prospect Street. Intended for dual use as a passenger station and as a storage house for the streetcars, the Car Barn began Washington's only cable car system. Almost immediately after the building opened, the system was electrified and the Car Barn was converted to accommodate electric streetcars. Throughout its history as a terminal and storage facility, the Car Barn was never utilized to the extent anticipated by its construction. The building has undergone several renovations, the most extensive in 1911, when the original Romanesque Revival fa√ßade was significantly modified and the interior was almost completely gutted. Not long after its opening, the building fell into disrepair. Changing ownership over time, it maintained its original function of housing streetcars until 1950, when it was redeveloped as office space. Among its occupants was the International Police Academy, an arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, which operated out of the Car Barn in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, it is used as an academic building by Georgetown University. In 2019, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The Car Barn's original foundation supported a warehouse constructed in 1761 to store tobacco for auction unloaded from ships docked at the location of the present-day Key Bridge. The warehouse was converted to keep horses and their trolleys around 1861. On August 23, 1894, Congress authorized the extension of an existing trolley line terminating at the intersection of Bridge and High Streets (now Wisconsin Avenue and M Street respectively) to the intersection of M and 36th Streets. With the authorization, Congress required that a union station be erected at the site. Thereafter, the site was used to store horse-drawn trolley cars. = Construction = Construction on the building then known as Union Station began in early 1895 under the architectural direction of Waddy Butler Wood. The superintendent and chief engineer of the Capital Traction Company, D.S. Carll, was in charge of the construction. Before construction of the Car Barn, the two streets were joined by a steep hillside that carried 36th Street. Large amounts of earth were excavated‚Äî in total‚Äîresulting in the sharp cliff that exists today. Adjacent to the Car Barn are a set of stairs commonly known as the \\"Exorcist steps\\" and a large retaining wall, which were built at the time the Car Barn was constructed, to connect M and Prospect Streets. The steps are so named as they provided the location for the scene in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist where the priest is thrown down the stairs to his death. The building's construction was opposed by the next-door resident of the Prospect House, who furnished affidavits by prominent architects stating that blasting from the construction was damaging her house; this led to court-ordered supervision of the blasting in 1894. After the Car Barn's construction, the large edifice obstructed the view of the Potomac River and Virginia from homes on Prospect Street, including the well-known cottage of E. D. E. N. Southworth. For this reason, some considered it a \\"desecration\\" of the local scenery. The three-story, building was opened on May 27, 1897, containing offices for the several tenant trolley companies and waiting rooms that were decorated with red oak wainscot panelling, ornate iron stair railings, and stuccoed ceilings. The exterior was designed in the Romanesque Revival style. Its tower, which reached a height of , contained an elevator that shuttled passengers between the terminals. Many of the building's decorations reflect its original function. The pediment facing M Street reads \\"Capital Traction Company\\" and contains three decorative flywheels. The M Street-facing first floor served the Washington and Georgetown Railroad. The second and third floors were connected with steel trestles to allow for trolleys coming across the Potomac River from Rosslyn, which served Washington, Arlington, Falls Church, and were projected to serve the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad. The roof, which was level with Prospect Street, was used by the Metropolitan Railroad and had a covered walkway for passengers to get from the elevator to Prospect street. The station operated as Washington's only cable car trolley terminal for less than a year. Almost immediately after opening, the Car Barn was converted to operate the new electric streetcars. The Virginia lines never made use of the terminal and the Metropolitan Railroad did not use the station to the extent intended. It intended to place storage tracks on the roof of the building, but never did. = Re-design = Although regarded as well-designed before 1900, the Car Barn thereafter began a period of deterioration and neglect lasting for 50 years. The first stage of the transition from a trolley station to an office building was carried out between 1906 and 1908, when portions of the second floor were converted into office space. The electrification of streetcars necessitated a large-scale re-design of the Barn, which began in 1910. To accommodate the larger cars, the entrances to the building were extended and a new elevator was installed to lift streetcars to the roof. This transition required a near complete reconstruction of the building. The steel support beams were replaced and the entire fa√ßade was changed to extend toward M Street and increase its height to allow more office space. These modifications were complete in 1911. Further conversions of track space to office space occurred between 1921 and 1922. Extensive remodeling occurred again in 1933 with the designation of the Car Barn as the headquarters of the new Capital Transit Company, as a result of the merger between the Capital Traction Company and the Washington Railway and Electric Company, which increased the number of office workers at the building. These changes involved the removal of the roof in the center of the building, the creation of a lightwell on the third floor, the conversion of the third floor into office space, and the removal of the covered passageway on the roof. = Later uses = The last streetcar operations at the Car Barn ended with the closure of the Rosslyn‚ÄìBenning Line on April 30, 1949. The building continued to store streetcars until May 1950. Toward the end of 1952, the first floor was converted into office space. When the Capital Transit Company merged with its competitors, the building came under the ownership of its new corporate successor, the DC Transit System, in 1956. By then, the building had fallen into such a state of disrepair that the company deliberated over whether to demolish it entirely. Seeking to preserve the historic structure, it elected to redevelop it. The building underwent considerable interior renovations between 1957 and 1960, which were intended to turn the structure entirely into an office building. This involved lowering the ceilings, which were previously designed to accommodate the height of the streetcars. The building was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1967. glazing in 2017.alt=M Street view of the Car Barn in 2018 Beginning in late 1963, the Car Barn was home to the International Police Academy, operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (though officially part of the Agency for International Development) that trained Latin American police forces; members of these forces met at the Car Barn until the program was shut down in 1975. In 1992, the owner of the DC Transit System, O. Roy Chalk, was subject to foreclosure, and the building came under the ownership of the Lutheran Brotherhood. The Car Barn was purchased in 1997 by Douglas Development Corporation‚Äîwhich continues to own the building‚Äîand it was renovated the following year. The primary tenant is Georgetown University, which first began leasing space in the 1950s. After two years of renovation by the university that ended in 2017, the first floor garage was converted to house the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Georgetown University Press. The building today has four floors and has a floor area of .

History  The SockelFlak started life as defensive armament for Zeppelin airships against fighter attack. However, once defenders discovered that airships filled with hydrogen were vulnerable to machine guns firing tracer ammunition Zeppelin losses mounted and the Germans switched to less vulnerable bomber aircraft. This meant that the SockelFlak needed to find a new role. As the threat posed by ground attack aircraft increased the need for specialized anti-aircraft guns also increased. At first, all of the combatants employed heavy machine guns and light field guns on improvised anti-aircraft mounts to combat reconnaissance and ground attack aircraft. Heavy machine guns were often placed on improvised pedestal mounts while light field guns were typically propped up on earthen embankments or scaffolds to point the muzzle pointed skyward. A heavy machine gun was capable of shooting down an attacking aircraft but the amount of time on target was brief and the probability of scoring a killing blow with rifle caliber rounds wasn't that great. While a medium caliber anti-aircraft gun was capable of destroying an attacking aircraft with one shot but its slow rate of fire combined with its slow elevation and traverse limited its usefulness against small fast moving targets at short range. Instead, the niche for medium caliber anti-aircraft guns was as a barrage weapon firing timed explosives at distant targets. What was needed was a fast firing, mobile, and easy to wield weapon which could fire a small explosive round to destroy an attacking aircraft with a few well- placed shots. It was under these conditions that the SockelFlak was redesigned to fulfill the light anti-aircraft role.  Design  The SockelFlak was a gas-operated semi-automatic cannon which fired a steel base fused explosive round with two brass driving bands. The gun was mounted on a light three- legged pedestal mount with a seat for the gunner and could be broken down into four loads for short-range transport or carried in one piece on a cart by a two-horse team for longer trips. There were two spade grips for aiming and the gun was fired by a trigger operated by the gunner's knee while seated. Since the gun wasn't originally meant for field use it was prone to stoppages due to dust and dirt. It had a cyclic rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute but its top loaded 10 round clip was slow to change which meant that although easy to wield it had a limited time on target and slow practical rate of fire. The first 20 guns were delivered in December 1917 and by the time of the armistice, there were 150 in service.

He has served as a judge of the Cohoes, New York City Court since 2016. Marcelle has been nominated three times to be a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The first two nominations expired, and the third was withdrawn by President Donald Trump at Marcelle's request due to opposition from U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.  Education  Marcelle received his Bachelor of Arts from Bowdoin College and his Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, from Cornell Law School, where he served on the Cornell Law Review.  Legal career  In 1990, Marcelle served as a trial attorney at the United States Department of Justice. In that role, he worked on cases involving the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. He has also served as a public defender, working under Doug Rutnik, who is the father of U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Marcelle ran for Albany County District Attorney as a Republican in 1993. His bid to unseat incumbent Sol Greenberg was unsuccessful. Marcelle was legal counsel to the Republican minority in the Albany County Legislature from 2002 to 2011. He has also served as Senior Ccounsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, known at the time as the Alliance Defense Fund. In 2012, Democratic Albany County Executive Dan McCoy nominated Marcelle to the position of Albany County Attorney. The nomination met with \\"vocal condemnation from quarters of the county's LGBT, labor and progressive Democratic communities\\". Opponents of the nomination launched a website calling for legislators to vote against Marcelle, decrying his work with Alliance Defending Freedom. On February 13, 2012, the Albany County Legislature voted, 27‚Äì10, to confirm Marcelle's nomination. In 2016, Marcelle took a position as Counsel to the Albany County Sheriff. Later that year, he left that position for a newly created job as a youth diversion activities coordinator. Marcelle made this move after having asked the state's Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics whether his work with the Sheriff's Office created a conflict of interest with his part-time judgeship on the Cohoes City Court. The Committee found that holding both jobs would create an \\"appearance of impropriety\\". As of 2018, Marcelle was a member of the New York Conservative Party. He is a former Republican. He has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1990. = Appearance before the U.S. Supreme Court = In 2001, Marcelle argued and won a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. In that case, Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98 (2001), Marcelle represented a Good News Club in Otsego, New York. The Good News Club sought to allow elementary school students the right to meet after school in a public school building for Bible study and prayer. The Court ruled, 6‚Äì3, in favor of the Good News Club.  Judicial career  = Failed federal district court nomination by George W. Bush = On July 31, 2008, President George W. Bush nominated Marcelle to be a United States District Judge for the Northern District of New York. The nomination wasn't acted upon due to opposition from U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York, who withheld a blue slip consenting to the nomination.https://www.chron.com/local/article/Marcelle-seen-in-line-for- federal-judgeship-12889507.php The nomination expired at the end of Bush's term. = State court service = In 2016, Marcelle was nominated as a judge of the Cohoes City Court by then-Mayor Shawn Morse.

It is one of the springs of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB). It was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 4 August 2009.  History  Aboriginal Australians have used the artesian springs of the GAB for an extended period of time. Some of these GAB artesian springs feature in Aboriginal myths and hold significant spiritual and cultural values for indigenous communities. Artesian springs were, and still are, a valuable resource for the support of wildlife, and were a vital source of fresh water in an arid environment.Information sourced from QDNRW 2007 The need for fresh water was also obvious to the first European settlers who ventured west of the Great Dividing Range. These early settlers, encouraged by good seasons, brought their sheep and cattle out onto the great rolling plains. They soon learned that inland Australia was a harsh environment where droughts were common. The inland of Australia is traversed by streams but these rarely flow and have few permanent waterholes. Unpredictable rainfall and high evaporation meant that early dams and earth tanks built to service the growing population and pastoral industry were unreliable. Permanent water supplies were needed to allow livestock to survive on the arid plains and to provide supplies for the growing service towns. Europeans first discovered the artesian groundwater of the GAB in 1878 when a shallow bore sunk near Bourke in New South Wales produced flowing water. Many bores were soon drilled near the margins of the GAB in New South Wales and South Australia. In 1885 the Queensland Government Geologist decided to drill a deep bore at Blackall to try to prove the existence of deep artesian supplies in Queensland and provide reliable water supplies during the drought. However, before the completion of this bore, the first artesian flow in Queensland was obtained near Cunnamulla in 1887. The number of bores drilled in Queensland increased from 34 to 524 in the ten-year period from 1889 to 1899. By 1915 over 1,500 flowing artesian bores had been drilled throughout the Basin. The assurance of a reliable water supply for settlers and their stock meant the development of a valuable sheep and cattle industry. Thousands of kilometres of bore drains were excavated to distribute water around properties, thus allowing sheep and cattle to be raised on the vast Mitchell grass, mulga and spinifex plains. Bore drains are small, open channels that can extend 100 kilometres or more. The water from the GAB continues to be of vital importance to outback regions of Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. This water is often the only available supply for towns and properties for their domestic and stockwatering requirements. The GAB also supplies water for minor irrigation works, key mining and extractive industries, the petroleum industry, an emerging tourism industry and limited industrial purposes. Sound management of this important natural resource by the present users will ensure that future generations may also benefit from this reliable water source.  Description  Elizabeth Springs is at about 101ha, comprising Lot 1 on SP120220. The Great Artesian Basin is one of the largest artesian systems in the world and occupies about 22% of the Australian continent. Artesian springs lie around the rim of the GAB, occurring in complexes of springs known as a \\"supergroup\\", and are the natural outlets of the artesian aquifers from which groundwater of the GAB flows to the surface. The artesian springs, also known as mound springs, are loosely divided into recharge springs and discharge springs. Recharge springs are primarily found along the GAB's eastern rim on the Great Dividing Range where the GAB aquifers outcrop in an area of relatively high rainfall allowing recharge. The recharge springs release excess GAB recharge water or, in topographic lows intercept the GAB recharge aquifers. The western margin of the GAB also has an area where the GAB aquifers outcrop but recharge is minimal as rainfall is low and intermittent. Discharge springs are those that release groundwater that has entered the GAB from the recharge zones, which flows towards the GAB's southern, southwestern, western and northern margins. Groundwater dating research has found that water in furthest areas from the recharge areas has been moving through the GAB's porous rock strata (aquifers) for up to a million years. Elizabeth Springs are regarded as a discharge spring complex and consists of at least five active artesian mound springs together with a few semi-active mounds immediately adjacent. There are eleven supergroups in the main part of the GAB extending from Bourke in New South Wales and Lake Eyre in South Australia, and two outlier spring supergroups on Cape York Peninsula, including one on the Peninsula's northern tip. The GAB springs and spring complexes number around six hundred, but one \\"spring\\" may represent between two and four hundred spring outlets and supergroups may be regional clusters of such springs, often covering relatively small areas. GAB springs range in size from small springs only a few metres across such as Bundoona Springs, in southern Queensland, to major complexes of up to sixty springs with quite large pools such as Dalhousie Springs, in northern South Australia. Some GAB artesian springs have associated discharge mounds that consist of mud, but most of the springs deposit calcium carbonate, especially the discharge springs, or other salts from the mineral-rich waters discharging from the springs. These evaporites typically form characteristic salt deposits around the spring outflow that can extend for several hundred metres as a distinctive white tail, sometimes yellow or even black, often with a central carbonate mound grading into sulphate and chloride salts. In many instances, particularly among South Australian GAB springs, these deposits combine with wind-blown sand, mud and accumulated plant debris to form mounds around the spring outflow, with the resulting formation resembling a small volcano, colloquially called a \\"mound spring\\". Many of the Queensland GAB springs are \\"softer\\" and fail to develop anything more substantial than a mound of a few centimetres to a few metres in height,Fensham et al 2004 hence the use of the more readily interpreted term of \\"artesian spring\\" rather than \\"mound spring\\". Mound formation of GAB springs is controlled by a range of factors, including groundwater discharge and evaporation rates, hydrochemistry, influence of organic versus organic carbonate precipitation and local subsidence of the mound. Dating of GAB springs using thermoluminescence, uranium-thorium and carbon-14 dating of quartzose sands and carbonate springs deposits have produced dates of more than 740,000¬± years. Research has found large spring complex deposits reflect geological and hydrological changes in eastern and central Australia during the last Quaternary (last 2.6 million years) and provide an understanding of long-term changes prior to human intervention.Habermahl 2006 Groundwater dating, using carbon-14 and chlorine-36 studies, has found water aged several thousand years near recharge areas and more than a million years near the centre of the GAB. The groundwater moves slowly, at less than one metre per year to approximately five metres per year, generally in a south, southwest, west direction and also northwards in the northern portion of the GAB. Elizabeth Springs form part of the Springvale River supergroup, one of the two most westerly supergroups in Queensland, and lie approximately 300 kilometres south-southeast of Mount Isa. The Springvale supergroup is a group of springs that, with the exception of Elizabeth Springs, are largely extinct or heavily modified. The main group of springs comprising Elizabeth Springs extends over an area of approximately 400 by 500 metres and consists of a series of low mounds and travertine-encrusted outflows. The mounds and surrounding outflows and seepages are well vegetated with sedges and a range of other species including large areas of the spring endemic Eriocaulon carsonii subsp. carsonii, the salt pipewort, which is a perennial and a nationally EPBC-listed threatened species. GAB artesian springs are a significant refuge in arid and semi-arid Australia, providing one of the few sources of natural permanent water. Estimates of the age of artesian springs have concluded that individual springs may last for up to a few hundred thousand years, but spring groups collectively may last possibly up to several million years. The presence of such permanent freshwater in inland Australia over the past few million years has provided habitat for a wide array of fish, invertebrates and plants that have been \\"stranded\\" in GAB artesian springs as inland Australia has dried out. Ecologically GAB artesian springs are considered an evolutionary refuge as they allow wetland dependent (specialised habitat) species to persist as their original geographic range becomes uninhabitable due to drying over an extended period of time because of climatic change. With the contraction of their main range, relictual species are hypothesised to have evolved different characteristics from their original stock, leading to the high levels of endemism (the frequency of species with restricted distributions) in isolated GAB artesian spring groups.Brown and Gibson 1983 Hence artesian springs provide the localised habitat requirements for a suite of endemic (restricted to one or more GAB spring) fish and aquatic invertebrate species which include hydrobiid molluscs, isopods, ostracods, amphipods, copepods and flatworms.Morton et al, 1995, p.11, p.119 & p.134 GAB artesian springs hold plants and animals that have evolved into new species found nowhere else. The presence of endemic species, and large peat mounds, indicates that some GAB springs have been active for a very long time. Hydrobiid snails are the best studied of these endemic groups. Hydrobiid snails are the most diverse of all freshwater gastropods and frequently have small distribution ranges, resulting in high levels of endemism.Perez et al 2005 This makes them excellent candidates for evolutionary studies on endemism and speciation and for use as potential indicators (surrogates) of the importance of environments such as GAB artesian springs for other, less well- studied freshwater taxa.Ponder pers. comm. 2004 Hydrobiid snails are particularly well represented in GAB artesian springs with well over 23 taxa and five genera, although each mound complex or aggregation is separated by hundreds of kilometres. It has been hypothesised that this is a result of ancestral Gondwanan hydrobiids being stranded by the increasing aridity of inland Australia and being isolated in the permanent waters of GAB artesian springs.De Deckker 1986Ponder 1986 Recent work has demonstrated that the GAB hydrobiid snails have evolved in three separate radiations, one in Queensland and two in South Australia, with the Queensland hydrobiids and those of South Australia being completely unrelated. The Elizabeth Springs, on its own and collectively with the other significant discharge springs comprising the GAB springs, are notable examples of the endemism exhibited by GAB artesian springs. Elizabeth Springs has one endemic snail and one endemic fish.Ponder 2004 It also has four endemic GAB artesian spring plant species as well as five relict spring plant species, plants that have survived from when inland Australia was wetter. A number of other possible endemic invertebrates also exist at the springs. In addition at least one species of frog, four species of reptile, 50 species of birds, four species of mammals, and 13 species of plants are known from the vicinity of the springs from a species list generated by the Australian Natural Heritage Assessment Tool,ANHAT 2005 & 2008 and as detailed in a Queensland Herbarium report based on comprehensive ground surveys. = Condition = Surveys over the last twenty years have shown that most of the remaining active GAB artesian springs in Queensland are suffering damage from draw-down or stock. Trampling by stock or modification of the spring to improve access for stock is a serious threat to GAB springs. Trampling (also known as pugging) modifies the physical structure of the microhabitat, which are small scale habitat zones with different environment conditions, and if serious enough, removes the microhabitat entirely. Modification of the spring, normally by digging the spring out to improve the pooling of water, removes the microhabitat altogether. In 2004 there was evidence of cattle grazing within the Elizabeth Springs reserve, with some trampling of the seepages and outflows surrounding the mounds. However, since fencing after 2004 the overall condition of the Elizabeth Springs has vastly improved reducing the previous impacts on the intact relictual biota. The endemic species associated with GAB artesian springs, particularly the vascular plants and invertebrates, appear to be highly sensitive to changes in water flow or conditions at the springs. This is at least in part due to the dependence of many species on microhabitats such as seepages of only a few millimetres depth. A range of human activities that have been occurring over the last 120 years impacts GAB artesian springs. The most serious is groundwater extraction resulting in draw-down of water pressure at the spring, primarily but not exclusively due to numerous uncapped artesian bores and inefficient earth drains, and the loss or modification of microhabitat and ultimately the extinction of the spring. Groundwater extraction has been implicated in the extinction of many springs and has been partly addressed by the extensive GAB bore-capping programme. Extraction for other uses such as mining and town water supply remains a substantial impact. Reductions in flow at Elizabeth Springs have been observed, although in some other springs flow appears to have stabilised. Draw-down remains the most serious threat to GAB artesian springs. Lastly, the spread of the introduced mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) is a threat to the freshwater endemics of all the GAB artesian springs. Gambusia has not been reported from Elizabeth Springs. The GAB Sustainability Initiative (GABSI) is a jointly funded initiative of the Federal and State governments and pastoral bore owners. GABSI aims to preserve the pressure of the Great Artesian Basin, and reduce water waste, through rehabilitating uncontrolled bores and replacing bore drains with polyethylene pipes, tanks and troughs for livestock water. Although a substantial number of bores are now being fully controlled with water distributed by pipelines to tanks and troughs, about 80% of the total outflow from the Basin is still wasted because of inefficient water delivery systems. This condition report drew on a number of source.Morton et al 1995, p.119Ponder pers. comm. 1/3/2005Fairfax and Fensham 2002Fensham and Fairfax 2003  Heritage listing  Elizabeth Springs is one of a suite of nationally important artesian springs in the Great Artesian Basin, which is the world's largest artesian basin. The artesian springs have been the primary natural source of permanent water in most of the Australian arid zone over the last 1.8 Million years (the Pleistocene and Holocene periods). These artesian springs, also known as mound springs, provide vital habitat for more widespread terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates with aquatic larval young, and are a unique feature of the arid Australian landscape. As these artesian springs are some distance from each other in the Australian inland, and individually each one covers a relatively tiny area, their isolation has allowed the freshwater animal lineages to evolve into distinct species, which include fish, aquatic invertebrates (crustacean and freshwater snail species) and wetland plants. This results in a high level of endemism, or species that are found nowhere else in the world. Elizabeth Springs is nationally significant as it holds a suite of species which are genetically and evolutionarily distinct from other Great Artesian Basin springs, including an endemic freshwater snail and an endemic fish species. Elizabeth Springs also holds four of the eleven known Great Artesian Basin spring wetland endemic plants, along with five plant species not recorded within 500 kilometres of the springs, which are indicative of a wetter past. Elizabeth Springs is the only remaining relatively intact Great Artesian Basin spring with extant biota (fauna and flora) in far western Queensland and is regarded as one of the most important artesian springs because of its isolation, intactness and the extinction of other springs. Over 74% of the artesian springs in Queensland are extinct (no longer flowing) and all the artesian springs in New South Wales are extinct or badly damaged. Elizabeth Springs was listed on the Australian National Heritage List on 4 August 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Events, Processes Elizabeth Springs is one of a suite of important artesian discharge springs in the Great Artesian Basin for endemic fish, invertebrates (including hydrobiid gastropod molluscs) and plants, and has also been ranked by CSIRO as a nationally \\"significant\\" semi-arid and arid refugia in Australia for regional endemics of aquatic invertebrates (isopods, ostracods, and hydrobiid molluscs) and fish. GAB artesian springs are important for illustrating the role of evolutionary refugia for relict species,Morton et al, 1995, p.11 which have evolved into distinct and endemic species in the GAB springs. Elizabeth Springs contains one artesian spring endemic hydrobiid snail, Jardinella isolata;ANHAT 2005 & 2008Ponder and Clark 1990, p.301Ponder et al 1995. p 554 an endemic fish species the Elizabeth Springs goby Chlamydogobius micropterus (,DEW DEW2007a and four of the 11 known GAB spring wetland endemic plants. Elizabeth Springs contains the threatened saltmarsh pipewort (Eriocaulon carsonii subsp. carsonii), a relict species of tropical Australia that is largely endemic to the artesian springs of the GAB.R.J.-P. Davies et al 2007 They also contain three of the other GAB spring endemics: Eragrostis fenshamii, Fimbristylis sp.RJ Fensham 3743 and Myriophyllum artesium.Rod Fensham, pers. comm., 28/10/2008 Elizabeth Springs also contains five other relict plant species, which are not recorded within 500 km of the springs: Isotoma fluviatilis, Pennisetum alopecuroides, Plantago gaudichaudii, Schoenus falcatus and Utricularia caerulea. Criterion B: Rarity Extant artesian springs in the GAB are a geographically rare phenomenon, each one covering a tiny area within the basin. Over 74% of the GAB springs in Queensland are extinct (no longer flowing) and all the GAB artesian springs in New South Wales are extinct or badly damaged.Ponder 1989, p.416Wilson 1995, p.12 Elizabeth Springs is regarded as one of the most important GAB artesian springs because of its isolation, relative intactness and the extinction of other springs in far Western Queensland.Ponder 2006Zeidler pers. comm. 2005 Criterion D: Principal characteristics of a class of places The GAB is the world's largest example of an artesian basin and associated artesian springs.Harris 1992 p 157 GAB artesian springs are the primary sources of permanent fresh water within the arid zone since at least the late Pleistocene (the last 1.8 million years) and are therefore a unique feature of the arid Australian landscape.Ponder 1986, p.416Morton et al 1995, p.55Bowler 1982, pp.35-45 As the primary natural source of permanent fresh water in most of the arid zone, GAB artesian springs represent vital habitat for more widespread terrestrial vertebrates, and invertebrates with aquatic larvae.Ponder 1986, p.415 Elizabeth Springs is one of a suite of important artesian discharge GAB Springs that are outstanding examples of the endemism exhibited by artesian springs individually and collectively.Ponder 2003 Species found at Elizabeth Springs include an endemic freshwater hydrobiid snail Jardinella isolata, and an endemic fish species, the Elizabeth Springs goby Chlamydogobius micropterus.Ponder and Clark 1990 p 301Ponder et al 1995, p.554DEW DE2007a Elizabeth Springs is the only remaining relatively intact GAB spring with extant biota (fauna and flora) in far Western Queensland and holds a suite of species which are genetically and evolutionarily distinct from other GAB springs.Wilson 1995, p.2 & p.7Zeidler pers. comm.

It was designed by James Barnet and built in 1881. It is also known as Campbelltown Post Office (former). The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Permanent European settlement in the Campbelltown area had begun in 1809 as an alternative to the flood- prone Hawkesbury district. Work on a road from Sydney to Liverpool was started in 1811. It was opened in August 1814 and was soon extended further south to Appin. This road, variously known as Campbelltown Road, Appin Road or the Sydney Road, passed through Campbelltown. The section through the town was called the High Street until the last decade of the 19th century when it was renamed Queen Street.Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1995, vol.2, 1-2 The land on which the Queen Street cottages stand was part of a grant of to Joseph Phelps in 1816. He had been working the land for some years before receiving formal title to it. Phelps was one of the farmers of Airds and Appin who subscribed funds for a Sydney courthouse in July 1813. His grant was seized, possibly as soon as it was formally issued, by the Provost Marshal, William Gore in lieu of payment by Phelps of debts totalling ¬£170. The land was auctioned in January 1817 to William Bradbury for ¬£100 plus twelve cattle and the grain produced from the crop growing on the land. Immediately north of Phelps' grant, Assistant Surveyor James Meehan had informally reserved for a village.AMCG, 1994 say \\"in 1815\\". In 1816 most of the land in the area was granted, leaving a portion of 175 acres unalienated, and surrounded by several grants.AMCG, 1994, 9. The reserved land was formally declared a town by Governor Macquarie in December 1820 and named Campbelltown in honour of his wife (Elizabeth)'s family. William Bradbury (1774-1836) a native of Birmingham, was transported to NSW aboard the Guildford in 1812. His wife Elizabeth remained in England but his daughter, Mary (1797-1852) followed her father to Australia in 1815. Bradbury had no other children in NSW, though he established a relationship with a woman named Alice and in April 1836 married a Campbelltown widow, Catherine Patrick, n√©e Acres (-1883). Bradbury died two months later. Governor Macquarie visited Campbelltown in January 1822. He and his party ate a \\"hearty\\" breakfast at 'Bradbury's', indicating that Bradbury had built an inn. This was probably the inn later known as the Royal Oak, on the western side of the High Street. Macquarie noted in his journal that 'Bradbury is building a very good two storey brick house on his own farm and on a very pretty eminence immediately adjoining Campbell-Town as an inn for the accommodation of the public, and having asked me to give his farm a name, I have called it Bradbury Park. In 1826 Bradbury Park House was considered by William Dumaresq, inspector of roads and bridges, as the best building in Campbelltown when he reported on buildings suitable for military use. As the main street of Campbelltown, High Street or Sydney Road and later Queen Street, was at the edge of town, one side of the street was not within the town boundary while the other was. Canny traders soon realised that either side of the main road was as good as the other and leased or bought land from the grantees bordering the town proper. By the 1840s more than a few shops and hotels occupied the western side of the High Street. The coming of the railway in 1858 also aided in securing the commercial focus of the town on Queen Street. The Queen Street terraces were identified by Helen Baker (Proudfoot) in the early 1960s as a unique group of two-storey late Georgian vernacular buildings which were considered to form the only surviving late-1840s streetscape within the County of Cumberland. The buildings were acquired by the Cumberland County Council and its successors, the State Planning Authority and Department of Planning, to ensure their preservation. =Campbelltown Post Office (former)= The Commercial Banking Company (CBC) of Sydney opened its first (leased) Campbelltown office in 1874, across the other side of Queen Street.Branch Manager's report, 100/85, 26/3/1985 AMCG (1994, 14) states that CBC bought 263 Queen Street from Samuel Parker (not Morris) in 1876 and had the present bank building built in 1881. The bank moved into its new premises in 1881. The bank sold a portion of the land it bought from Parker in 1880. The land was purchased in the name of the Queen for a new post office. That building was completed the same year as the CBC chambers.AMCG, 1994, 14 Campbellttown was one of the seven first country postal depots in New South Wales., with postmaster John Scarr appointed in 1828. Constructed in 1881 and designed by James Barnet. A small central pedimented panel containing a clock, designed by local architect A. R. Payten was inserted in 1883. In 1959 the bank sold off another portion of its 1876 purchase to the Commonwealth of Australia, presumably for the creation of a telephone exchange. Following the sale of the Post Office and as a requirement of the sale, the Commonwealth Government sought the placement of a Permanent Conservation Order over the building. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the building on 22 July 1983. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  The former Post office is a two storied rendered brick classical revival building, with three semi-circular arches in the front bay facade under the front verandah. Victorian Italianate style balcony and clock added 1893 by A. R. Payten the small two storey building has a three-arch arcade at ground level and verandah above, with a small central pedimented panel containing a clock, reputedly designed by local architect A.

Education and career Bradburn was born on 17 March 1918 in Normanby in North Yorkshire, the daughter of a marine engineer and a Scotswoman. She attended a school that didn't approve of girls studying mathematics, but allowed her to progress through the mathematics curriculum at her own rate, several years ahead of the other students. She earned a state scholarship, but at 17, she was below the required age for Oxford and Cambridge, so she ended up going to Royal Holloway College. She was a student there beginning in 1935 and, despite multiple extracurricular activities, earned first class honours in mathematics in 1938, and completed a master's degree there in 1940. With another scholarship from the University of London, she went to the University of Edinburgh for graduate study with Max Born, beginning in 1941; her dissertation was The Statistical Thermodynamics of Crystal Lattices. She taught briefly at Edinburgh and the University of Dundee before returning to Royal Holloway as an instructor in 1945. She remained at Royal Holloway through its 1965 transition from a women's college to a coeducational one (a change that she supported), until her retirement in 1980. Recognition and legacy She became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1955. The mathematics department of Royal Holloway offers an annual prize to undergraduates, the Mary Bradburn Prize, named in her memory. The British Federation of Women Graduates also offers a Mary Bradburn Prize, from a bequest left by Bradburn.

His long and turbulent rule was characterised by internecine family and tribal disputes and he was finally removed as Ruler in a 1948 coup.  Accession  Sultan bin Salim took over as wali or governor of Ras Al Khaimah when his brother Muhammad handed over control in July 1919. Sultan's father, Sheikh Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi had managed affairs in Ras Al Khaimah since 1910 and had consolidated power to the point where the emirate was in all but name independent of Sharjah. Salim died in August 1919 and Sultan bin Salim petitioned the British for Ras Al Khaimah to be recognised as a Trucial State and himself as its Ruler. In December 1919, the Political Resident, Arthur Prescott Trevor, visited Ras Al Khaimah and concluded that Sultan was too young to maintain his precarious grip on power in light of the strong factions supporting his brother Muhammad and decided to withhold recognition. Revisiting the question the following year, Trevor found Sultan had consolidated control and recommended the Government of India recognise him as Ruler, which it did on 7 June 1921, making Ras Al Khaimah the sixth Trucial State and establishing its independence both from Sharjah and its Ruler, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi.  Rule  Sultan bin Salim was only too aware of his family's turbulent past and moved to not only consolidate power but centralise it along with the revenues accruing to the Ruler. In 1906, J. G. Lorimer had estimated the revenues of the town at some 6,300 Rupees from pearling and 800 Rupees from customs duties. Ras Al Khaimah and its dependencies (Jazirat Al Hamra, Khatt, Rams and Dhayah, and Sha'am) also benefited from unusually rich agriculture and Ras Al Khaimah town alone had 15,600 date trees. This modest income had many claimants among members of the ruling family and Sultan was quick to deny them: in 1927 he had one of his cousins exiled after a bitter dispute over Sultan's refusal to pay allowances to family members. In 1928, Sultan bin Salim found himself dragged into the dispute between the former Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al Qasimi (from whom he had gained independence) and the current Ruler, Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi, when the Sheikhs of the Na'im and Bani Ka'ab asked him to intercede and take over the inland oasis town of Dhaid on Khalid's behalf. The town had been formally ceded to Khalid by Sultan of Sharjah, but armed men loyal to Sultan remained there and Sultan bin Salim faced being brought into an expensive operation which would have yielded no revenue and precious little gain in influence. Furthermore, it threatened to bring him into conflict with the Ruler of Sharjah. He avoided being embroiled when Khalid entered Dhaid and took control in July 1928. = Claim over Kalba = Sultan was also reluctant to be pushed into schemes which furthered British interests in the area, particularly in the provision of infrastructure and increased British interference in issues which a number of the Trucial Sheikhs saw as their internal affairs. His relationship with the British wasn't improved in 1937, when his sister's husband, the Ruler of Kalba, died suddenly. Sultan bin Salim asserted his sovereignty over Kalba and moved quickly with a force of armed men against the emirate. The British had a vested interest in Kalba, which was the site of the backup landing strip to Sharjah airport and Sultan was punished by being sent to Bahrain. Following protracted negotiations, Kalba was held as a Regency by Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi. = Oil concession and coup = Sultan's finances were worsened by the decline of pearling and the global impact of the Great Depression of 1929. Strangely, this impecunity helped him maintain his hold on power but when he secretly signed a lucrative oil concession with Petroleum Development Ltd, outraged family members conspired to have him removed and, in 1948, Saqr bin Mohammad Al Qasimi mounted a successful bloodless coup against his uncle. Sultan bin Salim Al Qasimi died in 1951.

The film centers around the life of poet and painter Kamachi Yamada at the age of 17. The film stars Lead member Shinya Tanuichi as the titular character. The film was originally distributed at the 109 Cinemas Takasaki in Takasaki, Gunma, Kamachi Yamada's place of birth, on February 28, 2004. It was released nationwide two weeks later on March 13, 2004. Plot The film opens in 1975 with the character Kamachi Yamada (Shinya Tanuichi), who strives to be the best he can be. His motto throughout his life was \\"24 hours a day is not enough.\\" However, when he fails to get into an elite school, he enlists in a cram school, where he meets Yoko (Fumiko Himeno), who he falls in love with. After confessing his love, she suggests they remain friends, much to his dismay. Twenty years later, Shun (Hiroki Nakadoi) starts a web site, calling for people to \\"enter another world.\\" A girl, Miyuki (Akane Osawa), and a boy, Yuichi (Keita Furuya), respond. All three attend the same cram school, of which an older Yoko (Fumi Dan) is now an instructor, and Miyuki purchases sleeping pills from Shun. Throughout the film, Yoko helps the troubled teens in breaking away from the use of drugs and learning to live in the moment. At the end, she tells Miyuki about Kamachi, who was trying to live his life to the fullest, and how much he loved her. In 1977, two years after Kamachi and Yoko met, Kamachi had received the news that his studying paid off and he was accepted into an elite high school. It was also the day when Yoko had told Kamachi that it was possible they would not remain friends forever. In 1977, at the age of seventeen, Kamachi lost his life due to being electrocuted from malfunctioning musical equipment. His death was caused by the very guitar he was given for his birthday a few months prior.

He had begun to draw pictures when he was a year-and-a-half. By the time he was in grade 2, he had begun to write down his own poetry by the advice of his mother. By grade 3, he was able to draw several pictures of animals from memory within an hour. By grade 9, Kamachi began to immerse himself in rock music due to the likes of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith, among others. During that year, he formed a rock group with his friends. He had rebelled against the Japanese education system, causing him to fail his entrance exam for senior high school. During his time in which he began studying to retake the exam, he had lost a childhood friend, who he was in love with. The stress led him back to painting and poetry. Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, Kamachi was electrocuted by the guitar in his Tatami room in 1977. It was after his passing when his family discovered multiple notebooks full of poetry, watercolor paintings and drawings. The works were later placed in a museum. Soundtrack Kamachi featured music composed and performed by Koji Endo, along with performances with Bonnie Pink and Anamu & Maki. While the hip-hop group Lead performed the film's theme song, \\"Get Wild Life\\", it was not featured on the soundtrack. The group had released the song on December 3, 2003, three months before the film's release.

The property is owned by Campbelltown City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Airds= was an early name used to describe the entire Campbelltown area. Governor Macquarie, on his first visit in 1810, wrote: 'I intend forming this tract of country into a new and separate district for the accommodation of small settlers, and to name it Airds in honour of my dear good Elizabeth's family estate (in Scotland)'. Airds was widely used at first but as individual local villages came into being, the broad name fell out of use and it wasn't reborn until 1975 when the NSW Housing Commission converted bush farms at \\"South Kentlyn\\" into a new housing estate - Airds.Macarthur Advertiser Permanent European settlement in the Campbelltown area had begun in 1809 as an alternative to the flood-prone Hawkesbury district. Work on a road from Sydney to Liverpool was started in 1811. It was opened in August 1814 and was soon extended further south to Appin. This road, variously known as Campbelltown Road, Appin Road or the Sydney Road, passed through Campbelltown. The section through the town was called the High Street until the last decade of the 19th century when it was renamed Queen Street.Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1995, vol.2, 1-2 The land on which the Queen Street cottages stand was part of a grant of to Joseph Phelps in 1816. He had been working the land for some years before receiving formal title to it. Phelps was one of the farmers of Airds and Appin who subscribed funds for a Sydney courthouse in July 1813. His grant was seized, possibly as soon as it was formally issued, by the Provost Marshal, William Gore in lieu of payment by Phelps of debts totalling ¬£170. The land was auctioned in January 1817 to William Bradbury for ¬£100 plus twelve cattle and the grain produced from the crop growing on the land. Immediately north of Phelps' grant, Assistant Surveyor James Meehan had informally reserved for a village.AMCG, 1994 say \\"in 1815\\". In 1816 most of the land in the area was granted, leaving a portion of unalienated, and surrounded by several grants.AMCG, 1994, 9 The reserved land was formally declared a town by Governor Macquarie in December 1820 and named Campbelltown in honour of his wife (Elizabeth)'s family.AMCG, 1994, 9. William Bradbury (1774-1836) a native of Birmingham, was transported to NSW aboard the Guildford in 1812. His wife Elizabeth remained in England but his daughter, Mary (1797-1852) followed her father to Australia in 1815. Bradbury had no other children in NSW, though he established a relationship with a woman named Alice and in April 1836 married a Campbelltown widow, Catherine Patrick, n√©e Acres (c.1801-1883). Bradbury died two months later. Governor Macquarie visited Campbelltown in January 1822. He and his party ate a \\"hearty\\" breakfast at 'Bradbury's', indicating that Bradbury had built an inn. This was probably the inn later known as the Royal Oak, on the western side of the High Street. Macquarie noted in his journal that 'Bradbury is building a very good two storey brick house on his own farm and on a very pretty eminence immediately adjoining Campbell-Town as an inn for the accommodation of the public, and having asked me to give his farm a name, I have called it Bradbury Park. In 1826 Bradbury Park House was considered by William Dumaresq, inspector of roads and bridges, as the best building in Campbelltown when he reported on buildings suitable for military use. As the main street of Campbelltown, High Street or Sydney Road and later Queen Street, was at the edge of town, one side of the street was not within the town boundary while the other was. Canny traders soon realised that either side of the main road was as good as the other and leased or bought land from the grantees bordering the town proper. By the 1840s more than a few shops and hotels occupied the western side of the High Street. The coming of the railway in 1858 also aided in securing the commercial focus of the town on Queen Street. The Queen Street terraces were identified by Helen Baker (Proudfoot) in the early 1960s as a unique group of two-storey late Georgian vernacular buildings which were considered to form the only surviving late-1840s streetscape within the County of Cumberland. The buildings were acquired by the Cumberland County Council and its successors, the State Planning Authority and Department of Planning, to ensure their preservation.

It was established on 3 December 1982 and added to the former Australian Register of the National Estate on 30 June 1992. It was added to the Australian National Heritage List as part of the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves on 7 November 2008.  Description  Scabby Range Nature Reserve has an area of about and is located about north-east of Yaouk. The Scabby Range Nature Reserve lies adjacent to the south-western portion of the border of the Australian Capital Territory with New South Wales border abutting Namadgi National Park and the Bimberi Wilderness area. It complements these major reserves and shares much of their wilderness character. It embraces a range of subalpine communities which have developed on a rugged and elevated section of the Murrumbidgee granite batholith and adjacent Yaouk leucogranites and Ordovician metasediments. This elevated block is heavily dissected and forms the eastern continuation of the Kosciusko Uplands with contrasting lithology and physiography. It rises to c 1800m above the Yaouk/Cabramatta plain which is a cleared pastoral area lying 600m below. Average annual precipitation is of the order of 1,400mm, some of which falls as snow and with less reliable rainfall in summer when compared to winter precipitation receipt. Above 100mm snow banks may persist for more than 3‚Äì4 months amidst the giant tors, domes and rockshelves which dominate the landscape. The vegetation is clearly subalpine in character at the higher elevations, on the more exposed sites and along the cool air drainage lines, and on the lower slopes well developed montane open forest is extensive. The dominant association is one of alpine ash Eucalyptus delegatensis and mountain gum (Eucalyptus dalrympleana) with various inclusions of the peppermints (Eucalyptus radiata, Eucalyptus dives), manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis) and snowgum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) which frequently reach 30m in height. Alpine ash is the most prevalent species on slopes with a south-easterly aspect. Here it forms unusual uneven aged stands. Elsewhere on the more exposed, elevated sites, a range of low stature communities exists. Low woodland and tall shrubland of snowgum merges with open heathland of common shaggy pea Oxylobium ellipticumand alpine plum pine Podocarpus lawrencii and swamp heath of Epacris paludosa within polsters of Sphagnum christatum. In the lower depressions, often fringed by stands of black sallee Eucalyptus stellulataare snowgrass herbfields (dominated by Poa spp.) and sedgelands or Carex fens typified by the occurrence of Carex gaudichaudiana. Notable plant species occurrences include that of two rare or vulnerable shrubs, Australian anchor plant Discaria pubescensand an undescribed daisy bush (Olearia sp.2, Sentry Box Hill). Other notable plant species occurrences include that of the uncommon species Bossaiea procumbens, the existence of Acacia alpina on the higher western slopes of Sentry Box Hill (as representing the only wattle species to occur beyond the montane habitat), the association of the restricted Epacris robusta with the alpine shrub Westringia lucida and the fact that here Eucalyptus delegatensis forms unusually uneven aged stands (it normally occurs as a uniformly aged post fire response elsewhere). There is also a record of the restricted and rare Grevillia diminuta , the rare Viola improcera and a distinctive form of the alpine herb Montia australasica also exist in the area. These species are found associated with the rocky microsites of the reserve which support a large number of uncommon or restricted plant taxa. Faunal records for the reserve have not been published. Abundant populations of the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus hirsutus) are present. Other mammals noted as occurring within the reserve include species of antechinus (Antechinus stuartii, Antechinus swainsonii), at least two murid rodents (the southern bush rat, Rattus fuscipes and the uncommon broad toothed rat, Mastacomys fuscus), one possum species (the common ringtail, Pseudocheirus peregrinus peregrinus) and two macropods (the eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus, and red-necked wallaby, Macropus rufogriseus). More than 200 bird species are listed for Namadgi and would apply to scabby range also since the National Park surrounds this Nature Reserve. This avifauna is typical of tall sclerophyll forests and subalpine woodlands of the southern Monaro and adjacent highlands with rich representation of raptors, old world flycatchers, seasonal influxes of honeyeaters and parrots including the vulnerable glossy black cockatoo Calyptorhynchus lathami and poorly known yellow tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus funereus). Of note also is the fact that a significant portion of the area's birds move seasonally, overwintering at lower elevations and moving to the higher country such as the Scabby Range in summer. The reserve's herpetofauna is likely to comprise a small number of species consistent with the regional assemblage from cold, high altitude sites. Cool temperature tolerant elapids, a range of saxicoline and fossorial skinks and several species of cryptic, ground frequenting frogs (e.g., Ranidella spp., Limnodynastes tasmaniensis, etc.) make up the herpetofaunal assemblage of the Scabby Range. Mount Kelly at the reserve's northern apex, is an established focus for bushwalkers, affording outstanding panoramas of a scenic landscape with a distinctive wilderness quality. = Condition = Near natural condition although the ecosystems suffer from the presence of exotic animals, particularly rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and pigs Sus scrofa, and with feral horses Equus caballus occasionally damaging high altitude fens and seepages. The reserve, along with the more extensive Namadgi National Park and the Bimberi Range, constitutes an area with considerable wilderness value. (1989)  Heritage listing  The area has significant wilderness value as it comprises part of the core and buffer of an identified Bimberi Wilderness area. It embraces a panoramic collection of scenic peaks and spurlines. The reserve protects a good sample of well developed, minimally disturbed montane forests of mountain gum Eucalyptus dalrympleana and mountain ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis), with the latter species occurring in unusual uneven-aged stands on the south-easterly aspect slopes. Within the reserve, at higher elevations, is a significant group of low stature, subalpine communities including snowgum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) woodland and shrubland, open heathland, swamp heath and sedgeland particularly significant plant assemblages are found associated with the rock shelves, boulder jumbles and granite pavements. These accommodate a significant number of uncommon or restricted species. The nature reserve is the type locality for an undescribed species of daisy bush (Olearia sp. 2, Sentry Box Hill) and contains populations of the rare Australian anchor plant Discaria pubescens. Other notable plant occurrences include Acacia alpina, Bossaiea procumbens, Epacris robusta, Grevillea diminuta, a distinctive form of Montia australasica and Viola improcera. The reserve represents an area of outstanding scenic amenity with high biological value. Scabby Range Nature Reserve was listed on the Australian Register of the National Estate on 30 June 1992. However, the Register of the National Estate ceased to be a statutory heritage register on 2012, but is retained for archival and education purposes. It was listed on the Australian National Heritage List as part of the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves on 7 November 2008.  References  = Bibliography = * A.C.T.

His literary criticism ranged from the Renaissance to Modernist poetry, but he specialized in Shakespeare studies. His most famous work is probably An Approach to Shakespeare first published in 1938. Biography =Early life and education= Traversi was born in 1912 in Caersws in central Wales. His mother was the daughter of a Welsh doctor from Monmouthshire, and his father was a landed northern Italian gentleman. He spent his early years in Italy until the rise of fascism there compelled the family to return to the United Kingdom. Traversi was educated at Alleyn's School and Merton College, Oxford, where he earned his M.A. (1934) and B.Litt. (1937). At University College, London, he earned a B.A. with first class honors in Italian (1938). =Career= Uninterested in joining the common room of a British university, in 1939 Traversi took a position at the British Institute in Rome. While there he was arrested for disrespect to Mussolini. On the commencement of war, he returned to the UK, taking one of the last boats from France. Physically unfit for military service, Traversi instead was sent to the British Institute of Madrid where he forged a bond with the director and fellow Catholic Walter Starkie. It was during his stay in Spain that Traversi began submitting articles for the Catholic journals The Month, The Dublin Review and Blackfriars. The British government purposely sent British intellectuals, particularly Catholics, with the view to help keep Falangist-Spain neutral despite the propaganda dominance of Germany. Traversi had frequent close encounters with the Guardia Civil owing to his seeming to wander into officially prohibited areas. In 1943 Traversi set up the Barcelona branch of the British Institute, on Passeig de Gr√†cia, where he organized musical evenings, cocktail parties and conferences, for intellectuals and cultural figures like Carles Riba, Margot Fonteyn and Joan-Antoni Maragall i Noble.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Permanent European settlement in the Campbelltown area had begun in 1809 as an alternative to the flood-prone Hawkesbury district. Work on a road from Sydney to Liverpool was started in 1811. It was opened in August 1814 and was soon extended further south to Appin. This road, variously known as Campbelltown Road, Appin Road or the Sydney Road, passed through Campbelltown. The section through the town was called the High Street until the last decade of the 19th century when it was renamed Queen Street.Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1995, vol.2, 1-2. The land on which the Queen Street cottages stand was part of a grant of to Joseph Phelps in 1816. He had been working the land for some years before receiving formal title to it. Phelps was one of the farmers of Airds and Appin who subscribed funds for a Sydney courthouse in July 1813. His grant was seized, possibly as soon as it was formally issued, by the Provost Marshal, William Gore in lieu of payment by Phelps of debts totalling ¬£170. The land was auctioned in January 1817 to William Bradbury for ¬£100 plus twelve cattle and the grain produced from the crop growing on the land. Immediately north of Phelps' grant, Assistant Surveyor James Meehan had informally reserved for a village (AMCG, 1994 say \\"in 1815\\".) In 1816 most of the land in the area was granted, leaving a portion of unalienated, and surrounded by several grants.AMCG, 1994, 9. The reserved land was formally declared a town by Governor Macquarie in December 1820 and named Campbelltown in honour of his wife (Elizabeth)'s family. William Bradbury (1774-1836) a native of Birmingham, was transported to NSW aboard the Guildford in 1812. His wife Elizabeth remained in England but his daughter, Mary (1797-1852) followed her father to Australia in 1815. Bradbury had no other children in NSW, though he established a relationship with a woman named Alice and in April 1836 married a Campbelltown widow, Catherine Patrick, n√©e Acres (-1883). Bradbury died two months later. Governor Macquarie visited Campbelltown in January 1822. He and his party ate a \\"hearty\\" breakfast at 'Bradbury's', indicating that Bradbury had built an inn. This was probably the inn later known as the Royal Oak, on the western side of the High Street. Macquarie noted in his journal that 'Bradbury is building a very good two storey brick house on his own farm and on a very pretty eminence immediately adjoining Campbell-Town as an inn for the accommodation of the public, and having asked me to give his farm a name, I have called it Bradbury Park. In 1826 Bradbury Park House was considered by William Dumaresq, inspector of roads and bridges, as the best building in Campbelltown when he reported on buildings suitable for military use. As the main street of Campbelltown, High Street or Sydney Road and later Queen Street, was at the edge of town, one side of the street was not within the town boundary while the other was. Canny traders soon realised that either side of the main road was as good as the other and leased or bought land from the grantees bordering the town proper. By the 1840s more than a few shops and hotels occupied the western side of the High Street. The coming of the railway in 1858 also aided in securing the commercial focus of the town on Queen Street. The Queen Street terraces were identified by Helen Baker (Proudfoot) in the early 1960s as a unique group of two-storey late Georgian vernacular buildings which were considered to form the only surviving late-1840s streetscape within the County of Cumberland. The buildings were acquired by the Cumberland County Council and its successors, the State Planning Authority and Department of Planning, to ensure their preservation. =CBC Bank= Joseph Phelps was granted adjoining the future site of Campbelltown in 1816. His was one of a group of the first grants made that year. The subject property (the future 263 Queen Street) represents a small portion of the original grant. Phelps did not develop the portion of the grant that is the subject of this study. In fact no plan shows any development before 1881. Phelps increased his holdings to in 1817, and that year conveyed the larger property to Thomas Clarkson. It passed through several hands up to 1870, however it appears was not developed in any way. It was presumably used for agricultural purposes.AMCG, 1994, 14. Samuel Parker, blacksmith, bought the subject property as part of a larger parcel in 1870 from Charles Morris. Parker owned the adjoining property (south side) and appears to have worked and resided on the property. What use, if any, he made of the subject site is unclear (Parker's house can be seen to the left of the bank in an 1881-83 photograph). =The Commercial Banking Company= The Commercial Banking Company (CBC) of Sydney opened its first Campbelltown office in leased premises, McGuannes House at 286 Queen Street (across the road from no. 263) in 1874, with George L. Jones as manager. McGuannes House is separately listed on the State Heritage Register. It is owned by the Department of Environment & Planning and is at present leased as a doctor's surgery. AMCG (1994, 14) states that CBC bought the property (263 Queen Street) from Samuel Parker (not Morris) in 1876 and had the present building built in 1881. AMCG states that the bank's first permanent manager from 1874 was A. J. Gore, who served until he retired in 1904.Branch Manager's report, 100/85, 26 March 1985. The bank moved into its own premises at 263 Queen Street in 1881. This building (built between 1874 and 1881) was designed by the Mansfield Brothers who were important Victorian architects employed by the CBC Bank on a number of projects designing many bank chambers, examples surviving in many country towns. It is a fine and restrained Italianate style rendered and painted building symmetrically designed about a small portico. The bank sold a portion of the land it bought from Parker in 1880. The land was purchased in the name of the Queen for a new post office. That building was completed the same year as the CBC chambers. In 1959 the bank sold off another portion of its 1876 purchase to the Commowealth of Australia, presumably for the creation of a telephone exchange. The banking chamber has been altered, but it is understood that the building still contains a stone domed vault, and the original staircase and other joinery. There is a large yard behind the bank which contains a stable/ coach house, now used as a garage. The CBC sold the bank cahmbers and property at 263 Queen Street in 1986, moving to new premises (as the National Australia Bank). In recent times the former bank building at 263 Queen Street has been leased by a Pancake restaurant and is today (1994) used as the offices for a local newspaper.AMCG, 1994, 19  Description  ;Site: There is a large yard behind the bank which contains an 1874 stable/ coach house, now used as a garage. ;Bank: A fine and restrained Victorian Italianate style rendered and painted building symmetrically designed about a small portico. The banking chamber has been altered, but it is understood that the building still contains a stone domed vault, and the original staircase and other joinery. C-shaped building around a courtyard. It includes a stone-domed bank vault. = Condition = As at 8 July 2008, the banking chamber has been altered, but it is understood that the building still contains a stone domed vault, and the original staircase and other joinery. There is a large yard behind the bank which contains a stable/coach house, now used as a garage. = Modifications and dates = *1950s - extension on the north side to the rear, alteration with parapet walls to the existing string course level and fenestration in keeping with the old building's style. *1960s - newer commercial building built to the rear of the site - there is no physical connection between the buildings. *1985 - The banking chamber has been altered (original bank fittings removed), but it is understood that the building still contains a stone domed vault, and the original staircase and other joinery. There is a large yard behind the bank which contains a stable/ coach house, now used as a garage. *1985 - approval for internal modifications being removal of some existing walls, reuse of existing cedar joinery with additions to match, restoration of a magnificent plaster ceiling, over the former banking chamber. *1992 - major redevelopment in the former rear yard. 1874 Stables/coach house was demolished after being archivally recorded.  Heritage listing  As at 26 October 2011, The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney set up its first Campbelltown office in McGuannes House in 1874 and moved into its own premises at 263 Queen Street, in 1881. The Italianate style building was designed by Victoria's Mansfield Brothers, the architects responsible for a number of the bank's projects. The bank complements the old Post Office next door in period, scale and style and together these make an important contribution to this area of Queen Street.Press release, Michael Knight, MLA for Campbelltown, 19 April 1985.

It was formed in 1901 by the Jewish Agricultural Society. The Jewish Immigrant Information Bureau was founded in 1907 as an offshoot of the IRO. The IRO also had an uncertain relationship with the Jewish Territorial Organization, led by Israel Zangwill. Background Jewish individuals in the twentieth century were met with anti-Semitic attitudes in various places. In Spain and Portugal, they had previously been confronted by the Spanish Inquisition. The Inquisition forced Jewish individuals to renounce their faith and convert to Christianity, with the penalty of being exiled if they did not do so. Once Jews converted to Christianity, they were branded New Christians by the Spanish. This served to continuously single out the Jewish even when they attempted to assimilate completely to the society around them. In Romania Jewish people were faced with similar problems. These struggles caused major migration among Jewish groups. Establishment As a consequence of this increase in migration from Jewish groups, immigration records were created, and organizations were formed to facilitate the migration of Jewish individuals. A branch of the Jewish Agricultural Society called The Industrial Removal Office (IRO) was created in 1901 in order to help Jewish immigrants to integrate economically, culturally, and permanently into the affairs of American Society in the United States of America. Activities Agents from The Industrial Removal Office received applications from Jewish individuals and sent them to be reviewed by The New York Bureau, who then responded to The Industrial Removal Office with opportunities that fit their individual clients needs so as to promote a welcoming environment that provided its newcomers a more likely chance at long-term success in their new communities. Related groups The Jewish Immigrant Information Bureau (JIIB), which was established in 1907, was the branch of The Industrial Removal Office that met with these Jewish immigrants in Galveston and sent them to their new communities. The Jewish Immigrant Information Bureau also worked with The Jewish Territorial Organization (ITO), which was founded in 1905 and led by Israel Zangwill, in sending pamphlets to Europe to convince Russian Jews to come to the United States through the port of Galveston, furthering the goals of The Industrial Removal Office. These migrants were put in American communities with the intention of setting up larger Jewish communities around them through the eventual immigration of their friends and family. Israel Zangwill was hesitant at first in working with the Galveston Immigration Plan, which was furthered by The Industrial Removal Office and The Jewish Immigrant Information Bureau, because he did not want to send Jewish immigrants to a place where they could fully assimilate. This was because Israel Zangwill's beliefs were in support of the Zionist movement which advocated for the return of Jewish people to their motherland in Israel. Israel Zangwill wanted a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Later history With a financial depression in 1907, The Industrial Removal Office was forced to increase the advertisement of their operations and send its agents further away. However, the offices which were in less populated areas of the United States, or were most affected, like Philadelphia and Boston, had to temporarily close at the end of the depression. Following this, and World War I, The Industrial Removal Office was left with very low funds and consequently a decreased reach prompting it to dissolve in 1922.

It was built from 1860 to 1862 by Richard Watson. It is also known as Robin Hood Inn and Waratah Dairies. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Infrastructure, a department of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Robin Hood Farm is closely associated with the Robin Hood Inn which was established in 1830 on part of the Campbellfields Estate subdivision. Although a number of buildings existed on the Robin Hood Farm estate at this time, no farmhouse as such is recorded. The first license to the inn was issued to Thomas Humphreys in 1830, who was also overseer of a nearby property \\"Varroville\\". The Inn's license passed through various hands until 1845 when it was issued to Richard Watson who held it until 1860. It would appear that some time around 1858 Watson had taken up farming, most likely dairying, on the adjacent property which became known as Robin Hood Farm. The coming of the railway may have been a factor in Watson's decision to move from the Inn to the farm. Watson appears to have left the farm by 1867 and the farm changed hands numerous times until 1912 when Fred Moore, a Campbelltown grazier, purchased the property. Moore purchased many of the surrounding parcels of land which were eventually consolidated into a single land holding of , subsequently transferred to his wife, Victoria Moore. In the early twentieth century both Robin Hood Farm and nearby Varroville Farm were dairies. The Smith Brothers of Concord leased both from W. H. Staniforth of St. Andrews.Morris & Britton, 2000, 97 The Moores left the farm in 1932 but continued to lease it as a dairy farm until 1959 (1923 Percy, Austin and Arthur Smith (Smith Bros), dairymen of Concord operated dairies at Robin Hood Farm and Varroville until 1958, running their own dairy herd and purchasing milk from local farmers'Liston, 107. when Victoria, by then a widow, subdivided and sold most of the land to Frank Wolstenholme Pty Ltd (later Reid Murray Developments Pty Ltd). The lot containing the farmhouse was sold to Frank Lopresti, a grocer from Lakemba in October 1959. The farm was acquired by the State Planning Authority in October 1968. In 1969 architect John Fisher (member of the Institute of Architects, the Cumberland County Council Historic Buildings Committee and on the first Council of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) after its reformation in 1960) was commissioned by the State Planning Authority to restore the first five houses in Campbelltown, which had been resumed under the Cumberland County Planning Scheme. They included Glenalvon House.Lucas & McGinness, 2012.  Description  A two-storey house of Georgian design, with a distinctive silhouette. The walls of the ground floor rooms fill in the ends of the front verandah forming rooms known as \\"out-shuts\\". The roof is galvanised iron, hipped with boxed eaves and a well proportioned chimney at both ends. A striking circular silo stands near the main building. The farmhouse was originally believed to have been built in the 1830s but recent research would suggest that the farm was built some 20‚Äì30 years later but after an earlier pattern. The conservation of the building took it back to its original form, stripping away the years of additions. Prior to the building's restoration, the National Trust listing of the building noted that the building contained much original external joinery. The conservation work not only removed the \\"years of additions,\\" but appears to have removed some of the original joinery and the original wooden columns to the front verandah. Apart from the farmhouse there are few remaining building elements from the original farm complex left. These include a brick silo, with conical corrugated iron roof that is in urgent need of stabilisation, and the remnants of the Dairy, including a brick cool room with original door, which has been altered to dormitory and office accommodation. There is a narrow gauge rail line set in the cement floor of the dairy which was probably used for transporting large feed bins from one end of the dairy to the other. = Condition = As at 28 January 1999, the house is in excellent condition, however, the remnants of the barn structure need to be examined before any further changes are carried out. The silo is in poor condition and needs urgent stabilisation. The main building has been extensively conserved. The exterior can be considered to be intact in its substantially original form whilst the interior can be considered to be intact in layout and partially intact in fitout. = Modifications and dates = Conversion of site to Odyssey House - , following conservation works under the guidance of Howard Tanner. = Further information = A conservation plan for the site was prepared in 1988. As ten years have elapsed since this study was undertaken, it is recommended that the study be updated. The updated plan should address the impact of the \\"conservation works\\" on the significant fabric of the building and the impact of the demolition of the barn on the site's overall significance.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2000, Robin Hood Farm has high significance as a surviving mid nineteenth century farm house. It has a distinctive layout and configuration not represented by other buildings in the area. Together with the surviving villas and farmhouses between Liverpool and Campbelltown, Robin Hood Farm demonstrates the variety of agricultural uses of the area and the use of the area as a rural retreat from the earliest days of white settlement. It provides evidence of the changing use and altered intensity of occupation of the area and particularly the shift from cereal cropping to dairying. Robin Hood Farm was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Robin Hood Farm is of historical significance as a rare surviving early dairy farm. It is of further significance for its association with Robin Hood Inn, one of the earliest social institutions in the district and for its association with Robert Watson, an early settler and pastoralist in the area. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Robin Hood Farm has high aesthetic significance as an unusually designed and well detailed early farmhouse building associated with early dairy farming activities in the Campbelltown district. The associated out buildings, in particular the silo, are also of high aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Robin Hood Farm has high social significance through its links to early settlement and pastoral activities in the Campbelltown district. It has further social significance for its association with the Watson family, a prominent local family and for its association with the Robin Hood Inn, one of the earliest social institutions in the district. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Robin Hood Farm is of high technical/research significance for its demonstration of mid-nineteenth century building techniques. It is of further significance for its demonstration of early farming and dairying techniques as represented by the extant outbuildings and silo. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Robin Hood Farm is one of few surviving mid-nineteenth century dairy farms both in the Campbelltown district and the wider Sydney Metropolitan region.

Early life and education  Mary Frances Lucas was born in Gravesend on 15 August 1885. Lucas entered the London School of Medicine for Women in the winter of 1904, and graduated in 1911.  Medical career  At the outbreak of war in 1914, she was invited back to the London School of Medicine for Women as assistant to the professor of anatomy, Frederic Wood Jones. His wartime work at the military hospital in Shepherd's Bush meant that increasingly Lucas was left on her own to run the department. During two summer vacations she went with the Dean of the school, Louisa Aldrich-Blake, to volunteer at Royaumont Abbey in northern France, where the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service ran a large hospital for casualties. In 1916 she married Richard Keene, and in 1919 was appointed head of department when Wood Jones moved to Manchester. After the war, Keene spent most of her career working in the anatomy department. Her roles included lecturer, senior demonstrator and head of department. In 1924 she was appointed Professor of Anatomy: it was widely reported at the time that she was the world's first female professor of anatomy. She was elected president of the Medical Women's Federation and held the role from 1946-48. In 1956 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.  Death and legacy  Mary Frances Lucas Keene died 9 May 1977 in Dover.  Published Works  * M. F. Lucas Keene, E. E.

In 1887, the city purchased land for a new station and hired local architect Martin W. Roberts to design a new station. Contractor Alexander Robbins of Kalamazoo constructed the station, and it was in use by the end of 1887.

It was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 22 January 2016.  History  The Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks \\"... have an earlier history and are part of Aboriginal trails, trade and custom. Neither has ever been a single fixed route for long. Over time, the footprint and hoofprint trails of both tracks have shifted, wavered and at times disappeared, to revive again later\\".Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.15 It is generally accepted that Australia's desert regions have been occupied since approximately 40,000-30,000 BP.Smith, M., Veth, P., Hiscock, P., Wallis l., 2005 In the preliminary assessment area archaeologists have found some sites that are between 12,000 and 15,000 years old.Symons n.d.:18 Prior to the establishment of 19th century European and Afghan settlements in the region, evidence exists which points to Aboriginal people from fourteen or more language groups moving through and living in the rugged arid lands of central Australia. The Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks extend over various Aboriginal territories including those of the Yandruwandha people (including Innamincka), Diyari people (Dieri), Dhirari people, Wonkangurru, Ngamini, Gawarawarga, Garanguru and Yarlijandi.McBryde, I. 1987p.253-8 John King did not record information about the language or identity of the people who saved his life except that they knew the word \\"whiteman\\", which suggests a degree of prior knowledge and possibly contact with Europeans. News of the arrival of people from Europe, Asia and elsewhere could have arrived through the network of traditional routes whereby goods and cultural knowledge were communicated far and wide across the continent. In this region \\"networks of contact between individuals and groups allowed prized goods to be distributed across the region\\" including red ochre, gypsum for rain making ceremonies, hardwoods and softwoods, stone axe heads, shells, weapons and tools.McBryde 1997 p.256-259 The waters of Strzelecki Creek, the Cooper Creek system and the Great Artesian Basin dictated the cultural geography and survival. The movement along these routes not only allowed for the distribution of objects, resources and goods, but also culture. The movement helped to establish important relationships between groups, and connection with country as the rituals, ceremonies and myths that reinforced them (the trade routes) were of great social importance. These trade routes and tracks were used by Indigenous Australians for thousands of years and many tracks remain culturally significant today. Non- Indigenous people utilised Indigenous pathways in their attempts to explore and settle this part of the country. The Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks were used as stock routes for overlanding sheep and cattle from the centre of Australia to southern markets. The tracks became the traditional transport corridors across the north-east of South Australia, to the east of Lake Eyre and connected the former railhead at Marree to the Channel Country of south- western Queensland. Some of ancient trade routes \\"now form the origin of the highways where modern tourists now travel\\".Donavan & Wall 2004 p.ix = Early Exploration in the centre of Australia = Routes of Eyre (1840 and 1841) In 1839 and 1840 Edward Eyre, supported by the recently established government in Adelaide, travelled into northern South Australia in search of grazing land. Each of the colonies was very interested in the great unknown which was central and northern Australia. The reports made by Eyre were disappointing; he travelled past the Flinders Ranges to discover a horseshoe of impassable salt lakes: LakeTorrens, Lake Eyre, Lake Blanche, Lake Callabonna and Lake Frome. Eyre's expedition coincided with a dry period; from the aptly named \\"Mount Hopeless\\" he described inland South Australia as a \\"dreary waste\\".Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.23-24 In 1844 Charles Sturt followed Eyre and discovered the Strzelecki Creek which he named after his colleague, Paul Edmond de Strzelecki, and the main watercourses which fed Lake Eyre: Cooper Creek, Eyre Creek and the Georgina River. Sturt failed to realise the significance of his discoveries and corroborated Eyre's reports that the region would not support grazing. The thirst of pastoralists for new grazing land in South Australia was unquenchable. Graziers began squatting past the surveyed boundaries of the northern frontier. They were frustrated by the slow pace of government surveys and the land tenure principles of the Wakefield Plan which favoured landownership over leasehold. In 1842 the South Australian Legislative Council broke away from the Wakefield Plan by passing An Act to Protect the Waste Lands of the Crown from Encroachment, Intrusion and Trespass. This act allowed pastoralists to lease land on an annual renewable basis based on a system of sight-lines between landmarks rather than formal survey.Love 1986 p.4 cited in Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.24-25 This provided a degree of security for pastoralists and allowed the government to collect revenue from the lease agreements. In 1851 the Waste Lands Act was enacted which extended leases from one year to fourteen years and an incentive scheme was introduced which gave preferential leasing rights to the discoverer of new grazing land.Gee 2000 p.7 cited in Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.25 A number of other changes also supported pastoral expansion in South Australia during the 1850s: a decade of high rainfall, the high price of wool, and the availability of easy finance thanks to the wealth created by the gold rush.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.25 Water, geographic and climactic knowledge of the Birdsville and Strzelecki region improved in the 1850s thanks to a series of expeditions and discoveries made by Benjamin Herschel Babbage, Sir Augustus Gregory, John Stuart and Peter Warburton. Benjamin Herschel Babbage, 1873 In 1856 Babbage, an engineer searching for gold, discovered two permanent waterholes in the MacDonnell River that led him to believe that he could pass Eyre's impassable horseshoe. In 1858 Babbage and Warburton discovered the Mound Springs and the following year John Stuart discovered a permanent waterhole known today as Stuart Creek.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.26 In 1858 Sir Augustus Gregory was asked by the NSW Government to search for the missing explorer, Ludwig Leichhardt, who in 1846 set out on an expedition to cross the continent from east to west and was never seen again.Tolcher 1986 p.25 After the search for Leichhardt was abandoned, Gregory travelled into South Australia via the Strzelecki Creek and dispelled Eyre's impassable horseshoe theory.Feeken et al. 1970 p.130 These discoveries led to a wave of pastoral expansion in the Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks region. By the middle of the 19th century Europeans had explored large parts of the Australian continent but had failed to cross the country from south to north. The need to connect the isolated settlements of the north coast, facilitate trade and communication with the rest of the world and secure grazing land culminated in a race between South Australia and Victoria across the continent.Tolcher 1986 p.28Favenc 1983 p.203 In the early 19th century three theories existed about what lay at the heart of Australia: a vast desert, an inland sea or a great river.Cathcart 1999 p.232 The drawing up of colonial boundaries in 1860 had left a large tract of unclaimed land on the northern coast of Australia. The land remained nominally a part of New South Wales who showed little interest in exploring and opening it up. Visions of rich grazing land and other natural assets piqued the interest of Queensland, South Australia and Victoria who each set about claiming it for themselves.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.30 South Australia and Queensland both made submissions to the Colonial Office to have the land incorporated into their territory or alternatively divided between them. Victoria was a small colony which had expanded to its territorial limits, and with no adjacent unclaimed land looked to the north to fulfil its ambitions.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.31 The gold rush of the 1850s had enabled Victoria to amass a substantial wealth that led to the creation of numerous scientific and cultural societies such as the Royal Society of Victoria. The mystery of Australia's centre was at odds with Victoria's new sense of cultural and scientific sophistication. Victorian hubris refused to let the mystery remain unsolved and the Royal Society of Victoria set about filling in the blanks on the map of Australia by organising an expedition which would cross the continent from south to north.Murgatroyd 2002 p.23-24 Sixth Stuart Expedition party, 1861 The race to discover the centre of Australia and claim the northern land was between South Australia and Victoria. The South Australian government offered a reward of ¬£2,000 for the first successful crossing to the north coast of Australia. In March 1860 John McDouall Stuart set out from Chambers Creek and travelled north past the Mound Springs system and passed through the MacDonnell Range which he named after the then Governor of South Australia.Favenc 1983 p.205 Stuart and his party arrived at Tennant Creek in June 1860 but were pushed back by the hostile environment.Favenc 1983 p.206-207 In 1861 Stuart and his party of ten men and forty-seven horses attempted a second crossing of the continent, well aware that Burke and Wills had already set off from Victoria with the same goal in mind. Stuart was again turned back and returned to Adelaide suffering blindness. Stuart recovered and within the month launched another expedition. On 24 July 1862 Stuart and his party reached the north coast of Australia at the Arafura Sea. Stuart had discovered a route from south to north. His expedition had enormous implications for both South Australia and Australia.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.29 Stuart retired soon after and returned to England but his years of exploration caught up with him and he died three years later. = The Burke and Wills Expedition 1860-1861 = Royal Park from where the expedition departed, a memorial commemorates the event Melbourne was 23 years old in 1858, and had been established as the Colony of Victoria for just seven years. Citizens of the Australian colonies at that time knew very little of the \\"ghastly blank\\" in the centre of the continent. In 1860 the Royal Society of Victoria established the Exploration Committee. The committee was a consortium of Victoria's scientific, social and economic elite charged with organising the Victorian Exploring Expedition. The Victorian Exploring Expedition was the most \\"lavishly equipped exploration party in Australian history\\" assembled for the purpose of crossing the continent and incorporating the unclaimed grazing land into its territory. The Victorian Exploring Expedition was posthumously renamed the \\"Burke and Wills Expedition\\". The expedition involved 19 men, 26 camels, 23 horses, and several supply wagons. Portrait of Robert O'Hara Burke, by William Strutt, 1860 The expedition was led by Robert Burke, an Irish superintendent, who was \\"...a product of that heroic age of empire which believed that a gentleman of good breeding with a confident military manner and an impressive beard must make an effective leader\\". Burke was a hot tempered man known for his penchant for gambling and the opposite sex.Murgatroyd 2002 p.57, 67 Burke's prowess did not extend to the field of exploration and was notorious for not having a sense of direction. A local newspaper once wrote that Burke \\"could not tell the north from the south in broad daylight, and the Southern Cross as a guide was a never ending puzzle to him\\".Murgatroyd 2002 p.66 During the process of selecting an expedition leader, rival factions emerged within the Exploration Committee who each championed their own man. Burke's appointment was highly controversial and attracted criticism from the media who questioned his experience and suitability for the position.Murgatroyd 2002 p.72 William John Wills The members of the expedition party generally fell into two categories; the scientists and the labourers.Murgatroyd 2002 p.73 The scientific members of the party included William Wills who was the party's surveyor, meteorological and astronomical observer and originally the third-in-command. Wills was a talented and devout scientist who had a passion for the Australian outback; his cool and collected manner helped to balance out Burke's temper and capricious nature.Murgatroyd 2002 p.80 Dr Hermann Beckler was the medical officer and botanist. Ludwig Becker completed the scientific contingent and was recruited for the position of naturalist.Feeken et al. 1970 p.167 The Exploration Committee, conscious of Stuart's expeditions, ordered the party to travel quickly; a directive at odds with the amount of equipment being transported which reportedly included twelve sets of dandruff brushes, four enema kits, a large bathtub and an oak and cedar table complete with stools.Murgatroyd 2002 p.94-95 The equipment was estimated to weigh in excess of 20 tonnes including food that was expected to last two years. The expedition set out from Royal Park in Melbourne on 20 August 1860 to considerable fanfare from around 15,000 spectators.Phoenix 2012 p501 The party consisted of 22 men however by the time of its final reorganisation at Menindee in October 1860, some 30 men had been employed. A stone cairn that marks the expedition's departure point from Royal Park was erected in 1890 and is located at the corner of The Avenue and Macarthur Road.The University of Melbourne 2008 Controversy followed the party every step of the way and by the time they arrived in Menindee, their spirits were low. Along the way some of the men had been fired or had resigned whilst others had been recruited.Murgatroyd 2002 p.118 The trundling party took a staggering 56 days to make the 750 kilometre journey to Menindee. The expedition was experiencing financial hardship and had begun to auction its supplies in an effort to raise funds and increase speed.Murgatroyd 2002 p.106-117Tolcher 1986 p.28-29 George Landells was originally appointed as second-in-command and was responsible for importing the camels and communicating with their foreign handlers. Landells and Burke had a number of arguments which resulted in a challenge to a pistol duel and Landells resignation. Wills was promoted by Burke to replace Landells as the second in command of the expedition. From the outset the expedition relied on Aboriginal guides and messengers to assist their progress. Becker's third report notes: \\"We left Terickenkom (north of Balranald as they headed towards the Darling) at 11 a.m. and marched slowly over a heavy ground. A black fellow guided us through the Mallee scrub however the old track was visible enough even for a white fellows eye\\". Wills' diary of 22 and 23 September acknowledge Aboriginal guides \\"Martin the black fellow\\" and \\"a guide from Eungin \\"Simon\\" a blackfellow who took us along an out station track\\". A few days later Dr Beckler recorded that his wagon group left Cole's water hole (known as Cole Lagoon north of Swan Hill NSW) on 24 September. \\"Marched at 71/4am in a N.W by N. Direction. A young native, acting as a guide, sat on one of the wagons, while his uncle Whitepepper (Watpiba) the \\"old man\\"... walked in front of us with a fire-stick in one hand and a yam-stick in the other\\". Becker's fourth report of 25 September notes he \\"learned that Mr Burke has send [sic] a black-fellow with a message to Dr Beckler, and the Native advised him to take another, a shorter, trip through the bush, the road I have taken being a longer one. Having lost my way in the open plain I was by this saved from being bushed for the night, as I never could have met in time my fellow travellers\\".Becker 1860  The Menindee Depot  Burke established a depot at Menindee under the charge of Dr Beckler. Burke instructed the Menindee party to construct a fortified supply depot and await further instructions. Burke's \\"advanced party\\" would travel north to locate a suitable site for the second supply depot that would support the final leg of the expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Whilst in Menindee, Burke procured the services of an experienced bushman named William Wright who acted as a guide to the remainder of the expedition party on their journey towards Cooper Creek. The Menindee party, under the leadership of Dr Beckler, consisted of Dr Ludwig Becker (artist, naturalist, and geologist); William Hodgkinson (artist); Alexander McPherson (saddler); Myles Lyons (trooper); and Belooch Khan (cameleer). Wright later recruited Charles Stone (an 'experienced bushman'); William Purcell (depot cook) and John Smith, a part-Aboriginal bushman (cameleer). On 10 November 1860 Lyons and McPherson set out from Menindee, accompanied by the Aboriginal tracker known to them as \\"Dick\\", to follow Burke's trail and pass him urgent despatches from the Exploration Committee in Melbourne. Dick guided the party as far as Torowoto but as the weeks past and they failed to find Burke, they ran short of water and supplies. The party had travelled over 400 miles and their horse had died. Their situation compelled them to give up their search for Burke and return to their camp. Lyons and McPherson became increasingly weakened and Dick realised they were unfit to travel. He left the pair in the care of some Aboriginal people near Torowoto and returned to the Menindee Depot to raise the alarm. Dr Beckler's diary notes that \\"he: saw a native approaching our camp... it must be Mountain (Dick)... His previously fall [sic] face was sunken, his tottering legs could hardly carry him, his feet were raw...\\".Beckler 1993 p.48 Under orders from Wright, Dr Beckler set out on 21 December to find McPherson and Lyons, accompanied by Belooch and the Aboriginal, Peter, \\"to whom Mountain (Dick) had described our route as well as possible\\".Tipping 1979 p.107 Duroadoo, sketched by Hermann Beckler, 1861 > Two of the natives that had accompanied Burke for a good stretch from > Duroadoo (Torowoto) (north of the first main camp at Menindee NSW)] came to > us after Dick had spoken to them and they promised us some water fowl.

Dick was later presented with a medal (breast plate) and five sovereigns at a ceremony in Melbourne. An extract from The Bendigo Advertiser (26 September 1861) records \\"On Monday afternoon (23 September 1861) at the Hall of the Royal Society, His Excellency Henry Barkly, in the presence of several gentlemen, presented Dick... with a brass plate and chain and five sovereigns... Dick. I understand this has been given to you by the Queen's Government for rescuing Trooper Lyons and Saddler McPherson\\". It was fitting that this award, the only bravery award made as a result of the expedition, should have been made to an Aboriginal person.Dodd 2013 p. 93  The Fort Wills Depot  Fort Wills Burke's advanced party consisted of William John Wills (surveyor, astronomical observer and second-in-command), John King (assistant and cameleer), Charles Gray (horse and supply handler and cook), William Brahe, William Patten and Thomas McDonough (assistants) and Dost Mahomet (cameleer). William Wright (now third-in-command) travelled with the advance party as far as Torowoto to find water and the best course northwards before being sent back to Menindee by Burke to command the supply party. Wright along with two Aboriginal boys, Dick and an unnamed boy acted as guides for the party. The party made a total of eight camp sites as they travelled northwards along the Cooper Creek. They established the Fort Wills Depot on 11 November on the northern bank of the Bulloo Bulloo Waterhole. At Fort Wills, Burke once again split the party, forming his gulf party that would make its final dash to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Burke placed Brahe in charge of the \\"depot party\\" and instructed him to construct a fort to hold the remaining ammunition and supplies. Burke ordered Brahe to wait for the gulf party at Fort Wills for three months or until their supplies had been exhausted. Brahe was then to return to the Menindee Depot. Wills secretly instructed Brahe to wait for four months. Before leaving, Burke cautioned Brahe to have minimal contact with the Aboriginal people and use force if necessary to deter them. Despite this, local Aboriginal people visited the camp regularly and exchanged food and goods; there were incidences of occasional petty thieving. Brahe and the men under his charge remained at Fort Wills for four months. During this time they constructed a timber stockade to protect their supplies. The friendly overtures of the Aboriginal people that frequented the camp were often repelled by European gunfire.Tolcher 1986 p.30 During the time that Brahe was at the depot he \\"shouted at, physically hit or fired on Aborigines on four occasions\\".Brahe 1861 Brahe's diary of 16 December notes that: \\"a large tribe of blacks came pestering us to go to their camp and have a dance, which we declined. They were very troublesome, and nothing but the threat to shoot them will keep them away\\". The Aboriginal people often persisted with efforts to engage with the explorers. Brahe noted: \\"Blacks passing now and then offering us nets and fish; we made it a rule never to accept the least thing from them, but made some of them little presents of left off clothes\\".  The Gulf Party  John King, circa 1861 On 16 December 1860, in the height of summer, the forward party consisting of Burke, Wills, John King and Charles Gray left the Fort Wills depot along with six camels, one horse and three months' worth of supplies. Despite Burke's resolve to refrain from contact with Aboriginal people, his party continued to engage with and rely on Aboriginal hospitality as he passed through their country. Wills' Field Book 1 of 16 December notes: \\"There was a large camp of not less than forty or fifty black near where we stopped. They brought us presents of fish, for which we gave them some beads, and matches. These fish we found to be a most valuable addition to our rations \\".Wills 1860 \\"Burke, Wills and King on the way back from the Gulf of Carpentaria\\", by Nicholas Chevalier, 1868 Rather than being aggressive, both the Yandruwandha, on the Cooper, and the Diyari closer to Lake Eyre were hospitable, shared food and generally attempted to draw the Europeans into a web of relations through invitations of a social or sexual nature.Allen 2013 Four days after the journey to the Gulf had begun; Burke observed further attempts by the Aboriginal people to extend social relations to include the explorers, noting, \\"we found a great many natives. They presented us with fish, and offered their women\\".Burke and Wills 1861 p.32 Wills' field journal notes that as the explorers neared the Gulf of Carpentaria they: > ...came to a channel through which the sea water enters. Here we passed > three blacks, who, as is universally their custom, pointed out to us, > unasked, the best part down. This assisted us greatly, for the ground we > were taking was very boggy.Wills 1861 On 10 February 1861 Burke's party reached the tidal channel, technically fulfilling their objective of traversing the country, but were unable to cross dense mangrove swamps and reach the sea. Tired and hungry, they failed to leave a monument of their achievement, but instead contemplated the long march back to Fort Wills with only a quarter of their supplies remaining. The race to the north was for their glory, the march back south was for their survival.Murgatroyd 2002 p.212-213, 217-218Tolcher 1986 p.30-31 On the return leg of their journey to Fort Wills, Burke had to introduce strict rationing. The humid conditions of the tropics gave way to the dry heat of the desert and the men's strength began to ebb away.Feeken et al. 1970 p.168 As the supplies dwindled, animals were slaughtered and equipment abandoned. By the end of March they were desperately short of provisions, killing their camel and drying the meat for supplies. Gray became ill and stole some flour for which he was severely beaten by Burke. Gray died from hunger and exhaustion on 17 April and the party stopped for a day to bury him before continuing south.  The return to Fort Wills  As the deadline came and went, Brahe became increasingly anxious as scurvy and hunger spread through the camp. Brahe abandoned Fort Wills on the morning of 21 April, four months and one week after their arrival, believing Burke and his party must have perished or turned to Queensland for their return journey home. Brahe's party left for Menindee after burying supplies near a tree and blazing a message that indicated the location of the supplies in its trunk. The exact wording and content of the message has been subject to considerable debate over the years.Murgatroyd 2002 p.231Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.316Phoenix & Corke 2012 p.4-10 In an extraordinary twist of fate, Burke, Wills and King arrived at the Cooper Creek depot on the afternoon of 21 April only to discover that the camp had been abandoned by Brahe's party just nine hours earlier. Their weakened state prevented them from attempting to catch up with them. Searching the camp they discovered the Dig Tree message and recovered the small cache of supplies.Tolcher 1986 p.31Favenc 1983 p.214Murgatroyd 2002 p.231-232 Burke, Wills and King debated their options. Wills and King were in favour of retracing their steps to Menindee which was 650 km away. Burke suggested making the 240 km trip down the Strzelecki Creek to Mount Hopeless Station.Tolcher 1986 p.32 The three men recuperated at the depot, before heading south down the Strzelecki Track towards South Australia and Mt Hopeless Station on 22 April. They continued to receive friendly overtures from the Aboriginal people in the area. On 24 April Wills' diary records: > As we about to start this morning some blacks came by from whom we were > fortunate enough to get about twelve pounds of fish for a few pieces of > straps and some matches, &c.; This is a great treat for us as well as a > valuable addition to our rations. Nardoo, an aquatic fern On 30 May, at Burke's request, Wills returned to Fort Wills to check for signs of disturbance from the other parties. Incomprehensibly, Wills also failed to notice any evidence of a recent visit to the depot by Wright and Brahe who had doubled back on the off chance that the gulf party had returned to the depot. Wills buried his field books and left a note before returning to Burke and King. Burke, Wills and King were exhausted and continued to weaken steadily despite holding some remaining supplies and having regular exchanges of fish, wild ducks, nardoo and other foodstuffs with the Yandruwandha. After departing Fort Wills, Burke, Wills and King travelled south down Cooper Creek, accepting assistance from Aboriginal people in the form of fresh fish and nardoo. Nardoo is an aquatic fern, resembling a four-leaf clover which was ground to a flour and mixed with water to form an edible \\"porridge\\". Wills notes on 24 May \\"Started with King to celebrate the Queen's birthday by fetching from Nardoo Creek what is now to us the staff of life\\".Wills 1863 The party subsisted on this diet, which required a considerable amount of preparation and offered little nutritional value. As their supplies dwindled they became more and more dependent on the hospitality extended to them by Aboriginal people.Murgatroyd 2002 p.264  Koorliatto Creek  Bulla or Koorliatto, view from the camp up and down the Creek, by Hermann Beckler, 1861 Meanwhile, Wright had returned to Menindee as per Burke's instruction to transport the remaining supplies to Fort Wills. Wright took a considerable amount of time to execute his duties because Beckler refused to accept his command until it was officially approved by the Exploration Committee.Favenc 1983 p.211Murgatroyd 2002 p.138, 159, 196 After Wright's position was endorsed and additional funds were sent, he began to make his way to Fort Wills. Several members of the Menindee party, including Beckler, died during the trip. Severe illness began to take a toll on the members of the supply party as the full heat of summer began to take effect and water in the clay pans almost disappeared. Along the way they continued to seek out water sources for themselves and their animals, placing increasing pressure on the dwindling water resources and reportedly causing the local Aboriginal groups to become resentful. At Koorliatto Creek several groups of Aboriginal people tried unsuccessfully to move them on, at one point offering to show them the track to find Burke. One man was so impressive and courteous that Wright gave him a cap and shirt and from then on he was named \\"Mr Shirt\\". These visits became a regular occurrence. \\"Bands often visited the camp, signifying the ground to be theirs, and ordering us to move away. All these demonstrations, in the present state of my party, gave me much anxiety, and I felt anxious to obtain additional stores for recruiting the sick and effectually supplying the advance party. I instructed Mr Hodgkinson, therefore to start for Menindie on the 18th instant, with Belooch and seven of the camels, to escort Mr Becker and Purcell to that township, and having engaged two men in their places, to return as quickly as possible with stores\\".Wright 1861 At Poria Creek (southeast of Bulloo on the QLD border side) Wright reflected: \\"During the period included between the above dates (between 21 and 26 March) I spelled the party at the creek, hoping that the men would in some degree regain their health. I regret to state, however, that I had little reason to congratulate myself upon the results. Mr Becker and Purcell became much worse and utterly unable to walk about, and Smith and Stone did not at all improve, though energetically discharging their respective duties \\". Despite the availability of good water supplies and fresh food members of the party continued to weaken. Wright recorded on Friday 5 April to Wednesday 17 April that: \\"Trying to locate Cooper's Creek. I found Bulloo watercourse to consist of a large sheet of water, extending some five miles to the north of our camp... Fish of a considerable size were caught by the party; and at the northern termination of the waterhole, where the creek branched with insignificant channels, numbers of ingeniously constructed fishing dams showed that the natives derived a considerable sustenance from its waters\\". On 22 April Wright's diary records that a group of Aboriginal people at Bulloo were becoming increasingly hostile in their attempts to move the explorers on from their campground: \\"violently gesticulating, making signs that they were hungry, and that we were camped upon their ground', disturbing their tents and medicine supplies, throwing boomerangs carelessly upon the ground near his brother warriors. Throughout this scene Stone, though dying, behaved with great intrepidity, raising himself upon his bed and aiming his revolver at the natives when they approached him\\". Stone died that evening and was buried near the camp and Purcell died the following day, the doctor noting \\"For some days past he had been so weak as to faint after drinking a little water, and we had long been expecting his decease\\". Wright's diary entry on 27 April records a \\"skirmish\\" at Koorliatto Creek in which Mr Shirt and one other were severely wounded. > About eleven o'clock the cry of \\"natives!\\" started us to our feet...a body > of natives, numbering between forty and fifty, could be seen advancing > towards us from the west.... I saw plainly that they meant mischief, as they > were all painted, and bore more spears than we had seen on any former > occasion... they quickened their pace into a run, exciting each other with > war cries.... \\"Shirt,\\" accompanied by two other leaders, was in the van, and > despite all my motions for them to stop, had approached within a few yards > of us before I gave the order to fire \\". Wright at this point \\"resolved to quit Bulloo immediately\\". At the end of April Brahe's party stumbled upon the survivors of Wright's party and joined his camp. After resting for several days Brahe and Wright decided to return to Fort Wills in the hope that Burke's party may have returned. They arrived at the depot on 8 May but incredibly they did not check the buried cache of goods near the Dig Tree, and failed to notice any sign that Burke's party had recently returned to the camp. On their return, they found Patten was extremely ill and McDonough was limping from a damaged knee, and horses and camels were lost. On 1 May the party, now consisting of 9 expedition members, 21 horses and 16 camels, departed Bulloo for the Darling River and their journey home. They stopped at Koorliatto Creek camp site to the give the invalids and animals an opportunity to recuperate and to construct a suitable bed to transport Patten. As they slowly trundled southwards the group continued to meet and barter with Aboriginal people along the track. \\"I several times met a small body of natives, camped down the creek, and presented them with a tomahawk in return for some fish which they gave me\\". On 13 June Wright notes at Tirltawinge south of Torowoto: \\"The natives remained near us, and were very solicitous to assist us\\". The deep sense of duty and honour entrenched in the men, as they surely feared for their health and their lives seems incongruous in hindsight. Wright's diary on 15 June notes: > I had the honor, on the Friday following, to despatch Mr Brahe with a > summary of this diary, and Mr Burke's despatches, addressed to the > Committee, and I trust that the celerity with which I forward the messenger > will be sufficient excuse for its imperfect compilation and clerical > deficiencies\\". Around 19 June Wright and Brahe, who had gone on ahead with the horses, again met friendly Aborigines \\"who were overjoyed to see the party again\\" leading them to an excellent water hole. These were the Aboriginal people who Dr Beckler, Belooch and Peter had met during their first trip to Torowoto in search of trooper Lyons and McPherson.Cahir 2013 p.104 Dr Beckler recorded: > The natives, to whom we gave plenty of flour, sugar, tea and meat, made > their camp very close to ours and laughed and ate noisily through half the > night....The Wonamente natives had such trust in us that a lad who showed a > desire to come with us was allowed to do so.  Burke and Wills' final days  \\"Death of Burke\\", by Artur Loureiro, 1892 Site of Burke's death As the explorers wandered along the outlets of the Cooper Creek, Wills and King began to observe and even attempted to learn from the Yandruwandha. Wills began a list of words, King communicated over food- gathering and shelter. Even in Burke's final days however he remained suspicious and hostile to the Aboriginal people, attacking Aboriginal men carrying gifts of fish in nets.King's narrative in Burke and Wills 1861 Despite such provocations, the Yandruwandha continued to act in a measured way towards the Europeans.Allen 2013 p.254 The extreme conditions encountered by the explorers in the outback together with their failing health eventually resulted in the deaths of Burke and Wills. On 26 June 1861 Wills became severely ill; his rapidly declining condition caused Burke and King to travel up the Cooper Creek \\"to look for the blacks - it is the only chance we have of being saved from starvation\\". Burke and King searched for the Aboriginal people for two days before Burke became ill. Burke passed away on the Cooper Creek around 30 June 1861. At his request, he was left unburied by King who returned to Wills. King discovered Wills' body and once again set out in search of the local Aboriginal people. His life was now in their hands.Tolcher 1986 p.33-34Favenc 1983 p.217-218 King recorded that: > They appeared to feel great compassion for me when they understood that I > was alone on the creek, and gave me plenty to eat; after being four days > with them I saw that they were becoming tired of me, and they made signs > that they were going up the creek and that I had better go downwards, but I > pretended not to understand them. The same day they shifted camp, and I > followed them, and on reaching their camp I shot some crows, which pleased > them so much that they made me a breakwind in the centre of their camp, and > came and sat round me until such time as the crows were cooked, when they > assisted me to eat them.Victoria 1861-62, p.104 King lived at Cooper Creek under the care of the Yandruwandha for around three months until he was discovered by Edwin Welch, a member of Alfred Howitt's relief party on 15 September 1861. King was cared for by the Yandruwandha. He received daily rations of nardoo, and sometimes fish, and repaid their efforts by shooting birds for them. John King died at St Kilda on 15 January 1872. He never fully regained his health and died at the relatively young age of 33. = The Relief Expeditions = The disappearance of the explorers was beginning to cause considerable anxiety in Victoria. Wills' father and Burke's love interest, Julia Matthews, lobbied the Exploration Committee to organise a search and rescue mission.Murgatroyd 2002 p.276 Four relief parties were launched from across the country. These expeditions were successful in both determining the fate of the members of the Burke and Wills Expedition and unlocking vast areas of land for pastoralism. Their achievements would not have been possible without the assistance they received from Aboriginal people. The first relief party, the Victorian Relief Expedition, was formed in Melbourne by the Royal Society of Victoria and led by Alfred Howitt. The second, the South Australian Burke Relief Expedition, was formed in Adelaide and led by John McKinlay. The Exploration Committee of the Royal Society of Victoria appointed Frederick Walker to lead a third party of 12 men from Rockhampton along the Barcoo and Thomson rivers to the Norman River, then to the Gulf of Carpentaria to meet Commander Norman and H.C.MS steamship Victoria. The fourth relief party was led by William Landsborough. The Landsborough party travelled from Brisbane aboard the Firefly which took them to the Gulf of Carpentaria. These expeditions had a covert goal of scouting for grazing land and in the process of searching for the Burke and Wills Expedition, they explored thousands of kilometres of Queensland and South Australia. They unequivocally established the suitability of grazing in the Cooper basin and Western Queensland and caused a surge of pastoral expansion into these regions.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.33  The Victorian Relief Expedition (Howitt)  Alfred Howitt was a seasoned explorer who had previously travelled to the Cooper Creek area. Brahe accompanied Howitt's party and they reached the Cooper in less than four weeks. On the way the party set up camp at a place Howitt named Callyamurra, from the Aboriginal name Kaliumaru or \\"wide lake\\". Callyamurra was a splendid waterhole, teaming with birds and circled with rocks carved with sacred Aboriginal symbols. These showed that it was an important place of ceremony for the Yandruwandha and other tribes such as the Wangkamurra and Yawarrawarrka.Murgatroyd 2002 p.289 Howitt's prompt arrival at Cooper Creek was due in large part to the assistance he received from Aboriginal groups and guides, including two named Sandy and Frank who were recruited at Menindee. As the party made its way to Cooper Creek and beyond, Howitt noted they traversed the territories of three distinct language groups, each with its own system of managing and monitoring strangers.Allen 2013 p.248 > This was not a party of European men traversing the unknown - this was a > group of strangers being stewarded through a landscape, being shown where to > camp and how to sustain themselves.Howitt 1862 Their investigations of Fort Wills did not reveal any clues as to the fate of the missing men; they also failed to check the Dig Tree.Murgatroyd 2002 p.288-289 On 15 September 1861, a member of Howitt's party, a surveyor named Edwin Welch found King living with the Yandruwandha. > Looking at carelessly that the natives ahead, to whom we were gradually > approaching, I was startled at observing what appeared to be a white man > come from amongst them, although had it not been for the hat, it might still > have been mistaken for an aboriginal as many of them had obtained old > clothes at the depot. The hat convinced me it was a white man, and giving my > horse his head I dashed down and the bank towards him, where he fell on his > knees on the sand for a few moments in the attitude of prayer. On a rising I > hardly asked \\"who in the name of wonder are you?\\" And received the reply \\"I > am King, sir, the last man of the exploring expedition.\\"Welch 1861 Howitt's Aboriginal guides, Sandy and Frank, ran back to Howitt's camp with the amazing news. King was carried back to Callyamurra followed by some of his Aboriginal hosts who were \\"overjoyed he had been reunited with his companions and stood around the camp with a most gratified and delighted expression\\".Murgatroyd 2002 p.290 King led Howitt to Wills' grave site where they reburied his remains and made an inscription on a nearby tree. Burke was then buried. Once King was well enough to travel, Howitt decided to return southward but would not leave without registering his gratitude to the Aboriginal people Howitt's diary entry of 24 September 1861 notes: > Two days after we camped here the natives left and have not been seen since. > I could not think of leaving without showing them that we could appreciate > and reward the kindness they had shown to Burke's party and particularly to > King...They left, making signs expressive of friendship, carrying their > presents with them.Howitt 1857-73 On 1 March at Camp 32 (Cooper Creek) Howitt records: > Returned today, keeping much the same course, but nearer the creek over a > succession of very rotten flats, timbered with box. Had a vociferous leave > taking with our black friends, who have promised to wait four 'sleeps' until > I return. On 27 March at Camp 44: > Our guides from lake Hope remained at the native camp at Perodinna, and a > blackfellow who was out with McKinlay, named Boulin-ganne, accompanied us > this morning. He says that the water on McKinlay's route is now dry. Four > other natives accompanied our guide. At Camp 47 on 30 March Howitt again changes his Aboriginal guides as he moves across new Aboriginal country. > Left our guide Boulin-ganne with the Cudgee-gudgenee blacks... and took on a > native belonging to the lower end of Cooper's Creek\\". On 10 July \\"About > eleven o'clock came in sight of a good deal of stunted timber... and this > our kyejerou black, Tommy, pronounced to be the creek. Howitt's diary of 1 October: > halted above our 27th camp, at a number of water holes, where there was > pretty good feed. Passed our black friends on the road who invited us to > stop and eat fish and nardoo, and have a corroborree.... When we arrived... > only the lubras and piccaninnies were at home... They began to pack up their > things for a flight; but an amicable understanding being brought about, and > some of the men returning, we were soon the best of friends. I distributed > the few remaining presents, and they gave in return, some chewed pitchery > (pituri) and nardoo balls.Howitt 1861 On their return to Melbourne Howitt's party passed through Fort Wills. He finally discovered the cache of journals, documents and maps hidden near the Dig Tree.Murgatroyd 2002 p.293Favenc 1983 p.219 One of the breastplates Howitt's diaries warmly acknowledged the debts he and King owed to Aboriginal people. He requested that the Exploration Committee produce a series of breastplates. These were inscribed with gratitude \\"for the Humanity shewn to the Explorers Burke, Wills and King 1861\\".National Museum of Australia, n.d. The breastplates were presented to the Yandruwandha by Howitt on his next expedition to Cooper Creek when he was tasked with retrieving the bodies of Burke and Wills. Howitt's diaries were published in the colonial press over the next six months; settlers noted with surprise how easily Howitt moved through a landscape that had so challenged Burke and Wills. Howitt's party comfortably crossed racial and geographic frontiers and were able to locate both King and the bodies of Burke and Wills. Howitt's journals record numerous examples of his engagement with various Aboriginal communities, and acknowledgement of the value of Aboriginal knowledge.Boucher 2013 At times the Aboriginal conventions of stewardship assisted Howitt's party to find places to camp. On his second Expedition to retrieve the explorers' remains Howitt's party was guided to a \\"camp of natives... (who) were first much alarmed, but became friendly - pointing out a place for us to camp and sending down an wooden bowl of seed\\". In early October, Howitt's party encountered another group of Aboriginal people. The two groups soon came: > ...to a friendly understanding by means of a few words I knew... a jolly- > looking young fellow... took the lead... I was very much amused at the > ceremonious way in which my guide led the way, pointing out the best road > and very earnestly making me notice the bushes in my way. The tragedy of the Burke and Will Expedition fuelled a wave of pride and patriotism in Victoria. King returned to Melbourne a hero and was subjected to much unwanted fanfare. His emotional state precluded him from participating in many of the celebrations.Murgatroyd 2002 p.298 Burke was elevated to the status of a martyr though this may have been a diversionary tactic employed to avert attention from his and the Exploration Committee's obvious failings.Murgatroyd 2002 p.304-305 On retrieving the remains of Burke and Wills, Howitt transported them to Melbourne where they received Victoria's first state funeral and had a memorial erected in their honour.Favenc 1983 p.220Tolcher 1986 p.41 The public's fascination with the expedition was demonstrated when approximately 80% of Melbourne's population attended the state funeral to view the explorers' remains and to honour their deaths. A Royal Commission into the Expedition commenced towards the end of 1861. The commission apportioned a large amount of blame on Burke's leadership and the decisions he made. The Exploration Committee were also heavily criticised. Brahe and Wright were used as scapegoats and accused of a dereliction of duties.Murgatroyd 2002 p.307-321  The Landsborough Expedition  On 14 August 1861, the Firefly set sail from Brisbane and delivered William Landsborough and his party to the mouth of the Albert River in the Gulf of Carpentaria.Favenc 1983 p.229 They travelled southwards along the Gregory River and across the Barkly Plains and later to Menindee but failed to find a trace of the Burke and Wills party. The Landsborough Expedition party successfully travelled all the way from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Victoria. Jemmy, Fisherman and Jackey, the Aboriginal people involved with Landsborough's Expedition, not only guided the non-Aboriginal explorers through their country, they also fed and watered them. They were vital contributors to the experiences that became stories of colonial exploration and settlement.Jeffries 2013 Landsborough was heavily criticised for prioritising the discovery of grazing land over locating the Burke and Wills party.Feeken et al. 1970 p.173Murgatroyd 2002 p.282Clark & Cahir 2013 p.279-280  The South Australian Burke Relief Expedition  The South Australian Government directed John McKinlay and his party to travel to the Cooper and continue northwards in search of Burke and Wills. They travelled through Yauraworka (Yandruwandha Yawarrawarrka) territory across the Cooper flood plains and discovered a rudimentary grave at Lake Kadhi-baerri which was not in the customary style of an aboriginal burial site.Tolcher 1986 p.37 Careful excavation of the site and an artefact scatter led McKinlay to believe that this grave was associated with the Burke and Wills party. He named the site Lake Massacre and interviewed a local Aboriginal man who informed him that the man, who was thought to be Gray, had been killed with a semi-circular sword used by Aboriginal people.Tolcher 1986 p.38-39 McKinlay dispatched his second-in-command, W.L. Hodgkinson to the outposted settlement at Blanchewater to advise the authorities of his discoveries.Feeken et al. 1970 p.174 Upon his return, Hodgkinson informed McKinlay that Howitt had found King and the remains of Burke and Wills. McKinlay was satisfied that he had fulfilled his obligations and proceeded to embark on a search for grazing land.Tolcher 1986 p.39-40 McKinlay travelled north from the Innamincka region and discovered a number of lakes which he named Lake Hodgkinson, Lake Blanche and Lake Sir Richard, after the then South Australian Governor and his wife. From there McKinlay travelled to the Diamantina flood zone near Birdsville. McKinlay discovered large tracts of land that would support the grazing industry. His reports supported the conclusions made by Burke and Wills and Stuart; that travelling, grazing and droving in central Australia and across the continent were possible.Tolcher 1986 p.40-41Favenc 1983 p.227  The Victorian Relief Expedition (Walker)  Fredrick Walker was a bushman of considerable talent and had been credited for opening up substantial areas in central for Queensland for pastoralism.Murgatroyd 2002 p.281 Walker's relief expedition commenced from Rockhampton in September 1861. Walker discovered camel tracks near the Flinders River which he believed were made by the Burke and Wills party. He followed the tracks until they disappeared but failed to find any further traces of the missing party.Feeken et al. 1970 p.173 = Cooper Droving, Pastoralism and Pastoral Settlement = Burke and Wills and subsequent explorers opened up the central arid lands to European pastoralists and adventurers. The Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks, among other remote tracks, quickly became used as stock routes for overlanding sheep and cattle from the centre of Australia to southern markets. The tracks were utilised as primary transport corridors across the north-east of South Australia, to the east of Lake Eyre and connected the former railhead at Marree to the Channel Country of south-western Queensland. The discovery of high quality grazing land following the expeditions of Stuart, Burke and Wills and the rescue parties led to a surge in the pastoral settlement of the Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks region. The Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks became the principal droving routes into and through the region.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.31-33 In 1873 John Conrick and Robert Bostock, encouraged by the positive reports of explorers, became the first permanent settlers in the region. Bostock and Conrick took up properties near the waterholes of the Innamincka \\"choke\\", naming them Innamincka and Nappa Merrie respectively.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.35Tolcher 1986 p.51 They registered their leases at the Queensland Lands Office in Charleville. When government surveyors reached the region in 1879, Bostock discovered that Innamincka was actually located in South Australia and that he had been paying the wrong government for six years.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.35-35Tolcher 1986 p.52 Bostock abandoned Innamincka because the regulatory conditions imposed by South Australia were more onerous than in Queensland.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.36 Conrick built on the journeys of Gregory and Redford and with the assistance of local Aboriginal people was able to establish the Strzelecki Track as a recognised stock route.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.51 = Afghan Cameleers = Camels and their handlers transported supplies for Australian explorers, pastoralists and early settlers and consequently played an important role in the development of life along the Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks. The cameleers came from Afghanistan, Baluchistan and other regions of north-western India (now Pakistan). From the 1860s to the 1920s 20,000 camels and 2000 cameleers came to Australia.Pearson & Lennon 2010 p.60 Camels had many advantages over horses which were the traditional transportation choice for explorers and pastoralists. Camels were well suited to the Australian climate and were able to carry much heavier loads than horses. Camels required less water and could subsist on a wide variety of naturally occurring plants whereas horses required high-energy foods such as oats.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.55 The first camels to be imported in significant numbers to Australia were for the Burke and Wills Expedition.Pearson & Lennon 2010 p.59 The subsequent relief parties led by Howitt, McKinlay, Landsborough and Walker explored and mapped large parts of Australia with the help of camels. The camels' value quickly became apparent as they outperformed horses in the difficult desert conditions.Stevens 2002 p.34 From the 1920s motorised vehicles became increasingly popular in Australia. Trucks and cars began to usurp the transportation role of camels.Stevens 2002 p.267Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.57 Surveyors and police officers continued to use camels for some time but as their numbers began to grow they became considered by many as a feral pest. Some of the cameleers remained in Marree and performed a variety of jobs while others sought their fortunes in larger cities or returned home.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.57-58  Description  The Burke, Wills, King and Yandruwandha National Heritage Place is at an area of approximately 61ha, 240 km SE of Birdsville and 290 km SW of Windorah, comprising five circles each of 50 metre radius, and connected by a 10 metre wide corridor following the approximate location of the Cooper Creek watercourse. The five sites that constitute the Burke and Wills Expedition Sites are located in a corridor that stretches for approximately 70 kilometres and traces the banks of Cooper Creek through South Australia and Queensland. The five expedition sites and the corridor cover an area of 61 hectares. Four of the sites are in South Australia and are separated by a distance of approximately 30 kilometres: Will's Site, King's Site, Burke's Tree and Howitt's Site. These four sites are situated within the Innamincka/Cooper Creek State Heritage Area and the broader Innamincka Regional Reserve, which covers an area of 1.3 million hectares. The Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site is located in Queensland, and is approximately 40 kilometres from the nearest South Australian site, Howitt's Site. The Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site is located within land classified as a reserve for memorial purposes. The surrounding environment is arid semi-arid and contains a variety of landscape types from gibber plains to thriving wetlands fed by the waters of Cooper Creek system.Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources 2013 The gibber plains have sparse vegetation dominated by Mitchell- grass and other grasses and herbs. The wetlands are dominated by Northern River Red Gums and Coolabah species. = The Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site = The Dig Tree, 2014 The Face Tree, 2014 The Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site is approximately 60 x 70 meters in size. The site is 6 kilometres from Nappa Merrie homestead and 68 kilometres from Innamincka. The Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site is gazetted as a Memorial Reserve and is managed by the Royal Historical Society of Queensland. A small interpretation shed and toilet block are located at the entrance to the site. The site contains two marked trees, two stone cairns, interpretation signs and a modern hut and is sectioned off with white chain fencing.Historical Research Pty Ltd 2002 p.315, 318 The Dig Tree is a 200-250 year old spreading Coolabah (Eucalyptus microtheca). Three inscriptions are thought to have been inscribed on the tree. On the creek side of the trunk an inscription B LXV made by William Brahe denotes the 65th camp from Melbourne and the B is thought to refer to either \\"Burke\\" or \\"Brahe\\" On an upstream-side limb the words DEC 6.60 APR 21.61 were blazed on the tree to mark the date of the establishment and abandonment of the camp. On the northern side of the trunk an inscription notifying Burke, Wills and King of a buried cache of supplies has been subject to fierce debate and controversy over the years. Numerous variations about the exact wording of the inscription exist and include: DIG 9 FT W APR 21; AH DIG under.; DIG under 40FT W; DIG 3 ft NW; DIG 3 FT. N.W. APR. 21 1861; DIG UNDER 3 FT NW, DIG under.Phoenix & Corke 2012 p.4-5 It has also been suggested that the \\"dig\\" inscription was added in 1862 by Alexander Aitken, a member of Alfred Howitt's expedition party that was travelling to Cooper Creek to retrieve the bodies of Burke and Wills. Another account of the \\"dig\\" inscription suggests that the blaze was made on an entirely different tree, to the south of the \\"dig\\" tree. The possibility that the \\"dig\\" inscription was blazed on a separate tree is supported by evidence given by William Brahe and John King at a Commission of Enquiry into the expedition.Phoenix & Corke 2012 p.7-10 The inscriptions have been obscured over time by regrowth. The Face Tree (Eucalyptus microtheca) is located approximately 25 metres east of the Dig Tree. It portrays a rendition of the face of Robert O'Hara Burke and the letters ROB.Department of the Environment n.d. c A boardwalk has been constructed around the Dig Tree and Face Tree to prevent the trees being disturbed by visitors.Department of Environment and Heritage Protection 2013 Fort Wills is located on the northern bank of the Bulloo waterhole. The Dig Tree and the Face Tree are encompassed within the larger Fort Wills Site. = Howitt's Site = The true location of Howitt's Site, the place from where Howitt subsequently discovered John King, is subject to debate. A body of evidence suggests that the site marked with a cairn is actually the location of one of Howitt's campsites during his 1862 expedition to retrieve the bodies of Burke and Wills. This information was confirmed by personal communication with a member of the Burke and Wills Historical Society.D Phoenix pers. comm. 03 November 2014 The description below provides details on the site that is often referred to in popular literature. Howitt's camp site is located on the eastern bank of the Callyamurra waterhole and is approximately 40 kilometres from the Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site. The site has been marked with a cairn. = Burke's Tree = The Burke's Tree site is approximately 4 x 7 metres in size and is located 9 kilometres northeast of Innamincka and 10 kilometres from Howitt's Site. The site is accessed by a nature trail that extends for 300 metres from a car park and has a number of interpretative signs at various points. The site is 100 metres from the creek bed and contains a Coolabah tree (Eucalyptus microtheca) that marks the original gravesite of Robert O'Hara Burke and a memorial plinth that reads Robert O'Hara Burke died here 28 June 1861. The tree and plinth are surrounded by a low metal chain fence. John McKinlay visited the grave site on 7 December 1861 and blazed his conjoined initials MK into the trunk and the word DIG to indicate a buried bottle containing a note he had written. Burke's Tree is subject to deposition from flooding and the ground level has gradually risen after each flood event and the inscriptions are no longer visible.State Library of Victoria n.d. = King's Site = King's Site is approximately 8 kilometres west of Innamincka and 10 kilometres from Burke's Tree. The site is accessed via a nature trail that extends 150 metres from a car park and is 165 metres from the creek bed. The site contains a stone plinth between two trees; a blazed tree is located behind the plinth. The stone plinth was erected in 1973 and reads John King Born County Tyrone N.Ireland 5-12-1838 Died Melbourne 1872 of the Burke and Wills Exploring Expedition was rescued 15-9-1861 in nearby creek by EJ Welch of the relief party of AW Howitt who established camp 32 in this vicinity. Erected 1-9-1973 by the Mack and Lofler Families Walkerie SA. In 1948 a nearby tree was blazed with the word KING. The tree has been reduced to a height of approximately 1.5 metres and has a concrete footing with a metal rod running through its hollow centre.Geo Dynamics n.d. = Wills' Site = The true location of Wills' Site, the place where William John Wills passed away, is subject to debate. A body of evidence exists that suggests that Wills' original resting place is actually located two kilometres downstream from the place that is currently recognised as the place where he passed away, confirmed by personal communication with a member of the Burke and Wills Historical Society.D Phoenix pers. comm 03 November 2014 The description below provides details on the site that is often referred to in popular literature. Wills' Site is located 20 kilometres west of Innamincka and 10 kilometres from King's Site. The site is where Howitt's relief party found and buried the body of William John Wills. The site is approximately 5 x 5 metres in size and contains a stone plinth surrounded by three mature trees and an interpretative sign. Howitt blazed an inscription on a nearby tree that read W J WILLS XLV YDS NNW AH. In 1947 or 1948 a Queensland grazier named Alfred Cory Towner blazed another tree with the inscription WILLS 1861 and erected a pipe nearby with the words WILLS DIED IN CREEK 1861. In 1996 sand and stones were placed around the pipe to protect it from damage. A cairn was erected at the site in 1973.Burke & Wills Web n.d  Condition  The five sites that constitute the Burke and Wills Expedition Sites were the scene for some of the most dramatic events associated with the exploration of Australia. These events occurred more than 150 years ago and much of the physical fabric from the sites has disappeared through natural events such as flooding as well as vandalism and souveniring. The five individual sites within the place are all professionally managed as historic sites and are afforded protection under various pieces of state legislation. = The Dig Tree and Fort Wills = The Dig Tree has been treated for pests and diseases by a professional tree surgeon from the Queensland Department of Primary Industry and is in good condition. Cement has been inserted on one side of the base of the tree for stabilisation purposes. The inscriptions have been obscured over time by regrowth and the only clearly remaining blaze is LXV. The broader site is in good condition. Boardwalks have been placed around the two trees to minimise soil compaction and the potential impacts of tourists. = Howitt's Site = The site is generally in good condition. = Burke's Tree = The site is in good condition. The tree appears generally healthy; one of the large tree branches is resting on the metal chain fence that surrounds the site and may break off in the future. The stone plinth has been scratched with graffiti. At least five pieces of Burke's Tree have been removed over the years; two of these pieces are currently in the possession of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (SA Branch). = King's Site = The site is generally in good condition. The King blaze in the tree is clearly visible however a large crack has obscured the in the inscription. = Wills' Site = Wills' site is generally in good condition. The plinth has some water damage and a branch of one of the surrounding trees is overhanging the plinth.  Heritage listing  The five Burke and Wills Expedition Sites (the Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site, Burke's Tree, Wills' Site, King's Site and Howitt's Site) have outstanding heritage value to the nation as the setting for the key events associated with the Burke and Wills Expedition, which was a defining moment in Australia's cultural history. The expedition of 1860 - 1861 was the first to cross the continent from south to north, which, along with the subsequent relief parties facilitated further exploration of an enormous area of the outback. The Burke and Wills Expedition and those of the subsequent relief parties contributed to the development of Australia's grazing industry and informed the process of pastoral settlement across the country. The expedition played a significant role in the redefinition of Australia's geopolitical landscape and identification of areas habitable by Europeans in the outback. The Burke and Wills Expedition provides an outstanding example of the processes associated with early European exploration of Australia. The aims of the expedition cover the breadth of factors that motivated exploration in the 19th century and demonstrate a common theme in the field of exploration whereby individual expeditions, often composed of many men, are remembered and named exclusively after the leaders that commanded them. The Burke and Wills Expedition provides important insights into the 19th century European attitude towards the Australian environment and its Indigenous peoples. The expedition is a rare example of a large-scale expedition that relied substantially on public subscriptions for funding. The expedition resulted in the loss of seven lives including those of Burke and Wills. The story of the expedition has captured the imagination of successive generations of Australians over the past 150 years and has been transformed into a \\"national myth of heroic endeavour\\" that has played a formative role in the development of Australia's national character.Bonyhady 2002 p.iii The Burke and Wills Expedition Sites, which lie on Yandruwandha-Yawarrawarrka country and Wongkumara country, connect contemporary Australians with the expedition's key figures: Robert Burke, William Wills, John King, Alfred Howitt and the assistance provided to them by the Yandruwandha Aboriginal people. Burke and Wills were the leaders of the expedition; it was their leadership and the decisions they made that had a major impact on the expedition, its aftermath and the transformation of the story into an iconic moment in Australia's cultural history. John King was the sole survivor of the party of four that made the historic journey to the Gulf of Carpentaria. He is remembered for his survival through connection with the Yandruwandha people who cared for him until he was rescued by Alfred Howitt. Alfred Howitt played a pivotal role in the story of the Burke and Wills Expedition through his rescue of John King. Howitt recorded the name of the Yandruwandha people who, in King's words, had treated him as one of their own over the months following the deaths of Burke and Wills. The Burke, Wills, King and Yandruwandha National Heritage Place was listed on the Australian National Heritage List on 22 January 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Events, Processes The five individual locations that constitute the Burke and Wills Expedition Sites (the Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site, Howitt's Site, Burke's Tree, King's Site and Wills' Site) have outstanding heritage value to the nation as the major setting of the Burke and Wills Expedition. The Burke and Wills Expedition was a watershed event that led to the extensive exploration of the Australian outback and the spread of pastoral settlement across the country. Significant areas of grazing land were opened up as a result of the Burke and Wills Expedition and those of the subsequent relief parties. The expeditions by Burke and Wills, their rival John McDouall Stuart, and the relief-parties including Alfred Howitt, John McKinlay, William Landsborough and Frederick Walker, altered Australia's geopolitical landscape through the annexation of the area known today as the Northern Territory by South Australia and the extension of Queensland's territorial boundary westward from 141¬∫ to 138 ¬∫ longitude. The Burke and Wills Expedition traversed the length of the country; however the events that unfolded, primarily in Yandruwandha Aboriginal country, are significant in the context of the dominant 19th century European attitudes towards Aboriginal people. Whereas Burke had been suspicious of the Yandruwandha's interest in the party and kept them at a safe distance, he, Wills and King became increasingly dependent on contact with the Yandruwandha as their situation worsened. After Burke and Wills died, John King followed the movements of Yandruwandha and lived with them until he was found by Howitt. The Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site was the location of the tragedy that characterises much of the expedition. The return of Burke, Wills and King to the site marks a significant achievement in the European exploration of the continent but is remembered in popular consciousness for their arrival only hours after their comrades who had just departed after waiting for four months. The site contains the DIG inscription that marked the hidden cache of supplies that helped sustain Burke, Wills and King upon their return from the Gulf of Carpentaria. Brahe and Wright failed to realise that the explorers had successfully returned from northern Australia, which was in part attributable to the oversight made by Burke and Wills to not leave a clear message advising of their return to the site. The Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site demarcates a boundary in the outback where Europeans, with their limited knowledge of the Australian environment, could survive. The Burke's Tree site and the Wills' Site where Burke and Wills respectively died symbolise the harsh and dangerous nature of the outback encountered by 19th century Europeans and are reminders of the key roles of Burke and Wills as leaders of the expedition. Howitt's Site signifies the attempts made by the rescue parties to find the missing explorers and is closely associated with the place of John King's rescue. The success of Howitt in locating the lone survivor of the small party that travelled to the north coast of Australia demonstrates not only the accomplishments of the relief parties in determining the fate of the Burke and Wills explorers, but their wider achievements in identifying and opening up vast areas of grazing land in South Australia and Queensland. The success of the relief parties must also be viewed in light of the information, guidance and support offered to them by Aboriginal peoples such as the Yandruwandha. King's Site is important as the place where King was found alive by Alfred Howitt's relief party. King owed his survival to the hospitality of the Yandruwandha people; without their assistance, it is almost certain that he would have suffered the same fate as Burke and Wills. King's Site is an outstanding memorial to the Yandruwandha people's role in the story that was of great significance in colonial times and continues to have iconic importance in Australia's history. . Criterion H: Significant people The Burke and Wills Expedition Sites have outstanding heritage value to the nation because of their special association with Robert Burke, William Wills, John King, Alfred Howitt and the Yandruwandha people who assisted the expedition. The Burke and Wills Expedition is one of the most well-known events in Australia's cultural history. Although more than 150 years have transpired since the expedition Australians continue to be fascinated by the drama and tragedy that define the Burke and Wills story. Burke and Wills are at the heart of the story and it was their leadership and decisions that had a major impact on the expedition and its aftermath. Their failure to leave a clear message at the Dig Tree and Fort Wills Site that signalled their successful return from the Gulf of Carpentaria was the catalyst for many of the subsequent events. Burke and Wills exemplify that element of Australia's national character that embraces tragedy and celebrates failure. Their expedition has become a national myth of struggle and survival. John King was the sole survivor of the small party of four that made the historic journey to the north coast of Australia. The story of King's survival is a testimony to the Yandruwandha people's adaptation to their country, which proved fatally harsh to the explorers. King's survival also highlights the importance of the relief parties within the story and added an extra dimension to the Burke and Wills story that fuelled public interest in the expedition and enabled the Exploration Committee to brand the expedition as a successful venture. Alfred Howitt was one of Australia's foremost explorers, scientists and anthropologists. His role is integral to the Burke and Wills story as the person who rescued John King, returned the bodies of Burke and Wills to Melbourne and as a representative of all the relief parties that made significant geographic discoveries. The Yandruwandha people who assisted the expedition were an essential part of the story of the Burke and Wills expedition on Cooper Creek. While cautious and sometimes suspicious about the interest the Yandruwandha took in them, the explorers described how the Yandruwandha were mostly hospitable, and offered them fish and nardoo while receiving small items in exchange. After Burke and Wills died the Yandruwandha accommodated King, signalled his presence to the relief party and located the bodies of Burke and Wills, enabling them to be retrieved. Their role in the story was significant at the time and continues to be an important part of Australia's cultural history.
