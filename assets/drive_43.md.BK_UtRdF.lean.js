CATIE is the first graduate school in Agricultural Sciences in Latin America. History CATIE's origin dates back to October 7, 1942 when the Inter- American Institute for Agricultural Sciences (IICA) was founded. From its inception, the Institute's mandate has centered on research and education in agriculture and natural resources in the American tropics. The Graduate School began its operations in 1946. In 1960, IICA's General Directorate was moved from Turrialba to San Jos√©, Costa Rica; research and teaching activities continued in Turrialba. Agriculture, from the beginning, implied a broad spectrum of activities and disciplines including crop production, livestock management, renewable natural resources and the social and economic dimensions of these fields of endeavor. Eventually, the Turrialba base of the Institute was transformed into a Center for Education and Research (CEI). Over a nine- year period, beginning in 1960, significant changes led to a strengthening of training opportunities for Latin American professionals, thereby laying the 6 groundwork for agricultural development in the region. In 1970, the Center for Education and Research was named the Tropical Center for Education and Research (CTEI). The year 1973 was an important one for this institution. The Centro Agron√≥mico Tropical de Investigaci√≥n y Ense√±anza (CATIE) was definitively established as an autonomous entity dedicated to research, higher education and outreach activities. Eighteen years later, in 1991, the governing body of CATIE was constituted to create a wholly independent Board of Directors made up of well-renowned individuals from throughout the world who represent ‚Äúno one but themselves‚Äù, thereby providing autonomy and stability to the institution. Additionally, the Superior Council, composed of Ministers from the Ministries of Agriculture or Environment of CATIE's member countries, oversees the institution and ensures that the interests of their countries are represented in CATIE's plans and activities. Today, CATIE is an international, non-profit institution dedicated to research, higher education and outreach in agricultural sciences, natural resources and related topics in the American tropics. CATIE's Mission is to ‚ÄúIncrease sustainable and inclusive human well-being in Latin America and the Caribbean, promoting education, research and innovation for development, sustainable management of agriculture and conservation of natural resources.‚Äù The graduate program at CATIE has a long and proud history. The M.Sc. program dates back to 1946 and has produced over 2000 graduates, the majority of whom have served the region and their professions in leadership positions. Three professional master's degrees have been successfully introduced at CATIE since 2007. In 1996, after a careful study, a doctoral program was initiated in partnership with leading institutions in the United States and Europe. In 2013, the program was expanded to include an option in Spanish with leading cooperating institutions in Latin America and Spain.

He is an ensemble member playwright at Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago and an assistant professor of Theater and Performance Studies at Brown University.  Early life and education  Gardley was born and raised in Oakland, California. The son of a nurse and a minister, he describes growing up in a home surrounded by books, ultimately leading him toward his academic path, at first wanting to become an anesthesiologist. Gardley originally studied and wrote poetry at San Francisco State University (SFSU), though his poetry professors told him that his poems read like plays. Initially not wanting to admit this, Gardley eventually came around to acknowledge that his poems often did incorporate elements of playwrighting. Regarding this time, Gardley later recalled, \\"Oh, this is where I belong. I don't like speaking my work, I like hearing my work. What I like about theater is it's like an orchestra. There are these different sounds from different people. I think of my plays as compositions in a way.\\" Gardley earned the SFSU African American Student of Outstanding Achievement Award for 2000‚Äì1 and graduated with his B.F.A. Gardley went on to earn his M.F.A. in playwriting from Yale School of Drama in 2004. Upon graduation, Gardley started teaching creative writing at Columbia University.  Career  Gardley is among a new group of young African-American playwrights who have come to prominence during the \\"Age of Obama\\". These emerging playwrights are considered to be postblack artists. He has cited the Harlem art scene as influential to his work, with James Baldwin as a primary inspiration. The New Yorker described Gardley in 2010 as \\"an interesting heir to Garcia Lorca, Pirandello and Tennessee Williams\\", and a \\"potentially great writer who has yet to write a great play\\". Gardley's play ...And Jesus Moonwalks the Mississippi was produced at the Cutting Ball Theater and has earned both positive reviews and two sold-out extensions. ...And Jesus Moonwalks the Mississippi is a poetic voyage of forgiveness and redemption highly influenced by the myth of Demeter and Persephone. The play encompasses traditional storytelling, gospel music, and a humor to create a rich and vividly imaginative world. According to Gardley, \\"Jesus Moonwalks is in a lot of ways my signature play. It is based upon a story my great-grandmother used to tell about her father who fled the bonds of slavery and traveled the country in search of his family.\\" In 2010, it was rated as one of the top ten plays in the Bay Area. His play The House That Will Not Stand, inspired by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's The House of Bernarda Alba, had its world premiere with the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in January 2014. The play centers around a black Creole woman who, recently widowed, must contend with the impending loss of her home and the privilege of being married to a rich white man in 1830s New Orleans; the work utilizes dark humor and stylized melodrama to tell the story of female sexuality and race relations. It was subsequently staged in London at the Tricycle Theatre, with an Off- Broadway premiere at New York Theatre Workshop in July 2018.\\"The House That Will Not Stand, Tricycle - theatre review\\", London Evening Standard, 20 October 2014. In 2013 Gardley began a three-year term as the Playwright in Residence at Victory Gardens Theater, through the National Playwright Residency Program, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and administered by HowlRound. It was renewed in 2016 for another three years. In 2017, his play black odyssey, commissioned by the Denver Center Theater Company where it premiered in 2014, was revised for production at California Shakespeare Theater. This second production reset the play in Oakland and included a new score by Linda Tillery and Molly Holm. It garnered 11 nominations and seven Theatre Bay Area Awards, including: Outstanding Production, Outstanding Ensemble, Outstanding Male Actor (Aldo Billingslea), Outstanding Female Actor (Margo Hall), Outstanding Direction (Eric Ting), Outstanding Costume Design (Dede Ayite), and the Creative Specialties award to Marcus Gardley for his adaptation of Homer‚Äôs Odyssey. In 2013, Gardley contributed a short play The New Black Fest as part of a collaborative project titled Facing Our Truth: 10-Minute Plays on Trayvon, Race and Privilege, premiering in New York City. Gardley's piece, titled No More Monsters Here, features a black psychiatrist who prescribes that a white woman live as a black man for three days as a cure for her \\"negroidphobia.\\" In addition to his work as a playwright, Gardley has written for several television series. He served as a staff writer on the Amazon Prime series Z: The Beginning of Everything, and later as an executive story editor for The Chi, which premiered on Showtime in 2018.  Awards  He was the recipient of the Helen Merrill Award in 2008 and the Kesselring honor award. His plays This World in a Woman's Hands (2009) and Love is a Dream House in Lorin (2007) have been named as the best plays in Bay Area theater, with Love is a Dream House in Lorin being nominated for the National Critics Steinberg New Play Award. Gardley is the author of the box: play about the prison industrial complex which premiered in Brooklyn in 2014 by The Foundry; black odyssey, which premiered at The Denver Theater Center the same year; The Road Weeps, the Well Runs Dry, which had a national tour in 2013; and Dance of the Holy Ghosts, which premiered at the Yale Repertory Theatre in 2004. He is the recent recipient of the 2014 Glickman Award for his play The House That Will Not Stand, which was commissioned and produced by Berkeley Rep. It had subsequent productions at Yale Rep and the Tricycle Theater in London and was a finalist for the 2015 Kennedy Prize. Gardley was the 2013 USA James Baldwin Fellow and the 2011 PEN Laura Pels award winner for Mid-Career Playwright. Gardley has won the San Francisco Bay Area's Gerbode Emerging Playwright Award, the National Alliance for Musical Theatre Award, the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Scholarship, and the ASCAP Cole Porter Prize. Gardley has an M.F.A. from the Yale Drama School. He is a member of New Dramatists, The Dramatists Guild and the Lark Play Development Center. Gardley was selected as one of 50 talented playwrights for audiences to follow by the Dramatists Magazine.

Much of the album is atmospheric in tone, with sound effects echoing the inner city environment, but Giarrusso said his decision to limit the number of songs on the album was a deliberate one. \\"I was adamant with the soundtrack that we didn't want a party tape, the back catalogue of a record company,\\" he told The Australian.

The consulting producer for the film was the famous American director Bobby Roth. It stars Seda Eƒüridere and Tamer Karadaƒülƒ±.  Plot  Alina tells story of Melisa Eryƒ±lmaz, a double agent named Alina, and her fight to discover the truth about her family and her real identity. Alina was adopted by the Turkish secret service agent Fƒ±rat Yƒ±lmaz at the age of 3 and was raised under the name Melisa Eryilmaz. Melisa learned Russian, Bulgarian, German, Arabic and English as a result of the trips she took as a kid with Firat Yilmaz and eventually started to work with intelligence agencies such as MI-6, CSR, CESIS, BND, SGDN and SAVAK. What she would discover on one assignment would shatter everything she knows about her life and would set her on a dangerous mission to discover the truth behind her real identity.  Cast  Tamer Karadaƒülƒ± * Seda Eƒüridere  Production  Production began early 2010 and after a long search, Seda Eƒüridere was cast as the title character Alina in the feature film. Consulting director/producer for the film was the acclaimed American director Bobby Roth. Upon being cast as the titular character, Eƒüridere persuaded director Bobby Roth to shoot parts of the film in her home country. In an interview with one of the top newspapers in Turkey, Hurriyet, Bobby Roth praised Eƒüridere's acting performance and work discipline and noted that \\"I accepted the project and agreed to shoot in Turkey only because I trusted Seda.\\" The casting process for the male lead actor was diligent and producers had difficulty finding a Turkish actor who spoke good English but finally, in 2012, Tamer Karadaƒülƒ± was cast from a large pool of acclaimed Turkish celebrities to play the male lead opposite Eƒüridere. For the movie, Egridere was required to speak Russian, Spanish and Arabic, undergo extensive martial arts training and learn to ride a motorcycle to play the title role of Alina. She was celebrated for her physical performance and the sex scenes with Tamer Karadaƒülƒ± generated a lot of buzz around the film.

Very few Greeks became farmers in the United States, even though many had backgrounds in agriculture. The first Greek settlement in Detroit was between St. Antoine and Beaubien on Monroe Street. The Greeks later moved to Macomb Street.Woodford, p. 189. In the beginning of the year 1900 the city's first Greek coffeeshop opened on 40 Macomb Street.Frangos, page unstated PT31 of Google Books. There were 250 Greeks in Detroit in 1909. In 1912 persecution of Greeks began, prompting immigration from Greece. The period 1911 to 1917 was the peak immigration period from Greece. In 1914 there were up to 8,000 Greeks in the city. In 1914 a wave of immigration from Greece came because Henry Ford offered his $5 per day jobs. The Greek population rose to 10,000 to 15,000 by 1930. Peloponnesus was the source of most Greek immigration to Detroit. Frangos wrote that \\"While no other reliable statistics are available, certainly Greeks from the three islands of Chios, Crete, and Cyprus have always made up a sizeable element of the community.\\" The National Centre of Social Research in Athens, by 1972, estimated that the State of Michigan had ethnic 100,000 Greeks.

In addition, cholera emerged as an epidemic threat and spread worldwide in six pandemics in the nineteenth century. The third plague pandemic emerged in China in the mid-nineteenth century and spread worldwide in the 1890s.  Medical responses  Epidemics of the 19th century were faced with the medical advances that made 20th- century epidemics much rarer and less lethal. Micro-organisms (viruses and bacteria) had been discovered in the 18th century, but it was not until the late 19th century that the experiments of Lazzaro Spallanzani and Louis Pasteur disproved spontaneous generation conclusively, allowing germ theory and Robert Koch's discovery of micro-organisms as the cause of disease transmission. Thus throughout the majority of the 19th century, there was only the most basic, common-sense understanding of the causes, amelioration, and treatment of epidemic disease. The 19th century actually marked a transformation period in medicine. This included the first uses of chloroform and nitrous dioxides as anesthesia, important discoveries in regards of pathology and the perfection of the autopsy, and advances in our understanding of the human body. Medical institutions were also transitioning to new hospital styles to try to prevent the spread of disease and stop over crowding with the mixing of the poor and the sick as seen prior to the 1800s. The late 19th century was the beginning of widespread use of vaccines.Baxby, Derrick (1999). \\"Edward Jenner's Inquiry; a bicentenary analysis\\".

Sulfonamides did not appear until 1935, and penicillin, discovered in 1928, was not available as a treatment until 1950. New York City Board of Health, 1832‚Äîthe outdated public health advice demonstrates the lack of understanding of the disease and its actual causative factors During the second cholera pandemic of 1816‚Äì1837, the scientific community varied in its beliefs about its causes. In France, doctors believed cholera was associated with the poverty of certain communities or poor environment. Russians believed the disease was contagious and quarantined their citizens. The United States believed that cholera was brought by recent immigrants, specifically the Irish. Lastly, some British thought the disease might arise from divine intervention. During the third pandemic, Tunisia, which had not been affected by the two previous pandemics, thought Europeans had brought the disease. They blamed their sanitation practices. The prevalence of the disease in the South in areas of black populations convinced United States scientists that cholera was associated with African Americans. Current researchers note they lived near the waterways by which travelers and ships carried the disease and their populations were underserved with sanitation infrastructure and health care. The Soho outbreak in London in 1854 ended after the physician John Snow identified a neighborhood Broad Street pump as contaminated and convinced officials to remove its handle. Snow believed that germ-contaminated water was the source of cholera, rather than particles in the air (referred to as \\"miasmata\\"). His study proved contaminated water was the main agent spreading cholera, although he did not identify the contaminant. Though Filippo Pacini had isolated Vibrio cholerae as the causative agent for cholera that year, it would be many years before miasma theory would fall out of favor. Disinfection team in the 1892 cholera outbreak in Hamburg In London, in June 1866Johnson, S: The Ghost Map(), a localized epidemic in the East End claimed 5,596 lives, just as the city was completing construction of its major sewage and water treatment systems. William Farr, using the work of John Snow, et al., as to contaminated drinking water being the likely source of the disease, relatively quickly identified the East London Water Company as the source of the contaminated water. Quick action prevented further deaths. During the fifth cholera pandemic, Robert Koch isolated Vibrio cholerae and proposed postulates to explain how bacteria caused disease. His work helped to establish the germ theory of disease. Prior to this time, many physicians believed that microorganisms were spontaneously generated, and disease was caused by direct exposure to filth and decay. Koch helped establish that the disease was more specifically contagious and was transmittable through the contaminated water supply. The fifth was the last serious European cholera outbreak, as cities improved their sanitation and water systems. Cholera Cholera bacteria Cholera is an infection of the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Cholera is transmitted primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the cholera bacterium. The bacteria multiply in the small intestine; the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms, can pass on the disease if it contacts the water supply by any means. History does not recount any incidents of cholera until the 19th century. Cholera came in seven waves, the last two of which occurred in the 20th century. The first cholera pandemic started in 1816, spread across India by 1820, and extended to Southeast Asia and Central Europe, lasting until 1826. A second cholera pandemic began in 1829, reached Russia, causing the Cholera Riots. It spread to Hungary, Germany and Egypt in 1831,Cholera Epidemic in Egypt (1947) . and London, Paris, Quebec, Ontario and New York City the following year.Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1826-37 Cholera reached the Pacific coast of North America by 1834, reaching into the center of the country by steamboat and other river traffic. The third cholera pandemic began in 1846 and lasted until 1860. It hit Russia hardest, with over one million deaths. In 1846, cholera struck Mecca, killing over 15,000.Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1846-63. UCLA School of Public Health.

In 1849, outbreak occurred again in Paris, and in London, killing 14,137, over twice as many as the 1832 outbreak. Cholera hit Ireland in 1849 and killed many of the Irish Famine survivors, already weakened by starvation and fever. In 1849, cholera claimed 5,308 lives in the major port city of Liverpool, England, an embarkation point for immigrants to North America, and 1,834 in Hull, England. Cholera spread throughout the Mississippi river system. Thousands died in New York City, a major destination for Irish immigrants. Cholera claimed 200,000 victims in Mexico. That year, cholera was transmitted along the California, Mormon and Oregon Trails, killing people that are believed to have died on their way to the California Gold Rush, Utah and Oregon in the cholera years of 1849‚Äì1855.Vibrio cholerae in recreational beach waters and tributaries of Southern California.

The Philippines were infected in 1858 and Korea in 1859. In 1859, an outbreak in Bengal contributed to transmission of the disease by travelers and troops to Iran, Iraq, Arabia and Russia. Japan suffered at least seven major outbreaks of cholera between 1858 and 1902.

Outbreaks in North America in 1866‚Äì1873 killed some 50,000 Americans. In 1866, localized epidemics occurred in the East End of London, in southern Wales, and Amsterdam. In the 1870s, cholera spread in the U.S. as an epidemic from New Orleans along the Mississippi River and to ports on its tributaries. In the fifth cholera pandemic (1881‚Äì1896), according to Dr A. J. Wall, the 1883‚Äì1887 part of the epidemic cost 250,000 lives in Europe and at least 50,000 in the Americas. Cholera claimed 267,890 lives in Russia (1892); 120,000 in Spain; 90,000 in Japan and over 60,000 in Persia. In Egypt, cholera claimed more than 58,000 lives. The 1892 outbreak in Hamburg killed 8,600 people. Smallpox Smallpox is caused by either of the two viruses, Variola major and Variola minor. Smallpox vaccine was available in Europe, the United States, and the Spanish Colonies during the last part of the century. The Latin names of this disease are Variola Vera. The words come from varius (spotted) or varus (pimple). In England this disease was first known as the \\"pox\\" or the \\"red plague\\". Smallpox settles itself in small blood vessels of the skin and in the mouth and throat. The symptoms of smallpox are rash on the skin and blisters filled with raised liquid. The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually during the 19th century and one third of all the blindness of that time was caused by smallpox. 20 to 60% of all the people that were infected died and 80% of all the children with the infection also died. It caused also many deaths in the 20th century, over 300‚Äì500 million. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also had Smallpox when he was only 11 years old. He survived the smallpox outbreak in Austria. Typhus Epidemic typhus is caused by the bacteria Rickettsia Prowazekii; it comes from lice. Murine Typhus is caused by the Rickettsia Typhi bacteria, from the fleas on rats. Scrub Typhus is caused by the Orientia Tsutsugamushi bacteria, from the harvest mites on humans and rodents. Queensland tick typhus is caused by the Rickettsia Australis bacteria, from ticks. During Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in 1812, more French soldiers died of typhus than were killed by the Russians.The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus . Joseph M. Conlon. A major epidemic occurred in Ireland between 1816 and 1819, during the Year Without a Summer; an estimated 100,000 Irish perished. Typhus appeared again in the late 1830s, and between 1846 and 1849 during the Great Irish Famine. Spreading to England, and called \\"Irish fever\\", it was noted for its virulence. It killed people of all social classes, as lice were endemic and inescapable, but it hit particularly hard in the lower or \\"unwashed\\" social strata. In Canada alone, the typhus epidemic of 1847 killed more than 20,000 people from 1847 to 1848, mainly Irish immigrants in fever sheds and other forms of quarantine, who had contracted the disease aboard coffin ships. In the United States, epidemics occurred in Baltimore, Memphis and Washington DC between 1865 and 1873, and during the US Civil War. Yellow fever Yellow fever virus This disease is transmitted by the bite of female mosquito; the higher prevalence of transmission by Aedes aegypti has led to it being known as the Yellow Fever Mosquito. The transmission of yellow fever is entirely a matter of available habitat for vector mosquito and prevention such as mosquito netting. They mostly infect other primates, but humans can be infected. The symptoms of the fever are: Headaches, back and muscle pain, chills and vomiting, bleeding in the eyes and mouth, and vomit containing blood. Yellow fever accounted for the largest number of the 19th-century's individual epidemic outbreaks, and most of the recorded serious outbreaks of yellow fever occurred in the 19th century. It is most prevalent in tropical-like climates, but the United States was not exempted from the fever. New Orleans was plagued with major epidemics during the 19th century, most notably in 1833 and 1853. At least 25 major outbreaks took place in the Americas during the 18th and 19th centuries, including particularly serious ones in Santo Domingo in 1803Marr, J. S., & Cathey, J. T. (n.d.).

Bloom, The Mississippi Valley's Great Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878, Louisiana State U. Press, 1993 Major outbreaks occurred repeatedly in Gibraltar; outbreaks in 1804, 1814, and again in 1828. Barcelona suffered the loss of several thousand citizens during an outbreak in 1821. Urban epidemics continued in the United States until 1905, with the last outbreak affecting New Orleans. Plague The third plague pandemic was a major bubonic plague pandemic that began in Yunnan, China in 1855. This episode of bubonic plague spread to all inhabited continents in the 1890s and first years of the 1900s, and ultimately led to more than 12 million deaths in India and China, with about 10 million killed in India alone.Infectious Diseases: Plague Through History, sciencemag.org A natural reservoir of plague is located in western Yunnan and is an ongoing health risk today. The third pandemic of plague originated in this area after a rapid influx of Han Chinese to exploit the demand for minerals, primarily copper, in the latter half of the nineteenth century. By 1850, the population had exploded to over 7 million people. Increasing transportation throughout the region brought people in contact with plague-infected fleas, the primary vector between the yellow-breasted rat (Rattus flavipectus) and humans. The spread of European empires and the development of new forms of transport such as the steam engine made it easier for both humans and rats to spread the disease along existing trade routes.  Scarlet Fever  In the mid-nineteenth century the mortality caused by Scarlet Fever rose in England and Wales.

Somerville was educated first at a boys preparatory school in North Wales, then Queen's College, London, and later at Guy's Hospital Medical School. Initially drawn to surgery, she chose to pursue a career in cardiology at the National Heart Hospital, Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street and later at the Brompton Hospital. Her work led to the opening of the world's first dedicated ward for children and adolescents with congenital heart disease, the first World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology in London, and a GUCH charity which was later renamed \\"The Somerville Foundation\\" in her honour. The medical professionals who she trained and who have come to celebrate and follow her are known as \\"Unicorns\\". Early life and education Jane Somerville was born in Edwardes Square, Kensington, London, on 24 January 1933 to Joseph Bertram Platnauer, who was a theatre critic for the Tatler magazine and Pearl Ashton who worked on Vogue. Her early childhood was spent under the guidance of a strict Irish governess at the family residence in Park Square which later became the site for The Prince's Trust. During the Second World War and The Blitz, when children were ordered out of London, Somerville was sent to a boys preparatory school in the Welsh village of Portmeirion. She remained there for three years, being only one of six girls among 70 boys. Following studies in the sciences at Queen's College school, Harley Street, London, Somerville gained admission into the male dominated Guy's Hospital Medical School, where women medical students had been present for only the previous two years and the class was more than 90% men. During her student years, she was influenced by a visit to the school by Alfred Blalock of Johns Hopkins Hospital, whose achievements in treating tetralogy of Fallot with the Blalock Taussig shunt, transformed the lives of children. The once fatal heart disease could now be corrected and turn a blue baby to pink in minutes.  Early medical career National Heart Hospital, Westmoreland Street Somerville initially aimed for a career in heart surgery and worked for heart surgery pioneer Sir Russell Brock. She recognised her own lack of dexterity and later recounted \\"but I was no good because my hands were not connected to my head\\" and changed course to become a cardiologist. She became the first female medical registrar at Guy's Hospital. In 1958, she became a registrar at the National Heart Hospital where cardiologist Paul Wood took her on to his team. Here, her interest in congenital heart disease led her to take on simultaneous work at the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street, London, and she learnt about diseases in babies and surgery with Richard Bonham Carter and David Waterston. In 1967, during a time of significant innovations in heart surgery, Somerville was appointed as a consultant at the National Heart Hospital. She recognised the unmet need of the increasing number of adolescents and adults who were now surviving the heart conditions they were born with, thus founding the concept of GUCH. This new group of survivors had new medical problems and some soon required repeat operations, challenging the cardiologists of the time. Somerville also worked alongside cardio-thoracic surgeon Donald Ross, who chose her to be the cardiologist for the first heart transplantation in the UK in 1968. They co- authored a number of innovative articles, including in 1966, the first report of the use of a homograft aortic valve to repair pulmonary atresia.  Later medical career =Paul Wood ward= In 1975, Somerville, \\"always feisty and prepared for battle\\", succeeded in raising enough funds to open the world's first hospital ward solely for the use of children and adolescents with congenital heart disease. It was named the Paul Wood Ward. The atmosphere differed from a purely children's ward. While it did have a children's play area, guided by a play leader, it also had a kitchen for adolescents and families. Family members could interact with each other, have a coffee and make a snack. This was appreciated by older adolescents, who in turn supported younger ones. =World Congress= In 1980, she held the first World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology in London, a concept she envisaged. In 1988, she enlisted the help of American heart surgeon John W. Kirklin during the first Paediatric Cardiac Surgical Congress in Bergamo, resulting in a collaboration between heart physicians and heart surgeons. Somerville's pioneering GUCH care and teaching led her to be followed by \\"Unicorns\\", her ex-trainees who gather at the World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology every year to celebrate her life and work. In explaining the \\"Unicorns\\", Somerville answered; > I try to teach my fellows that they have to have imagination. You have to be > able to diagnose a disease that you have never seen, or perhaps even read > about, and you have to combine your memory with it. That's why my trainees > are called unicorns, because I used to tell them that there's this imaginary > animal that nobody had ever seen but if you saw one in the ward, you‚Äôd > recognize it. Without the ability to imagine, I‚Äôm not sure you would quite > know what was going on. =Brompton Hospital= The Brompton Hospital incorporated the National Heart Hospital in 1989, however the adolescent ward was not included in the transition. Somerville thereafter worked on re-establishing one, which was later renamed the Jane Somerville GUCH Unit in 1996. In 1995, the British Cardiac Society held the first Paul Wood lecture, which Somerville gave. The title of her speech was \\"The Master's Legacy\\". In 1998, Somerville was appointed emeritus professor of cardiology, Imperial College. She retired a year later. =GUCH Patients Association = In the early 1990s, she founded the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on GUCH and became its chairperson in 1995. The GUCH patients were presenting with numerous problems outside their medical need that she founded and became president of the GUCH patient association in 1994, launched from the now Royal Brompton Hospital. GUCH patients could now talk to each other, seek help for all the social problems and meet to find they were not alone. The organisation was supported by the British Heart Foundation and its name was subsequently changed to the Somerville Foundation in her honour. Awards and honours Somerville is the recipient of the Gold Medal of the European Society of Cardiology, the Guys treasurers Gold Medal in clinical surgery and the Distinguished Service Award of the American College of Cardiology. In 2012, Somerville was named as one of five legends in cardiology at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions. A \\"self-proclaimed trouble maker\\", she shared the event at Chicago with Eugene Braunwald, Valentin Fuster, Antonio Colombo and Magdi Yacoub, when she spoke about her 50 years with heart surgeons. She is the second woman, after Helen Taussig, to enter the Paediatric Cardiology Hall of Fame. Personal life Jane Somerville, roof garden (2019) In 1957, Platnauer married Walter Somerville, who she met in the late 1940s, when she was age 16 and he was staying next door. The couple had four children; one daughter and three sons . Walter died in 2005. Her hobbies include collecting antiques, roof gardening and opera. Retirement Following retirement, Somerville continued to travel the world and teach. The GUCH clinic at the Mater Dei Hospital in Malta is based on her model. In 2013 Somerville was a guest on the BBC's Desert Island Discs with Kirsty Young.

The Asramam maidan is the major training hub of all the driving school operators in Kollam city.  History  British Residency in Asramam, Kollam - Till 1829, Quilon was the capital of the Travancore State and the quarters of the British Residency. Asramam Maidan was used as an aerodrome during the British Raj. At that time there were no civil aerodromes either in Thiruvananthapuram or anywhere else in the erstwhile kingdoms of Travancore and Kochi nor in the British-ruled Malabar area of the Madras Presidency.Aviation school proposal evokes mixed response Chartered flights, mainly using Avro aircraft, would land and take off from Quilon Aerodrome. The aerodrome was primarily used by VIPs from Madras en route to Thiruvananthapuram, who after landing at Quilon, would proceed to Thiruvananthapuram by car. Quilon Aerodrome was also used for flying training. During one such training exercise, an aircraft hit a tree on the boundary of the aerodrome, killing the pilot and the trainee. Training operations were stopped after the accident, but civilian aircraft continued to use the aerodrome. Because of the loose soil in the Asramam area, the landing and take-off areas were prepared by bringing huge quantities of red laterite soil from the hilly areas. The aerodrome had strong barbed wire fencing round it, with two entry points, one at the south and the other at the north. There were no buildings in the aerodrome, not even a shed, although there was a concreted area in the shape of a ring where the planes stopped after landing. It was here that the passengers alighted and boarded the plane. Planes used to land sometimes once in two months. The airport then came under the control of Kerala Public Works Department (PWD). Residents of Asramam knew in advance about the arrival of planes, because the PWD authorities, on getting information about a coming arrival, hoisted a windsock on a tall wooden mast. After the commissioning of Thiruvananthapuram airport and its development, Quilon Aerodrome went into decline, and finally, planes stopped arriving there. The aerodrome remained fenced off for a long time. Later, the fence was destroyed and its granite stumps pilfered. The only reason the maidan was not encroached upon was that it was a central government property. Now there are two large helipads at the maidan.

Considering one of the world's top Greco-Roman wrestlers in his decade, Berzicza had claimed two silver medals each at the World and European Championships, and later represented his nation Hungary in three editions of the Olympic Games (1996, 2000, and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Berzicza trained as part of the wrestling team for Kecskem√©t Gymnastics Club (), under his father and personal coach Ferenc Berzicza. Berzicza made his official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he competed in the men's welterweight class (74 kg). Being successful early in the opening rounds, he entered the quarterfinals powerful and undefeated, but fell to Germany's Erik Hahn with a score 1‚Äì3. Berzicza offered a free pass to finish in seventh at the end of tournament when Bulgaria's Stoyan Stoyanov decided to forfeit the consolation match. The following year, Berzicza emerged into the spotlight with his first career medal in the same category at the 1997 World Wrestling Championships in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, losing his final match to Finland's Marko Yli-Hannuksela. Determined to return to the Olympic scene and medal, Berzicza entered the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as a top medal contender in the men's middleweight division (76 kg). He managed to beat Japan's Takamitsu Katayama in his opening bout, but could not pin Russian wrestler Murat Kardanov in the prelim pool. Finishing second in the elimination round and fourteenth overall, Berzicza's performance was not enough to advance him further into the semifinals as he left the Games in bewilderment. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Berzicza qualified for his third team, as a 28-year-old, in the men's 74 kg class by placing first and receiving a berth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. He lost his opening match against Uzbek wrestler Aleksandr Dokturishvili with a score 2‚Äì4, but managed to eclipse the host nation's Alexios Kolitsopoulos and Azerbaijan's Vugar Aslanov, who did not appear on his final match because of sustained injuries, in the prelim pool.

Today it is playable using ScummVM emulation software. The game features 3rd-person perspective, inventory-based puzzle solving, and side-scrolling cartoon graphics. The rare Windows version of the game is valuable collector's item, some copies were sold for several hundred dollars on eBay in the past and the price has been increasing. 3 Skulls of the Toltecs was commercially successful, with sales of 25,000 units in Spain and 200,000 across Europe. Revistronic followed the game with two sequels: The Westerner (2003) and Fenimore Fillmore's Revenge (2008). Gameplay The game's screen is divided into three sections: a central side-scrolling scenery window containing the characters and the items to manipulate or retrieve, a box in the lower left corner containing different verbs (talk, pick up, give, look), and adjacent to this, an inventory box with all the different objects Fenimore possesses. The game is played by using the mouse cursor to select an item or character in the scenery window, an item in the inventory, and a verb. The game requires a player to select (thereby highlighting to facilitate play) one item from each box; for example: clicking on the hat, then on the word \\"give,\\" and finally on a character makes Fenimore give the hat to the selected character. This game is based on the SCUMM system developed by LucasArts. Plot The game begins in 1866 Arizona when the game's hero, a cowboy named Fenimore Fillmore, tries to rescue an old peddler from a band of attacking rustlers. The dying peddler gives Fenimore a golden skull and tells him the legend of a fabulous treasure that can be found by collecting two other golden skulls. To reach his goal, Fenimore Fillmore must battle the evil Friar Anselmo and the perfidious Colonel Leconte (who also seek the treasure), fight fierce Apaches (whose Chief's son's tepee boasts a sheepskin from Harvard), engage sleepy Mexican revolutionaries (whose leader is amnesic), outwit witty French soldiers (federated with Emperor Maximilian of M√©xico), and suffer the insufferable alcohol-prohibition-ladies league. Solving the puzzles involves fabricating bootleg whiskey, blowing up a bank's safe, escaping from prison, rescuing a pianist from a well, locating and flying a balloon, and turning a devout monk into a gallant rebel general. The game elements emulate Spaghetti Westerns and caricature American Wild West themes. Development 3 Skulls of the Toltecs began development at Erbe Software. It was started by brothers Rodrigo and Hern√°n Castillo, formerly of Dinamic Multimedia. After Erbe dropped 3 Skulls, the pair founded their own company to finish it, under the name Revistronic. Reception According to Gerard Masnou of GameLive PC, 3 Skulls of the Toltecs was commercially successful, with sales of 25,000 units in Spain and 200,000 across Europe. Its international success was unique for an adventure game made in Spain. Masnou remarked in late 2002 that, with regard to market penetration beyond its home country, \\"no Spanish adventure has so far repeated the success\\" of 3 Skulls. At that time, Pendulo Studios' Spanish game Runaway: A Road Adventure had not been released in many countries. Masnou called 3 Skulls critical reception \\"acceptable\\", but Revistronic's Hern√°n Castillo complained that it was underappreciated by Spain's press. PC Joker gave the game a review score of 72% PC Player gave the game a review score of 4 out of 5 Legacy The game received two sequels: The Westerner (2003) and Fenimore Fillmore's Revenge (2009). 3 Skulls of the Toltecs was re-released on GOG.com in June 2019.

Charles Bayliss (1850-4 June 1897), photographer, was born in Hadleigh, Suffolk, England in 1850.Photo Web ‚Äì Charles Bayliss Biography Accessed 5 June 2014 He went to Australia with his parents and they arrived in Melbourne in 1854.  Biography  When about sixteen years old Bayliss met the travelling photographer, Beaufoy Merlin, who came to the Bayliss house in suburban Melbourne while photographing houses and families throughout Victoria, with a view to selling the photographs to people along the way. Merlin operated under the name of the American and Australasian Photographic Company (A & A Photographic Company). Bayliss became Merlin's assistant and the pair travelled extensively throughout Victoria and New South Wales. At the goldfields around Hill End, New South Wales, Merlin and Bayliss met Bernhardt Otto Holtermann, who had become wealthy as the result of successful gold mining. Holtermann employed the A & A Photographic Company to produce a series of photographs of the settled areas of Victoria and New South Wales, which could be sent abroad to advertise the colony and encourage migrants. By September 1873 the major part of New South Wales had been completed. However Merlin died at this time.The Sydney Morning Herald 28 February 1953, page 2 Bayliss, then 23 years old, was contracted to continue the work on the project in both New South Wales and Victoria and, in 1874, Holtermann purchased a mammoth Plate camera for Bayliss and the first images taken with it were of Holtermann's recent purchase of the Post office Hotel in Sydney. Bayliss also completed a panorama of Ballarat using this camera. In 1875 a panorama of Sydney was completed. This was taken from the tower attached to Holtermann's house in North Sydney, now part of Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore). Bayliss was the main photographer, with work also done by Holtermann together with another photographer, Henshaw Clarke. Up to this time Bayliss was based in Melbourne. Then, in 1876, he and the family moved to Sydney and he established a studio in the city. In 1951 approximately 3,500 glass plate photographic negatives were found in the possession of Bernhardt Holtermann's descendants. They were subsequently donated to the Mitchell Library (within the NSW State Library) in Sydney and form the basis of the \\"Holtermann Collection.\\" In fact, Beaufoy Merlin and Charles Bayliss were the photographers. On 7 March 1953, Eric Bayliss, a son of Charles Bayliss, wrote a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald regarding his father's work. He quoted from an obituary for Bayliss, which appeared in the \\"Australian Photographical Review\\" on 19 June 1897, two weeks after the death of Bayliss: \\"He also took the well-known panorama of Sydney and the harbour from the great dome of the Garden Palace in the Domain and, to get this, performed some astonishing and risky feats of climbing and balancing on the outside of the dome. The picture was taken on a series of 18in x 22in plates and, when completed, formed a panoramic view nearly 20ft in length...\\"The Sydney Morning Herald 7 March 1953, page 2. In the letter to the newspaper, Eric Bayliss himself then went on to note that: \\"These, as well as all other work by him, were taken on 'wet plate' negatives. He took a vast number of photographs of Sydney, the suburbs, mountains, and country, as far as the Victorian border, as well as groups and portraits. After Beaufoy Merlin's death, Charles Bayliss took over the business and carried on in his own name until his death. Many of the photographs found in the shed on the property owned by Mr. Holtermann were taken by Charles Bayliss.\\" In 1883 Bayliss had married Christiana Salier. They had seven children together: Raymond Charles (born 1884), Alfred John (1886), Charles (1887‚Äîdied in infancy), Bessie Salier (1888), Emily Annie (1891), Walter Norman (1893), Eric Edward (1896). Alfred and Walter were both killed in France during World War One. On 4 June 1897 Charles Bayliss died at his home, \\"Hadleigh\\" in Wemyss Street, Marrickville, a suburb of Sydney. He had previously caught a chill which swiftly turned to a \\"galloping pneumonia.\\" He left a wife and young family, the oldest child being only 13 years old.The Sydney Morning Herald 5 June 1897, page 1 He is buried at Rookwood Cemetery. The obituary in the \\"Australian Photographical Review\\" (mentioned above) noted that \\"As a man he was ever genial and kindly; as a landscape photographer he had few equals and no superiors. His memory is forever honoured in the hearts of all who knew him.\\" His memory is also forever honoured in the \\"Holtermann Collection,\\" the most important photographic documentation of goldfields life in Australia and an enduring record of life in Australia in the late 19th century.

In 2011, after public pressure France became the first nation to ban hydraulic fracturing, based on the precautionary principle as well as the principal of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards. The ban was upheld by an October 2013 ruling of the Constitutional Council. Some other countries have placed a temporary moratorium on the practice. Countries like the United Kingdom and South Africa, have lifted their bans, choosing to focus on regulation instead of outright prohibition. Germany has announced draft regulations that would allow using hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of shale gas deposits with the exception of wetland areas. The European Union has adopted a recommendation for minimum principles for using high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Its regulatory regime requires full disclosure of all additives. In the United States, the Ground Water Protection Council launched FracFocus.org, an online voluntary disclosure database for hydraulic fracturing fluids funded by oil and gas trade groups and the U.S. Department of Energy. Hydraulic fracturing is excluded from the Safe Drinking Water Act's underground injection control's regulation, except when diesel fuel is used. The EPA assures surveillance of the issuance of drilling permits when diesel fuel is employed. On 17 December 2014, New York state issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing, becoming the second state in the United States to issue such a ban after Vermont.  Approaches  = Risk-based approach = The main tool used by this approach is risk assessment. A risk assessment method, based on experimenting and assessing risk ex-post, once the technology is in place. In the context of hydraulic fracturing, it means that drilling permits are issued and exploitation conducted before the potential risks on the environment and human health are known. The risk-based approach mainly relies on a discourse that sacralizes technological innovations as an intrinsic good, and the analysis of such innovations, such as hydraulic fracturing, is made on a sole cost-benefit framework, which does not allow prevention or ex-ante debates on the use of the technology. This is also referred to as \\"learning-by-doing\\". A risk assessment method has for instance led to regulations that exist in the hydraulic fracturing in the United States (EPA will release its study on the effect of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater in 2014, though hydraulic fracturing has been used for more than 60 years. Commissions that have been implemented in the US to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing have been created after hydraulic fracturing had started in their area of regulation. This is for instance the case in the Marcellus shale area where three regulatory committees were implemented ex-post. Academic scholars who have studied the perception of hydraulic fracturing in the North of England have raised two main critiques of this approach. Firstly, it takes scientific issues out of the public debate since there is no debate on the use of a technology but on its effects. Secondly, it does not prevent environmental harm from happening since risks are taken then assessed instead of evaluated then taken as it would be the case with a precautionary approach to scientific debates. The relevance and reliability of risk assessments in hydraulic fracturing communities has also been debated amongst environmental groups, health scientists, and industry leaders. A study has epitomized this point: the participants to regulatory committees of the Marcellus shale have, for a majority, raised concerns about public health although nobody in these regulatory committees had expertise in public health. That highlights a possible underestimation of public health risks due to hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, more than a quarter of the participants raised concerns about the neutrality of the regulatory committees given the important weigh of the hydraulic fracturing industry. The risks, to some like the participants of the Marcellus Shale regulatory committees, are overplayed and the current research is insufficient in showing the link between hydraulic fracturing and adverse health effects, while to others like local environmental groups the risks are obvious and risk assessment is underfunded. = Precaution-based approach = The second approach relies on the precautionary principle and the principal of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards, using the best available techniques with an acceptable economic cost to insure the protection, the valuation, the restoration, management of spaces, resources and natural environments, of animal and vegetal species, of ecological diversity and equilibriums. The precautionary approach has led to regulations as implemented in France and Vermont, banning hydraulic fracturing.\\"Vermont Act 152\\" Such an approach is called upon by social sciences and the public as studies have shown in the North of England and Australia. Indeed, in Australia, the anthropologist who studied the use of hydraulic fracturing concluded that the risk-based approach was closing down the debate on the ethics of such a practice, therefore avoiding questions on broader concerns that merely the risks implied by hydraulic fracturing. In the North of England, levels of concerns registered in the deliberative focus groups studied were higher regarding the framing of the debate, meaning the fact that people did not have a voice in the energetic choices that were made, including the use of hydraulic fracturing. Concerns relative to risks of seismicity and health issues were also important to the public, but less than this. A reason for that is that being withdrawn the right to participate in the decision- making triggered opposition of both supporters and opponents of hydraulic fracturing. The points made to defend such an approach often relate to climate change and the impact on the direct environment; related to public concerns on the rural landscape for instance in the UK. Energetic choices indeed affect climate change since greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels extraction such as shale gas and oil contribute to climate change. Therefore, people have in the UK raised concerns about the exploitation of these resources, not just hydraulic fracturing as a method. They would hence prefer a precaution-based approach to decide whether or not, regarding the issue of climate change, they want to exploit shale gas and oil.  Framing of the debate  There are two main areas of interest regarding how debates on hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of unconventional oil and gas have been conducted. = \\"Learning- by-doing\\" and the displacement of ethics = A risk-based approach is often referred to as \\"learning-by-doing\\" by social sciences. Social sciences have raised two main critiques of this approach. Firstly, it takes scientific issues out of the public debate since there is no debate on the use of a technology but on its impacts. Secondly, it does not prevent environmental harm from happening since risks are taken then assessed instead of evaluated then taken. Public concerns are shown to be really linked to these issues of scientific approach. Indeed, the public in the North of England for instance fears \\"the denial of the deliberation of the values embedded in the development and application of that technology, as well as the future it is working towards\\" more than risks themselves. The legitimacy of the method is only questioned after its implementation, not before. This vision separates risks and effects from the values entitled by a technology. For instance, hydraulic fracturing entitles a transitional fuel for its supporters whereas for its opponents it represents a fossil fuel exacerbating the greenhouse effect and global warming. Not asking these questions leads to seeing only the mere economic cost-benefit analysis. This is linked to a pattern of preventing non-experts from taking part in scientific-technological debates, including their ethical issues. An answer to that problem is seen to be increased public participation so as to have the public deciding which issues to address and what political and ethical norms to adopt as a society. Another public concern with the \\"learning-by-doing\\" approach is that the speed of innovation may exceed the speed of regulation and since innovation is seen as serving private interests, potentially at the expense of social good, it is a matter of public concern. Science and Technology Studies have theorized \\"slowing-down\\" and the precautionary principle as answers. The claim is that the possibility of an issue is legitimate and should be taken into account before any action is taken. = Variations in risk-assessment of environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing = Issues also exist regarding the way risk assessment is conducted and whether it reflects some interests more than others. Firstly, an issue exists about whether risk assessment authorities are able to judge the impact of hydraulic fracturing in public health. A study conducted on the advisory committees of the Marcellus Shale gas area has shown that not a single member of these committees had public health expertise and that some concern existed about whether the commissions were not biased in their composition. Indeed, among 51 members of the committees, there is no evidence that a single one has any expertise in environmental public health, even after enlarging the category of experts to \\"include medical and health professionals who could be presumed to have some health background related to environmental health, however minimal\\". This cannot be explained by the purpose of the committee since all three executive orders of the different committees mentioned environmental public health related issues. Another finding of the authors is that a quarter of the opposed comments mentioned the possibility of bias in favor of gas industries in the composition of committees. The authors conclude saying that political leaders may not want to raise public health concerns not to handicap further economic development due to hydraulic fracturing. Secondly, the conditions to allow hydraulic fracturing are being increasingly strengthened due to the move from governmental agencies' authority over the issue to elected officials' authority over it. The Shale Gas Drilling Safety Review Act of 2014 issued in Maryland forbids the issuance of drilling permits until a high standard \\"risk assessment of public health and environmental hazards relating to hydraulic fracturing activities\\" is conducted for at least 18 months based on the Governor's executive order.  Institutional discourse and the public  A qualitative study using deliberative focus groups has been conducted in the North of England, where there is a big shale gas reservoir exploited by hydraulic fracturing. These group discussions reflect many concerns on the issue of the use of unconventional oil and gas. There is a concern about trust linked with a doubt on the ability or will of public authorities to work for the greater social good since private interests and profits of industrial companies are seen as corruptive powers. Alienation is also a concern since the feeling of a game rigged against the public rises due to \\"decision making being made on your behalf without being given the possibility to voice an opinion\\". Exploitation also arises since economic rationality that is seen as favoring short-termism is accused of seducing policy-makers and industry. Risk is accentuated by what is hydraulic fracturing as well as what is at stake, and \\"blind spots\\" of current knowledge as well as risk assessment analysis are accused of increasing the potentiality of negative outcomes. Uncertainty and ignorance are seen as too important in the issue of hydraulic fracturing and decisions are therefore perceived as rushed, which is why participants favored some form of precautionary approach. There is a major fear on the possible disconnection between the public's and the authorities' visions of what is a good choice for the good reasons. It also appears that media coverage and institutional responses are widely inaccurate to answer public concerns. Indeed, institutional responses to public concerns are mostly inadequate since they focus on risk assessment and giving information to the public that is considered anxious because ignorant. But public concerns are much wider and it appears that public knowledge on hydraulic fracturing is rather good. The hydraulic fracturing industry has lobbied for permissive regulation in Europe, the US federal government, and US states. On 20 March 2015 the rules for disclosing the chemicals used were tightened by the Obama administration. The new rules give companies involved 30 days from the beginning of an operation on federal land to disclose those chemicals.

Llwydcoed was also an electoral ward of the Aberdare Urban District Council from its formation in 1894. History 1889‚Äì1914 The first representative was the venerable Rees Hopkin Rhys who was succeeded by the Liberal industrialist Rees Llewellyn =Glamorgan County Council= In 1889, Rees Hopkin Rhys was elected as member for Llwydcoed, defeating Griffith George. Rhys was re-elected unopposed in 1892 and although described as a Liberal this was unlikely. Boundary changes in 1895 saw Rhys, now 75 years of age opposed by Richard Morgan, whose Hirwaun seat had been abolished. Rhys was again elected unopposed in 1898 Rhys died in 1899 and was succeeded by Rees Llewellyn. In 1901, Llewellyn was re-elected. He was again re-elected in 1904. Llewellyn was again re-elected unopposed in 1907 Despite occasional challenges by the Labour Party at district council level (see below), labour did not challenge for the county seat in this period. =Aberdare Urban District Council= Llwydcoed was also an electoral ward of the Aberdare Urban District Council from its formation in 1894. In 1899, Owen Harries was again returned unopposed. In 1900, two members were elected owing to the vacant seat following the death of Rees Hopkin Rhys. John William Evans, whip had failed to be elected at the initial election in 1894 but who subsequently became a county councillor and a county alderman, was seventeen votes ahead of sitting councillor Rees Llewellyn. In 1901, Llewellyn was re- elected by a large majority. In 1902, Owen Harris was once again returned unopposed. In 1903, J.W. Evans was re-elected unopposed. In 1904 an additional seat was created, allowing T. Walter Williams to be returned alongside Rees Llewellyn. In 1905, following the death of Owen Harris, his son, Morgan J. Harris, was elected in his place after defeating a Labour candidate. In 1906, John William Evans stood down due to ill health and died shortly afterwards. He was succeeded by J.O. George who defeated a Labour candidate. 1907 saw the return of the sitting members by a comfortable majority. Cynon Valley Borough Council Between 1973 and 1996 Llwydcoed was a ward for Cynon Valley Borough Council.

It was proposed to make it the first criminal trial in British legal history to be held entirely in secret, but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales ruled in June 2014 that some details of the trial should be made public. Background The existence of the prosecutions became publicly known on 4 June 2014, as the outcome of an application by The GuardianCourt of Appeal decision on trial secrecy to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales to overturn a ban on publicly identifying the defendants, which had been issued the month before. The style of cause for the daylight order is Guardian News and Media Ltd v AB and CD. At the earlier closed hearing, Mr Justice Nicol had granted the Crown an order that the trial \\"should take place entirely in private with the identity of both defendants withheld\\" and with \\"a permanent prohibition on reporting what takes place during the trial and their identities\\". The Crown Prosecution Service had argued that they would be deterred from bringing the prosecution without an order for secrecy. The basis for this argument was not made public. On 12 June 2014, Lord Justice Peter Gross, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Burnett issued a ruling overturning the order with respect to the anonymity of the defendants and limiting the degree to which the trial could be heard in private. The ruling stated: The \\"core of the trial\\" remains secret, but the identities of the defendants and the outcome of the trial were ordered to be made public, as well as some details of opening remarks by the judge and prosecution. The court trying the case will have discretion to admit journalists to some parts of the trial, but will retain their notes until the end of the trial, when the court will review what content should or should not be allowed to be made public.Nick Cohen, Secret justice will lead to paranoia ‚Äì and it's not very British, The Observer, 14 June 2014 The Crown Prosecution Service indicated that it did not intend to make any further appeal, and that the trial would go ahead. The trial was due to begin in London on 16 June 2014, but was re- scheduled for October 2014. Arrests and charges The defendants, Erol Incedal (initially known as AB) and Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar (CD), were arrested on Mansell Street, Tower Hamlets, on 13 October 2013 at 7 pm. Two further arrests were made as part of the same operation, one in Peckham and the other in Notting Hill, but neither resulted in charges. It was said in court during the appeal by The Guardian that the defendants were arrested \\"under high profile circumstances\\". Incedal is charged under s 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006 with making preparations for terrorist activity between February 2012 and October 2013. Rarmoul-Bouhadjar is charged with possession of an improperly obtained passport under the Identity Documents Act 2010. Both defendants are charged under s 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 with possessing documents likely to be useful in the commission of terrorist activity (this has been alleged to refer to a document titled \\"bomb-making\\"). =Early reaction= In early June 2014, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Chris Grayling defended the order for secrecy,guardian.com: \\"Secret trials: judges should be trusted to make right decisions, says Grayling\\" 5 Jun 2014 saying: \\"If it is in the interests of justice for the judge to take a decision one way or the other, so be it, that's why we have them. That's why we trust the judges.\\" The home secretary, Theresa May, and the foreign secretary, William Hague, had both submitted certificates requesting the trial to be held in total secrecy. The order was criticised by Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty for its \\"extensive restrictions set without robust reasons or a time limit\\". Questions about the effect of holding a secret trial were asked by Sadiq Khan, the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, and Keith Vaz the Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee. The Daily Telegraph's Philip Johnston likened the trial to the Inquisition and the Star Chamber.telegraph.co.uk: \\"Secret trials: 'Democracies die behind closed doors'\\" 5 Jun 2014 Columnist Jenny McCartney pointed out that over three decades of terrorism in Northern Ireland, a criminal trial had never before been conducted in absolute secrecy.telegraph.co.uk: \\"The trial that has to be heard in secret ‚Äì and don‚Äôt ask why\\" (McCartney) 5 Jun 2014 Melanie Phillips argued that holding the trial in total secrecy was justified. On 12 June 2014 Conservative MP Dominic Raab asked for a debate in the Commons over a bid to hold a terror trial in complete secrecy. The former Foreign Office lawyer, who had worked with the intelligence services, said that even after the ruling to lift some of the restrictions, only \\"hand-picked\\" journalists would be allowed to cover the trial.telegraph.co.uk: \\"MP demands debate on secret terror trial\\", 12 Jun 2014 Trials One of the two defendants, Mounir Rarmoul- Bouhadjar, aged 26, pleaded guilty the week of 6 October 2014 to the possession of a terrorist document.telegraph.co.uk: \\"Secret terror trial hears Tony Blair's property was a target\\" 14 Oct 2014 =First trial= The other defendant, Erol Incedal, also aged 26, denied two charges at the Old Bailey in London on 14 October 2014: one offence of preparing acts of terrorism and the other offence of possessing a document entitled Bomb Making. The charges stem from examination of objects in the possession of Incedal, who was arrested while driving a black Mercedes. A paper was found hidden amongst his possessions which listed the residential address of Tony Blair. On 31 October 2014, Incedal denied terrorism offences, saying he had contemplated committing an armed robbery or buying heroin or a gun instead.telegraph.co.uk: \\"Secret trial: Erol Incedal claims he was plotting robbery not terror attack\\", 31 Oct 2014 On 11 November 2014 it was reported that, for undisclosed reasons, the trial jury had been discharged but that a retrial would be sought.bbc.co.uk: \\"'Secret' terror trial jury discharged at Old Bailey\\", 11 Nov 2014 On 17 November 2014, the jury convicted Incedal on the charge of possession of terrorist information, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on another charge of preparing an act of terrorism.telegraph.co.uk: \\"Erol Incedal secret terror trial: suspect convicted of possessing terrorist information\\", 17 Nov 2014 =Re-trial= On 26 March 2015, Incedal was acquitted by the jury on the charge of preparing an act of terrorism. The details of Incedal's successful defence remain subject to secrecy. A small part of the trial was heard in the presence of ten accredited journalists, and a small proportion in open court. In December 2015 transcripts detailing part of Incedal‚Äôs defence were released. A challenge in the High Court was made by the news media, citing the principle of open justice. The lord chief justice was expected to rule on the media challenge in January 2016., the ruling came through on 9 February and the gagging order was upheld.

Scoveston is a relatively new village, and the first recording of the name was in the 15th century. It is in the parish and community of Llanstadwell. History The earliest-known record of Scoveston is from the 15th century, with some other settlements in the immediate area dating from the 16th to 18th centuries. In 1644-45, Thomas Butler of Scoveston was High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire. By 1863, the house had been rebuilt and was occupied by William Rees, another High Sheriff. Scoveston and Upper Scoveston appear on a pre-1850 parish map of Llanstadwell, but were not mentioned in 19th century gazetteers. Richard Fenton, in his 1811 Pembrokeshire tour, noted the mansion at Scoveston as being a venerable building transmuted into a farm-house, and having been owned by the Mordaunt family, one which was poorly documented. Upper Scoveston (also referred to as Scoveston Park or Scoveston Manor) was noted by the 1911 Royal Commission as including a boathouse, possible isolated geometric copses, sundial, well, walled garden and lake. On modern maps, the name is applied to the road passing through the settlement, as well as Upper Scoveston, Lower Scoveston, Middle Scoveston and Scoveston Grove. In 1985, Scoveston Manor was the scene of a double murder and extensive fire. John Cooper was later convicted of this and other crimes. The following year, the house was sold and repurposed.

The mission of the NGO is to raise awareness about the extent of corruption in order to exert leverage on public administrations and Lebanese citizens at large to refrain from engaging in acts of corruption. Sakker El Dekkene runs guerrilla advertising campaigns and uses an online reporting mechanism and a telephone hotline to collect data on bribery taking place throughout the country. Background The Sakker El Dekkene initiative was launched due to the perception that corruption in Lebanon is simply a way of life. Lebanon has consistently been ranked among the world's most corrupt countries, with corruption and bribery taking place from the highest echelons of government and private business to everyday interactions between citizens. Sakker El Dekkene was set up to effect wholesale change in the national consciousness. By increasing the visibility of the rampant corruption taking place, the NGO hopes to raise the issue as a major topic of public discourse and sow the seeds of radical change.  Activities  = Dekkenet Al Balad = Sakker El Dekkene was launched on 15 May 2014, with the opening of \\"Dekkenet Al Balad\\" in Gemmayzeh, Beirut. Dekkenet Al Balad was a temporary shop which was opened by the NGO with the intention of physically manifesting the idea behind the whole initiative: that Lebanon is a cornershop where everything- including your rights- is for sale. = Guerrilla campaign = Sakker El Dekkenne launched a guerilla campaign that included stencilling, postering and even the creation of an \\"Anti- Corruption Car\\" that parks outside corrupt public institutions encouraging people to report acts of bribery that they have taken part in or witnessed. = Film = As a part of the launch of the initiative, a film illustrating the problem of corruption in Lebanon was designed. It had been viewed tens of thousands of times within a few days of its publication on YouTube.com The video can be viewed here: * = Website = The NGO also launched http://www.sakkera.com. This website contains the reporting mechanism for reporting bribes and gives a detailed overview of reported incidents all over Lebanon. The website also contains details of publications and events, relevant legal information, an \\"integrity test\\", information about the NGO and links to relevant articles about the NGO and corruption at large. = App = There is also a mobile app that can be downloaded from the website which allows the individual to report corruption on the move and contains much of the information accessible through the website. = Social Media = Sakker El Dekkenne also has a Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/sakkerel.dekkene?fref=ts) which is regularly updated with news and information about corruption in Lebanon and the work of the NGO. There is also an interactive game whereby Facebook users can \\"purchase\\" items such as driving licenses in order to help raise awareness about the NGO. = Hotline = Reporting bribes online is not the only mechanism through which Sakker El Dekkene compiles its information. A hotline at +961 76808080 is also available for citizens to report incidents of bribery and corruption. = Educational Programs = Sakker el Dekkene has developed training programs to give young participants the knowledge and skills to fight corruption. Sakker el Dekkene has worked with different schools in various ways: short lectures, stunt activities, and more elaborate programmes. Research Sakker el Dekkene has produced several reports to gain factual knowledge about the actual degree of corruption in specific areas. The reports can be found on the site of Sakker El Dekkenehttps://www.sakkera.com/news.php?page=reports =Customs Report= In the bribe reports conducted by Sakker el Dekkene, customs and the Port of Beirut are often mentioned and rank as the 5th most corrupt institution. The research found that the cost per container for a trouble-free ride through customs varies between 75,000 LBP and 150,000 LBP, whether the declaration is legal or not. In the analysis of the 2013 trade data, a total of $794.2 million is paid in small bribes, big bribes, and unpaid VAT. = Integrity Compliance Report = The Integrity Compliance Report has been a cooperation between Sakker el Dekkene and the Ministry of Economy and Trade in the period December 2015 - June 2016. A survey conducted with 68 employees of the Ministry led to 3 key findings: * Ministry's leadership is perceived to be willing to fight corruption and leading by example * Anti-corruption policies, processes and governance are weak and non- existent within the ministry * Several types of corruption are visible in the Ministry The survey conducted with key stakeholders in private institutions led to 3 key findings: * Performance has been improving over the past 5 yards * Ministry's leadership is perceived as lacking integratie * The Ministry's procedures are perceived as lacking transparency Additionally, while shadowing 17 field inspectors, key gaps in service delivery and potential for corruption was identified. The report also recommends policies to overcome these key gaps.  Awards  Sakker el Dekkene won the first Wajih Ajouz Award for best online activism campaign on October 17, 2014. In December of the same year, Sakker el Dekkene campaign was awarded 9 prizes at the Cristal Festival Europe. The prizes include: *Grand Prix for Best Integrated Content Campaign for the MENA region *Brand Entertainment Academy Grand Prix *1 Gold in Best Use or Integration of Experiential events *1 Gold in Best Integrated Content Campaign *1 Gold in Best Product Launch *1 Silver in Integrated Campaign *1 Silver in Best use of Ambient *1 Bronze in Best Launch Campaign *1 Bronze in Integrated Campaign In 2015 Sakker el Dekkene won 17 awards at various Award Festivals for its creative, integrated and interactive campaigns.

He is known for his studies investigating connections between tattooing and criminal behaviour, as well as his research on hanging and its physiological effects on the human body. He was the founder of the Legal Medicine Association of Romania and the publisher of the Romanian journal of Legal Medicine. He also served as mayor of BƒÉneasa, Bucharest. Early life and education Minovici was born in R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat on 23 October 1868. He attended the Saint Sava National College and had two older brothers, Mina Minovici and »òtefan Minovici. In 1898 he obtained his Ph.D. in forensic science with a thesis on Tattoos in Romania. He also took additional courses in psychiatry and pathological anatomy. Research His research on the effects of hanging on the human body included performing multiple hanging experiments on himself, each lasting for a period of approximately five seconds. Minovici performed twelve hanging experiments involving himself as the subject. He used a dynamometer attached to a knot which he then tied around his neck and experimented with various positions of the knot around his neck, observing associated phenomena such as vision disturbances, change of skin colouring and ringing in his ears as well as the speed of the onset of these symptoms. He also attempted between six and seven hangings with the assistance of his aides and only experienced pain on the occasion when his feet lost contact with the ground. One of his assistants pulled the rope while loudly counting the time allotted for the experiment. In the initial experiments the knot was not constricting and his feet were raised two metres above ground. In this configuration, after a progressive series of experiments each lasting longer than its predecessor, he was able to remain hanging for a maximum of twenty five seconds. In his final experiment using a regular, constricting, hangman's knot he was able to stand only for four seconds, before he gave the signal to his aides to stop the experiment. During that experiment his feet had remained in contact with the ground. Nevertheless, he experienced pain, while swallowing, for a month following that experiment. He also performed choking experiments on volunteers by applying pressure on their carotid arteries and jugular veins for up to five seconds, until the faces of his subjects became red. During their post-experiment accounts, the volunteers recounted experiences such as vision problems, heat sensation in the head, as well as paraesthesias such as a tingling and numbing sensation in multiple places of their bodies. His research on hanging was published in a 200-page work titled Study on hanging, in two language editions. The Romanian edition was published in 1904 while the French language one was published in 1905. Death Minovici died in Bucharest in 1941 from an illness affecting his vocal cords. He died a bachelor, bequeathing his estate, including his home, which was built by architect Cristofi Cerchez, and a collection of Romanian folk art, to his country. His home is now an ethnological museum.

Considered as one of the world's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Zakharuk had claimed five European championship titles, picked up three bronze medals at the World Championships (1999, 2002, and 2003), and achieved top eight finishes in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Zakharuk trained as a member of the freestyle wrestling team for Ukraina Kiev Sport Club, under his coach Serhiy Obesnyuk. Zakharuk entered the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, as a top medal contender, in the men's bantamweight category (54 kg), after claiming a bronze from the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Ankara, Turkey. During the preliminary pool, Zakharuk pinned neighboring Russia's Leonid Chuchunov on his opening bout, and then eclipsed Bulgaria's Ivan Tsonov with a powerful effort and a 10-point advantage to earn him a spot for the quarterfinals. Followed by the next morning's session, Zakharuk fell behind U.S. wrestler and 1998 world champion Sammie Henson with a score 4‚Äì8, before he sought a chance to fight back in a consolation battle against Kazakhstan's Maulen Mamyrov for a fifth- place finish. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Zakharuk qualified for his second Ukrainian squad, as a 28-year-old, in the men's featherweight class (55 kg) with another brilliant sporting record. After the abolition of the bantamweight division in amateur wrestling that propelled him to fight at least a single kilogram heavier than in 2000, Zakharuk picked up his third career bronze medal in the men's featherweight category at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, which earned him a spot on the Ukrainian Olympic team. He continued to deliver a more stellar performance from Sydney four years earlier by pinning Kazakhstan's Baurzhan Orazgaliyev and overpowering Belarusian wrestler and 2001 world champion Herman Kantoyeu to seize another shot of an Olympic medal. Fighting against Russia's Mavlet Batirov in the quarterfinal match, Zakharuk could not score a single point to push him off the mat, and instead, managed to finish only in seventh at the end of the tournament.

Under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Henning Lobin, director of the Institute, and Prof. Dr. Arnulf Deppermann, vice director of the institute, IDS employs a staff of about 160. The IDS was established in Mannheim in 1964 and is still headquartered there. It is the central extramural institute for research and documentation of the German language in its contemporary usage and its recent history. As a member of the Leibniz-Gemeinschaft (Leibniz- Association), the IDS is financed both by the federal government and by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  Organization and structure  The work of the IDS is divided into four departments and two central sections: * Department of Grammar * Department of Lexical Studies * Department of Pragmatics *Department of Digital Linguistics * Department of Central Research * Public Relations, Documentation, and Library Section  Research  In the Department of Grammar, the grammatical structure of contemporary German is identified and described. The department is divided into two areas that work with contemporary theoretical and methodological standards of German linguistics and simultaneously employ computational-linguistic and statistical methods. Research is conducted in two areas, the area Description and Development of Grammatical Knowledge and the area Language Technologies and Information Systems. The Rat f√ºr Deutsche Rechtschreibung (Council for German Orthography) is also affiliated with this department. The Department of Lexical Studies deals with lexicological, lexicographical, and corpus-based research in which specific lexical fields are studied, enabling comprehensive documentation of the German vocabulary. Research is conducted in the following three areas: Lexicography and Documentation of Language, Lexical Syntagmatics and Empirical and Digital Lexical Studies. The Department of Pragmatics researches language use and language variation, that is, the form and development of linguistic diversity. In particular, spoken language usage is considered. The area Interaction is a leading international center for conversation research and interactional linguistics. The area Spoken Corpora includes archives, such as the \\"Archiv f√ºr Gesprochenes Deutsch (AGD)\\" (the Archive for spoken German). The Department of Digital Linguistics is divided into two areas. The area Research Coordination and Research Infrastructure deals with tasks and projects related to the internal and external communication of information and networking. The area Corpus Linguistics supervises the expansion, annotation, and analysis of (written language) electronic corpora of German and develops methods and techniques of corpus-linguistic, empirical research. The research activities pursuing predominantly cross-departmental objectives are directly subordinate to the Director and pooled together in the organizational unit Central Research, for instance, the program areas Research Infrastructures and Corpus Linguistics belong to this unit. The area Language in the public sphere investigates issues that affect the status and function of the German language in society. The Public Relations Section manages the areas of public relations and the media, publications, documentation, and the library. Within the framework of its support services, the IDS maintains the German Language Archive, which is the largest collection of audio recordings of spoken German. Prospective users can order audio documentation and transcripts. Besides, the IDS provides online the archive corpora of written language (nine million book pages) as well as a specialized library that collects literature that encompasses all areas of present-day German linguistics.

Born in the village of Shala Pecaj, Dukagjini, he represented the general uprising of the Malsia Highlands against the Ottoman Empire and the Montenegrin forces. In 1883, in √áezm√´ in Koplik, Mehmet Shpendi, in the name of Dukagjin, sided with Ded Gjo Luli in order to resist the commission of Xhibalit which was formed in 1856 with the purpose of tricking the Montenegrins. In 1890 Mehmet Shpendi founded the \\"Shala Djelmnia\\", an Albanian patriotic organization. In 1910 the forces of Mehmet Shpendi fought the Ottoman general Shevket Turgut Pasha, where 3000 Albanian highlanders were involved in the battle of Qaf√´ and Agri against the Ottomans. The Ottoman battalions numbered 20 and were supplied with artillery cannons and modern weapons. The Ottomans were frightened by the fierce fighting of the Highlanders and they lost the battle. Shpendi later gathered his Shal√´ forces, joined the Highlanders of the Hoti tribe with their chieftain Ded Gjo Luli and both refused to pay Ottoman taxes and to give up their weapons. Ottoman forces pursued them and the Highlanders entered Montenegro. In 1911, Ded Gjo Luli and Mehmet Shpendi rose the flag Albanian flag for the first time in 400 years in the victorious battle of Decic. He is regarded as a local hero. On 28 May 1911, the Highlander tribes organized a meeting at the Bridge of Shala where they decided that all of Dukagjin were to participate in an armed insurrection. The Ottoman government announced for an amnesty for the freedom fighters, seeing the risk of the spreading insurgency. The Foreign minister of the Ottomans sought to meet the leaders of the Highlanders. Ded Gjo Luli and Mehmet Shpendi is said to have told the minister that \\"We have nothing to speak of. We will speak with you through our barrels.\\" After the defeat of the Ottomans, Shpendi continued to fight the Montenegrin invaders.

It is a single-story structure, its original core built out of heavy timber framing. It is covered by a gabled roof and sheathed in wooden clapboards. A square tower rises above the east-facing front facade. The main facade is three bays wide, with corner pilasters rising to an entablature and fully pedimented gable. The main entrance is at its center, topped by a large multipane transom window. The tower has a plain first stage finished in clapboards, while the second stage, housing the belfry, is finished in flushboarding with louvered openings. The structure was built in 1842 as a church. In 1875, the building was sold to the local grange chapter, which enlarged the building in the 1880s, adding to its length. This additional space provided interior space for a stage, which was used for grange rituals and dramatic presentations.

He was the son of Jos√® Miguel Maria del Refugio Sabas Muzquiz Gonzalez, who was captured by the Mescalero as a boy at what is now Melchor M√∫zquiz in Coahuila, Mexico, and raised among them, and his Indian wife. When he came of age and proved himself, Alsate became the leader of a Mescalero band.Luis L√≥pez Elizondo and Franklin W. Daugherty, \\"Documentos de la genealog√≠a y la vida de Alsate, jefe de los Apaches de los Chisos\\", Relaciones 23.92 (2002) 137-58, p. 138 (pdf) They ranged through the Limpia Mountains (later rebaptized Davis Mountains by Anglo-American newcomers), Chisos Mountains and Chinati Mountains in the Big Bend area of Texas, the Sierra del Carmen of Coahuila and the Sierra Alamos in Chihuahua north of the Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠.  War-leader and chief  In 1849 Alsate was a war leader in the failed Mescalero and Lipan expedition against Santa Rosa of Coahuila, scheduled on december 24th, 1849. The Mescaleros, mostly the southern bands, known as Guadalupe and Limpia Mescalero, used to frequent \\"Fort Leaton\\" settled by North-american barterer Ben Leaton in 1848 at old adobe building already called \\"El Fortin\\", on the Texan side of the Rio Grande near Presidio (Texas), largely extended on the surrounding grounds along the shore and equipped with warehouses and corrals, where the Apaches could get guns, gunpowder and ammunitions in exchange for the booty of their raids to Chihuahua and Coahuila, and the Chisos had become Fort Leaton's very active customers and suppliers. During the decades 1850' - 1860' Alsate, by now war-chief and then principal chief of the Chisos band, and one among the most important Limpia Mescalero chiefs after Gomez's disappearance, became a most notorious Apache raider, being operative through Texas, Chihuahua and Coahuila and dominating the Texan Big Bend area. During the decades 1860' - 1870', while the Northern (Sierra Blanca and Sacramento) Mescaleros had been forced to accept their restriction in a reservation, the Southern (Guadalupe e Limpia) Mescaleros saved their freedom and didn't give up the old way of raiding along both sides of the Rio Grande, sometimes in partnership with the Mimbre√±os or the Lipans, and Alsate's Chisos band was a leading player. As well as Carnoviste, chief of a Guadalupe Mescalero band, Alsate too became a close ally to Victorio about 1874. Relations between the Indians and the authorities on both sides of the border were generally peaceful at first, although Alsate was almost shot for stealing the coat of the trader John D. Burgess; Alsate's band had intended to rob Burgess' convoy but the two talked and ended up as friends, and Burgess had given Alsate his coat as a gift.L√≥pez Elizondo and Daugherty, pp. 139-40. Victorio's breakout from San Carlos Reservation in September 1877 alarmed the troops in the whole Apache territory, and, in November‚ÄìDecember 1877, Alsate's warriors clashed twice with 8th Cavalry: on November 30, companies A and K, respectively led by Capt. A.B. Wells with Lt. F.E. Phelps, and by Capt. S.B. Young with Lt. John L. Bullis, trespassed the Rio Grande border running after Alsate's band in the Sierra Madre del Carmen, Mexico, killing or wounding some Apaches, destroying the camp and capturing some horses, donkeys and mules; on December 4, Capt. Young, with troop K, and Lt. Bullis, with a detachment of [negro-]Seminole scouts, after chasing the Chisos for several weeks, attacked the Apache group led by Alsate and his sub-chiefs Zorrillo (Chisos Limpia Mescaleros) and Colorado (probably the chief of a smaller Lipan band joint to the Chisos Mescaleros, and likely to be identified with Avispa Colorada, connected to Alsate e Carnoviste in 1874); Alsate led his people to Chihuahua. Alsate felt himself safe in his stronghold near San Carlos of Chihuahua, but, in 1878, complaints to the Mexican authorities about the band's raids on farms and traders brought President Porfirio D√≠az to order Alsate's arrest; Colonel Jos√© Garza Gal√°n de Santa Rosa was dispatched with a force of a hundred men and surprised him and his followers at his farm near San Carlos de Chihuahua, and they were extradited to Mexico City to be jailed in la Acordada. Alsate's father was in the group and was freed after convincing his brother Manuel of his identity.L√≥pez Elizondo and Daugherty, pp. 140-41. Manuel M√∫zquiz wrote a note requesting clemency for Alsate, but could not release him; however, in December 1879 he and his followers were able to escape from the carts transporting them and vanish into the mountains.L√≥pez Elizondo and Daugherty, p. 141.  Last standing and death  The following year Colonel Ortiz of El Paseo del Norte lured them into a trap at San Carlos of Chihuahua by promising a peace treaty; they were set upon after eating and drinking heavily at a celebratory feast, and while those few who were able to fight were killed, the rest were sold into slavery.L√≥pez Elizondo and Daugherty, p. 142.

Outlet was founded in 1968. The newspaper was edited by Tim Hector and James Knight. It functioned as a weekly organ of the Antigua Caribbean Liberation Movement (ACLM). For the ACLM the newspaper played a very important role. In its heyday Outlet claimed a circulation of around 5,000 copies, thus being the most widely read newspaper on Antigua. As of the early 1970s, Outlet and Standard (which appeared on irregular basis) were the sole opposition newspapers in the country. Outlet was outspoken against corruption in the country. It argued that the Vere Bird government was guilty of lax control of casino businesses, peddling passports to non-Antiguans, mismanaging foreign loans, and using Antigua and Barbuda to launder arms shipments to South Africa.countrystudies.us. Government and Politics Due to its criticisms, Outlet was often targeted by the government. In June 1978 Antigua Printing and Publishing Company ceased to print Outlet. The company claimed that the decision was motivated by fears that Outlet risked a libel lawsuit. In 1982 Outlet was pressured by the government to apply for a surety bond, following fresh criticism of government corruption in its articles. Then on 23 July 1982 around twenty police officers raided the Outlet office, seizing documents and mailing lists of subscribers. The police claimed that the seized materials were secret government documents and that the publishers would be charged under the Official Secrets Act (it later turned out that the documents were publications of UNESCO and documents from Barbados about the Space Research Corporation). The Commissioner of Police Edric Potter declared that publishing of Outlet would be banned as of 31 July 1982. On 26 July 1982, a break-in at the office occurred, and equipment worth 8,000 East Caribbean dollars was stolen. Copies of the 21 August 1982 issue of Outlet were seized by police. These events prompted the newspaper to bring the government in front of High Court, charging it with trying to deny the newspaper its \\"constitutional right\\" to publish. On 4 September 1982, the High Court ruled that Outlet was a legitimate newspaper with constitutional right to be published. In 1984 accusations of corruption and maladministration published by ACLM pressured the government to call fresh elections. In May 1985 Hector was charged with spreading 'false statements' about the government and the Commissioner of Police. In 1990 the Privy Council found the charges unconstitutional. The office the newspaper was targeted by arsonists, following a November 1998 article in Outlet charging the government with secretly having imported weaponry for half a million dollars.

Considered as one of the world's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Kantoyeu became a freestyle wrestling champion in the 54-kg division at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships, and later represented his nation Belarus in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Kantoyeu was also a member of the Belarusian national wrestling team since the breakup of the Soviet Union, under his personal coach Valentin Murzinkov. Kantoyeu made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's bantamweight category (54 kg). He pinned Cuba's Wilfredo Garc√≠a on his opening bout, but could not beat Kyrgyzstan's Nurbin Donbaev with a score 2‚Äì5 in the prelim pool. Despite a single loss, Kantoyeu still managed to secure a spot for the quarterfinals because of the most points collected from the elimination round. Followed by the next morning's session, Kantoyeu delivered a striking effort to edge Kazakhstan's Maulen Mamyrov off the mat in his next match, before falling behind U.S. wrestler and 1998 world champion Sammie Henson in the semifinals without scoring a single point. He faced against Greece's Amiran Kardanov in the bronze medal match, but nearly missed out the podium by single point behind his opponent with a score 4‚Äì5, finishing only in fourth place. Determined to return again to the wrestling scene, Kantoyeu greatly emerged as a top medal contender at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, where he beat Iran's Babak Nourzad to take home the gold medal in the men's bantamweight category. In 2002, Kantoyeu took a year off from the tournament because of sustained injuries, but sought his official return at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, where he reaped an astonishing defeat from Japan's Chikara Tanabe in his opening match. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kantoyeu qualified for his second Belarusian squad, as a 33-year-old, in the men's featherweight class (55 kg) by receiving a berth and placing second behind Cuba's Ren√© Montero from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. He lost his opening bout to Ukrainian wrestler and 2003 world bronze medalist Oleksandr Zakharuk, but scored a single triumph to subdue Kazakhstan's Baurzhan Orazgaliyev in the prelim pool.

It has pinnate leaves arranged in opposite pairs with between three and thirteen leaflets and panicles of small flowers arranged in leaf axils or on the ends of branches. It grows along streams in rainforest. Description Bosistoa pentacocca is a tree that typically grows to a height of about . It has grey, blotchy and scaly bark and pinkish-red new growth. The leaves are pinnate, long on a petiole long and there are between three and thirteen elliptical to lance-shaped leaflets. The leaflets are long and wide, the side leaflets sessile or with a petiolule up to long and the end leaflet sessile or on a petiolule up to long. The flowers are long and arranged in panicles in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets. The sepals are about long and joined for most of their length, the petals long. Flowering occurs from January to February and the fruit is a follice long and wide containing a single seed long. Taxonomy Ferny-leaf bosistoa was first formally described in1862 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Euodia pentacocca and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. In 1873, Henri Ernest Baillon changed the name to Bosistoa pentacocca in his book Histoire des Plantes. In 2013, Paul Irwin Forster describe two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Bosistoa pentacocca subsp. connaricarpa Domin P.I.Forst. that has leaves with between three and five, rarely seven leaflets; * Bosistoa pentacocca (F.Muell.) Baill. subsp. pentacocca that has leaves with between seven and thirteen leaflets.

Office of the Republic for Protection of Cultural Monuments - Belgrade, Retrieved 18 June 2014.  The establishment of the National Bank  The establishment of the Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia was a long process consequent on the development of the economy, currency and other financial institutions, as well as the needs of economic and political emancipation of the Kingdom of Serbia. The Bank was formally launched after the adoption of the Law on the National Bank, 12 December 1882, which was confirmed by king Milan Obrenovic on 6 January 1883. Under this law, the Bank was established as a privileged institution (for the next 25 years in the form of a joint stock company), with an initial capital of 20 million dinara, and it was envisaged that its activities would be conducted under the control of the state. Officially, the Bank began operations on 1 June 1884. On that date, the bank leased space taken in Knez Mihajlo no. 38 (now No. 50), at the house of Hristina Kumanudi.http://beogradskonasledje.rs National Bank building, Retrieved 18 June. 2014.  Construction of the building  As its temporary accommodation was inadequate, land was purchased for the construction of a new building in 1886 on the corner of Dubrovacka and Prince Lazar streets. Interior, vestibule of the older part of the building In 1887, a draft plan for the new building was adopted, drawn up by two architects employed in the Ministry of Construction. However, the Board of Directors decided to assign project development to Konstantin Jovanoviƒá, then already affirmed architect, and son of a lithographer Anastas Jovanoviƒá. The Bank project was also his first job in Belgrade. Construction of the building was entrusted to contractors Jirasek and Kraus from Szeged. The work lasted from 1889 until its official completion on 15 March 1890. The importance of the new building was reflected in the award to Konstantin A. Jovanoviƒá in 1890 of the Order of St. Sava, class III. The bank's report for 1890 said: \\"...the Bank has a house of which she can be proud of, as can our capital, which she serves to ornament\\". Great credit goes to architect Kosta Jovanoviƒá who developed the plans and under whose supervision the building was constructed. After World War I, the Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia became the National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Between 1922‚Äì25, the bank building was extended to cater for its space requirements, to fill the entire area of the city block, in the form of an irregular pentagon. Jovanoviƒá again carried out the extension, in a style consistent with the older part of the building. It is a closed block with an internal atrium courtyard, and has been preserved to date. Jovanoviƒá modelled the building stylistically on the architecture of late-Renaissance palaces of 16th-century Italy. It also appears to be influenced by Jovanoviƒá' professor and prominent Viennese architect Gottfried Semper.  Architecture  Jovanoviƒá's immediate models were Palazzo Farnese in Rome, designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Michelangelo (1513, and 1534‚Äì46), and Semper's mid-19th-century Oppenheim Palace in Dresden. The Bank building best embodies a characteristic feature of Jovanoviƒá's concept of architectural design: variation on a Renaissance fa√ßade theme combined with an eclectic approach obvious in the use of elements of Baroque architectural decoration.–û –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∏ –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–µ –±–∞–Ω–∫–µ —É –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥—É: –â–∏—ô–∞–Ω–∞ –ë–∞–±–∏—õ, –ñ–∏–≤–æ—Ç –∏ —Ä–∞–¥ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–µ –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –ê. –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ–∞, –ø–æ—Å–µ–±–Ω–∏ –¥–µ–æ, –ó–ê–§ VI-2, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1961; –â–∏—ô–∞–Ω–∞ –ë–∞–±–∏—õ, –ñ–∏–≤–æ—Ç –∏ —Ä–∞–¥ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–µ –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –ê. –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ–∞, –æ–ø—à—Ç–∏ –¥–µ–æ, –ó–ê–§ V-6 1960; –â—É–±–æ–º–∏—Ä –ù–∏–∫–∏—õ, –ò–∑ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–æ–Ω—Å–∫–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ–∞ —É –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥—É, –ì–ì–ë XXIII, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1976. 127-130; –î—Ä. –î–∏–≤–Ω–∞ –Ç—É—Ä–∏—õ –ó–∞–º–æ–ª–æ, –ì—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ç–µ—ô–∏ –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞ 1815-1914, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1981. 55; –ì–æ—Ä–¥–∞–Ω–∞ –ì–æ—Ä–¥–∏—õ, –ü–∞–ª–∞—Ç–∞ –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–µ –±–∞–Ω–∫–µ, –ù–∞—Å–ª–µ—í–µ II, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1999. 85-94; –í–µ—Ä–∞ –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤–∏—õ-–õ–æ–Ω—á–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, –ì–æ—Ä–¥–∞–Ω–∞ –ì–æ—Ä–¥–∏—õ, –ê—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω –ê. –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 2001; –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä –ö–∞–¥–∏—ò–µ–≤–∏—õ, –ï—Å—Ç–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–µ –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏–∑–º–∞ (XIX-XX –≤–µ–∫), –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 2005. 314, 315, 354; –ò–≤–∞–Ω –ö–ª–µ—É—Ç, –ì—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ç–µ—ô—Å–∫–∏ –æ–ø—É—Å –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ–∞ —É –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥—É, –ì–ì–ë LIII, 2006. 214-249; –î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∞ –ó–∞–≤–æ–¥–∞ –∑–∞ –∑–∞—à—Ç–∏—Ç—É —Å–ø–æ–º–µ–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∫—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–µ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞ –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞.

The zones are clearly defined by the contrast between the rusticated lower and calmer upper zones, separated by a prominent stringcourse. The heavy and monolithic rustication of the basement and ground- floor zone, tempered by the regular rhythm of arch-headed windows, is a clear reference to the Florentine 15th-century palazzo. The monotony of the ground floor is broken by formal entrances facing Kralja Petra and Cara Lazara streets. The upper zones display less restraint. The strict hierarchy of the first-floor composition pattern is given a more dynamic edge by alternating differently topped windows and accentuating the imposing windows above the entrances. The second-floor zone, simplified by a row of less ornate window openings, is surmounted by a protruding cornice and a balustraded parapet. =Interior design= Interior design of the building The artistically rich design of interior spaces includes a large number of functional and decorative arts and crafts objects, which form an integral part of the architecture of the building. Particular emphasis was placed on the design of functional nodes: the vestibule in the earlier part of the building and the counter hall in the later one. Being accessible to the public, these spaces were elaborately decorated in the neo-Renaissance style, with a composition pattern based on contrasts between full and empty surfaces, and calm monochrome and vibrant polychrome details, on the generous use of floral ornamentation, and on the alternation of different materials. Interior design of the building The general impression of luxury and monumentality of the interior is reinforced by an ensemble of decorative wall painting, one of the best preserved and most prestigious created in the early 20th century. It followed European trends of the time and was conceived as fully subordinate to architecture. This type of decorative painting is understandably devoid of the painter's personal touch and probably follows a pattern of central-European origin. The painted decoration of the part of the building constructed in 1925 shows the same pattern, iconography and style as the older part. Its iconography displays a compilation of motifs based on free quotation from various mythologies and artistic traditions. The symbolism of the decoration, through the motifs of cornucopias, sphinxes, gryphons and, the central one, Mercury, clearly refers to the function of the building, conveying the idea of success, affluence and prosperity. To be singled out in terms of artistic merit is the allegorical bust of Serbia, a work of the sculptor ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá originally intended for the monument to the heroes of the Battle of Kosovo in Kru≈°evac. Set up in the vestibule of the older part of the building, the bust underscores the national character of the establishment. Until the Second World War the interior was adorned with the portraits of all previous governors of the National Bank, oils on canvass painted by Uro≈° Prediƒá. The National Bank building is representative both of contemporary European trends in the style of academism, and of the work of Konstantin Jovanoviƒá, Serbia's best connoisseur of academic architecture. The architect's distinctive interpretation and the institutional importance of the National Bank make this building a remarkable testament to the social aspirations and economic and architectural achievement of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

It has been found in Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Burundi. It was first described by British-Belgian zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1906, based upon a specimen from the Lofubu River. The species name \\"melanostictus\\" is derived from a combination of the Greek melano, meaning black, and the Greek stiktos, meaning punctured or spotted. This refers to the black spotted pattern that occurs on the body of this species.  Description  Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. melanostictus has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin. The head is about of the standard length of the fish. The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. melanostictus, the humeral process is triangular, wide at the base and tapering to a sharp point, with a poorly defined ridge on the bottom edge, and becoming rough on the upper edge. The top edge is slightly concave. The total length of the humoral process is about two thirds of the length of the head. The diameter of the eye is about of the length of the head. The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a narrow membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches. It extends at least as far as the base of the pectoral fin, about as long as the to as long as the body. The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just past the front of the pectoral girdle, about as long as head, and contains seven to eight, long branches, with short secondary branches present. The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about as long as the outer pair, about of the length of the head, with four to five pairs of branches, with secondary branches present. The skin of S. melanostictus lacks the tiny vertical skin folds that are found on most other species of Synodontis found in Lake Tanganyika. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but it is typically a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika. Thin papilla are present all over the head and body, but do not extend onto the fins. The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines. In S. melanostictus, the spine of the dorsal fin is long, about as long as the head, slightly curved, smooth on the front and serrated on the back, and ends with short, black filament. The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays. The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, about as long as the dorsal fin spine, finely serrated on the front and with large serrations on the back. The pectoral spine ends in moderate length, black filament. The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of nine to ten branching rays. The adipose fin does not contain any rays, is long and well developed, and has a convex shape. The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays. The front edge of the pelvic fin is vertically aligned before the back end of the dorsal fin. The anal fin contains three to five unbranched and seven to nine branched rays; it is vertically aligned with the first of the adipose fin. The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, and contains eight rays on the upper lobe, nine rays on the lower lobe. The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla. All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad. This character is used as a method of differentiating between two different but similar species of Syndontis. In S. melanostictus, the toothpad is interrupted, or separated into two distinct groups. On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \\"s-shaped\\" or \\"hooked\\". The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. melanostictus, there are 23 to 36 teeth on the mandible, arranged in a single row. Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the sides of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys are known to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore. S. melanostictus does not have an axillary pore. The back of the fish is grayish to copper brown, and is covered with small, scattered spots that sometimes intersect. The underside is pale. The barbels are white, and the fins have small black spots similar to those on the body. The maximum standard length of known specimens is with a total length of . Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age. Habitat and behavior In the wild, the species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, which has an observed temperature range of , an approximate pH of 8.5 ‚Äì 9, and dH range of 4-15. It inhabits littoral to benthic zones over shell, sand, and mud bottoms, to a maximum depth of . The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond one report that found gravid females containing over 3,000 eggs. Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning. As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes. The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.

Background In 1979, McCormick became an equity partner at the law firm Fasken Martineau. Subsequently, in the 1980s, the equity partners voted to adopt a provision in their Partnership Agreement that required equity partners to retire as equity partners and divest their ownership shares at the end of the year in which they turned 65. A partner could make individual arrangements to continue working as an employee or as a \\"regular\\" (i.e., non-equity) partner, but such arrangements were stated in the Agreement to be the exception rather than the rule. In 2009, when he was 64, McCormick brought a complaint to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal arguing that this provision constituted age discrimination in employment, contrary to s. 13(1) of the province's Human Rights Code. The law firm applied to have the complaint dismissed on the grounds that, as an equity partner, McCormick was not in a workplace relationship covered by the Code.

British Columbia (Ministry of Health Services) (No. 1), 2005 BCHRT 361 concluded that an employment relationship did exist and therefore s. 13(1) applied:SCC, par. 13, summarizing BCHRT, par. 111137 #Fasken \\"utilized\\" Mr. McCormick to provide legal services to the firm's clients and to generate intellectual property. #Fasken exercised control over Mr. McCormick through the direction given by managing partners and client and file managers. #Despite the fact that the partnership involves sharing profits rather than paying fixed wages, the firm nevertheless had the burden of determining and paying Mr. McCormick's compensation. #Allegations that Fasken treated Mr. McCormick differently because of his age engaged the broad remedial purposes of the Code. =British Columbia Supreme Court= Fasken's application for judicial review was dismissed by the British Columbia Supreme Court. In her ruling upholding the Tribunal's decision, Bruce J stated: =British Columbia Court of Appeal= The BCSC ruling was reversed on appeal. In her ruling, Levine JA observed that that ruling misinterpreted certain provisions of the BC Partnership Act,BCCA, par. 3445 and declared: At the Supreme Court of Canada The appeal was dismissed with costs.SCC, par. 49 Abella J, however, began her opinion with this observation: While different lists of factors have been employed by Canadian tribunals and courts to determine whether an employment relationship exists,SCC, par. 1925 \\"the consistent animating themes are control and dependency.\\"SCC, par. 26 In that regard: :* Relying on a formalistic approach to a master and servant relationship resurrects an unduly restrictive traditional test for employment.SCC, par. 21, citing :* The test is who is responsible for determining working conditions and financial benefits and to what extent does a worker have an influential say in those determinations? The more the work life of individuals is controlled, the greater their dependency and, consequently, their economic, social and psychological vulnerability in the workplace.SCC, par. 23, citing Arthurs, as well as and :* The approach taken by the Supreme Court of the United States in similar cases was endorsed.SCC, par. 26, citing Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P. C. v. Wells, In summary, she noted: \\"While the structure and protections normally associated with equity partnerships mean they will rarely be employment relationships for purposes of human rights legislation, this does not mean that form should trump substance.\\"SCC. par. 38 Applying the control/dependency test to McCormick's relationship with Fasken, it was determined that \\"he was part of the group that controlled the partnership, not a person vulnerable to its control.\\"SCC. par. 39 Therefore, the Code did not apply, but it was possible that discrimination claims can be addressed under the provisions of the Partnership Act, under which \\"[o]ne of the duties partners owe each other is the duty of utmost fairness and good faith\\":SCC. par. 47, citing s. 22 of the Act Impact McCormick was seen to be a landmark ruling that gives professional partnerships significant control over their ability to put time limits on their ownership. However, it also introduced a new way to determine whether someone is an employer or an employee. In describing the control/dependency test, the Court gave special mention to the factors listed in the U.S. case Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P. C. v. Wells:EEOC Compliance Manual ¬ß 605: 0009. [pp. 449-50], now found at EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 2: Threshold Issues at 2-III(A)(1)(d) :* Whether the organization can hire or fire the individual or set the rules and regulations of the individual's work :* Whether and, if so, to what extent the organization supervises the individual's work :* Whether the individual reports to someone higher in the organization :* Whether and, if so, to what extent the individual is able to influence the organization :* Whether the parties intended that the individual be an employee, as expressed in written agreements or contracts :* Whether the individual shares in the profits, losses, and liabilities of the organization The result in McCormick was case- specific, in that BC's Code was more restricted in scope compared to other jurisdictions such as Ontario's.e.g., in Ontario, there is a right to contract on equal terms without discrimination under the , acknowledged at BCSC, par. 82 However, the SCC's endorsement of a control/dependency test for determining partnership and employment relationships, together with its obiter observation about partners' duty of \\"utmost fairness and good faith\\" to each other, may encourage expanded litigation in this area. Other commentators have observed that the test can be used to determine whether an employment relationship exists in many different contexts (including independent contractors, shareholders, agents, or others that work for or with others but are not called \\"employees\\"), and non-equity partnerships could be the next battleground in defining their scope. In the same week, the United Kingdom Supreme Court in Clyde & Co LLP v van Winklehof handed down a judgment that dealt with the same question as to whether a person was a \\"worker\\" within the scope of the Employment Rights Act 1996. While the result still revolved around the scope of the Act in question, it serves to remind that the determination of a partner's employment status may differ depending on the specific factual circumstances or applicable legislation. Significantly, the majority ruling concerning statutory interpretation by Lady Hale in Clyde & Co could be adopted in Canadian jurisprudence if minor changes are made to Canadian legislation.

Carniola was a historical region that comprised parts of present-day Slovenia. Which geographically distinguishes this distinguishes this species from its other relative Astrantia bavarica(from Germany). Astrantia carniolica was originally described and published by Franz Xavier von Wulfen in 1778, in Volume 31 of 'Florae Austriacae, sive plantarum selectarum in Austriae archiducatu sponte crescentium, icones, ad vivum coloratae, et descriptionibus, ac synononymis illustratae.' (commonly known as Fl. Austriac. (Jacquin)). It is sometimes known as the 'carnic masterwort', or 'Red Masterwort'. Its Finnish common name is \\"Alppit√§htiputki\\". It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 30 October 1996 and then updated on the 17 June 2008. Astrantia carniolica is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to the south-eastern Alps in Europe. Range It has been found in Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Italy and Slovenia. In Slovenia, it has been found in the Julian Alps and near Bohinj lake. Habitat They are common in mountain grasslands, in forests and clearings and close to the streams, usually on calcareous soils (limey soils), at an altitude of above sea level. Cultivation Astrantia carniolica also has one other cultivar recognised by the RHS. Astrantia carniolica 'rubra', which grows well in the garden, given some shade and moisture. Its flowerhead provides summer colour in shades of red. It is rated for hardiness, USDA zones 5 to 9. Reproduction Astrantia carniolica is an entomophilous plant, mainly pollinated by beetles, but also by other insects. This perennial plant reproduces itself also by means of buds present at the ground level. References Other sources Walter Erhardt, Erich G√∂tz, Nils B√∂deker, Siegmund Seybold: Der gro√üe Zander.

Tbilisi, 1785/6 ‚Äì d. Tehran, 1857), was a eunuch of Armenian origin, who became an influential figure in Qajar Iran.  Biography  Born as a son of a Christian Armenian priest in Tbilisi, Georgia, Khosrow's original name was Andre Ghaytmazeants, and like his father, was a Christian, which he remained until his late-teens, where he converted to Islam and assumed the name \\"Khosrow Khan Gorji\\". Even though the surname \\"Gorji\\" in Persian usually refers to a person of ethnic Georgian origin or descent, this was not the case with Khosrow Khan. During his early life, he participated in the expedition of the Russian general Pavel Tsitsianov against Iran during the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813, as the former was attempting to conquer Irans northern territories. However, he was eventually captured by an Iranian army in 1804 near Yerevan, was castrated, and then became a eunuch of the Qajars. On 23 February 1815, Khosrow was appointed as the governor of Gilan. During his governorship of the province, he ordered the establishment of many buildings, which still survive today in Gilan. He also had good relations with lower classes of the region, but had bad relations with the local rulers of the province. This soon resulted in a revolt in 1819, and Khosrow was shortly deprived of his governorship of the region. Later in 1822/3, Khosrow was sent at the head of an army consisting of Bakhtiaris to conquer Mandalij, a place situated between the Iranian-Ottoman borders. Khosrow successfully managed to conquer the place, and was in 1824, appointed by the Qajar shah Fath-Ali Shah Qajar as the personal vizier of the latters son, Mohammad Mirza Seyf od-Dowleh, who served as the governor of Isfahan, thus succeeding the Georgian nobleman named Yusef Khan-e Gorji. Inside the royal court, Khosrow formed an alliance with Manouchehr Khan Gorji. Fath-Ali Shah later died in 1834, which resulted in a struggle for the Qajar throne between his two sons Ali Mirza and Mohammad Mirza. Khosrow aided Mohammad, who eventually managed to emerge victorious during the struggle, and crowned himself as the new shah of Iran, taking the dynastic name of \\"Mohammad Shah Qajar\\". Khosrow was then appointed as the governor of Isfahan as an award for his aid. On 22 October 1847, Khosrow was appointed as the governor of Kurdistan, thus succeeding Rezaqoli Khan Wali, whom he had arrested and sent to the Iranian capital Tehran. However, his governorship of Kurdistan was briefly, and lasted only one year, the same year which Mohammad Shah died. In 1851/2 Khosrow was appointed as the governor of Qazvin, but instead sent a representative to the province, and stayed during the rest of his life in Tehran, where he died on 27 July 1857.

The site measures 12,000 ha and is located in the district of Brokopondo around 130 km south from the capital city Paramaribo. The 500 meter high Brownsberg is the central point of the park. The site is located near the Brokopondo Reservoir. The park is managed by STINASU. Often the people of Surinam use the word Brownsberg as simple variant of Brownsberg Nature Park. Local people also write it as Bruijnsberg, pronounced as Braynsberg. History The Leo waterfall on the brownsberg in suriname At the end of the 19th century gold miners entered the area now known as Brownsberg Nature Park. One of the first was John Brown after whom both the park as well as the mountain (berg meaning mountain in Dutch) are named. After the miners left there was a failed attempt to mine bauxite. Since 1969 the site has been a nature reserve and has been managed by STINASU. Gold mining is known to have occurred again since 1999. Action against the illegal miners was taken periodically, but high gold prices have led them to return. Geography The geomorphological history of the area led to the current biodiversity of the park. It also left the gold deposits. The Brownsberg, located on the Mazaroni plateau, overlooks the Brokopondo Reservoir. Flora and fauna The park is in the Guianan moist forests ecoregion. It has an estimated 1450 species of plants and 350 species of birds. Amongst the species present are howler monkeys, grey-winged trumpeters, toucans and red-rumped agoutis. Threats In 2012 the World Wide Fund for Nature published a report on the nature park which stated that it was severely threatened by illegal gold mining. The organisation found fifty illegal sites of gold miners in three weeks. The number of illegal gold miners was estimated between 1500 and 2000 in the immediate years preceding 2012 by the head of the committee of Gold Mining Regulation. The number has risen due to higher gold prices. Mercury also attained the soil of the park. Tourism The park receives around 20,000 visitors each year. Near the mountain there are several sleeping accommodations, an information center and restaurant. Starting at the mountain there are several paths leading to waterfalls and other waters.

Eƒüridere acted in Alina, the Turkish Assassin. In an interview with Hurriyet, Bobby Roth said \\"I accepted the project and agreed to shoot in Turkey only because I trusted Seda.\\" In 2014, Eƒüridere made her directorial debut with the wartime drama Seasons of War, a story about a multi-ethnic couple during the Siege of Sarajevo.  Early life and education  Born in Bursa, Turkey, Seda Eƒüridere is the daughter of Ahmet Eƒüridere, a prominent business figure in Bursa, Turkey, and Sadriye Eƒüridere. She is of Bulgarian and Turkish descent. Both of her parents emigrated to Turkey in the 1950s and 1970s. Eƒüridere attended Inal Ertekin Elementary School, the oldest and most successful elementary school in Bursa, Turkey and Bursa Anadolu Lisesi, one of the most prominent high schools in the West Anatolian area of Turkey. Eƒüridere moved to Evansville, Wisconsin, for her senior year of high school as an exchange student and participated in several stage productions at Evansville High School and many community theaters in Wisconsin including American Players Theater. Despite starting to gain recognition as an actress and being accepted to prestigious acting schools, she chose to double-major in Psychology and English Literature at Bogazici University, the highest ranking university in Turkey. During college, she did exchange semesters at Arizona State University where she was one of the founders of the non-profit cultural organization, Bosphorus Art Project. With Bosphorus Art Project, Eƒüridere organized Turkish film days at the Phoenix Film Festival, with the goal of building a bridge between Turkish and American cultures. After graduating from college, Eƒüridere decided to pursue her passion of acting and filmmaking and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. She acted in leading roles in many productions during her time in Los Angeles, including Proof, Closer and The Shape of Things and became one of the most recognized stage actors at the institute. Apart from her work in the entertainment industry, over the years, Eƒüridere continued her career in psychology and published articles in the field of neuropsychology in leading scientific journals.  Acting career  Eƒüridere began her professional career in film in 2010 when she was cast as the title character Alina in the feature film, Alina, the Turkish Assassin. Consulting director/producer for the film was the American director Bobby Roth whose directing credits include Lost, Prison Break, Revenge and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Upon being cast as the titular character, Eƒüridere persuaded director Roth to shoot parts of the film in her home country. The casting process for the male lead actor was diligent and producers had difficulty finding a Turkish actor who spoke good English but finally, in 2012, Turkish actor, Tamer Karadaƒülƒ± was cast to play the male lead opposite Eƒüridere. For the movie, Eƒüridere was required to speak Russian, Spanish and Arabic, undergo extensive martial arts training and learn to ride a motorcycle. She was celebrated for her physical performance and the sex scenes with Tamer Karadaƒülƒ± generated a lot of buzz around the film. Before the production started on Alina, the Turkish Assassin, Eƒüridere appeared in a guest role in 2011, in the award-winning feature film Hicaz, the directorial debut of Erdal Rahmi Hanay. Recently, Eƒüridere started to work on her latest project, an independent feature, Inside Out, for which she wrote the script as well as producing it. She stars in the leading role Azra Yilmaz, a Turkish art curator who moves to Los Angeles to expand her influence in the art gallery scene.  Directing career  In 2014, Eƒüridere started working on her directorial feature debut with Seasons of War, a love story about a multi-ethnic married couple in Sarajevo over the course of 4 years from Spring 1992 to Winter 1995 during the 1992‚Äì95 Bosnian War. Eƒüridere had the idea for the film when she was traveling in the Balkans, doing research on her own family history and their experiences in Bulgaria in the 1950s and 1970s. After visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina and realizing the similarities between her own family's experience and the experiences of local Sarajevans, she wrote the script for Seasons of War with her writing partner Mark Harley. The script was based on true events during the Bosnian War, of which Eƒüridere later said \\"I have a personal connection to the story. I wanted to make a documentary about my family history and I went to Bulgaria to do research. I traveled all of the Balkans. During my trip, I met a woman in Bosnia, who inspired the character of Jelena in the movie. This woman told me her story and it was exactly the same story I heard from my grandparents: a young couple forced to make difficult choices and are discriminated because of their nationalities and religion. It was the same story, yet there was almost half a century in between. At that moment, I realized I had to do the film because same story repeats throughout history; different times, different countries but the story remains the same. I am sure there are Russian-Ukrainian families or many others around the world who are currently going through the same hell. I just had to tell the story and raise awareness to the topic.\\" Eƒüridere cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia, most of whom lived through the war‚Äîincluding stars Adnan Novo and Sanja Popovic‚Äîand incorporated their experiences into her script. Production of the film was delayed due to 2014 Southeast Europe floods. Eƒüridere appealed via her official Twitter and Facebook profiles for donations to help the flood victims and pledged to donate all the funds raised through the film's Indiegogo campaign to aid in flood relief in the region. Before the production of the film started, Eƒüridere was compared to Angelina Jolie and Seasons of War was compared to Jolie's directorial debut In the Land of Blood and Honey, of which Eƒüridere explained that she watched and respected Jolie's work both as a director and a scriptwriter but Seasons of War was a totally different film that followed a totally different story line and that her film was not a war film but was a film simply about a couple and the difficult choices they had to make.

It was released on 11 August 2014 as the third single to promote her third studio album, A Perfect Contradiction (2014). The song was used to promote series 8 of Britain's Got Talent. Inspiration and composition The song, composed by Faith along with experienced songwriters Andrea Martin and Steve Robson, has been described as featuring Faith's standard mix of pop music and jazz along with Motown influences. Faith stated in an interview that the song is inspired by a relationship she was having at the time. In detail, the man she attributes the song to was \\"her best friend, but too close (in a romantic sense)\\" and made her feel \\"like he was dragging my energy out of me\\". By borrowing money and requiring that she give him \\"constant emotional support\\", Faith concluded the man was just increasing the burden of her \\"already stressful life (as a musician)\\", and she wrote the song as an effective \\"message\\" to the man to tell him he was \\"being a bit of a pain\\". Lyrically, Faith expresses these ideas at the start of the song's verses: \\"Well you ask for money...\\" and \\"You got problems with emotion...\\". Omission and postponement This song was originally written with Steve Robson in synchronisation with Faith's sophomore studio album Fall to Grace, but was considered by Faith as \\"inappropriate\\" or \\"misfitting\\" in regards of that album's theme. As a result, the song was saved for a later album, specifically \\"A Perfect Contradiction\\". Music video Following an official audio, and teasers on Faith's Facebook, the official video for the song was released at midnight on 30 June 2014, garnering 17,000 views in 16 hours. As with the two previous videos from the album, the video was directed by Paul Gore of video directing company Somesuch & Co.

In her early career she was an opera singer. She was spotted by the impresario Robert Courtneidge and recruited for his productions in the West End of London and on tour, most notably the hit musical The Arcadians. She was known for the purity of her soprano singing voice. Life and career She was the daughter of Will Smithson, a well-known provincial theatre manager. She was born in Leicester in the heart of England, but was raised in south Wales, where her father owned and ran the Theatre Royal, Merthyr Tydfil. She made her stage debut at the age of three in pantomime. After leaving school she studied at the London College of Music. Various singing engagements followed, and while she was touring with a small opera company in La fille du r√©giment, she was spotted by the impresario Robert Courtneidge. Under his management she toured in 1904‚Äì05 as Nanoya in The Cingalee and Chandra Nil in The Blue Moon. In August 1905 she made her first appearance in the West End repeating her role in The Blue Moon and making an immediate success. From then until the First World War she made occasional variety appearances and played in a series of musical comedies. The latter included The Dairymaids, Tom Jones, The Arcadians (in which she created the role of Sombra), The Mousm√©, The Sleeping Beauty, An Indian Romance and The Sleeping Beauty Re-Awakened. In July 1914, she sailed for Australia, but the outbreak of war curtailed her tour. Returning to England in 1915 she toured in variety theatres and played pantomime seasons in London. Australian and South African tours followed in the 1920s, and she returned to England in 1927. One of her last engagements was in a national tour of The Gipsy Princess. She had a singing voice of great purity, and audiences waited expectantly for her trademark pianissimo high notes. The operatic star Adelina Patti dubbed her \\"the Nightingale of Wales\\".

Early years Jean Joseph Victor G√©nissieu was born in Chabeuil, Dr√¥me, in October 1749. His family originally came from Parnans, near to Romans-sur-Is√®re. His grandfather Cl√©ment G√©nissieu left that village towards the end of the 17th century and established himself as a merchant in Chabeuil. His parents were Joseph G√©nissieux, notary and prosecutor, and Dominique Faure. Jean Joseph Victor G√©nissieu became an advocate with the Grenoble parliament before the Revolution. When the revolution broke out in 1789, he assisted in the assembly of Vizille and organized the \\"People's Society of Grenoble.\\" In 1790 he was named administrator of the Grenoble district and judge of the Grenoble court. Political career In September 1792 G√©nissieu was elected to the National Convention for the department of Is√®re, and became one of the most important members. He was an ardent revolutionary. He did not sit with the Mountain, but was associated with almost all the violent measures of the Convention. On 16 December 1792 he demanded that all members of the royal family be banished, including the Duke of Orleans. On 20 January 1793 he voted for the death of King Louis XVI of France without appeal or reprieve. On 26 March he demanded that all the former nobles be disarmed. On 31 March 1793 G√©nissieu spoke in the Convention in favor of banning performances of Voltaire's play M√©rope. The allusions in the play to a queen in mourning were awkward since Louis XVI had just been executed. On 22 July he voted that a forced loan, voted the month before, be levied only on the capitalists. On 5 July he declared that the priests and nobles who took part in the Vend√©e uprising should be treated as chiefs of brigands. He constantly pressed for the most severe measures against the √©migr√©s. Report to the Council of Five Hundred on 16 Thermidor VI (3 August 1798) After the Thermidorian Reaction of 9 Thermidor II (27 July 1794) G√©nissieu was charged with examining the conduct of the revolutionary tribunal of Brest. He submitted a cold and impartial report on 16 Prairial III (4 June 1795) describing actions that had often been appalling. His reports on the conduct of the deputies Dupin and Chaudron-Rousseau, justly accused of great misdeeds, were equally dispassionate. In a speech on 11 Flor√©al III (30 April 1795) G√©nissieu discussed the dilemma that to make the Committee of Public Safety more efficient by giving it more power would risk a dangerous transfer of authority from the elected convention to the anonymous bureaucracy. G√©nissieu was the author of the law of 28 Thermidor III (15 August 1795) that declared void all revolutionary judgments since 10 March 1793. While maintaining his position on the √©migr√©s, on 18 Fructidor III (4 September 1795) he asked that Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord be removed from the list. Four days later he voted for a law restoring their property to deported priests, but he was the author of a law the next day banning all intransigent priests and the parents of √©migr√©s from public office. He always took the position of someone whose political views did not blind him to the need for justice. However, after having voted for a law that allowed the accused to challenge their judges in some circumstances, he declared that the parents of √©migr√©s could not sit on juries. G√©nissieu was made president of the Convention on 16 Vendemiaire IV (8 October 1795). On 4 Brumaire IV (26 October 1795) he declared that the Convention had completed its mission. G√©nissieu was elected to the Council of Five Hundred for Is√®re. On 17 Niv√¥se IV (6 January 1796) he accepted the post of Minister of Justice. He held office until 3 April 1796, when he was replaced by Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai. He had resigned since he could not achieve his goals. He was appointed French consul in Barcelona. He refused this position and was named deputy commissioner of the Court of Cassation on 14 Germinal IV (23 April 1796). Two years later, the Council of Five Hundred nominated G√©nissieu to the Council of Ancients as a Director, but Jean Baptiste Treilhard was accepted instead. G√©nissieu was reelected to the Council of Five Hundred for the Seine, and was elected president of the Council on 30 Prairial VII (18 June 1799). Last years G√©nissieu was opposed to the coup of 18 Brumaire VIII (9 November 1799) in which Napoleon came to power. He was arrested on 20 Brumaire for having declared Napoleon should be outlawed. He was released after six hours. A few days later he abandoned his principles and accepted the position of a judge in the court of the Seine. He died in Paris on 27 October 1804. A street in Grenoble carries his name. Publications G√©nissieu's publications included: *Au nom du peuple fran√ßais. Proclamation du repr√©sentant du peuple Genissieu, en mission dans les d√©partemens de l'Orne et de la Sarthe, aux patriotes appell√©s √† la d√©fense du d√©partement de la Sarthe. *Rapport fait par G√©nissieu, au nom de la commission charg√©e de pr√©senter les moyens d'√©lever les recettes de l'an 7 au niveau des d√©penses s√©ance du 26 germinal an 7 *Proclamation du repr√©sentant du peuple G√©nissieu, en mission dans les d√©partements de l'Orne et de la Sarthe, aux patriotes appel√©s √† la d√©fense du d√©partement de la Sarthe *France.

It was on the Cowbridge and Aberthaw line.Chapman, C. (1984) The Cowbridge Railway. Oxford Publishing Company. History and Description Ystradowen was initially the only intermediate station between Llantrisant and Cowbridge. The cutting immediately before the station was the heaviest earthwork on the line, at fifteen feet deep, and itself preceded a stiff gradient of 1 in 45. The station as completed consisted of a passing loop, with the single platform on the 'up' line with one small siding which served a stone goods shed to the rear of the platform. The goods shed was a 'dead end' type, with the roadway diagonally opposite the rail approach. This involved the somewhat awkward process of reversing carts up to the loading platform. When the line was inspected in 1864, the inspector disapproved of the location of Ystradowen station, due to the steep gradients, and the fact that a number of slips had been made in the cuttings. The station was subsequently dismantled and re-located to satisfy the Board of Trade, meaning that it was a considerable distance from the village. It was finally opened when passenger services began on 18 September 1865. The station was much-used on market days in Pontypridd. Ystradowen village website Ystradowen station closed in 1951 when passenger services on the branch were withdrawn. The goods facilities lasted until 1960, but the sidings remained for a number of years.

Four editions have been published: in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2018. The 2018 edition builds on the Global Estimates of Modern Slavery, which estimated that 40.3 million people were in some form of slavery on any given day in 2016. The Index provides rankings across three dimensions: * Size of the problem: estimated prevalence in terms of percentage of population and absolute numbers (by country) * Government response: How governments are tackling the problem * Vulnerability: Factors that explain or predict prevalence The Index targets private citizens, non-governmental organisations, businesses and public officials so that they can work to end modern slavery. All data involved are available for download from the website.  Calculation  The 2018 Global Slavery Index includes data on three key variables: the prevalence in each country, vulnerability and government responses. In 2018, the methodology underwent changes and significantly expanded its data sources. The methodology is detailed in the report. In 2017, the inaugural Global Estimates of Modern Slavery were produced by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Walk Free Foundation in partnership with the International Organization for Migration. Acknowledged data gaps in earlier editions, including lack of data on forced sexual exploitation and children in modern slavery were addressed by adopting a combined approach when developing the estimates. This involved drawing on three sources of data: * The survey program was expanded to include 54 surveys covering 48 countries. More than 71,000 people were interviewed and the surveyed countries represent over half of global population. It formed the most extensive survey program on modern slavery ever undertaken. * Administrative data from the International Organization for Migration‚Äôs databases of assisted victims of trafficking * Data derived from validated secondary sources and a systematic review of comments from the International Labour Organization supervisory bodies regarding ILO Conventions on Forced Labor. The 2018 Global Slavery Index uses the data sources and regional and global estimates from the Global Estimates of Modern Slavery. The regional estimates form the starting point for the 2018 national level estimates for 167 countries. Prevalence estimates from the 2018 Global Slavery Index were calculated according to the following process: * Individual and country-level variables that have a significant relationship with forced labour or forced marriage at the individual level were identified. Data for this analysis were taken from Gallup World Poll (GWP) surveys conducted in 2014, 2015 and 2016. * These risk factors were used to build a statistical model that best predicted occurrence of modern slavery at the individual level. * Individual predictions were aggregated into risk scores at the country level. Whereas survey data on forced labour and forced marriage are not available for every country, a broader set of survey data covering variables such as age, gender, marital status and so on was available for 147 countries. Country risk scores were used to estimate country prevalence, based on the extent to which the country risk score deviated from the average regional risk scores. * The number of victims was then estimated by applying the estimated prevalence to population data for each country. To this ‚Äúbase‚Äù estimate, an estimate of state-imposed forced labour was added to determine the final estimated prevalence of all forms of modern slavery. Criticism The Global Slavery Index was criticized for its methodology employed to produce prevalence estimates for the 2013, 2014 and 2016 editions. The 2016 prevalence estimates were based on results of surveys in 25 countries through the Gallup World Poll. Its results were extrapolated to countries with an equivalent risk profile. Measurements of forced sexual exploitation and enslaved children were identified as critical data gaps to address in future estimations. The 2018 Index experienced substantial methodological improvements, including a significant increase in the number of survey data points, and substantial changes to the approach to estimating prevalence in countries without survey data. Researchers Andrew Guth, Robyn Anderson, Kasey Kinnard and Hang Tran claimed that the 2014 Global Slavery Index's methods reveal weaknesses and raised questions about its replicability and validity. They stated that the use of its data can lead to inaccurate policy formulation and that the methods used in the Index are inadequate.Andrew Guth, Robyn Anderson, Kasey Kinnard and Hang Tran, Proper Methodology and Methods of Collecting and Analyzing Slavery Data: An Examination of the Global Slavery Index, in Social Inclusion (open access journal), Vol. 2, No 4 (2014), pp. 14-22, article posted on the Cogitatio website on 17 November 2014: \\"The Global Slavery Index aims to, among other objectives, recognize the forms, size, and scope of slavery worldwide as well as the strengths and weaknesses of individual countries. An analysis of the Index‚Äôs methods exposes significant and critical weaknesses and raises questions into its replicability and validity\\" (summary of the article) - \\"The formation and implementation of sound policy is not possible without sound data. The methodology and methods used in the Index are currently inadequate and therefore the Index cannot be validated or replicated. Furthermore, the publicity given to the Index is leading to the use of this poor data not only by popular culture and reputable magazines and news organizations [...], but also by academic journals and high level policy makers [...], which can lead to inaccurate policy formulation and a compounding of harm [...]\\" (p. 19). The 2014 Global Slavery Index assigned countries for which no data were available the same rate as surveyed countries that were judged to be similar. For example, prevalence rates for Britain were applied to Ireland and Iceland, and those for America to western European nations, including Germany. This extrapolation attracted criticism. Scholar Anne Gallagher said the 2014 Global Slavery Index was based on flawed data. Gallagher writes \\"the basic unit of measurement of ‚Äúmodern slavery‚Äù is flawed: the definition is self-created and, bizarrely, changes from one year to the next.\\" Alexis A. Aronowitz called the Index to be \\"terribly flawed\\" and pointed out that: > \\"The index is based on mix of sources: population surveys in a few > countries; fuzzy estimates by governmental agencies or NGOs; stories in the > media; and local experts.

It has been home to several famous historical personages, including authors Christoph Martin Wieland and Sophie von La Roche, and painter Johann Heinrich Tischbein. It was the traditional home of the Counts of Stadion-Warthausen. It is the subject of an article, The Gardens at Schloss Warthausen and Their Place in German Literature.  History  In 1168, a castle was sold to Friedrich Barbarossa, and passed to the House of Habsburg in 1339. The castle burned down in 1474, and was rebuilt. In 1529, Reichsritter Dr. Hans Schad von Mittelbiberach (1505-1571) received the building from the House of Habsburg, adding new construction to it between 1532 and 1540, enlarging it to a country palace. It was burned again in 1623, during the Thirty Years' War, and rebuilt in the Renaissance style in the 1620s. From 1696 to 1827, Schloss Warthausen was in the possession of the Counts of Stadion. The State of W√ºrttemberg took possession of it and its hereditary rights in 1827. In 1829, it was acquired by . It has been home to many notable historical personages, including Count , Johann Philipp Stadion, Count von Warthausen, Christoph Martin Wieland, Johann Heinrich Tischbein, Sophie von La Roche, and Friedrich Karl von Koenig- Warthausen. Since 1985, the building and its surrounding lands have been owned by Franz Freiherr von Ulm zu Erbach.  Description  The palace is built in the South German Renaissance style. It has Baroque external architecture features. It is located just north of Warthausen, near the river Riss. It dominates the area and the eastern tip of the estate overlooks the Riss valley. The landscape as it had recently been completely redone in English style appears in a plan of 1793 by the gardener Br√ºckner. D. Head, \\"The Gardens at Schloss Warthausen and Their Place in German Literature\\", Garden History, 1976. This new landscape design set a historic new standard for German gardens. The landscaped portion of the entire 120 acre estate consists of about 17 acres. It contains parterres (formal gardens). The remaining land is neatly divided in fields lined by all√©es, some being there still. There are some ornamental ponds and lakes on the estate. The Warthausen Brewery, active from 1632-1970, was located at the foot of the hill. It was a beer supplier for about 400 inns throughout Southern Germany and at tourist attractions. The building is now a nursing home. The estate has been a setting of inspiration for notable writers and poets who were invited to the property from time to time over the years. Wieland, a leading authority of the German Rococo, for example was inspired by the grounds of the estate.

The GPI poker rankings are updated on a weekly basis. Players‚Äô performances are assessed by their finishing positions in poker tournaments occurring over six periods of six months (3 years). The Global Poker Index uses data from the biggest poker database The Hendon Mob, known for collecting results of tournaments around the world and for being the reference in tournament results. They currently host results for over 325,000 poker tournaments. The index is used in famous newspapers along with sports results to communicate poker rankings, both on the online and print version.  History  The Global Poker Index was originally created by Federated Sports + Gaming, along with the Epic Poker League(EPL), with Former World Series Of Poker (WSOP) commissioner Jeffrey Pollack acting as the executive chairman, professional poker player Annie Duke as commissioner, and Matt Savage as the League's tournament director. The GPI was employed to rank players for the EPL and decide which players could take part in the League. On 29 February 2012, when Federated Sports + Gaming announced that they had filed for Bankruptcy, all of the organizations and all the brands were acquired by Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc., at a bankruptcy auction in June 2012. Following this acquisition, Zokay Entertainment and the company's CEO, Alexandre Dreyfus acquired the GPI brand, along with its patent-pending formula, in order to create a single, unified ranking platform covering the live tournament poker world in its entirety.  The GPI ranking system  The GPI tracks players' results for their prior 3 years of play, in qualifying tournaments with 32 or more entrants (specialty events and freerolls are not counted), using a patent-pending formula that takes into account result ages, field difficulties, and field sizes to generate live tournament player rankings. For each qualifying tournament a player finishes in-the-money they receive a GPI score. Those scores fall into one of six time periods, each of which covers a half-year based on the starting date of the tournament. These are called GPI Aging Periods. The sum of the player's largest five (5) scores for each of the two Aging Periods in the most recent year and their four (4) largest scores for the four Aging Periods prior to that is their total GPI score. GPI scores themselves are calculated by multiplying a Buy-in Factor, Finishing Factor, and Aging Factor. The Buy-in Factor is the GPI's measure of relative difficulty, presuming larger buy-ins draw a more skilled field. Its median is calculated by dividing the USD equivalent of a $1,000 buy-in (fee included) by 1,000. This results in a Buy-in Factor of 1.0 for a $1,000 tournament, with Buy-in Factors being larger or smaller than 1.0 depending on whether the buy- in is larger or smaller than $1,000. This calculation uses a logarithmic function. It does so because the incremental increase in the skill set of the field theoretically diminishes as the buy-in amount increases. For example, in the GPI formula the percentage increase of GPI's Buy-In Factor between a $1500 event and an $2000 event is much greater than its percentage increase between $19,500 and a $20,000 buy-in events. Furthermore, all tournaments with a buy- in larger than $20,000 are treated as though the buy-in was only $20,000 and all tournaments with a buy-in smaller than $400 are treated as though the buy- in was $400. The GPI also includes a Finishing Factor, which measures how players perform relative to the rest of the field they compete within in any given poker tournament. This Finishing Factor is calculated initially by dividing the field size by the player's finishing position and is also done using a logarithmic function. Furthermore, for any tournaments with a field size larger than 2,700 players will be treated as though their field was only 2,700. The GPI also employs an Aging Factor to player results. This is a multiplier that gives more points to tournaments based on how recently they were played in order to reward players both for recent success and consistency over time.

It is all the more dangerous because it became an official legal error, introduced into the government of princes by powerful figures.

On June 5, 1973, he was elected as the first Republican mayor of Meridian, the county seat of Lauderdale County in eastern Mississippi. Background Born James Thomas Stuart, Jr, in Pensacola, Florida. He is the son of James Thomas and Joyce A. (Brown) Stuart. Tom was reared in Meridian, Mississippi and in California, while his father served in the United States Navy in World War II. He attended Meridian High School where he was a member of the French club, the chess club, and played on the basketball team for a year. After graduating in 1955, he attended Meridian Junior College and the Florida Institute of Technology, known as Florida Tech, in Melbourne in east Florida. Stuart was affiliated with Rotary International, the Shriners, and the Chamber of Commerce. At the age of thirty-six, Stuart unseated Democratic Mayor Al Key, 4,606 (60 percent) to 3,070 (40 percent).\\"Stuart Wallops Mayor Key\\", The Meridian Star, June 6, 1973, p. 1 Stuart listed his priorities as mayor as: *Openness in municipal government *Repairing streets, *Resolving downtown traffic problems *Raising employee salaries *Developing a system of mass transit. In the fall of 1974, Mayor Stuart greeted some 3,500 expatriate African Americans who returned to their former hometown of Meridian from all over the United States to celebrate \\"Meridian Picnic Day\\", an actual 72-hour homecoming. Some had been away for sixty years; many had left because of segregation, which was dismantled a decade earlier. One woman noted the irony: \\"When I was living here, they didn't even allow us in this park. We couldn't even walk through it. Now they're bending over backwards to be nice to us.\\" Stuart was a friend of another Meridian Republican pioneer, Gil Carmichael, the party's 1972 nominee for the United States Senate against James Eastland and its gubernatorial choice in 1975 opposite Cliff Finch and in 1979 against William F. Winter. During the last years of his life, Stuart had resided in the capital city of Jackson, where he worked with the Jackson Redevelopment Authority to obtain funding for an amphitheater in the city historic district. He was active in beautifying downtown parks and making public facilities accessible to the disabled and the homeless. Carmichael said that he and Stuart had talked about an amphitheater for Meridian as well.

Early life and education Rajendran Raja was born on 14 July 1948 in Guruvayur, India. His mother was a chemist and his father was a geophysicist. After his mother died when he was nine years old, his father remarried and moved the family to Kenya, where Raja's father taught at the University of Nairobi. Raja attended a Kenyan boarding school and Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya. He traveled to England in 1967 to attend the University of Cambridge, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1970. He remained at this institution to pursue his PhD under the direction of John Gordon Rushbrooke and was inducted as a fellow of the University of Cambridge's Trinity College in 1973. He received his PhD in 1975 with a thesis titled Single Pion Production. Career In 1974, Rajendran Raja immigrated to the United States and became a physicist at Fermilab, a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory near Batavia, Illinois specializing in high-energy particle physics. During his forty years at Fermilab, Raja's important contributions to the lab's scientific work included playing a key role in the design of the hermetic DZero detector. He served as head of the top quark analysis group, and the multivariate algorithm he developed was a crucial tool in the discovery of this particle at Fermilab in 1995. During his last years at Fermilab, he served as spokesperson for the Main Injector Particle Production experiment. He also became an advocate of accelerator-driven thorium reactors, which he believed could help solve the world's energy crisis. He contributed more than 300 publications to scientific journals. Raja also fostered cooperation between the U.S. and India in particle physics, starting a program at DZero in the early 1990s that has helped more than ten Indian students earn their PhDs.

It happened from July 2 to July 4 of 2014. Background After the end of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, eastern Ukraine experienced pro-Russian protests. Government buildings that were initially occupied were retaken, but on April 6, the Security Service of Ukraine office in Luhansk was occupied by protesters. On April 29, many other key buildings, such as the Regional State Administration buildings and the prosecutor's office were seized. Pro-Russian separatists soon expanded their control to other cities, and held a referendum on 11 May 2014, which they said showed that 96% of voters backed an independent Luhansk. The border to Luhansk experienced a heavy flow of Russians trying to cross into Ukraine to join the separatists, with many attempts repelled. Fighting On June 2, at 12:30 AM, 100 rebel fighters attacked the border guard base, but the guard exchanged fire and managed to repel the attack. However, the numbers of rebels increased to 400, and according to the border guards, the rebels then went to residential areas, and fired from the tops of nearby apartments. Militants used automatic weapons and RPGs against the border guards. A lone plane was detached to try to support the border guards, who were battling the rebels. According to the border guards, some of the militants were foreign fighters from Russia. Ukrainian fighter jets launched air raids on separatist strongholds in Luhansk itself, to try to support the border guards. At least one airplane was seen flying ahead, and a rocket, fired by the Ukrainian Air Force, exploded at the Luhansk RSA, killing 8‚Äì13 civilians and injuring many others. The Government of Ukraine, denied that they were responsible and claimed it was caused by a misfired rebel portable surface-to-air missile. However, the next day, the OSCE published a report, based on 'limited observation', in which they blamed the explosion on an air-strike. The military admitted conducting over 150 air- strikes during the day in the Luhansk area. Heavy fighting raged on until later on in the day. By the end of the first day, the attack had failed and the Border Guards still remained in control, with 7 of them wounded. On June 3, the situation was calmer, but the rebels continued to lay siege to the base. According to a spokesman for the Border Guards, Cossacks were among the separatists besieging them as well. He also said that no Ukrainian troops were coming to the rescue. Valery Bolotov, the \\"people's governor\\" of Luhansk stated that if the Border Guards did not withdraw by the evening, they would be \\"wiped off the face of the earth.\\" Russia called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. They accused Ukraine of crimes against its own people. On June 4, the Ukrainian troops surrendered. They were authorized to withdraw from the base and were redeployed elsewhere. Pro-Russian separatists captured ammunition from the base, and allowed the remaining the border guards to leave. Separatists took the base, as well as a National Guard base near Luhansk and another border guard base in Sverdlovsk. The National Guard base fell after soldiers there ran out of ammunition, while separatists seized quantities of ammunition and explosives from the Luhansk border guard post.

Under development by American manufacturer US Thrill Rides and Swiss manufacturer Intamin, the attraction will be a Polercoaster model which utilizes an observation tower for its main support structure. The project was originally scheduled for completion by 2016, but a number of delays resulted in the date being pushed back several times. The status of the project became uncertain by 2019, when its main website was taken down and construction had failed to break ground. If completed, Skyscraper would become the tallest roller coaster in the world at over and would feature both the steepest drop and highest inversion. History In 2012, owners of Mango‚Äôs Tropical Caf√© in Orlando selected the Polercoaster design concept pitched by US Thrill Rides to become their flagship attraction at the future-planned Skyplex indoor entertainment complex. After several successful negotiations for land, development of both the roller coaster and Skyplex began. In May 2014, investment for the project was sought, and a website was formed to assist with the endeavor. Documents uncovered by an Orlando news agency revealed that the roller coaster would be located in Central Florida along International Drive at the intersection with Sand Lake Road. Skyscraper was officially announced on June 5, 2014. Construction on the main complex was expected to begin in 2015, with the ride opening in 2016. However, design changes and a lengthy process for obtaining the necessary permits caused several delays in breaking ground, and the timeline was updated to reflect construction on the complex beginning in mid-2017. The addition of virtual reality headsets to Skyscraper was announced in late 2016, and the expected opening date was updated to 2019. By April 2017, portions of the roller coaster's track had been completed by Intamin and were placed in storage, but construction of the complex was still on hold pending permit approval. In January 2019, Skyplex's budget was scaled back from $500 million to $250 million, with plans to retain Skyscraper's original coaster design but include less retail development around the base of the structure. The complex's projected opening date was pushed back further to 2020, with rides opening sometime later. By June 2019, the website promoting the project was taken down, and reports surfaced in 2020 that Universal used a variety of legal tactics to derail the project. There have been no updates from developers since early 2019. Characteristics Designed by US Thrill Rides, the steel track of Skyscraper will be approximately long. Wrapping around the central tower, the roller coaster will feature seven inversions including zero-g rolls and raven turns. When complete, Skyscraper will operate with several small trains. Each train will have two rows that seat four riders each for a total of eight riders per train. The ride is expected to accommodate a theoretical capacity of 1000 riders per hour. Each seat will feature a lap restraint as opposed to over-the-shoulder harnesses to avoid obstructing the view. Records If completed, Skyscraper will break several world records at opening. With a structure exceeding in height, it would break Kingda Ka's height record and become the world's tallest roller coaster. Skyscraper will also have an inversion near the highest point of the ride, breaking Steel Curtain‚Äôs record for the highest inversion in the world, set at Kennywood in 2019. Another planned feature, a 123-degree drop, would give it the steepest drop in the world, exceeding the 121.5-degree drop of TMNT Shellraiser, which opened at Nickelodeon Universe in 2019.

Trifone, Le carte di Battista Frangipane, Heidelberg, Winter, 1998, p. 7).¬´Gran parte della produzione diaristica e memorialistica quattrocentesca di provenienza romana, com'√® generalmente noto agli studiosi di romanesco antico, √® giunta sino a noi in copie tarde e per molti versi, per quel che √® della caratura linguistica, del tutto inattendibili o francamente depistanti [...]. Ancor pi√π utile appare allora questo bel volume di Maurizio Trifone, che pubblica le carte autografe, quasi del tutto inedite, di un ricco mercante e latifondista di Roma, Battista Frangipane, esponente di una delle pi√π antiche famiglie della nobilt√† cittadina [...]. Inutile dire che all'Autore va il nostro plauso per aver ben individuato gli assi portanti e le idiomorfie pertinenti ora al tipo \\"annotazione\\" ora al tipo \\"polizza\\", e per essersi arrischiato peraltro a immettersi in un insidiosissimo solco, quello delle strutture sintattico- testuali-argomentative [...]. Analisi del genere, ci piace ripeterlo, cominciano a far capolino e speriamo possano portare in futuro a stabilire di volta in volta precise architetture testuali. Una parte di merito andr√† naturalmente anche a chi, come Maurizio Trifone, non si √® sottratto all'intento di agevolare il cammino della ricerca in questa direzione¬ª (Massimo Arcangeli, recensione a M.

Maria Silvia Rati, recensione a M. Trifone, Il Devoto-Oli dei Sinonimi e Contrari. Con analoghi, generici, specifici, inversi e gradazioni semantiche, in \\"Studi Linguistici Italiani\\", 2014, vol. XL, fasc. I, pp. 141-144: ¬´Il rischio di considerare indifferenziatamente come sinonimi termini che lo sono soltanto in determinate accezioni si evita del tutto consultando il DOSC (= Il Devoto-Oli dei sinonimi e contrari), che distingue in modo chiaro i diversi significati di un lemma, illustrando ciascuno di essi con una definizione e con un esempio. La presenza di un articolato sistema di marche, che comprende anche nuove etichette di registro, rappresenta un altro punto di forza del DOSC. Ecco, per esempio, come sono presentati i sinonimi di bambino: ‚Äúbimbo, creatura, piccolo, pupo, ragazzino, ingl. baby, [grassottello] bamboccio, [vivace] frugolo, [nei primi mesi di vita] beb√®, lattante, neonato, poppante. SCHERZ marmocchio. SPREG moccioso. ELEV fanciullo. LETT bambolo, fantolino, pargoletto, pargolo, [nei primi mesi di vita] infante. REGION napol. piccirillo. NON COM putto. ARC mammolo‚Äù. Oltre alla presenza di diverse etichette di registro, in questa lista di sinonimi si possono osservare anche altre peculiarit√† del DOSC: prima fra tutte l‚Äôinserimento tra parentesi quadre di indicazioni semantiche accessorie, che rendono pi√π sofisticata l‚Äôoperazione di differenziazione semantica. Si evita cos√¨ al lettore di inferire erroneamente che i sinonimi associati a uno stesso significato siano da ritenersi tra loro intercambiabili (non viene creata, in altre parole, l‚Äôillusione della sinonimia assoluta). Il carattere sintetico delle chiose tra parentesi quadre consente inoltre al DOSC di ottenere un felice equilibrio fra dettaglio di informazioni e asciuttezza della voce, non facile da raggiungere in un dizionario di questo tipo. Scorrendo la lista di sinonimi di bambino riportata sopra, si pu√≤ notare, inoltre, la presenza del napoletano piccirillo, etichettato come REGION napol. Il DOSC, distaccandosi dalla prassi, prevalente nei dizionari, di marcare i geosinonimi solo come region., ne specifica in modo sistematico l‚Äôarea di provenienza. Non diversamente dall‚Äôattenzione riservata alle etichette di registro, anche quella per le marche diatopiche appare quanto mai opportuna, se si considera che in italiano contemporaneo l‚Äôabbassamento del grado di formalit√† determina anche l‚Äôaffioramento di tratti regionali e dialettali, con conseguente difficolt√† nel distinguere il lessico dell‚Äôitaliano da quello dei dialetti. La quota di informazioni utili per l‚Äôutente √® incrementata, nel dizionario, dalla presenza di due contrassegni di modernit√† lessicografica: l‚Äôindicazione delle reggenze, che √® regolarmente fornita, oltre che per i verbi, per gli aggettivi e i sostantivi, spesso trascurati, per questo aspetto, dai dizionari, e l‚Äôampio spazio riservato alle polirematiche, trattate allo stesso modo delle unit√† lessicali singole e inserite frequentemente nelle liste di sinonimi. Alle forme gergali il DOSC riserva una cura particolare. Soprattutto, le voci marcate come GERG sono distinte in base all‚Äôappartenenza ai diversi tipi di gergo: giovanile, della malavita, militare e dei tossicodipendenti. La chiara individuazione della provenienza gergale delle voci pu√≤ essere utile specialmente al lettore giovane: per esempio, la presenza dell‚Äôetichetta giov. avverte dell‚Äôappartenenza della parola a un codice di cui un giovane pu√≤ servirsi legittimamente solo all‚Äôinterno del gruppo dei pari o per particolari esigenze espressive. Una notevole precisione caratterizza anche l‚Äôindicazione degli √†mbiti settoriali. Ad acquistare rilievo non √® solo il numero di etichette utilizzate (185), ma anche il fatto che esse siano applicate, oltre che ai lemmi, ai sinonimi: si ottiene cos√¨ una doppia etichettatura, una per il lemma e una per i sinonimi, che rende evidenti gli eventuali passaggi dalle voci comuni alle voci tecniche e viceversa. Le peculiarit√† segnalate fin qui nel DOSC relativamente ai sinonimi riguardano anche i contrari e gli inversi: dall‚Äôapplicazione delle marche di registro e di settore, alla segnalazione delle reggenze, all‚Äôimportanza attribuita alle polirematiche¬ª.

Saluto in questa nuova edizione, finalmente, un dizionario italiano che indica sistematicamente le reggenze dei verbi, che sono divenute uno dei punti di maggiore incertezza della lingua attuale (basta ascoltare e leggere) e che in assenza di norme sufficientemente generali e razionalizzabili non possono essere affidate alle grammatiche, ma trovano in un dizionario il luogo deputato per la loro trattazione¬ª (Pietro G. Beltrami, La lessicografia italiana a Firenze e l‚ÄôOpera del Vocabolario Italiano, in Firenze e la lingua italiana fra nazione ed Europa, Atti del Convegno di studi, Firenze, 27-28 maggio 2004, a cura di Nicoletta Maraschio, Firenze, Firenze University Press, 2007, pp. 181-188). From 2000 to 2005 he was director of the Language Centre at the Foreigners University of Siena and he held training courses for Italian teachers in many countries around the world. He has created Affresco Italiano, an Italian language course for foreigners in 6 volumes (from A1 to C2 levels).¬´In qualit√† di docente di italiano ho per molto tempo constatato, non senza un pizzico di frustrazione, che rispetto ad altre lingue (come ad esempio il francese), l‚Äôitaliano non disponeva di manuali incentrati in modo esauriente sui singoli livelli descritti dal Portfolio europeo delle lingue. In altri termini, se da tempo esistono manuali di francese orientati alle competenze linguistiche previste dai livelli A1, A2, B1 e B2 (il livello che gli studenti dovrebbero raggiungere alla fine del liceo), ci√≤ non accadeva ancora per l‚Äôitaliano. Ora, ritengo che per lo meno i quattro manuali intitolati Affresco italiano colmino tale lacuna. Infatti, ogni singolo volume permette agli utenti di approfondire specifici contenuti linguisti e comunicativi, morfosintattici, lessicali, fonologici, socioculturali. Gli studenti vengono preparati ai vari livelli mediante attivit√† di ascolto, di lettura, di scrittura, di presa di parola nonch√© di osservazione. Personalmente, sono felice della pubblicazione di questi manuali (e di altri che certamente seguiranno) in quanto si pu√≤ finalmente ‚Äì rispondendo al desiderio dei docenti ‚Äì considerare un po‚Äô meno l‚Äôitaliano come il ‚Äúparente povero‚Äù delle lingue nazionali. Con questo non voglio affermare che un manuale possa capovolgere l‚Äôinsegnamento dell‚Äôitaliano in Svizzera, ma pu√≤ quanto meno agevolare il lavoro di chi si impegna quotidianamente nella promozione della lingua e della cultura italian¬ªa (Donato Sperduto, L‚Äôitaliano ‚Äúin carne e ossa‚Äù, in \\"Babylonia\\", 1, 2008, p. 64).Affresco italiano Since 2006 he is the editor of the magazine ¬´Letterature straniere &¬ª (Foreign Literatures &).Numbers of ¬´Letterature straniere &¬ª published by CarocciNumbers of ¬´Letterature straniere &¬ª published by Aracne Main worksAspetti linguistici della marginalit√† nella periferia romana, Annali dell'Universit√† per stranieri di Perugia (supplemento al n. 18), Guerra Edizioni, Perugia, 1993, pp. 207 *Ordine analogico e retrodatazioni.

The facility, located outside Reno, is owned and operated by Tesla, Inc., and supplies the battery packs for the company's electric vehicles (except for its made-in-China vehicles). The facility is located at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) and employed around 7,000 people at the end of 2018, with a goal of hiring thousands more with a total of nearly 10,000 statewide. Future manufacturing programs may also move to Nevada.https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-says- tesla-moving-hq-181109558.html The factory started limited production of Powerwalls and Powerpacks in the first quarter of 2016 using battery cells produced elsewhere, and began mass production of cells in January 2017. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval estimated that Nevada could enjoy $100 billion in economic benefit over two decades from the construction and operation of the factory. The grand opening event was held on July 29, 2016. Gigafactory 1 is aligned on true north, which was done so that the equipment can be mapped by GPS and solar panels on the roof can be accurately aligned. The factory has also been designed to become entirely energy self-reliant. Tesla intends to power the structure through a combination of on-site solar, wind and geo- thermal sources. When completed, the building will have the largest footprint in the world and second largest volume. According to Elon Musk, one hundred factories like Giga Nevada will be necessary to transition the world to sustainable energy consumption.  History  Initial public mention of the gigafactory concept was made in November 2013, although Tesla's internal plans predated that; Tesla had investigated almost 100 sites. In July 2014, it was announced that Panasonic had reached a basic agreement with Tesla to invest in a factory, estimated to cost $5 billion. The northern Nevada site and plans were announced with state officials on September 3, 2014. Panasonic agreed to lead the battery cell production portion of the manufacturing, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk indicated in 2015 that the total Panasonic investment would be , and that Tesla would not expand beyond original plans. In early 2016 Panasonic president Kazuhiro Tsuga confirmed a planned total investment of about $1.6 billion by the company to equip the factory to full capacity. However, after the number of Model 3 reservations became known in April 2016, Panasonic moved production plans forward and announced a bond sale for $3.86 billion, most of it to be invested in Gigafactory. Elon Musk on a March 2015 tour of the construction of Gigafactory 1 = Factory location = Tesla initially considered several sites, but northern Nevada was not one of them. A manager at Reno‚ÄìTahoe International Airport offered some of its 3,000 available acres at Reno Stead Airport, and persuaded TRIC owner to split the bill for a private jet to fly Tesla people to the area. They tried several times, and Tesla eventually came to TRIC and was pleased by the speed of regulatory work.  State competition and incentives  At least five states competed to attract Gigafactory by offering tax incentives, cash grants and other methods in the hope of future business; California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas, where San Antonio had offered bigger incentives with no sales tax, but did not get the factory. States without sales tax were topping the list of preferred sites.How did Texas lose its bid for Tesla's 'gigafactory'? Archive 2014-09-04 Nevada estimates a tax base of $1.9 billion over 20 years. After sticky negotiations, Tesla chose the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) as the location of the Gigafactory mainly due to speed and a State of Nevada incentive package. Other location reasons were rail access, direct sale ability, and low air humidity to ensure less than 300 ppm humidity in production. The TRIC owners gave the first 1,000 acres to Tesla for free. The incentives include $195 million in transferable tax credits depending on Tesla's investment schedule and job creation, similar to the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant deal and others. Tesla's investments earn them about $10 million in tax credits per quarter,Tesla Gigafactory Quarterly Activity Report (Q1 2016) Diversify NevadaTesla Gigafactory Quarterly Activity Report (Q2 2016) Diversify Nevada and by July 2016 had sold these for $20 million cash. At the end of 2016, Tesla and Panasonic had 477 employees and 5,591 construction workers, mostly Nevada residents, and invested $1.1b earning $59m in tax credits. By 2019, the gigafactory companies (now with 7,700 employees) had invested a combined $4.9 billion dollars ($3b by Tesla, $1.7b by Panasonic, and $100m by H&T; plus some equipment). This qualified the companies for the full tax credit amount of $195 million which were repurposed from other tax credit programs for the filming and insurance industries, keeping Nevada State tax programs neutral. The development surpassed the original 2014 plan for investments and 6,500 employees. Numbers for construction were $2 billion and 17,000 workers. The incentive package also includes 20 years free from sales tax and 10 years free from property tax, depending on Tesla's ability to meet performance expectations (like investing $3.5 billion in Nevada). By 2034, this package could have accumulated to a value of $1.25 billion in missed taxes; the 10th largest in the US. The $725M sales tax abatement was particularly important, as 5 other states charge no sales tax at all, and 34 states (including Arizona and Texas) don't charge sales tax on manufacturing equipment. With a tax base of $1.9 billion and an incentive package of $1.25 billion, the projected end result was calculated as a tax-per-abatement ratio of 1.52.

Size: 9MB in 98 pages For 2014-2018, tax abatements were $240 million. The nearby data centers from Apple Inc. and Switch also received incentives. Nevada estimates the construction impact at $2.4 billion and the economic impact from the project at $100 billion over two decades ($5 billion/year, of which $353-378 million are wages) yielding $57 million in state and local taxes. Some economists said that number was \\"deeply flawed,\\" for instance, it counted every Tesla employee as if they would otherwise have been unemployed and made no allowance for increased government spending to serve the influx of thousands of local residents. The regional impact is estimated to be $3.5 billion per year. Other large companies chose to create activity in the area partly due to Gigafactory. Tesla agreed to pay $7.5M per year for 5 years ($37.5M) to the school system.  Logistics  The 6-mile Nevada State Route 439/USA Parkway was built by TRIC, and connects TRIC to Interstate 80. Since 2004, the TRIC owners had planned to extend SR 439 south to U.S. Route 50. In 2014, Nevada Department of Transportation advanced the otherwise dormant south extension. This improves traffic conditions for the many large logistics centres at TRIC and Gigafactory, bypassing Reno on the way to U.S. Route 50. Tesla plans to ship batteries by rail to its car factory in Fremont. Water is scarce in Nevada, and some of the water for the Gigafactory is piped from a treatment plant in neighboring Washoe County. A water tank is also used (about two Olympic-size swimming pools). TRIC built high-pressure natural gas lines to its sites, but Tesla decided to use electricity and not connect natural gas to Gigafactory. Heat pump technology is used for heating, and a $6.8 million hot water storage tank with 10 million gallons is used to balance heat. In 2014 Navigant estimated 100 MW electricity delivery which could be supplied (on average) by nearby wind turbines and roof solar panels, whereas a former Tesla logistics manager in 2016 estimated 300 MW to produce 35 GWh of battery capacity per year. Tesla installed solar panels on the roof in early 2018, to eventually reach 70 MW from 200,000 solar panels. Tesla works with a mining company to extract lithium to the southeast, at Silver Peak in Esmeralda County. They intend to process the underground brine water industrially over hours rather than the traditional way of letting the water evaporate from ponds over a year. = Construction = Steve Jurvetson on a tour of Tesla Gigafactory 1 Tesla had already started brush clearing Gallery of early construction and grading during the summer of 2014 (prior to official announcement in September; permit date was June 26), with vertical construction reported in January 2015. Tesla and its partners intend to complete the facility by 2018. On March 18, 2016 a group of journalists were allowed to visit the Gigafactory under strict conditions and found that 14% of the final building area had been completed. By April 2016 there were around 600 construction workers. Depending on season and building stage, the number of construction workers has fluctuated between 250 and 1,800. On June 13, 2016, Tesla filed for a $63m expansion into section E on the site. By September 2016, the building had grown to with further areas under construction. the building's footprint is with of usable area across several floors. A combined permit value of $322m was registered in July 2016, and $1.2b in July 2017. Gigafactory and the other large companies affect the local area by increased needs in transportation (SR 439) and housing; house prices increased by 17% in 2015 from half of the peak in the previous 2008 building bubble. Local businesses were wary of building new homes, which is being done mostly by out-of-state companies. ;Design features HVAC equipment is located \\"between the floors rather than on walls and ceilings of a floor.\\" All steel is from the United States. Tesla is its own contractor on the project, learning how to build other factories should they choose so. = Future expansion = On April 30, 2015, Elon Musk announced that the factory heretofore known simply as the Gigafactory was now to be known as Gigafactory 1 as Tesla plans to build more such factories in the future. At the same event, Musk also said that he believed that other companies would build their own similar \\"Gigafactories\\". After receiving $800M of orders ($179M PowerWall, $625M PowerPack) within 1 week of unveiling, Musk estimated that the Gigafactory 1 is not enough to supply demand. In May 2017 at a TED Talk, Elon Musk stated his intention to announce three or four new Gigafactory sites to manufacture both batteries and complete cars. Prior to the building of more gigafactories, Tesla may expand and potentially double the size of Gigafactory 1. In June 2015, Tesla announced it exercised its option to buy of land adjacent to the original Gigafactory site. According to Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson, \\"The purchase gives us the opportunity for future growth.\\" In Tesla's dealings with the state of Nevada expanding the size was always an option should the company choose to do so, said Steve Hill, director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development. \\"Tesla had said that the factory will be up to 10 million square feet [1 million square meters] in one or two stories,\\" Hill said. \\"On the earnings call (in May 2015), Elon said they aren't yet committing to this but that they are considering increasing the size of the gigafactory here by 50 to 100 percent.\\" Early estimates from 2014 projected that the factory would employ approximately 6,500 people by 2022, requiring at least half of them to be Nevadans.  Operations  Tesla owns the land and building, and leases parts of the building to several suppliers. The Gigafactory is operated by a management team under executive Jens Peter Clausen, formerly a LEGO executive, who is VP of Gigafactory at Tesla. By April 2016 Gigafactory had 317 Tesla employees and 52 by Panasonic, most of them from Nevada, and 850 by December 2016. In 2017, 3,249 employees were registered, and by December 2018, 7,000 people worked at GF1, increasing to 7,557 by June 2019, mostly Nevadans. = Production = The factory is intended to gradually provide cradle-to-cradle handling of batteries, from raw material over components to finished products, and recycling old batteries into new. Cells constitute most of the value creation, whereas packing and electronics are minor parts.Canis, Bill. \\"Battery Manufacturing for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles: Policy Issues\\" R41709. Congressional Research Service, April 4, 2013. Quote: \\"It has been estimated that 70% of the value added in making lithium-ion batteries is in making the cells, compared with only 15% in battery assembly and 10% in electrical and mechanical components.\\" Tesla views production as more important than products, and assigns more engineers to developing production equipment than to developing products.  Cell level  Computer generated image comparing 2170 and 18650 cells The battery cells produced at the Gigafactory are the new form factor '2170', jointly designed and engineered by Tesla and Panasonic. They are larger than the 18650 cells used in the Model S and Model X automobiles. While the cells were originally expected to be at least 20 mm in diameter and 70 mm in length, revised specifications for the optimized form factor are by . Tesla thus refers to it as the '21‚Äì70' or '2170' whereas Samsung refer to the size as '21700'. Panasonic was expected to begin cell production in 2016, and continue for at least 10 years. Among the machines spotted at the opening in July 2016 were presses and rollers for cathodes. Gigafactory began mass production of 21700 cells in January 2017. Only Panasonic cells are to be used in the US-made Model 3, and Tesla uses 21-70 format for Model 3 and Powerwall/Powerpack. Panasonic owns some of the cell production equipment in an area not accessible to others. By December 2018, Panasonic operated 11 cell production lines. Some of the lines were temporarily converted from storage (NMC) to vehicle (NCA) to increase supply for the Model 3. Tesla uses Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) lithium cells for stationary storage (Powerwall and Powerpack), and Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxide (NCA) for vehicles. The cell components are then encased in aluminum cans made by Heitkamp & Thumann inside GF1, using 10,000 tons per year. An April 2019 report quoting former and current employees at Panasonic's side of the Gigafactory described how half a million of battery cells per day were scrapped because of production defects related to carelessness, lack of respect for operating procedures, and the overall pressure to increase output. Panasonic delivered three million battery cells daily to Tesla in 2018. At the end of 2019, Panasonic had 3000 US workers and 200 Japanese technicians at Gigafactory 1, quality had improved to increase production to a rate of 30 GWh/year on the same equipment. Panasonic occupies more than half of the factory.  Product level  Cylindrical cell (18650) prior to assembly The basis of the early Tesla products are lithium- ion cells in the 18650 form factor. These cylindrical cells have a diameter of 18 mm and are 65 mm in length, a size used for the batteries of laptops. Cylindrical cells are generally less expensive (costing 190‚Äì200 dollars per kWh as of 2014) than large format cells whose active layers are stacked or folded (approximately 240‚Äì250 dollars per kWh). They are used in Model S and X, and Powerwall 1. In October 2015, Tesla moved the Tesla Powerwall and Powerpack production from its Fremont factory to the Gigafactory. The Tesla Powerwall has been produced in the finished portion since the third quarter of 2015. 2170-cells are transferred on autonomous vehicles from Panasonic to Tesla, where workers and robots assemble cells into packs using bandoliers, cooled by tubes made onsite by Valeo.Secrets of the Superfactories (TV documentary, October 2019) Drive units (motor and gearbox) for Model 3 are made with 90% automation. = Output goals = , the projected capacity of Gigafactory for 2020 was to have been 35 gigawatt-hours per year of cells as well as of battery packs. Production could be equivalent of supplying 500,000 Tesla cars per year. When finished, the factory is planned to produce more lithium ion batteries in a year than were produced in the entire world in 2013. As of May 2019, Gigafactory 1 has achieved a theoretical capacity of 35 gigawatt-hours per year but utilization levels have resulted in a 24 gigawatt- hour output, according to Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga. = Karl Hansen investigations = In August 2018, Karl Hansen, a former member of the company's security team, filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the complaint, he alleges that Tesla suppressed an internal investigation into various criminal activities that occurred at Giga Nevada during his tenure. For one, Hansen alleges that the company refused to inform the DEA and local law enforcement officials about evidence of cocaine and crystal methamphetamine smuggling occurring on factory grounds in connection with a Mexican drug cartel. Hansen also claims in it that the company successfully suppressed his internal investigation into the alleged theft of $37 million worth of raw materials. Following the complaint, Hansen went on to allege that Tesla fired him as an employee and then as a contractor because he was \\"not a Tesla team player.\\" Hansen then cooperated with an FBI investigation after discovering that Tesla was spying on him and a roommate immediately following his expulsion; the investigation was later shut down without explanation following months of work. Hansen detailed his entire story in a three-hour-long interview.

One issue in the lawsuit was NRATV, with a complaint that the content of NRATV has strayed far beyond the NRA's core mission of gun rights, airing segments on immigration and gender identity, among other things.

During this time, tens of thousands have reportedly been arrested, tortured, and held in isolation for months to years without charge or trial. Although the state of emergency was lifted in 2011 at the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, arrests continue. Civil society activists, media workers (including citizen journalists), and medical and humanitarian workers have reportedly been targeted by government forces, pro-government militias, and increasingly by non-state armed groups. 1990s 2000s 2010s In May 2011, President Bashar al-Assad issued amnesty to all political prisoners and on June 21, 2012 declared amnesty for all crimes committed before June 20, according to Syrian State Television. However, in January 2014, an extensive report was released containing evidence smuggled out of the country showing the systematic killing and torture of about 11,000 detainees. According to the Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria, a monitoring group composed of a network of Syrian opposition activists that documents human rights violations committed through the course of the Syrian uprising, there were 37,245 prisoners in Syria as of March 2014. =Detentions by government forces= In March 2011, several hundred protests gathered at the Ministry of the Interior in Damascus. Security forces arrested more than 38 people at the protest including Syrian author Tayeb Tizini, human rights activist Soheir Atasi, and seven relatives of opposition figure Kamal Labwani. In 2014, an anonymous defector from the Syrian military police claims to have smuggled 55,000 digital photographs of 11,000 dead detainees in Syrian prisons. These photographs, alongside testament to their authenticity, were released in a report authored by British lawyers and commissioned by the government of Qatar, which was shown to the United Nations Security Council in April 2014 in efforts by French delegates to have the International Criminal Court investigate the case as crimes against humanity. According to Samantha Power, United States ambassador to the UN, \\"the gruesome images of corpses bearing marks of starvation, strangulation and beatings... indicate that the Assad regime has carried out systematic, widespread and industrial killing.\\" President Assad argues that these claims are allegations without evidence, saying: \\"It‚Äôs funded by Qatar, and they say it‚Äôs an anonymous source. So nothing is clear or proven. The pictures are not clear which person they show. They‚Äôre just pictures of a head, for example, with some skulls. Who said this is done by the government, not by the rebels? Who said this is a Syrian victim, not someone else?\\" Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court and therefore could only be prosecuted in it through a referral by the UN Security Council. However, such a referral is considered unlikely given the veto power of Russia, a strong ally of the Assad government, in the Security Council. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in 2015 that an estimated 200,000 Syrians have been arrested by government forces since the uprising began in 2011, and that nearly 13,000 Syrians, including 108 children, had been tortured to death in the prisons. Rami Abdel-Rahman, head of the Observatory, states that security officials are known to starve detainees to death, deny medicine to those who are ill, and subject them to psychological torture. According to Abdel-Rahman, some of the families of those who were killed under torture have been forced to sign statements that their loved ones were killed by rebel groups. =Abductions by opposition factions= It is alleged that groups in opposition to the government in the Syrian Civil War abducted and detained individuals arbitrarily. According to a brief released by Amnesty International in December 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), an opposition group that controlled significant territory in northern Syria at the time, was responsible for abductions and arbitrary detentions of citizens. AI states that those targeted by ISIS for abduction have included a \\"wide range of individuals, including people suspected of committing ordinary crimes, such as theft or murder, and others accused of committing religiously prohibited acts, such as zina (sex out of wedlock) and alcohol consumption. As well, ISIS forces have targeted local people suspected of organizing protests and opposition to their rule, including community activists and members of local councils set up to provide services to residents following the withdrawal of Syrian government forces, other civil society and media activists, and commanders and members of rival armed groups, including those operating as part of the Free Syrian Army. ISIS was also alleged to have abducted foreign nationals, including journalists, staff of international organizations and religious figures.\\" In December 2013, prominent human rights defender Razan Zeitouneh and three of her colleagues Wael Hamada, Samira Khalil, and Nazem Hammadi were abducted by an unknown armed group, believed to be associated with the Army of Islam, from their office at the Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria in Douma, a city outside of Damascus under the control of a number of armed groups. According to eyewitnesses, in December 2014 in the town of Al Bab near the Turkish border, 50 Syrian civilians who were being held in a makeshift prison by ISIS forces for violation of Sharia law, were killed by airstrikes by United States forces who were targeting ISIS headquarters. Although the United States Central Command confirmed the airstrike, they claim that a review has shown no evidence of civilian casualties. However, civil defense volunteers claim to have removed 50 civilians bodies from the rubble of the building, as well as the bodies of 13 ISIS guards. Release of prisoners In June 2014, 320 prisoners were released from Aleppo Central Prison, according to Syrian state news and confirmed by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Activists state that most of the prisoners released from Aleppo prison had tuberculosis. The release is claimed to come as part of an amnesty granted by President Bashar al-Assad as a celebratory gesture following his re-election on 3 June 2014.

She had six sisters and four brothers. In 1904, she immigrated with her family to Canada. In 1907, she chose to become a maternity nurse. She spent a year working under Dr. Kaufman and various of his colleagues until Dr. Kaufman suggested that she go to train at Mount Sinai Hospital, Cleveland, where she would train as a midwife. Prior to leaving Toronto, she helped establish a free Jewish Dispensary located at Elizabeth Street near Agnes, which is now Dundas Street, with Ida Siegel and her brother Abe Lewis.Dworkin, Dorothy, 1890-1976 - Archeion She was the dispensary's first nurse. In 1909, she received a diploma from the Medical State Board of Ohio. In 1910, Dworkin helped form a Women‚Äôs Auxiliary in Toronto with a group of missionaries, and became its first president. The auxiliary would eventually grow into an orphanage. In 1911, she married Henry Dworkin, a Ukrainian businessman who dealt motor accessories and was the founder of the Toronto Labour Lyceum. In 1917, Henry opened a small variety store with his brother Edward named E&H.; Dworkin Steamship and Bankers.

In 1922, Dworkin helped establish the Toronto Jewish Convalescent and Maternity Hospital after the Toronto General Hospital refused to provide kosher meals and provide for the language needs of its Jewish patients. This institution was later renamed Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto. In 1928, her husband died by being fatally struck down by an automobile. It was estimated that as many as 20,000 people attended his funeral. She took control of his business enterprises and became a leader in Toronto's Jewish community. She served as the secretary of the Jewish Labor Committee in the mid-1930s and was active in the Canadian Jewish Congress, ORT and Pioneer Women. She also sat on a number of boards for Jewish organizations.Parks Canada  Government of Canada celebrates the historical significance of Dorothy Dworkin (1889-1976) Over the years, she also became the honorary president of the Sinais, a member of the Mount Sinai Hospital Board, president of the Continental Steamship Ticket Agents Association, a trustee of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and director of the Labour Lyceum.

Originally a school for girls and women, it now houses apartments upstairs and space for meetings and family gatherings downstairs. History =School of Domestic Arts= Edgewood was established as a School of Domestic Arts in 1886 by Mrs. Eva Simplot. with The 2¬Ω-story, frame structure built on a rock-faced stone foundation was completed in 1910. From 1911 - 1935 nine hundred thirty five women and girls from the area attended classes here. Subjects included sewing, cooking, and home management. The lots on which Edgewood stands were owned by Mr. and Mrs. Simplot and were donated free of encumbrance. Through Mrs. Simplot's efforts and dedication and with the help of a group of local women, the school was built. Community support was evidenced by contributions of money, furnishings, and labor. Dinners, suppers, and ice cream socials were held. Magazine subscriptions were sold, bricks were sold at a cost of one cent each. Windows were purchased at a cost of $12.50  the donor's name was etched in the upper leaded glass pane. After the school opened, expenses were met from tuition, board and room paid by the students and continuing donations from concerned people. Any deficit at the end of the month was paid by Mrs. Simplot from her own personal account. In 1934, Domestic Science was added to the curriculum of the Iowa Falls schools, and it became evident that the \\"Sewing School\\" was no longer needed. Mrs. Simplot made plans for the future use of the building. She died in 1935. Her will left all the property now known as Edgewood to the women and girls of the Iowa Falls community, to be used for charitable, educational, and cultural activities. The building was transformed into a community center. =Community Center= Articles of Incorporation were drawn up and adopted in 1938. The articles were amended in 1961 and again in 1978. The articles provide that a board of directors be elected to care for and supervise the use of the building. These directors are elected at an annual meeting held in July of each year. Currently there are 12 members on the board Through the years improvements have been made as funds became available. The second floor was turned into apartments, and bathrooms were installed. The building was rewired, and the kitchen was modernized. A parking lot, walks, and landscaping were made possible with the sale of some of the lots and the support of the city. More recently, the attic was insulated, and the windows were replaced and reinforced. The original upper panes with donors' names were kept. The social hall and kitchen were air- conditioned, and window air conditioning units were put into each apartment. Current income comes from the rental of the five apartments on the second floor and the public use of the social hall and kitchen at stated rates. The basement is leased free of rent to the Scouts of Iowa Falls. Upkeep and utilities of that area are paid by them. As when Mrs. Simplot lived, income does not always meet expenses. Public support continues to be necessary. The Community Chest and interested citizens annually contribute money and labor. For ten years, the Board Members sponsored an annual ice cream social during the July 4th celebrations, with all profits going to Edgewood. The board appreciates all gifts and support as they work to keep the building and premises in a state of good repair and an asset to the community. Edgewood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

Law enforcement agencies operate according to established police practices and ethical guidelines consistent with community standards in order to maintain public trust while performing their responsibilities. Police ethics and integrity are essential aspects of the law enforcement system that facilitate effective crime control practices. A combination of laws, training, and standards help police officers maintain ethical behavior on duty. Holding a position of authority while also having the means to use force legitimately requires police professionals to adhere to the strictest ethical standards to avoid controversial or corrupt abuses of power. Policing the community often brings ethical situations into consideration that may be, but is not limited to, one of the following circumstances: criminal investigations, procedural justice, racial profiling, early intervention systems, internal affairs, citizen complaints, mediation, recruitment, and use of force. Values Values are the ideas and behaviors that shape ethical ideals. Personal values are things that are important to individuals that are shaped by one's specific upbringing, religious beliefs, cultural background, and personal experiences. Societal values are things that are comprehensively held by a broader number of people, like a community, that align closely to the society's culture and beliefs. Personal values are unique to individuals and thus are not an appropriate basis for professional ethics. Ethics can be defined as a system of moral values that distinguish rules for behavior based on an individual's or groups' ideas of what is good and bad. Police ethics are the rules for behavior that guide law enforcement officials based on what society deems as right and wrong. Ethics remain constant while definitions of right and wrong may change over time, yet what may be considered ethically right or wrong can be different than what is legally considered right and wrong. For police officials, ethical standards further include values such as integrity, courage and allegiance. Code of ethics Law enforcement officials are expected to comply with a code of ethics outlining general guidelines to ethical behavior of police professionals. To be effective, the code of ethics should become part of each officer‚Äôs demeanor and officers should learn to live and think ethically in order to avoid conflicting behaviors. Codes of ethics are used as instructional aids for law enforcement departments to help officers define standards and expectations of behavior. Some countries adopt or draft a national code of ethics that all law enforcement officials are expected to abide by and other countries allow for individual police departments to adopt their own code. For example, the United Kingdom adopted a national code of ethics in April 2014, while in the United States, most police departments adopt the code of ethics (adopted) by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, though they are not required to. The Code of Ethics was developed and written by Captain Gene Muehleisen of San Diego PD as chairman of the Professional Committee of the Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC). The failure by police professionals to act ethically could result in the loss of public trust, jeopardize investigations, or expose agencies or departments to liability issues. =International Association of Chiefs of Police= The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) has over 14,000 members and operates in 68 countries, making it the most universally representative police association. The IACP emphasizes the importance and need of ethics training in law enforcement agencies. The organization developed a subcommittee for ethics training in 1995 that later released multiple recommendations to all of its members. The recommendations include encouraging the adoption and support of a law enforcement oath of honor, providing job-specific ethics training, and constantly reinforcing ethical conduct throughout the agency and during recruitment. Incorporated in the IACP‚Äôs rules is a code of ethics outlining standards of professional conduct. The first five sections of the code of ethics are the basic tenets that all IACP members should uphold. Sections six through fourteen outline ethical standards concerning enforcement procedures. Aspects of police ethics training Police officers routinely face complicated situations that involve strong emotions and volatile circumstances. Ethics training can help prepare officers and police professionals for unpredictable situations and how to react ethically. Training can include ethical guidance such as: *Quickly recognize ethical issue or problem *Identify options and alternatives to address the problem *Make rational and ethical decisions *Promptly respond with actions based on the ethical decisions made to solve the issue or problem *Accept the responsibility of the outcomes in the situation Law enforcement officials must both think and act ethically. A response to any particular situation has two factors, the reaction and action. The reaction is an emotional response and the action refers to how a police professional handles the situation. Ethics training emphasizes the importance of responding with actions that are not just abiding the law but also take motivation into consideration. Actions that involve an officer doing the right thing for the wrong reason is not considered acting ethically. The United States Department of Justice released a report in 2009 titled \\"Building Trust Between the Police and the Citizens They Serve\\" which outlines the ways in which ethical training can help create and maintain trust between a community and the professionals policing it. One aspect of training is having the chief of police establish, exhibit, and promote ethical conduct and fairness both inside and outside the agency. Aside from establishing an ethical culture, ethical training should begin with new police professionals and extend throughout their career until they retire. In the United States The United States has various laws and policies in place, such as the Miranda Rights, that are meant to ensure ethical practices by law enforcement officials. Further measures have been adopted to secure ethical standards in police departments. Such measures include various codes of ethics provided by professional law enforcement associations like the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics, adopted in 1957, and the American Federation of Police, adopted in 1966. The Law Enforcement Code of Ethics was revised in 1989 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The U.S. does not have a national code of ethics, rather individual police departments construct their own code of ethics based upon the basic standards laid out in the law enforcement associations that are then incorporated into an oath of office each member of the department pledges.

Despite extensive anthropological research, efforts made towards studying children‚Äôs learning and development in Indigenous communities of the Americas as its own discipline within Developmental Psychology, has remained rudimentary. However, studies that have been conducted reveal several larger thematic commonalities, which create a paradigm of children‚Äôs learning that is fundamentally consistent across differing cultural communities. Ways of learning A common learning process in Indigenous American communities is characterized as Learning by Observing and Pitching In to everyday family and community activities (LOPI). Learning through observation and pitching in integrate children into their community activities and encourage their participation, so that they become eager to take initiative to collaborate with their community among different tasks independently. The overarching concept of learning by observing and pitching-in can be broken down into smaller theoretical subdivisions which interact and are not mutually exclusive: For one, these communities encourage incorporation of children into ongoing familial and community endeavors. Treating children as legitimate participants who are expected to contribute based on their individual skills and interests, aids their integration as active contributors towards mature processes and activities within their respective communities. Children of the Central Plains Region (Kansas City) hold arts and crafts class projects in 1941 Community endeavors are approached collaboratively as a group. This allows for flexible leadership and fluid coordination with one another to successfully facilitate such activities. With a relatively neutral platform for everyone to be actively engaged, an environment is promoted where learning to blend differing ideas, agendas and pace is necessary and thus, encouraged. This flexible organization also promotes mixed-age socialization while working, such as storytelling and jokes, from which these children build morals and connections. In this way, tasks become anticipated social endeavors, rather than chores.Kramer, K. (2005). Maya children: Helpers at the farm. Harvard University Press. In most Indigenous American communities, communication and learning occurs when all participants view a shared reference to encourage familiarity with the task. Moreover, it incorporates usage of both verbal and nonverbal communication. When explanations are provided, it is coupled with the activity so that it can be a means of further understanding or easier execution of the ongoing/anticipated activity at hand. In addition, narratives and dramatizations are often used as a tool to guide learning and development because it helps contextualize information and ideas in the form of remembered or hypothetical scenarios. Furthermore, narratives in Indigenous American communities serve as a non-confrontational method of guiding children's development. Due to the fact that it is considered impolite and embarrassing to directly single out a child for improper behavior, narratives and dramatizations serve as a subtle way to inform and direct children's learning.Battiste, Marie. (2002) Indigenous Knowledge and Pedagogy in First Nations Education: A Literature Review with Recommendations . Ottawa, Ont.: Indian and Northern Affairs. =Goal of Learning= The goal of learning is about the transformation of participation in which other important skills and information are acquired in the process (i.e. responsibility, consideration, observation, etc.). Learning fosters integration within the community and activates the development of socialization skills. Learning also promotes the aggregation of knowledge of cultural practices and spirituality. For example, the Mazahua fifth- and sixth-grade students shifted their role within the class by making a transformation between being a bystander and actually being considerate enough to contribute without being told to do so. This process of participation greatly influences role switching or role-taking among society in which all participants contribute to the successful completion of a task by watching, observing, and collaborating as well. This allows the students to take on the responsibility to continue their school work even when the teacher was not present for a few days.Paradise, R. (1994). \\"The autonomous behavior of Indigenous students in classroom activities.\\" \\"Education as Cultural Construction 4: 89-94. . =Motivation to participate and learn= Another crucial component of child development deals with the initiative and self-induced motivation of the learners (or children) themselves. Their eagerness to contribute, ability to execute roles, and search for a sense of belonging helps mold them into valued members of both their families and communities alike.Alcal√°, L., Rogoff, B., Mej√≠a-Arauz, R., Coppens, A.D., & Roberts, A.L.D. (2014). Children‚Äôs initiative in contributions to family work in indigenous-heritage and cosmopolitan communities in Mexico. In B. Rogoff, L. Alcala, A.D. Coppens, A. Lopez, O. Ruvalcaba, & K. Silva (Eds). Children learning by observing and pitching-in in their families and communities. Special Issue of Human Development The value placed on ‚Äúshared work‚Äù or help emphasizes how learning and even motivation is related to the way the children participate and contribute to their family and community. One of the motivational factors that contribute to Indigenous children‚Äôs learning stems from ‚Äúinherent motivation‚Äù where the child feels a sense of accomplishment or contentment in helping their family or community because the contribution emphasizes their roles and value in their community. Indigenous children take pride in their contributions to the community. When they contribute to their household, children are able to see the value and importance of their work as it helps maintain their family‚Äôs well being. The children are motivated to observe and learn because they are aware that they are making an important contribution to the family or community; they feel pride and a sense of self-worth as they help provide for their younger siblings, family and community. Through such ‚Äúinherent motivation,‚Äù children are expected to learn community practices in order to become valuable contributors in the community. In addition, an authentic or natural setting could be considered just as important in children‚Äôs learning as a teacher. This is because Indigenous children learn many of their skills from observing their surroundings and participating in activities with their peers and other members of the community. =Keen Attention and Guidance= In some indigenous communities in the Americas, children learn by a means of observing and contributing in everyday life with careful attention. These processes of learning are part of a larger system of Indigenous learning studied by Rogoff and colleagues called Learning through Observing and Pitching In (LOPI). These observations and contributions are guided through community expectations the child learns from a young age.Urrieta, L. (2013). Familia and Comunidad-Based Saberes: Learning in an Indigenous Heritage Community. Anthropology & Education Quarterly, 4(3), pp. 320-335.Correa-Ch√°vez, M., Roberts, A., P√©rez, M. (2011). Cultural Patterns in Children‚Äôs Learning Through Keen Observation and Participation in their Communities. In Janette Benson, editors: Advances in Child Development and Behavior, Vol. 40, Burlington: Academic Press, 2011, pp. 209-241.Rogoff, B. (2014). Learning by observing and pitching in to family and community endeavors: An orientation. Human Development, 57(2-3), pp. 69-81. The children are a part of the community and are respected in their attempts to contribute and subsequently learn that their participation is valued. Children are included in everyday life and work in the community, and assembly line instruction may not be used as a way to educate children in these communities. Zinacantec infants spend approximately 70% of their first eight months strapped to their caregivers backs. These children observe everyday life from the perspective of their caregiver. They are fully integrated into society because of their close physical proximity to their mothers.Le√≥n, L. D. (1998). The Emergent Participant: Interactive Patterns in the Socialization of Tzotzil (Mayan) Infants. Journal of Linguistic Anthropology. 8: 131‚Äì161. doi:10.1525/jlin.1998.8.2.131. Motivation to learn is a product of the learner‚Äôs inclusion into the major activities and prioritized goals of the community. The child feels that they are part of the community and actively try to contribute and learn without structured formal instruction.Coppen, A.D., Alcala, L., Mejia-Arauz, R., & Rogoff, B. (2014). Children‚Äôs Initiative in Family Household Work in Mexico. Human Developments,57(2-3), 116-130. Guidance from community-wide expectations is an important facet of learning through keen attention for Indigenous children. During interactions where children are integrated into family and community contexts, role-switching, a practice in which roles and responsibilities in completing a task are alternated, is common for the less-experienced to learn from the more-experienced.Paradise, R., de Haan, M. (2009). Responsibility and Reciprocity: Social Organization of Mazahua Learning Practices. Anthropology & Education Quarterly, 40(2), pp.187‚Äì204. Requiring keen attention and guidance from those involved, role-switching challenges the observing participant to pay close attention to the actively-contributing participant. When these roles are reversed, the formerly observing-participant will have the opportunity to apply what they just observed. For example, in Nocutzepo communities of Mexico, children learn by observing, listening, and paying close attention to others‚Äô tasks in the kitchen. Mothers indirectly show their child how to shape tortillas with subtle gestures while the child carefully watches and imitates their movements. The mother encourages the child by allowing them to mess up, learn, and continue until she serves the tortillas with the child‚Äôs best at the top of the pile. With the understanding that each member of the community has a responsibility to contribute, more experienced members support learners by providing suggestions for how to fulfill the task at hand while the learner's responsibility is to pay close attention. Keen attention and subtle guidance are present in child development in Indigenous American communities with guidance that focuses on the task and the child‚Äôs participation. Guidance that supports child-centered initiatives include allowing children to take initiative in managing their own attention, using subtle nonverbal cues, and giving children feedback without praise.Paradise, R., Mejia-Arauz, R., Silva, K., Dexter, A., Rogoff, B. (2014). One, Two, Three, Eyes on Me! Adults Attempting Control versus Guiding in Support of Initiative. Human Development 2014; 57, pp. 131-149. These forms of guidance have a focus on collaboration and synchronicity within the community and between individuals. They were observed in the interactions of children with their Mexican-American teachers in a classroom setting. Mexican-American teachers with indigenous-influenced backgrounds facilitate smooth, back-and-forth coordination when working with students and in these interactions, guidance of children‚Äôs attention is not forced. A teacher will focus more on their own understanding of the task they are teaching, use natural intonation, flow of conversation, and non-rhetorical questions with the children to guide, but not control their learning. Different learning cues through guidance from the teacher and keen attention from the child are employed to identify when someone is more able to contribute to the larger group or the community. =Storytelling= The development of children‚Äôs understanding of the world and their community is reflected in the numerous storytelling practices within Indigenous communities. Stories are often employed in order to pass on moral and cultural lessons throughout generations of Indigenous peoples, and are rarely used as a unidirectional transference of knowledge. Rather, narratives and dramatizations contextualize information and children are encouraged to participate and observe storytelling rituals in order to take part in the knowledge exchange between elder and child. The exchange of knowledge is also carried on for generations to come. = Parenting = An illustration of \\"Morning Star\\" from the book \\"Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children\\", by Mabel Powers 1917. In such cultures, community members have nearly as much agency as the child's parents in the child‚Äôs learning. Parents (and other community members) instill indirect support to activities, encouraging autonomy and self-responsibility. Learning and everyday endeavors are not mutually exclusive. Because the children are incrementally eased into taking a bigger part in the community, processes, tasks, and activities are adequately completed with no compromise to quality. Hence, the community is not weary of task risks simply due to the presence and involvement of children. Contrasted with patterns of parent-child engagement in Western communities, it is evident that child learning participation and interaction styles are relative socio- cultural constructs. Factors such as historical context, values, beliefs, and practices must be incorporated in the interpretation of a cultural community and children‚Äôs acquisition of knowledge should not be considered universal.Chavajay, P., & Rogoff, B. (1999). Cultural variation in management of attention by children and their caregivers. Developmental Psychology, 35(4), 1079. Some Indigenous communities pass on knowledge through nonverbal communication, storytelling, teasing and monitoring. All these tools lend to the learning necessary to develop by immersion into the productive activities of the community. Parents are not the only source that children learn from. Siblings tells us that although both first born and later born children learn from a single parent, usually their mother, both children's‚Äô speech patterns differ because the older sibling is now more like a caregiver. In the Chillihuani community, a young boy did not learn the flute from his mother or father but by observing his brother, who learned by observing his father. These traditions continuously are being passed down through generations. =Assessment of learning= The process of assessment includes appraisal of both the learner‚Äôs progress towards mastery, and the success of support being given to the learner. Assessment occurs during a task so that it can strengthen the overall contribution being made. Then, feedback is given of the final product or effort to contribute, where it is either accepted and appreciated by others, or corrected to make future endeavors more productive. Thus, the evaluation process is ongoing and coexists with the task itself, rather than occurring after the task is completed.Rogoff, B., Moore, L., Najafi, B., Dexter, A., Correa-Ch√°vez, M., & Sol√≠s, J. (2007). Children's development of cultural repertoires through participation in everyday routines and practices Chapter 19. Assessment can also be non-verbal through hands-on correction or by performing visual cues to the learner to guide them.Pewewardy, C. (2002).

Since the mid-1910s he was being invited as jury member in contests for academic chairs, held across Spain.Facultad de Derecho de Santiago de Compostela (1915) and c√°tedra de Historia del Derecho de la Universidad de Murcia (1919), Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 73 In the early 1930s he was already a distinguished law academic, known beyond the scientific milieu thanks to his numerous press contributions. Minguij√≥n's juridical career was crowned in 1933, when he was elected as an academic nominee to Tribunal de Garant√≠as Constitucionales, the Spanish constitutional court.Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72 The year marked also his departure from Zaragoza; he had to abandon the university chair as the new job required his presence in Madrid.

In terms of topics, his opus is described by a present-day-scholar as multi- faceted.Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72 It may be roughly divided into 4 groups: jurisprudence, political thought, social sciences and ongoing public issues. His most recognized works are those dealing with history of law. From 1911 to the early 1920s Minguij√≥n published booklets formatted as textbooks for students, completed as a 12-volume series titled Elementos de historia del derecho espa√±ol;Baltar Rodriguez 2014 apart from synthesis and update of earlier works they were heavily based on own research, related in particular to medieval and foral Spanish legislation.Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 74 The series was a basis for a massive monograph, Historia del derecho espa√±ol (1927), the 500-page work which gained Minguij√≥n his name and scientific posture. Re-issued in few editions, until the mid-1950s it served as academic manual for generations of Spanish students.Baltar Rodriguez 2014 Minguij√≥n's works on political thought were formatted mostly as pamphlets and booklets hardly exceeding 100 pages. The best known one, having been also chronologically the first, was La crisis del tradicionalismo en Espa√±a (1914), a lecture of author's understanding of Traditionalism and its role in Spain of the era; it elevated the author to a prominent though controversial position within Carlism. It was followed by Humanismo y nacionalidad (1929), Al servicio de la Tradici√≥n (1930), La crisis de la libertad (1934), La Democracia (1934) and Los apologistas del siglo II (1936), all of them marking an attempt to transform Traditionalist outlook into a modern Christian doctrine.he also father minor works, often focusing on specific individuals like Baltasar Graci√°n, Antonio Maura, Juan Moneva, see e.g. El sentido de la vida en la obras de Graci√°n [in:] Baltasar Graci√°n escritor aragon√©s del s. XVII, Zaragoza 1926 El Debate, 1918 Minguij√≥n's interest in social issues gradually developed into a hybrid in-between the science of sociology and theories of addressing social problems. It was first demonstrated in Las luchas del periodismo (1908), a discussion of social obligations of the press,the work despised subordination of intellectuals to the rule of capital, Jos√© Manuel Gonzalez Torga, Fenomenologia de los confidenciales como modalidad del periodismo [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 1994, p. 452 followed by Hombres e ideas. Estudios sociales (1910), Propiedad y trabajo (1920), La funci√≥n social de la propiedad (1930) and La Propiedad (1935) and combined with numerous articles in specialized reviews.especially Revista Cat√≥lica de las cuestiones sociales; the periodical he contributed to from 1911 to 1930.

Arnold, Cultura del Renacimiento (1928) A numerically dominating group of Minguij√≥n's writings are his press contributions, usually some 800-word commentaries dealing with ongoing public affairs. Far from partisan zeal and styled as impartial essays, within a wide public discourse they gained Minguij√≥n recognition of a pundit. Starting the early 1910s he began to contribute to Catholic dailies across the country.like Heraldo Alaves, El Salmantino, Diario de Valencia, La Gaceta de Tenerife, Diario de Alicante or Diario de Reus However, he was particularly active writing to El Debate and emerged as key commentator of the Madrid daily. As during the Republic years El Debate became a semi-official CEDA mouthpiece, Minguij√≥n, at that time member of the supreme national court, preferred to publish rather in various regional Catholic periodicals.Region, El bien publico, Heraldo de Almeria, El dia de Palencia, Labor, La Gaceta de Tenerife and others During the Civil War and afterwards he did not resume his career of a press pundit. Carlist: minimismo Salvador Minguij√≥n (1911) Political preferences of Minguij√≥n's father are not entirely clear, though he is known to have at least sympathized with Carlism.La Regeneraci√≥n 09.12.69, available here A \\"Salvador Minguij√≥n\\" from Calatayud was noted as signing a loyalist Carlist address in 1886,El Cabecilla 04.12.89, available here but for the first time he can be surely identified assuming public activity in 1897, taking part in local ecclesiastical educational initiatives.La Voz de la Provincia 03.04.97, available here He followed an apparent periodista zeal: in 1908 he took part in a Catholic Asamblea Nacional de Buena Prensa,El D√≠a de Palencia 30.09.08, available here while in the 1910s co-founded and periodically managed socially minded Catholic periodicals, La paz social,D√≠az D√≠az 1995, p. 530, Sergio Fern√°ndez Riquelme, Sociolog√≠a, corporativismo y pol√≠tica social en Espa√±a [PhD thesis Universidad de Murcia], Murcia 2008, p. 214. In 1913 he travelled across Europe to see the nascent Christian- Democratic initiatives first-hand, Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 73 El NoticieroD√≠az D√≠az 1995, p. 530 and El Pilar.La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 14.01.10, available here His Carlist leaning was reinforced at the university; in the early 20th century the Zaragoza Law Faculty was dominated by Jaimistas from the Com√≠n dynasty.Bienvenido Com√≠n Sart√© and Pascual Com√≠n Moya However, he was not noted as active within the Carlist realm until publication of La crisis del tradicionalismo en Espa√±a in 1914.he is not a single time mentioned in a lengthy study on marques de Cerralbo, the most complete recent scholarly history of Carlism between the 1880s and 1910s, see Agust√≠n Fern√°ndez Escudero, El marqu√©s de Cerralbo (1845‚Äì1922): biograf√≠a politica [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012 La crisis claimed that Traditionalist dogma was perfectly valid, though it had to be renewed and its application re-defined; Minguij√≥n viewed it not as a fixed set of principles, but as an adaptive approach to problems of human civilization.Gambra 1959, p. 86 The practical conclusion was that the Carlists should seek alliance with all political forces sharing the same lowest common denominator. He advocated rapprochement with the Integrists, with Lliga Regionalista and with the Mauristas. Indeed, some claim that he subscribed to a \\"modelo maurrasiano\\", a new counter-revolutionary movementFern√°ndez Riquelme 2008, p. 204 exploring parliamentary opportunities to build a confessional, corporative and regional state;Fern√°ndez Riquelme 2008, p. 197 others underline inspiration by the concept of Catholic unity, launched by ACNDP and pursued by its freshly set up daily, El Debate.Orella Mart√≠nez 2012, pp. 106, 115 The alliance implied that the Carlists should soften their approach to Catalanism, up to recognition of separate Catalan legislation and administration,Jacek Bartyzel, Umieraƒá ale powoli, Krak√≥w 2002, , p. 288, Orella Mart√≠nez 2012, p. 123 and park their dynastical claims.Bartyzel 2002, p. 288 Some scholars consider Minguij√≥n's strategy a reference to Sexenio Democr√°tico, when Carlism served as agglutinatory factor for conservative forces;Jordi Canal, El carlismo, Madrid 2000, , p. 267 it was supposed to lay path for peaceful transformation of liberal monarchy into a traditionalist one.Juan Ram√≥n de Andr√©s Mart√≠n, El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambici√≥n pol√≠tica, Madrid 2000, , p. 83 The strategy presented was dubbed \\"minimismo\\"Canal 2000, p. 267, Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, pp. 83, 247, 248 or \\"minimismo tradicionalista\\".Jos√© Andr√©s Gallego, Ant√≥n M. Pazos (eds.), Archivo Gom√°: Febrero de 1937, Madrid 2001, , p. 353 Don Jaime, 1910s Within Carlism Minguij√≥n's proposal was appreciated as an elaborated and genuine attempt to revitalize the movement, though the critics pointed out that it would be another version of Pidalismo,Bartyzel 2002, p. 288 an opportunist amalgamation of Traditionalism within a broad conservative spectrum. They lambasted it as \\"reducci√≥n grave y transcendental de las bases m√°s esenciales de nuestra Comuni√≥n\\"opinion of Mariano Fortuny, quoted after Canal 2000, p. 268, see also Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 83 and amputation of Carlism.Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 83 Skeptics offered a competitive diagnosis, namely that the crisis of Carlism was caused by the deadly virus of parliamentarism.Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 84 Following a period of hesitation, in 1915 Minimismo was eventually disavowed by the claimant Don Jaime, who confirmed intransigence on dynastical issues and permitted at best neutral approach towards moderate Catalanism of La Lliga.Bartyzel 2002, p. 288; opposite view in Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 84, namely that Don Jaime himself reduced dynastic thread to secondary position Mellismo and Partido Social Popular Juan V√°zquez de Mella In the 1910s Carlism was dominated by a conflict between the claimant and the key party theorist, Juan V√°zquez de Mella. At a first glance Minimismo and Mellismo seemed alike: both favored parking dynastical issues and forging a grand, Traditionalism-centred Right-wing alliance. However, scholars differ when discussing mutual position of the two concepts. Some name Minguij√≥n a key protagonist of \\"sector promellista\\", highlighting their shared penchant for a conservative bloc;Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 83 others note rather that Minguij√≥n followed de Mella by firmly incorporating the social dimension into the doctrine.Fern√°ndez Riquelme 2008, p. 197 Some students, however, suggest that Minguij√≥n opposed \\"catastrofismo mellista\\" by working towards a constructive solution.Canal 2000, p. 267 They highlight that Minguij√≥n seemed inclined towards politics within the Alfonsist framework,e.g. when courted by Angel Ossorio y Gallardo in 1914 while de Mella adopted a decisively anti-system stance with no dynastical commitments.Fern√°ndez Riquelme 2008, p. 337 One more difference was that unlike a fiercely Germanophile de Mella, during the Great War Minguij√≥n adopted a pro-Entente stand and even considered setting up a pro-French daily.Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, pp. 127‚Äì8 When the crisis climaxed in 1919 and the Mellistas broke away to build their own grouping, Minguij√≥n maintained loyalty to Don Jaime. According to some sources he remained influential enough to enforce ‚Äì together with Francisco Melgar ‚Äì resignation of Pascual Com√≠n y Moya from the temporary Carlist leadership. However, his days in the movement were already numbered. Together with a group of socially- minded Zaragoza scholars he had been co-operating with for more than a decade, especially Severino Aznar and Inocencio Jim√©nez,though periodically also with Maximiliano Arboleya, Jos√© Calvo Sotelo or Reig Genov√©s in 1919 he co-founded Grupo de Democrac√≠a Cristiana, an organization under the auspices of cardinal Guiasola.Fern√°ndez Riquelme 2008, pp. 218‚Äì9, Orella Mart√≠nez 2012, p. 190 Though technically it did not constitute a breach of loyalty towards the Carlist king, Minguij√≥n concluded that Carlism was no longer offering a viable solution. He confirmed his commitment to Traditionalist values, but in terms of political strategy he perceived Carlism a dead-end street: Don Jaime was deprived of descendants and acting as a party leader rather than as a king,Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 204 while the movement trapped in dynastical intransigence was deprived of any allies.Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, pp. 202‚Äì3 Determined to seek broad partnership on minimalist basis, Minguij√≥n left Jaimismo in 1920.Canal 2000, p. 279, Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 202 Severino Aznar In 1922 Minguij√≥n co-issuedwith Inocencio Jimenez and conde de Valldellano, Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 231 a manifesto launching Partido Social Popular;Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, pp. 232‚Äì2 he was among the Zaragoza socially- minded theorists,dubbed \\"grupo coordinador de Zaragoza\\", including also Inocencio Jimenez and Genaro Poza, Fern√°ndez Riquelme 2008, p. 221, Alares L√≥pez 2013, p. 20.

The organization, intended as agglutinatory force beyond a future broad right-wing platform, proved to have been just en episode; like all other political parties it was dissolved by the Primo de Rivera dictatorship in 1923.Baltar Rodriguez 2014 Dictatorship Primo with the Aragon Somat√©n Shortly after the March on Rome Minguij√≥n defined Fascism as a sane response to social disunity and administrative chaos, the problems haunting Spain as well; though he refrained from endorsing violence and dictatorship, Minguij√≥n noted that also in his country \\"tenemos necesidad de depuraci√≥n y de disciplina\\".El D√≠a de Palencia 02.06.23, available here Upon the advent of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship two months later he greeted the developments with cautious optimism;El Debate 26.09.23, available here by the end of 1923 the pesepistas voiced their support for renewal and \\"reconstituci√≥n\\" of political setting. Underlining no support for violence, they hoped for increased social work, making vague references to agrarian reform, syndical liberties, cheap credit, municipal self-government and advanced labor legislation.El Debate 29.12.23, available here Many former PSP members, most notably V√≠ctor Pradera, emerged as key theorists behind the primoderiverista regime; however, Minguij√≥n was not visible in the front row of its supporters. He focused mostly on quasi-political work adhering to the Christian-Democratic format, at that time championed mostly by Asociaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Nacional de Propagandistas. In 1923‚Äì1926 he engaged in C√≠rculo de Estudios, a think-tank born out of ACNDP,Orella Mart√≠nez 2012, p. 300 giving lectures on social and political issues as well as publishing articles in specialized reviews. Many of them focused on his favorite topic, the question of property, advancing a thesis that increasing ownership among wide social strata was the best strategy for confronting both poverty and revolution.Orella Mart√≠nez 2012, p. 309 In 1926 he engaged in building Organizaci√≥n Corporativa Nacional, the nationwide labor organization, by scholars counted among representatives of \\"tradicionalismo mellista\\".Fern√°ndez Riquelme 2008, p. 279 In the late 1920s Minguij√≥n was active discussing structure and composition of the new state diet. Acknowledging that the freshly formed Asamblea Consultiva was merely a stepping stone towards the ultimate Asamblea Nacional, he fully agreed with its corporative format, in line with the theory of organic democracy. Engaging in polemics with other theorists like Ossorio y Gallardo he rather discussed components of the parliament, advocating slightly larger granularity of its structure.Mariano Garc√≠a Canales, La teor√≠a de la representaci√≥n en la Espa√±a del siglo XX: (de la crisis de la restauraci√≥n a 1936), Madrid 1977, , p. 101 Himself he did not emerge as major Uni√≥n Patri√≥tica officialit is known only that he closely co- operated with UP, Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 73 and was not appointed to the quasi-parliament; it is not clear whether, except relations with Pradera, he had access to Primo or any of key decision-makers of the regime. Tone of Minguij√≥n's editorials, though never enthusiastic, cooled down over time; those from the late 1920s and 1930 are increasingly escapist. They discuss foreign policy, history, ideas, law, great personalities etc., but tend to evade current issues.

In the spring of 1931 his press commentaries maintained an abstract, Aesopian language.e.g. on May 7, 1931, in one of his very first commentaries after the fall of the monarchy, Minguij√≥n discussed a manifesto of Liga de Uni√≥n Latina in Paris, see Las Provincias 07.05.31, available here In the months and years to come Minguij√≥n assumed a more specific stance; though he declared himself a monarchist (with increasingly Alfonsist penchant),Labor 29.08.35, available here at the same time he advocated constructive work under the republican regime.Labor 07.03.35, available here His focus was invariably on social issues and the question of property.he compared agrarian reform to building a railway line across private property: you have to sacrifice individual good for common good; Labor 15.04.35, available here Lambasting elitism\\"¬øEs que la nobleza exist√≠a verdaderamente entre nosotros ? ¬øEs que desempe√±aba una verdadera funci√≥n social de direcci√≥n, de gu√≠a, de patronato?

Gaining seat in Tribunal suspended Minguij√≥n's university career, enforced his transfer from Zaragoza to Madrid and reduced his activity as a press pundit, though he continued sending commentaries to various periodicals. As constitutional judge Minguij√≥n found himself in an awkward position; the body was entrusted with safeguarding the juridical republican system, while at the same time he was growing increasingly disillusioned with legal order of the Republic. His struggle was reflected in a highly contested vote on the Catalan Leases Act, known as Llei de Contractes de Conreu. The verdict was possibly the key pronouncement of the Tribunal durcing Minguij√≥n's tenure and pertained to two issues: Catalan autonomy and the social question, the latter related to vineyard tenants‚Äô status. The Tribunal, at that time dominated by conservatively minded judges, decided against the claims of the Catalans and the tenants; Minguij√≥n did not share that opinion and recorded a votum separatum.Joaquim de Camps i Arboix, El parlament de Catalunya, (1932‚Äì1936), Barcelona 1976, , p. 146, Crist√≥bal Robles, Crist√≥bal Robles Mu√±oz, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Urquijo e Ybarra: opini√≥n, religi√≥n y poder, Madrid 1997, , p 577; for Minguij√≥n's view as justified to the public see La Gaceta de Tenerife 22.07.34, available here Civil War Carlist standard The July 1936 coup caught Minguij√≥n during a summer break in Zaragoza.

Historia inmediata, cr√≠tica y perspectivas, vol. 1: Sociolog√≠a, Madrid 1992, , p. 58 Due to his age and health, these activities declined sharply in the early 1950s; his last identified lecture in Real Academia took place in 1951ABC 07.11.51, available here and his engagement in Instituto Balmes became loose after 1953.Alares L√≥pez 2013, p. 267 and onwards During Francoism Minguij√≥n did not resume his longtime career of a press pundit, limiting himself to scientific and semi-scientific articles in specialized or Catholic reviews.e.g. Criterio, see ABC 15.06.48, available here Little is known about his personal views on the developing Francoist system. In the press he was quoted as pursuing his interest in social question and praising social institutions of the Nationalist Spain, especially Instituto Nacional de Previsi√≥n, for their efficiency, at least compared to the Republican efforts.ABC 01.10.41, available here He admitted Traditionalist outlook,Gambra 1959, p. 86 though he is not recorded as active in any Carlist branch of the time.see e.g. Manuel Martorell P√©rez, La continuidad ideol√≥gica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia], Valencia 2009 He was recollected as skeptical ‚Äì also in private ‚Äì about both democracy and capitalism, deemed anonymous and amorphous forces which should be confronted by \\"localismo cultural\\", based on tradition and ‚Äì inevitably ‚Äì small property.Gambra 1959, pp. 86‚Äì7 Shortly before death Minguij√≥n was described as a lonely old man, visited by a handful of disciples and few lifelong friends, like Severino Aznar; on the other hand, he remained perfectly lucid, serene, humble, as usual slightly ironic and far from any emphasis. Waking up around mid-day and working late into night, he was busy writing a treaty tailored as popularization of great philosophical concepts; it was supposed to amalgamate them within a new vision, intended for the future.\\"vulgarizaci√≥n de las grandes concepciones f√≠sicas y filos√≥ficas del presente, tomadas en aquel punto en que coinciden y se completan para darnos una visi√≥n nueva del mundo en que vivimos.

It remains striking, however, that he was not invited to Real Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislaci√≥n. After Minguij√≥n's death a street in Zaragoza and a college in his native Calatayud were named after him; in both cases the naming survived purges related to anti-Francoist backlash of the late 20th century and implementation of Ley de Memoria Hist√≥rica of 2007.e.g. in an article discussing health care infrastructure in Zaragoza Minguij√≥n is referred to as a Christian-Democrat, not a Carlist or a Francoist, see Isabel Delm√°s Gracia, Enfermeria y planificacion familiar en Aragon en el franquismo y transicion [MA thesis], Zaragoza 2014, p. 27 None of his works has been re-published and the institutions he co-founded, Instituto Balmes and Colegio de Arag√≥n, ceased to exist as separate units. In public discourse he was gradually falling into oblivion; since 1959 up to date the popular Madrid daily ABC mentioned him 7 times, in all cases briefly noting his name when discussing Christian- Democratic, Traditionalist or social thought;compare hemeroteca of ABC, available here a contemporary scholar declared him a \\"completely forgotten figure\\".Manuelle Peloille, Notas sobre la recepcion de la recepci√≥n de la revoluci√≥n rusa en Espa√±a, p. 4, available here Currently he is acknowledged only in major general encyclopedias, covered in very brief notes as \\"historiador del derecho\\", member of the high Tribunal and \\"periodista\\".Minguij√≥n Adr√≠an, Salvador [in:] Gran Enciclopedia de Espa√±a, vol. 14, Zaragoza 1999, , p. 6537 In specialized almanacs and reference dictionaries he appears as a scholar in philosophy.D√≠az D√≠az 1995, pp. 529‚Äì531 Minguij√≥n has earned no monograph so far.

Penarth Dock and Harbour station opened in 1878. The name was changed to Penarth Dock in 1928. The station was staffed and had two platforms with substantial buildings, linked by a footbridge. Despite this, it was very quiet during the day, and received almost all its revenue from morning and evening rush hour trains. It was closed on Sundays.  Closure  The station closed in January 1962. Most of the buildings are still present, and have been used by a range of businesses, including a shooting range, a garden centre, a second-hand car lot and a marine chandlers.

It explores a son's gradual realization that his father is far from perfect, and also conveys a message hostile to global capitalism. Production El mejor pap√° del mundo was a black and white Lumiton film directed by Francisco M√∫gica and written by Sixto Pondal R√≠os. It starred El√≠as Isaac Alippi, √Ångel Maga√±a and Nuri Monts√©. The film was released on 14 March 1941. Synopsis The film depicts the changing relationship between a prestigious lawyer (El√≠as Isaac Alippi) and his young son (√Ångel Maga√±a). The son, recently graduated from college and planning to follow in his father's footsteps, gradually discovers the large gap between his idealized image of his father and the reality. The father, who represents an international firm, is involved in a complex web of interests that places his professional ethics in doubt. The film conveys the view that the interests of international monopolies and the Argentine oligarchy are counter to the national interest. The film is interesting in giving a view of life in high society in Argentina of that time. Reception Manrupe and Portela described the film as simple and sobering, with an early anti-imperialist message, and noted that it drew on Mario Soffici's earlier film Kil√≥metro 111 for a boardroom scene. La Ma√±ana de Montevideo described it as fast-paced and interesting, always nuanced, with fine comic and emotional notes.

It has been ordered by Sonoma‚ÄìMarin Area Rail Transit (SMART) in Sonoma and Marin Counties, California, and by Metrolinx for the Union Pearson Express airport link in Toronto, Ontario. Design Each Nippon Sharyo DMU is powered by one Cummins QSK19-R diesel engine with hydraulic transmission and regenerative braking, and meets US EPA Tier 4 emission standards. Structurally each DMU is FRA Tier 1 compliant with crash energy management features, making it capable of operating on the same line with standard North American freight trains without the need of special waivers. Braking energy is converted into electricity by the auxiliary power generator, and helps to provide on-board lighting and heating. The DMU is offered in three variants that shared the same mechanical design: *A-car: one aerodynamic gangway-less end with full-width cab, one flat non-cab end with gangway, equipped with one ADA-compliant bathroom *B-car: similar to A-car but with service bar instead of bathroom *C-car: similar to A-car but the aerodynamic end was replaced with a flat end with gangway and cab, so it can be run either as a middle car or an end car of a train The vehicles are designed to be convertible to electric multiple unit operation. Operators Nippon Sharyo DMU of SMART =Sonoma Marin Area Rail Transit= Sonoma‚ÄìMarin Area Rail Transit (SMART) ordered 14 cars in December 2010. Half of the cars were ordered as A-car and the remaining as B-car. In June 2015 SMART received a grant from California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) to purchase 3 C-cars. These would have allowed SMART to use 3 train sets with a third car in the middle. In April 2016, SMART's general manager negotiated with CalSTA and Nippon Sharyo to adjust the order so SMART will receive 2 more full train sets bringing their fleet size to the required 9 (18 cars) needed for service to Cloverdale.\\"SMART Board of Directors Packet April 6th 2016.\\" N.p., n.d. Web. <http://www2.sonomamarintrain.org/userfiles/file/SMART_Board_of_Directors_Packet_04.06.2016.pdf>. The first cars, numbered 101 and 102, were delivered to SMART in April 2015. The final cars from the original order, numbered 113 and 114, arrived in December 2015. The four additional cars, numbered 115 through 118 and assembled in Japan, were delivered to SMART in October 2018. =Union Pearson Express= A UP Express Nippon Sharyo two-car DMU in service Seven trains comprise the fleet of Union Pearson Express (UP Express), grouped into 4 three-car and 3 two-car train sets (for a total of 18 cars). Union Pearson Express units feature enclosed overhead luggage bins as required by Transport Canada, and an enhanced enclosed luggage tower. The first cars were delivered to UP Express in August 2014. All 18 cars ordered (12 A-car & 6 C-car) were delivered and entered service by June 2015. =Proposed = TriMet considered ordering a two-car train for its Westside Express Service to supplement its fleet of Colorado Railcar DMUs. MBTA also purchased an 18-car option from SMART for its proposed Indigo Line service. Incidents and accidents A July 2016 fire aboard one of UP Express's units revealed a design flaw in the Cummins engine's crankshaft that would severely shorten engine life if not corrected. While Cummins advised that correcting the design flaw could be deferred until engines' mid-life overhaul, SMART chose to have the crankshaft replaced before the service start, as it was also facing delays caused by grade-crossing warning issue and PTC certification. All SMART units had the crankshaft issue correct before the service started in spring 2017. In November 2018, four cars were damaged during shipping in a freight collision while en route to SMART. The agency did not accept the cars as delivered, and Nippon Sharyo dispatched a team to California to assess the damage and plan for repairs.

Accessed April 17, 2019. Architectural historian Stephen Fox characterized Barnstone's approach as one committed to personal vision, free inquiry, and delight over orthodoxy or conventional wisdom, resulting in diverse buildings that combined proportional grace with wit and charm, and diminutive scale with spatial expansiveness. Early life Howard Barnstone was born on March 27, 1923 to Robert C. and Dora (Lempert) Barnstone in Auburn, Maine. He grew up in Maine and New York City. He attended Amherst College before graduating from Yale in 1844. Career Barnstone served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. He arrived in Houston in 1948. Architecture writers identify Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Charles Eames as influences on the houses Barnstone and Bolton designed, such as the Lawrence Blum (1954), Gordon (1955), Moustier (1956) and Winterbotham (I960) structures; they have been described externally as geometrically precise, surely proportioned \\"structural cages,\\" whose idiosyncratic internal plans contrasted open, glass-walled spaces with intimate, compact enclosures.

The responsible body that set the museum up in 1997 and has run it since then is the Local History and Museum Society of the Brushmakers' Workshop, Ramber (Heimat- und Museumsverein des B√ºrstenmacherhandwerks Ramberg e. V.).  Geography  Ramberg is part of the collective municipality of Annweiler am Trifels in the county of S√ºdliche Weinstra√üe. The specialist museum in the village centre west of the high street (Hauptstra√üe), the Landesstra√üe 506, is housed in an old brush factory that, following a major strike in 1907 was formed on a co-operative basis.  History  Figure of a Ramberg brush merchantSince the 18th century, the municipality of Ramberg has been known beyond the boundaries of the Palatinate region for its brushmakers and brush merchants; for a long time these were almost the only occupations that were undertaken in this remote corner of the Palatinate Forest. Initially brushmaking was a cottage industry with brushes and brooms, scrubbers and similar everyday articles made painstakingly by hand in the home, it later became a factory-based activity. For example, in 1907 there were eight brush and brushwood factories in Ramberg. The raw materials, especially wood and Common Broom, were obtained inter alia from the Holpertal valley, which begins just northeast of Ramberg. The Ramberg brush merchants sold their wares not just across the whole of Germany, but also in other European countries.  Museum  The museum offers insights into the occupations of the brushmakers and brush merchants. With the aid of diverse exhibits it portrays the industrial and social development in Ramberg from about 1800 to the time around 1970. Guided tours by experts inform the visitor about the history, manufacture and marketing of brooms and brushes. On view are, for example, technical implements used in brush production, a range of still working machines and the live-size figure of a Ramberg brush merchant in his original dress and equipment. In addition there is an overview of family life in Ramberg from 1780 to 1960.

Doe was a cofounder, with Emmanuel Bombande, of the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP), based in Accra, Ghana. This organization focuses on collaborative approaches to conflict prevention and was founded in 1998 in response to the civil wars taking place in West Africa. The organization is known for their work with several regional partners such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union‚Äôs Economic, Social, and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC).  Early life and education  Samuel Gbaydee Doe (no relation to former Liberian President Sam Doe) was born in Sierra Leone in November 1966, and lived there for 6 years prior to moving to Liberia. He attended the University of Liberia in Monrovia intending to pursue a career in banking. While he was pursuing his Bachelor of Science degree in Economics in 1989 the First Liberian Civil War broke out. Following months of starvation and first hand experiences of the horrors of war on children, Doe decided to put his energies toward ending the conflict. In October 1990, in the midst of the Liberian civil war, Doe worked with the Catholic Church to establish the Archdiocesan Counseling Program a psychological trauma counseling program under Archbishop Michael Kpakala Francis to help reintegrate former child soldiers. He also worked with the Christian Health Association of Liberia (CHAL), and Centre for the Study of War Trauma and Children at AME Zion University in Monrovia. He followed that to work with CHAL to establish a peer mediation program known in Liberia as the Student Palava Management Programme.http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/liberia-2.pdf In 1995 Doe was a Caux Scholar at a center run by Initiatives of Change in Caux, Switzerland. He then served as an intern there and was appointed to a faculty position in 1997 until 2006 when he resigned to focus on his work at the United Nations. In May 1996 he traveled to the United States with sponsorship from the Mennonite Board of Missions and entered what was then called the Conflict Transformation Program at Eastern Mennonite University (now the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding) in the fall of the year. Following the completion of his degree in 1998, he returned to West Africa where he cofounded and was the first executive director of the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP). > ‚ÄúI dreamed of a regional movement of civil society that would collaborate > with regional intergovernmental bodies to restore not just stability in > Africa but democratic freedom and prosperity. I dreamed of establishing an > early-warning system throughout civil society that would head off violent > conflicts before they ravage our societies. Those dreams became reality in > just five years. The profound thing was the speed at which ordinary people > mobilized for peace through the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding.‚Äù  Work  During his time with WANEP he worked with several regional groups such as ECOWAS, the African Union, Club de Sahel and the United Nations (including ECOSOCC). It was during his time at WANEP that he was introduced to Leymah Gbowee whom he mentored to lead WANEP‚Äôs Women in Peacebuilding Network (WIPNET) branch in Liberia. WIPNET was the brainchild of Thelma Ekiyor of Nigeria and it became a special program of WANEP. Through WIPNET Leymah established the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace which went on to be a critical voice in the Liberia peace process and led to Leymah co-sharing the Nobel Peace Prize of 2011 with Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (President of Liberia) and Tawakkul Karman (Yemen). He also helped to implement and served as chair of the Forum on Early Warning and Early Response (FEWER), a London-based global network of scholars and practitioners who pioneered the concept of heading off conflict through early warnings collected at the grassroots.http://www.wanep.org/wanep/files/ar/ar_2002_en.pdf He cofounded the International Conflict and Security (INCAS) Consulting in London in 2003 with David Nyheim, Anton Ivanov, and Tom Porteous, where he also served as chair. Shortly thereafter Doe began working with the United Nations Development Program as Senior Conflict Prevention and Civil Society Development Expert with the Pacific Regional Center of UNDP in Fiji. From there he was hired as International Consultant for Evaluation and Strategic Coordination with the UN Mission in Liberia. In 2007 he was named Development and Reconciliation Advisor for the UN in Sri Lanka. From 2007-2010 he worked to resolve the conflict in Sri Lanka between Tamil and Sinhalese communities and documented human rights atrocities committed on all sides of the conflict. In 2011 he was reassigned to New York to assist in the preparation of the Secretary-General report on the Sri Lanka conflict as Senior Political Officer. This report detailed atrocities committed by all sides, but was particularly critical of the government‚Äôs actions during the conflict. From 2004 until 2010 Samuel Gbaydee Doe was also a Ph.D. student in social and international affairs at the University of Bradford, UK. His dissertation was titled ‚ÄúIndigenising post-war state reconstruction: the case of Liberia and Sierra Leone.‚Äù Doe is currently working as Senior Policy Advisor and Team Leader, Policy and Planning Division, Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery, at the UNDP in New York. He regularly teaches courses on conflict sensitive development and trauma healing at Eastern Mennonite University‚Äôs Center for Justice and Peacebuilding, almost always during its Summer Peacebuilding Institute, and at the Caux Center, in Caux Switzerland.AFP - http://augustafreepress.com/sam- gbaydee-doe-and-al-fuertes-two-spi-learnersteachers-who-keep-coming-back/  Publications  A list of Sam Gbaydee Doe's publications: * Hart B, Doe J, Gbaydee Doe S.

Established in 1917 as NKVD of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the agency was originally tasked with conducting regular police work and overseeing the country's prisons and labor camps. It was disbanded in 1930, with its functions being dispersed among other agencies, only to be reinstated as an all-union ministry in 1934. The functions of the OGPU (the secret police organization) were transferred to the NKVD in 1934, giving it a monopoly over law enforcement activities that lasted until the end of World War II. During this period, the NKVD included both ordinary public order activities, as well as secret police activities. The NKVD is known for its role in political repression and for carrying out the Great Purge under Joseph Stalin. It was led by Genrikh Yagoda, Nikolai Yezhov and Lavrentiy Beria.Yevgenia Albats, KGB: The State Within a State. 1995, page 101Robert Gellately. Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe. Knopf, 2007 p. 460Catherine Merridale. Night of Stone: Death and Memory in Twentieth- Century Russia. Penguin Books, 2002 p. 200 The NKVD undertook mass extrajudicial executions of untold numbers of citizens, and conceived, populated and administered the Gulag system of forced labour camps. Their agents were responsible for the repression of the wealthier peasantry, as well as the mass deportations of entire nationalities to uninhabited regions of the country. They oversaw the protection of Soviet borders and espionage (which included political assassinations), and enforced Soviet policy in communist movements and puppet governments in other countries, most notably the repression and massacres in Poland. In March 1946 all People's Commissariats were renamed to Ministries, and the NKVD became the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD).  History and structure  Early NKVD leaders Genrikh Yagoda, Vyacheslav Menzhinsky and Felix Dzerzhinsky, 1924 After the Russian February Revolution of 1917, the Provisional Government dissolved the Tsarist police and set up the People's Militsiya. The subsequent Russian October Revolution of 1917 saw a seizure of state power led by Lenin and the Bolsheviks, who established a new Bolshevik regime, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). The Provisional Government's Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), formerly under Georgy Lvov (from March 1917) and then under Nikolai Avksentiev (from ) and Alexei Nikitin (from ), turned into NKVD (People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs) under a People's Commissar. However, the NKVD apparatus was overwhelmed by duties inherited from MVD, such as the supervision of the local governments and firefighting, and the Workers' and Peasants' Militsiya staffed by proletarians was largely inexperienced and unqualified. Realizing that it was left with no capable security force, the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR established () a secret political police, the Cheka, led by Felix Dzerzhinsky. It gained the right to undertake quick non-judicial trials and executions, if that was deemed necessary in order to \\"protect the Russian Socialist-Communist revolution\\". The Cheka was reorganized in 1922 as the State Political Directorate, or GPU, of the NKVD of the RSFSR.Blank Pages by G.C.Malcher Page 7 In 1922 the USSR formed, with the RSFSR as its largest member. The GPU became the OGPU (Joint State Political Directorate), under the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR. The NKVD of the RSFSR retained control of the militsiya, and various other responsibilities. In 1934 the NKVD of the RSFSR was transformed into an all- union security force, the NKVD (which the Communist Party of the Soviet Union leaders soon came to call \\"the leading detachment of our party\\"), and the OGPU was incorporated into the NKVD as the Main Directorate for State Security (GUGB); the separate NKVD of the RSFSR was not resurrected until 1946 (as the MVD of the RSFSR). As a result, the NKVD also took over control of all detention facilities (including the forced labor camps, known as the GULag) as well as the regular police. At various times, the NKVD had the following Chief Directorates, abbreviated as \\"–ì–£\\"‚Äì , . :–ì–£–ì–ë ‚Äì –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, of State Security (GUGB, ) :–ì–£–†–ö–ú‚Äì —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–µ-–∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –º–∏–ª–∏—Ü–∏–∏, of Workers and Peasants Militsiya (GURKM, ) :–ì–£–ü–í–û‚Äì –ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–æ–π –∏ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–µ–π –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—ã, of Border and Internal Guards (GUPVO, ) :–ì–£–ü–û‚Äì –ø–æ–∂–∞—Ä–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—ã, of Firefighting Services (GUPO, ) :–ì–£–®–æ—Å–î–æ—Ä‚Äì —à–æ—Å—Å–µ–π–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥, of Highways(GU≈†D, ) :–ì–£–ñ–î‚Äì –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥, of Railways (GU≈ΩD, ) :–ì–£–õ–∞–≥‚Äì –ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ- —Ç—Ä—É–¥–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä–µ–π –∏ –∫–æ–ª–æ–Ω–∏–π, (GULag, ) :–ì–≠–£ ‚Äì —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ, of Economics (GEU, ) :–ì–¢–£ ‚Äì —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ–µ, of Transport (GTU, ) :–ì–£–í–ü–ò ‚Äì –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö, of POWs and interned persons (GUVPI, ) =Yezhov era= Until the reorganization begun by Nikolai Yezhov with a purge of the regional political police in the autumn of 1936 and formalized by a May 1939 directive of the All-Union NKVD by which all appointments to the local political police were controlled from the center, there was frequent tension between centralized control of local units and the collusion of those units with local and regional party elements, frequently resulting in the thwarting of Moscow's plans. James Harris, \\"Dual subordination ? The political police and the party in the Urals region, 1918‚Äì1953\\", Cahiers du monde russe 22 (2001):423‚Äì446. Following its establishment in 1934, the NKVD underwent many organizational changes; between 1938 and 1939 alone, the NKVD's structure and leadership changed three times. During Yezhov's time in office, the Great Purge reached its height from the years 1937 and 1938 alone, at least 1.3 million were arrested and 681,692 were executed for 'crimes against the state'. The Gulag population swelled by 685,201 under Yezhov, nearly tripling in size in just two years, with at least 140,000 of these prisoners (and likely many more) dying of malnutrition, exhaustion and the elements in the camps (or during transport to them).Figes, Orlando (2007) The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia , page 234. On 3 February 1941, the 4th Department (Special Section, OO) of GUGB NKVD security service responsible for the Soviet Armed Forces military counter-intelligence,GUGB NKVD. DocumentsTalk.com, 2008. consisting of 12 Sections and one Investigation Unit, was separated from GUGB NKVD USSR. The official liquidation of OO GUGB within NKVD was announced on 12 February by a joint order No. 00151/003 of NKVD and NKGB USSR. The rest of GUGB was abolished and staff was moved to newly created People's Commissariat for State Security (NKGB). Departments of former GUGB were renamed Directorates. For example, foreign intelligence unit known as Foreign Department (INO) became Foreign Directorate (INU); GUGB political police unit represented by Secret Political Department (SPO) became Secret Political Directorate (SPU), and so on. The former GUGB 4th Department (OO) was split into three sections. One section, which handled military counter-intelligence in NKVD troops (former 11th Section of GUGB 4th Department OO) become 3rd NKVD Department or OKR (Otdel KontrRazvedki), the chief of OKR NKVD was Aleksander Belyanov. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union (June 1941), the NKGB USSR was abolished and on July 20, 1941 the units that formed NKGB becomes part of NKVD USSR. The military CI was also upgraded from department to directorate and pot in NKVD organization as (Directorate of Special Departments or UOO NKVD USSR). The only section did not return to UOO NKVD till 11 of January 1942 was one responsible for counterintelligence in NKVMF (Navy). It returned to NKVD control on January 11, 1942 as UOO 9th Department controlled by P. Gladkov. In April 1943 Directorate of Special Departments was transformed in to SMERSH and transferred to People's Defense and Commissariates. At the same time, the NKVD was reduced in size and duties again by creating NKGB as independent State Security Commissariate. In 1946, all Soviet Commissariats were renamed \\"ministries\\". Accordingly, the Peoples Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) of the USSR became the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), while the NKGB was renamed as the Ministry of State Security (MGB). In 1953, after the arrest of Lavrenty Beria, the MGB merged back into the MVD. The police and security services finally split in 1954 to become: * The USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), responsible for the criminal militia and correctional facilities. * The USSR Committee for State Security (KGB), responsible for the political police, intelligence, counter- intelligence, personal protection (of the leadership) and confidential communications. =Main Directorates (Departments)= State Security * Workers-Peasants Militsiya * Border and Internal Security * Firefighting security * Correction and Labor camps * Other smaller departments  Department of Civil registration  Financial (FINO)  Administration  Human resources  Secretariat  Special assignment Ranking system (State Security) In 1935‚Äì1945 Main Directorate of State Security of NKVD had its own ranking system before it was merged in the Soviet military standardized ranking system. ;Top-level commanding staff * Commissioner General of State Security (later in 1935) * Commissioner of State Security 1st Class * Commissioner of State Security 2nd Class * Commissioner of State Security 3rd Class * Commissioner of State Security (Senior Major of State Security, before 1943) ;Senior commanding staff * Colonel of State Security (Major of State Security, before 1943) * Lieutenant Colonel of State Security (Captain of State Security, before 1943) * Major of State Security (Senior Lieutenant of State Security, before 1943) ;Mid-level commanding staff * Captain of State Security (Lieutenant of State Security, before 1943) * Senior Lieutenant of State Security (Junior Lieutenant of State Security, before 1943) * Lieutenant of State Security (Sergeant of State Security, before 1942) * Junior Lieutenant of State Security (Sergeant of State Security, before 1942) ;Junior commanding staff * Master Sergeant of Special Service (from 1943) * Senior Sergeant of Special Service (from 1943) * Sergeant of Special Service (from 1943) * Junior Sergeant of Special Service (from 1943)  NKVD activities  The main function of the NKVD was to protect the state security of the Soviet Union. This role was accomplished through massive political repression, including authorised murders of many thousands of politicians and citizens, as well as kidnappings, assassinations and mass deportations. =Domestic repressions= NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda (middle) inspecting the construction of the Moscow-Volga canal, 1935 In implementing Soviet internal policy towards perceived enemies of the Soviet state (\\"enemies of the people\\"), untold multitudes of people were sent to GULAG camps and hundreds of thousands were executed by the NKVD. Formally, most of these people were convicted by NKVD troikas (\\"triplets\\")‚Äì special courts martial. Evidential standards were very low: a tip-off by an anonymous informer was considered sufficient grounds for arrest. Use of \\"physical means of persuasion\\" (torture) was sanctioned by a special decree of the state, which opened the door to numerous abuses, documented in recollections of victims and members of the NKVD itself. Hundreds of mass graves resulting from such operations were later discovered throughout the country. Documented evidence exists that the NKVD committed mass extrajudicial executions, guided by secret \\"plans\\". Those plans established the number and proportion of victims (officially \\"public enemies\\") in a given region (e.g. the quotas for clergy, former nobles etc., regardless of identity). The families of the repressed, including children, were also automatically repressed according to NKVD Order no. 00486. The purges were organized in a number of waves according to the decisions of the Politburo of the Communist Party. Some examples are the campaigns among engineers (Shakhty Trial), party and military elite plots (Great Purge with Order 00447), and medical staff (\\"Doctors' Plot\\").

For example, the Polish Operation of the NKVD in 1937‚Äì1938 resulted in the execution of 111,091 Poles.Goldman, Wendy Z. (2011). Inventing the Enemy: Denunciation and Terror in Stalin's Russia. New York: Cambridge University Press. . p. 217. Whole populations of certain ethnicities were forcibly resettled. Foreigners living in the Soviet Union were given particular attention. When disillusioned American citizens living in the Soviet Union thronged the gates of the U.S. embassy in Moscow to plead for new U.S. passports to leave the USSR (their original U.S. passports had been taken for 'registration' purposes years before), none were issued. Instead, the NKVD promptly arrested all of the Americans, who were taken to Lubyanka Prison and later shot.Tzouliadis, Tim, The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia Penguin Press (2008), : Many of the Americans desiring to return home were communists who had voluntarily moved to the Soviet Union, while others moved to Soviet Union as skilled auto workers to help produce cars at the recently constructed GAZ automobile factory built by the Ford Motor Company. All were U.S. citizens. American factory workers at the Soviet Ford GAZ plant, suspected by Stalin of being 'poisoned' by Western influences, were dragged off with the others to Lubyanka by the NKVD in the very same Ford Model A cars they had helped build, where they were tortured; nearly all were executed or died in labor camps. Many of the slain Americans were dumped in the mass grave at Yuzhnoye Butovo District near Moscow.Tzouliadis, Tim, The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia Penguin Press (2008), Even so, the people of the Soviet Republics still formed the majority of NKVD victims[*17][*18]. The NKVD also served as arm of the Russian Soviet communist government for the lethal mass persecution and destruction of ethnic minorities and religious beliefs, such as the Russian Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Greek Catholics, Islam, Judaism and other religious organizations, an operation headed by Yevgeny Tuchkov. =International operations= Lavrentiy Beria with Stalin (in background) and Stalin's daughter Svetlana During the 1930s, the NKVD was responsible for political murders of those Stalin believed to oppose him. Espionage networks headed by experienced multilingual NKVD officers such as Pavel Sudoplatov and Iskhak Akhmerov were established in nearly every major Western country, including the United States. The NKVD recruited agents for its espionage efforts from all walks of life, from unemployed intellectuals such as Mark Zborowski to aristocrats such as Martha Dodd. Besides the gathering of intelligence, these networks provided organizational assistance for so-called wet business,Barmine, Alexander, One Who Survived, New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), p. 18: NKVD expression for a political murder where enemies of the USSR either disappeared or were openly liquidated.John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999) The NKVD's intelligence and special operations (Inostranny Otdel) unit organized overseas assassinations of political enemies of the USSR, such as leaders of nationalist movements, former Tsarist officials, and personal rivals of Joseph Stalin. Among the officially confirmed victims of such plots were: * Leon Trotsky, a personal political enemy of Stalin and his most bitter international critic, killed in Mexico City in 1940; * Yevhen Konovalets, prominent Ukrainian patriot leader who was attempting to create a separatist movement in Soviet Ukraine; assassinated in Rotterdam, Netherlands *Yevgeny Miller, former General of the Tsarist (Imperial Russian) Army; in the 1930s, he was responsible for funding anti-communist movements inside the USSR with the support of European governments. Kidnapped in Paris and brought to Moscow, where he was interrogated and executed * Noe Ramishvili, Prime Minister of independent Georgia, fled to France after the Bolshevik takeover; responsible for funding and coordinating Georgian nationalist organizations and the August uprising, he was assassinated in Paris * Boris Savinkov, Russian revolutionary and anti-Bolshevik terrorist (lured back into Russia and killed in 1924 by the Trust Operation of the GPU); * Sidney Reilly, British agent of the MI6 who deliberately entered Russia in 1925 trying to expose the Trust Operation to avenge Savinkov's death; * Alexander Kutepov, former General of the Tsarist (Imperial Russian) Army, who was active in organizing anti-communist groups with the support of French and British governments Prominent political dissidents were also found dead under highly suspicious circumstances, including Walter Krivitsky, Lev Sedov, Ignace Reiss and former German Communist Party (KPD) member Willi M√ºnzenberg.Barmine, Alexander, One Who Survived, New York: G.P.

Sheng and the Soviets alleged a massive Trotskyist conspiracy and a \\"Fascist Trotskyite plot\\" to destroy the Soviet Union. The Soviet Consul General Garegin Apresoff, General Ma Hushan, Ma Shaowu, Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han-chang and Hoja-Niyaz were among the 435 alleged conspirators in the plot. Xinjiang came under soviet influence. =Spanish Civil War= During the Spanish Civil War, NKVD agents, acting in conjunction with the Communist Party of Spain, exercised substantial control over the Republican government, using Soviet military aid to help further Soviet influence. The NKVD established numerous secret prisons around the capital Madrid, which were used to detain, torture, and kill hundreds of the NKVD's enemies, at first focusing on Spanish Nationalists and Spanish Catholics, while from late 1938 increasingly anarchists and Trotskyists were the objects of persecution. In 1937 Andr√©s Nin, the secretary of the Trotskyist POUM and his colleagues were tortured and killed in an NKVD prison in Barcelona. =World War II operations= The corpses of victims of the NKVD murdered in last days of June 1941, in one of the NKVD prisoner massacres just after outbreak of the German-Soviet War. Prior to the German invasion, in order to accomplish its own goals, the NKVD was prepared to cooperate even with such organizations as the German Gestapo. In March 1940 representatives of the NKVD and the Gestapo met for one week in Zakopane, to coordinate the pacification of Poland; see Gestapo‚ÄìNKVD Conferences. For its part, the Soviet Union delivered hundreds of German and Austrian Communists to the Gestapo, as unwanted foreigners, together with their documents. However, many NKVD units were later to fight the Wehrmacht, for example the 10th Rifle Division NKVD, which fought at the Battle of Stalingrad. After the German invasion the NKVD evacuated and killed prisoners. During World War II, NKVD Internal Troops units were used for rear area security, including preventing the retreat of Soviet Union army divisions. Though mainly intended for internal security, NKVD divisions were sometimes used at the front to stem the occurrence of desertion through Stalin's Order No. 270 and Order No. 227 decrees in 1941 and 1942, which aimed to raise troop morale via brutality and coercion. At the beginning of the war the NKVD formed 15 rifle divisions, which had expanded by 1945 to 53 divisions and 28 brigades.Zaloga, Steven J. The Red Army of the Great Patriotic War, 1941‚Äì45, Osprey Publishing, (1989), pp. 21‚Äì22 A list of identified NKVD Internal Troops divisions can be seen at List of Soviet Union divisions. Though mainly intended for internal security, NKVD divisions were sometimes used in the front-lines, for example during the Battle of Stalingrad and the Crimean Offensive of 1944. Unlike the Waffen-SS, the NKVD did not field any armored or mechanized units. In the enemy-held territories, the NKVD carried out numerous missions of sabotage. After fall of Kiev, NKVD agents set fire to the Nazi headquarters and various other targets, eventually burning down much of the city center. Similar actions took place across the occupied Byelorussia and Ukraine. The NKVD (later KGB) carried out mass arrests, deportations, and executions. The targets included both collaborators with Germany and non-Communist resistance movements such as the Polish Armia Krajowa and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army aiming to separate from the Soviet Union, among others. The NKVD also executed tens of thousands of Polish political prisoners in 1939‚Äì1941, including the Katy≈Ñ massacre. NKVD units were also used to repress the prolonged partisan war in Ukraine and the Baltics, which lasted until the early 1950s. =Postwar operations= After the death of Stalin in 1953, the new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev halted the NKVD purges. From the 1950s to the 1980s, thousands of victims were legally \\"rehabilitated\\" (i.e., acquitted and had their rights restored). Many of the victims and their relatives refused to apply for rehabilitation out of fear or lack of documents. The rehabilitation was not complete: in most cases the formulation was \\"due to lack of evidence of the case of crime\\". Only a limited number of persons were rehabilitated with the formulation \\"cleared of all charges\\". Very few NKVD agents were ever officially convicted of the particular violation of anyone's rights. Legally, those agents executed in the 1930s were also \\"purged\\" without legitimate criminal investigations and court decisions. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade) a small number of ex-NKVD agents living in the Baltic states were convicted of crimes against the local population. =Intelligence activities= These included: * Establishment of a widespread spy network through the Comintern. * Operations of Richard Sorge, the \\"Red Orchestra\\", Willi Lehmann, and other agents who provided valuable intelligence during World War II. * Recruitment of important UK officials as agents in the 1940s. * Penetration of British intelligence (MI6) and counter- intelligence (MI5) services. * Collection of detailed nuclear weapons design information from the U.S. and Britain. * Disruption of several confirmed plots to assassinate Stalin. * Establishment of the People's Republic of Poland and earlier its communist party along with training activists, during World War II. The first President of Poland after the war was Boles≈Çaw Bierut, an NKVD agent. = Soviet economy = Sergei Korolev shortly after his arrest, 1938 The extensive system of labor exploitation in the Gulag made a notable contribution to the Soviet economy and the development of remote areas. Colonization of Siberia, the North and Far East was among the explicitly stated goals in the very first laws concerning Soviet labor camps. Mining, construction works (roads, railways, canals, dams, and factories), logging, and other functions of the labor camps were part of the Soviet planned economy, and the NKVD had its own production plans. The most unusual part of the NKVD's achievements was its role in Soviet science and arms development. Many scientists and engineers arrested for political crimes were placed in special prisons, much more comfortable than the Gulag, colloquially known as sharashkas. These prisoners continued their work in these prisons. When later released, some of them became world leaders in science and technology. Among such sharashka members were Sergey Korolev, the head designer of the Soviet rocket program and first human space flight mission in 1961, and Andrei Tupolev, the famous airplane designer. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was also imprisoned in a sharashka, and based his novel The First Circle on his experiences there. After World War II, the NKVD coordinated work on Soviet nuclear weaponry, under the direction of General Pavel Sudoplatov. The scientists were not prisoners, but the project was supervised by the NKVD because of its great importance and the corresponding requirement for absolute security and secrecy. Also, the project used information obtained by the NKVD from the United States. People's Commissars The agency was headed by a people's commissar (minister). His first deputy was the director of State Security Service (GUGB). * 1934‚Äì1936 Genrikh Yagoda, both people's commissar of Interior and director of State Security * 1936‚Äì1938 Nikolai Yezhov, people's commissar of Interior  1936‚Äì1937 Yakov Agranov, director of State Security (as the first deputy)  1937‚Äì1938 Mikhail Frinovsky, director of State Security (as the first deputy)  1938 Lavrentiy Beria, director of State Security (as the first deputy) * 1938‚Äì1945 Lavrentiy Beria, people's commissar of Interior  1938‚Äì1941 Vsevolod Merkulov, director of State Security (as the first deputy)  1941‚Äì1943 Vsevolod Merkulov, director of State Security (as the first deputy) * 1945‚Äì1946 Sergei Kruglov, people's commissar of Interior Note: In the first half of 1941 Vsevolod Merkulov transformed his agency into separate commissariat (ministry), but it was merged back to the people's commissariat of Interior soon after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. In 1943 Merkulov once again split his agency this time for good. Officers Andrei Zhukov has singlehandedly identified every single NKVD officer involved in 1930s arrests and killings by researching a Moscow archive. There are just over 40,000 names on the list.

Distribution and habitat Anilocra pomacentri is found in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef in eastern Australia. It attaches itself just above and behind the eye to its host fish, the yellowback puller, a denizen of shallow water coral reefs. It is particularly prevalent on fish inhabiting patch reefs. Biology Yellowback puller, the host fish Both adult and juvenile Anilocra pomacentri parasitise the yellowback puller (Chromis nitida), a small reef damselfish. It seems that the juvenile isopod, known as a manca, latches onto the skin of the fish when both are small and the size of the parasite increases as the fish grows. Anilocra pomacentri is a sequential hermaphrodite. It starts its life as a male and specimens between in telson length bear the \\"appendix masculina\\" (part of the second pleopod) characteristic of the male stage. It later loses this and becomes a female which sucks the blood of its fish host. The female has a lifespan of about a year during which time it typically produces three batches of eggs, brooding them in the marsupium underneath the thorax. The developing mancae pass through four stages before being released into the sea, by which time they are infective and seek out suitable host fishes. Infected fish show significant reductions in their rate of growth and their fecundity, have a lower number of circulating red blood cells and have an increase in mortality.

In 1864, the Wisconsin Legislature approved the removal of all the bodies from Oconomowoc Cemetery on Walnut Street to the current La Belle Cemetery grounds. The land that is now the grounds for the La Belle Cemetery was first owned by Charles Sheldon, which he donated when the Oconomowoc Cemetery became too crowded. The oldest recorded stones in the cemetery have been there since the early 1800s. Some graves have no headstone and there are no records of who is buried there, just a little X marking a burial spot. The most common symbols found on the headstones are religious crosses. The two mausoleums people visit are the ones for the Kohl family and the Sheldon family. In the cemetery, there is a section for infants and children younger than six years old. Another section was specified for the newest style headstones, which are black marble with pictures and drawings.

He is the editor-in-chief of Russia's extreme-right (or radical-reactionary) newspaper Zavtra (\\"–ó–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞\\", Tomorrow), that combines ultranationalist and anti- capitalist views. Early life Alexander Prokhanov was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, to which his ancestors, members of the Russian Christian \\"Molokan\\" sect, had been deported by Catherine the Great. His grand-uncle Ivan Prokhanov was a leader of the All-Russian Union of Evangelican Christians (1908‚Äì1928) and the one-time vice-President of the Baptist World Alliance who left the USSR in 1928 and died as an emigr√©. In 1955, Prokhanov enrolled into the Moscow Aviation Institute where for the first time he started to write poetry and prose. After the graduation he worked as an engineer at a Ministry of Defense factory, then, in 1962‚Äì1964, as a forester in Karelia and the Moscow Oblast. In the late 1960s he started writing essays and reports for numerous magazines (Krugozor, Smena, Selskaya Molodyozh), later citing Andrey Platonov and Vladimir Nabokov as major influences. Career Prokhanov's short story \\"The Wedding\\" (1967) garnered some critical praise and is considered his breakthrough. Two years later, he was working for the Soviet newspapers, Pravda and Literaturnaya Gazeta. As a foreign correspondent Prokhanov visited Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Cambodia, Angola, and Ethiopia, these assignments providing him invaluable material for future literary work. Prokhanov was the first to report on the March 1969 events on Damansky Island during the Sino- Soviet border conflict. In 1971, his first book I Am Going My Way came out. His literary mentor Yuri Trifonov provided a foreword for it. Prokhanov later remembered: \\"He liked the expressiveness, experiments with language, the flow of metaphors, my naive youthful pantheism. ... But my first social-oriented novellas made him skeptical, his tone became tougher and he entrusted me with another patron, Vladimir Makanin, who was my good friend at the time.\\" In 1972, Prokhanov became a member of the Soviet Union of Writers. In the mid-1980s he was an active contributor to Molodaya Gvardiya, Nash Sovremennik, and the newspaper Literaturnaya Rossiya. In 1990, Prokhanov emerged as a candidate for the post of Literaturnaya Gazeta editor-in-chief, but the staff ignored him, preferring Fyodor Burlatsky, Mikhail Gorbachev's prot√©g√©. In 1989‚Äì1991, Prokhanov worked as the editor-in-chief of Sovetskaya Literatura, a magazine published in nine languages in more than one hundred countries. Enjoying his reputation of a hard-line Communist, he's never joined the Communist Party. In December 1990 (while still head of Sovetskaya Literatura), Prokhanov founded Den (–î–µ–Ω—å, Day), and became its editor-in-chief. Initially an organ of the Union of Soviet Writers, in the summer of 1991, Den moved under the patronage of the Union of Writers of Russia. Sporting the subheading \\"Organ of the spiritual opposition\\", it became arguably the most radical Russian newspaper continually challenging Boris Yeltsin and his team of liberal reformers. Regarded by Prokhanov as the \\"patriotic alternative\\" to pro-liberal, nomenclature-led Literaturnaya Gazeta, Den managed to attract authors from the conflicting flanks of the Russian opposition movement, united by their hatred of the liberal reforms but divided in their attitude towards Communism. Among them were ultra-nationalists, whose publications caused outrage, several Jewish organizations condemning Den as anti-Semitic.Russia: Experiment with a People, Service, Robert, 2006, Harvard University Press, 144-145 and 225-226 regarding Den and 74 and 225-226 regarding A Word to the People. It was Prokhanov who, in July 1991, wrote the text of \\"A Word to the People\\", a political open letter subsequently signed by Gennady Zyuganov, Vasily Starodubtsev, Igor Shafarevich, Valentin Rasputin, Valentin Varennikov, and Eduard Volodin among others. The document calling for the formation of a united \\"patriotic front\\" was seen, in retrospect, as an ideological platform for the failed August coup d'etat attempt. The publication of the manifest brought about the rift between Prokhanov and General Alexander Rutskoy (whom he once helped to be rescued from captivity in Afghanistan and later backed his election campaign). The latter, speaking on Russian TV, promised his former friend \\"ten years in jail.\\" During the failed August 1991 coup, Prokhanov supported the junta calling itself the State Emergency Committee. In 1992 he joined the National Salvation Front's leadership, alongside Gennady Zyuganov, Nikolai Pavlov, Mikhail Astafyev and Igor Shafarevich, among others. The same year he created the Day Movement in an attempt to turn his newspaper's readership into a political force. During the September 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, Den became a mouthpiece for the radical opposition and Prokhanov got notoriety as a harsh critic of Yeltsin. After the Russian Parliament's demise in October that year Den was banned by the Russian Ministry of Justice. The newspaper re-emerged as Zavtra on 5 November 1993. For the rest of the 1990s, Prokhanov felt persecuted and marginalized. \\"Even in Soviet times I had the reputation of an \\"ode-singer to the State\\", they called me \\"the Army Headquarters' Nightingale\\". Now in all of their [new] dictionaries I've got demonized. While my friends, like Anatoly Kim, emerged as the aesthetes, I have been presented as an obscurantist. They advised Western publishers against translating me, putting me under blockade,\\" Prokhanov complained, speaking to Zakhar Prilepin. Things changed in the early 2000s when Prokhanov found himself among the Russian literary elite, even if his prose was getting increasingly morbid, surreal and apocalyptic. As the 1999 terrorist attacks upon residential houses shocked Russia, Prokhanov accused the state secret services in plotting these attacks and based his next novel upon these suspicions. In 2002, Mr. Hexogen (2001) brought him the National Bestseller Award.A.A.Prokanov @ Russian Profile In the mid-2000s, churning out several books a year (including numerous re-makes of his best- known 20th-century work), Prokhanov became an omnipresent character of the Russian media, frequenting TV talk shows and disputes as a token \\"opposition's spiritual leader\\". Since 2003, he has been a regular guest of Vladimir Solovyov's prime time political shows On the Stand and Duel. From 2007‚Äì2014, Prokhanov had a one-hour weekly slot at the pro-liberal Echo of Moscow radio station. Another prominent station he's been contributing to since 2009 is the Russian News Service where he has two one-hour programs a week. In 2013‚Äì2014 he appeared regularly at the Russia-24 TV channel with his \\"Replika\\" (\\"A Comment\\") slot. =Works= Prokhanov on 14 June 2007, presenting the book Beyond the Rublyovka Fences. Prokhanov debuted with a short story collection I Am Going My Way (1971), starting out as a proponent of the village prose movement, portraying the life of the ordinary Soviet villagers obsessed with keeping the old traditions and customs going. \\"The theme of Russia and Russian people for Prokhanov is not a vogue, but part of his very soul; this young author's prose is incredibly sincere,\\" Yuri Trifonov commented in a foreword. It was followed by The Unburnt Blossom (1972), the collection of sketches from the Soviet country life, and The Grass Gets Yellow (1974), a collection of stories and novellas much in the same vein. Prokhanov's first novel The Nomadic Rose (1975) dealt with the Soviet life in Siberia and Russian Far East which he had travelled over extensively by this time. The Time is Noon (1977), The Locale (1979) and The Eternal City (1981) continued exploring the technological progress versus nature theme. In the 1980s, Prokhanov moved into the field of war and politics, using his vast foreign correspondent experience. The Tree in the Center of Kabul (1982), the Campuchea chronicles Hunter of the Isles (1983), the Africanist (1984) and the Nicaraguan epic And Then Comes the Wind (1984) formed \\"The Burning Gardens\\" tetralogy, all four novels characterized by dynamic action, over-the-top style of language and idealized, heroic protagonists. The Afghan War was the subject of his next two novels, Drawings of a Batalist (1986) and 600 Years After the Battle (1988). Among Prokhanov's well-known work of the time were novellas \\"Polina\\" (1976), \\"The Unseen Corn\\" (1976), \\"By The Moon-Ray\\", \\"Snow and Coal\\" (both 1977), \\"Grey-Haired Soldier\\" (1985), and \\"The Armourer (1986), as well as short novels The Admiral (1983) and Lighter Than Asure (1986). Prokhanov's 1989 novella \\"The Muslim Wedding\\" brought him The Anton Chekhov Prize (for the Story of the Year). According to critic P.V.Bekedin, everything that has been written by Prokhanov since 1991 goes under the heading \\"the literature of Russian resistance.\\" The Last Soldier of the Empire (1993) told the story of the 1991 Coup and the demise of the USSR. Brown-Red (1999),\\"Brown Red\\", –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ-–∫–æ—Ä–∏—á–Ω–µ–≤—ã–µ, was the term coined by the Russian liberal media in the 1990s to describe the post-Communist brand of Neo-Fascism.

His 2005 novel Political Scientist featured a character named Dyshlov, a thinly veiled caricature of Zyuganov whom Prokhanov has been completely disillusioned with recently and holds responsible for the inefficiency of the Russian left. Speaking of this novel, poet and novelist Dmitry Bykov remarked: \\"Prokhanov is an immensely gifted writer, yet his prose is but a puke.\\" Prokhanov's 2012 book, The Tread of the Russian Triumph (2012) is a fictionalized treatise on Russian history promoting the author's very own \\"Fifth Empire\\" doctrine stating that the current Eurasian Economic Union has already started to evolve into a new geo-political giant, the successor to the four previous Empires: Kievan Rus'/Novgorod Republic, Moscovy, the Romanovs' Russian Empire, and Stalin's USSR.The Fifth Empire Is Getting Born Right Now. newsland.com \\"There will be a place for everyone in it: the left and the right, Orthodox Christians and Muslim fundamentalists, synagogues and big business... like the Bolsheviks used the potential of the Romanov Empire, the Fifth Empire is to be composed of all kinds of disparate elements,\\" he commented. =Accolades= State awardsLenin Komsomol Prize (1982) *Order of the Red Banner (1984) *Order of the Badge of Honour *Order of the Red Starhttp://www.calend.ru/person/1957/ Alexander Prokhanov biography. - www.calend.ru Literary awards The Konstantin Fedin Award (1980) * The USSR Ministry of Defense Literary Prize (1988) * The International Mikhail Sholokhov Prize (1998) * National Bestseller Prize (2002) * The Bunin Prize (2009) * The All-Russian Nikolai Leskov Prize (2012) *The Golden Delvig (Literaturnaya Gazeta Prize, 2013) Political activism Prokhanov with Aleksey Mozgovoy, the Lugansk militia leader. 7 August 2014 A controversial figure, Prokanov in Russia is seen by some as an original author sporting \\"a rare combination of mostmodernist ethics and imperialist agenda,\\"–Æ—Ä–∏–π –ü–æ–ª—è–∫–æ–≤. –°–µ—Ä—å—ë–∑–Ω—ã–º –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º \\"–ë—É–∫–µ—Ä–æ–≤\\" –Ω–µ –¥–∞—é—Ç / –õ—É—á—à–∏–µ –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ and by others as a purveyor of extremist nationalistic views which formed the ideological platform of Zavtra, the ultra-conservative newspaper he's been the leader of since 1993. Fellow Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin credited Prokhanov with being \\"the godfather] of the New Russia opposition movement\\" even if deploring his refusal to take a more active part in it and choosing instead to back up political figures Dugin referred to as \\"the Staraya Square monsters\\". In 1991, during the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic presidential election, Prokhanov worked for the campaign of General Albert Makashov, an ultra-conservative candidate. In September 1992, Prokhanov was one of the initiators of the National Salvation Front, of which‚Äî until April 1994‚Äî he was a co-chairman. In September 1994, as one of the organizers of the All-Russian Congress of Patriotic Forces, Prokhanov was among those who signed the petition demanding the President's resignation. In July 1991, he signed the open letter, \\"A Word to the People\\", sometimes considered a program for the August coup makers. During the failed August 1991 coup, Prokhanov supported the State Emergency Committee. In the summer of 1992, Prokhanov formed the so-called \\"Day Movement\\", as an attempt to turn the newspaper's readership into a political movement. On 4 October 1993, the Ministry of Justice of Russia ordered a stop to the editorial and publishing activity of the newspaper Day; its office was raided by OMON, archive files and property was confiscated, staff members were physically assaulted. On the same day, after the Supreme Soviet's defenders' defeat, Prokhanov went into hiding in the woods on the outskirts of Ryazan. A week later he managed to publish several issues of Den in Minsk. In November 1993, Prokhanov's son-in-law Alexander Khudorozhkov registered the newspaper Zavtra (Tomorrow). Prokhanov became its editor-in-chief. In the 1996 Russian presidential election, Prokhanov supported the leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Gennady Zyuganov. In 1997, he co-founded the Agency of Patriotic Information. Twice (in 1997 and 1999), he was physically assaulted, the first of these accidents ending with him hospitalized, suffering severe concussion. In 1999, together with Konstantin Kasimovsky, Prokhanov invited former klansman David Duke to visit the Russian Federation. In 2003, Prokhanov, Berezovsky, and Viktor Alksnis issued a joint statement concerning the Nord Ost terrorist attack, blaming the Russian authorities for the heavy loss of life and accusing Vladimir Putin of inefficiency. Also in 2003, Berezovsky and Prokhanov issued another joint memorandum, this time blaming the authorities for the murder of Sergei Yushenkov, and warning the people against the \\"great dangers coming from the Kremlin.\\" His newspaper, Zavtra, had supported the Communist Party of the Russian Federation since the mid-1990s, but in 2005 it switched his support to the Rodina (\\"Motherland\\") party.\\"Party Number Four\\", Rodina: Whence and Why? , by Alexei Titkov, Panorama Centre, Moscow, 2006, , p24-25. Commenting on the Russian war with Georgia, Prokhanov said that Russia \\"has not been defeated by the West in the Cold War, because the Cold War continues. We lost gigantic territories, but we held Moscow. From here we launched our counterattack.\\" Prokhanov founded Izborsk Club, a Eurasian think tank, in 2012. During the 2014 conflict in Ukraine, Prokhanov praised the Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed pro-Russian Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Borodai as a \\"true White Russian nationalist\\". In November 2014, a Russian court ordered Prokhanov to pay 500 thousand rubles to Andrey Makarevich whom he falsely accused (in the Izvestia-published article) of entertaining paratroopers in Sloviansk (\\"where he was heard by people in basements with broken hands and put out eyes\\") while the singer in fact performed in Sviatohirsk, singing for refugees.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is the intermediate stage between a capitalist economy and a communist economy, whereby the post-revolutionary state seizes the means of production and compels the implementation of direct elections on behalf and within the confines of the ruling proletarian state party. Instituting elected delegates into representative workers' councils that nationalise ownership of the means of production from private to collective ownership. During this phase, the administrative organizational structure of the party is to be largely determined by the need for it to govern firmly and wield state power to prevent counterrevolution and to facilitate the transition to a lasting communist society. The socialist revolutionary Joseph Weydemeyer coined the term dictatorship of the proletariat, which Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels adopted to their philosophy and economics. The term dictatorship indicates full control of the means of production by the state apparatus. The planning of material production would service the social and economic needs of the population, such as the right to education, health and welfare services, public housing. The Paris Commune (1871), which controlled the capital city for two months, before being suppressed, was an example of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In Marxist philosophy, the term dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is the antonym to the dictatorship of the proletariat. There are multiple popular trends for this political thought, all of which believe the state will be retained post-revolution for its enforcement capabilities: * Marxism‚ÄìLeninism follows the ideas of Marxism and Leninism. It seeks to organise a vanguard party, which in concept Marx advocated for based on his writings on the proletariat dictatorship and on the phrase itself, and to thus lead a proletarian uprising to assume power of the state, the economy, the media, and social services (academia, health and so on), on behalf of the proletariat and to construct a single-party socialist state representing a dictatorship of the proletariat. The dictatorship of the proletariat is to be governed through the process of democratic centralism, which Lenin described as \\"diversity in discussion, unity in action\\". Marxism‚ÄìLeninism forms the official ideology of the ruling parties of China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam and was the official ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from the late 1920s, and later of the other ruling parties making up the Eastern Bloc. * Libertarian Marxists criticize Marxism‚ÄìLeninism for perceived differences from orthodox Marxism, opposing the Leninist principle of democratic centralism and the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist interpretation of vanguardism. Along with Trotskyists, they also oppose the use of a one-party state which they view as inherently undemocratic, although Trotskyists are still Bolsheviks, subscribing to democratic centralism and soviet democracy, seeing their ideology as a more accurate interpretation of Leninism. Rosa Luxemburg, a Marxist theorist, emphasized the role of the vanguard party as representative of the whole class \\"The social democrats are the most enlightened, most class- conscious vanguard of the proletariat. They cannot and dare not wait, in a fatalist fashion, with folded arms for the advent of the \\"revolutionary situation,\\" to wait for that which in every spontaneous peoples' movement, falls from the clouds. On the contrary, they must now, as always, hasten the development of things and endeavour to accelerate events.\\" \\"The Spartacus League is only the most conscious, purposeful part of the proletariat, which points the entire broad mass of the working class toward its historical tasks at every step, which represents in each particular stage of the Revolution the ultimate socialist goal, and in all national questions the interests of the proletarian world revolution.\\" and the dictatorship of the proletariat as the entire proletariat's rule, characterizing the dictatorship of the proletariat as a concept meant to expand democracy rather than reduce it‚Äîas opposed to minority rule in the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. In The Road to Serfdom (1944), the economist Friedrich Hayek wrote that the dictatorship of the proletariat likely would destroy personal freedom as completely as does an autocracy. The European Commission of Human Rights found pursuing the dictatorship of the proletariat incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights in Communist Party of Germany v. the Federal Republic of Germany (1957).  Theoretical approaches  = Karl Marx = Karl Marx did not write much about the nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat, but in The Communist Manifesto (1848) he and Engels said that \\"their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions\\".Communist Manifesto, 1848, Chapter IV In light of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Marx said that \\"there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror\\". On 1 January 1852, the communist journalist Joseph Weydemeyer published an article entitled \\"Dictatorship of the Proletariat\\" in the German language newspaper Turn-Zeitung, where he wrote that \\"it is quite plain that there cannot be here any question of gradual, peaceful transitions\\" and recalled the examples of Oliver Cromwell (England) and Committee of Public Safety (France) as examples of \\"dictatorship\\" and \\"terrorism\\" (respectively) required to overthrow the bourgeoisie. In that year, Marx wrote to him, saying: Marx expanded upon his ideas about the dictatorship of the proletariat in his short 1875 work, Critique of the Gotha Program, a scathing criticism and attack on the principles laid out in the programme of the German Workers' Party (predecessor to the Social Democratic Party of Germany). The programme presented a moderate gradualist, reformist and evolutionary way to socialism as opposed to revolutionary, violent approach of the orthodox Marxists. As a result, the latter accused the Gotha program as being revisionist and ineffective. Nevertheless, he allowed for the possibility of a peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as the case of Great Britain, the Netherlands and the United States), suggesting however that in other countries in which workers can not \\"attain their goal by peaceful means\\" the \\"lever of our revolution must be force\\", on the principle that the working people had the right to revolt if they were denied political expression.\\"You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries ‚Äì such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland ‚Äì where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means. This being the case, we must also recognise the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labour.\\" La Libert√© Speech delivered by Karl Marx on 8 September 1872, in Amsterdam Marx stated that in a proletarian-run society the state should control the \\"proceeds of labour\\" (i.e. all the food and products produced) and take from them that which was \\"an economic necessity\\", namely enough to replace \\"the means of production used up\\", an \\"additional portion for expansion of production\\" and \\"insurance funds\\" to be used in emergencies such as natural disasters. Furthermore, he believed that the state should then take enough to cover administrative costs, funds for the running of public services and funds for those who were physically incapable of working. Once enough to cover all of these things had been taken out of the \\"proceeds of labour\\", Marx believed that what was left should then be shared out amongst the workers, with each individual getting goods to the equivalent value of how much labour they had invested.Marx 1875. Chapter One. In this meritocratic manner, those workers who put in more labour and worked harder would get more of the proceeds of the collective labour than someone who had not worked as hard. In the Critique, he noted that \\"defects are inevitable\\" and there would be many difficulties in initially running such a workers' state \\"as it emerges from capitalistic society\\" because it would be \\"economically, morally and intellectually... still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges\\", thereby still containing capitalist elements. In other works, Marx stated that he considered the Paris Commune (a revolutionary socialism supporting government that ran the city of Paris from March to May 1871) as an example of the proletarian dictatorship. Describing the short- lived regime, he remarked: > The Commune was formed of the municipal councilors, chosen by universal > suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible, and revocable at > short terms. The majority of its members were naturally workers, or > acknowledged representatives of the working class. The Commune was to be a > working, not a parliamentary body, executive, and legislative at the same > time. This form of popular government, featuring revocable election of councilors and maximal public participation in governance, resembles contemporary direct democracy. = Friedrich Engels = Force and violence played an important role in Friedrich Engels's vision of the revolution and rule of proletariat. In 1877, arguing with Eugen D√ºhring, Engels ridiculed his reservations against use of force: In the 1891 postscript to The Civil War in France (1872) pamphlet, Engels said: \\"Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship looks like? Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the Proletariat\\"; to avoid bourgeois political corruption: > [...] the Commune made use of two infallible expedients. In this first > place, it filled all posts‚Äîadministrative, judicial, and educational‚Äîby > election on the basis of universal suffrage of all concerned, with the right > of the same electors to recall their delegate at any time. And, in the > second place, all officials, high or low, were paid only the wages received > by other workers. The highest salary paid by the Commune to anyone was 6,000 > francs. In this way an effective barrier to place-hunting and careerism was > set up, even apart from the binding mandates to delegates [and] to > representative bodies, which were also added in profusion. In the same year, he criticised \\"anti-authoritarian socialists\\", again referring to the methods of the Paris Commune: Marx's attention to the Paris Commune placed the commune in the centre of later Marxist forms. This statement was written in \\"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League\\", which is credited to Marx and Engels: Vladimir Lenin In the 20th century, Vladimir Lenin developed Leninism‚Äîthe adaptation of Marxism to the socio-economic and political conditions of Imperial Russia (1721‚Äì1917). This body of theory later became the official ideology of some Communist states. The State and Revolution (1917) explicitly discusses the practical implementation of \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" through means of violent revolution. Lenin denies any reformist interpretations of Marxism, such as the one of Karl Kautsky's. Lenin especially focused on Engels' phrase of the state \\"withering away\\", denying that it could apply to \\"bourgeois state\\" and highlighting that Engels work is mostly \\"panegyric on violent revolution\\". Based on these arguments, he denounces reformists as \\"opportunistic\\", reactionary and points out the red terror as the onlyThe supersession of the bourgeois state by the proletarian state is impossible without a violent revolution (The State and Revolution, Chapter 1) method of introducing dictatorship of the proletariat compliant with Marx and Engels work.\\"The theory of Marx and Engels of the inevitability of a violent revolution refers to the bourgeois state. The latter cannot be superseded by the proletarian state (the dictatorship of the proletariat) through the process of 'withering away\\", but, as a general rule, only through a violent revolution. The panegyric Engels sang in its honor, and which fully corresponds to Marx's repeated statements\\". (The State and Revolution, Chapter 1). In Imperial Russia, the Paris Commune model form of government was realised in the soviets (councils of workers and soldiers) established in the Russian Revolution of 1905, whose revolutionary task was deposing the capitalist (monarchical) state to establish socialism‚Äîthe dictatorship of the proletariat‚Äîthe stage preceding communism. In Russia, the Bolshevik Party (described by Lenin as the \\"vanguard of the proletariat\\") elevated the soviets to power in the October Revolution of 1917. Throughout 1917, Lenin argued that the Russian Provisional Government was unrepresentative of the proletariat's interests because in his estimation they represented the \\"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\\". He argued that because they continually put off democratic elections, they denied the prominence of the democratically constituted soviets and all the promises made by liberal bourgeois parties prior to the February Revolution remained unfulfilled, the soviets would need to take power for themselves. = Proletarian government = Lenin argued that in an underdeveloped country such as Russia the capitalist class would remain a threat even after a successful socialist revolution. As a result, he advocated the repression of those elements of the capitalist class that took up arms against the new soviet government, writing that as long as classes existed a state would need to exist to exercise the democratic rule of one class (in his view, the working class) over the other (the capitalist class). He said: The use of violence, terror and rule of single communist party was criticised by Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg and Mikhail Bakunin. In response, Lenin accused Kautsky of being a \\"renegade\\" and \\"liberal\\" and these socialist movements that did not support the Bolshevik party line were condemned by the Communist International and called social fascism in the early 1930s. Soviet democracy granted voting rights to the majority of the populace who elected the local soviets, who elected the regional soviets and so on until electing the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Capitalists were disenfranchised in the Russian soviet model. However, according to Lenin in a developed country it would be possible to dispense with the disenfranchisement of capitalists within the democratic proletarian dictatorship as the proletariat would be guaranteed of an overwhelming majority.Notes on Plenkhanov's Second Draft Programme. Lenin Collected Works. Vol. 6, p. 51. The Bolsheviks in 1917‚Äì1924 did not claim to have achieved a communist society. In contrast the preamble to the 1977 Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (the \\"Brezhnev Constitution\\"), stated that the 1917 Revolution established the dictatorship of the proletariat as \\"a society of true democracy\\" and that \\"the supreme goal of the Soviet state is the building of a classless, communist society in which there will be public, communist self-government\\".1977 Constitution of the USSR, Part 1. = Banning of opposition parties and factions = During the Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì1922), all the major opposition parties either took up arms against the new Soviet government, took part in sabotage, collaboration with the deposed Tsarists, or made assassination attempts against Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. When opposition parties such as the Cadets and Mensheviks were democratically elected to the Soviets in some areas, they proceeded to use their mandate to welcome in Tsarist and foreign capitalist military forces. In one incident in Baku, the British military, once invited in, proceeded to execute members of the Bolshevik Party (who had peacefully stood down from the Soviet when they failed to win the elections). As a result, the Bolsheviks banned each opposition party when it turned against the Soviet government. In some cases, bans were lifted. This banning of parties did not have the same repressive character as later bans under Stalin would.Marcel Leibman (1980) Leninism under Lenin Internally, Lenin's critics argued that such political suppression always was his plan. Supporters argued that the reactionary civil war of the foreign-sponsored White movement required it‚Äîgiven Fanya Kaplan's unsuccessful assassination of Lenin on 30 August 1918 and the successful assassination of Moisei Uritsky the same day. After 1919, the Soviets had ceased to function as organs of democratic rule as the famine induced by forced grain requisitions led to the Soviets emptying out of ordinary people. Half the population of Moscow and a third of Petrograd had by this stage fled to the countryside to find food and political life ground to a halt. The Bolsheviks became concerned that under these conditions‚Äîthe absence of mass participation in political life and the banning of opposition parties‚Äîcounter-revolutionary forces would express themselves within the Bolshevik Party itself (some evidence existed for this in the mass of ex opposition party members who signed up for Bolshevik membership immediately after the end of the Civil War). Despite the principle of democratic centralism in the Bolshevik Party, internal factions were banned. This was considered an extreme measure and did not fall within Marxist doctrine. The ban remained until the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991. In 1921, vigorous internal debate and freedom of opinion were still present within Russia and the beginnings of censorship and mass political repression had not yet emerged. For example, the Workers Opposition faction continued to operate despite being nominally dissolved. The debates of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued to be published until 1923. = Stalinism and dictatorship = Elements of the later censorship and attacks on political expression would appear during Lenin's illness and after his death, when members of the future Stalinist clique clamped down on party democracy among the Georgian Bolsheviks and began to censor material. Pravda ceased publishing the opinions of political oppositions after 1924 and at the same time, the ruling clique (Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Joseph Stalin) admitted large numbers of new members into the party in order to shout down the voices of oppositionists at party meetings, severely curtailing internal debate. Their policies were partly directed by the interests of the new bureaucracy that had accumulated a great deal of social weight in the absence of an active participation in politics by the majority of people. By 1927, many supporters of the Left Opposition began to face political repression and Leon Trotsky was exiled. Some modern critics of the concept of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\"‚Äîincluding various anti-communists, libertarian Marxists, anarcho- communists and anti-Stalinist communists and socialists‚Äîargue that the Stalinist Soviet Union and other Stalinist countries used the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" to justify the monopolisation of political power by a new ruling layer of bureaucrats, derived partly from the old Tsarist bureaucracy and partly created by the impoverished condition of Russia. However, the rising Stalinist clique rested on other grounds for political legitimacy rather than a confusion between the modern and Marxist use of the term \\"dictatorship\\". Rather, they took the line that since they were the vanguard of the proletariat, their right to rule could not be legitimately questioned. Hence, opposition parties could not be permitted to exist. From 1936 onward, Stalinist-inspired state constitutions enshrined this concept by giving the various communist parties a \\"leading role\\" in society‚Äîa provision that was interpreted to either ban other parties altogether or force them to accept the Stalinists guaranteed right to rule as a condition of being allowed to exist. This justification was adopted by subsequent communist parties that built upon the Stalinist model, such as the ones in China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba (initially the 26th of July Movement). = Post-Stalin = At the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev declared an end to the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" and the establishment of the \\"all people's government\\".

Only one was produced but the design led to the more successful Gerner G II R. Design and development The G.I was Max Gerner's first attempt at a popular two seat light aircraft which would be both robust and cheap to buy and maintain. It therefore had a metal girder frame and fabric covering; to keep the cost of purchase and repair down, he used standard sized steel tubing, welded together. It was a small single bay biplane with equal span, strongly staggered wings which were braced with slightly outward leaning N-form interplane struts and centrally supported by a pair of similar form cabane struts from wing spars to the upper fuselage longerons. In plan the wings were rectangular, with externally connected ailerons on both planes. Each single piece wing was built around two tubular spars with six cross members in the upper planes and four below. Edges and tips were defined by finer tubes, spot welded to the main structure; the trailing edges were formed by wire. To keep the cost low the G.I was powered by a three cylinder Anzani radial engine which produced about . It was air cooled, cowled with projecting cylinder heads, the upper one upright. Behind it the fuselage, also a tube steel structure, had a rectangular cross-section though with a lightly curved upper surface. The separate cockpits were in tandem with the forward one between the wings and covered over in some test flights; the rear seat, from which the aircraft was flown solo, was over the lower wing trailing edge, from where the stagger and a semicircular trailing edge cut-out assisted the pilot's upward view. The forward cockpit could be equipped with a second set of controls. The rear surfaces were straight edged, with constant chord and semicircular tips. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the elevators had a large cut-out for rudder movement, as the latter extended downwards to the keel. The fin was wire braced to both fuselage and tailplane. The G.I had a conventional undercarriage with two mainwheels and a tailskid. Originally each wheel was mounted on a V-shaped pair of struts and a half axle attached to a central frame. This proved weak and the half axles were therefore replaced by a conventional solid axle. Both wheels and skid had rubber shock absorbers. Operational history The G.I was built at Frankfurt airport, given the name Frankfurt and exhibited at the 1928 International Aviation Exhibition held in Berlin during October. The first flight was towards the end of 1928 but its low cost and ruggedness failed to attract much interest. Probably as a result Gerner's two partners, Behrens and Kuch, pulled out and Gerner set up his own company, Gerner Flugzeuge, at Frankfurt in the same year. The G.I was destroyed during an air race in September 1929.

The large stone church was built in a long church style around the year 1250 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 350 people.

Ullensvang is thus an old name. It is reasonable that Ullensvang had religious gathering place before the time of Christianity in Norway. When Christianity came to the area, it is likely that a church was built here where the old temple had stood. The earliest existing historical records of Ullensvang Church date back to the year 1309, but it is likely that the stone church was built between the years 1250‚Äì1300. Legend has it that the church was built by people from Scotland. Originally, the church had no tower, but the current tower was built between 1883 and 1885 during an expansion and renovation led by the architect Christian Christie. In 1958, the church was restored by the architect Arnstein Arneberg.

Based in the Garment District of New York City, Timo Weiland started as a neckwear collection and evolved into a full-range womenswear and menswear designer clothing line. History The men's and women's clothing line, Timo Weiland, was launched in 2010 after co-designers Weiland and Eckstein had joined together for a neckwear collection in 2009. Weiland graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2006 and moved to New York as an investment banking analyst for Deutsche Bank Securities. Having grown up with an interest in fashion after having learned how to sew from his mother he eventually met and collaborated with Fashion Institute of Technology students Alan Eckstein and Donna Kang in 2009. The designs exhibit an overall classic look with a \\"twist.\\" The Timo Weiland designers cite various sources for their design inspirations including a fictional trip that Keith Richards took with Gloria Vanderbilt to India in the 1960s. Other sources of inspiration for the fashion lines have included English Tudors architecture and upstate New York weekend getaways. In 2015, Timo Weiland announced its partnership with Project I, a boutique incubator company focused on early stage apparel companies. Project I, the brand's first outside investment, took a 25 percent minority investment. In 2016, the company was named the style director for Crowne Plaza and debuted a line of uniforms for the hotel chain. In 2017, the brand announced it would focus on direct-to-consumer sales. In the summer of 2019, Weiland, Kang, and Eckstein reunited the brand after each of the founders pursued their own fashion-related ventures. Fashion lines In 2011, Timo Weiland had its first runway show. Timo Weiland debuted its fashion lines for four seasons before introducing its first ready-to-wear line in spring 2013. Since then, it has produced three other ready-to-wear lines for fall 2013, spring 2014, and fall 2014. Timo Weiland has also done a pre-fall collection in 2013 and a resort collection in 2014. The label is sold at high-end stores such as Barneys New York and Takashimaya. Collaborations The designers at Timo Weiland have stated that collaborative efforts are great learning experiences for them in which one can see how a different company operates and how their creative processes work. Timo Weiland has participated in various collaborations with companies such as: Tsubo shoes, Topman/Topshop, Bing Bang jewelry with Anna Sheffield, Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and Banana Republic. In November 2016, the company partnered with Zenni Optical to open its first brick-and-mortar location in New York City. In 2017, Timo Weiland designed jackets for the EDM duo, The Chainsmokers, the brand said similar styles will be available later in the year. Awards and recognition When the Timo Weiland brand was launched, it was named one of the industry‚Äôs top 10 breakouts. The Timo Weiland designers were included in the 2012 Council of Fashion Designers of America's Incubator Program. The CFDA's Incubator Program includes 12 spots that are allotted to new and upcoming fashion designers. The program awards its participants with two years of coaching and collaboration in a New York-based office. The Timo Weiland label was one of the finalists for the International Woolmark Prize for 2013-2014. The label was nominated again for the 2014-2015 Woolmark prize. In 2014, Timo Weiland, Alan Eckstein and Donna Kang won the Ecco Domani Fashion Foundation Award for their Timo Weiland brand. The foundation annually recognizes emerging designers and winners of the award receive the opportunity to show their designs at New York's fall fashion week and are awarded a $25,000 grant. In 2016, the brand was awarded the first of six $75,000 CFDA x Cadillac grants and a retail spot lasting three months at Cadillac's global headquarters in New York City.

It is located in the village of Kinsarvik. It is the church for the Kinsarvik parish which is part of the Hardanger og Voss prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The gray stone church was built in a long church style around the year 1160 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 240 people. It is the oldest stone church in the whole Hardanger region, and at one time, it was one of the four main churches for all of the old Hordafylke county. History The first wooden church in all of Hardanger was built on this site around the year 1050. It was most likely a wooden church which was replaced by the present stone church around the year 1160. Remains of the previous church have been found under the present church. The foundation walls were built about wide. Archaeological investigations have found that there was a fire in the church, likely around the year 1180. This was around the time when the Birkebeiners ravaged Hordaland county as they were fighting for power. The church was originally built without a choir, and the choir was built after the fire, probably in the early 13th century. High up on the west gable is window opening leading into the church attic. It is probably here they have hoisted the local ship sails and masts to store during the winters.

The existing text of Mortimer His Fall, was printed in the 1640-1 edition of Jonson's complete works. The text comprises the \\"argument\\", or plot summary of the intended five acts, along with the complete first scene and part of the second. The complete scene is a soliloquy by Mortimer in which he is portrayed, \\"in the 'Machiavel' tradition\\", as a scheming villain. The fragmentary scene is the beginning of a dialogue between Mortimer and Queen Isabella.Irving Ribner, The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1957, p.292. Date Jonson's other historical tragedies were all written in the period 1602-4, and it has been argued that Mortimer may be identical to the play \\"Mortymore\\", referred to by Philip Henslowe in 1602, for which Henslowe provided \\"ij sewtes a licke\\" (two suits alike).Felix E. Schelling, The English Chronicle Play: A Study in the Popular Historical Literature Environing Shakespeare, Macmillan Company, New York, 1902, p.142. However, it is generally believed that the work was a very late one, left unfinished at his death in 1637.James Loxley, The Complete Critical Guide to Ben Jonson, Routledge, New York, 2001, p.99. The published version states \\"he dyed and left it unfinished\\". William Gifford described it as \\"the last draught of Jonson's quill\\".David Riggs, Ben Jonson: A Life, Harvard University Press, 1989, p.346. Style The play seems to have been an attempt to move away from the traditional chronicle history plays towards a more classical form, as it was intended to have included \\"choruses\\", such as \\"Ladyes celebrating the worthinesse of the Queene,\\" and \\"Countrey Justices and their Wives telling how they were deluded and made beleeve the old king lived.\\" Jonson's biographer David Riggs describes it as Jonson's attempt at a \\"final amalgamation of the classical and native tragedy\\". Content The play is set two years after the death of Edward II, when the young king Edward III begins to suspect the relationship between Mortimer and his mother. Over the course of the play, he learns the truth about what happened to his father and plans his revenge on Mortimer. The \\"argument\\" states: Mortimer is identified as a vainglorious figure whose pride is the cause of his actions. Mortimer's \\"Senecan pride and ambition\\" is expressed in his soliloquy in which he glories in his new power.

Rugby football began to be played in Sydney‚Äôs schools in the early 1860s. In the more than 150 years since, the game in New South Wales has grown to include more than 100,000 participants and the Rugby World Cup Final has been hosted in Sydney. History Reports of folk football being played in the Colony of New South Wales date from at least as early as 1829. Games were occasional and included matches played by soldiers at Sydney's barracks or against the crews of visiting ships. The rules were variable and negotiated by the players before each game. =Rugby beginnings= Football played under versions of the Rugby School rules was brought to Australia by Old Boys of the English public schools. Some settlers would have been familiar with earlier forms of the game even before it was formally codified at Rugby School in 1845. The Rugby code was introduced to schools in Sydney from the early 1860s. Players familiar with the game from the Sydney schools, along with increased arrivals from England and elsewhere, soon led to organised club football commencing in Sydney. Rugby games were being played at Sydney University in the 1860s. The first ‚Äòinter-club‚Äô rugby match took place during July 1865 between the Sydney Football Club and a team from the Australian Cricket Club. The game was intended to be played over three Saturdays but the newspapers of the time only report on the first two. The game was postponed after the second Saturday when the Sydney FC held a lead of two goals to one, but no record has been found of the final result. Newington College is credited with having a rugby club as early as 1869. From 1872 onwards there was a rapid growth in the formation of rugby football clubs. At a meeting of Sydney clubs on 22 June 1874, the Southern Rugby Football Union was formed as the governing body for rugby in New South Wales, and it was later renamed the New South Wales Rugby Union in 1892. New South Wales team, ca. 1883 New South Wales state team The New South Wales Waratahs team is the representative team of the NSWRU. The Waratahs have competed in the transnational Super Rugby competition since the start of the professional era of rugby in 1996. Competitions =Super Rugby= The New South Wales Waratahs play in the Super Rugby competition against other professional teams from Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina. The Waratahs team won the Super Rugby title for the first time in 2014, after having previously reached the final in 2005 and 2008. =National Rugby Championship= New South Wales has two teams in the National Rugby Championship: * New South Wales Country * Sydney =Shute Shield= Premiership Rugby is contested in Sydney across four senior grades and three colts competitions. Club Championship trophies are also contested on overall results. The Shute Shield is the trophy for the first grade premiership competition, and the eleven clubs currently competing for the premiership are: * Eastern Suburbs * Eastwood * Gordon * Manly * Northern Suburbs * Parramatta * Randwick * Southern Districts * Sydney University * Warringah * West Harbour Over the many years of competition for the NSW premiership, a number of formerly notable clubs became defunct. Some of the early ones include: Glebe (Australian Club Champions in 1908), Pirates, The Sydney Football Club (est. 1865), and Wallaroos. The Tooheys New Cup, which was the other recent first grade competition, ran from 2002 to 2006. An abbreviated Shute Shield competition was played in the latter part of the season during those years. When the Tooheys New Cup competition was disbanded, the Shute Shield competition was expanded again for the 2007 season. =Suburban rugby= Below the NSWRU grade competition is the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union (commonly known as Subbies). With over 6,000 players and 55 clubs this is believed to be the largest centrally organised rugby union competition in the world. =Country Rugby= The New South Wales Country Rugby Union is affiliated with the NSWRU and administers game in the majority of non- metropolitan areas of NSW. The union is split into nine zones with 100 clubs and over 16,000 players. NSW Country is represented by the New South Wales Country Cockatoos team. = Women's Rugby= Club competitions for women's 15-a-side teams are run in Sydney and Newcastle. A representative team from Sydney is regularly selected to play the NSW Country Corellas and the Australian Army women's team. The NSWRU also sends women's 15-a-side and 7-a-side representative teams to the ARU National Championships each year. The six clubs in the Sydney women's competition, as of 2014, are: *Parramatta Two Blues *Penrith Emus *Rockdale Rangers *Sydney University *Warringah Rugby Club *Waverley Rugby Club = Schoolboy Rugby= The Waratah Shield is a rugby union knock-out competition for high school teams from New South Wales, Australia.

It premiered on the Syfy channel on June 11, 2014, and stars Jeanette Samano, Sabi, Eric Ochoa, Ana Layevska, with Timothy DeLaGhetto and Fernando Allende. It also aired on the Chiller, mun2 and Telemundo networks and iTunes. It was produced by Fluency.  Plot  Isa Reyes (Jeanette Samano) is graduating from high school to study computer science when she is hit by a car. At the hospital, doctors find a foreign object inside her brain giving off a radio signal. That night, Isa dreams that she is being driven home by her deceased parents, and her mother tells her there was no accident. She wakes up inside the dream and breaks into a vault wherein she finds a golden cocoon. As Isa is dreaming, her phone is transmitting a radio signal to two engineers in Mexico who are monitoring her dream remotely. The engineers interpret Isa's dream as a break-in and reboot their system, causing Isa to wake up in pain. She's holding the very cocoon she dreamt about. A female scientist (Ana Layevska) reports the break-in to a shadowy banker (Fernando Allende), promising she will retrieve the chip that was used. The scientist sends a henchman, Borroso (Khotan Fern√°ndez), to track down the people Isa mentioned in her dream. When Borroso identifies the chip as belonging to a high school student, the scientist concludes that the computer break-in was done by \\"one of the children\\" upon which she has been experimenting. Borroso visits Isa's school and shows her a video that has been doctored to work as an evoked potential test for anyone implanted with the chip. Isa goes into a dream state in which her chip is activated and connects to the scientist's system. While the scientist observes her unconscious activity, Isa learns more about her true past in this dream by following a monarch butterfly back to Mexico. The scientist concludes that Isa was stolen from her lab when Isa was a child and that in the intervening years Isa's chip has become very powerful and could be quite lucrative to the banker. After Isa finds a photograph from her most recent dream on her phone, she confronts her adoptive aunt and uncle (Rebecca Manr√≠quez and Rub√©n Morales) who confess that they are not related and that she was smuggled into the U.S. as an infant by unknown migrants. Isa decides to run away having interpreted her dreams as containing the coordinates to her true home in Michoac√°n, Mexico. Borroso kidnaps Isa and plugs a cable into her head, allowing the scientist to download the evolved software in Isa's chip by forcing Isa to relive her worst nightmare. Isa manages to break out of the nightmare by interpreting it as a representation of her father who rescued her from the scientist's lab and sent her off with migrants to save her life. Isa wakes up inside Borroso's lair and disorients him by materializing a swarm of hundreds of monarch butterflies. Isa's friends (Eric Ochoa and Sabi) help her escape while the scientist is punished by the shadowy banker as a result of Isa's attack on their computer system which has triggered a large problem in the stock market.

Annalee Newitz of io9 says \\"What's terrific about Isa is that it's playing in the same thematic sandbox as other great works of contemporary science fiction, from Orphan Black to Ramez Naam's Nexxus series, but takes them in a new direction.\\" She goes on, \\"That's why we love this movie. It makes no apologies for having a female hero, and makes no big deal out of it, either. Ultimately it's about a group of characters, and how they function in a future world of brain implants and programmable minds.\\" Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times called Isa, a clever, bilingual film with \\"a good deal of poetry, and some subtextual resonance germane to the characters: about crossing borders, navigating different worlds; whether or not it was intended, it can handle the migration metaphors.\\" Susana Polo of The Mary Sue praised the film while also offering some critiques, \\"As is not always the case with dream-sequence-heavy movies, I found ISA's to have just the right mix of surreal creativity and calm mundanity. I itched to replay a Myst game as Isa solved each surreal dreamscape puzzle that lead her closer to unlocking the bad guys' secrets. So there's a lot to like about ISA, I just wish it hadn't been sorta slow and ultimately not particularly cohesive as a narrative.\\"  References   External links  * 2014 television films ","title":"Isa (film)"},{"id":"42977473","title":"Chongren Road station"},{"id":"42977477","text":"Jesse Bertrams (born 22 December 1994) is a Dutch professional football player who plays as a goalkeeper for Lommel.

Life  He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, from 1844 to 1850 with Christian Ruben (figurative painting) and Max Haushofer (landscape painting). In 1850, he went to D√ºsseldorf to continue his studies with Johann Wilhelm Schirmer. The following year, he began work in Prague as a theater decorator. In 1854, he married the actress and writer , daughter of the scenic designer Peter Anton Jaich (1804-1875). They had three sons, one of whom was Marxist theoretician Karl Kautsky. In 1863, he was appointed a decorative artist for the Vienna State Opera. The following year, he became a partner in the studios of Carlo Brioschi. Two years later, the Viennese Court Painter Hermann Burghart (1834-1901) was added to the partnership, creating the firm of \\"Brioschi, Burghart und Kautsky, k.u.k. Hoftheatermaler in Wien\\", which employed dozens of carpenters, blacksmiths, mechanics and clerks in addition to their painters; among whom were Georg Janny, , Ferdinand Brunner and Alfons Mucha. The studio received many orders from abroad as well as locally. Among their regular customers was the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Brioschi and Kautsky slowly gave up active participation in the firm, which was led by Burghart until his retirement in 1892. That same year, Kautsky bought out his partners and handed the company over to his sons, Hans and Fritz, who joined with the Italian painter and operated under the name \\"Kautskys S√∂hne und Rottonara\\".

Smart Pascal is a RAD (rapid application development) language, and ships with a substantial library of classes and pre-made components. The Smart Pascal compiler is an advanced source-to-source compiler generating rich, HTML5 compliant, server independent applications. Compiled Smart applications can be executed in any modern HTML5 capable browser. A compiled program is typically embedded within a DIV container element or alternatively set to occupy the entire display. The run-time library was specifically built for increased productivity and time-to-market with regards to mobile application development. Smart Pascal reduces development time for JavaScript radically linguistically, by means of Object Pascal and true object oriented programming, and with regards to how the run-time library's class and component system is designed. The RTL interacts with the document object model and JavaScript environment in the same way a native language would interact with an operative system; abstracting common denominators and automating complex tasks. Smart Pascal is also popular for micro-controller programming Espruino and nodeJS client/server modules.  Background  Smart Mobile Studio was designed by Norwegian Jon Lennart Aasenden and Frenchman Eric Grange. The technology is published by software company Optimale Systemer. The language uses a popular open-source scripting engine called Delphi Web Script (DWScript) for syntax verification and parsing. On 18 May 2012 Optimale Systemer disclosed that it had acquired the rights to a custom code generator written by Eric Grange, the maintainer of delphi web script, from his company Creative IT, France (see article: From OP4JS to Smart Mobile Studio). Prior to working with Eric Grange, Jon Lennart Aasenden had published several proposals where he outlined his thoughts for a new object pascal compiler; a compiler that would target Javascript and the browser as opposed to x86 or ARM processors. He also presented a video demonstrating an early prototype of the compiler (available on YouTube). He was initially met with heavy criticism from the Delphi and Free Pascal community, but found support in Eric Grange who verified and demonstrated that JavaScript had come of age - and could now be used to build large-scale, serious business applications. Jon Lennart wrote the Smart Pascal run-time library and integrated development environment while Eric Grange perfected the code generator and language improvements.  Prototype  The first prototype (alpha build) was released on 20 December 2011 and the duo quickly began to attract other programmers curious about the new platform. The project also received a full two-page coverage in Blaise Pascal Magazine (issue 31), which helped promote the dialect considerably. As a result, the run-time library and tools grew to include support for advanced technologies like Remobjects SDK and Embarcadero Datasnap - donated to the framework by software developer Andre Mussche. From version 2.0 Smart Pascal supported nodeJS, Web Workers and the Espruino micro-controller platform courtesy of German mathematician and developer Christian Budde. At the same time, technical author and software architect Primo≈æ Gabrijelƒçiƒç (author of the book Parallel Programming, among other titles) decided to write a book on Smart Pascal: A smart book, which for programming languages is often regarded as a stamp of approval. The dialect known as Smart Pascal grew out of the mutual co-operation between all these individuals.  Smart vs Flash  The Smart Pascal IDE has some similarities with Adobe Flash in that you essentially build object-oriented, high-speed, modular applications designed to live in a HTML document. The graphical capabilities of the Smart run-time library are more than up to the task of replicating some of the features Adobe Flash is famous for - but Smart Pascal is ultimately a toolkit for creating HTML5 mobile applications. There is very little in terms of visual automation provided by the Smart IDE. Smart Pascal was simply not designed to be a multimedia composer and remains a clear-cut HTML5 development platform for Object Pascal programmers. The learning curve for Smart Pascal is considerably higher than for Adobe ActionScript. Pascal is a language primarily used by engineers. Visual Smart Pascal applications are based on forms. Separate windows can be populated with controls, and code events can be connected to these to respond to user activity. Smart Mobile Studio does come with a visual form designer and property editor - but the designer is simply an aid for ordinary user-interfaces and lacks any support for visual effects. On the level of architecture, the Smart Pascal run-time library has full support for advanced graphical expressions, including dynamically created CSS3 styles, \\"tweening\\", display redraw synchronization, GPU powered 2D and 3D sprites and WebGL. One could say that Smart Pascal is \\"something like Flash\\", but that is where the parallel ends. Linguistically and conceptually these software methodologies are worlds apart. They were built for different things even though they can achieve much the same results. Smart Pascal has one advantage over Flash in that HTML5 applications have no dependencies. A Smart Pascal program does not rely on plugins, browser extensions or third party libraries. But Flash is ultimately more polished, representing over a decade of continuous evolution and multimedia excellence.  Smart vs. Typescript  Smart is able to import TypeScript libraries, but with some manual adaptation required. Typescript as a concept is very close to Smart Pascal. Both systems abstract the somewhat tedious labour of writing large-scale JavaScript applications; both systems introduce inheritance and object orientation to a platform that lacks all notions of class datatypes and VMT (virtual method table) execution. In this case Smart Pascal was created before TypeScript and has the upper hand technically, but just like with Adobe Flash, Smart Pascal and TypeScript represent ultimately two very different ideologies. TypeScript also benefits from a large userbase provided by Microsoft - where Smart Pascal is limited to Object Pascal Programmers. But both are capable of much the same.  Database access  The Smart pascal run-time library supports all the browser database engines in circulation. Access to these is achieved via classes rather than components, which breaks with how Object Pascal traditionally deals with data. As of this writing, the following engines are supported: * WebSQL * IndexedDB * WebStorage API The Smart IDE also imports and allows access to Embarcadero DataSnap, which is a remote-data-access framework popular with Delphi and C++ builder. Using these import libraries allows Smart Pascal applications to read, write and update remote datasets. Smart Pascal is itself written in Embarcadero Delphi. The run-time library includes classes for RemObjects SDK, a remote procedure call framework along the lines of Microsoft RPC. JSON RPC and WebSockets are likewise a part of the class library.  Linguistic differences  Smart Pascal has several differences that clearly separate the dialect from standard Object Pascal: * Property expressions * Array operations * Anonymous methods * Anonymous classes * Partial classes * Lambdas * Class variables * Limited sets support * Lack of generics * Limited RTTI = Property expressions = In Object Pascal a property is an exposed value that can either be linked to a class-field or a class-member method. This is the traditional way of exposing a value property, where the consumer of the property is abstracted from the reader and writer logic. The consumer does not know if the property is explicitly linked to a field or a writer method. Smart Pascal has full support for the older paradigm but introduces a technique called \\"property expressions\\". It basically allows you to program reader and writer logic as a part of property declarations. This is completely unheard of under traditional Object Pascal, but common in other languages like C# and Objective-C. In classical Object Pascal you could write something like this: Type TMyObject = Class( .. ) private FSubObj: TNameData; protected function getFirstName:String; procedure setFirstName(value:String); published Property FirstName:String read getFirstName write setFirstName; end; function TMyObject.getFirstName:String; begin result:=FSubObj.FirstName; end; procedure TMyObject.setFirstName(value:String); begin FSubObj.FirstName:=Value; end; Using Smart Pascal with property expressions, you can omit the getFirstName() and setFirstName() stubs - and implement the logic as part of the property declaration itself: Property FirstName:String read ( FSubObject.FirstName ) write ( FSubObject.FirstName ); Property expressions is especially handy for classes with child objects. If a class exposes sub objects (object lists) you had, prior to generics, to write a lot of the same code over and over again, wrapping already existing code in a list object‚Äîwhich for complex class hierarchies reduces execution speed with unnecessary bloat. This has changed for the better with the introduction of generics, but you still have to isolate reader and writer logic in distinct class members. Under Smart Pascal this is elegantly achieved using arrays: TMyClass = class private FList : array of TElement; public property Items[i: Integer] : TElement read (FList[i]) write (FList[i]); default; property Count : Integer read (FList.Length); end; The technique greatly simplifies number conversion, which can in some cases be done directly in the declaration: TMyAngle = record private FAngle : Float; public property Radians : Float read FAngle write FAngle; property Degrees : Float read (RadToDeg(FAngle)) write (FAngle:=DegToRad(Value)); end; = Array operations = Array operations were added to the Smart Pascal syntax to better adapt to JavaScript. Since JavaScript has no concept of pointers or direct memory access, all attempts at dealing with lists, linked lists etc. in the traditional way would cause a massive speed penalty. So where you under Delphi or Free Pascal would allocate a TList or TObjectList instance - Smart Pascal achieves better performance and identical functionality using ordinary arrays. All arrays support a complete set of operations, regardless of datatype, for inserting, removing, sorting and otherwise manipulate the content. Where under vanilla Object Pascal you would write: Procedure TMyObject.AddItem(aValue:Integer); var mLen: Integer; Begin mLen:=length(FMyArray); setLength(FMyArray,mLen +1); FMyArray[mLen]:=Vaue; end; Smart Pascal has this functionality \\"built-in\\" for all arrays, as long as the datatypes match. When you combine this with property expressions, the result is a powerful and alternative way of achieving the same with less resources and more speed than generics or traditional Object Pascal: FMyArray.add(aValue); As of this writing, the following operations can be performed on all array types: * Add * Clear * Copy * Count * Delete * High * Low * IndexOf * Insert * Length * Map * Peek * Pop * Push * Remove * Reverse * SetLength The Peek(), Pop(), Push() method are typically used with FILO (first in, last out) and FIFO (first in, first out) stack objects. Smart Pascal has no need for classes like TObjectlist, TList, TStringlist and TStack (these are provided by the run-time library for legacy support with Delphi's Visual Component Library only). = Anonymous methods = Like property expressions and array operations, anonymous methods was introduced in Smart Pascal as a means to improve compatibility with JavaScript. Both Delphi and Free Pascal support anonymous methods, but Smart Pascal has one advantage over these native compilers. Under native Pascal (compilers that produce executable machine code), you have class procedures and ordinary procedures. The only difference between these two is that if you want to reference the first (class method) you must postfix the declaration with \\"of object\\". This way of referencing a class method is typically used for event declarations. An event is declared thus in ordinary Object Pascal: Type TMyEventType = procedure (sender:TObject;const value:Integer) of object; If you omit the \\"of object\\" postfix, the reference can only be used on procedures and functions on unit level. The compiler does not allow you to reference an object method without \\"of object\\" being clearly defined. Smart Pascal does not have this distinction. There is no \\"of object\\" in the Smart dialect; anonymous methods can be applied on a wider scale than under native Object Pascal, including object based events and callback handlers. Under Smart Pascal the example below is perfectly valid and compiles without any problems: Constructor TMyPanel.Create(AOwner:TW3Component); Begin Inherited Create(AOwner); FiPhoneHeader:=TW3HeaderControl.Create(self); FiPhoneHeader.Backbutton.onClick := Procedure (sender:TObject) Begin w3_callback( procedure () begin showmessage('You clicked the back button 2 seconds ago'); end, 2000); end; end; = Anonymous classes = In traditional Object Pascal, all classes inherit from a root type called TObject. This was also the case for Delphi Web Script, from which Smart Pascal evolved. To better be able to import classes written in Javascript‚Äîwhich is extremely important to providing full support for the DOM (document object model) and the full spectrum of JavaScript modules‚Äîdependency on TObject as the root of all class types had to be altered. Eric Grange introduced anonymous classes in Smart Pascal starting from version 1.0, which meant that Smart Pascal was now able to directly import and make use of external classes. This allows the user to simply define a class as external, and classes written in JavaScript that match the interface can thus be created and used alongside those written in Pascal. This is achieved by allowing objects to be rooted from nothing (i.e.: no pre-defined constructor logic and behavior). JCustomEventInit = class external 'CustomEventInit' (JEventInit) detail : Variant end; JEventTarget = class external 'EventTarget' procedure addEventListener(aType : String; callback : JEventListener; capture : Boolean = false); procedure removeEventListener(aType : String; callback : JEventListener; capture : Boolean = false); function dispatchEvent(event : JEvent) : Boolean; end; Anonymous classes can also be used as lightweight objects (without the external keyword), more akin to records (custom datatypes in other languages) since it does not include the life-cycle management provided by TObject. = Partial classes = Partial classes is yet a feature that has not made it into the Object Pascal standard. It basically means that the full declaration and implementation of a class or record type can be spread over multiple source- files. You can also pre-compile one part while you leave the other part open for implementation by others. This is the case for Mono C# under iOS for instance, where the pre-compiled application controller is expected to be completed by the framework user. Partial classes is a very helpful feature when deployed with care. It is especially handy for large class hierarchies that target different models. Depending on the model set by the programmer, the implementation of certain features differs according to the source-files included. Smart Pascal supports two declaration formats of partial classes. The RemObjects Oxygene Pascal syntax, and also the more intuitive \\"type mytype = partial class(ancestor type)\\" variation. Partial classes are used throughout the Smart Pascal run-time library: TW3CustomControl = partial class(TW3MovableControl) private FAngle: Float; FScrollInfo: TW3ScrollInfo; FClassNames: TW3CSSClassStyleNames; FFont: TW3ControlFont; ... ... = Lambdas = Lambdas is an extremely handy feature that, like partial and anonymous classes, is not yet a part of classical object pascal. The Smart Pascal syntax supports several kind of lambdas, which is pretty handy when writing asynchronous code. For instance, the following closure: var repeater := TW3EventRepeater.Create( function (Sender: TObject): boolean begin Result := MyFunction; end, 5000); may be written with a lambda: var repeater := TW3EventRepeater.Create(lambda => MyFunction, 5000); Lambda statements (i.e. \\"procedure\\" kind of closures) can be written as such: btnOK.OnClick := lambda Application.HideModal(mrOK); end; = Class variables = Class variables basically means that you can define a variable (or multiple variables) in a class that can be altered regardless of an instance construction. This is a handy technique for setting conditions before an object is created from the class prototype. TMyClass = Class(TObject) Public var driverMode:Integer; End; TMyClass.driverMode:=1200; = Limited sets support = In Pascal, a set is a collection of elements of same type. The Smart Pascal syntax currently supports only sets of enumerations, with the \\"in\\" operator, and \\"include(aSet, aValue)\\" or \\"exclude(aSet, aValue)\\" methods. type TMySet = set of (msFirst,msSecond,msThird); var MySet: TMySet; begin // populate set with two states MySet := [msFirst,msThird]; if msFirst in MySet then writeln('First'); exclude(MySet,msFirst); if msFirst in MySet then writeln('Never Shown'); end; = Lack Of Generics = Smart Pascal does not support generics. The original syntax of Delphi Web Script Smart Pascal derives from was compatible with Delphi 7. Although the DWScript codebase and language has evolved considerably over the past six years, generics represents a monumental change that might require a complete re-write of the entire parser and AST (\\"abstract symbolic tree\\" in compiler science) technology. Lack of generics is tempered by two features of the language: * Powerful array support (a convenient replacement to \`TList\`); * \`class of\` types can be used to instantiate a given \`class\` instance at runtime (just as with regular object pascal). = Limited RTTI = Run-time type information is in-part supported by DWScript, including the ability to enumerate properties and class members. RTTI is implemented by the Smart Pascal JavaScript compiler, if the \\"Emit RTTI information\\" is defined in the Project's Compiler options. Currently only published properties are part of this information. Once activated, the following class: type TBase = class published Field : Integer = 1; end; will emit the following RTTI JavaScript object: var $RTTI = [ { T: {ID:TBase}, A: { ClassType: RTTIPropertyAttribute, N: \\"Field\\", T: {ID:Number}, C: 3, G: function (s) { return s.Field }, S: function (s,v) { s.Field=v } } } ]; Then you can access this information from code, as described in this article.  Consensus  Smart Pascal is often regarded as a powerful oddity in the world of object pascal. Even though the language supports nearly every syntax feature defined by Embarcadero Delphi, it often breaks or expands on the syntax to introduce radical but effective solutions, that make it more useful for asynchronous programming. As such it promotes concepts borrowed from both JavaScript and Objective-C, mixed with elements from C++, C# and Smalltalk. The result is a flexible and dynamic flavor of Object Pascal that greatly simplifies server-less HTML5 JavaScript development. Powerful as the dialect is, many traditional Object Pascal programmers regard Smart as a hybrid language, the common objection being that Smart promotes features somewhat alien to the established principles of Object Pascal. Smart supporters argue that this new dialect is necessary for modern software development, and that this is exactly what Object Pascal needs in order to evolve and adapt - pointing to generics as a recent paradigm shift. As such, the supporters argue that the new language does not pose a threat to the long established syntax, but enriches it with proven techniques from more modern languages.

Severely wounded during the Siege of Petersburg in 1864, he was recognized for his meritorious service less than eight months later with his nation's highest award for bravery, the U.S. Medal of Honor, for capturing the enemy's flag while serving as captain of Company D of the 157th Pennsylvania Infantry during the Battle of Five Forks, Virginia on April 1, 1865. That award was conferred on April 27, 1865. Formative years Born in Valley Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania on August 31, 1832 (alternate birth year: 1835), John Wallace Scott was a son of Pennsylvania natives Samuel Scott (1807‚Äì1884), a farmer, and Jane B.

Promoted to the rank of corporal early during his tenure of service, he and his men captured two enemy supply wagons while assigned to picket duties along an Annapolis Railroad line in Virginia in August 1861. Drawn by two horses each, the wagons were loaded with $5,000 worth of gold bullion and silk slated for use in CSA military uniforms and flags, as well as quinine supplies destined for CSA physicians. Engaged with his regiment in the Seven Days Battles near Richmond, Virginia from June 25 to July 1, 1862, including the battles of Beaver Dam Creek (June 26), Gaines's Mill (June 27), Savage's Station (June 29), Glendale (June 30), and Malvern Hill (July 1), he then fought in the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28‚Äì30), and the battles of South Mountain (September 14) and Antietam (September 17).

He played for his hometown school, the University of Dayton, through his freshman year at college. Staten later led West Virginia in points, assists, field goal percentage, and steals during the 2013‚Äì14 season. High school career Staten was known as one of the better athletes coming out of Oak Hill Academy, a school that is famed for producing several excellent basketball players. He helped the Warriors claim the best ranking in the state with a perfect undefeated home record. During his junior year, Staten represented Thurgood Marshall High School, whom he also led to an exceptional record along with tremendous success in the state tournament. At the end of his years in high school, the Ohio native was approached by several different schools around the country including Xavier, Purdue, Dayton, and Cincinnati. } College career As a freshman at Dayton in 2010‚Äì11, Staten led the conference in assists. The Flyers finished the regular season with a winning record and reached the finals through the Atlantic 10 Tournament. In 2011, Staten transferred to West Virginia and subsequently sat out the 2011‚Äì12 season due to the NCAA transfer rules. His first season with Bob Huggins and the West Virginia Mountaineers resulted in his least successful year up till then. Staten started 21 of thirty-one season contests. Perhaps his most considerable moment was when the point guard made a game-winning shot against Virginia Tech with about five seconds on the clock. Staten's junior season drew attention of the media immediately. He led the team under about every \\"point guard\\" category and proved to be an excellent rebounder as well. The Ohio native earned prestigious conference honors with West Virginia, such as the Big 12 First Team and the Big 12 All-Defensive Team in 2014. At the conclusion of the year, Staten averaged 18.1 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.6 rebounds, making him one of the nation's top point guards statistically. As a senior in 2014‚Äì15, he averaged 14.2 points and 4.6 assists in 30 games. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2015 NBA draft, Staten joined the Sacramento Kings for the 2015 NBA Summer League. He managed just one game for the Kings due to left knee soreness. On September 25, 2015, Staten signed with the Golden State Warriors. However, he was later waived by the Warriors on October 16 after appearing in one preseason game. On November 2, he was acquired by the Santa Cruz Warriors of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of Golden State. Staten played in 13 games for Santa Cruz, where he averaged 8.9 points and 3.7 assists in 29 minutes per game. On December 31, he was traded to the Delaware 87ers in exchange for a 2016 fifth-round pick. On February 23, he was waived by Delaware. On March 29, he was reacquired by the 87ers, however, he left the team on April 5 and signed with Belfius Mons- Hainaut of the Belgian League. For the 2016‚Äì17 season, he joined Vilpas Vikings of the Finnish Korisliiga. Staten and the Vikings ended the season as runners-up of the Korisliiga, losing to Kataja BC in the Finals. Staten was named the league's Most Valuable Foreign Player, after averaging 13.3 points and 4.3 assists per game over the season. For the season 2017‚Äì2018, he joined Saint-Chamond (France Pro B). He reached the playoffs with the team. During the season he played an average of 27 minutes for 11,2pts 2rbs and 3,6 assists. He played with his slasher and explosive style. Personal life Staten was born on May 19, 1992, in Dayton, Ohio to Billy and Cecilia Staten.

He wrote nine operas, four cantatas, numerous piano pieces and songs as well as a limited amount of chamber music. Life O'Kelly, the first child of the Dublin-born piano teacher Joseph Kelly (1804‚Äì1856) and his wife Marie Duval (1803‚Äì1889), was born as Joseph Toussaint Kelly on 29 January 1828 in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Of his four brothers, two also became notable musicians: the music publisher Auguste O'Kelly (1829‚Äì1900) and the composer and pianist George O'Kelly (1831‚Äì1914). Around 1835 the family moved to Paris, where they lived at various addresses in the Faubourg Poissonni√®re area of the 9th arrondissement. Joseph received his early musical training from his father. As a foreign national he was not allowed to attend the Paris Conservatoire, instead he continued his education on the piano with George Alexander Osborne (1806‚Äì1893) (before 1844) and Fr√©d√©ric Kalkbrenner (1785‚Äì1849) (mid-1840s) and in composition with Victor Dourlen (1780‚Äì1864) and Fromental Hal√©vy (1799‚Äì1862).F.-J. F√©tis: Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie g√©n√©rale de la musique. Supplement et complement, Arthur Pougin (ed.) (Paris: Firmin-Didot & Cie., vol. II, 1880), p. 286-7. Attention: contains mistakes! His earliest published compositions date from 1847. He has always used the name O'Kelly in his public appearances, although the official change of name from Kelly to O'Kelly did not occur before January 1859 when all brothers O'Kelly took this step simultaneously before a 'Tribunal Civil' in Boulogne-sur-Mer.Copy in Archives Municipales, Boulogne-sur-Mer Until 1855, his vocal output consisted exclusively of salon romances; after a break in vocal writing he returned in the 1860s with a series of settings of poems by Victor Hugo. In these considerably more ambitious pieces he dispenses with a strophic structure, employs more dramatic development and some technically advanced piano writing. His music for piano solo is altogether more ambitious and was influenced not only by his piano teachers Osborne and Kalbrenner, but also by Field, Berlioz and particularly Chopin, whom he greatly admired. With influences such as these, O'Kelly did not belong to the modernists in French music, which contributed to his early neglect. Nevertheless, his music is always tastefully written, technically demanding and rewarding for performers. Throughout his life O'Kelly showed a keen interest in opera. All of his nine operas are one- act comic operas, four of which were published. Stella (1859) was expressly written as a salon op√©rette, but his best-known works were La Zingarella (1878, libretto by Jules Adenis and Jules Montini), performed in February and March 1879 at the Op√©ra Comique in Paris,Le M√©nestrel, 2 March 1879, p. 107; Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris, 2 March 1879, p. 66-7 & numerous other reviews researchable via Gallica and La Barbi√®re improvis√©e (1882, libretto by Paul Burani and Jules Montini), performed in April and May 1884 at the Bouffes-Parisiennes.Le Gaulois, 3 May 1884, p. 3; L'Europe Artiste, 7 September 1884, p. 3; Le Parnasse, 1 January 1885, p. 4 Of his four cantatas, the first, Paraguass√∫ (1855, Th√©√¢tre Lyrique), was the most extended piece, dealing with a 16th-century episode from Brazil, for which he was awarded with the Knighthood of the Order of the Rose by the Brazilian emperor Don Pedro II. The third, the Cantate des Irlandais de France au Centenaire d'O'Connell, to words by another Franco-Irishman, the Viscount O'Neill de Tyrone, was performed in excerpts at the O'Connell Centenary in Dublin in 1875 ‚Äì the only instance when O'Kelly visited Ireland.The Irish Times, 10 August 1875, p. 6; The Nation, 14 August 1875, p. 13 The fourth, Justice et Charit√© (1878) was a commission to celebrate the renovation of the chapel at the Castle of Versailles.Journal des d√©bats, 13 June 1878, p. 3 Although O'Kelly never assumed French citizenship, according to J.P. Leonard, he \\"didn't speak a word of English\\".See J.P. Leonard's obituary 'Death of an Eminent Franco-Irish Composer' in The Nation, 31 January 1885, p. 5 Yet he clearly identified himself as Irish: the change of name in 1859 is one proof for it, but he was also a member of the 'Anciens Irlandais' community of Irishmen in France and composed works relating to Ireland such as the Mac-Mahon Marche op. 41 (1871) and an Air irlandais op. 58 (1877). He also dedicated several of his works to members of the Irish community in Paris. Besides the 1859 award from Brazil, O'Kelly was also decorated with Portugal's national order of merit, the Order of Christ (in 1865)Le M√©nestrel, 26 November 1865, p. 414 and became a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1881.Gil Blas, 12 January 1881, p. 4; Le M√©nestrel, 16 January 1881, p. 54 Joseph O'Kelly died of bowel cancer on 9 January 1885 in Paris, in the apartment of his brother George in the 17th arrondissement.

He is a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and as a lawyer he is known for working on behalf of Native Americans. He was, from June 2014 to January 2017, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. Early life and education Although a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, Harper did not grow up in Oklahoma, due to his father being in the military and posted elsewhere. Harper's forebears include David Rowe, an Assistant Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation who was elected as a judge of the Northern Judicial Circuit shortly after the Civil War. Harper attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated in 1990 with a B.A. in sociology and psychology. He then went to the New York University School of Law, where he graduated with a J.D. in the class of 1994. There he served as an editor on the New York University Journal of International Law and Politics. He was admitted to the New York bar the following year. Legal career After law school, Harper served as a law clerk to Judge Lawrence W. Pierce of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He considered it a formative experience with Pierce becoming one of his role models. He also worked early in his career for the New York firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell. Harper was a litigator at the Native American Rights Fund for eleven years spanning from 1995 to 2006. He is most known for his work in the Cobell v. Kempthorne, a large class-action lawsuit brought by Native American representatives against two departments of the United States government. The case was brought in 1996 on behalf of upwards of 500,000 Native Americans, and was resolved in 2009 with the Obama administration agreeing to a $3.4 billion settlement. He also did some teaching: as an adjunct professor at the Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law from 1998 to 2001, and as a professorial lecturer at the American University Washington College of Law from 1999 to 2001. He then became a partner at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, in Washington, D.C., where he focused his practice on litigation and Native American affairs, representing tribes and individual Indians. With the new firm, Harper continued his work as a lead attorney on Cobell, and by the 2010s the lawyers on that case had earned over $85 million in attorneys' fees. The high payments became an issue among some Native Americans, and during 2010‚Äì2011 Harper toured Indian country to defend the settlement terms and the payments to attorneys. Harper was also accused by some other Native American lawyers of using physical intimidation tactics in several cases in the mid- late 2000s during disagreements over Cobell matters. Harper has also served on the bench: as a justice of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe's Appellate Court from 2001 to 2007, and following that as a justice of the Supreme Court of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians from 2007 to 2008. Political involvement Harper acted as a key liaison between the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008, and Indian tribes. In 2010, Harper was mentioned as a possible pick for the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In 2011, President Obama named him to a spot on the President's Commission on White House Fellowships. Harper worked on the re-election Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012, and helped bring in over $500,000 in donations. He personally helped host a conference and two major fundraisers for the campaign. As such, Harper was considered a \\"mega-bundler\\" who played a major role in setting overall record levels of campaign donations for Obama from Native Americans. On July 11, 2017, Harper endorsed Deb Haaland for Congress.https://www.facebook.com/DebforCongress/photos/a.1378589052385689.1073741831.1375618656016062/1911512889093300/?type=3&hc;_ref=OTHER&pnref;=story Haaland ran in New Mexico's first congressional district and won, becoming one of the two first Native American woman elected to Congress, alongside Sharice Davids. U.S. Ambassador Harper was nominated by President Obama for the position of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council on June 10, 2013. Many human rights advocates were unfamiliar with Harper, and as such the pick reflected a long-standing practice of presidents rewarding top supporters with ambassadorships and similar postings. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered his nomination in two rounds of confirmation hearings, in September 2013 and February 2014. A number of Republicans objected to the nomination, either because of his earnings or tactics during the Cobell case or because of his role in Obama campaign fundraising. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who led the arguments against Harper, said, \\"Mr. Harper is just another example of a campaign bundler wholly ill-suited to serve in the diplomatic post for which he's been nominated.\\" Senator Jon Tester of Montana said, on the other hand, that \\"As a longtime advocate for the civil rights of Native Americans, Keith will be a great Ambassador for our country.\\" While many Native American groups supported Harper's nomination, some indigenous rights advocates were wary of it, saying that Harper had shown a lack of substantial positions on Indian human rights issues throughout his legal career. Eventually, Harper was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 3, 2014, nearly a year after his nomination, in a party-line 52‚Äì42 vote with Democrats supporting and Republicans opposed. As such he benefited from the \\"nuclear option\\" adopted in the Senate the year before, where Senate filibusters could no longer be used against such appointees. Harper thus became the first person from a federally recognized Native American tribe to achieve the rank of U.S. ambassador. Harper was sworn into his position by June 5, 2014, and immediately flew to Geneva for a Human Rights Council meeting. Harper's tenure in the position ended with the change of administrations in Washington in January 2017. Return to law practice In February 2017, Harper returned to practice as a partner at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, in Washington, D.C. on Native American affairs and international matters. Jenner & Block hired Harper in July 2020.  Awards and honors The National Law Journal selected Harper as one of 50 \\"Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America\\" in May 2008. *He is listed in the 2013 and the four years immediately preceding editions of Chambers USA: America's Leading Lawyers for Business. *Harper was recognized in The Best Lawyers in America for Native American Law in 2013 and the five years immediately preceding. *He is listed as a 2010, 2012 and 2013 Washington D.C. \\"Super Lawyer\\" in Native American Law by Super Lawyers magazine. *Diversity & The Bar magazine selected Harper as one of 14 minority \\"Rainmakers\\". *In 2001, he was selected as a Leadership Conference on Civil Rights delegate to the World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa.

[Gale Virtual Reference Library]. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/, Document Number CX2469854893  Major contributions  Jacoby's work has to do with human memory, and most of it has emphasized episodic memory (that is, the processes and mechanisms that enable us to remember our own past experiences). His early work was in the verbal learning tradition. Jacoby's first publication, in a now-defunct publication of the Psychonomic Society, was McHose, Jacoby, and Meyer 1967. Jacoby published steadily throughout the 1970s, producing a number of works that have attracted multiple citations, such as a 1978 article on how, when a problem is repeated, a person may solve it by remembering the prior solution. = Attributional approach to remembering = In the 1980s, a major theme in Jacoby's work was that the feeling of remembering does not inhere in the use of memory traces. As he noted, one can use memory records of specific past episodes without having a subjective feeling of remembering (as in involuntary plagiarism) and one can have a subjective feeling of remembering without there being any directly corresponding prior episode and hence no directly corresponding memory trace (as in false-memory phenomena). Jacoby argued that the feeling of remembering arises when a person infers (usually very quickly and without conscious reflection) that current thoughts and images are based on memories of a prior episode ‚Äì that is, when people attribute current mental events to the past. For a beautifully written and compelling synthesis of Jacoby's work on this perspective, see his 1989 chapter with Colleen Kelley and Jane Dywan in a book in honour of Endel Tulving coedited by Roediger and Craik. In his work with Kelley, he made a distinction between memory that influences performance (he called it \\"memory as a tool\\"), which is implicit or unconscious memory outside our awareness, and recollection memory (he called it \\"memory as an object\\"), which is conscious memory of an event. = Logic of opposition = Jacoby is renowned for his methodological creativity and prowess. Jacoby's ‚Äúlogic of opposition‚Äù is a particularly lovely methodological innovation. Psychologists have long sought to demonstrate influences of unconscious, automatic processes. A problem is that it is difficult to ensure that responses are not being influenced by conscious processes.Merikle, P.M., & Reingold, E.M. (1992). Measuring unconscious perceptual processes. In R.F. Bornstein & T.S. Pittman (Eds.), Perception without awareness (pp. 55-80). New York: Guilford Publications.Reingold, E.M., & Merikle, P.M. (1990). On the inter-relatedness of theory and measurement in the study of unconscious processes. Mind & Language, 5, 9-28. doi:10.1111/j.1468-0017.1990.tb00150.x For example, a brief prior exposure to a made-up name (e.g., Sebastian Weisdorf) might later lead people taking a test in which they judge names as famous versus nonfamous to mistake that name as famous. That could be an unconscious phenomenon ‚Äì the subject simply experiences the name as famous and does not recollect the prior encounter with the name. But maybe instead the subject remembers the name from the earlier list and assumes that some or all of the names on that list were of famous people. That is, both unconscious and/or conscious uses of memory for the study-list encounter with ‚ÄúSebastian Weisdorf‚Äù could influence subjects toward endorsing that name as famous. The same problem crops up in a wide range of attempts to demonstrated unconscious influences. The logic of opposition puts conscious awareness in opposition to being influenced. One way to do this is simply to correctly inform subjects (in the case of this fame procedure) that all of the names on the study list were non-famous. Thus if a subject recollects that a name was on the study list, s/he can confidently identify it as non-famous. Jacoby, Woloshyn, and Kelley (1989) found that when subjects had studied the list with full attention, these opposition instructions led them to be less likely to endorse studied names as famous than to endorse non- studied names as famous. That shows (a) that they sometimes recognized names on the fame test as names on the study list and (b) that they understood that names on the study list were nonfamous. The cool finding was that subjects who studied the list of names under divided attention more often called studied names famous than non-studied names. Presumably dividing attention at study impaired subject ability to consciously recollect which names had been on the list, but left intact more automatic, unconscious influences of familiarity. = Process dissociation procedure = The logic of opposition proved a very valuable methodological tool in a variety of different settings.Lindsay, D.S. (1990). Misleading suggestions can impair eyewitnesses' ability to remember event details. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 16(6), 1077-1083. doi:10.1037/0278-7393.16.6.1077Vokey, J.R., & Higham, P.A. (2004). Opposition logic and neural network models in artificial grammar learning. Consciousness and Cognition, 13, 565-578. doi:10.1016/j.concog.2004.05.008 It also formed a key stepping stone in Jacoby's subsequent development of the ‚Äúprocess dissociation procedure‚Äù (PDP), which Jacoby introduced in a 1991 article in Journal of Memory and Language that became a citation classic. The PDP is a method for obtaining separate quantitative estimates of the concurrent contributions of two different sources of influence on task performance (e.g., conscious vs. unconscious perception; habit vs. intention; familiarity vs. recollection). For decades cognitive psychologists used individual tasks to measure specific procedures. For example, a recognition memory test might be used to index ‚Äúexplicit‚Äù or consciously guided uses of memory whereas a fragment-completion test might be used to index ‚Äúimplicit‚Äù or unconscious influences of memory. As Jacoby pointed out, there have been endless problems caused by the fact that tasks are not process-pure. For example, unconscious influences of memory can affect responses on a recognition test, and conscious recollection can affect responses on a fragment completion task. Jacoby presumed that many tasks are influenced by both controlled and automatic processes. To index them, he compared (a) performance when controlled and automatic influences would affect responding in the same direction with (b) performance when controlled influences would oppose the effects of automatic influences. Using simple algebraic equations and certain assumptions, Jacoby derived estimates of the two underlying categories of influence. The process dissociation procedure was not without its critics (e.g.,Curran, T., & Hintzman, D. L. (1995). Violations of the independence assumption in process dissociation. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21, 531-547. doi:10.1037/0278-7393.21.3.531Curran, T., & Hintzman, D. L. (1997).

Jacoby and former student Andy Yonelinas provided an update on the status of the PDP in a 2012 article.  Recent work  Jacoby's recent work has explored various aspects of the notion of cognitive control‚Äîways the mind/brain constrains its own operation so as to enhance the production of some kinds of mental contents relative to others. One key notion is that control can often be exercised ‚Äúat the front end‚Äù and thereby modulate the thoughts and images that come to mind (whereas most prior theorizing about control emphasized output monitoring and filtering) (e.g., Halamish, Goldsmith, & Jacoby, 2012; Jacoby, Shimizu, Daniels, & Rhodes, 2005). Another key notion is that the ability to modulate cognitive control develops across childhood and then, late in life, declines, thereby leading to aging-related memory failures (e.g., Jacoby, Rogers, Bishara, & Shimizu, 2012; Jennings & Jacoby, 2003). Jacoby's recent work with postdoc Chris Wahlheim has explored the positive effects of noticing and remembering change on forgetting caused by interference (e.g., Jacoby, Wahlheim, & Kelley, 2015); cf.Hintzman, D. L. (2011). Research strategy in the study of memory: Fads, fallacies, and the search for the 'coordinates of truth.

Harris House (also known as the Parrish Place) is a two- story Italianate-style home located at 101 East Burton street in Kirksville, Missouri. A modified \\"T-plan\\" Victorian home constructed in 1875, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1973. History Captain Thomas C. Harris was an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. A native of New York, he settled in Kirksville shortly after the conclusion of the war, and was engaged in a succession of woolen mills in the town and vicinity. In 1875 Harris began construction of a large two-story brick home on what was then the northern edge of Kirksville. There is some doubt as to whether Harris ever lived in the home, and for how long, as it was sold in 1879 to another Civil War veteran, Doctor John Burton. Burton served with the Sixth Indiana Cavalry and as President of the United States Pension Board at the war's end before establishing a medical practice in Kirksville in 1867. The home took on its secondary moniker of \\"The Parrish Place\\" in 1895 when it was purchased by Doctor A. Washington Parrish. Doctor Parrish had a medical practice in Queen City, Missouri before purchasing the home and moving his practice to Kirksville. Following Parrish's death in 1928, the home passed to his son, Doctor Bert Parrish, also a physician and surgeon in the community. Bert Parrish died in 1951, leaving the home to his longtime housekeeper, Everrella Murdock. Murdock had lived on the first floor of the home since 1939. A fire in 1958 destroyed the summer kitchen, wood shed and coal storage room but was extinguished before causing any significant damage to the main house. Those areas lost were replaced by the addition of a new section to the home containing a family room. Another major change to the original design came in 1965 when, due to fears of a weakening roof, the distinctive cupola was removed. However the cupola was restored to its position several years later. The home after restoration. Upon Murdock's death the Harris-Parrish home went to her daughter Mary Childers Sloan, who resided there until moving to Nebraska in the 1980s. The home was mostly vacant from the early 1980s until Sloan's death in April, 2003. She deeded the home and property to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The present owner, Daryl Shafer, purchased the Harris-Parrish home from the Trust in 2007. After extensive renovations under the National Historic Trust's ownership and later Shafer's, the home once again appears very much as it would have when first constructed, save for modern electrical, heating and cooling systems, and plumbing. One of the most significant changes involved removing a two-tone exterior paint of cream with dark brown accents and returning the structure to its original red brick. The post-fire additions of a garage and the west wing containing the family room were removed and replaced with a porch and landscaping. In addition to serving as a private residence the home has also served as a popular spot for weddings, open houses, and community gatherings. One such gathering in 2012 honored the sesquicentennial of the Battle of Kirksville.

The Home was run by the Bon Secours Sisters, a religious order of Roman Catholic nuns, that also operated the Grove Hospital in the town. Unwed pregnant women were sent to the Home to give birth. In 2012, the Health Service Executive raised concerns that up to 1,000 children had been sent from the Home, for the purpose of illegal adoptions in the United States, without their mothers' consent. Separately in 2012, a local amateur historian, Catherine Corless, published an article documenting the history of the home before she uncovered the names of the children who died in the home the following year. In 2014, Anna Corrigan uncovered the inspection reports of the home, which noted that the most commonly recorded causes of death among the infants were congenital debilities, infectious diseases and malnutrition (including marasmus-related malnutrition). Corless' research led her to conclude that almost all had been buried in an unmarked and unregistered site at the Home, and the article claimed that there was a high death rate of residents. Corless estimated that nearly 800 children had died at the home. The Home is now being investigated by a statutory commission of investigation under Judge Yvonne Murphy ‚Äì the \\"Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation\\". Excavations carried out between November 2016 and February 2017 that had been ordered by the Commission found a significant quantity of human remains, aged from 35 foetal weeks to two to three years, interred in \\"a vault with twenty chambers\\". Carbon dating confirmed that the remains date from the timeframe relevant to the operation of the home by the Bon Secours order. The Commission stated that it was shocked by the discovery, and that it is continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way. Corless's original research noted that the site was also the location of a septic tank when overlaid with maps of the period of use as a workhouse. The 2017 report by an Expert Technical Group, commissioned by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, confirmed that the vault was a sewage tank after reviewing historical records and conducting a magnetometer survey; it concluded, \\"The combination of an institutional boarding home and commingled interments of juvenile remains in a sewage treatment system is a unique situation, with no directly comparable domestic or international cases.\\" In October 2018, the Irish government announced that it would introduce legislation to facilitate a full excavation of the mass grave and site, and for forensic DNA testing to be carried out on the remains, at a cost estimated to be between ‚Ç¨6 and ‚Ç¨13 million. History The old workhouse, on the Athenry Road, 1918. Between 1925 and 1961 in Tuam, a town in County Galway, the Bon Secours Sisters ran \\"The Home\\", an institution where thousands of unmarried pregnant women gave birth. Previously, it had been a workhouse and military barracks. =Workhouse and military barracks= The building that eventually became \\"The Home\\" was built in 1841 as a workhouse under the Irish Poor Laws. Like many other workhouses, it had been designed by Poor Law Commissioners' architect George Wilkinson to house about 800 people. This workhouse opened in 1846, close to the peak of the Great Famine. As well as dormitories, the main building contained an infirmary and an \\"idiot's ward\\". Sheds were constructed on the property to house additional inmates and fever victims. A fever hospital was later constructed next door. After the Famine, the workhouse continued to house the poor and homeless for more than sixty years. In 1916, during the uprising against British rule, British troops took over the workhouse, evicted the occupants and made the building their barracks. In 1923, during the Irish Civil War, six anti-treaty IRA volunteers were imprisoned and executed at the workhouse by Irish Free State forces, followed by two others some weeks later. These were among the last executions of the Civil War. The nuns who took over the building later erected a crucifix in memory of the executed IRA members. =Mother and Baby Home= The order of Bon Secours Sisters, led by Mother Hortense McNamara, took over the Tuam Workhouse in 1925 and converted it into \\"The Home\\". This resulted from the prior closure of all workhouses in the county by the Galway Board of Health, and the transfer of the hospital wing of Glenamaddy Workhouse to Tuam.Corless, page 5 Unwed single women who became pregnant were sent to give birth there, rather than at a hospital or at home. The nuns were trained nurses and midwives.Corless, p.6 In 1927, the Board of Health directed that a maternity ward be added to the Home so that the mothers could be segregated from the public wards. This was built in 1929. The mothers were required to stay inside the Home for one year, doing unpaid work for the nuns, as reimbursement for some of the services rendered. They were separated from their children, who remained separately in the Home, raised by nuns, until they could be adopted ‚Äì often without consent. Some women who had had two confinements were sent directly to nearby Magdalene laundries after giving birth, as punishment for their perceived \\"recidivism\\". According to Professor Maria Luddy, \\"Such a stance, though not intended to be penal, allowed for the development of an attitude that accepted detention as a means of protecting society from these reoffending women.\\" For each mother and child in the home, the County Council paid the nuns ¬£1 a week. (Average female earnings in 1949 were ¬£2.97/week; a loaf of bread cost three pence; a stone of potatoes (14 pounds) cost 14 pence)). At the end of the year, the mothers left while their babies were typically kept at the Home.Corless, p.7 The children stayed there until they could be adopted, fostered, or until they were old enough to be sent to industrial boarding schools.Corless, pp.7, 14 Even at the time, there were some complaints of fostered children being exploited. An October 1953 article in The Tuam Herald said \\"an effort was not always made to find the home that most suited the child or the child that most suited the home. The allowance given to foster parents was not always spent on the child's welfare\\".Corless, p.9 Local historian Catherine Corless also uncovered one case where a mother found work in England and paid the nuns to care for her son in the Home. The nuns did not tell her that her son had been fostered and kept each installment that she sent them.Corless, p.11 Some babies were sent to clergy in the United States to be illegally adopted by Catholic families there. A 1947 report by an official inspector who visited the Home says some of the children were suffering from malnutrition, and 12 out of 31 infants examined were described as being \\"emaciated and not thriving\\". It also says that the Home was overcrowded, with 271 children and 61 mothers living there. Death rates were extraordinarily high: 34 per cent of children died in the home in 1943; 25 per cent died in 1944; 23 per cent died in 1945; 27 per cent died in 1946. The report states \\"The death rate amongst infants is high... The death rate had appeared to be on the decrease but has now begun to rise again. It is time to enquire into the possible cause before the death rate mounts higher.\\" The report went on to say, \\"the care given to infants in the Home is good, the Sisters are careful and attentive; diets are excellent. It is not here that we must look for cause of the death rate\\". An inspection two years later in 1949, conducted by inspectors from the Galway County Council, reported \\"everything in the home in good order and congratulated the Bon Secour sisters on the excellent condition of their Institution\\". The Home closed in 1961, and most of the occupants were sent to similar institutions, such as Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea.Corless, pp.15-16 The building lay mostly disused until its demolition in 1972, and a new housing estate was built on the site. Mass grave =1975 find= In 1975, two 12-year-old boys were playing at the site of the former Mother and Baby Home. They found a hole or chamber \\"filled to the brim\\" with children's skeletons underneath a concrete slab. One of them later said he had seen about twenty skeletons. The slab was believed by some to have covered the former Home's septic tank. Locals speculated that these were the remains of victims of the Great Famine, unbaptised babies,. and/or stillborn babies from the Home. The number of bodies was then unknown, but was assumed to be small. It was re-sealed shortly afterwards, following prayers at the site by a priest. For the next 35 years the burial site was tended to by a local couple, who also built a small grotto there. =2012 article= In 2012, local historian Catherine Corless published an article about the home in the annual Journal of the Old Tuam Society. At that stage she did not have the names of all of the children who had died there. In 2013, Ann Glennon, a public servant at the Galway Health Service Executive registrar for births, deaths and marriages, at Corless' request and expense, retrieved the names of the 796 children who had death certificates listing \\"The Tuam Home\\" or the \\"Tuam Children's Home\\" as place of death. Most of children were infants and had died at the Home during its years of operation (1925 - 1961). In 2018, Glennon said she was \\"privileged\\" to be able to carry out the work. Corless studied the state death certificates and found that they listed a range of ailments such as tuberculosis, convulsions, measles, whooping cough, malnutrition and influenza. She then cross-referenced the names with those in local graveyards and found that only two had been buried in any of them. Her research led her to conclude that the only possible location for the bodies was the site where the skeletons were found in 1975. Maps showed that this was the site of the Home's septic tank. Corless believed that some of the skeletons found are inside the septic tank. This common burial ground was unmarked and not registered with the authorities; no records were kept of any burials there. International media outlets and other commentators described the site as a \\"mass grave\\". Corless's conclusions were supported by some local residents who recalled seeing nuns and workmen apparently burying remains there late in the evenings. In 2010, the bodies of 222 infants from Bethany Home, another maternity home, were found in a mass unmarked grave in Dublin. =2014 media coverage= In April 2014, Corless's research into Tuam was publicised during the dedication of a memorial to the 222 dead children at the Bethany Home. Corless is campaigning for a similar grave marker to be placed at the Tuam site. Numerous news reports alleging the existence of a mass grave containing 800 babies in a septic tank, based on Corless' work, were published - first by journalist Alison O'Reilly, in the Irish Mail on Sunday, and later by international media outlets in late May/early June 2014. The story sparked outrage in Ireland and internationally. The Irish government came under pressure to launch an investigation. The government called the allegations \\"deeply disturbing\\" and ordered the police to begin a preliminary investigation, with the aim of launching an inquiry. Reaction to the reports After the issue received global attention in 2014, some commentators, in advance of official factfinding investigations, criticised the story and proffered alternative explanations for the presence of bodies in a septic tank. Some of their suggested explanations were not supported or were actively disproved by the subsequent 2017 Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation interim report, following excavations of the site. Local Garda√≠ initially surmised that any bones on the site likely dated from the Great Famine in the 19th-century: \\"These are historical burials going back to famine times. There is no suggestion of any impropriety\\". Bones of famine victims had been found nearby in 2012, and archaeologists determined that they were 19th century \\"paupers\\" from the same Tuam Poor Law Union Workhouse which had originally occupied the building later used for the Bon Secours Children's Home. The Garda√≠ were later ordered to investigate and issue a report on their findings by the Minister for Justice. Data from the National Archives from 1947 showed that during the preceding twelve months, the death rate of children in Bon Secours was almost twice that of some other mother and baby homes. A government inter-departmental report into the records stated that an \\"assessment of mortality rates will need public health specialist/historical analysis of statistics on children born and resident at the home in Tuam\\". Professor Liam Delaney said the high child death rate at the Home could not be explained by higher overall child death rates at the time, nor by the higher death rate among \\"illegitimate\\" children. He added: \\"This points to something serious within these institutions\\". Kevin Higgins, a solicitor representing former residents, said that the number of deaths recorded at the Tuam home over a period of over more than 30 years was \\"off the scale\\" compared to the rate of children's deaths elsewhere at the same time. Additional coverage An RT√â documentary in the Would You Believe series, on the topic of the Tuam Babies, was broadcast on Sunday, 12 April 2015. In October 2017, The New York Times published an extended multimedia article, The Lost Children of Tuam, by Dan Barry and others covering the home, the children and the burial site. HSE child trafficking allegation On 3 June 2015, the Irish Examiner published a special report which claimed that the Health Services Executive (HSE) had voiced concerns in 2012 that up to a thousand children may have been trafficked from the home, and recommending that the then health minister be informed so that \\"a fully fledged, fully resourced forensic investigation and state inquiry\\" could be launched. The issue had arisen within the HSE when a principal social worker responsible for adoption discovered \\"a large archive of photographs, documentation and correspondence relating to children sent for adoption to the USA\\" and \\"documentation in relation to discharges and admissions to psychiatric institutions in the Western area\\". The HSE noted that letters from the Home to parents asked for money for the upkeep of their children and notes that the duration of stay for children may have been prolonged by the order for financial reasons. It also uncovered letters to parents asking for money for the upkeep of some children that had already been discharged or had died. The social worker had compiled a list of \\"up to 1,000 names\\". HSE reports mentioned the possibility that up to 1,000 children had been trafficked for adoption. One of those reports mentioned that it was possible that death certificates were falsified so children could be \\"brokered for adoption\\", which could \\"prove to be a scandal that dwarfs other, more recent issues with the Church and State\\". The report noted that deaths recorded at the Bessboro mother and baby home in Cork dropped \\"dramatically\\" in 1950 with the introduction of adoption legislation, stating \\"This...may point to babies being identified for adoption, principally to the USA, but have been recorded as infant deaths in Ireland and notified to the parents accordingly.\\" The Bon Secours Sisters in a statement said \\"As the Commission of Investigation has now been established the Sisters of Bon Secours do not believe it would be appropriate to comment further except to say that they will co-operate fully with that commission.\\" The October 2012 HSE memo recommended that due to the gravity of the issue, the then Health Minister be informed with a view towards launching a full inquiry. That did not happen, with the Minister only becoming involved following the revelations in the press of a mass grave at the home in May 2014. The report states that if thousands of babies were illegally adopted to the United States, without the willing consent of the birth mother, then this practice was facilitated by doctors, social workers, religious orders, and many more people in positions of authority. The report states that there is a real danger that some of these people may still work within the system. Writing in a 2012 HSE report, Dr Declan McKeown, a consultant public health physician and medical epidemiologist stated that the infant mortality rate in the home were \\"similar to those recorded at Bessborough\\" (another Mother and Baby Home), which were five times the rate for Ireland in 1950 and 65 times the 2012 rate. McKeown stated that these rates were equivalent to the infant mortality rate in Ireland in the 1700s. Commission of Investigation Following the revelations about the mass grave, there were calls locally and internationally for an investigation of the Tuam site and an inquiry into all such mother and baby homes. The Garda√≠ had initially released a statement saying \\"These are historical burials going back to famine times. There is no suggestion of any impropriety and there is no garda investigation. Also, there is no confirmation from any source that there are between 750 and 800 bodies present.\\" On 4 June 2014 the Irish government announced it was putting together representatives from various government departments to investigate the deaths at the home and propose how to address the issue. The then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Charles Flanagan said any government inquiry would not be confined to the home in Tuam and that officials would advise the Government on the best form of inquiry before the end of June 2014. On 6 June, two senior Garda√≠ were appointed to lead a \\"fact-finding\\" mission. They were asked to gather all surviving records and to carry out preliminary tests on the suspected mass grave. Garda√≠ said there was no criminal investigation as yet because there was no evidence of a crime, but senior sources said the review may change that. On 16 July 2014, the Irish Government appointed Judge Yvonne Murphy to chair the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby homes. In October 2014, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, James Reilly, announced that the draft terms of reference for the inquiry had been circulated to government departments for comment. In September 2014, a legal representative of former residents of the home has called on the Attorney General to order coroner's inquests to be carried out into the deaths. This would necessitate excavations and exhumations of the site, which is authorised under the 1962 Coroner's Act. On 19 February 2015, the then Minister for Children, James Reilly, announced that the terms of reference had been set out for the \\"establishment of the independent commission, which has a three-year deadline and which will cost approximately ‚Ç¨21 million, followed the signing by the Taoiseach of a Government order at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting\\". The three-person Commission comprises Judge Yvonne Murphy as Chairperson, with international legal expert on child protection and adoption Dr William Duncan, and historian Professor Mary E. Daly, appointed as Commissioners. On 25 May 2015, a remembrance ceremony for those who died at the Home was organised by a coalition of survivors' groups and was held outside Government Buildings. The organisers also sought: * \\"A separate and immediate acknowledgment, apology and redress to an aging survivor community\\" * \\"Full Inclusion. All single mothers and their children who were forcibly separated are to be included in the Commission of Inquiry as well as any home or institution related to these activities including all illegal activities.\\" * \\"Senator Averil Power's Adoption Bill to be passed within six months to open all lifelong sealed adoption files\\" =2017 find= On 3 March 2017, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation announced that human remains had been found during a test excavation carried out at the site between November 2016 and February 2017. Tests conducted on some of the remains indicated they had been aged between 35 foetal weeks and 2‚Äì3 years. The announcement confirmed that the deceased died during the period of time that the property was used by the Mother and Baby Home, not from an earlier period, as most of the bodies dated from the 1920s to the 1950s. The remains were found in an \\"underground structure divided into 20 chambers\\". While some speculated that this indicated that \\"children who died at the home were interred on the site in unmarked graves, a common practice at such Catholic-run facilities amid high child mortality rates in early 20th-century Ireland,\\" the Commission said \\"it had not yet determined what the purpose of this structure was but it appeared to be a sewage tank. The commission had also not yet determined if it was ever used for this purpose.\\" The Commission stated that it was continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way, that it had also asked the relevant State authorities to take responsibility for the appropriate treatment of the remains, and that it had notified the coroner. Minister for Children, Katherine Zappone said that the coroner's results would determine the direction of the investigation and that the commission would determine if other sites needed to be excavated, including another part of the Tuam site. The Adoption Rights Alliance and Justice for Magdalenes Research campaign groups demanded that Zappone publish a five-month-old report from the Commission on the issue of broadening the probe's terms of reference beyond the original 18 institutions included, and said the State must ensure that all human remains buried in unmarked graves at institutions in Ireland are identified. =Reactions=  Political reactions  Then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, described the findings as \\"truly appalling\\", saying \\"the babies of single mothers involved had been treated like some kind of sub-species.\\" He commended the work of Catherine Corless in bringing the issue to light. Speaking on the find in D√°il √âireann, in response to requests to widen the terms of reference of the Commission, he described the Mother and Baby Home as \\"a chamber of horrors\\". In the same debate, AAA- PBP T.D. Br√≠d Smith called for the Bon Secours order of nuns to be disbanded. She said \\"its hospital empire, the biggest private hospital group in the State, was built on the bones of the dead Tuam babies.\\" Smith said \\"everyone was not responsible for what happened in Tuam. It was paid for by the State, which knew exactly what was going on, and there were 'headage payments' of up to $3,000 for each child sent to the United States.\\" The Taoiseach's speech was criticised by some. In the D√°il, independent member Catherine Connolly directly addressed the speech, stating: Leader of Fianna F√°il, Miche√°l Martin T.D., called for a state apology for the infants, a commemoration to be held for them, and for the expansion of the Commission of Inquiry to include other institutions and sites. The then Minister for Justice, Frances Fitzgerald, stated that \\"the discovery is an infinitely sad reminder of an Ireland that was a very harsh, harsh place for women and their babies\\" and that \\"it shows the tortured relationship the State and church had with pregnant women - it is a tragedy that we are now facing in its entirety.\\" The President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, speaking about the find at an International Women's Day reception, said there \\"are dark shadows that hang over our meeting, shadows that require us all to summon up yet again a light that might dispel the darkness to which so many women and their children were condemned, and the questions left unanswered as we moved on.\\" President Higgins described Catherine Corless' work as \\"another necessary step in blowing open the locked doors of a hidden Ireland\\".  Reaction by the Catholic Church  The Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, Michael Neary, said that he is horrified by the confirmation that significant quantities of human remains were buried on the site of a former mother and baby home in the town. Describing the news as \\"a body blow\\", he said he had been \\"greatly shocked to learn of the scale of the practice during the time in which the Bon Secours ran the mother and baby home in Tuam\\". The Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference apologized for the hurt caused by its part in the system, which they said also involved adoptions. They also urged parishes to ensure that the burial sites of former residents are appropriately marked, and said that \\"the appalling story of life, death and adoptions related to the Mother and Baby Homes has shocked everyone in Ireland and beyond.\\"  Reactions of Catherine Corless and Irish media  Both TV3 and RT√â broadcast documentaries on the scandal, with the latter's Claire Byrne Live including a segment listing the names of all 796 children who had died at the home. Corless appeared on The Late Late Show on 10 March 2017, alongside Tuam survivor Peter Mulryan, whose sister is buried in the Tuam grave, Anna Corrigan, whose two brothers were born in Tuam, and journalist Alison O'Reilly, who broke the story. Corless received a standing ovation at the end of the segment. Host Ryan Tubridy said \\"If that audience represents the people watching tonight, there is a hunger in this country for the truth.\\" Corless was awarded the Bar Council of Ireland's Human Rights Award in October 2017, an award presented for \\"exceptional humanitarian service\\". In her acceptance speech, she said: Paul McGarry, SC, chairman of Bar Council, in presenting the award, said of Corless \\"She has worked tirelessly on their behalf and has shone a light on a dark period of our history, passionately represented the victims and their rights at all times, often in the face of adversity. She epitomises the very essence of a humanitarian and is a very deserving recipient of this award.\\" In October 2018, Corless was awarded an honorary doctorate by NUI Galway. Making the award, Professor Caroline McGregor of NUIG's School of Political Science and Sociology said Corless' research \\"sought to re-subjectify the children who had died and their families and relatives because in the moment of their death, they were treated more like objects to dispose of rather than subjects with right for dignity, justice and respect in life and in death. Her work is not just about a focus on those who died but also those who continue to live with the pain, trauma and hurt in the present.\\" She received an honorary degree from Trinity College, Dublin in December 2018. =Investigation team= In June 2017, Minister Zappone announced the appointment of an \\"Expert Technical Group\\" team of international experts, comprising an Irish-based forensic archaeologist, a US-based forensic anthropologist and a UK-based forensic scientist, to investigate the burial site. Zappone also said that she was considering broadening the terms of reference for the Commission, in order to \\"help to answer some of the questions which have been raised again in public debate\\". The team is led by Dr. Niamh McCullagh, who previously worked with the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains in Northern Ireland and the Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Command that aimed to locate the bodies of war dead. Zappone stated that McCullagh will identify options for government, looking at the possibility of exhuming the remains and identifying if there are any further remains on the site that have yet to be discovered. The team conducted an extensive geophysical survey on the site in July 2017. This consisted of data collection through a variety of non-invasive techniques, over the course of five days. The team liaised with the Coroner for North Galway, An Garda S√≠och√°na, the National Monuments Services and Forensic Science Ireland, and advice was received from the International Committee for the Red Cross. =Expert Technical Group report= In December 2017, the Expert Technical Group reported to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, outlining five possible courses of action on the Tuam site. The five possible courses of action outlined are: * Memorialisation: No further investigative work; Return the site to being managed as a memorial; Make site safe for public access. * Exhume known human remains: Recover human remains interred in the chambered structure identified to date and reinter elsewhere; No further forensic analysis of remains. * Forensic excavation and recovery of known human remains: Complete forensic archaeological excavation, recovery and analysis of human remains from the chambers identified to date. * Forensic excavation and recovery, and further evaluation/ excavation of other areas of potential burial/ interest: Complete forensic excavation and recovery of all human remains in memorial garden and any other targeted area, following geophysical survey, assessment of witness statements, historical records, etc. * Forensic excavation of total available area: Full forensic and archaeological excavation of all available ground formerly occupied by the M&B; Home. A total of , comprising memorial garden, playground, car park etc. Excludes private built areas (houses and gardens etc. subsequently built on the former site). Zappone said that before any decision was taken on the option to be used, she first wanted to consult with the local community in Tuam and other affected parties, such as relatives of those who were resident in the home. She said the consultation process, which would be undertaken by Galway County Council, would take three months. The Tuam Home Survivors Network said its members had given careful consideration to the Expert Technical Group's report and that the only appropriate action was \\"a complete excavation of the Tuam site to ensure the recovery of all human remains contained there\\". The Network are also seeking postmortems in respect of each set of human remains and cataloguing of DNA from all remains in order to create the most complete database possible. The Technical Group also identified a number of human rights issues which were outside its terms of reference. Zappone appointed human rights expert and Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Professor Geoffrey Shannon, to examine these issues and to report to her on his findings. Shannon's report was published on 23 October 2018, the same day as the announcement that the Tuam site would be fully excavated. Excavation decision On 23 October 2018, Minister Zappone announced that the Government had approved her recommendation for full forensic excavation of the available site. The approach taken will involve what is known as \\"Humanitarian Forensic Action\\" and will include: * a phased approach to the forensic excavation and recovery of the human remains; * the use of systematic on-site ground-truthing and test excavations to effectively locate potential burials; * the forensic analysis of any recovered remains and, where possible, individualisation and identification, and * arrangements for respectful reburial and memorialisation and the appropriate conservation of the site. Zappone said \\"I am committed to ensuring that all the children interred at this site can have a dignified and respectful burial\\", and that \\"this comprehensive and scientific approach provides us with the best opportunity to address the many deeply personal questions to which former residents and their families need answers.\\" Zappone said that due to the \\"unprecedented\\" nature of the site, bespoke legislation would be required in advance of the commencement of further excavations and forensic and DNA testing, and that drafting of such legislation is expected to commence in November 2018. Catherine Corless said that the full excavation and DNA testing announced was everything that they had been campaigning for. The Tuam Babies Family Group welcomed the announcement, saying \\"This is an exceptionally important decision and will pave the way for all the other mother and baby homes, and the lost children of Ireland. We hope this decision will bring peace to the families of these children.\\" The Bon Secours Sisters have offered a ‚Ç¨2.5 million voluntary contribution towards the costs of excavation and forensic excavation, which are estimated at between ‚Ç¨6 and ‚Ç¨13 million. Zappone stated that this contribution was not a settlement or an indemnity. In December 2018, the Taoiseach announced that legislation would be required to enable the full excavation to proceed. The required legislation is expected to be passed in the first half of 2019, with procurement of specialist services and planning going ahead at the same time, with the excavations then proceeding in the latter half of 2019. Taoiseach Varadkar said \\"We've never really done this before in Ireland, on this scale, so we've a lot to set up, a lot to learn before we do it. We're not entirely sure what we're getting into, but as a Government we're convinced this is the right thing to do, to remove the remains and to give those children a proper decent burial they didn't get.\\" Publication of My Name Is Bridget, April 2018 A book by Alison O'Reilly, My Name Is Bridget, was published in April 2018. Christina Noble spoke at the launch. The book covers the story of Bridget Dolan, whose two baby boys died while in the care of Bons Secours nuns. O'Reilly wrote the book after being approached by Anna Corrigan, Dolan's daughter, following her discovery that she had two brothers that she knew nothing about. John Desmond Dolan was born, a healthy baby, to his mother Bridget on Tuesday, 22 February 1946 in the Tuam Home. He died on Wednesday, 11 June 1947. He was described in an April 1947 inspection report as \\"a miserable, emaciated child with voracious appetite and no control over bodily functions, probably mentally defective\\". His death certificate, two months later, calls him \\"a congenital idiot\\". Corrigan then discovered she had a second brother in the Tuam home. John's younger brother, William Joseph, was born healthy on Sunday, 21 May 1950. William is registered as having died in the Tuam Home on Saturday, 3 February 1951 but no cause of death is given. The record of William's date of birth was altered (to Saturday, 20 April 1950), a common practice with babies trafficked abroad for adoption. Corrigan has reported her brother to the Garda√≠ as a missing person. The book contains additionally previously unpublished material, including a chapter, \\"Snapshots of stolen Lives\\", about survivors from other homes who have never told their stories before, and a report obtained under a Freedom of Information request by State Pathologist Professor Marie Cassidy, detailing her visit to the excavations then taking place on the Tuam site on 5 October 2016. The home's original septic tank, along with a more recent 'brickbuilt structure' consisting of two chambers, were discovered. Professor Cassidy wrote: \\"I was informed that bones, believed to be infant remains, had been found out with the original septic tank during the excavation.\\" She also described what she could see when she looked through a small hole into the chambers. The remains did not appear to have been carefully laid out, and had been deposited unceremoniously in the tank. \\"There was debris lining the floor of both chambers and recognisable infant bones scattered on top,\\" she wrote. \\"The bones were in a haphazard arrangement which no indication of having been encoffined or laid out. There were identifiable skulls and long bones.\\" The information in the report, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, showed just how accurate the verbal accounts given by children from Tuam who had stumbled upon the mass grave in the 1970s had been.' On 30 October 2018, journalist and author Alison O'Reilly, who first broke the story of the Tuam Babies in 2014, became the first Irish journalist to be awarded the Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage from Trinity Philosophical Society for her work in uncovering the story of the home, along with Anna Corrigan who also helped expose the story. Pope's visit to Ireland, August 2018 Katherine Zappone raised the issue of the mass grave with Pope Francis when she met him on his visit to √Åras an Uachtar√°in on Saturday 25 August, and presented him with a memorandum on the issue, telling him \\"I hope the church will make reparations for this shameful chapter. It is important and I will write to you in detail.\\" Speaking to members of the press, Pope Francis said \\"She told me, and she was brief: 'Holy Father, we found mass graves of children, buried children, we're investigating... and the Church has something to do with this.' But she said it very politely and truly with a lot of respect. I thanked her to the point that this had touched my heart.\\" A march from Tuam town hall to the Bon Secours site and a subsequent vigil were attended by over 1,000 people Sunday 26 August 2018, timed to coincide with a mass being celebrated by Pope Francis in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, during his visit to Ireland. The names of the dead were read out and a sculpture in memory of the dead was unveiled. Catherine Corless had been invited to attend a state reception for the pope by the office of the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, but she declined the invitation, saying \\"I had to take a stand with the babies. We have asked the Church to meet with survivors and to talk to us about the babies in the sewage tank. We have asked the Bon Secours sisters to give us some record, to come to Tuam, to help the survivors; to talk to them. For the last four years none of the priests or the Archbishop of Tuam indeed would entertain us.\\" In advance of the papal visit to Ireland, Corless wrote to the Vatican to ask that the pope meet one of the survivors of the home. She stated that her request had not been answered. In December 2018, the Sunday Independent published excerpts from a letter from Pope Francis replying to Katherine Zappone's letter, which it interpreted as putting pressure on religious orders to accept responsibility for the treatment of children who died in mother and baby homes. The Pope wrote \\"I pray in particular that efforts made by the Government and by local churches and religious congregations will help face, responsibly, this tragic chapter in Ireland's history.\\" No mention was made of additional reparations, as sought by the Minister. The Taoiseach described the response as \\"more of an acknowledgement than a substantive response.\\" Irish Council for Civil Liberties call, August 2018 On the 2018 International Day of the Disappeared (30 August), Liam Herrick, Director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, called for an investigation into the Bon Secours home and related issues such as the Magdalene Laundries and forced and illegal adoptions, saying Ireland had several questions to answer on enforced disappearances and what happened to unmarried mothers and their children throughout the 20th century. He said that: \\"When we look at Tuam, we're talking here about the obligations of the State to take all measures possible to identify the children who died in Tuam. And then to, where possible, return the remains to the families. We also are talking about a full public investigation into the circumstances of what happened at Tuam and steps being taken to guarantee that nothing of this nature could ever happen in another Irish institution in the future.\\" Grove Hospital Some Tuam residents have now called for an investigation into the town's Grove Hospital, which had also been run by the Bon Secours order. A number of people have claimed their children or siblings were buried on the site from the 1950s right up until the late 1970s, although the order denies that there was a graveyard on the site. Galway County Council has stipulated that an archaeologist must monitor excavation work on the site in order to preserve any remains which may be buried there.

The episode aired on May 27, 2014 in the United States on FX. It was written by series creator and showrunner Noah Hawley and directed by Scott Winant. The title refers to the paradox in logic known as the barber paradox. \\"Who Shaves the Barber?\\" deals with the consequences of the previous episode, \\"Buridan's Ass\\": while Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) is badly injured after Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks) accidentally shot her, the seeds planted by Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) to put the blame of his involvement in the murders on his brother Chazz (Joshua Close) are bearing fruit. The episode was very well received by critics, and was seen by 1.52 million viewers. Plot At the hospital, Grimly agonizes over accidentally shooting Molly and destroying her spleen, but the injury is not fatal. The unloaded gun Lester placed in Gordo's backpack is discovered at his school. The Nygaard home is searched by police and the incriminating evidence that Lester planted in Chazz's gun safe is found. Later, Lester tells Chief Oswalt a new story in which he claims Chazz killed Pearl during a heated lovers' quarrel. Lester also claims he was present when Chazz killed Chief Thurman, thus explaining his hand injury. He says he covered for his hot-headed brother because he feared retaliation. Lester is released from jail while Chazz is incarcerated. Molly talks to Mr. Wrench, who is hospitalized under guard, and informs him that his partner, Mr. Numbers, is dead. Wrench, who is deaf, declines to provide any information. Meanwhile, Lorne Malvo infiltrates the Fargo, North Dakota offices of the crime syndicate who sent Numbers and Wrench, and armed with the UMP-45 automatic rifle that was used in his murder attempt, Malvo massacres the gang and its boss. Lester seduces the money- hungry Mrs. Hess with promises of \\"greasing the palms\\" of the insurance agents responsible for her late husband's policy. Lester fails to mention that Hess had stopped paying the premiums and the policy was cancelled. Molly is discharged from the hospital and returns to Bemidji. She is dismayed to hear that Chazz Nygaard has been arrested and that Lester has been \\"cleared.\\" Reception =Ratings= The episode was first aired in the US on FX on May 27, 2014 and obtained 1.52 million viewers. The show was aired in the UK on Channel 4 on June 1, 2014 and was seen by 1.2 million viewers. =Critical reception= The critical response to the seventh episode of Fargo was very positive. It currently holds a \\"Fresh\\" 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, making it, however, the lowest-ranking episode of the season, tied with the previous episode \\"Buridan's Ass\\". The A.V. Club writers Zack Handlen and Emily VanDerWerff gave the episode a B+ rating, noting the drop in excitement from the previous episode, but praising Freeman and Odenkirk's performances. A more positive review came from IGN writer Roth Cornet, who gave the episode a 9.1/10 \\"amazing\\" rating and said \\"Overall, another great entry as FX's Fargo nears the climax of its 10-episode run. The series shines when it's truly standing on its own two feet and focusing on the characters that were created specifically for this world and this story. It stumbles a bit when it falls back on aping the Coen's classic film. However, those moments are relatively rare and there is far more to recommend in this nasty and comical study of human nature than not.

As the Paramount Chief of Osu, he is President of the Osu Traditional Council. He was elected President of the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs in 2016.  Professional life  Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI was born at Adabraka, Accra, into the Dowuona royal family of Osu in 1963. After his formal education at Swedru Secondary School in the Central Region of Ghana, he was recruited as a Banker and Computer Analyst by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale - Social Security Bank (SG-SSB), later becoming a senior software programmer at the bank. He is also a commercial farmer, with extensive cocoa plantation holdings in the Enchi District of the Western Region of Ghana.  Enstoolment as Osu Mantse  Prior to his ascension to the Osu Stool (or throne), Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI had served the Osu state in different capacities. He had been a member of the Kinkawe Asafo (warriors of Osu's Kinka Quarter), Secretary to the Dzaase (kingmakers) and also Secretary of the Osu Traditional Council. As a male member of the royal Dowuona House, one of the two Osu royal houses (the other being the Owuo House), Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI was in line to be enstooled king during the protracted chieftaincy dispute that had wracked the Osu state for decades. His service to the traditional authority had brought him to the attention of the stool fathers and therefore stood him in good stead to leverage his lineage. In the interim, however, another claimant, Nii Nortey Owuo III (also known as David Nortey Ashong), had held himself out to be King of Osu for several years, tracing his lineage through the Owuo House, though he was unable to secure the support of key stakeholders regarding his eligibility. On 4 May 2007, the accredited Dzaase in collaboration with the Wulomo (chief priest) and the leadership of the two royal houses, successfully installed Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI as substantive Mantse or King at the Osu Klottey Shrine located in the confines of the Osu Castle. This state of affairs resulted in high drama that year when both Nii Nortey Owuo III and Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI led rival processions to celebrate the Ga Homowo festival in August, though Nii Nortey Owuo had custody of the Osu Palace and received government functionaries and other traditional rulers in his capacity as Osu Mantse. The recognition given by government officials to Nii Nortey Owuo III during the festival and other functions provoked angry reactions from the Osu Traditional Council, which insisted that it recognised Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI and not Nii Nortey Owuo III as Osu Mantse Both sides litigated the matter in the courts, and a decision by the High Court in Accra in March 2010 settled the dispute in favour of Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI. Following this development, on May 2, 2010, the National House of Chiefs formally gazetted or entered the name of Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI into the National Register of Chiefs as recognised Osu Mantse . The National House of Chiefs also expunged from its records the name of Nii Nortey Owuo III as Osu Mantse, revoking and withdrawing the document previously issued to him recognising him as Osu Mantse, noting that as far back 1992, the Government of Ghana had passed Executive Instrument (EI) 31 (Osu Stool Property (Seizure and Restoration) Instrument), which ordered the City Manager of Accra to take possession of the Osu Stool Property until a legitimate chief was enstooled. The House of Chiefs regarded EI 31 as effectively destooling Nii Nortey Owuo III. The Nii Nortey Owuo III faction continued to contest the enstoolment of Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI, and when the latter was officially installed as Paramount Chief of Osu in May 2010, police had to fire rubber bullets to prevent the disruption of the event. However, Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI has subsequently exercised full substantive powers as Osu Mantse , and is recognised by the Government of Ghana, politicians and traditional rulers in Ghana and abroad, as well as the public, as such. His position as Paramount Chief of Osu makes him the traditional landlord of the Government of Ghana and he is rec ognised as an authority on custom and tradition.  Elevation to Paramountcy  Following a five-year enquiry, the Ghana National House of Chiefs on 27 April 2012 elevated the Osu Stool to Paramountcy status, five years into the reign of the new King. This brought Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI greater prominence in the hierarchy of traditional authorities in Ghana, and gave the Osu Traditional Area a greater say in its affairs. Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI was therefore inducted into the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs as Paramount Chief of Osu. The inclusion of the name ‚ÄúKinka‚Äù in his stool name is a significant linkage to Kinka We (Kinka Quarter), where the two royal houses of Osu (Dowuona and Owuo)as well as the Dadebu Shrine are based. In historical times, the Dadebu (literally, \\"steel pit\\") was the vault dug in the ground for storing and concealing weapons used by the Asafo (warriors). In December 2016, Kinka Dowuona VI was elected President of the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs for a four-year term., making him the lead spokesperson for traditional rulers in the region.  Development agenda  Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI announced a bold development agenda on his enstoolment. Osu lands encompass prime real estate in national capital of Accra, and the King has sought co- investments to leverage state assets in favour of his people. He has launched the Osu Mantse Community Development Initiative (OMANCODI), a community based initiative aimed at supporting the national government in the socio-economic improvement of the Osu state. The areas of focus for this program are Health, Education, Agriculture, and Real Estate Development. In 2012, he was awarded a Certificate OF Excellence for his dedication to the development of his traditional area by the Elders Forum of the Distinguished Scholars of Africa.. He is an advocate for a stronger, non-partisan role for traditional rulers in national governance.  Private life  Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI was born to Osu natives Mr. George Nii Noi Dowuona-Owoo and Mrs. Grace Koshie Odarley Wellington. He is married and has six children: Grace Naa Shormeh Dowuona- Owoo, George Nii Noi Dowuona-Owoo, Richard Nii Narku Dowuona-Owoo, Naa Shormeh Dowuona-Owoo, Michelle Naa Shormeh Dowuona-Owoo and Naa Korlei Dowuona-Owoo.

It is especially focused on the Community of Christ (formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or RLDS Church), other midwestern Restoration traditions, and early Mormonism. The Community of Christ's approach to its own history was influenced, in part, by historical problems raised and explored through JWHA publications and conferences, and those of its sister organization, the Mormon History Association. JWHA membership numbers around 400 and is open to all, fostering cooperation with LDS and non-Mormon scholars.  History  = Background = Before the founding of the JWHA, scholarship in the field of Mormon history had been developing. In the 1950s, scholars like Fawn Brodie, Juanita Brooks, Thomas O'Dea, and Leonard Arrington began applying academic methods to their religious history, giving rise to the New Mormon History. In this spirit, Robert Flanders, a professor at the RLDS- affiliated Graceland College, published Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi in 1965. The book presented controversies, like Joseph Smith's polygamy, that were in contrast to faith-promoting teachings of the RLDS Church, and brought a backlash from some RLDS members. Then Richard P. Howard, another proponent of the New Mormon History, was appointed Church Historian in 1966, further upsetting some traditional believers. Howard opened the church archives and was optimistic about historical challenges. This progressive approach to Mormon studies inspired Courage: A Journal of History, Thought and Action, founded in 1970 by several faculty from Graceland College. Contrasting with conservative RLDS publishing, Courage ventured a fresh look at RLDS issues and historical problems, often diverging from traditional interpretations. The independent journal closed in 1973, by which time several of its team had started the JWHA. Throughout this time, Mormon historical scholarship was developing within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Utah. In 1965 the Mormon History Association was founded, which included RLDS historians amongst its officers. The periodicals BYU Studies (started 1959) and Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought (started 1966) published articles from MHA members. MHA founder Leonard Arrington was appointed LDS Church Historian in 1972, forming a new Church Historical Department which was active in the historical community. = Founding = Richard P. Howard was RLDS Church Historian when the JWHA was founded at a gathering in his home, and served as JWHA president in 1985. Despite positive experiences, RLDS historians in the midwest found MHA participation difficult due to the distance to Utah. So on September 18, 1972, fifteen like-minded RLDS historians met together in Independence, Missouri, in the living room of Richard P. Howard, the official historian of the RLDS Church, and organized the John Whitmer Historical Association. Some had organizational expertise from their service as MHA officers. Most of these were already members of the MHA, and the JWHA was founded with the intent to continue the collaboration and warm relations with the MHA. Richard Howard won an MHA award in 1970 and was interested in exchanging ideas between LDS and RLDS scholars. From its beginning the JWHA board of directors included LDS members, and Utah historians were invited to join. The first JWHA meeting was held in September 1973 in Nauvoo, Illinois. = Impact on the church = Founded as an independent group, not under the direction of any church, the JWHA would be free to explore historical controversies. Participants supported the New Mormon History, cultivating a lively tradition of exploring controversy in Mormonism. Some traditionalists and religious leaders warned that this approach could damage faith, while questioning and liberal Latter Day Saints found community and intellectual freedom. As John Whitmer, the first Church Historian in 1831, was remembered for his controversial history of early Mormonism and falling out with church leaders, the name evoked taking the side of the historian when in conflict with the institution. Through the JWHA, RLDS members confronted Joseph Smith's historical link with Mormon polygamy, a defining issue for the RLDS Church. Church leaders worried that publications in the 1960s and 1970s, including Flanders's book, might trouble church members after more than a century of official RLDS insistence that Smith was never involved. On direction from President Wallace B. Smith, Howard undertook a five-year study which was then edited and softened by RLDS leaders and historians in 1982. The First Presidency recommended it be presented at the JWHA, and later in the John Whitmer Historical Association Journal. But after some blowback the First Presidency denied involvement, saying the JWHA Journal did not speak for the church. Jan Shipps commented that \\"faith seemed endangered and help and comfort were needed\\". This became one of the \\"Church- shaking changes\\" that transformed the RLDS Church in the 1980s and 1990s, alongside the ordination of women, the new temple in Independence, and the break with father-son succession of the presidency. The church moved from its Mormon heritage toward liberal Protestantism, adopting the name Community of Christ in 2001. W. Grant McMurray, church president from 1996-2004, demonstrates the influence of the JWHA on the Community of Christ. Working for the church as a researcher and later as the archivist, McMurray advanced into church leadership. During this time McMurray joined other RLDS supporters of the New Mormon History to found the JWHA, serving as its president in 1981. He continued to present and publish influential articles, while also serving in high church offices. As church president, he presented a paper to the JWHA in 1999, as a response to an earlier critique of the RLDS Church, where he stated that his past historical research had influenced the positions he took as church president. In 2006, after resigning the presidency, McMurray was able to speak frankly about Joseph Smith's polygamy at the JWHA, which had so troubled the church in the 1970s and 1980s.  Academic community  Jan Shipps, a non-Mormon, delivered the first paper to a JWHA conference and served as JWHA president in 2004-05. The JWHA is considered an important professional venue within the Latter Day Saint historical community. Historians from different backgrounds connect and share research, and develop scholarship. JWHA is often a venue for research which is later published in book form by a scholarly press. For example, Jan Shipps, a non-Mormon scholar, opened the first JWHA conference in 1973 with a paper entitled \\"The Prophet Puzzle,\\" which was then picked up the next year by the Mormon History Association as the head article in the inaugural issue of the Journal of Mormon History. Years later the paper was again highlighted in the Essays on Mormonism Series published by Signature Books. In another example from the 1973 JWHA conference, Lawrence Foster, another non-Mormon, shared his research on polygamy with LDS Assistant Church Historian Davis Bitton. Bitton invited Foster to the LDS archives in Salt Lake City, Utah, leading to Foster's first published book. Since its founding, the JWHA has worked closely with its \\"sister organization\\", the Utah-based Mormon History Association. The two organizations have held a joint conference and have long offered joint memberships. Many MHA members are also JWHA members, or also members of the Utah State Historical Society, all three of which Jan Shipps called \\"Mormon to the core\\". Several presidents of the MHA have also been presidents of the JWHA, as well as one BYU religion professor. In addition to the MHA, the JWHA has also co-sponsored conferences with the Sunstone Educational Foundation and collaborated with the Mormon Missouri Frontier Foundation, including an archaeological dig at Haun's Mill in 2002. The JWHA and MHA fostered an interfaith dialogue that helped thaw relations between the LDS and RLDS. Each organization published research and reviewed books by members of both faiths. This complimented the trust developed in the 1960s between Richard Howard, the RLDS Church Historian, and Robert Matthews, an LDS researcher of Joseph Smith's Bible translation manuscript, held in the RLDS collections. From this goodwill, the RLDS Church approved Matthews' research for publication in the official LDS Edition of the Bible in 1979. While it is most often compared to the MHA, the role of the JWHA has also been compared to other organizations within the historical community. This includes the Sunstone Education Foundation, the Dialogue Foundation, Signature Books, the Utah State Historical Society (and other Utah history groups), the LDS Church History Department, and Brigham Young University institutions like the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute, the Charles Redd Center, the Religious Studies Center, and the BYU history department. Also compared are societies beyond Mormon studies, such as the American Historical Association, the American Academy of Religion, the Western History Association, and the Communal Studies Association.  JWHA Journal  The JWHA began publishing the John Whitmer Historical Association Journal (JWHA Journal) in 1981. It followed several Mormon studies journals founded in the 1960s and 1970s, including Courage and Restoration Studies by RLDS scholars. The Journal of Mormon History already provided a venue for historians, but there was room for another history journal in the wake of the New Mormon History and a proliferation of scholarly writing in the 1970s. For many years the JWHA Journal was published annually in October (but is now semiannual) with scholarly papers, book reviews, and other features. It often contains papers from the JWHA conferences, and sometimes articles are later reprinted in Restoration Studies for a more general audience. Subscriptions are included with all JWHA memberships. While maintaining a special focus on Community of Christ history, the Journal publishes on all areas of Mormon history, drawing interest from LDS historians. Although founded by Community of Christ scholars, a significant proportion of the articles and reviews are written by LDS or non-Mormon contributors. The JWHA Journal is peer-reviewed with a reputation for strong scholarship and as a major publication in its field. It is compared to Mormon studies journals, like Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, the Journal of Mormon History, Sunstone, BYU Studies, the Utah Historical Quarterly, Exponent II and the RLDS journals Courage: A Journal of History, Thought and Action and Restoration Studies. Also compared are non- Mormon journals, like the Journal of the Early Republic, the Illinois Historical Journal, and Church History.  Conferences  Richard Bushman speaks to the JWHA meeting in Springfield, Illinois in 2011. The JWHA holds its annual meeting at a different historic site within Mormon history, on the last full weekend in September. Professional and independent historians from the Community of Christ, and elsewhere, present their research to an attendance of around 100. Scholars are introduced to each other and to new research. As many attendees are believers at different levels of faith, Jan Shipps observed that JWHA and MHA conferences can sometimes serve as quasi- religious support groups when faith is challenged by history, with non-LDS providing a neutral space.  Activities  Aside from the annual meeting and Journal, the JWHA is involved in several other activities. Scholarships are offered to students working on Mormon history, allowing them to attend and present to the conference. Awards are also presented by the JWHA for best books and articles in Mormon history. These are found alongside other awards in Mormon studies, such as those from the MHA and the Utah State Historical Society, the Dialogue Foundation, and the Evans Biography Award. The JWHA hosts a scholarly lecture at its Spring Banquet, held in Independence, Missouri, before each triennial World Conference of the Community of Christ, during a time when church members and leaders are gathered to the city. In 2005, the JWHA founded John Whitmer Books, a publishing imprint for scholarly titles in Mormon Studies. The JWHA also publishes a newsletter irregularly (intended to be quarterly), which started in 1979, and has been joint publisher of Restoration Studies since 2009.

He was born on 18 May 1907, in University Place, Nebraska and earned his doctorate at the California Institute of Technology in 1932. In 1934, he joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he retired in 1972. Evans died at the age of 88 of respiratory failure on December 31, 1995 in Paradise Valley, Arizona where he lived in retirement. Evans was survived by his wife and onetime colleague, the former Mary Margaret Shanahan of Paradise Valley, and three children. For all his efforts and research he is considered one of the founders of Nuclear Medicine. Education 1928 California Institute of Technology, BS degree in physics * 1929 Masters in Science * 1932 PhD * 1934 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Assistant Professor * 1945 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Professor of Physics Contributions to Nuclear Medicine While Robley Evans was a graduate student at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the Los Angeles County Health Officer, Frank Crandall, was investigating the hazards that radium-containing patent medicines posed to the public health. These products were being manufactured in the Los Angeles area and any possible health effects were Crandall‚Äôs concern. Crandall contacted Evans‚Äô supervisor, Robert Millikan, and this proved to be a pivotal moment in the young Evans‚Äô life because he spent most of his career researching the physiological effects of radiological substances.http://www.aboutnuclear.org/view.cgi?fC=History,Hall_of_Fame After graduation Robley Evans worked at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was able to continue his research into radium poisoning. The scintillation cameras currently found in hospitals are the results from the first whole body counter to measure radium uptake using the radium dial painters. This first generation counter was used to conduct the first measurement of a radionuclide in the human body. He did not just use his expertise for measuring radium in the body. He sought to determine what effects radium had on the human body. These studies included the body‚Äôs metabolism, the hazards, and how to minimize any harmful side effects. In 1941 this research enabled Professor Evans to establish one ten-millionth of a gram (0.01 ŒºCi) of radium as the \\"maximum permissible body burden\\" - the greatest quantity of a radioactive substance that the human body can tolerate without a likelihood of damage, allowing a large margin for safety. Perhaps the greatest contribution Robley Evans made to the medical field was the use of radioiodine to assess human thyroid conditions without invasive surgery. This method was used from the 1930s to the 1980s and was counted as one of the medical community‚Äôs greatest tools for monitoring the health of patients. Evans's accomplishments in medical physics included development of a technique to preserve human whole blood, research primarily undertaken for the benefit of wounded servicemen in World War II. By using as many as two radioactive forms of iron and one of iodine - a so-called \\"triple tracer\\" experiment - doctors could determine how well transfused blood cells remained in a recipient's blood stream. A chemical was found to preserve the blood for up to three weeks, the time it required to reach distant battlefields and subsequently was used in blood banks for several decades.

It was the first luxury boutique to be founded on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California. History Giorgio Beverly Hills was founded by Fred Hayman and George Grant. The name was derived from Grant's first name. Giorgio Beverly Hills opened in 1961 at 273 Rodeo Drive at the junction with Dayton Way, which was then a very ordinary street. Gucci, Tiffany and others established Rodeo Drive stores in the mid-1970s. Hayman recognised the potential of the site, as it was close to The Beverly Hilton hotel, where he had been working. The store used a signature yellow-and-white striped awning, which came to symbolise a Beverly Hills lifestyle. Hayman bought out Grant in 1962. The store had a reading room, pool table and oak bar, so that men could amuse themselves while the women shopped. In 1979, it was determined that there should be a signature fragrance; two years later in November 1981, Giorgio was launched. In that year, the Rodeo Drive store had an annual turnover of $6 million. Fred Hayman and his wife Gale spent $260,000 on a huge launch party for the perfume, hosted by Merv Griffin, and with food from five of Los Angeles' top restaurants. The \\"GBH\\" fragrance business would soon turn over $100 million a year. In 1987, the fragrance business and the Giorgio Beverly Hills brand was sold to Avon for $165 million. The store's name was changed to Fred Hayman Beverly Hills. In 1994 the Giorgio brand was acquired by Procter and Gamble for $150 million that combined it with other luxury fragrance brands such as Hugo Boss, Laura Biagiotti and Otto Kern into what is now the P&G; Prestige Beaut√© division. =Clientele= Customers included Natalie Wood, Princess Grace, Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan, Diana Ross, Charlton Heston, and Elizabeth Taylor.

The material is still in the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor.Tian L, Anderson I, Riedemann T, Russell A, Kim H. Electr Pow Syst Res 2013;105:105. It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high- strength conductor is needed. Its physical properties make it especially well- suited for DC transmission. Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the core strands and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type. This conductor is inherently strong so that there is no need for a strong (usually poorly conductive) core to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors. This eliminates the \\"bird caging\\", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the core and outer strands. The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys. The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines.Padiyar,K.R. (2011) HVDC Power Transmission Systems, second ed., New Academic Science, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, UK. Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs. The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind/ice loading situations. The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses. Al-Ca composite conductor was invented by Russell and Anderson at Ames Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy with the goal of developing the next generation power transmission cables.Russell A.M., Anderson, I.E., Kim, H.J., and Frerichs, A.E. (2014) \\"Aluminum/Alkaline Earth Metal Composites And Method For Producing Same\\" Al/Ca composite is produced by powder metallurgy and severe deformation processing (extrusion, swaging, wire drawing). This process would be roughly two to three times more expensive than conventional melt processing for ACSR. But the cost saving on tower construction is projected to be substantially larger than the extra cost of the conducting cables. During deformation processing, the Ca powder particles deform into filaments surrounded by the Al matrix, which avoids exposing calcium, a reactive element, to air and moisture. The corrosion resistance of this composite has been found to be similar to that of pure aluminium. Al-Ca composite has good microstructural stability even above 300 ¬∞C. The formation of intermetallic compounds at the interface would stabilize the microstructure to avoid the degradation of its various properties during exposure to elevated temperatures, such as those encountered during emergency overload situations. Newest development An Al/Ca (20 vol%) nanofilamentary metal-metal composite was produced by powder metallurgy and severe plastic deformation. Fine Ca metal powders (~200 ¬µm) were produced by centrifugal atomization, mixed with pure Al powder, and deformed by warm extrusion, swaging, and wire drawing to a true strain of 12.9. The Ca powder particles became fine Ca nanofilaments that reinforce the composite substantially by interface strengthening. The conductivity of the composite is slightly lower than the rule-of-mixtures prediction due to minor quantities of impurity inclusions. The elevated temperature performance of this composite was also evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and resistivity measurements. The ultimate tensile strength is as high as 480 MPa, twice as that of ACSR. The electrical conductivity 33.02 (ŒºŒ© m)‚àí1 is higher than most current commonly used conductors.

This contrasts with, for example, age segregation; separating children into age-defined activities and institutions (e.g., some models of organized schooling). Integrating children in the range of mature family and community activities gives equal value and responsibility to children as contributors and collaborators, and can be a way to help them learn. Children's integration provides a learning environment because children are able to observe and pitch in as they feel they can. In the United States, child integration into \\"adult\\" life is not as common as it used to be. However, in other cultures social norms continue to incorporate children into the mature, productive activities of the family and community. In all cultures child integration is present in one way or another. For example, nearly all children's first language learning seems to be supported through integration with a mature linguistic community. Children usually are not taught in a classroom how to speak, but instead learn by observing the language and pitching it when they can.  Examples of children in collaborative communities  Children in Indigenous communities participate in mature activities with the guidance from someone who has practice in that activity. When engaged in shared endeavors the guider and the learner both notice and assess how much understanding the learner has in the task and the guider provides support if it is needed. Indigenous cultures emphasize and instill values of being respectful, empathic and cooperative to their children. These values are practiced through tasks like co-sleeping and group play which helps bring about close connections within the family and community. There are many different ways children can be integrated into society. One example, child care educators in certain Native communities, like the First Nations in Canada have taught children traditional language, where then the children have the responsibility to spread that language knowledge by teaching their parents and other family members, thus ingratiating them into society with responsibility to carry on the language legacy. The Chippewa people have several different methods of teaching, such as lecturing and counseling, and integrating children into adult and community life. Overall, the children do the same tasks as their mothers and fathers just on a smaller scale. For example, a young girl might learn to make nets like her mother and uses the same knots her mother uses but makes smaller nets than her mother. Throughout the years she will slowly make bigger and bigger nets and perfect the skill that her mother and her mother's mother before her had. These skills may be learned by observation and sometimes if a specific person in the community is very skillful at something, the adults might recommend the child go find that person and learn from them. = Community endeavors = The integration of children into community and family endeavors in Indigenous American Communities begins as early as infancy. Among the Mayan peoples of the Yucatan peninsula, children are allowed to roam freely allowing them ample opportunity to become acquainted with the mundane activities of the family. In the Mexican indigenous community of the Mazahua, children will coordinate their activities with those of their parents in a manner that allows them to cooperate in familial endeavors and may at times be granted a leading position in the endeavor. Children are considered to be valuable and responsible contributors of the community. The process of child integration into mature activities begins in infancy and continuous throughout time; between ages 3 and 4 the child will already be participating in some of the family's day to day activities, by ages 5 and 7 that child will already be cooperating in most of the endeavors that adults engage in and will have also earned several important responsibilities which can range from performing certain household tasks to providing childcare for younger siblings. The cultural practice of integrating children in the mature activities of the family and community is common in many Indigenous American communities. Many integrate children into \\"adult\\" activities, work life, and other cultural practices at a very young age. Among the Quechua people of the Andes, families accept the child as a part of an integral process towards a collective wellbeing.Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press p. 43 Two-year-olds in the Chillihuani community frequently get their own food and drink, and those of herding families participate in herding and caring for the animals.Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press p. 43, 48 In this community, work and play are not two separable things (i.e., one for adult and one for children). The children enjoy having real responsibilities and find pride in being able to contribute to their society. Similarly, some Chippewa communities of Washington also commonly integrate children in the mature activities of the community. Children are expected to observe and work with their parent to be able to develop skills for that line of work. Young girls assist their mothers with beadwork, household chores, chopping wood, etc., and boys are expected to work on canoe- making with the men and are given arrows to learn hunting skills at 5 or 6 years old.Hilger, M. I. (1951). Chippewa child life and its cultural background. Washington: U.S. G.P.O.)p. 56 Daily household activities provide the child the ability to learn cultural practices such as different food dishes, hygiene, and parenting skills, as well as the social values and religious beliefs.Zelizer, Viviana. 2005. Pricing the Priceless Child: The Changing Social Value of Children. New Jersey: Princeton University Press.Gaskins, Suzanne & Ruth Paradise. 2010. Learning through Observation in Daily Life. In: David Lancy, John Bock & Suzanne Gaskins (eds.), The Anthropology of Learning in Childhood. Lanham: Altamira Press, pp109. It is common for children in Indigenous American communities to learn through trial and error instead of explicit instruction. This is due to the cultural understanding of \\"echando a perder se enesena la gente\\" (throwing to lose, teaches people) which promotes optimism and growth of the child in the community, allowing the youth to feel comfortable making mistakes as long as they keep working towards their goal. Children in the town of Tepoztlan are encouraged to participate in community activities. The people there believe that everyone can contribute something to community endeavors. Young children are encouraged to participate by being brought to various meetings and activities by their mothers, so as they grow older, they request to be admitted into the group on their own will. = Political movements and civic life = Some Indigenous American communities can incorporate young children into the political activities of the community. Political violence and displacement within the community of San Agustin Loxicha, Oaxaca created an important aspect of child participation in the community's struggle. In this community, it is common for young children to take part in marches or sit-ins, hunger strikes, school life, child play, and accept the political part of their lives instead of seeing it as a hardship or something to be pitied. In the Nahua indigenous town of Tepoztlan located near Mexico City, children, adolescents, and older members of the community were involved in a 5-year long political movement against the construction of a golf course in their town. During assemblies children participated by aiding in the preparation of food and drinks for the crowd, while adolescents brought in groups of peers to further political involvement in the community. During marches and protest children and adolescents were active members of the civic movement. Any repression that the group suffered on behalf of the authorities was not seen as something negative in the experience of the youth, but was instead something that would further motivate their desire to be politically active. Through their integration into the political structure of the civil movement, the child's/adolescent's understanding of the issue expanded to such a degree that they would not only have physical presence in the group but would also be capable of offering new perspectives and potential solutions to the issue at hand. It is important to note that none of the children and adolescents involved were forced to do so. If a child showed an interest in the political movement they were encouraged by the adults to become participants but ultimately the choice was always left to them. Once a child decided to become involved the parents and other adults respected the pace and rhythm of that involvement. = Language brokering = In some immigrant communities, children link their family and friends to the environment around them by translating and paraphrasing words, phrases or occurring situations.Orellana, Marjorie, F. & Reynolds, Jennifer & Meza Marie (January/February/March 2003) \\"In other words: Translating or para-phrasing as a family literacy practice in immigrant households\\", Reading Research Quarterly 38, 12-34. This practice is known as language brokering and is used by children in immigrant communities to integrate themselves into family endeavors and into civil society.Bauer, Elaine (2010) \\"Language brokering: Practicing active citizenship\\", mediazioni 10, http://mediazioni.sitlec.unibo.it , ISSN 1974-4382 The child's contribution by language brokering integrates them into many environments, such as the doctor's office, at parent-teachers' conferences, banks, housing offices, and various sorts of negotiation activities. Subsequently, children who engage in language brokering are more likely to also be representatives of their community when transitioning into adulthood.Bauer, Elaine (2010) \\"Language brokering: Practicing active citizenship\\", mediazioni 10, http://mediazioni.sitlec.unibo.it , ISSN 1974-4382 Child integration has become very important to form linkages between new immigrant communities and the predominant culture and new forms of bureaucratic systems. With the increased interaction in larger societies children in Indigenous Mayan communities who are bilingual help monolingual parents as interpreters. For example, the children will translate for parents when selling products in the barrios of Cancun, where the primary language is Spanish. = Productive endeavors = In some indigenous communities, children are often integrated as active participants into family and community work. Child work is often a vital contribution towards community productivity and typically involves non- exploitative motivations for children's engagement in work activities. In some families, young children contribute to the family's finances by taking a job in a factory or a store under the supervision of a formal adult figure, while some join the family business under the oversight of their parents and older siblings. When children join the family business they tend to gain knowledge of a trade such as accounting, public relations and how to be able to time manage. Some children not only obtain an economic boost for the family as a whole, but also learn autonomy and altruism with regards to having their own earned income to support the family and also to spend for themselves.Salazar, M. (1991). Young workers in Latin America: protection or self-determination?. Child Welfare, 70269-283.  Children's motivation as integrated contributors  Children in Indigenous American communities pitch in to community endeavors because they experience their contribution having a tangible effect on their community. The children often contribute without being told and children get to learn how to do the activity as they contribute. However, children aren't just born with this way of learning by observation; they have been given the opportunity by being encouraged to attend, observing, and participating in mature activities. In indigenous communities, children's and adult's interests in participation must be viewed as equal, not just the adults forcing their views onto the children. Children are seen as a part of community just as much as adults. In many cultures, children are expected to take on tasks that are important to community. Children are also seen as integral members of the community, rather than separate from adults. Some cultures even give children control over specific goods, such as livestock or arable land and the expectations that come with this may also be seen as forms of participation. These ideas of children actively participating in their communities and influencing the society opens up opportunities for the participation of children  History of age segregation in the West  Segregating children by age was not always the norm in the United States. A century and a half ago, children in the US had access to a wide range of adult activities and were integrated into multiple aspects of family functioning and survival. The change from this integration into segregation was a product of industrialization, Western formal schooling, child labor laws, social services agencies, and the rise of disciplines such as Psychology and Education. A combination of the above caused a shift from family working as a unit to separation of economic activities and services such as childcare emerged.

The bridge carries Arbataash Tamuz (14th of July) street from the center of the city (formerly the Green Zone) south into the Karrada peninsula. The bridge is named after July 14, 1958, the day in which the Hashemite monarchy was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat. It is the only suspension bridge in Baghdad. The bridge has two lanes in each direction, but in practice only one lane is used because of the strict security checks. The suspension bridge has a span of 167.64m (550ft), of which the lateral openings are 83.82m (275ft) wide. Since the ground of Baghdad consists of alluvium, the anchor of the ropes does not provide enough support in order to withstand the tensile forces, so the bridge is a so-called self-anchored (spurious) suspension bridge. David B. Steinman was awarded the contract for designing the bridge in 1956, however the bridge was unable to start construction until 1961, due to the political circumstances in Iraq and the fact that Steinman died in 1960. The bridge is painted in the shade of green which Steinman preferred. In the Gulf War the bridge was attacked on 9 February 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, which killed three and injured six, causing large-scale damage to the bridge. The bridge was re-opened on 25 October 2003 after the fall of Saddam Hussein. However, following a bombing in Baghdad on 13 November 2003, it was closed until the middle of 2004 for safety reasons.

Hayman recognised the potential of the site, as it was close to The Beverly Hilton hotel, where he had been working. The store used a signature yellow-and-white striped awning, which came to symbolise a Beverly Hills lifestyle. Hayman bought out Grant in 1962. The store had a reading room, pool table and oak bar, so that men could amuse themselves while the women shopped. Customers included Natalie Wood, Princess Grace, Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan, Diana Ross, Charlton Heston, and Elizabeth Taylor.

After gaining an interest in local history from attending an evening course, Corless decided to write an article about the mother and baby home inspired by her own childhood memories of the institution. She spent her spare time searching records in libraries, churches and council offices, after which she uncovered that 796 children died in the home and she identified that there were death certificates but there were no burial records. She has received a number of awards in recognition of her work, including a People of the Year Award in 2018. Investigation into the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home =Initial Research= After writing a piece for the local history journal on landlords, the editors of the journal were impressed by her work and asked if she would consider submitting another article. Her own memories of the children's home, and attending school with children from the home, sparked her interest in the topic. Corless has related on a number of occasions how she feels guilty about a trick she once played on one of the children from the home, copying a classmate by wrapping up a stone in a sweet wrapper and offering it to a girl who grabbed it, thinking it was a treat. Corless found that very little had been written concerning the mother and baby home, and that extensive research would be required for her article. She started by asking locals on the estate that has been built on the site of the home and was shown the site of a mass grave believed by locals to be famine victims. Corless next turned to Ordnance Survey maps of the area, which indicated the site of the grave to be a septic tank in 1890. She asked for information from the Bon Secours, but was not provided with anything of use. Corless next obtained death certificates for some of the children in the home and realized there was no indication of where the children had been buried. She wrote up her article for the local journal, covering all aspects of the home, and asked the question at the end of her article: had the dead children been buried in the septic tanks? The article did not gain the attention Corless expected from the authorities and so she did further research into the number of children who had died in the home. Between 2011 and 2013, by paying 4 euro for each record, she obtained 798 death records for children who died in the home, but no burial records. =Media Coverage= Corless initially approached the local media in 2013 concerning the results of her investigations, with the aim of raising funds for a larger memorial on the site, but only a small article was printed. This was followed in February 2014 with a further piece in the Connacht Tribune, again concentrating on the call for a plaque to be installed at the site with the names of those children who had died. She continued her research, talking to several people who had been born in the home or thought relatives may be buried there. The story broke nationally in 2014, with front-page coverage from the Irish Mail on Sunday. Corless then found herself receiving many requests from the international media. Corless was reportedly upset by some of the speculative nature of the reports, such as the assumption all of the children who died at the home were buried in the septic tank. In 2017, a Commission of Investigation concluded that remains in an underground structure on the site, which appeared to have been a septic tank, did contain remains of infants that died during the time period the mother and baby home was operating. Corless made several more media appearances following this announcement. She appeared on The Late Late Show in March 2017 to talk about her research. She received a standing ovation from the audience at the conclusion of her interview. She was also featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme Profile and then in 2018 on PM in a segment called The Home Babies. Corless appeared in the RT√â documentary No Country for Women in 2018, presenting the story of Julia Carter Devaney who spent the first 45 years of her life in the Tuam mother and baby home. In July 2018, she gave a lecture at the Galway International Arts Festival. =Criticism of Corless= Corless has received criticism for her research. She has stated that many locals expressed that the matter should have been left alone. She also claimed that she had been told to drop her research and regarding the bodies that she should \\"just leave them there\\". Local woman Mary Moriarty also reported hearing locals stating that the matter should be left alone. After the story appeared in the national media, Corless has stated she was contacted by the Bon Secours headquarters in Cork and told that she had upset the older Religious sisters and that her information was untrue. After the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation concluded that the bodies in the mass grave at the site of the home did date from the time the home was open, and were not famine victims, it was widely reported that Corless has been vindicated by the conclusions. Her husband commented that he had not realised there was so much doubt surrounding the conclusions of Catherine Corless' research. =Support for Exhumation= Corless has several times made statements supporting the exhumation of the mass grave in Tuam. In 2017, speaking after receiving a Human Rights Award for her work, she said \\"The ideal would be to exhume those little bodies and just show them some dignity and reverence and to perhaps reinter them in the main Tuam graveyard which is only across the road.\\" She was critical of the consultation process on the future of the site put in place by Galway County Council, and called on the public to show a preference for the option of a full forensic examination, stating this would \\"bring the long-awaited justice to the families of the babies buried in this tank\\". She raised the issue again in April 2018, after receipt of her Person of the Year Award. Critical of the fact money was a factor in the potential future options for the site, Corless said, \\"There are some suggestions to memorialise the site, but I think that is disrespectful and not acceptable. A full exhumation is now needed. We need to remove the remains of these innocent children ‚Äì it is no place for them ‚Äì and give them a respectful burial. It would be part of the healing process for all of the families involved. The only thing stopping a full exhumation is money, and that is not good enough.\\" Corless turned down an invitation to a reception for Pope Francis's visit to Ireland, and attended a vigil that was held at the same time at the Papal Mass, stating that she was \\"taking a stand with the babies\\".  Awards  Corless has received a number of awards in recognition of her investigation into the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home. In 2017 she received the Bar of Ireland Human Rights Award in recognition of \\"exceptional humanitarian service\\". In her acceptance speech, she said: In the same year she received a Special Award for Investigative Research at Newsbrands Ireland Journalism Awards 2017. She was made one of Galway's People of the Year in February 2018. In April 2018 Corless was one of The Rehab Group People of the Year Award recipients. She received a standing ovation at the ceremony and was widely praised on Twitter. The President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, praised the work of Catherine Corless whilst speaking at the Galway International Arts Festival. Of Corless, Higgens said,\\"She has demonstrated not only courage and perseverance but a remarkable commitment to uncovering the truth, to historical truth and to moral truth. All of us in this republic owe a debt of gratitude to Catherine for what was an extraordinary act of civic virtue\\". In October 2018, Corless was awarded an honorary doctorate by NUI Galway. Making the award, Professor Caroline McGregor of NUIG's School of Political Science and Sociology said Corless' research \\"sought to re-subjectify the children who had died and their families and relatives because in the moment of their death, they were treated more like objects to dispose of rather than subjects with right for dignity, justice and respect in life and in death. Her work is not just about a focus on those who died but also those who continue to live with the pain, trauma and hurt in the present.\\" Corless received an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin in December 2018. On the same day, the Trinity Long Room Hub hosted an event, \\"In Conversation with Catherine Corless.\\" Corless was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Literature by University College Dublin on 4 September 2019, \\"For the values of humanity Catherine exemplifies and for the difference she has made to the world.\\" In October 2019 Catherine was awarded an honorary doctorate by NUI Galway for her advocacy and truth seeking on behalf of the survivors and their families from the Tuam Mother and Baby Home. Personal life Corless was born in Tuam and lived in the area her whole life. She married her husband, Aidan Corless, in 1978. She was a secretary in a textile factory before she gave up work to be a full-time mother to her four children. She studied local history in an evening course. She discovered her own mother was illegitimate, with no father listed on her birth certificate, and had been raised by foster families.

It is known from a single species, the type species, H. tianshanensis. Discovery and naming In 2006 from the Hami region in Xinjiang, a Konservat-Lagerst√§tte was reported, in this case lake sediments allowing for an exceptional preservation of fossils. The same year, Qiu Zhanxiang and Wang Banyue started official excavations. Part of the finds consisted of dense concentrations of pterosaur bones, associated with soft tissues and eggs. The site represented a nesting colony that storm floods had covered with mud. Dozens of individuals could be secured from a total that in 2014 was estimated to run into the many hundreds. In 2014, the type species Hamipterus tianshanensis was named and described by Wang Xiaolin, Alexander Kellner, Jiang Shunxing, Wang Qiang, Ma Yingxia, Yahefujiang Paidoula, Cheng Xin, Taissa Rodrigues, Meng Xi, Zhang Jialiang, Li Ning, and Zhou Zhonghe. The generic name combines that of the Hami region with a Latinised Greek œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ, pteron, \\"wing\\". The specific name refers to the provenance from the Tian Shan, a mountain range. The holotype, IVPP V18931.1, has been found in a layer of the Tugulu Group dating from the Lower Cretaceous. It consists of a skull, probably of a female. The paratype is IVPP V18935.1, the skull of a male individual. The inventory number IVPP V18931 does not pertain to a single skeleton, but to a block containing various bones of different individuals. Eleven such blocks had in 2014 been secured, numbered IVPP V18931 to V18941. Together, they comprise the remains of at least 40 animals, both bones and soft tissue remnants such as the horn sheaths of skull crests. Exceptionally for pterosaur fossils, the bones have not been crushed, but were preserved three-dimensionally in good condition. Five uncrushed eggs were also found. The finds in 2014 represented the largest known concentration of pterosaur fossils, with the exception of the Pterodaustro nesting colonies of Argentina. Description The wingspan of the individuals described in 2014 ranged from . The describing authors indicated some distinguishing traits, all of them autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The dentary, the front bone of the lower jaw, has a hook-shaped process. The ascending branch of the jugal bone, running to the lacrimal bone, is thin, inclined to the front, and expanded at the top. The central supraoccipital of the top rear skull bears a well- developed crest. The humerus is perforated by a pneumatic foramen near the base of the deltopectoral crest. The outer lower carpal bone of the wrist has a spike-shaped process pointing to below. Also present is a unique combination of traits that in themselves are not unique. The front snout bone, the premaxilla, bears a crest with ridges and grooves that curve to the front. The groove on the dentary reaches the highest point of that bone. Both the snout tip and the tip of the lower jaws are slightly expanded. The deltopectoral crest is moderately twisted around the longitudinal axis of the humerus. Phylogeny Snout of Iberodactylus compared with that of Hamipterus Hamipterus was within the Pterodactyloidea, placed into the group Pteranodontoidea. An exact cladistic analysis could not resolve the relationship with Istiodactylus, Ludodactylus and the Anhangueridae. The cladogram below is a topology recovered by P√™gas et al. (2019). In the analyses, they recovered this genus within the family Hamipteridae.Rodrigo V. P√™gas, Borja Holgado & Maria Eduarda C. Leal (2019) On Targaryendraco wiedenrothi gen. nov. (Pterodactyloidea, Pteranodontoidea, Lanceodontia) and recognition of a new cosmopolitan lineage of Cretaceous toothed pterodactyloids, Historical Biology, Paleobiology The large number of individuals found allowed the establishment of a growth series, showing how individuals developed through their ontogeny. Larger animals feature a number of changes. Their snout tips become relatively wider. The snout crest becomes more robust and expands its base towards the front, beginning at the level of the fifth tooth instead of the sixth. The pattern of grooves and ridges on the crest grows more prominent. The snout tip also starts to straighten in side view, no longer curving upwards. The groove in the dentary deepens and lengthens, as well. No change, however, takes place in the number of teeth, the degree of fusion in the symphysis of the lower jaws, or the shape of the postcranial skeleton, as far as can be ascertained, given the fact that the elements behind the skull were not found articulated. It was assumed that a clear sexual dimorphism was discovered, with the largest specimens sporting the largest crests being the males, while smaller individuals were females with smaller crests. This was seen as a refutation of the hypothesis that with pterosaurs, only the males possessed crests. Tomography scans of fossilized Hamipterus eggs suggests that young Hamipterus had well-developed thigh bones for walking, but weak chests for flight. With the close proximity of the nests and adults, as well as how underdeveloped the hatchlings were for flying, it has also been suggested that Hamipterus practiced some form of parental care. However, this study has since been criticized by some paleontologists.

The series was originally developed, produced, and occasionally directed by William Asher for Ashmont Productions and Screen Gems and premiered on September 12, 1972, in the time slot of Tuesday nights at 8:00 PM. The regular cast consisted of Cleavon Little as Dr. Jerry Noland, Joan Van Ark as Nurse Annie Carlisle, Reva Rose as Nurse Mildred \\"Millie\\" MacInerny, Nancy Fox as Student Nurse Ellen Turner, and James Whitmore as Dr. Vincent Campanelli. The premise of the series featured Campanelli as the no-nonsense chief-of-staff of Capitol General, a (fictional) Washington, D.C. hospital, who is forced to deal with the outlandish antics of Noland and the three nurses, whom Campanelli refers to as \\"the four horsemen of aggravation\\". During its first season‚Äîand first format‚Äî26 episodes were aired with the final one broadcast on . Reruns of the season's episodes continued until September 4, 1973. Despite heavy competition in the ratings from Maude on CBS and Bonanza on NBC, Temperatures Rising did well enough in its first season to be renewed for a second. For this second season, John Mitchell, the head of Screen Gems, decided to replace James Whitmore with comedian Paul Lynde, whose own sitcom, The Paul Lynde Show (also produced by William Asher for the 1972‚Äì73 season) was to be cancelled. Asher was against the change and declined to continue with Temperatures Rising, resulting in him being replaced as producer by Duke Vincent and Bruce Johnson. Under them, Van Ark, Rose, and Fox were dropped from the cast along with Whitmore, thus retaining Little as the only returning member. The New Temperatures Rising Show, as the series was now retitled, began airing on , and starred Paul Lynde as Dr. Paul Mercy, Sudie Bond as his mother Martha Mercy, Barbara Cason as Miss Tillis, the head nurse, Jennifer Darling as Nurse \\"Windy\\" Winchester, Jeff Morrow as Dr. Lloyd Axton, John Dehner as Dr. Charles Cleveland Claver, and Cleavon Little as Dr. Jerry Noland, while Jerry Houser was featured in a recurring role as an intern named Haskell. In this season Mercy was presented as the penny-pinching chief-of-staff, with his nagging mother as the owner of the hospital. Little's character was changed to the chief surgeon and \\"the only sane member of this medical madhouse\\". The New Temperatures Rising Show ran for 13 episodes before being placed on hiatus on . The ratings for the show were poor and, as a result, Mitchell asked Asher to return to the series as producer and restore it to its original format‚Äîalbeit with Paul Lynde continuing in the lead. For the third format of the series‚Äîwhich reverted to the original title of Temperatures Rising‚ÄîBond, Cason, Darling, Morrow, Dehner, and Houser were dropped from the cast while Lynde and Little continued as, respectively, Dr. Mercy and Dr. Nolan. Added to the line-up were Alice Ghostley as Nurse Edwina Moffitt, sister of Dr. Mercy, and Barbara Rucker as Nurse Kelly, while Nancy Fox, from the first-season cast, returned as Nurse Ellen Turner. Offered as a summer replacement on Thursday nights, the third format of the sitcom ran for seven episodes from July 18 to , after which it was canceled permanently.

The seven-story building was designed by Neff and Thompson with a Y-shaped floor plan and was completed in 1927. Most of its hotel rooms featured views of the Atlantic Ocean, and all had private bathrooms. The hotel also featured dining facilities and opportunities for shopping, as well as amenities such as swimming pools that are now common features of modern hotels. Entertainment, sports figures, and other celebrities who stayed at the Cavalier included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald, Bob Hope, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Doris Day, Bette Davis, Muhammad Ali, President Harry Truman, and President Jimmy Carter. Other U.S. Presidents staying overnight at the Cavalier included Herbert Hoover, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson. On Memorial Day weekend in 1929, shortly before the stock market crash, the famed Cavalier Beach Club opened on the oceanfront at the bottom of the Cavalier Hotel and drew big dance bands such as Benny Goodman, Cab Calloway, Glenn Miller, and Lawrence Welk, and other performers, including Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. The hotel was built during the period of prosperity known as the Roaring Twenties, and was a major element of the development of Virginia Beach as a resort area. The hotel was operated successfully until 1942, when it was commandeered by the United States Navy as a training center during World War II. It was returned to its owners in 1945, but the lost years hurt the business. The property was used as a private club for a time in the 1950s and 1960s, and eventually reopened as a hotel. The hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The hotel property was sold in 2013 under court order and the new owners began an extensive renovation and restoration of the structure with an anticipated opening of summer 2016. Due to unanticipated repairs, the owners announced in April 2016 that the opening would be delayed until 2017. The additional demolition and work added $24 million to the original $50 million estimate. Work completed in late 2017 and the facility opened in spring 2018 with 62 rooms and 23 suites, down from the original 135. The hotel also retained 21 of its original . On what had been vacant land north of the hotel, the owners constructed a housing development. In 2015, they demolished the Cavalier Oceanfront Hotel, across Atlantic Avenue, and began constructing a new hotel, scheduled to open in 2020. They also have plans for a third hotel in the complex. The Cavalier Hotel officially opened Wednesday, March 7, 2018, with a \\"Grand Reveal\\" event at the historic property.

Before a name change in 1981 its name was Korean Evangelical Layman's Church. In South Korea it is commonly known as Guwonpa, meaning Salvation Sect, from the Korean term guwon () meaning \\"salvation\\". Media reports on numbers of followers vary from 10,000 to as much as 200,000 members worldwide with many sources saying the church is believed to have 20,000 followers. The church has alluded to have 100,000 followers. Church doctrines teach that those who were once saved by God are completely detached from the sins they will ever commit in the future and guaranteed a path to heaven. Unlike other Christian organizations, the group is alleged to focus little on repentance ‚Äï a reason why it has been described as a cult. The church was held to be a cult by the conservative Christian denomination, the General Assembly of Presbyterian Churches, in 1992. Evangelical Baptist Church is unrelated to the Korea Baptist Convention.  Odaeyang mass suicide  In 1987 South Korean police were investigating accusations against a 48-year-old woman, Park Soon-ja, saying that she had swindled billion ( million) from about 220 people. Her company Odaeyang Trading Co. was a firm that fronted for a religious sect led by Park, which was a splinter group from Yoo Byung-eun's Evangelical Baptist Church. On 29 August, thirty-two members of the sect who believed in doomsday, including Park Soon-ja and her three children, were found dead, bound and gagged. The case became known as the Odaeyang mass suicide. Police assumed the event was a murder‚Äìsuicide pact, and the prosecution initially suspected that Yoo Byung-eun was linked to the case; but he was never charged, and the police closed the case as a mass suicide. When the case was re-opened in 1991, investigation into Odaeyang Trading Co. revealed a money trail to the company Semo Corp. run by Yoo, he was arrested and, in 1992, convicted of \\"habitual fraud under the mask of religion\\" for his role in colluding with one of his employees to collect donations from church members in the amount of billion ( million) and invest them in his businesses. He served a 4-year prison term. In November 2014, the Incheon District Prosecutor's Office stated in a report that they did not find a prosecutable connection between Yoo's Evangelical Baptist Church and the Odaeyang incident.  Sinking of Sewol  The ferry Sewol capsized and sank on 16 April 2014, resulting in 304 people dead or missing, the second worst ferry disaster in South Korean history. Sewol was operated by the company Chonghaejin Marine, for which Yoo Byung-eun was former chairman. Based on evidence collected during investigation into the sinking of Sewol, prosecutors concluded that Yoo was the one who directed operation and execution of business in Chonghaejin Marine. Yoo is the head of the family who partially own Chonghaejin Marine, and is believed to exercise influence through a web of company cross- shareholdings. Yoo Byung-eun is known to mainly reside in a rural church compound called \\"Geumsuwon\\" () located east of Anseong in the Gyeonggi Province some south of Seoul. Yoo has a photography workshop there, and according to his publicist Michael Ham, managing director of Ahae Press and co-director of Evangelical Media Group, Beginning in 2009, Yoo began obsessively focusing on his photography work, spending every day completely dedicated to his photography for more than four years‚Äîallegedly taking about 2.7 million photographs during this time, all through one window. Members of the sect run the compound Geumsuwon as a commune where they grow organic produce and run a freshwater fish farm. On 23 April, investigators of the Incheon District Prosecutors' Office raided the head office of Chonghaejin Marine, and some 20 offices of its affiliates, as well as the office of the Evangelical Baptist Church in Yongsan, central Seoul. Prosecutors suspected that funds from members of the religious group had been used in business operations of Chonghaejin Marine and Yoo Byung-eun. The prosecution found more than 100 bogus companies, many of them set up and operated by followers of a Yoo's religious group, had paid Yoo and his two sons at least billion (~ million) for their \\"consulting services,\\" and had purchased photos taken by Yoo. On 24 April, a financier of the Evangelical Baptist Church was summoned for questioning to trace deals between the sect and companies run by Yoo and his two sons. Transcripts of land registers showed that four days later on 28 and 29 April, Yoo and his family signed over some 24 properties worth around billion (~ million) to the Evangelical Baptist Church. On 28 April 600 followers of the Evangelical Baptist Church staged a protest rally in front of the headquarters of the Korea Broadcasting System in Yeouido, Seoul against media coverage of, and the investigation into the group's links to the operator of the ferry Sewol, denying suspicions that the Evangelical Baptist Church had cross-border transactions with affiliates of the ferry operator. Prosecutors warned on 24 May, that anyone who helps Yoo in hiding faces up to three years in prison. Four members of Yoo's religious group were arrested 25 May for assisting Yoo to escape detection by the police. On 26 May, Yoo's religious group, in an apparent move to confuse investigators, said that Yoo might have returned early in the morning to Geumsuwon. A spokesperson for the sect later announced that Yoo had not returned, further saying, \\"We hope Yoo doesn't get arrested. A 100,000 followers will protect Yoo. Even if the entire congregation of 100,000 believers is arrested, we won't hand him over.\\" Lee Jae-ok, another member of Yoo's religious group, chairman of Yoo's foundation Hemato-Centric Life Foundation, and one of Yoo's close aides, was arrested on 26 May on charges of planning Yoo's life as a fugitive and helping him evade detection for weeks.

The player's job is to guess the correct ranking order by grabbing four tablets representing the four clips one at a time, taking each in a spinning obstacle course called the Spinning Wheel of Doom consisting of several hurdles and a wall, and placing them in what s/he thinks is the proper order. When s/he is done, the winner comes out, presses the button on the podium and Carlos tell them how many he/she got right (similar to the \\"Race Game\\" on The Price is Right). After the first check out, the wall opens and will stay open for the rest of the round. On the second check out, Carlos tells the player that one of the videos in the correct position is locked in provided that any are right and the player would not need to change it . If the player can place them in that right order in 90 seconds or less, they win the grand prize and get to ride the \\"Slime Wave\\" when they get all four right confetti would get shot out .

Biography Fitzherbert was the second but first surviving son of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert and Maud (n√©e Cotton). He married Anne, daughter and heir of Sir Anthony Eyre of Padley, and through her the Fitzherberts were able to add the manors of Padley and Hathersage in the Derbyshire Peak to their holdings. On his father's death in 1538, Sir Thomas succeeded to the estates, and still in his twenties became Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1543 and a member of the last Henrician parliament, 1545‚Äì7. Under Philip and Mary he was knighted, and was sheriff again in 1554, but his and his family's fortunes changed with the accession of Elizabeth I. Having refused the Oath of Supremacy, Sir Thomas was arrested in 1561, and imprisoned in the Fleet Prison, London. He spent the rest of his life in one form of imprisonment or another, and died in the Tower of London on 2 October 1591.Cox, J. Charles. ‚ÄúNorbury Manor House and the Troubles of the Fitzherberts.‚Äù Derbyshire Archaeological Journal 7 (1885): 221-5, an excellent account of the Fitzherberts. Having no children of his own, Sir Thomas's heir was his nephew, also called Thomas, the eldest son of his brother John. This man became a henchman of Richard Topcliffe, Elizabeth I's friend and enforcer of her penal laws against the practice of Catholicism. Thomas bound himself to pay Topcliffe ¬£3,000 for the prosecution to death of his uncle, his father, and a cousin, William Bassett of Blore, Staffordshire. His father and uncle both died in prison, but Topcliffe failed to establish a case against Bassett, and so Thomas junior refused to pay up, especially since, as he said, his father and uncle died of natural causes. Topcliffe then sued for the money in the court of Chancery. The case was put over to a secret hearing where it was decided, with the queen's backing, in Topcliffe's favor. By then Fitzherbert was in such financial difficulty himself that Topcliffe never saw the money.Dom Bede Camm, O.S.B. Forgotten Shrines. Second edition. London: MacDonald & Evans, n.d. [1936]. This is another excellent account of the Fitzherberts and their encounter with Topcliffe. The Fitzherberts were an important and influential family in Staffordshire and Derbyshire, and Topcliffe was determined to destroy them. At one point he had Sir Thomas, his brothers John and Richard, and his nephew Anthony all in prison. The three brothers died there, but with the advice and help of Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, Anthony was released on a promise to conform to the Protestant Church of England. He immediately set about saving his family's patrimony, which his brother was selling off as fast as he could. He recovered the chief manor of Norbury, but his brother had made over Padley, the house where he and his father had been arrested, to Topcliffe. In 1604, with Elizabeth I dead and James I now king, Earl Gilbert, now a privy councilor, \\"heaved\\" Topcliffe out of Padley,\\"heaved\\" is Topcliffe's own word, in a letter to the earl (Talbot Mss, Vol. M, f. 184 [Lambeth Mss., 3203]) and that estate too went back to Anthony Fitzherbert, who quietly resumed his Catholicism. When the family's senior branch failed with the death of Anthony's son Sir John in 1649, the junior branch, descended from Sir Thomas's brother William of Swynnerton, Staffordshire, inherited their properties, which they combined with their own. The Fitzherberts are still at Swynnerton, where they now hold the title Baron Stafford, and they are still Catholic. Topcliffe, on the other hand, had bankrupted himself paying for his policing activities out of his own pocket. His unfortunate heir, Charles Topcliffe, had no option but to sell his estate, Somerby, just outside Gainsborough, and the Topcliffes seem to have disappeared as a family of some consequence.Dennis C.

Early years Jos√© Pablo Arias Martinez was born in the former Mercado de Abasto district of Buenos Aires on 16 January 1900. He first appeared on stage in 1916, and became a remarkable stage actor in grotesque, comedy and drama roles. In 1922 the influence of the company of Madame Rasimi and her Ba-Ta-Cl√°n, arrived from Paris, established the structure of the Buenos Aires revue. Arias learned his art among the founders of Argentine theater, such as Luis Arata and Enrique Da Rosas. He perfected all the elements of farce and grotesque, with his face painted with extreme make-up. He also played serious roles, and earned the Municipal Award for best dramatic actor for his performance in Ovid by Laurent Doillet at the Odeon Theatre in 1942. Film and radio Puerto nuevo (1936) Arias' style became established when he moved to film and radio. He was a pioneer of talking films, and appeared in twenty four films. These included the brilliant Kil√≥metro 111 (1938) directed by Mario Soffici and Fantasmas en Buenos Aires (1943) directed by Enrique Santos Disc√©polo. He became known on radio for delivering monologues as characters such as \\"Don Vistobueno Ciruela\\". He also starred in long-running revues at the Maipo and the Nacional theaters, and would deliver his monologues on stage. He avoided television, which he called \\"a dreadful fire that burns with lightning speed\\". Monologues In 1963 Arias described the monologue as a type of political reporting. He said that he read the headlines and told the news on stage, adding a humorous comment but always with up-to-date information. Thursday's political joke is not funny on Friday. He would call his audience his \\"dear filipipones\\". The nonsense word perhaps came from \\"philippic\\", and was used by his \\"Brother Jos√©\\" character in El hermano Jos√© (1941). The mocking but affectionate greeting became the trademark of his monologues. It is the title of his 1989 biography by Carlos Inzillo. In 1956 Arias said that political jokes were a basic element of revues in Buenos Aires, and he had never had real problems. He called politics a gentleman's game (juego de caballeros), which the public always understood, as did the governments of Yrigoyen, Alvear, Uriburu, Justo, Ortiz and Castillo. Those political leaders knew how to laugh. They knew that humor turned politics into a game and stripped it of solemnity and seriousness, which are always dangerous. Politics is a gentleman's game and those who are not gentlemen cannot play politics. There was only one period when satire disappeared from revues, but otherwise nothing happened. He was banned between 1952 and 1955 by the Peronist government. Last years In the late 1950s Pepe Arias discovered and fell in love with the resort town of Pinamar. He began to spend much of his time there with his partner Petra, in peace and quiet at their home on Burriquetas Street. Pepe Arias died in his sleep at 5:00 p.m. on 23 February 1967 in Buenos Aires. His last film was La se√±ora del intendente (1967) by Armando B√≥, released after his death, where he looked tired beside Isabel Sarli.
