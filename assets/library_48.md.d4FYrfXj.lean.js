He was known for his home run hitting power, and was named the 1983 AL Rookie of the Year. Kittle played for the Chicago White Sox (1982‚Äì86, 1989, 1991), New York Yankees (1986‚Äì87), Cleveland Indians (1988) and Baltimore Orioles (1990). He batted and threw right-handed. Kittle was also a manager for the minor league Schaumburg Flyers. Career A former steelworker who made his MLB debut at nearly 25 years old, Kittle was a popular player on the 1983 \\"Winnin Ugly\\" Chicago White Sox when they won 99 games and made their first playoff appearance since the 1959 World Series. That season, Kittle was selected an All-Star and won Rookie of the Year honors after hitting 35 home runs (club record for a rookie) and 100 RBI. Kittle also hit 50 homers in the minor leagues with the Edmonton Trappers and has his jersey retired in Edmonton at Telus Field. He was voted winner of 1982's Pacific Coast League Most Valuable Player Award. Kittle maintained his home run power, but after 1983 his batting average declined and his strikeouts increased. Kittle left the White Sox after 1986 and played part of 1986 and all of 1987 with the New York Yankees. Kittle then played 1988 with the Indians. He briefly returned again to the White Sox in 1990, playing first base. Later in the season he was dealt to the Baltimore Orioles. He returned to the White Sox again and finished his career in Chicago in . Kittle appeared in 843 games over the course of his 10‚Äìyear MLB career. He recorded 176 home runs and 460 runs batted in.  Managerial career  In 1998, Kittle was hired as the first manager of the non-affiliated minor league Schaumburg Flyers of the Northern League. During the early years of the Flyers franchise, Kittle did a series of TV commercials to promote the team, using the gimmick \\"Ma Kittle,\\" where he played both himself and his \\"Ma Kittle.\\" The ads were successful at sparking some initial interest in the team as the Flyers hoped to steal away fans from the nearby Kane County Cougars, then a Florida Marlins Class A team. The ad mimicked the highly successful Converse ads where Larry Johnson starred as both himself and \\"Grandmama.\\" Kittle resigned his position in 2001. Personal life Kittle was married from 1984 until 2010 and has two children. Kittle's memoirs, Ron Kittle's Tales from the White Sox Dugout, was published in 2005. Co-written with Bob Logan, who also co-wrote Michael Jordan's book Come Fly with Me, the book features anecdotes from Kittle's time as a major leaguer, mostly with the White Sox. Kittle builds custom collectible benches out of baseballs, bats and bases. He also works in public relations for the White Sox and maintains a popular website and blog.

Example of use Researchers often want to measure, say, medical compounds in the bodies of animals. It's hard to measure them directly, so it can be chemically joined to a radionuclide - by measuring the radioactivity, you can get a good idea of how the original medical compound is being processed. Samples may be collected and counted at short time intervals (ex: 1 and 4 hours). But they might be tested for radioactivity all at once. Decay Correction is one way of working out what the radioactivity would have been at the time it was taken, rather than at the time it was tested. For example, the isotope copper-64, commonly used in medical research, has a half-life of 12.7 hours. If you inject a large group of animals at \\"time zero\\", but measure the radioactivity in their organs at two later times, the later groups must be \\"decay corrected\\" to adjust for the decay that has occurred between the two time points. Mathematics The formula for decay correcting is: A_t = {A_0}*{e^{-\\\\lambda t}} where A_0 is the original activity count at time zero, A_t is the activity at time \\"t\\", \\"Œª\\" is the decay constant, and \\"t\\" is the elapsed time. The decay constant is \\\\frac{\\\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} where \\"t_{1/2}\\" is the half-life of the radioactive material of interest. Example The decay correct might be used this way: a group of 20 animals is injected with a compound of interest on a Monday at 10:00 a.m. The compound is chemically joined to the isotope copper-64, which has a known half-life of 12.7 hours, or 764 minutes. After one hour, the 5 animals in the \\"one hour\\" group are killed, dissected, and organs of interest are placed in sealed containers to await measurement. This is repeated for another 5 animals, at 2 hours, and again at 4 hours. At this point, (say, 4:00 p.m., Monday) all the organs collected so far are measured for radioactivity (a proxy of the distribution of the compound of interest). The next day (Tuesday), the \\"24 hour\\" group would be killed and dissected at 10:00 a.m., then measured for radioactivity, (say at 11:00 a.m.). In order to compare ALL the groups together, the data from the \\"24 hour\\" must be decay corrected: the radioactivity measured on the second day must be \\"adjusted\\" in order to allow a comparison to measurements from an earlier time, but of the same original material. In this case, \\"time zero\\" is Monday, 4:00 p.m., when the first three groups (1,2, and 4 hour animals organs) were measured. The \\"24 hour\\" group was measured at 11:00 a.m. Tuesday, which is 19 hours after the first groups. Start by calculating the decay constant \\"K\\". Substitute 12.7 (hours, the half- life of copper-64) for t_{1/2} , giving {0.693 \\\\over 12.7} = 0.0546. Next, multiply this value of \\"K\\" by the time elapsed between the first and second measures of radioactivity, 19 hours: (0.0546 x 19) = 1.0368. Change the sign, to make it -1.0368, then find the \\"inverse Ln\\"; in this case 0.3546. This value is in the denominator of the decay correcting fraction, so it is the same as multiplying the numerator by its inverse ( {1 \\\\over 0.3546} ), which is 2.82. (A simple way to check if you are using the decay correct formula right is to put in the value of the half-life in place of \\"t\\". After you perform the inverse Ln, the value should be very close to 0.5. When divided into the value \\"A\\" (for uncorrected counts), it effectively doubles them, which is the necessary correction after one half-life has occurred.) In this case, the uncorrected values will be multiplied by 2.82, which corrects for 19 hours elapsing (between one and two half-lives). If the radiation measured has dropped by half between the 4 hour sample and the 24 hour sample we might think that the concentration of compound in that organ has dropped by half; but applying the decay correct we see that the concentration is 0.5*2.82 so it has actually increased by 40% in that period.

Nicholas William Bethell, 4th Baron Bethell (19 July 1938 ‚Äì 8 September 2007) was a British politician. He was a historian of Central and Eastern Europe. He was also a translator and human rights activist. He sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative from 1967 to 1999. He served as an appointed member of the European Assembly from 1975 to 1979, and as an elected Member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1994, and from 1999 to 2003. Early life Bethell's parents were William Gladstone Bethell (11 April 1904 ‚Äì 17 October 1964) and Ann Margaret Frances (n√©e Barlow; died 17 August 1996). His father was a stockbroker who served in the Royal Artillery in the Second World War. His father was the third son of John Bethell, a banker and Liberal politician, who became 1st Baron Bethell in 1922. His mother was the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Barlow. His parents divorced in 1946. His mother subsequently remarried three times. Education Bethell was educated at Harrow. He trained as a Russian interpreter during his National Service from 1956 to 1958, and studied Oriental Languages at Pembroke College, Cambridge, specialising in Arabic and Persian. He graduated in 1962, and befriended Polish students in Cambridge. He resumed his education at Cambridge as a mature student, and earned his PhD in 1987. Political and literary career After he graduated, Bethell worked for the Times Literary Supplement from 1962 to 1964, and was a script editor for the BBC Radio Drama department from 1964 to 1967. =The protest of 88 and Index on Censorship= Professor emeritus at Georgetown University Peter Reddaway describes in some detail the role of Bethell and his close acquaintance Alexander Dolberg in \\"sabotaging samizdat\\".\\"Confronting the Naysayers in the West\\", The Dissidents: A Memoir of Working with the Resistance in Russia, 1960-1990, Brookings Institution Press: Washington D.C., 2020, pp. 156-161. In 1968, for instance, Bethell supplied The Sunday Times with the text of a long, anonymous protest against the invasion of Czechoslovakia (published by The Sunday Times on 11 September) which was signed, so he asserted, by \\"88 of the leading Moscow progressive writers\\". The BBC and Radio Liberty were offered the same text by Dolberg (under his pen name \\"David Burg\\") but, unlike The Sunday Times, did not agree to publicize it. At a time when prominent writers, scientists and public figures throughout the USSR had openly signed letters of protest against the January 1968 trial of Alexander Ginzburg and Yury Galanskov,\\"Protests about the Trial\\", A Chronicle of Current Events, 1.2 (30 April 1968). and eight rights activists had demonstrated on 25 August that year on Red Square against the invasion of Czechoslovakia a few days earlier,A Chronicle of Current Events, 3 (30 August 1968). the \\"anonymous protest\\" was regarded, at the least, as a hoax. Neither its author nor any more than three of its signatories were subsequently identified. One consequence of this debacle was that Michael Scammell rather than Nicholas Bethell was chosen in 1971 to be director of Writers and Scholars International,Reddaway, The Dissidents: A Memoir of Working with the Resistance in Russia, 1960-1990, Brookings Institution Press: Washington D.C., 2020, pp. 159-161. the new NGO which founded the quarterly Index on Censorship periodical. =House of Lords= Nicholas Bethell's father died in 1964, and he inherited the barony on the unexpected early death of his cousin Guy on 2 December 1967. He sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative until the House of Lords Act 1999 removed most hereditary peers from the chamber. He was appointed as a Lord in Waiting (a government whip in the House of Lords) in June 1970, after the 1970 general election. =Controversy= Fluent in Russian and Polish, Bethell often translated the works of Russian and Polish writers into English. After he published a translation in 1968, together with David Burg, of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Ward, an article by Auberon Waugh in Private Eye (1971) suggested Bethell had published the work without permission, and had enabled the Soviet authorities to arrest Solzhenitsyn for circulating anti-Soviet propaganda. Bethell brought a libel suit against Private Eye and resigned as a whip in January 1971 to pursue the litigation. (The case was eventually settled out of court.) The controversy denied him a place on Edward Heath's list of Conservative candidates to be appointed to the European Parliament. Heath refused to discuss the matter with him, but government papers released in 2002 under the 30-year rule revealed that Bethell's contacts with people in Communist Russia and Poland were thought to be a security risk. Solzhenitsyn reopened the issue after he was deported from the Soviet Union, claiming that he had not authorised a Slovak dissident, Pavel Licko, to give the manuscript to Bethell, and that Licko was a Soviet agent. Licko's side of the story was given, many years later, in an issue of the Kritika i Kontekst magazine.Samuel Abraham, \\"Pavel Licko, the first political prisoner after 1968\\", Kritika i kontekst, 9 December 2014. Bethell rejected these claims, pointing out that Solzhenitsyn had accepted royalties from the publication of the translation over the years. Solzhenitsyn first came to Western attention with the publication in the USSR of \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\" (1962) and its subsequent translation into many languages (it was translated at least five times into English). Thereafter, reports of his literary activities and constant harassment by the authorities kept him in the public eye.\\"About Alexander Solzhenitsyn\\", A Chronicle of Current Events (Issue 2, 30 June 1968). In 1970 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, although the Soviet authorities obstructed him from receiving the award\\"On the presentiation of the Nobel Prize to Solzhenitsyn\\", A Chronicle of Current Events (Issue 25, 20 May 1972). until he was deported from the USSR in 1974. =European Parliament= Bethell's political fortunes changed when Margaret Thatcher became leader of the Conservative Party. He was nominated to become a member of the European Parliament from 1975 to 1979, and sat as an elected MEP for London Northwest from 1979 to 1994. He set up the \\"Freedom of the Skies\\" in 1980, campaigning to force airlines to reduce their prices which he believed were artificially inflated by a cartel. Perceived as too European, he was not re-elected in 1994, but returned to the European Parliament as an MEP for the new regional constituency of London at the 1999 European Parliament election. At the same election, his second wife Bryony was an unsuccessful candidate on the Conservative Party list for the South East England seat. Bethell was awarded the European People's Party's Robert Schuman Medal on his retirement from the European Parliament in October 2003. Bethell was staunchly anti-communist. In such books as Betrayed, he strongly supported the Anglo- American efforts to overthrow the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe. What Bethell criticised was the execution of such operations, not their goal. He used his European post to campaign for the human rights of dissidents in the Soviet bloc, including Andrei Sakharov and Anatoly Sharansky. He took a leading role in the foundation of the Sakharov Prize, awarded by the European Parliament since 1988. After the fall of Communism, he continued to support critics of the Russian government, such as Vladimir Gusinsky and Alexander Litvinenko. He was also one of the first people to interview Nelson Mandela at Pollsmoor Prison in 1985. Awards He became a Commander of the Polish Order of Merit in 1991, and received a Russian Presidential Award in 1992. Bethell was the president of the Uxbridge Conservative Association from 1995 to 1999. He was active in the movement to keep Gibraltar British, serving as president of the Friends of Gibraltar's Heritage from 1992 to 2001. For this he received the Freedom of the City of Gibraltar and the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour in 2008. He also opposed the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus, and was president of the Friends of Cyprus Association from 2001. Private life Bethell married twice. He married, firstly, Cecilia Mary Lothian Honeyman on 7 April 1964. She was the daughter of Alexander Honeyman, professor of Oriental Languages at St Andrews University. They had two sons, James and William, but divorced in 1971; she died in 1977. He remarried in 1992, to Bryony Lea Morgan Griffiths. They had one son, John. They resided in London. He enjoyed playing tennis and poker, and was a member of the Garrick Club and Pratt's. He suffered from Parkinson's disease in later life, dying at age 69. He was survived by his second wife, and his three sons. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, James Bethell, 5th Baron Bethell.

Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building houses the main offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. It is located at 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., in Washington, D.C. The building, designed in the stripped classicism style, was designed by Paul Philippe Cret and completed in 1937. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the building on October 20, 1937. The building was named after Marriner S. Eccles (1890‚Äì1977), Chairman of the Federal Reserve under President Roosevelt, by an Act of Congress on October 15, 1982. Previously it had been known as the Federal Reserve Building. Architectural competition The Eccles Building under construction in 1936 The Eccles Building in 1937 From 1913 to 1937, the Federal Reserve Board met in the United States Treasury building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., while employees were scattered across three locations throughout the city. In response to the Banking Act of 1935, which centralized control of the Federal Reserve System and placed it in the hands of the Board, the Board decided to consolidate its growing staff in a new building, to be sited on Constitution Avenue and designed by an architect selected through an invited competition. The principal officials overseeing the competition were Charles Moore, chairman of the United States Commission of Fine Arts, and Adolph C. Miller, a member of the Board since 1914. Miller drafted a statement to help the competing architects understand the concerns of Board, explaining that the traditional style of public architecture ‚Äì with columns, pediments, and generous use of symbolic ornamentation ‚Äì would not be of the utmost concern. > In describing the character of the building as governmental, it is not, > however, intended to suggest that its monumental character should be > emphasized. It is thought desirable that its aesthetic appeal should be > through dignity of conception, proportion, scale and purity of line rather > than through stressing of purely decorative or monumental features. For this > reason it is suggested that the use of columns, pediments and other such > forms may be altogether omitted and should be restricted to the character of > the building as above described. Proposals were received from architects such as John Russell Pope and James Gamble Rogers. Ultimately, the winner of the competition was the simplified classical design by Paul Philippe Cret. The architect and the design Paul Philippe Cret was a naturalized U.S. citizen who had trained at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Lyons and Paris. He was invited to the United States in 1903 to establish the department of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, and established his own practice in 1907. Creole marble sample His first major commission was the Pan American Union Building, in Washington, D.C. (1908). Designed with Albert Kelsey, it was a building in quintessential Beaux-Arts style, with an impressive classical facade, rich ornamentation, and allegorical references to the goals of the organization. This led to many other commissions for war memorials, civic buildings, court houses, and museums in cities such as Detroit, Hartford, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C. By 1935, under the influence of Modernism, Cret's style had evolved toward the spare classicism of buildings such as the Folger Shakespeare Library (1929‚Äì32). But true to the Beaux-Arts tradition, he oversaw every aspect of the building project, including technical and aesthetic details. His firm made more than 300 freehand sketches, measured plans, site plans, elevational studies, and perspective drawings, each of which could contain front, side, and top views, and sectional details when necessary. The four-story building, with an exterior of Georgia marble, is in the shape of the letter H, with the space on either side of the building's center forming east and west courtyards. The interior has a two-story atrium with dual staircases and a skylight etched with the outline of an eagle. The atrium floor is of marble and its walls are of travertine marble. The largest meeting space is the two-story Board Room. Construction of the building began in 1935 and was completed in 1937. Its pragmatic classicism captured the spirit of Depression-era and wartime Washington, a city determined to remain grand but with nothing to spare on the non-essential. Ornamentation and furnishings Meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in the Board Room of the Eccles Building Cret employed nationally recognized artists to complete the ornamentation and furnishing of the building. Sidney Waugh designed the eagle on the front facade, the building's only three-dimensional sculpture which was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers, while John Gregory carved bas- reliefs for the exterior of the C Street entrance. Samuel Yellin, a noted wrought-iron craftsman from Philadelphia, designed and executed numerous railings, gates, and fixtures throughout the building. Milford pink granite was used as a building material. Mural artist Ezra Winter painted a large map of the United States for the Board Room, and sculptor Herbert Adams created memorials to President Woodrow Wilson and Senator Carter Glass to occupy niches in the main lobby. The furniture was produced by W. & J. Sloane, New York, with the architects having the final responsibility.

It is classified as critically endangered.Asian Turtle Trade Working Group 2000. Siebenrockiella leytensis. In: IUCN 2011. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2011.1. Retrieved on July 29, 2011 It is known as the Philippine forest turtle, the Philippine pond turtle, the Palawan turtle, or the Leyte pond turtle. Despite the latter common name, it does not occur in the island of Leyte but is instead native to the Palawan island group. It is locally known as bakoko in Cuyonon. Philippine forest turtles are readily recognizable by their ginkgo-shaped vertebral scutes and a pale white to yellow line traversing across its head behind the ears. The previous characteristic has earned it the nickname of 'bowtie turtle'. Philippine forest turtles are classified under the subgenus Panyaenemys. Together with the smiling terrapin (Siebenrockiella crassicollis), it is one of the two species in the genus Siebenrockiella. Description S. leytensis has a distinctive pale band of color running across the head just behind the ear openings. The anterior margin of the carapace of S. leytensis is slightly to strongly serrated. The distinctive ginkgo-shaped vertebral scutes of the Philippine forest turtle. Philippine forest turtles have brown to reddish brown to black carapaces that reach a length of . Larger individuals can reach in length, though this is relatively rare. A dorsal ridge (the keel) is only present in the posterior vertebral scutes or absent altogether. The front margin of the carapace is slightly to strongly serrated, with the marginal scutes projecting beyond the cervical scutes. The vertebral scutes are broader than long. The plastron is reddish brown to black, sometimes with blotches of yellow. In juveniles, the plastron is a uniform yellow. The bridge (the hinge connecting plastron and carapace) is the same color as the plastron. It is significantly smaller than the carapace and narrow at the front and back. It possesses deep notches between the projecting gular scutes as well as between the gulars and humerals, but it is more distinct in the former. Its plastral formula is abd > pect > fem > gul > hum > an. The skin of the legs, body, and neck are rough in appearance, being covered in tiny tubercles. The head is brown in color, sometimes speckled at the temples with light brown, orange, or red spots. A thin white to pale yellow line traverses through the width of the head just behind the openings of the ears, it may be divided at the center in some individuals. This has led to the species being nicknamed as the 'bowtie turtle'. The line is more prominent in younger individuals. Close-up of the head showing the hooked upper jaw. The upper jaw is hooked and the skin on the sides of the neck and the chin are lighter in color. The lower jaw may also sometimes possess a pair of small yellow spots on the sides. The legs possess irregular enlarged transverse scales and are darker in color at the front. Four transverse scales are present on the forelimbs and more at the hind limbs (though absent at the heels). All limbs are webbed and possess large claws on all toes. The tail is uniformly light brown in color. Philippine forest turtles are relatively easy to recognize. They can be distinguished from all other turtles by their strongly projecting epiplastra, vertebral scutes shaped like ginkgo leaves, the absence of temporal arches in the skull, and the aforementioned light lines behind its head. The Malaysian giant turtle (Orlitia borneensis) and the smiling terrapin (Siebenrockiella crassicollis) are the only other turtle species with ginkgo-shaped vertebral scutes, but they do not possess the white to pale yellow line on the back of their heads. Taxonomy and nomenclature The scientific name of Philippine forest turtles is Siebenrockiella leytensis. It is classified under the genus Siebenrockiella in the subgenus Panyaenemys (frequently misspelled as \\"Panayanemys\\" and \\"Panyanemys\\"). It belongs to the subfamily Geoemydinae of the family Geoemydidae.Turtles of the World: Annotated Checklist of Taxonomy and Synonymy, December 2010. Formerly classified under the genus Heosemys, it was transferred to the previously monotypic genus Siebenrockiella by Diesmos et al. in 2005 based on morphological and genetic comparison with Siebenrockiella crassicollis. The subgenus name is derived after the Pala'wan word panya-en. The word was used by a local Palawan resident to describe the turtles in a 2003 survey. The word means 'enchanted', supposedly because Philippine forest turtles were favorite pets of the forest spirits. -emys comes from the Greek word ŒµŒºœçœÇ, meaning 'freshwater turtle'. The generic name was coined in honor of the Austrian zoologist Friedrich Siebenrock. While the specific name means 'from [the island of] Leyte'. An erroneous name, as the turtle is actually from the islands of Palawan and is not found in Leyte. History of discovery Philippine forest turtles were first described by the American herpetologist Edward Harrison Taylor in 1920 as Heosemys leytensis. He described them on the basis of two specimens (male and female) collected by Gregorio Lopez, allegedly from the swamps of the municipality of Cabalian in Southern Leyte (now known as the municipality of San Juan). These specimens were unfortunately destroyed in World War II during the firebombing of Manila. No other specimens were reported until 1988 when a specimen was bought from a local resident in Taytay, Palawan. Believing that the turtle got there through interisland trade, numerous herpetologists searched Southern Leyte for other individuals. Their lack of success led to fears that the turtle was already extinct. In 2001, during an assessment of endemic wildlife of the island of Palawan, live specimens of Philippine forest turtles were rediscovered. It soon became apparent that natural populations of the species existed in Palawan. Diesmos et al. (2004) have concluded that Taylor and/or Lopez may have somehow confused the type locality of the original specimens. Lopez also collected turtle specimens from the islands of Coron and Busuanga in Palawan. Specimens from Palawan may have been mistakenly exchanged with actual specimens from Leyte (which were probably Cyclemys dentata). It is now presumed that Philippine forest turtles have never been introduced outside of Palawan, and thus were not actually from Leyte. Distribution and habitat Philippine forest turtles are known only from northern Palawan and surrounding islands. This includes the island of Dumaran where the species is still relatively abundant in creeks. Elsewhere, it is believed their populations are declining sharply. Particularly in the areas of Taytay and San Vicente. Its distribution area is estimated to be less than 100 km2.Sabine Schoppe and Chris R. Shepherd (2013): \\"The Palawan Forest Turtle Under Threat from International Trade\\", in Traffic Bulletin, Vol.25, No.1, pg.9-11 Ecology and behavior Philippine forest turtle populations often exist alongside other more common native turtle species, including Asian leaf turtles (Cyclemys dentata) and Southeast Asian box turtles (Cuora amboinensis). Due to its rarity and its status as newly rediscovered, little is known of the life cycle of the Philippine forest turtle. From observations, however, Philippine forest turtles appear to exhibit long life spans and high adult survival rates. Like most turtles, their sexual maturation is delayed but they are able to mate multiple times before death (iteroparity). Captive adults confiscated from illegal traders were provided a large outside pool with well planted islands and numerous underwater rock formations in Malabon Zoo in Manila. But they proved to be very shy and retiring, spending considerable time hiding under rocks, both in and out of the water. They took some months to adjust to confinement. Observations indicate that they are omnivorous, favouring commercial turtle food, aquatic plants and they have been observed hunting small fish and crustaceans. They became active in the early morning and late evening, foraging for food, and moved about during the night. They were not observed to be keen on basking in the sun, but this may have been the result of being in a captive environment. Known food sources of Philippine forest turtles in the wild include figs. Threats The Philippine forest turtle is an enigmatic freshwater turtle species, it exerts great fascination for turtle hobbyists. Due to the previous inability to locate it in the wild, probable threats from habitat loss, and potential pressure from collectors, this turtle is listed as critically endangered. Due to the susceptibility of the species to stress and the extremely aggressive territorial behavior of male individuals, Philippine forest turtles do not do well in captivity. Nevertheless, as of 2009, a considerable number of these turtles (over 171 individuals documented in a span of four years) were to be found for sale illegally in major Manila pet markets, particularly in the main Chinese markets (where the turtles are sold cheaper). The animals are not sold openly and some of the buyers are overseas collectors. Most of the individuals were juveniles or young adults. Between 2009-2011 this species ranked sixth among the most commonly confiscated species in the Philippines. These animals had been collected from mud wallows in northern Palawan, and it is believed that they hide during the daylight hours. Additionally, many specimens (from Palawan) offered for sale had small holes bored in the carapace, indicating that some at least had been held captive as pets and tethered accordingly. Local Palawan people are known to keep these animals in water troughs for domestic pigs, as these are supposed to bring luck for the household and the pigs, although it is not known if this luck is shared by the turtles. The unconfirmed existence of illegal trade of Palawan turtles to Borneo, Malaysia, is also a cause of concern. Conservation Although some studies into their habitats have been commenced by several Philippines academic institutions, lack of funding has prevented full study, and they must be still considered endangered, especially from collecting, until further research had been carried out. Trade is banned internationally under the CITES convention, as well as domestically under the Philippines Wildlife Act. Some eighteen individuals have been donated to the Malabon Zoo north of Manila. Recent legislation in the Philippines requires pet owners and traders to register their animals with the authorities, and pay for licences to keep the more \\"exotic\\" pets. It is hoped that this may prove to reduce the collection of various endangered species, including the Philippines Pond Turtle. The entirety of the Palawan group of islands is also a nationally protected area.

Soldiers from DR Congo have been known to cross and harass the population on occasion, making people here more on edge than usual. The entire western side of the Congo River in the Likouala is also home to refugee camps, though as the conflict in DR Congo subsides, they should be making their way back across the river. To the west of Impfondo lies the Lac Tele area of the tropical jungle.

In practice, actuality films preceded the emergence of the documentary. During the era of early cinema, actualities‚Äîusually lasting no more than a minute or two and usually assembled together into a program by an exhibitor‚Äîwere just as popular and prominent as their fictional counterparts.American Memory, \\"The Actuality Film\\" The line between \\"fact\\" and \\"fiction\\" was not so sharply drawn in early cinema as it would become after the documentary came to serve as the predominant non- fiction filmmaking form. An actuality film is not like a newspaper article so much as it is like the still photograph that is published along with the article, with the major difference being that it moves. Apart from the traveling actuality genre, actuality is one film genre that remains strongly related to still photography. Despite the demise of the actuality as a film genre around 1908, one still refers to \\"actuality footage\\" as a building block of documentary filmmaking. In such usage, actuality refers to the raw footage that the documentarist edits and manipulates to create the film. Beginnings A still from La sortie des usines Lumi√®re (Workers Leaving the Lumi√®re Factory, 1895) The first actuality films date to the time of the very emergence of projected cinema. The Lumi√®re Brothers in France were the principal advocates for this genre and also coined the term ‚Äî \\"Actualit√©s\\" ‚Äî and used it as a descriptor in the printed catalogues of their films. La sortie des usines Lumi√®re (1895) ‚Äî the first film exhibited by the Lumi√®res‚Äîis by default the earliest actuality film; it might have not been the first one made, but it was definitively the first one shown publicly, on December 28, 1895. Although the Thomas A. Edison, Inc. in the United States was producing films and exhibiting them via the Kinetoscope going back to 1893, the films themselves were studio-bound creations made in Edison's makeshift movie studio the Black Maria; although Bucking Broncho (1894) was the first Edison subject to be filmed outdoors, it necessitated the construction of a special pen next to the Black Maria. The Edison, and early Biograph, motion picture cameras were bulky, engineering-heavy designs that could not be lifted or carried by a single person and required transport by way of horse cart. The Lumi√®re cameras‚Äîfrom the very start‚Äîwere small, light and also functioned as projectors. The Paul-Acres camera, registered in Britain in 1895, was likewise a smaller and more readily portable device than the Edison model, and Birt Acres filmed The Derby (1895) on it in May. But this, and Paul's other films, were not projected in public until February 1896.\\"Pioneers: Robert Paul\\" at EarlyCinema.com Edison's first principal film producer W. K. L. Dickson broke away from the company late 1895 in order to act as partner in his own concern, American Mutoscope and Biograph, which by 1897 had a founded a British subsidiary that Dickson headed.Gordon Hendricks, \\"Origins of the American Film,\\" New York: Arno Press, New York Times 1972 Although their cameras were even bulkier than Edison's at first, utilizing 68mm film, Biograph's very first subjects ‚Äî a series of views of Niagara Falls ‚Äî were actualities, although studio bound subjects dominate the Biograph's years before 1900. Other pre-1900 concerns such as Selig (Chicago), Lubin (Philadelphia), Vitagraph (New York), M√©li√®s Star-Film, Path√© Fr√®res and Gaumont (France) and Warwick Trading Company (UK) all made actuality films, though in varying degrees in relation to films made in other genres. Lumi√®re genres It was the Lumi√®res, however, that set the pace for most of the history of the actuality. Lumi√®re films ran for the duration of the film strip in the camera, which was a uniform 50-second length. Lumi√®re cameramen were trained to shoot in a specific type of framing and to keep an eye out for certain kinds of action. Louis Lumi√®re personally approved every subject released and rejected about 500 films made for the company that did not meet his standards. They were consciously building a document of the world around them in 50-second shots, and Lumi√®re cameramen had the greatest reach worldwide of any motion picture company in the business, filming in Asia, Africa and other hard to get places. They were careful to preserve and properly store their films, and all but 18 of the 1,423 films they made have survived. When the Lumi√®re films as a whole were submitted to the \\"Memory of the World\\" register at UNESCO, they were subdivided into the following categories. * military events * everyday scenes * official events * fiction (comic or historical) * circus or music- hall entertainment * The Lumi√®re family The first three descriptors nearly encompass the whole of the subject matter represented in actuality films, to which may be added \\"news events,\\" though these were relatively rare, as it was difficult for any motion picture cameraman to make it, with his equipment, to an actual news event in a timely fashion, leading to the advent of recreations. Nevertheless, both Vitagraph and Biograph released subjects filmed in Galveston after the hurricane of 1900; the aftermath of the San Francisco Earthquake was likewise filmed by at least three companies. The Lumi√®res never shared their camera system‚Äîwith its 35mm film and round perforations‚Äîwith anyone. But Path√© did begin to market its smaller, lighter camera to cinematographers around 1903, and even some cameramen employed by Edison and Biograph began to use them in defiance to the patent cameras owned by the companies that employed them. Biograph relented in 1903, discontinuing use of 68mm and adopting the increasingly universal 35mm format at this time. The significance of this was that it then became easier for film makers to shoot actuality films across the board, though the heyday of the genre was soon to pass. Traveling actualities A special kind of actuality film is the traveling actuality, in which a camera is placed on a kind of conveyance‚Äîsuch as a bus, or rail car‚Äîso that the scene can change by virtue of the movement of the vehicle which is transporting the camera. These films were the first in which camera movement is involved, and a very early entry is James H. White's' Panoramic View of the Champs Elysees (1900), which appears to have been shot from a horse-drawn carriage. British Biograph's Panorama of Ealing from a Moving Tram (1901) is remarkable for its slow pace, high angle and the widescreen aspect of the 68mm film, whereas Danish film maker Thomas S. Hermanson's Sporvognene i √Örhus (1904) is remarkable for its speed and odd angles. Some extreme‚Äîalmost avant-garde‚Äîexamples come from Biograph; Frederick S. Armitage and A. E. Weed's Down the Hudson (1903), shot largely in single frames, and several films by G. W. Billy Bitzer, Interior N.Y. Subway, 14th St. to 42nd St (1905), which was shot from the front of a New York City Subway car shortly after the system first opened. The most remarkable traveling actuality of all is the Miles Brothers' Trip Down Market Street Before the Fire (1906), which was shot on a San Francisco streetcar and literally dropped off for processing on the day before the earthquake and fire destroyed San Francisco. At nearly eight minutes' length, Trip Down Market Street Before the Fire is also one of the longest actuality films. Related genres Certain types of early films lumped into the actuality genre are merely related forms and do not entirely belong to the designation. While sporting events‚Äîparticularly boat and yacht races‚Äîfigure into the actuality genre, fight films constitute a genre unto themselves. The first fight films, such as Edison's The Hornbacker-Murphy Fight (1894) actually precede the advent of actualities altogether and, as the genre evolved through 1916, consisted of a mixture of actual, recreated and staged bouts. The fixed camera position common in early cinema was a good match for taking in even many rounds of boxing, and interest in such subjects was further supported by the fact that boxing itself was illegal in most places, and the films provided access to such entertainment where live boxing matches were prohibited by law.Dan Strieble - Fight Pictures: A History of Boxing and Early Cinema. University of California Press, 2008; Recreations of various kinds typify early kinds of news coverage; as the camera could not be brought to so many events of public significance or interest, the events were brought before the cameras, with actors and/or models of various kinds employed. This was especially common during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War; although cameras were dispatched to the front in Cuba, the footage sent back was often disappointing, so it was more effective to find a setting in New Jersey and to restage the battle scenes with actors. These films were often promoted to exhibitors and the public alike as the real thing, but \\"recreations\\" are inherently oxymoronic in relation to \\"actualities.\\" Decline In 1904, American born English filmmaker Charles Urban made Everyday London, a 12-minute travelogue designed to provide views of England to Australians. This is a full-fledged documentary; although rather roughly assembled, it consists of a great many short shots and is clearly shaped in the manner of a documentary. In 1905, the Lumi√®res ended their production of actualities, and within the next couple of years, major producers such as Edison and Biograph began to abandon the actuality genre; by 1907, American Biograph was no longer making them, and new start up companies such as Kalem never produced them at all, concentrating instead on fiction films with actors. When Gaston M√©li√®s arrived in the United States to found the American division of Star Film, he started out making actualities, but swiftly moved into making Westerns. This left production of actualities to smaller producers such as Mitchell and Kenyon in the UK, a company that made no other kinds of films, although Path√© soldiered on among the majors. In mid-1908, French Path√© introduced the first newsreel.British Path√©, \\"History of British Path√©\\" The newsreel was a format in which actualities could be combined, and it provided a context for the views that was timely. Also that year, Charles Urban founded the Kinora Company, the first company established for the exclusive purpose of distributing documentaries and other kinds of non-fiction films. Although it is not altogether impossible to find actuality films made after 1910, the shift towards documentaries and newsreels rendered the genre irrelevant both commercially and artistically. Legacy In a commercial sense, the actuality is of no more worth than its value as stock footage to use in documentaries. Some documentaries have been fashioned from early actualities and passed off as historic without further comment, such as a compilation entitled The San Francisco Earthquake which is rendered in a way that makes the original source material impossible to divine.American Memory, \\"San Francisco Earthquake and Fire, April 18, 1906\\" However, actuality films are an inherent part of the development of early motion pictures and the genre deserves study in its own right; the UNESCO Lumi√®re project, BFI's Mitchell and Kenyon collection and certain films in the Library of Congress paper print collection remain the only studies in the genre conducted in a systematic way. The sheer numbers of such films are part of the problem; early actuality films exist in the thousands, and many remain unidentified. Although actuality films may have disappeared from movie theaters, actuality footage, especially from video, has had considerable impact in the digital era. One late 20th century actuality video seen thousands of times on television in the months leading up to the LA consumer riots of 1993 was the police beating of Rodney King, filmed by an amateur through the front window of their residence. The advent of YouTube has led to some resurgence of interest in actuality styled film and video apart from \\"home movies,\\" and the web has seen the advent of home-based webcams pointed out the window, and other things resulting from the easy availability of access to digital video. Whereas early film makers would shoot film after film and never have to proffer a single release form, the legal implications in the digital era are different; there is now a thin line between actuality filming and unwanted surveillance. Artist and filmmaker James Nares was inspired by actuality films from the 1890s to create his 61-minute, non- fiction film Street in 2011. Out of 16 hours of footage captured on Manhattan streets with an ultra-highspeed camera, Nares selected and edited together just 2 minutes and 40 seconds of real-time film, slowed to roughly a twentieth of its original speed. \\"Framed as a montage of events rather than as a linear narrative, Street pulls our attention toward individuals among the masses that crowd the city‚Äôs sidewalks.\\" Noted filmmakers Alfred C.

This led to his selection by the Houston Astros as the first overall pick of the 1976 amateur draft. After pitching just seven games in the minors in , Bannister opened the season with the Astros. He appeared in 24 games with an 8-9 record and a 4.04 earned run average. He spent one more season with the Astros before being traded to the Seattle Mariners. He spent four years in Seattle, with his last year there being perhaps his best. Bannister was selected to the 1982 All-Star Game and led the American League with 209 strikeouts, his career best. In 1983 and 1985, he led the American League in strikeouts per nine innings with averages of 8.0 and 8.5, respectively. After that season, Bannister became a free agent, signing with the Chicago White Sox. He spent five seasons there as a solid starting pitcher. He then moved on to the Kansas City Royals, where he had another solid season in . However, in June he suffered an injury which knocked him out for the rest of the year. Finding no takers on the free agent market, Bannister went to Japan in , playing for the Yakult Swallows. He signed a minor league contract with the California Angels in , where he was converted into a reliever. After one last season with the Texas Rangers in , Bannister was released in August, ending his professional career. Armed with a strong fastball, an excellent slider, and above average curveball, Bannister recorded an average of 6.49 strikeouts per nine innings in his career, but was also shuffled between six different teams in his 15-year career. He gave up more than 30 home runs in four different seasons and was followed by criticism for a reluctance to move hitters off the plate by pitching inside. In a 15-year major league career, Bannister compiled a 134-143 record, with a 4.06 ERA in 431 games (363 starts). He had 62 complete games in his career, along with 16 shutouts.

History The scene was heavily influenced by Madchester, although it was not geographically confined to the city of Manchester. Many Madchester bands could also be described as baggy, and vice versa. Baggy was characterised by psychedelia and acid house-influenced guitar music, often with a \\"funky drummer\\" beat, similar to the work of the Happy Mondays, Northside and The Stone Roses. The scene was named after the loose-fitting clothing worn by the bands and fans. Some bands, such as The Mock Turtles and The Soup Dragons, reinvented their sound and image to fit in with the new scene. This led some critics to accuse baggy bands of bandwagon-jumping and derivative songwriting. There was also a crossover between dance and indie, and vice versa. Bands in the alternative dance era of pop music can be divided into two camps; the acts who could be described as baggy (usually the Madchester acts and a few others such as Flowered Up from London), and those who can be described as alternative dance (i.e. Jesus Jones and The Shamen, who were more techno inspired). The Shamen would begin as a psychedelic indie rock band, sharing some of the characteristics of early shoegaze bands, but their style would morph between psychedelic indie rock and acid house, before absorbing more elements of techno. Clothing Alongside the music, a way of dressing emerged that gave baggy its name. Baggy jeans (often flared) alongside brightly coloured or tie-dye casual tops and general '60s style became fashionable first in Manchester and then across the country ‚Äì frequently topped off with a fishing hat in the style sported by the Stone Roses' drummer Reni. The overall look was part rave, part retro or part hippie, part football casual. Many Madchester bands had football casual fans and a number of bands even wore football shirts. Eaitisham Ahmed's Manchester- based Joe Bloggs fashion label specialised in catering for the scene, making him a multi-millionaire. It is also generally accepted that French stylists Marith√© et Fran√ßois Girbaud were one of the first designers to integrate baggy in fashion industry.  Legacy  Some baggy bands evolved into indie rock or Britpop bands who remained popular throughout the 1990s. The Charlatans retained their popularity, although little trace of the baggy sound and look remained. The baggy style was eclipsed by the grunge and Britpop genres. Apart from tribute acts, the style has been absent from the indie arena, with acts like the 2001 Manchester band Waterfall failing to interest record companies with their revival sound. Another wave of bands in the style of the past baggy Madchester sound is currently in process. Bands such as Kasabian, Reverend and the Makers, The Ruling Class, Sulk, The Bavarian Druglords, and Working For A Nuclear Free City have brought back aspects of the style in various forms and have garnered comparisons to The Stone Roses and the Madchester sound. Clothes wise the flares may not be in fashion but the designer names and sport casual look can still be seen in the Baggymod look.

Created by Doug Moench and Tom Mandrake, the character debuted in Batman #386 (August, 1985). He is commonly depicted as a brutal and ruthless crime lord in Gotham City who has a fixation with masks and derives sadistic pleasure from the act of torture. Black Mask is one of the most enduring enemies of the superhero Batman and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including the cartoon show The Batman, the animated film Batman: Under the Red Hood, and the Batman: Arkham video game series. Black Mask made his live-action debut in the 2020 DC Extended Universe film Birds of Prey, portrayed by Ewan McGregor. Fictional character biography =Origin story= Black Mask's origin story was established in his first appearance. Roman Sionis was born to wealthy and utterly self-absorbed parents, who cared more about their social status in Gotham City than their own son. Moments after Roman's birth, the doctor carelessly dropped him on his head, and his parents covered up the entire incident so that their high society friends would not find out. Years later, he was attacked by a rabid raccoon at the Sionis family country estate, and his parents forbade him to mention the incident to anyone. Despite their dislike for fellow socialites Thomas and Martha Wayne, Roman's parents continued to associate with them to maintain their social standing, and forced Roman to befriend their son, Bruce. His parents' hypocrisy had a deep impact on Roman, and he grew to resent them and the \\"masks\\" that they wore in public. After graduating from high school, Roman was given a high-ranking position in his father's company, Janus Cosmetics. There, he met and fell in love with working class model Circe, though his parents did not approve of the relationship and forced him to break it off. Enraged, Roman burned down his family mansion, killing both of his parents and inheriting their fortune and business. Roman lacked his father's business acumen and eventually ruined Janus Cosmetics by funding a failed line of face-paint make-up. Desperate, Roman had the staff chemists create a product that was rushed to the market without proper testing, disfiguring several hundred women. Circe, now Roman's fianc√©e, then broke up with him in front of his entire staff. Bruce Wayne, now the head of Wayne Enterprises, offered to bail Janus Cosmetics out on the condition that Roman gave up control and allowed Wayne to appoint his own Board of Directors. Humiliated and furious, Roman broke into the cemetery where his parents were buried. Before he could unlock the Sionis crypt, a lightning bolt struck him, blasting the door open and hurling Roman head-first into a nearby stone. Roman took the incident as an omen of his \\"rebirth\\" and entered the crypt, smashing his father's ebony casket with the stone and using its shattered pieces to carve a skull-like mask, starting a new life as the crimelord Black Mask. =Criminal career= Within a month, Black Mask had assembled a group of dozens of criminals called the False Face Society, using the Sionis crypt as their base of operations. Each member of the False Face Society wore a distinctive mask, and the gang's crime spree spread rapidly throughout Gotham, eventually attracting the attentions of the police and Bruce Wayne, now operating as the vigilante Batman. To settle old scores, Black Mask murdered three Wayne Foundation executives and kidnapped Circe, forcing her to don a mask laced with Janus Cosmetics' toxic makeup, sparing her life but permanently disfiguring her face. Black Mask then threatened Circe into rejoining him, giving her a \\"mannequin\\" mask intentionally designed to mock her former life. Batman eventually managed to deduce Black Mask's identity, and correctly predicted that Bruce Wayne would be Sionis' next target. To set a trap for Black Mask, Bruce held a masquerade ball at Wayne Manor, and Sionis infiltrated the ball and lured Bruce to the mansion's conservatory to kill him. Bruce disarmed Sionis, forcing the latter to retreat to his hideout with Robin (Jason Todd) secretly following him. While Batman and Robin fought his underlings at the graveyard, Black Mask escaped through a false bottom installed in his father's coffin and headed to his family estate. Black Mask then entered his old bedroom and set fire to the old toys inside, intending to burn the mansion to the ground to symbolically kill his old identity as Sionis. Before Black Mask could escape, Batman flung a Batarang- attached cable around the crime lord's knees, causing him to fall face-first on the burning floor just as the bedroom's rafters began to collapse. The rafters pinned Black Mask's face into the pile of burning toys, and although Batman and Robin were able to tow him out of the fire, Sionis' mask had been burned onto his face. Black Mask was subsequently sent to Arkham Asylum, where he remained behind bars until the international terrorist Ra's al Ghul freed all of its inmates. Black Mask was not amongst the criminals who followed the Joker in searching for the one behind the breakout and thus never took part in the \\"war\\" against Batman's allies and loved ones. As this tale was the last \\"canonical\\" one to take place on Earth-One, it can be assumed that Black Mask remained at large.Batman #400 Following Crisis on Infinite Earths, Jeremiah Arkham frees all of Arkham Asylum's inmates, including Black Mask, to attack Batman during the events of \\"The Last Arkham\\". Sionis then returns to crime after an unspecified breakout, evidently retaining most of his Pre-Crisis history. He soon begins the False Face Society anew, rising through the ranks of Gotham City's underworld while furthering his vendetta against Bruce Wayne. To stop the False Face Society, Batman poses as a new recruit to their ranks, christened \\"Skullface\\" by Black Mask himself. Black Mask later kidnaps Lucius Fox, who had a hand in Bruce Wayne's bailout of Janus Cosmetics. Although Batman is eventually able to save Fox, Black Mask manages to evade capture.Batman #485-486 Black Mask remains at large throughout the events of \\"Knightfall\\" and \\"Zero Hour\\", and resurfaces shortly thereafter to kill rival mobster \\"Dirty Dan\\" Doyle in an ambush shootout.Detective Comics #684 Black Mask is later approached by the Black Spider, who wishes to join the False Face Society. Black Mask demands the young man to \\"make his bones\\" first by crashing a masquerade ball being held at Wayne Manor. Batman later learns that the Black Spider is a double agent working for mobster \\"Turk\\" Ottoman, and tracks him down to an abandoned theater where he prevents him from shooting Black Mask, who subsequently escapes during the chaos.Batman #518-520 Black Mask reappears as a crimelord in \\"The Cult\\" storyline, having given up his vendetta against Bruce Wayne. He controls a large portion of Gotham's criminal underworld until the city is destroyed by an earthquake in the \\"No Man's Land\\" story arc. Black Mask later becomes the leader of a cult, whose trademark is ritual scarring, until Batman and the Huntress dissolve it by defeating and imprisoning Black Mask in Blackgate Penitentiary, though the crime lord escapes before the city is made a part of the country again. In Catwoman #16, Black Mask begins a drug trafficking ring and decides to move his organization into Gotham's East End. Catwoman soon begins interfering with Black Mask's plans, stealing money from him and giving it to the poor. Black Mask retaliates by forcing Sylvia Sinclair to reveal Catwoman's secret identity to him. After destroying Catwoman's youth center, Black Mask kidnaps her sister and brother-in-law, the latter of whom he tortures to death with power tools, before forcing the former to eat pieces of her husband's corpse, including his eyeballs. Catwoman arrives to find her brother-in-law dead, her sister insane, and her friend Holly Robinson on the verge of being tortured. Enraged, Catwoman engages Black Mask at his penthouse, where the crime lord falls from the top of the building. In Act Two of War Games, the Spoiler seeks Orpheus out, hoping to get Batman control of all of Gotham's crime lords. However, Black Mask murders Orpheus by slitting his throat, and proceeds to torture the Spoiler to obtain information about the rest of her plan. Black Mask then assumes Orpheus' identity using face putty and padding, fooling even Batman and Onyx. As Orpheus, he goes on a mission to kill any member or associate of the Batman Family. As Black Mask returns to continue torturing the Spoiler for entertainment, he finds that she has escaped and subsequently tracks her down. Although she escapes his clutches once again, the Spoiler supposedly dies due to the injuries inflicted on her and the willful negligence of Leslie Thompkins. Black Mask later infiltrates Oracle's Clocktower in an attempt to expose her to the mob, and Batman attacks him in a blind rage. Fearful that Black Mask will kill Batman, Oracle activates a self-destruct device in the tower to get Batman to save her. Black Mask then becomes the overlord of Gotham's underworld, gathering enough financial resources to purchase an Amazo android and a large supply of kryptonite. Allied with reporter Arturo Rodriguez, Black Mask begins a campaign to discredit Batman; while Rodriguez slams Batman in the press, Black Mask commits a series of murders disguised as the Dark Knight. The real Batman eventually exposes Rodriguez and captures Black Mask, but the crimelord kills the escorting officer transporting him to jail and escapes again.

Dotson finished fourth in the American League Cy Young Award voting, behind teammate LaMarr Hoyt. Arm injuries came to limit, however, what was a promising baseball career. In a 12-season career, Rich Dotson recorded a record of 111-113 with a 4.23 ERA in 305 games, 295 of them starts. He pitched 55 complete games and 11 shutouts in his career. Dotson gave up 872 earned runs and struck out 973 in 1857 and 1/3 innings pitched. Dotson was born in Cincinnati and attended Anderson High School. Dotson's biological father was Turk Farrell who played 14 MLB seasons. He was drafted out of high school by the California Angels in the summer of 1977, but was traded along with Bobby Bonds and Thad Bosley to the White Sox for Brian Downing, Chris Knapp and Dave Frost on December 5, 1977.Durso, Joseph. \\"Angels' Bonds Is Acquired By White Sox,\\" The New York Times, Tuesday, December 6, 1977.

White Sox manager Tony La Russa handed him the ball on September 4, 1979 as the starter for a game at Anaheim, but the 20-year-old Dotson retired only four Angels and left the park that day with a gaudy earned-run average of 33.75. By the next season, Dotson was a 12-game winner in the Chicago rotation. In 1981, he led the American League in shutouts with four. But his breakout season definitely was 1983. Dotson's 22 wins were the second-most in the league, and included 14 complete games. On the final day of the regular season, he and Dennis Lamp combined for a shutout at Seattle that put the White Sox in first place by a whopping 20 games over the nearest contender. The closest Dotson ever came to pitching a no-hitter was in a 1-0 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium on May 18, 1983. The Orioles' lone hit and the only run of the game was Dan Ford's one-out solo homer in the eighth inning that cleared the right-field foul pole by a few feet.Boswell, Thomas. \\"Ford's Homer Ruins Dotson's No-Hit Bid,\\" The Washington Post, Thursday, May 19, 1983.

The team was in first place for much of the season's first half, including in late July, before fading. Dotson had a strong finish, combining with two relievers on September 29 for a seven-hitter at Baltimore in his final start of the season.

Muhammad Sharif Khan studied at a madrasa in Delhi that was run by the sons of eminent religious scholar of the Naqshbandi order Shah Waliullah Dehlawi. He was the royal Hakim at the court of Mughal emperor Shah Alam II (ruled 1759-1806) who gave him the title Ashraf-al-Hukma (The Best of Physicians).

He was a prolific writer, and wrote some seventeen books on medicine, of which the most famous was \\"Elaaj al-Amraaz\\", (The Cures for Diseases) which is still considered a great source of reference in the field. He is also famous for compiling the most complete and authoritative collection of Unani medicinal formulas into one master work. He also translated the Quran into Urdu, which is widely regarded as the first translation of the Qur'an into that language. He was responsible for introducing aspects of European science in Unani medicine during that period, and he also composed works in Persian, as well as in Arabic, including a dictionary of Indian drugs.

Eder, a Democrat, lives in Biddeford. He is a former member of the Maine Green Independent Party, the Maine affiliate of the national Green Party. He served in the Maine House of Representatives as the legislature's first member of the Green Party for two terms and was elected in 2002 and re- elected in 2004. Until his defeat in 2006 Eder was one of only a handful of independent or third party state legislators in the country and was the highest-ranking elected Green official in the United States. Eder ran for Mayor of Portland, Maine in 2011.Rumors and Other Truths West End News In 2014, Eder won a race for an at-large seat on the Portland Board of Education. In 2018, Eder unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives. He claimed that \\"Democratic values\\" moved him to join the party. Eder had previously broken from Green Party tradition and supported Democrats while maintaining his Green voter registration, including future Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling. 2002 election to Maine House of Representatives Eder, then a Green Independent, won election with 65% of the vote, defeating a Democrat. Since legislators not enrolled with a political party typically caucus with one of the two major parties, it was assumed by Maine political observers that Eder would be forced to do the same. However, he was able to secure recognition of himself as a one-member Green Party caucus in the House. He negotiated to have a dedicated staff person assigned to him, something individual legislators in the Maine House, who serve on a part-time basis, do not have. With this Eder established the first ever Green Party Minority legislative office in any state. In his first session Eder introduced legislation to give tax incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles, a bill to create a single-payer health care system in Maine and another to limit corporate power. He passed legislation protecting schoolchildren from cancer-causing chemicals. This was the first legislation sponsored by a Green to be passed through a state legislature and signed into law in the United States. Redistricting and service in the House Following redistricting passed in 2003, Eder won re-election in 2004. In September 2005 during the break between legislative sessions Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Two weeks later Eder deployed with the Red Cross to drive a food canteen truck and provide case management to victims of the storm. 2006 elections Eder lost the 2006 election to the Maine House by about 60 votes to Democrat Jon Hinck. Eder entered the campaign as a favorite, and many environmental, gay-rights, labor, and progressive organizations lined up behind him. A controversy erupted when Eder paid for an automated phone call to voters with a recorded message from the head of the local chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) endorsing Eder and questioning Hinck's position on women's rights based on Hinck's answers to NOW's candidate questionnaire. Hinck declared himself pro-choice, but he did not commit to supporting a woman's right to an abortion in every circumstance. The phone calls didn't mention that they were paid for by Eder's campaign. Hinck claimed that the call violated state elections law by failing to disclose who paid for them. A new law passed earlier that year required that an automated robocall include a \\"tag\\" identifying who paid for them. The commission fined Eder $100.Eder call violation nets fine of $100 Hinck won the election with 51.5% of the vote to Eder's 48.5% Contributions Eder is considered a founding father of the Green Party in Portland. The Bollard Eder is further credited with changing Portland's political landscape by bringing young voters in Portland into the political process and paving the way for the Greens to assume their present role as the second party of contention in Portland, Maine's largest city. Several young activists who Eder mentored have since won political office in Portland. Former Eder campaign volunteers David A. Marshall and Kevin Donoghue took seats on the Portland City Council, becoming the first registered Greens to serve on that body. In 2010, his former Legislative Aide, Ben Chipman, won a seat in the Maine Legislature. Eder was the first member of a third-party to serve in the Maine Legislature since 1915 when representatives of Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party (United States) held legislative offices there. Eder remains the only state legislator in the country to serve a full term as a Green and to be re-elected as a Green. Post Legislature In November 2008 Eder was elected to the Cumberland County Charter Commission. Eder finished second out of five declared candidates running a write-in election for two seats. Eder travels the country speaking to regular citizens about to run and win local office as a way to demystify politics and feel empowered by taking personal responsibility for their own governance. Eder is a recipient of the George Mitchell Peace Scholarship. He studied at Southern Maine Community College.  2011 Portland mayoral election  Eder was a candidate for mayor in the 2011 Portland mayoral election. In the race Eder focused on providing living wages, affordable housing and health care for the city's working class residents. He was endorsed among the top three candidates for mayor by the League of Young Voters. Eder was also endorsed as the best choice for mayor by the Portland Phoenix on the issue of \\"social services.\\" The Phoenix said of Eder, \\"as a campaigner who has championed the city's working poor ‚Äî by advocating for living wage, affordable healthcare, and better housing options ‚Äî Eder has shown that he is passionate about helping the city's neediest citizens\\". Upon making its endorsements in the mayor's race, the Portland Daily Sun said, \\"John Eder‚Äôs ideas surrounding affordable housing and public transportation (especially when it comes to replacing school buses with METRO passes) were apparently good enough to be incorporated by several opponents.\\" Eder cross- endorsed fellow candidate, former legislative colleague and prominent Democrat Ethan Strimling, a first such cross-endorsement in the Portland mayoral race, which used instant-runoff voting for the first time in Maine. This led the Maine Green Independent Party, which had donated to Eder's campaign, to endorse the other Green in the race, City Councilor David Marshall. Portland Board of Education 2014-2017 Eder served a term on the Portland Board of Education during which time he chaired the committee to oversee the transition plan to have Greater Portland METRO buses transport Portland Public Schools‚Äô high school students to and from school. In addition, Eder advocated for the renovation of the districts elementary schools. Eder did not seek re- election. Failed bid for Democratic nomination and beyond In January 2018, Eder announced his bid for the Democratic nomination for District 12 of the Maine House of Representatives. He was subsequently defeated in the June primary by Victoria Foley. In February 2020, the Bangor Daily News published a letter to the editor by Eder in which he advocated the repeal of a law which eliminated most exemptions from state child vaccination requirements, including religious exemptions.

In December 1853, Babbitt died in Harvard, Massachusetts.Massachusetts, Death Records, 1841-1915  Career  =Toolmaker and inventor= Babbitt is credited with inventing the first circular saw for use in a saw mill in 1813. According to the Shakers, Babbitt was watching men use the difficult two-man whipsaw when she noticed that half of their motion was wasted. She proposed creating a round blade to increase efficiency. The circular saw was connected to a water-powered machine to reduce the effort to cut lumber.The History of Hardware ToolsChristian Becksvoort.

Gleanings from Old Shaker Journals. Houghton Mifflin; 1916. p. 275. In the summer of 1948, a version of Babbitt's saw, built to her specifications, was on display at a Shaker exhibit at Fenimore House in Cooperstown, N. Y., as a loan from the New York State Museum. Babbitt is also credited with inventing a process for the manufacture of false teeth and an improved spinning wheel head.Stanley, Autumn, Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Invention (Metuchen, NJ and London: Scarecrow Press, 1993), 259, 472, 500. She also allegedly invented cut nails, although the Shakers also credit the invention to the non-Shaker, Eli Whitney. As a Shaker, Babbitt never patented any of her inventions. Controversy over circular saw invention Because Babbitt did not patent her circular saw and the reference to her invention exists only in Shaker lore, there is controversy over whether she was the true first inventor of the saw. According to some accounts, two French men patented the circular saw in the United States after reading about Babbitt's saw in Shaker papers. M. Stephen Miller argues that Babbitt was not the first inventor of the circular saw, based upon the date that she joined the sect.

He was born at Barnstead, Coniscliffe Road, Darlington.Mark Girouard, 'Summerson, Sir John Newenham (1904‚Äì1992)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 accessed 2 May 2011 His grandfather worked for the Darlington and Stockton Railway and founded the family foundry of Thomas Summerson and Sons in Darlington in 1869. Summerson attended a prep school at Riber Castle in Derbyshire before going to Harrow and University College London, where he gained a bachelor's degree in 1928. He wrote mainly about British architecture, especially that of the Georgian era. His Architecture in Britain: 1530‚Äì1830 (1st edition 1953; many subsequent editions) remained a standard work on the subject for students and general readers after his death. The Classical Language of Architecture (1963) is an introduction to the stylistic elements of classical architecture and traces their use and variation in different eras. He also wrote many more specialised works, including books about Inigo Jones and Georgian London (1945) illustrated by Alison Sleigh, as well as The Architecture of the Eighteenth Century (1986), in which he describes Boull√©e in a distinct positive manner, stating that Boull√©e was clearly the point of departure for one of the boldest innovators of the century, Claude Nicolas Ledoux. Summerson was one of the founders of the National Buildings Record (NBR) in 1941 and was a Commissioner of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME) for twenty-one years, writing the introduction to the book celebrating the NBR's fiftieth anniversary in 1991.RCHME Newsletter 9. Spring 1993. ISSN 0957-0241150px He was curator of Sir John Soane's Museum from 1945 to 1984. He was Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford for 1958‚Äì59. The term Bristol Byzantine, referring to a style influenced by Byzantine and Moorish architecture and applied mainly to warehouses, factories, and other industrial buildings in the city of Bristol, is thought to have been invented by Summerson. He certainly invented the term prodigy house for showy Elizabethan and Jacobean courtier houses.Mooney, Barbara Burlison, Prodigy Houses of Virginia: Architecture and the Native Elite, p.2, 2008, University of Virginia Press, , 9780813926735, google books Summerson was noted for his somewhat elitist approach, and he was not always a consistent friend of the conservation movement. He was hired by the ESB in Ireland to speak in favour of their demolition of sixteen Georgian townhouses in Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin. The doomed terrace, he said, was \\"simply one damned house after another\\". An English Heritage blue plaque commemorating Summerson was erected at his former residence in Chalk Farm, London, in March 2012.

It is a close approximation to the wrapped normal distribution, which is the circular analogue of the normal distribution. A freely diffusing angle \\\\theta on a circle is a wrapped normally distributed random variable with an unwrapped variance that grows linearly in time. On the other hand, the von Mises distribution is the stationary distribution of a drift and diffusion process on the circle in a harmonic potential, i.e. with a preferred orientation. The von Mises distribution is the maximum entropy distribution for circular data when the real and imaginary parts of the first circular moment are specified. The von Mises distribution is a special case of the von Mises‚ÄìFisher distribution on the N-dimensional sphere.  Definition  The von Mises probability density function for the angle x is given by: :f(x\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)=\\\\frac{e^{\\\\kappa\\\\cos(x-\\\\mu)}}{2\\\\pi I_0(\\\\kappa)} where I0(\\\\kappa) is the modified Bessel function of order 0. The parameters Œº and 1/\\\\kappa are analogous to Œº and œÉ2 (the mean and variance) in the normal distribution: * Œº is a measure of location (the distribution is clustered around Œº), and * \\\\kappa is a measure of concentration (a reciprocal measure of dispersion, so 1/\\\\kappa is analogous to œÉ2).  If \\\\kappa is zero, the distribution is uniform, and for small \\\\kappa, it is close to uniform.  If \\\\kappa is large, the distribution becomes very concentrated about the angle Œº with \\\\kappa being a measure of the concentration. In fact, as \\\\kappa increases, the distribution approaches a normal distribution in x with mean Œº and variance 1/\\\\kappa. The probability density can be expressed as a series of Bessel functionssee Abramowitz and Stegun ¬ß9.6.34 : f(x\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{2}{I_0(\\\\kappa)} \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty I_j(\\\\kappa) \\\\cos[j(x-\\\\mu)]\\\\right) where Ij(x) is the modified Bessel function of order j. The cumulative distribution function is not analytic and is best found by integrating the above series. The indefinite integral of the probability density is: :\\\\Phi(x\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)=\\\\int f(t\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)\\\\,dt =\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{2}{I_0(\\\\kappa)} \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty I_j(\\\\kappa) \\\\frac{\\\\sin[j(x-\\\\mu)]}{j}\\\\right). The cumulative distribution function will be a function of the lower limit of integration x0: :F(x\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)=\\\\Phi(x\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)-\\\\Phi(x_0\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa).\\\\,  Moments  The moments of the von Mises distribution are usually calculated as the moments of the complex exponential z = eix rather than the angle x itself. These moments are referred to as circular moments. The variance calculated from these moments is referred to as the circular variance. The one exception to this is that the \\"mean\\" usually refers to the argument of the complex mean. The nth raw moment of z is: :m_n=\\\\langle z^n\\\\rangle=\\\\int_\\\\Gamma z^n\\\\,f(x\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)\\\\,dx := \\\\frac{I_{n}(\\\\kappa)}{I_0(\\\\kappa)}e^{i n \\\\mu} where the integral is over any interval \\\\Gamma of length 2œÄ. In calculating the above integral, we use the fact that zn = cos(nx) + i sin(nx) and the Bessel function identity:See Abramowitz and Stegun ¬ß9.6.19 :I_n(\\\\kappa)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^\\\\pi e^{\\\\kappa\\\\cos(x)}\\\\cos(nx)\\\\,dx. The mean of the complex exponential z is then just :m_1= \\\\frac{I_1(\\\\kappa)}{I_0(\\\\kappa)}e^{i\\\\mu} and the circular mean value of the angle x is then taken to be the argument Œº. This is the expected or preferred direction of the angular random variables. The variance of z, or the circular variance of x is: :\\\\textrm{var}(x)= 1-E[\\\\cos(x-\\\\mu)] = 1-\\\\frac{I_1(\\\\kappa)}{I_0(\\\\kappa)}.  Limiting behavior  When \\\\kappa is large, the distribution resembles a normal distribution. More specifically, for large positive real numbers \\\\kappa, : f(x\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa) \\\\approx \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\dfrac{-(x-\\\\mu)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right] where œÉ2 = 1/\\\\kappa and the difference between the left hand side and the right hand side of the approximation converges uniformly to zero as \\\\kappa goes to infinity. Also, when \\\\kappa is small, the probability density function resembles a uniform distribution: :\\\\lim_{\\\\kappa\\\\rightarrow 0}f(x\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)=\\\\mathrm{U}(x) where the interval for the uniform distribution \\\\mathrm{U}(x) is the chosen interval of length 2\\\\pi (i.e. \\\\mathrm{U}(x) = 1/(2\\\\pi) when x is in the interval and \\\\mathrm{U}(x)=0 when x is not in the interval).  Estimation of parameters  A series of N measurements z_n=e^{i\\\\theta_n} drawn from a von Mises distribution may be used to estimate certain parameters of the distribution. (Borradaile, 2003) The average of the series \\\\overline{z} is defined as :\\\\overline{z}=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N z_n and its expectation value will be just the first moment: :\\\\langle\\\\overline{z}\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{I_1(\\\\kappa)}{I_0(\\\\kappa)}e^{i\\\\mu}. In other words, \\\\overline{z} is an unbiased estimator of the first moment. If we assume that the mean \\\\mu lies in the interval [-\\\\pi,\\\\pi], then Arg(\\\\overline{z}) will be a (biased) estimator of the mean \\\\mu. Viewing the z_n as a set of vectors in the complex plane, the \\\\bar{R}^ 2 statistic is the square of the length of the averaged vector: :\\\\bar{R}^ 2=\\\\overline{z}\\\\,\\\\overline{z^*}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\cos\\\\theta_n\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\sin\\\\theta_n\\\\right)^2 and its expectation value is: :\\\\langle \\\\bar{R}^2\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{N}+\\\\frac{N-1}{N}\\\\,\\\\frac{I_1(\\\\kappa)^2}{I_0(\\\\kappa)^2}. In other words, the statistic :R_e^2=\\\\frac{N}{N-1}\\\\left(\\\\bar{R}^2-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\right) will be an unbiased estimator of \\\\frac{I_1(\\\\kappa)^2}{I_0(\\\\kappa)^2}\\\\, and solving the equation R_e=\\\\frac{I_1(\\\\kappa)}{I_0(\\\\kappa)}\\\\, for \\\\kappa\\\\, will yield a (biased) estimator of \\\\kappa\\\\,. In analogy to the linear case, the solution to the equation \\\\bar{R}=\\\\frac{I_1(\\\\kappa)}{I_0(\\\\kappa)}\\\\, will yield the maximum likelihood estimate of \\\\kappa\\\\, and both will be equal in the limit of large N. For approximate solution to \\\\kappa\\\\, refer to von Mises‚ÄìFisher distribution.  Distribution of the mean  The distribution of the sample mean \\\\overline{z} = \\\\bar{R}e^{i\\\\overline{\\\\theta}} for the von Mises distribution is given by: : P(\\\\bar{R},\\\\bar{\\\\theta})\\\\,d\\\\bar{R}\\\\,d\\\\bar{\\\\theta}=\\\\frac{1}{ (2\\\\pi I_0(\\\\kappa))^N}\\\\int_\\\\Gamma \\\\prod_{n=1}^N \\\\left( e^{\\\\kappa\\\\cos(\\\\theta_n-\\\\mu)} d\\\\theta_n\\\\right) = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\kappa N\\\\bar{R}\\\\cos(\\\\bar{\\\\theta}-\\\\mu)}}{I_0(\\\\kappa)^N}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^N}\\\\int_\\\\Gamma \\\\prod_{n=1}^N d\\\\theta_n\\\\right) where N is the number of measurements and \\\\Gamma\\\\, consists of intervals of 2\\\\pi in the variables, subject to the constraint that \\\\bar{R} and \\\\bar{\\\\theta} are constant, where \\\\bar{R} is the mean resultant: : \\\\bar{R}^2=\\\\bar{z}^2= \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\cos(\\\\theta_n) \\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\sin(\\\\theta_n) \\\\right)^2 and \\\\overline{\\\\theta} is the mean angle: : \\\\overline{\\\\theta}=\\\\mathrm{Arg}(\\\\overline{z}). \\\\, Note that product term in parentheses is just the distribution of the mean for a circular uniform distribution. This means that the distribution of the mean direction \\\\mu of a von Mises distribution VM(\\\\mu, \\\\kappa) is a von Mises distribution VM(\\\\mu, \\\\bar{R}N\\\\kappa), or, equivalently, VM(\\\\mu, R\\\\kappa).  Entropy  By definition, the information entropy of the von Mises distribution is :H = -\\\\int_\\\\Gamma f(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)\\\\,\\\\ln(f(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\kappa))\\\\,d\\\\theta\\\\, where \\\\Gamma is any interval of length 2\\\\pi. The logarithm of the density of the Von Mises distribution is straightforward: :\\\\ln(f(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\kappa))=-\\\\ln(2\\\\pi I_0(\\\\kappa))+ \\\\kappa \\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\, The characteristic function representation for the Von Mises distribution is: :f(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\kappa) =\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(1+2\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\phi_n\\\\cos(n\\\\theta)\\\\right) where \\\\phi_n= I_{n}(\\\\kappa)/I_0(\\\\kappa). Substituting these expressions into the entropy integral, exchanging the order of integration and summation, and using the orthogonality of the cosines, the entropy may be written: :H = \\\\ln(2\\\\pi I_0(\\\\kappa))-\\\\kappa\\\\phi_1 = \\\\ln(2\\\\pi I_0(\\\\kappa))-\\\\kappa\\\\frac{I_1(\\\\kappa)}{I_0(\\\\kappa)} For \\\\kappa=0, the von Mises distribution becomes the circular uniform distribution and the entropy attains its maximum value of \\\\ln(2\\\\pi). Notice that the Von Mises distribution maximizes the entropy when the real and imaginary parts of the first circular moment are specified or, equivalently, the circular mean and circular variance are specified.

Other types of fossil water can include subglacial lakes, such as Antarctica's Lake Vostok, and even ancient water on other planets. UNESCO defines fossil groundwater as Determining the time since water infiltrated usually involves analyzing isotopic signatures. Determining \\"fossil\\" status‚Äîwhether or not that particular water has occupied that particular space since the distant past‚Äîinvolves modeling the flow, recharge, and losses of aquifers, which can involve significant uncertainty. Some aquifers are hundreds of meters deep and underlie vast areas of land. Research techniques in the field are developing quickly and the scientific knowledge base is growing. In the cases of many aquifers, research is lacking or disputed as to the age of the water and the behavior of the water inside the aquifer.  Renewability  Large, prolific aquifers (notably the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System and the Ogallala Aquifer) containing fossil water are of significant socio-economic value. Fossil water is extracted from these aquifers for many human purposes, notably, agriculture, industry, and consumption. In arid regions, some aquifers containing available and usable water receive little to no significant recharge, effectively making groundwater in those aquifers a non- renewable resource. Extraction rates greater than recharge rates result in lowering of the water table and can lead to groundwater depletion. Extraction of non-renewable groundwater resources is referred to as groundwater \\"mining\\" because of their finite nature.  General geology  Aquifers are typically composed of semi-porous rock or unconsolidated material whose pore space has been filled with water. In the relatively rare cases of confined aquifers, an impermeable geologic layer (e.g. clay or calcrete) encloses an aquifer, isolating the water within, sometimes for millennia. More commonly, fossil water is found in arid or semi-arid regions where the climate was significantly more humid in recent geologic history. In some semi-arid regions, the majority of precipitation evaporates before it can infiltrate and result in any significant aquifer recharge. Most fossil groundwater has been estimated to have originally infiltrated within the Holocene and Pleistocene (10,000‚Äì40,000 years ago). Some fossil groundwater is associated with the melting of ice in the time since the last glacial maximum. Dating of groundwater relies on measuring concentrations of certain stable isotopes, including (tritium) and (\\"heavy\\" oxygen), and comparing values with known concentrations of the geologic past. Fossil water can potentially dissolve and absorb a number of ions from its host rock. Salinity in groundwater can be higher than seawater.\\"Groundwater Information Sheet: Salinity\\". CA State Water Resources Control Board. http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/docs/coc_salinity.pdf In some cases, some form of treatment is required to make these waters suitable for human use. Saline fossil aquifers can also store significant quantities of oil and natural gas.  Notable bodies of fossil water  = Ogallala Aquifer = The Ogallala or High Plains Aquifer sits under 450,000 km2 of 8 states of the United States of America. It is one of the largest freshwater deposits in the world. The aquifer is composed of unconsolidated alluvial deposits. Groundwater in this aquifer has been dated to have been deposited in the humid time following the last glacial maximum. In much of the aquifer's area, an impermeable layer of calcrete prevents precipitation from infiltrating. In other regions of the aquifer, some relatively small rates of recharge have been measured. The aquifer supplies water for the many people who live above it and for widespread agricultural uses. In many areas, the water table has dropped drastically due to heavy extraction. Depletion rates are not stabilizing; in fact, they have been increasing in recent decades.Transport of pipe segments for the Great Manmade River in Libya: a network of pipes that supplies water from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System. = Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System = The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is located in northeastern Africa, under the nations of Sudan, Libya, Egypt, and Chad, covering about 2,000,000 km2. It is largely composed of many hydraulically interconnected sandstone aquifers. Some parts of the system are considered to be confined, if somewhat leaky, due to impermeable layers such as marine shales. The water was deposited between 4,000 and 20,000 years ago, varying by specific locality. The water in the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is of high importance to the people living above it, and has been for millennia. In modern times, as demand increases, avoiding rapid depletion and international conflict will depend on careful cross-boundary monitoring and planning. Libya and Egypt are currently planning development projects to withdraw significant amounts of the aquifer's fossil water for use. Other fossil aquifers have been identified throughout Northern Africa as well. = Kalahari Desert aquifers = The Kalahari Desert is in central southern Africa (Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa). Geology of the area includes significant karst formations. Most of the precipitation in the region evaporates before it can contribute to significant recharge of the aquifers below. Whether or not the region's aquifers receive any significant recharge has long been the subject of debate and research. In the northern region of the Kalahari, a deep aquifer in Cave sandstone was found to have isotopic signatures that suggested it had been confined with little to no leakage for long periods of time.

She first appeared as a supporting antagonist in McFarlane's creator-owned series Spawn, making her debut in issue #9 in March 1993, and later starring in her own self-titled miniseries. She is an angel and a bounty hunter, working under the auspices of Heaven to oppose Spawn. Angela was later the subject of a legal battle between McFarlane and Gaiman over the rights to the character, which Gaiman won. Gaiman later sold the rights to the character to Marvel Comics; she was integrated into the Marvel Universe in the 2013 story \\"Age of Ultron\\", and her character was expanded upon in the 2014 storyline \\"Original Sin\\", where she was established to be the lost sister of Thor. Publication history =Image Comics= In 1993 Todd McFarlane contracted Neil Gaiman, along with three other recognized authors, Alan Moore, Dave Sim, and Frank Miller, to write one issue of his creator-owned comics series Spawn, which was published by Image Comics. While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, Cogliostro, and Medieval Spawn. All three characters were co-created and designed by McFarlane. Angela first appeared in issue #9, as an adversary. In 1994 and 1995, a three-issue Angela limited series was published, written by Gaiman and illustrated by Greg Capullo, in which Angela and Spawn were forced by circumstance to temporarily work together as allies. The series was later reprinted as a trade paperback titled Angela Trade Paperback, retitled as Spawn: Angela's Hunt in later printings and given a new cover design (). The monthly Spawn series continued to feature all of the characters Gaiman had created long after his direct involvement had ended. Some characters had tie-ins with McFarlane's toy company, and Cogliostro had a prominent role in the live-action movie in 1997. Angela would appear in Spawn #62, #89, and #96 through #100, and in a 1995, a one-shot. She was also featured featured in several crossovers. The Rage of Angels miniseries saw Angela meeting Glory in Angela and Glory (1996), and was continued in Youngblood #6 (1996) and Team Youngblood #21. There was also a crossover called Aria/Angela, in which she featured in the series Aria. McFarlane had initially agreed that Gaiman retained creator rights to the characters, but later claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's co-creations entirely, pointing to the legal indicia of Spawn #9 and the lack of legal contract stating otherwise. McFarlane had also refused to pay Gaiman for the volumes of Gaiman's work that McFarlane republished and kept in print. In 2002, Gaiman filed suit and won a sizable judgment against McFarlane and Image Comics for the rights due any creator. All three characters were then equally co-owned by both men. In 2012, McFarlane and Gaiman settled their dispute, and Gaiman was given full ownership of Angela. =Marvel Comics= Comic Book Resources confirmed on March 21, 2013 that Neil Gaiman was returning to Marvel Comics and would bring Angela with him. Joe Quesada was quoted as saying her first appearance as a proper Marvel character would happen at the finale of the \\"Age of Ultron\\" storyline. BleedingCool later confirmed that Marvel Comics had completely bought the rights to Angela from Gaiman.

A long time ago, the Angel tasked to dispose of Aldrif's body found out the baby was alive and raised her as one of the Angels under the name of Angela. In light of this revelation, the Queen of Angels grants Angela her life, pardoning her for her service to the Angels, but exiles her from Heven due to her lineage.

The cast stars Alison Lohman in the central role of Astrid Magnussen and Michelle Pfeiffer as her borderline personality disordered, murderous, manipulative mother, Ingrid, with Robin Wright, Noah Wyle and Ren√©e Zellweger in supporting roles. The screenplay was adapted from Janet Fitch's 1999 novel White Oleander, which was selected for Oprah's Book Club in May 1999. Plot Fifteen-year-old Astrid Magnussen (Alison Lohman) is living in Los Angeles with her mother, the free-spirited artist Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer). Since her father left before she was old enough to remember him, Astrid depends heavily upon the care of her passionate but largely self-centered mother. Ingrid's current relationship with a writer named Barry (Billy Connolly) ends when she discovers he is cheating on her with younger women. Ingrid murders him with a poison made from white oleander. Ingrid is arrested and sentenced to life in prison, leaving Astrid under the care of the state of California. Astrid is sent to live with foster mother Starr Thomas (Robin Wright), a former stripper who is a recovering alcoholic and born-again Christian. They initially interact well, with Astrid being baptised into Starr's church. Ingrid is appalled at Astrid's religious conversion and manipulates Astrid against her foster family. Astrid begins an affair with Starr's live-in boyfriend Ray (Cole Hauser), which drives Starr to relapsing. After a loud argument with Ray, she runs into Astrid's room in a drunken rage and shoots her in the shoulder. Starr and Ray both flee the scene; the other children beg Astrid not to tell who shot her, so Astrid pretends she has no clue. Astrid spends some time recovering in a hospital before being moved to McKinney Children's Center (known as \\"Mac\\"). After fighting with some girls, she strikes up a friendship with fellow artist Paul Trout (Patrick Fugit). Eventually, Astrid is placed in the care of Claire Richards (Ren√©e Zellweger), a former actress, and her producer husband Mark (Noah Wyle). Claire is a fragile but affectionate woman who forms a close bond with Astrid, who finally begins to thrive as a result. One day, Astrid comes home to find a letter from Ingrid to Claire. Claire admits the correspondence has been going on for a while and that Ingrid insists on meeting. During their prison visitation meeting, a jealous Ingrid exploits Claire's low self-esteem and suspicions over Mark's fidelity, much to Astrid's outrage. Claire's depression worsens; during a bad fight with Mark, she agrees to send Astrid back to try and save her marriage. Astrid begs Claire not to send her away. Claire seems to recant, then unexpectedly commits suicide later that night, devastating Astrid. Astrid visits Ingrid in prison to inform her of Claire's death, and that she was returned to Mac. Blaming Ingrid for Claire's suicide, Astrid announces she will never visit her again. In Mac, Paul tells Astrid that when he turns 18 soon he will move to New York. He asks Astrid to accompany him but she coldly refuses. Astrid passes up better foster parent candidates and chooses to live with a Russian immigrant, Rena Gruschenko (Svetlana Efremova), who treats her foster children as cheap laborers for her swap meet business. During her time with Rena, she becomes colder and colder, with her outward appearance matching her inside demeanor. She is approached by her mother's attorney Susan Vallares (Kali Rocha), a woman taken in by her mother's charm. Susan offers Astrid anything she wants in exchange for lying for her mother in court, since her mother has benefactors. Astrid refuses; Rena tells her that she's stupid to turn down money. Rena then offers to make Astrid an equal partner in their business, since Astrid has nowhere better to go. When Astrid balks at the idea, Rena encourages her to use her mother like her mother wants to use her. Astrid visits Ingrid one final time in prison, astonishing her with her appearance. She is no longer blond, but has black hair, harsh makeup, and dark clothes. Realizing she has control over her mother for once in her life, Astrid demands answers about her past in exchange for testifying that Barry committed suicide. Astrid hammers her with questions about Barry, her father, Claire, and a mysterious woman named Annie whom Astrid vaguely recalls from her toddler years. Ingrid admits that Annie was a neighbor with whom she left Astrid for over a year in order to continue living her self-obsessed lifestyle. Ingrid further admits that Astrid's father came looking for her when she was 8, but Ingrid turned him away for leaving them 7 years before. Astrid is devastated by these revelations. Ingrid claims she would take all she has done back, but when Astrid begs her to not make her testify, she refuses. Astrid goes to a comic book shop looking for letters from Paul. He soon shows up by bus in Los Angeles and the two renew their relationship. He accompanies her to her mother's trial as she waits to testify. The courtroom lets out and a curious Astrid goes to see what is going on. She questions Susan, and finds out that Susan was instructed by Ingrid to leave Astrid alone during the trial. Ingrid spots Astrid in the courtroom and they stare at one another as she is led away. Gutted, Astrid stares out the window as her mother is taken back to the bus to return to prison. Paul asks what happened, and she exhales that her mother finally let her go. Two years later, a once-again- blond Astrid has created a life in New York City with Paul. She is seen tending to her art; dioramas in suitcases depicting all she has been through. As she passes them, she closes each, stating she will never visit the horrors they contain again. Pausing at the final suitcase depicting Ingrid, Astrid reflects in voiceover that no matter how flawed Ingrid is, she knows her mother loves her.

Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, and she first appeared in Archie's Mad House #22 in October 1962. Creation Sabrina the Teenage Witch debuted in Archie's Madhouse (the logo sometimes given as Archie's Mad House) #22 (Oct. 1962). Created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, she first appeared in that humor anthology's lead story (the logo then spelled \\"Teen-Age\\"),Archive of McQuarrie, Jim, \\"Archie's Mad House No. 22\\", \\"Oddball Comics\\" (column) #1153, April 1, 2007. Original page and eventually became one of Archie Comics' major characters, appearing in an animated series and a television sitcom. Gladir recalled in 2007: Biography Originally, Sabrina was created by her two aunts, Hilda and Zelda Spellman, from a magic potion that turned out wrong. However, it was later retconned by the 1996 Sabrina sitcom that Sabrina is a \\"half-witch\\" (her mother is an ordinary human, or \\"mortal\\" as witches refer to them, while her father is a warlock). She lives with Hilda and Zelda (both witches themselves) in the fictional town of Greendale, which is located somewhere near Riverdale, the home of Archie Andrews, while her father is away. The 1996 live action series also gave Sabrina and her aunts the last name ‚ÄúSpellman‚Äù. Also living with the three women as the family pet is Salem Saberhagen. In the original comic stories Salem was a typical witch's cat who did not talk. The 1996 sitcom introduced the idea that Salem was a witch who has been turned into a cat as punishment for world domination attempts. Most of Sabrina's adventures consist of Sabrina either trying to use her powers in secret to help others - witches generally are not allowed to tell mortals about their abilities or existence - or dealing with the day-to-day trials of being a teenager. A recurring theme in Sabrina's stories is her learning more about the proper use of her powers, either through her aunts or from trips to a magical dimension that is the home of various magical/mythological creatures, including other witches. Various names are given to this dimension; the mid-late 2000s comics refer to it as the \\"Magic Realm,\\"Sabrina the Teenage Witch (volume 3) #58-100, 2004-2009 while the live-action sitcom referred to it as the \\"Other Realm.\\" These adventures even contained moments where Sabrina had to act as superhero on occasion.Archie Giant Series Magazine #544 October 1984The Encyclopedia of Super Heroes 1985 Page 249. . Publisher: Facts on File. Sabrina's primary romantic love interest is her mortal boyfriend named Harvey Kinkle who, like nearly all the other mortals in Sabrina's world, is unaware his girlfriend is a witch. Other versions =Afterlife with Archie= Sabrina Spellman appears in the first issue of Afterlife with Archie where she resurrects Hot Dog for Jughead. This starts the zombie apocalypse in Riverdale. She later appears in issue 6 where she is forced to become the bride of Cthulhu. =Archie vs. Predator= In the crossover Archie vs. Predator, Betty and Veronica go to Sabrina's house to ask for aid when Pop's murder by the Predator is connected to a knife Betty found on their Spring Break vacation. When Sabrina tries performing the spell, the Predator leaps into her house and murders her and Salem. When the police come to check the murder, the house disappears and the police are turned into goats. =Chilling Adventures of Sabrina= Sabrina Spellman is the main character in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina set in the city of Greendale near Riverdale. In other media =Animation= Filmation productions Sabrina first appeared in a 1969 segment from Filmation's The Archie Comedy Hour. She later appeared in her own Filmation half-hour series in 1971. Here she is created by Hilda and Zelda Spellman out of magic potions, as well as the accidental addition of items stereotypically associated with teenage girls, such as makeup and dresses. DIC Entertainment productions A 12-year-old version of Sabrina appeared in Sabrina: The Animated Series (1999‚Äì2000), produced by DIC Entertainment. The animated series was advertised as a spin-off of the live- action series and borrowed certain elements from it, but it was set in an alternate continuity closer to that of the comics, as it contradicted the live-action show's premise of Sabrina not knowing about magic prior to her sixteenth birthday. This was followed by Sabrina: Friends Forever (2002) and Sabrina's Secret Life (2003‚Äì2004), also produced by DIC. In Sabrina: The Animated Series (1999-2000), Emily Hart (Melissa Joan Hart's younger sister) voices the character; Britt McKillip voices Sabrina in Sabrina: Friends Forever and Sabrina's Secret Life. Hub Network production In 2012, Sabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch premiered also centering on a younger Sabrina. Ashley Tisdale provided the voice acting for the character. =Live action= Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996‚Äì2003) In 1996, a live-action TV film called Sabrina the Teenage Witch premiered on Showtime, starring Melissa Joan Hart. This movie led to the live-action television series later that same year on ABC which ran for seven seasons until 2003. Sabrina Spellman, portrayed in live-action by Melissa Joan Hart, using her magic finger to fill the cup with milk On her sixteenth birthday, Sabrina learns that she is a half-witch (through her father's side) and has magical powers. She also learns that her two aunts are witches themselves and that their black cat Salem is a witch who has been turned into a talking household pet as punishment for attempting worldwide domination. At Westbridge High, she befriends Jenny Kelly (and later Valerie Birkhead) and has an on-again, off- again relationship with Harvey Kinkle. She also has to deal with the snobby and headstrong cheerleader, Libby Chessler, who becomes Sabrina's rival for school activities as well as Harvey's affections. In later seasons, Sabrina is enrolled at the fictional Adams College in Boston. After getting her degree in journalism she moves back to her aunts' house with Morgan and Roxie. She took a job with the fictitious Scorch Magazine, a music-themed magazine for which she interviews famous artists. Later on, she meets a man named Aaron, who also worked in the music industry, and the two begin dating. Before long, Aaron proposes, and in the finale, the two are set to wed when unforeseen events took place. Sabrina starts to suspect that Aaron was not the one for her, and after trying to connect her soul stone with his, she becomes sure of it. While the stones mostly fit, it is not a perfect fit. She tries to ignore this but finally follows her heart and cancels the marriage at the altar. When she runs out of the church, she finds Harvey waiting for her outside on his motorcycle, holding his soulstone that Amanda, her cousin, had left him. Harvey and Sabrina toss their soul stones aside and ride off together in true finale fashion, not even noticing that the stones fit together perfectly. For most of the series, Sabrina would regularly cast spells that landed her in trouble, requiring her to turn to her aunts for help. In season 5, after moving out of her aunts' house, Sabrina starts thinking of herself as independent, and whenever something goes wrong, she tries to solve the problem on her own. However, she cannot help but get herself into situations beyond her control (as in the episode Heart of the Matter, when she uses a dating spell to attract boys, but the spell goes wrong when Sabrina's head and heart becoming conflicted. She is then forced to go to Zelda for help). During her time at Adams College, as revealed in the episode \\"The Whole Ball of Wax,\\" Sabrina is finally able to meet her mother. However, it is revealed that the Witches' Council had set a decree that if the two were ever to meet face to face, her mother would turn into a ball of wax. While the decree was never repealed, Sabrina accidentally frees her mother by crying into the ball of wax. However, they could not ever see each other face to face again, the one exception being the series finale, in which Hilda volunteered Zelda to be turned into wax until the wedding ended. In the TV movie Sabrina Goes to Rome, Sabrina, accompanied by Salem, travels to Rome, Italy in order to discover the secret of a mysterious antique locket and save her Aunt Sophia. While there, she befriends Gwen, an inexperienced British witch, who helps her to solve the mystery of the locket. The sequel, Sabrina Down Under, depicts Sabrina and Gwen going on vacation in Australia's Great Barrier Reef and end up trying to save a hidden colony of merpeople from water pollution and a scheming marine biologist. Throughout the series, it is shown that Sabrina has many love interests and boyfriends she has romantic crushes on. Her most prominent one is her first boyfriend, Harvey Dwight Kinkle. In Seasons 1-4 she meets and dates Harvey Kinkle, who becomes her first true love which is proven when Harvey is turned into a frog by her kiss, she takes the test of true love and passes it, proving she truly loves him. Though in the early seasons, they break up but usually make up in the end. However, in an episode of Boy Meets World titled \\"The Witches of Penbrook\\", she is seen at the end of the episode on a date with Eric Matthews. When she was dating Dashiell, another magic- powered character, she had to choose between both Dashiell and Harvey and eventually chooses Harvey. In season 4, she is romantically attracted to Josh who is her manager at the coffee house where she works. She kisses him and Harvey witnesses it causing them to break up though they get back together in \\"Love Means Having to Say You're Sorry\\". They officially end their romantic relationship in \\"The End Of an Era\\" but Harvey still appears in the show as a recurring character. In season 6, she starts dating Josh who at first dated Morgan, her roommate. Meanwhile, in the season 6 finale, Sabrina gives up her one true love to save her Aunt Hilda and it happens when during her aunt's wedding she falls to pieces when Harvey tells her he still has strong romantic feelings for her but she does not return them, making him leave for California. Josh says he is taking the photography job he was offered in Prague, and a cute waiter named Luke says goodbye but she is saved when her Aunt Zelda gives up her adult years to save her. In the seventh season, she meets and starts dating Aaron whom she met at the Scorch magazine office. They become engaged but Sabrina's aunt Irma turns him into a goldfish but Aaron is turned back when Harvey (who is in love with Sabrina) uses Sabrina's magic because he wants to make Sabrina happy. In the series finale, Sabrina prepares for her wedding but stops it when she realizes Aaron is not her soulmate and she runs off with Harvey, her soulmate and first true love (they are soulmates because when their soul stones drop to the ground they fit perfectly) at 12:36, the time they first met seven years ago. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Kiernan Shipka plays Sabrina on Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. In September 2017, it was announced that Sabrina would return to television in the form of a new live action series that would act as a spin-off to The CW's Riverdale.

The story is set in ancient Troy, and is based on the Iliad by Homer. This serial sees the last appearance of Maureen O'Brien as Vicki and the introduction of Adrienne Hill as the Doctor's newest companion, Katarina. Although audio recordings, production stills and 8mm clips of the story exist, no episodes of this serial are known to have survived. Plot The Greek army has besieged the walled city of Troy for ten years. The TARDIS materialises outside the city, distracting the Trojan Hector, son of King Priam. The Greek warrior Achilles takes advantage and kills him. When the First Doctor emerges, Achilles believes him to be the God Zeus, in disguise, and brings him to the Greek encampment along with the warrior Odysseus. At the camp, the Greek leader Agamemnon insists the Doctor help them fight the Trojans, although Odysseus believes he is a Trojan spy. Meanwhile, the Doctor's companions Vicki and Steven remain in the TARDIS. Vicki has an injured ankle from a previous adventure, so Steven goes alone to try to find the Doctor. Odysseus catches Steven and takes him to the Greek camp. Pretending to be Zeus, the Doctor persuades the Greeks to spare Steven until the next morning. They learn that the TARDIS has disappeared. The TARDIS has been taken into Troy by another of King Priam's sons, Paris, and presented as a prize to his father. Priam's daughter, the prophet Cassandra, denounces the TARDIS as dangerous ‚Äì she has dreamt that the Greeks will leave a gift on the plain which will contain soldiers to attack the Trojans. She demands that the TARDIS be burnt. A pyre is constructed, but before the fire is lit, Vicki emerges from the TARDIS, which is taken as a sign from the gods. She is renamed Cressida and made a favourite at court. This enrages Cassandra, who believes Vicki to be a rival prophet, although her handmaiden Katarina defends Vicki. Priam sends Paris out to avenge his brother Hector. Paris calls for his rival Achilles to present himself, but Steven persuades the Greeks to send him in Greek armour instead, hoping to be taken prisoner so he can search for Vicki. Adopting the identity Diomedes, Steven engages Paris in battle and his ruse works. When he arrives, however, Vicki greets him with his real name, which Cassandra sees as a sign they are both spies. Steven and Vicki are taken to cells. Priam's youngest son Troilus visits Vicki. She persuades him to try to get them released, and it is clear the two are falling in love. The Doctor proposes to Odysseus a great ruse: the Greeks will pretend to sail away, leaving a wooden horse behind outside Troy, as a tribute and acknowledgement of defeat, hoping the Trojans will take it inside the city without realising it is actually hollow and filled with Greek soldiers. Agamemnon approves, but only provided the Doctor is among those inside the horse. The horse is spotted by the Trojans, who rejoice at the Greek army's apparent retreat. Priam has Vicki released. Paris brings the horse into the city. Vicki frees Steven, who urges her to convince Troilus to leave Troy. She tells Troilus that Diomedes has escaped. Troilus leaves Troy to search for him, but encounters Achilles, whom he kills to avenge Hector. At nightfall, the Greeks and the Doctor leave the horse and open the city gates. The Greek army enters and so begins the downfall of Troy. As the fighting rages, the Doctor evades Odysseus and finds Vicki. Priam and Paris are slain, and Cassandra taken prisoner. Katarina finds Steven badly wounded and helps him return to the TARDIS. Vicki leaves the Doctor, anxious to find Troilus; outside the doomed city, they declare their love for each other and flee. Odysseus threatens the Doctor, who is able to dematerialise the TARDIS with Steven and Katarina on board. Katarina believes she has died and the Doctor is taking her on the journey after death. Steven is delirious because of his wound, and the Doctor feels he must land somewhere to attend to Steven's injuries. Production Episode is missing This was the first story produced by new series producer John Wiles, replacing the original producer, Verity Lambert, in the role. Originally, the titles of all the episodes were intended by Dennis Spooner to be puns (as was that of Episode 2), including: \\"Zeus Ex Machina\\" and \\"Is There A Doctor In The Horse?\\". These titles were vetoed by the BBC, but the title of Episode 2 was allowed to remain only at script editor Donald Tosh's insistence. A number of chapters in the novelisation have titles based around these puns. Donald Cotton pulled material for his scripts from his extensive knowledge of classical and medieval literature, including the epics of Homer, the plays of Aeschylus and Euripides, Virgil's Aeneid, and Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. William Hartnell suffered a bereavement while working on the story: the death of his Aunt Bessie, who had looked after him during his troubled childhood. Unfortunately, the tight recording schedules prevented Hartnell from taking time off to attend her funeral. This led to him becoming difficult during production, refusing to speak to actors Max Adrian or Francis de Wolff and declaring director Michael Leeston-Smith a \\"fool\\". All four episodes are missing from the BBC Archives, and no tele-snaps are known to exist. =Cast notes= Barrie Ingham also played Alydon in the film Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965). Francis de Wolff had previously played Vasor in The Keys of Marinus (1964). Tutte Lemkow had previously played Kuiju in Marco Polo (1964) and Ibrahim in The Crusade (1965). Ivor Salter had previously played the Morok Commander in The Space Museum (1965) and would appear again as Sergeant Markham in Black Orchid (1982). Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Donald Cotton, was published by Target Books in April 1985. There are significant differences between the novel and the televised story; the novel is narrated by Homer, who also plays the part of the mute servant Cyclops from the episode. The cliffhanger ending of Steven being wounded is also gone. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Stephen Thorne was released on CD in April 2008 by BBC Audiobooks. =Home media= The soundtracks to these episodes exist and have been released on CD with linking narration provided by Peter Purves. The only extant clips ‚Äì eleven short 8mm film recordings made by fans off-air ‚Äì were made available on the Lost in Time DVD boxset release.

It was designed by French architect Jean Nouvel in association with the Spanish firm b720 Ferm√≠n V√°zquez Arquitectos and built by Dragados. The Torre Gl√≤ries is located in the Poblenou neighbourhood of Barcelona and it was originally named after its owners, the Agbar Group, a holding company whose interests include the Barcelona water company Aig√ºes de Barcelona.Agbar corporate Web site The tower measures a total of , of which are offices, technical facilities, services, including an auditorium, and parking space. It cost ‚Ç¨130 million to build. It opened in June 2005 and was officially opened by King Juan Carlos I on 16 September 2005. It is one in a collection of high-tech architecture examples in Barcelona. The building was owned by the multinational group Agbar, which has its corporate headquarters in the building and which takes up most of the floors, leasing the remainder. The Agbar Tower was acquired in March 2010 for 165 million euros, after reaching an agreement with its former owner, the investment group Azurelau.Azurelau sells Barcelona's Agbar tower for EUR 165m Azurelau had previously bought the property in mid-2007. The purchase price was not disclosed. By 2017 it was purchased by Merlin Properties real estate group and it was renamed as Torre Gl√≤ries after the name of the adjacent square. Design According to Jean Nouvel, Torre Agbar is intended to recall the shape of a geyser rising into the air. It was inspired by Montserrat, a mountain near Barcelona. In an interview, he described the tower as having a phallic character.El gran supositorio Article by El Pais, quote: The suppository of Agbar rises to the heavens quickly (Translation by Google) As a result of its unusual shape, the building is known by several nicknames, such as el supositori (\\"the suppository\\"), l'ob√∫s (\\"the shell\\") and some more scatological ones.Not√≠cias Agbar (Includes interview with Jean Nouvel) quote from the Jean Nouvel interview: The Torre Agbar is called the suppository.

The Agbar Tower measures in heightTorre agbar homepage and consists of 38 storeys, including four underground levels. Its design combines a number of different architectural concepts, resulting in a striking structure built with reinforced concrete, covered with a facade of glass, and over 4,500 window openings cut out of the structural concrete. The building stands out in Barcelona; it is the third tallest building in the city, after the Arts Hotel and the Mapfre Tower, which both stand tall. A defining feature of the building is its nocturnal illumination. It has 4,500 LED devices that allow generation of luminous images on its fa√ßade. In addition, the outside of the tower has temperature sensors that regulate the opening and closing of the window blinds of the fa√ßade, reducing the consumption of energy for air conditioning. It houses the head office of the Aig√ºes de Barcelona Group, the water supply company of Barcelona. As explained by Nouvel himself, the construction was strongly influenced by one of the most representative symbols of Catalan culture. One side references the bell towers of the Sagrada Familia by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud√≠. (These bell towers were based in turn on the idea of the Hotel Attraction, a course project by the teacher Reus in 1908 for some New York hoteliers, which was redesigned in 1956 by his disciple Joan Matamala. These designs were included in Rem Koolhaas' book Delirious New York, a reference for many architects.) An additional tribute to the Sagrada Fam√≠lia lies in the north side of the tower, which was designed with the intention of obtaining an optimal view of the cathedral. Additionally, Nouvel was inspired by the distinctive pinnacles of the Montserrat mountain range, which are of great significance for the people of Catalonia, as Montserrat houses their patron saint, Our Lady of Montserrat. In designing the Agbar Tower, Nouvel said he rejected the prevailing North American opinion of what a skyscraper should look like. It was the architect's intention to give the impression of land that is emerging out of the ground in a particular fashion. The use of the tower by a water utility company led him to the design of a metaphor of a geyser sprouting from the deep sea. = Construction = Starting in mid-1999, when activities were initiated for preparing the site, Dragados's,Structurae database construction project dragged on for nearly six years, finally ending in late 2004. Approximately 1170 workers were engaged in its construction.  Features  = Materials = The main materials used in the construction of the building are concrete which comprises the structure of the tower and aluminium and glass in the form of 59,619 strips of painted sheet metal of different colours, covering the approximately 16,000 m2 of exterior surface. In addition, the glass has different inclinations and opacities which, combined with the different shades of aluminium, alter the colour balance of the tower as a function of time of day and season of the year. The construction used 25,000 m3 of concrete and 125 tonnes of steel. = Form and structure = The tower is made up of two concentric concrete oval cylinders which do not come in contact with each other. The outer cylinder, which completely encases the inner cylinder is covered by a dome of glass and steel which gives the tower its characteristic shape of a bullet. This outer cylinder with a thickness of 45 cm at the base and 25 cm at the top contains approximately 4,500 windows, while the inner cylinder measuring 50 cm at the base and 30 cm at the highest point, is where the lifts, stairs and facilities are located. = Distribution = The building contains 38 floors of which 34 are above ground and four floors are underground. Two of the underground floors host an auditorium for 316 people in addition to other services areas while the other two are intended for parking. Of the 34 floors located above the ground, 28 are for offices, three are technical plants hosting building facilities, one is dedicated to multipurpose rooms, another houses the cafeteria and the last is intended to be a viewing platform just below the top of the tower.  Lighting  One of the most characteristic elements of the building is its nocturnal illumination. The tower has more than 4,500 luminous devices that can operate independently using LED technology and enables the generation of images on the outside of the tower. The system is capable of creating 16 million colours, thanks to a sophisticated system of hardware and software. It has the ability to quickly transition between colours which can create a shocking effect. During Christmas, New Year and other events the tower changes color in animated computer controlled sequences. The unique lighting system of the building, dubbed by its creator Yann Kersal√© as diffraction, who defined it as \\"a vaporous cloud of colour that seeks moir√©\\", is often used in the celebration of various events such as the naming of Barcelona as the capital of the Union for the Mediterranean or the 50th anniversary of Treaty of Rome.  A symbol of Barcelona  Once it was finished, the Agbar Tower quickly became an architectural icon of the city of Barcelona and one of its most famous buildings. However, it was not initially immune to criticism from citizens and experts who said that its characteristics did not fit into the architecture of Barcelona. Over time it has become one of the symbols that universally identify the Catalan capital and is one of its tourist attractions. In mid-2008, a number of Catalan public institutions made a list that included the major cultural icons in the Autonomous Community that were meant to serve as models for tourist souvenirs which identity Catalonia, and the tower was included in it. The popularity of the tower to tourists is such that a visit to the tower has become a part of tourist bus routes (and even the helicopter tour) and many tourists take an opportunity to visit the inside. = Ringing in the New Year = Since 2006, TV3, the main Catalan regional television service, has used the capabilities the special lighting system at the Agbar Tower offered to show end of year celebrations. This has become the venue chosen by thousands of locals and visitors to the city to welcome the New Year. This choice of the tower as an icon of the city for New Year celebrations have allowed Barcelona to begin to appear on television around the world alongside those of famous landmarks in cities such as Sydney, Madrid, Paris, London or New York City. Prior to 2006 this did not occur because the places chosen by TV3 lacked the international recognition that the Jean Nouvel tower provides.  Curiosities The tower has twice been climbed by Alain Robert. The first, on 3 August 2006, was an action that sought to call for peace in the conflict in Lebanon. The second was in September 2007. *In 2007, \\"Torre Agbar\\" was recorded in the Spanish Patent and Trademark office, by the company Aig√ºes de Barcelona, for use as a brand of alcoholic beverages. *In 2011, the tower received a green building award from the European Council for its energy efficiency and low CO2 emissions.

The group mixes humour and comedy in their brand of hip hop, crafting original (and largely fictional) rap saga of the underground culture in the east side of Helsinki. Notkea Rotta heavily parodies - or pays tribute to - American gangsta rap. Notkea Rotta released their debut single \\"Pohin√§√§\\" with Karelia Records, which became an instant urban classic. \\"Pohin√§√§\\" topped at #7 on the Finnish Single list. The debut album Panokset piippuun, p√∂hin√§t p√∂ntt√∂√∂n (also on Karelia Records) cemented Notkea Rotta's place in the cult of Suomi-R√§p. Their lyrical subject matter mostly deals with common Finnish street drugs (especially amphetamine), sex and the occasional clashes with the police. The group raps exclusively in Finnish, using a lot of Helsinki slang vocabulary, making it rather difficult for non-speakers to understand the lyrics.

It convened to nominate successors to President Theodore Roosevelt and Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks. U.S. Secretary of War William H. Taft of Ohio won Roosevelt's endorsement and received the presidential nomination. The convention nominated New York Representative James S. Sherman to be his vice presidential running mate. The Platform The Republican platform celebrated the Roosevelt administration's economic policies such as the keeping of the protective tariff, establishment of a permanent currency system (the Federal Reserve), additional government supervision and control over trusts. It championed enforcement of railroad rate laws, giving the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to investigate interstate railroads, and reduction of work hours for railroad workers, as well as general reduction in the work week. In foreign policy, it supported a buildup of the armed forces, protection of American citizens abroad, extension of foreign commerce, vigorous arbitration and the Hague treaties, a revival of the U.S. Merchant Marine, support of war veterans, self-government for Cuba and the Philippines with citizenship for residents of Puerto Rico. In other areas, it advocated court reform, creation of a federal Bureau of Mines and Mining, extension of rural mail delivery, environmental conservation, upholding of the rights of African-Americans and the civil service, and greater efficiency in national public health agencies. The platform lastly expressed pride in U.S. involvement in the building of the Panama Canal, the admission of the New Mexico and Arizona Territories; called for the celebration of the birthday of Abraham Lincoln; and generally deplored the Democratic Party while celebrating the policies of the Republicans. The platform explained the differences between democracy and republicanism in which the Republicans made clear that democracy was leaning towards socialism and republicanism towards individualism which is actually consistent with modern party critiques.

Burrows of Michigan Presidential Candidates Prior to the convention, Vice President Charles Fairbanks and New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes both seemed like plausible nominees, but Roosevelt was determined to pick his own successor. Though Roosevelt preferred Secretary of State Elihu Root, Root's age and background in corporate law made him an unpalatable nominee, so Roosevelt instead supported Secretary of War William Howard Taft. Entering the convention, Taft, buoyed by the support of the popular Roosevelt, was virtually assured of the nomination. Taft won the presidential nomination on the first ballot, overcoming Fairbanks and the other candidates.

Early life Ott was born on 1970 in Berkeley, California and began playing music at the age of four. He was physically and sexually abused as a child and ran away from home at the age of 13. Ott became a gutter punk, living on the streets of Berkeley for 11 years. Crimpshrine: 1982-1989 Ott joined his first band, S.A.G., in 1982 at age 12. His 13-year-old friends Aaron Cometbus and Jesse Michaels (later of Operation Ivy) played guitar and sang.Sleep, What's That? liner notes.

Retrieved 2014-08-24 Fifteen: 1989-2000 With Jack Curran, Ott formed a new group called Fifteen, who went on to record two LPs for Lookout! Records and several more on a few smaller labels. For Fifteen, Ott changed his singing style drastically in order to save his voice. The group went through many lineup changes before breaking up in 1996, and then reformed in 1997, only to break up again in 2000. Solo career and after: 2000-present Toward the end of Fifteen, Ott released the 1998 solo acoustic album, Epithysial Union, which also featured songs by Amanda Ketchum (billed only as \\"Amanda'\\"). In 2000 Ott sold everything he had to buy a house and support his children. He pursued a solo career for several years, releasing the double album, Will Work for Diapers in 2003. In 2003 he entered nursing school and went on to train as a nurse practitioner. In 2007 he stopped recording music in order to devote more time to his studies. In December 2011 his band Fifteen reunited to play two Bay Area benefit shows. He now is a nurse and is helping drug addicts. Writing Ott's politically charged lyrics tackle issues such as racism, homophobia, misogyny, classism, drug abuse, needle exchange, civil rights, gender roles, homelessness, addiction, environmentalism, social injustice, political conspiracy, and rape. His solo work uses many of the same songs and lyrical themes as his rock-band work.

It was based on Michael Crichton's 1992 novel of the same name.Variety film review; August 2, 1993. Plot During a commencement gala at the newly opened Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a Japanese keiretsu, a call girl named Cheryl Lynn Austin, is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter. Police Detectives Webster \\"Web\\" Smith and John Connor, a former police captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to act as liaison between the Japanese executives and the investigating officer, Smith's former partner Tom Graham. During the initial investigation, Connor and Smith review surveillance camera footage, and realize that one of the discs is missing. Smith and Connor suspect Eddie Sakamura, Cheryl's yakuza boyfriend, of killing her, and interrogate him at a house party. Sakamura promises to bring Connor something, and Connor reluctantly lets him go after confiscating his passport. Ishihara, a Nakamoto employee whom Connor had previously interrogated, delivers the missing disc, which clearly shows Sakamura killing Cheryl. Graham and Smith lead a SWAT raid on Sakamura's house. He tries to flee in a sports car, but crashes and is killed. Smith learns that Sakamura had attempted to contact him about the missing disc, so he and Connor take the disc to an expert, Jingo Asakuma, who reveals that the disc has been digitally altered to implicate Sakamura. Nakamoto is in the midst of sensitive negotiations for the acquisition of an American semiconductor company, with Senator John Morton, a guest at the party, abruptly changing his stance on a bill that would prevent the merger from going through. Suspecting his sudden shift is somehow related to the murder, Connor and Smith attempt to interview him at his campaign office, but without success. Upon returning to Smith's apartment, the duo find Sakamura alive and well. He reveals that he was being tailed that day by Tanaka, a Nakamoto security agent attempting to locate the original disc. Not wanting to be seen with Sakamura, Tanaka stole his sports car and committed suicide by crashing it. Sakamura gives Connor the original disc, but before he can leave, Lt. Graham arrives with Ishihara. Sakamura is killed fighting off Ishihara's men, and Smith is shot and left for dead, surviving only thanks to a bulletproof vest. After being interrogated, Smith is put on paid leave due to an ongoing investigation of an earlier corruption charge. Regrouping with Connor and Jingo, the three view the original surveillance footage, which shows Senator Morton performing erotic asphyxiation on Cheryl. Falsely believing he killed her, Morton changes his position on the regulation bill to stay in Nakamoto's good graces. After leaving the boardroom, the footage shows another figure approaching and killing Cheryl by strangulation. Hoping to draw the killer out, Connor and Smith fax Morton stills of the footage showing his involvement in the murder. Morton contacts Ishihara, revealing the executive to be in on the cover-up, and then Morton commits suicide. Connor, Smith, and Jingo interrupt the merger negotiations to show Nakamoto President Yoshida the surveillance footage. Bob Richmond, an American lawyer working for Nakamoto, reveals himself as the killer and tries to run away, only to be killed by Sakamura's friends. Yoshida maintains his and his colleagues innocence, quietly exiling Ishihara to a desk job back in Japan. Smith drives Jingo home, where she casts doubt on whether Richmond was really the murderer, or if he was simply taking the fall to protect someone higher up in the company.

He is mostly known for his work as a DJ, a VJ for MTV and as a comedian. Biography =Radio career= In 1996, Sounds started as an intern with Wildman Steve and DJ Riz of New York's Flip Squad, and eventually Riz asked Sounds to spin at clubs with him as an opening DJ. Later on, Lil' Kim asked him to go on tour with her. For a year and a half Sounds worked with Lil' Kim, touring the country and Europe. After he returned to the U.S., Hot 97's Funkmaster Flex asked Sounds to join his Big Dawg Pitbulls crew. He became a mix show DJ on Funkmaster Flex's evening show on Hot 97, and he eventually got his own show called Cipha Saturdays at the same station. On Sirius Satellite Radio's Shade 45 channel, he hosted a show called The Cipha Sounds Effect along with Angela Yee, DJ Wonder and the Emoticon Farragut Foster. He started the show in 2004, and his last show was on July 1, 2008. Before moving on from Shade 45, Sounds started The Juan Epstein Podcast which became the weekend morning show on Hot 97 with Peter Rosenberg. It aired every Sunday from 4am to 9am. The show was called The Cipha/Rosenberg Experience, and they were given a Saturday morning slot from 6am to 10am. HOT 97 later moved The Cipha/Rosenberg Experience to Mon-Fri 5am to 7am, which later grew to 5am to 10am. The HOT 97 Morning Show later added Ebro Darden and Laura Stylez. Cipha Sounds is known for being the first to play Rihanna, Rick Ross, and more on NYC Radio. When Angie Martinez left HOT 97 to move to POWER 105.1, Cipha took over her slot on Weekday afternoons. After months of growing tension, and less than 24 hours after he had criticized management on a podcast regarding his removal as interim host of the afternoon show, Cipha was fired from Hot 97. He was ultimately with the station for more than 17 years. It was announced on February 20, 2015, that Cipha Sounds had signed with ROC Nation Controversy On December 17, 2010, Cipha Sounds stated on the air that \\"the reason [he is] HIV negative is because [he doesn't] mess with Haitian girls\\". Immediate outrage came from some in the Haitian community and others in New York to have him fired from Hot 97. He offered an apology shortly thereafter, remarking that it was simply \\"a stupid, tasteless joke\\" that was \\"taken totally the wrong way\\". These remarks also drew criticism from other radio personalities namely Charlamagne Tha God, co-host of The Breakfast Club Power 105.1, in which he responded on- air by nominating Cipha Sounds for the show's \\"Donkey of the Day\\" (but instead for the \\"Year\\") and said: > \\"I'm from the south, so I know about hatred toward ethnic groups. So when he > said that he reps Haitians heavy and he says 'sak pase' before all his > parties, it was the equivalent to a racist red neck getting called out on > being racist and saying to the people, I'm not racist, all my best friends > are black.

In April 2006, he became the host of MTV's urban music video program Direct Effect which later became Sucker Free. =Music management and production= Sounds has his own artist management company called Jack Move, Inc.

It is associated with Aix-Marseille University and is part of a network of ten Institut d'√©tudes politiques, known as IEP. Sciences Po Aix is renowned on a national level for its law studies and defense & international security studies. Location Sciences Po Aix is housed in a h√¥tel particulier, considered a Monument historique, designed by architect Georges Vallon in 1734.French Ministry of Culture: Facult√© de DroitDominique Auzias, Aix-en- Provence, Le Petit Fut√©, 2008, p. 142 The building is located on the Place de l'universit√© (\\"town square of the university\\"), opposite Cath√©drale Saint- Sauveur on the rue Gaston de Saporta in Aix-en-Provence. This building previously housed the Faculty of Law of Aix-Marseille University. Overview As a grande √©cole, its admissions process is highly selective. Entry to Sciences Po Aix is conditioned by selection tests. The main test is designed for students who would like to join the institute as freshmen. Each year, there are more than 10 000 candidates. The selection rates are inferior to 10%. Sciences Po Aix specializes in political sciences. Therefore, the institute offers courses in economics, history, law, international relations, social sciences and business. The IEP provides students with a general training in law, economics, general knowledge and history. Its students are selected through a competitive entrance examination. Some of its students have become company directors or government officials. Many students move on to careers in journalism, finance, state administration, diplomacy or communications. The academic course lasts five years. It is composed of a three-year undergraduate programme and a two-year graduate programme. The primary diploma is equivalent to a master's degree. The third year of the Sciences Po Aix curriculum is a year of mobility abroad. Students have the choice, they can spend two semesters in a foreign university, one semester in a university and one semester internship or they also have the opportunity to spend two semesters as a trainee. Thereby, Sciences Po Aix have concluded more than 130 exchange partnerships with different universities around the globe so that Sciences Po students can study in many countries during their third year. All continents of the world are represented, there are some partnerships in the United States (Wellesley College, Loyola University Chicago, Arizona State University, Florida International University...), in Canada (University of Montreal, University of Ottawa) in South America (University of Buenos Aires, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in Africa (Rhodes University), in Asia (Shanghai International Studies University, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, Waseda University in Tokyo), in Oceania (University of New South Wales in Sydney, University of Canterbury) and also in Europe (Free University of Berlin, LUISS University in Roma, Middlesex University in London...). History Sciences Po Aix was established in 1956. It is the heir of the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques, created by √âmile Boutmy in 1872, in response to a need for reform for the society and the republican state that has just been born, after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. In September 2007, Philippe S√©guin (1943‚Äì2010), then President of the Court of Audit (in French Cour des comptes), was elected President of the Administration Council, succeeding Jean-Paul Proust (1940‚Äì2010), Minister of the Principality of Monaco. In July 2010, the former French minister of economy and current managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, member of the Administration Council since 2008 and 1977 graduate, was elected President.Communiqu√© de presse de l'IEP d'Aix-en- Provence, ¬´ Christine Lagarde succ√®de √† Philippe S√©guin √† la t√™te du CA de Sciences Po Aix¬ª Directors 1956-1974: Paul de Geouffre de la Pradelle * 1974-1979: Charles Cadoux * 1979-1984: Yves Daudet * 1984-1996: Jacques Bourdon * 1996-2006: Jean-Claude Ricci * 2006-2014: Christian Duval * 2015-: Rostane Mehdi The directors of Sciences Po Aix are elected for a five-year term by the executive board of the school. Some members of this board have been elected such students, teachers and staff representatives. The executive board votes the pedagogical and administrative orientations and reforms proposed by the director, the budget of the school as well as the conventions with the foreign universities.

Typically these are then used for bulk email or spam. =Methods= The simplest method involves spammers purchasing or trading lists of email addresses from other spammers. Another common method is the use of special software known as \\"harvesting bots\\" or \\"harvesters\\", which spider Web pages, postings on Usenet, mailing list archives, internet forums and other online sources to obtain email addresses from public data. Spammers may also use a form of dictionary attack in order to harvest email addresses, known as a directory harvest attack, where valid email addresses at a specific domain are found by guessing email address using common usernames in email addresses at that domain. For example, trying alan@example.com, alana@example.com, @example.com, etc. and any that are accepted for delivery by the recipient email server, instead of rejected, are added to the list of theoretically valid email addresses for that domain. Another method of email address harvesting is to offer a product or service free of charge as long as the user provides a valid email address, and then use the addresses collected from users as spam targets. Common products and services offered are jokes of the day, daily bible quotes, news or stock alerts, free merchandise, or even registered sex offender alerts for one's area. Another technique was used in late 2007 by the company iDate, which used email harvesting directed at subscribers to the Quechup website to spam the victim's friends and contacts.  Harvesting sources  Spammers may harvest email addresses from a number of sources. A popular method uses email addresses which their owners have published for other purposes. Usenet posts, especially those in archives such as Google Groups, frequently yield addresses. Simply searching the Web for pages with addresses  such as corporate staff directories or membership lists of professional societies  using spambots can yield thousands of addresses, most of them deliverable. Spammers have also subscribed to discussion mailing lists for the purpose of gathering the addresses of posters. The DNS and WHOIS systems require the publication of technical contact information for all Internet domains; spammers have illegally trawled these resources for email addresses. Spammers have also concluded that generally, for the domain names of businesses, all of the email addresses will follow the same basic pattern and thus are able to accurately guess the email addresses of employees whose addresses they have not harvested. Many spammers use programs called web spiders to find email address on web pages. Usenet article message-IDs often look enough like email addresses that they are harvested as well. Spammers have also harvested email addresses directly from Google search results, without actually spidering the websites found in the search. Spammer viruses may include a function which scans the victimized computer's disk drives (and possibly its network interfaces) for email addresses. These scanners discover email addresses which have never been exposed on the Web or in Whois. A compromised computer located on a shared network segment may capture email addresses from traffic addressed to its network neighbors. The harvested addresses are then returned to the spammer through the bot-net created by the virus. In addition, sometime the addresses may be appended with other information and cross referenced to extract financial and personal data. A recent, controversial tactic, called \\"e-pending\\", involves the appending of email addresses to direct-marketing databases. Direct marketers normally obtain lists of prospects from sources such as magazine subscriptions and customer lists. By searching the Web and other resources for email addresses corresponding to the names and street addresses in their records, direct marketers can send targeted spam email. However, as with most spammer \\"targeting\\", this is imprecise; users have reported, for instance, receiving solicitations to mortgage their house at a specific street address  with the address being clearly a business address including mail stop and office number. Spammers sometimes use various means to confirm addresses as deliverable. For instance, including a hidden Web bug in a spam message written in HTML may cause the recipient's mail client to transmit the recipient's address, or any other unique key, to the spammer's Web site. Users can defend against such abuses by turning off their mail program's option to display images, or by reading email as plain-text rather than formatted. Likewise, spammers sometimes operate Web pages which purport to remove submitted addresses from spam lists. In several cases, these have been found to subscribe the entered addresses to receive more spam. When persons fill out a form, it is often sold to a spammer using a web service or http post to transfer the data. This is immediate and will drop the email in various spammer databases. The revenue made from the spammer is shared with the source. For instance, if someone applies online for a mortgage, the owner of this site may have made a deal with a spammer to sell the address. These are considered the best emails by spammers, because they are fresh and the user has just signed up for a product or service that often is marketed by spam. Legality In many jurisdictions there are anti-spam laws in place that restrict the harvesting or use of email addresses. In Australia, the creation or use of email-address harvesting programs (address harvesting software) is illegal, according to the 2003 anti-spam legislation, only if it is intended to use the email-address harvesting programs to send unsolicited commercial email. The legislation is intended to prohibit emails with 'an Australian connection' - spam originating in Australia being sent elsewhere, and spam being sent to an Australian address. New Zealand has similar restrictions contained in its Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007.http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0007/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM405209http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0007/latest/DLM405134.html In The United States of America, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 made it illegal to initiate commercial email to a recipient where the email address of the recipient was obtained by: * Using an automated means that generates possible electronic mail addresses by combining names, letters, or numbers into numerous permutations. * Using an automated means to extract electronic mail addresses from an Internet website or proprietary online service operated by another person, and such website or online service included, at the time the address was obtained, a notice stating that the operator of such website or online service will not give, sell, or otherwise transfer addresses maintained by such website or online service to any other party for the purposes of initiating, or enabling others to initiate, electronic mail messages. Furthermore, website operators may not distribute their legitimately collected lists. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 requires that operators of web sites and online services should include a notice that the site or service will not give, sell, or otherwise transfer addresses, maintained by such website or online service, to any other party for the purposes of initiating, or enabling others to initiate, electronic mail messages. Countermeasures ; Address munging : Address munginge.g., changing \\"bob@example.com\\" to \\"bob at example dot com\\"is a common technique to make harvesting email addresses more difficult. Though relatively easy to overcomesee, e.g., this Google search it is still effective.Silvan M√ºhlemann, 20 July 2008, Nine ways to obfuscate e-mail addresses compared It is somewhat inconvenient to users, who must examine the address and manually correct it. ; Images : Using images to display part or all of an email address is a very effective harvesting countermeasure. The processing required to automatically extract text from images is not economically viable for spammers. It is very inconvenient for users, who type the address in manually. ; Contact forms : Email contact forms which send an email but do not reveal the recipient's address avoid publishing an email address in the first place. However, this method prevents users from composing in their preferred email client, limits message content to plain text - and does not automatically leave the user with a record of what they've said in their \\"sent\\" mail folder. ; JavaScript obfuscation : JavaScript email obfuscation produces a normal, clickable email link for users while obscuring the address from spiders. In the source code seen by harvesters, the email address is scrambled, encoded, or otherwise obfuscated. While very convenient for most users, it does reduce accessibility, e.g. for text-based browsers and screen readers, or for those not using a JavaScript-enabled browser.Roel Van Gils, A List Apart, 6 November 2007, Graceful Email Obfuscation ; HTML obfuscation : In HTML, email addresses may be obfuscated in many ways, such as inserting hidden elements within the address or listing parts out of order and using CSS to restore the correct order. Each has the benefit of being transparent to most users, but none support clickable email links and none are accessible to text-based browsers and screen readers. ; CAPTCHA : Requiring users to complete a CAPTCHA before giving out an email address is an effective harvesting countermeasure. A popular solution is the reCAPTCHA Mailhide service. (Note, 12.9.18: Mailhide is no longer supported.)Mailhide: Free Spam Protection ; CAN-SPAM Notice : To enable prosecution of spammers under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, a website operator must post a notice that \\"the site or service will not give, sell, or otherwise transfer addresses maintained by such website or online service to any other party for the purposes of initiating, or enabling others to initiate, electronic mail messages.\\"\\"15 U.S. Code ¬ß 7704 - Other protections for users of commercial electronic mail\\", Section a.4.b.1.A.i ; Mail Server Monitoring : Email servers use a variety of methods to combat directory harvesting attacks, including to refuse to communicate with remote senders that have specified more than one invalid recipient address within a short time, but most such measures carry the risk of legitimate email being disrupted. ; Spider Traps : A spider trap is a part of a website which is a honeypot designed to combat email harvesting spiders.SEO Glossary: \\"A spider trap refers to either a continuous loop where spiders are requesting pages and the server is requesting data to render the page or an intentional scheme designed to identify (and \\"ban\\") spiders that do not respect robots.txt.\\" Well-behaved spiders are unaffected, as the website's robots.txt file will warn spiders to stay away from that areaa warning that malicious spiders do not heed.

Death, released on August 12, 1988https://metalinvader.net/death-leprosy/, by Combat Records. Notably different in tone and quality from the 1987 debut, it is the first example of Scott Burns' work heard on many of the death metal and grindcore albums of that era. The cover is featured in Metal: A Headbanger's Journey. It is the first album to feature drummer Bill Andrews and the only one to feature guitarist Rick Rozz. In a death metal special by the German \\"Rock Hard\\" Magazine, Leprosy was voted the no. 1 of the 25 most important death metal albums of all time. A deluxe re-issue of the album was released in April 2014. The title track \\"Leprosy\\" was covered by the blackened death metal band Akercocke on their 2007 album Antichrist. Dutch melodic death metal band Callenish Circle covered \\"Pull the Plug\\" as a bonus on their Flesh Power Dominion album, released in 2002; shortly thereafter, Norwegian band Zyklon also recorded \\"Pull the Plug\\" to be used as a bonus track. Finnish thrash metal band Mokoma covered the track \\"Open Casket\\", with lyrics in Finnish and titled \\"Avoin Hauta\\", on their EP Viides Vuodenaika. \\"Pull the Plug\\" was also covered by American band Revocation.

It was created as one of the French Institutes of Political Studies. The school's focus is on educating France's political and diplomatic personnel, but its academic focus spans not only the political and economic sciences, but also law, communications, finance, business, urban policy, management, and journalism.  History and organisation  Sciences Po Lille was created by decree in 1991. As all IEP, it aims to give its students training in the civil service, but it specialises in European and International studies. The institute also has an agreement with the renowned school of Journalism Ecole Sup√©rieure de Journalisme de Lille. It also proposes highly selective dual degrees with universities in Spain, England and Germany. The curriculum at the IEP is at the crossroads of law, history, economics, political science and sociology. Students are taught at least two foreign languages and spend one year abroad. Entrance to the IEP can be achieved through highly selective exams.  Campus  At the time of its establishment in 1991, Sciences Po Lille was located in the premises of the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Journalisme de Lille, 50 rue Gauthier de Ch√¢tillon. Built in the 19th century, the building was located in the quartier latin of Lille, which used to be where all Lille's universities were located. The building quickly turned out to be too small for both schools. Thus, in 1996, in order to keep growing, Sciences Po Lille moved into a bigger building, this time located in a working-class district called . The choice of this district was political. The municipality of Lille wished to enhance social diversity in the neighbourhood. Sciences Po Lille's students being mostly from high income and educational backgrounds, its presence in the Moulins district was seen as a way to reinvigorate this southern part of Lille. Sciences Po Lille's new address became 84 rue de Tr√©vise, near the metro station Porte de Valenciennes. The building is a former factory made of red bricks. To cope with the quick development of the school, a new relocation took place in January, 2017. Sciences Po Lille came back to its original area and established its campus rue Auguste-Angelier in the old quartier Latin of Lille. This building of downtown Lille is 8200 square meters. It provides 3 amphitheatres, 40 rooms and a 1500 square meter library. File:Sciences politiques Lille.jpg Sciences_politiques_Lille.jpg  Admission  Sciences Po Lille is one of the most selective French √©coles. Students wishing to attend Sciences Po Lille must pass highly selective and competitive entrance exams composed of a general knowledge test, a history test, and a language test. The rate of admission is, as with all Grandes √©coles, very low: between 5 and 15% of candidates are admitted. There are two admission procedures for the Undergraduate Program. The two of them are collectively organized by Sciences Po Lille and six other Sciences Po (Aix-en-Provence, Lyon, Rennes, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Strasbourg and Toulouse): *the \\"Concours Commun 1ere ann√©e\\" (access to the 1st year of the program). More than 10,000 high schoolers take this exam each year, and only 1000 of them are admitted to one of the 7 Sciences Po of Lille, Aix-en-Provence, Lyon, Rennes, Saint-Germain- en-Laye, Strasbourg and Toulouse. Among them, 150 successful candidates get into Sciences Po Lille. *the \\"Concours Fili√®res Int√©gr√©es\\" (access to the 1st year of the dual degrees). This exam is organized to select the future students of the dual degrees with the university of Salamanca (Spain), the university of Kent (England) and the university of M√ºnster (Germany). They consist of a written test in History, Contemporary Questions and a Language test (varies according to the program). After which there is an oral test in the language of the program, where only half of the previously selected students will be chosen to go through. * the \\"Concours Commun 2e ann√©e\\" (direct access to the 2nd year of the program) Admission procedures for Graduate Programs: * Procedure for French students. The selection process is done through an exam. About 60 students per year enroll directly in one of Sciences Po Lille's Master's programs without having attended the undergraduate program. * International Graduate Admissions Procedure. Admission is based on the holistic assessment of each candidate's academic, personal and professional background. International applicants are required to submit the following documents: a cover letter, two recommendation letters, a resume written in French, the copy of the applicant's academic degree, the student's academic record of the last three years prior to the application (grades), and a French Language Certificate (minimum required: B2). *Special Entrance Exam for Chinese Applicants. This exam gives access to a limited number of Master's programs (Corporate and Government Communication; Sustainable Development; Management of Cultural Institutions; and the Dual Degree with the √âcole sup√©rieure de journalisme de Lille.

He is part of the Lumbee tribe. He is best known for his work with the World Wrestling Federation (later known as World Wrestling Entertainment) under the ring name Tatanka from 1991 to 1996 and 2005 to 2007. His ring name is a Lakota word that means \\"buffalo\\". Bodybuilding and football careers Chavis started competing in powerlifting. He competed in his first bodybuilding contest, Mr. Virginia Beach, placing second. He won many competitions during his time in bodybuilding, but decided against competing on the national level and possibly turning pro. From 1985 to 1990 he worked for Bally's Health and Tennis Corporation, becoming a divisional manager. Chavis went to the open try outs during the 1987 strike for scabs, for the Miami Dolphins and was not offered a position. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1989-1990)= In 1989, Chavis left Bally's to pursue an accounting career. He met \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers in Florida at a video store while looking for wrestling tapes. Rogers had Chavis call Larry Sharpe, who ran a wrestling school in southern New Jersey called \\"The Monster Factory\\". He had his first match, as Tatanka, against Joe Thunder in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 13, 1990. Rogers introduced Chavis to George Scott, the booker for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) during the 1980s. Scott was starting his own promotion called the North American Wrestling Association, later known as South Atlantic Pro Wrestling. Chavis wrestled under the name \\"The War Eagle\\" Chris Chavis and was voted third runner up for Rookie of the Year in Pro Wrestling Illustrated for 1990. Also in 1990, he became the South Atlantic Heavyweight Champion by beating Ken Shamrock (then wrestling as Vince Torelli). Not long after, he was signed to a WWF contract. =World Wrestling Federation= Undefeated streak (1991-1993) Chavis received his first tryout match with the WWF on January 8, 1991 against Dale Wolfe at a WWF Wrestling Challenge taping in Chattanooga, TN. He received a second tryout on February 18, 1991, against the Brooklyn Brawler at a WWF Superstars taping in Orlando, Florida. Wrestling as the War Eagle, Chavis was victorious. He followed it up with another win against Dale Wolfe the next day at a Wrestling Challenge taping. On October 21 he received what was likely another tryout match at a Superstars taping, this time defeating Skinner. In November Chavis began wrestling on house shows under his given name. Soon after, he took on the ring name \\"Tatanka\\". After wrestling in tryout matches at house shows, Tatanka made his television debut as a fan favorite on the February 1, 1992, episode of Superstars, defeating Pat Tanaka in his debut match. As Tatanka, Chavis performed a war dance to the Lumbee tribal war cry that preceded his entrance to the ring, and had a red stripe dyed in the middle of his hair. Tatanka was pushed as undefeated on WWF television; he did not suffer any defeat by pinfall or submission, but he lost several matches at house shows, the first being a countout loss to Rick Martel on June 4, 1992, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Tatanka's earliest rivalry on television was against Martel; it culminated in Tatanka's pay-per-view debut, at WrestleMania VIII, with Tatanka winning the match. On May 18, 1992, Tatanka reached the peak of his success by winning the 40-man Bashed in the USA battle royal. He renewed his \\"feud\\" with Martel, who had stolen sacred eagle feathers from him to add to his wardrobe, going on to defeat Martel again at Survivor Series to reclaim the feathers. At WrestleMania IX, Tatanka received his first televised title shot in the WWF, against Shawn Michaels for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Tatanka won the match by countout. Since a title could not change hands on a countout, Michaels retained the title. On the October 30, 1993, edition of Superstars, Tatanka suffered his first televised defeat in the WWF, losing to Ludvig Borga (Borga had hit Tatanka in the back with a steel chair while Mr. Fuji distracted the referee). After the match, he was attacked by WWF champion Yokozuna and was subsequently out of action for three months. Tatanka returned to the WWF in the beginning of 1994. He was scheduled to face Borga in a rematch at the Royal Rumble, but Borga injured his ankle just days before the event. Borga was replaced by Bam Bam Bigelow, who Tatanka defeated. Bigelow, however, would go on to eliminate Tatanka from the 30-man Royal Rumble match. Million Dollar Corporation (1994-1996) Tatanka was honored by retired professional wrestlers Chief Jay Strongbow and Chief Wahoo McDaniel and by Lumbee tribesman Ray Littleturtle on an edition of Raw. Littleturtle presented him with a full- length Lumbee tribe chief headdress. Tatanka engaged in a storyline feud with Irwin R. Schyster, who insisted he pay a gift tax on the item. Strongbow briefly served as Tatanka's mentor and manager during the duration of the feud. During the summer of 1994, Tatanka accused Lex Luger of selling out to Ted DiBiase, which resulted in a match between the two. Afterward, DiBiase entered the ring with a red, white and blue bag full of money. Luger kicked the bag out of DiBiase's hands resulting in Tatanka attacking him and turning him into a villain at SummerSlam, joining DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. He spent the remainder of the year feuding with Luger which topped off in a cage match on Raw that saw Luger come out the victor. In spring 1995, Tatanka had another feud with Bam Bam Bigelow, who just turned face. As a result, he teamed with Sycho Sid at the King of the Ring pay-per- view to lose to Bigelow and Diesel. Tatanka was suspended on Aug 30, reportedly as a preemptive measure for being named in a lawsuit to be filed by a woman stemming from an incident in Anaheim, CA, following a WWF event in late 1994. According to sources, the woman was said to have been drugged, sodomized and her head shaved on only one side. Kevin Nash reiterated this story in an interview with Kayfabe Commentaries. The woman was having drinks with him and Undertaker the night prior. When the wrestlers were leaving the hotel the following morning, Nash noticed that she was seated in between two police officers. The hallway was smeared in blood. She had half her head shaven as she was crying, reporting the incident to the officers. In the interview, however, Nash presumed the person who did this was Jimmy Del Ray because of similar stories of Del Ray. During representation by Tatanka's attorney the facts showed that Tatanka was not involved in the incident at all and Del Ray was fired from the company; Tatanka's suspension was lifted and he returned with full-pay to the active WWF roster. As Nash noted in his interview, he knew that Tatanka was not involved at all, but he had been around Del Ray that night, which caused Tatanka to also be named and unfairly suspended. Following this hiatus at the end of August 1995, Tatanka returned to the WWF to compete in the Royal Rumble event, where he was eliminated by Diesel. On March 19, 1996, Tatanka wrestled his final televised match in the WWF, losing to the WWF champion Bret Hart in a non-title match. Tatanka left the WWF in the spring of 1996, citing family and spiritual issues. He continued to appear for independent promotions, which allowed him to continue to wrestle while maintaining a lighter schedule. =Independent circuit (1997)= Tatanka with Falcon Coperis in 1997 In 1997, Chavis wrestled for the independent New York-based promotion Ultimate Championship Wrestling (UCW), where he wrestled Bruce Hart of the Hart wrestling family, King Kong Bundy, Jim \\"The Anvil\\" Neidhart and Marty Jannetty. He went from playing the role of a face to a heel when he turned on Falcon Coperis and Tommy Cairo to align himself with the likes of the UWF faction of the organization which included Neidhart, Hart, and eventually Jannetty. Chavis captured the UCW Heavyweight Championship title and handed then-champion Falcon Coperis his first championship defeat. Chavis remained champion until the organization folded its professional wrestling division in 1998. =Return to WWE= Feud with MNM (2005‚àí2006) Eugene and Tatanka in the ring, during Tatanka's return in August 2005 On August 1, 2005, Chavis returned to Raw as a face once again which was intended to be a special one-time appearance to face Eugene in the \\"Eugene Invitational\\", a three-minute match with Kurt Angle's Olympic gold medal on the line. Tatanka lost the match when Angle attacked Eugene with 27 seconds remaining, causing a disqualification. Chavis returned to a full-time schedule for WWE at the tail end of 2005, debuting at a December 27 house show, teaming with Shelton Benjamin in a win over Carlito and Jonathan Coachman. He returned to television in the Royal Rumble match at the January 2006 event, where he was eliminated by Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro. The next month he began appearing on Velocity before being moved full-time to the SmackDown! brand. As a face, Chavis teamed with Matt Hardy to defeat MNM, the then-Tag Team Champions, in a non-title match at No Way Out. They were granted a title shot on the next edition of SmackDown!, but lost. On the April 28 SmackDown! a vignette played announcing that \\"a new warrior would soon be forged in Tatanka.\\" Over the next three weeks footage aired of Tatanka being (legitimately) adopted into the Oglala Sioux Tribe (Lakota). When he returned to wrestling Tatanka defeated Simon Dean with his new finisher, \\"Wakinyan\\" (from the Lakota word for \\"Thunder\\"). Various feuds and departure (2006‚àí2007) On the September 1, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, he lost to The Miz in Miz's debut match, and would later lose a rematch to Miz as well. Tatanka engaged in a mini-feud with Sylvain Grenier, trading victories with him, before he was moved into an angle where he entered into a losing streak due to what he perceived to be bad decision-making by referees during his matches, especially Charles Robinson. This escalated until the October 27 SmackDown! when Tatanka, alongside partner Bobby Lashley, lost a match to William Regal and Dave Taylor when Regal pinned Tatanka by illegally using the ropes after (During the pin Dave Taylor got his hands in the last second). After the match Tatanka argued the decision again, then he turned heel by attacking the referee and then Lashley when he tried to calm him down. The next week he appeared on SmackDown! with a new style of warpaint, covering the top of his face in black and the bottom in white, and cut a promo on Lashley saying he owed neither him nor the crowd an explanation for his actions. He compared his recent losing streak to the years of persecution that his people had suffered over the years and said that he \\"called upon his forefathers to unleash a new warrior in [him]\\" and also said if Lashley went to war with [me] or war with a whole nation of warriors. He asked for and was released from his WWE contract on January 19, 2007, but not before ending his losing streak by defeating Jimmy Wang Yang, his first victory in months. WWE.com noted this event with these parting words: \\"Tatanka is an accomplished veteran of the squared circle. The Native American made a splash upon his entrance to the WWE in the early 90s, remaining undefeated for two years.\\" Tatanka stated on his official website that he requested to be released and mentioned he was not done with WWE as he would like to return someday. =Second return to the independent circuit (2008‚Äì2014)= In 2008 Tatanka toured Ireland and France with the American Wrestling Rampage tour. He also wrestled for All Star Promotions in the United Kingdom. He competed in All Star and American Wrestling between August 29 to October 31, 2008, in the Tower Circus area of Blackpool Tower. Tatanka made an appearance in Danish Pro Wrestling (DPW) and lost to Chaos after he was hit by a DDT. He was given a standing ovation after the match. Tatanka appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the December 17, 2009 episode of Impact where he defeated Jay Lethal in a Black Machismo Invitational Match with an End of the Trail. Tatanka also made headlines in Scotland while appearing for Scottish Wrestling Entertainment, renewing his partnership with the Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase in Dundee. Tatanka was due to return to Scotland to wrestle for the SWE at the Dewars Centre in Perth on August 25, 2012. On August 8, 2012, Chikara announced that Tatanka would be making his debut for the promotion in the following month's 2012 King of Trios tournament, where he will team with the 1-2-3 Kid and Aldo Montoya as \\"Team WWF\\". In their first round match on September 14, Team WWF was defeated by The Extreme Trio (Jerry Lynn, Tommy Dreamer and Too Cold Scorpio). The following day, Tatanka defeated Sugar Dunkerton in a singles match. Tatanka made another appearance in Danish Pro Wrestling (DPW) and defeated Chaos after hitting Wykea after a long and enduring match. He was given a standing ovation once again. He also wrestled in Germany, in June 2013 for ACW (Athletik Club Wrestling) and GHW (German Hurricane Wrestling). On May 2, 2014, Tatanka won the DPW Tag Team Championship along with Rick \\"The Prick\\" Dominick. They lost the titles on October 18, 2014 to Ravn and Demolition Davies. =Second return to WWE (2010‚Äìpresent)= Sporadic appearances (2010‚àípresent) Tatanka made an appearance on the Old School Raw on November 15, 2010 backstage along with Ron Simmons, Dusty Rhodes, IRS, and The \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase. On November 3, 2015, WWE announced that they signed Tatanka to a Legends contract. On April 3, 2016, at WrestleMania 32, Tatanka competed in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal as a face, and was among the last to be eliminated. Tatanka is in the WWE 2K17 video game as DLC. He appears in WWE 2K18 and WWE 2K19 as a playable character. Personal life Chavis and his wife, Michelle, have four children; daughters Christiana Mariah (born May 30, 1996) and Rhea Aiyana (born July 1, 2002) and sons Joseph Tatanka (born March 6, 2004) and Jeremiah Chris (born 2009). They live in Spring Hill, Florida. Chavis was previously married to Dawn Doyle on Valentines Day in 1989 in Hampton, Virginia.

He is married to Dorothy Ranaghan, and has six children and twelve grandchildren. Early life Kevin Ranaghan was born in New York City in 1940 to parents of Irish Catholic descent. College While completing his doctoral degree in liturgical studies in the theology department at the University of Notre Dame, Kevin met his future wife, Dorothy. They were married in 1966. Religious conversion Ranaghan heard about a new work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of some friends at Duquesne University. After an initial period of skepticism, their prayer and study led him and his new wife to be baptized in the Holy Spirit on March 5, 1967. Catholic Charismatic renewal In 1969, the Ranaghans published Catholic Pentecostals, the first book detailing the history of this renewal movement and articulating its theological implications. They linked baptism in the Spirit to a renewal of the sacraments of initiation. The book was translated into several languages, and Kevin Ranaghan traveled extensively, both in and out of the United States, to spread the news about this Pentecostal outpouring in the church. His travels brought him into contact not only with Catholic groups throughout the world, but also with groups of Protestants from Pentecostal, mainline, and evangelical streams of Christianity. Ranaghan served as a bridge between Catholics and those from other denominations who, for the first time in history, were experiencing a simultaneous and similar renewal in the Spirit. Committees and conferences Ranaghan was ordained a permanent Catholic deacon in 1973. He joined United States National Service Committee for the Catholic Charismatic Renewal for 15 years, and for 11 years was its executive director.

His Ojibwa name was Kah-Ge-Ga-Gah-Bowh (Gaagigegaabaw in the Fiero orthography), meaning \\"He Who Stands Forever\\". In 1847 he published a memoir about his life and time as a missionary. This work made him Canada's first literary celebrity in the United States. In 1851 he published The Traditional History and Characteristic Sketches of The Ojibway Nation, the first published history of the Ojibwa in English. Biography Copway was born near Trenton, Ontario, into a Mississauga Anishinaabe family; his father John Copway was a Mississauga chief and medicine man. His parents converted to Methodism in 1827. Beginning in the 1830s, the young Copway attended the local mission school.Donald B. Smith, \\"George Copway\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, accessed 10 December 2011 In July 1834, together with an uncle and cousin, he was invited to work with a Methodist minister as a missionary to Ojibwe who lived near the western part of Lake Superior. His activities in two different areas over the next few years included working with Reverend Sherman Hall in La Pointe, Wisconsin to translate the Christian Acts of the Apostles and the Gospel of St Luke into Ojibwa. In 1838 the Methodists provided for Copway's education in Illinois, and later ordained him as a minister. In 1840, Copway met Elizabeth Howell, an English woman whose family were farmers in the Toronto area. They married and moved to Minnesota to serve as missionaries. They had a son, George Albert Copway (1843 ‚Äì 1873) and a daughter Frances Minne-Ha-Ha (Copway) Passmore (1863-1921) during their marriage. The couple later returned to Canada in 1842, where Copway served as a missionary for the Saugeen and Rice Lake Bands of the Ojibwa. He was elected vice-president of the Ojibwe General Council. In 1846, he was accused and convicted of embezzlement by the Indian Department. Because of this, he was defrocked by the Methodists. The Copways moved to New York City, where he wrote and published a memoir, The Life, History and Travels of Kah-ge-ga-gah-Bowh (1847), republished in London in 1850 as Recollections of a forest life; or, the life and travels of Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh. It was the first book published by a Canadian First Nations person. It had six printings in the first year and rapidly became a bestseller. During the 1840s, he toured and lectured in the United States and also traveled to Europe. That travel provided him with the material for his book of sketches of Europe, Running sketches of men and places, in England, France, Germany, Belgium, and Scotland, published in 1851 after his book on the history of the Ojibwe. During this period, Copway acted as an advocate for a Native American territory, suggesting a 150-square mile territory be established in what was the American Midwest east of the Missouri River. The tribes in the area were under increasing pressure of encroachment by European-American settlers. This proposal was never approved by the United States Congress, but Copway attracted considerable attention from leading intellectuals of the time, including the historian Francis Parkman. In 1851, Copway started his own weekly newspaper in New York City, titled Copway's American Indian, which ran for approximately three months. He had attracted \\"letters of support from the eminent ethnologists Lewis Henry Morgan and Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, from Parkman, and from the novelists James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving.\\" George Copway in 1850 Copway's career subsequently spiralled downward as he began drinking heavily and sank into debt, and in 1858 his wife Elizabeth Howell Copway took his daughter, Frances Minne-Ha-Ha, and left him. Copway traveled throughout New York and Michigan as a herbalist 'street healer' and a Union army recruiter. Copway died in 1869 in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Legacy Copway's 1847 memoir and his 1851 history of the Ojibwe The Traditional History and Characteristic Sketches of The Ojibway Nation included many details about their traditional culture. He dedicated a few chapters to the use of birch bark scrolls, the symbolic writing that was used, and the meaning of various symbols. These elaborate scrolls were used to remember songs, history, and ceremonies. The care and reproduction of these scrolls by a select few is described in detail. A recurring theme in Copway's publications is the use of alcohol by Euromericans to weaken Native American social fabric: > The introduction of spirituous liquors...has been greater than all other > evils combined. Intemperance and disease. The fire-water has done its work > of disaster. By it the glad shouts of the youth of our land have died away > in wails of grief! Fathers have followed their children to their graves. > Children have sent their wail of woe, echoing from vale to vale. And around > the cheering fires of the Indian, the white man has received the gain of > avarice. Peace and Happiness entwined around the fire-side of the Indian > once. Union, harmony, and a common brotherhood cemented them all. But as > soon as these vile drinks were introduced, dissipation commenced, and the > ruin and downfall of a noble race has gone on ‚Äî every year lessening their > numbers.George Copway, The Traditional History and Characteristic Sketches > of The Ojibway Nation, B.F.

Kodak Gallery was shut down on July 2, 2012. Photos were transferred to Shutterfly. History Ofoto's online photography service was started in June 1999, in Berkeley, California. The company was founded by Lisa Gansky and Kamran Mohsenin. Gansky had previously been CEO of 1990s internet pioneer GNN, while Mohsenin had previously run Tunes Network, Inc., parent of the Tunes.com music discovery Website. The Ofoto website launched to the public on December 13, 1999, the same day as competing service Shutterfly. While Shutterfly was funded in part by Silicon Valley businessman James Clark, Ofoto was funded in part by Jim Barksdale, Clark's former partner and co-worker from Netscape. This led to the brief \\"Clark vs. Bark\\" photo wars. Ofoto started by simply allowing users to upload JPEG images to the online service, to share online photo albums with friends, and to purchase physical silver-halide prints of photos. In 2000, Ofoto added a 35mm online film processing service and an online frame store. In following years, Ofoto added 4-color offset printed invitations and cards, and services for mobile phones. In May 2001, Ofoto was purchased by Eastman Kodak. Ofoto, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Kodak and later became the Kodak Imaging Network, Inc. In 2005, the Ofoto web service was rebranded as the Kodak EasyShare Gallery.

Unlike survey meters, gamma counters are designed to measure small samples of radioactive material, typically with automated measurement and movement of multiple samples. Operation Gamma counters are usually scintillation counters. In a typical system, a number of samples are placed in sealed vials or test tubes, and moved along a track. One at a time, they move down inside a shielded detector, set to measure specific energy windows characteristic of the particular isotope. Within this shielded detector there is a scintillation crystal that surrounds the radioactive sample. Gamma rays emitted from the radioactive sample interact with the crystal, are absorbed, and light is emitted. A detector, such as a photomultiplier tube converts the visible light to an electrical signal. Depending on the half-life and concentration of the sample, measurement times may vary from 0.02 minutes to several hours. If the photon has too low of an energy level it will be absorbed into the scintillation crystal and never be detected. If the photon has too high of an energy level the photons may just pass right through the crystal without any interaction. Thus the thickness of the crystal is very important when sampling radioactive materials using the Gamma Counter. Applications Gamma counters are standard tools used in the research and development of new radioactive compounds used for diagnosing and treating disease, (as in PET scanning). Gamma counters are used in radiobinding assays,Anti-dsDNA [I-125] Radiobinding Assay Kit At PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.

This difference is due to self-shielding within the active layer of the source which will reduce the SER, or backscatter which will reflect particles off the backing plate of the active layer and will increase the SER. Beta particle plate sources usually have a significant backscatter, whereas alpha plate sources usually have no backscatter, but are easily self-attenuated if the active layer is made too thick.Estimation of calibration factors for surface contamination monitoring instruments for different surfaces.

However the overall detector efficiency is largely affected by attenuation due to the window or tube body through which particles have to pass. In the case of gamma photons the detection efficiency is more dependent upon the fill gas and gamma energy. Low energy photons will interact more with the fill gas than high energy photons.

Such systems enable airliners to land in weather conditions that would otherwise be dangerous or impossible to operate in. Description Autoland systems were designed to make landing possible in visibility too poor to permit any form of visual landing, although they can be used at any level of visibility. They are usually used when visibility is less than 600 meters runway visual range and/or in adverse weather conditions, although limitations do apply for most aircraft‚Äîfor example, for a Boeing 747-400 the limitations are a maximum headwind of 25 kts, a maximum tailwind of 10 kts, a maximum crosswind component of 25 kts, and a maximum crosswind with one engine inoperative of five knots. They may also include automatic braking to a full stop once the aircraft is on the ground, in conjunction with the autobrake system, and sometimes auto deployment of spoilers and thrust reversers. Autoland may be used for any suitably approved instrument landing system (ILS) or microwave landing system (MLS) approach, and is sometimes used to maintain currency of the aircraft and crew, as well as for its main purpose of assisting an aircraft landing in low visibility and/or bad weather. Autoland requires the use of a radar altimeter to determine the aircraft's height above the ground very precisely so as to initiate the landing flare at the correct height (usually about ). The localizer signal of the ILS may be used for lateral control even after touchdown until the pilot disengages the autopilot. For safety reasons, once autoland is engaged and the ILS signals have been acquired by the autoland system, it will proceed to landing without further intervention, and can be disengaged only by completely disconnecting the autopilot (this prevents accidental disengagement of the autoland system at a critical moment) or by initiating an automatic go-around. At least two and often three independent autopilot systems work in concert to carry out autoland, thus providing redundant protection against failures. Most autoland systems can operate with a single autopilot in an emergency, but they are only certified when multiple autopilots are available. The autoland system's response rate to external stimuli work very well in conditions of reduced visibility and relatively calm or steady winds, but the purposefully limited response rate means they are not generally smooth in their responses to varying wind shear or gusting wind conditions ‚Äì i.e., not able to compensate in all dimensions rapidly enough ‚Äì to safely permit their use. The first aircraft to be certified to CAT III standards, on 28 December 1968,Slat Retraction During Reverse Thrust? 747-400 ¬ó Tech Ops Forum  Airliners.net was the Sud Aviation Caravelle, followed by the Hawker-Siddeley HS.121 Trident in May 1972 (CAT IIIA) and to CAT IIIB during 1975. The Trident had been certified to CAT II on 7 February 1968. Autoland capability has seen the most rapid adoption in areas and on aircraft that must frequently operate in very poor visibility. Airports troubled by fog on a regular basis are prime candidates for Category III approaches, and including autoland capability on jet airliners helps reduce the likelihood that they will be forced to divert by bad weather. Autoland is highly accurate. In his 1959 paper,W. J. Charnley (1959). Blind Landing. Journal of Navigation, Vol. 12, No.2, April 1959, p 128 http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S037346330001794X John Charnley, then Superintendent of the UK Royal Aircraft Establishment's (RAE) Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU), concluded a discussion of statistical results by saying that \\"It is fair to claim, therefore, that not only will the automatic system land the aircraft when the weather prevents the human pilot, it also performs the operation much more precisely\\". Previously, autoland systems have been so expensive that they were rarely used on small aircraft. However, as display technology has developed the addition of a head up display (HUD) allows for a trained pilot to manually fly the aircraft using guidance cues from the flight guidance system. This significantly reduces the cost of operating in very low visibility, and allows aircraft that are not equipped for automatic landings to make a manual landing safely at lower levels of look ahead visibility or runway visual range (RVR). In 1989, Alaska Airlines was the first airline in the world to manually land a passenger-carrying jet (Boeing B727) in FAA Category III weather (dense fog) made possible with the head-up guidance system.\\"Alaska Air Group Almanac, November 2004\\" page 3 History =Background= Commercial aviation autoland was initially developed in Great Britain, as a result of the frequent occurrence of very low visibility conditions in winter in North-west Europe. These occur particularly when anticyclones are in place over central Europe in November/December/January when temperatures are low, and radiation fog easily forms in relatively stable air. The severity of this type of fog was exacerbated in the late 1940s and 1950s by the prevalence of carbon and other smoke particles in the air from coal burning heating and power generation. Cities particularly affected included the main [UK] centres, and their airports such as London Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, as well as European cities such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Zurich and Milan. Visibility at these times could become as low as a few feet (hence the \\"London fogs\\" of movie fame) and when combined with the soot created lethal long-persistence smog: these conditions led to the passing of the UK's \\"Clean Air Act\\" which banned the burning of smoke-producing fuel. Post 1945, the British government had established two state-owned airline corporations ‚Äì British European Airways (BEA) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), which were subsequently to be merged into today's British Airways. BEA's route network focused on airports in the UK and Europe, and hence its services were particularly prone to disruption by these particular conditions. During the immediate post-war period, BEA suffered a number of accidents during approach and landing in poor visibility, which caused it to focus on the problems of how pilots could land safely in such conditions. A major breakthrough came with the recognition that in such low visibility the very limited visual information available (lights and so on) was extraordinarily easy to misinterpret, especially when the requirement to assess it was combined with a requirement to simultaneously fly the aircraft on instruments. This led to the development of what is now widely understood as the \\"monitored approach\\" procedure whereby one pilot is assigned the task of accurate instrument flying while the other assesses the visual cues available at decision height, taking control to execute the landing once satisfied that the aircraft is in fact in the correct place and on a safe trajectory for a landing. The result was a major improvement in the safety of operations in low visibility, and as the concept clearly incorporates vast elements of what is now known as crew resource management (although predating this phrase by some three decades) it was expanded to encompass a far broader spectrum of operations than just low visibility. However, associated with this \\"human factors\\" approach was a recognition that improved autopilots could play a major part in low-visibility landings. The components of all landings are the same, involving navigation from a point at altitude en route to a point where the wheels are on the desired runway. This navigation is accomplished using information from either external, physical, visual cues, or from synthetic cues such as flight instruments. At all times, there must be sufficient total information to ensure that the aircraft's position and trajectory (vertical and horizontal) are correct. The problem with low visibility operations is that the visual cues may be reduced to effectively zero, and hence there is an increased reliance on \\"synthetic\\" information. The dilemma faced by BEA was to find a way to operate without cues, because this situation occurred on its network with far greater frequency than on that of any other airline. It was particularly prevalent at its home base ‚Äì London Heathrow Airport ‚Äì which could effectively be closed for days at a time. =Development of autoland= The UK government's aviation research facilities including the Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU) set up during 1945/46 at RAF Martlesham Heath and RAF Woodbridge to research all the relevant factors. BEA's flight technical personnel were heavily involved in BLEU's activities in the development of Autoland for its Trident fleet from the late 1950s. The work included analysis of fog structures, human perception, instrument design, and lighting cues amongst many others. After further accidents, this work also led to the development of aircraft operating minima in the form we know them today. In particular, it led to the requirement that a minimum visibility must be reported as available before the aircraft may commence an approach ‚Äì a concept that had not existed previously. The basic concept of a \\"target level of safety\\" (10-7) and of the analysis of \\"fault trees\\" to determine probability of failure events stemmed from about this period. The basic concept of autoland flows from the fact that an autopilot could be set up to track an artificial signal such as an Instrument Landing System (ILS) beam more accurately than a human pilot could ‚Äì not least because of the inadequacies of the electro-mechanical flight instruments of the time. If the ILS beam could be tracked to a lower height then clearly the aircraft would be nearer to the runway when it reached the limit of ILS usability, and nearer to the runway less visibility would be required to see sufficient cues to confirm the aircraft position and trajectory. With an angular signal system such as ILS, as altitude decreases all tolerances must be decreased ‚Äì in both the aircraft system and the input signal ‚Äì to maintain the required degree of safety. This is because certain other factors ‚Äì physical and physiological laws which govern for example the pilot's ability to make the aircraft respond ‚Äì remain constant. For example, at 300 feet above the runway on a standard 3 degree approach the aircraft will be 6000 feet from the touchdown point, and at 100 feet it will be 2000 feet out. If a small course correction needs 10 seconds to be effected at 180 kts it will take 3000 ft. It will be possible if initiated at 300 feet of height, but not at 100 feet. Consequently, only a smaller course correction can be tolerated at the lower height, and the system needs to be more accurate. This imposes a requirement for the ground-based, guidance element to conform to specific standards, as well as the airborne elements. Thus, while an aircraft may be equipped with an autoland system, it will be totally unusable without the appropriate ground environment. Similarly, it requires a crew trained in all aspects of the operation to recognise potential failures in both airborne and ground equipment, and to react appropriately, to be able to use the system in the circumstances from which it is intended. Consequently, the low visibility operations categories (Cat I, Cat II and Cat III) apply to all 3 elements in the landing ‚Äì the aircraft equipment, the ground environment, and the crew. The result of all this is to create a spectrum of low visibility equipment, in which an aircraft's autoland autopilot is just one component. The development of these systems proceeded by recognising that although the ILS would be the source of the guidance, the ILS itself contains lateral and vertical elements that have rather different characteristics. In particular, the vertical element (glideslope) originates from the projected touchdown point of the approach, i.e. typically 1000 ft from the beginning of the runway, while the lateral element (localiser) originates from beyond the far end. The transmitted glideslope therefore becomes irrelevant soon after the aircraft has reached the runway threshold, and in fact the aircraft has of course to enter its landing mode and reduce its vertical velocity quite a long time before it passes the glideslope transmitter. The inaccuracies in the basic ILS could be seen in that it was suitable for use down to 200 ft. only (Cat I), and similarly no autopilot was suitable for or approved for use below this height. The lateral guidance from the ILS localiser would however be usable right to the end of the landing roll, and hence is used to feed the rudder channel of the autopilot after touchdown. As aircraft approached the transmitter its speed is obviously reducing and rudder effectiveness diminishes, compensating to some extent for the increased sensitivity of the transmitted signal. More significantly however it means the safety of the aircraft is still dependent on the ILS during rollout. Furthermore, as it taxis off the runway and down any parallel taxiway, it itself acts a reflector and can interfere with the localiser signal. This means that it can affect the safety of any following aircraft still using the localiser. As a result, such aircraft cannot be allowed to rely on that signal until the first aircraft is well clear of the runway and the \\"Cat. 3 protected area\\". The result is that when these low visibility operations are taking place, operations on the ground affect operations in the air much more than in good visibility, when pilots can see what is happening. At very busy airports, this results in restrictions in movement which can in turn severely impact the airport's capacity. In short, very low visibility operations such as autoland can only be conducted when aircraft, crews, ground equipment and air and ground traffic control all comply with more stringent requirements than normal. The first \\"commercial development\\" automatic landings (as opposed to pure experimentation) were achieved through realising that the vertical and lateral paths had different rules. Although the localiser signal would be present throughout the landing, the glide slope had to be disregarded before touchdown in any event. It was recognised that if the aircraft had arrived at decision height (200 ft) on a correct, stable approach path ‚Äì a prerequisite for a safe landing ‚Äì it would have momentum along that path. Consequently, the autoland system could discard the glideslope information when it became unreliable (i.e. at 200 ft), and use of pitch information derived from the last several seconds of flight would ensure to the required degree of reliability that the descent rate (and hence adherence to the correct profile) would remain constant. This \\"ballistic\\" phase would end at the height when it became necessary to increase pitch and reduce power to enter the landing flare. The pitch change occurs over the runway in the 1000 horizontal feet between the threshold and the glide slope antenna, and so can be accurately triggered by radio altimeter. Autoland was first developed in BLEU and RAF aircraft such as the English Electric Canberra, Vickers Varsity and Avro Vulcan, and later for BEA's Trident fleet, which entered service in the early 1960s. The Trident was a 3-engined jet built by de Havilland with a similar configuration to the Boeing 727, and was extremely sophisticated for its time. BEA had specified a \\"zero-visibility\\" capability for it to deal with the problems of its fog-prone network. It had an autopilot designed to provide the necessary redundancy to tolerate failures during autoland, and it was this design which had triple redundancy. This autopilot used three simultaneous processing channels each giving a physical output. The fail-safe element was provided by a \\"voting\\" procedure using torque switches, whereby it was accepted that in the event that one channel differed from the other two, the probability of two similar simultaneous failures could be discounted and the two channels in agreement would \\"out- vote\\" and disconnect the third channel. However, this triple-voting system is by no means the only way to achieve adequate redundancy and reliability, and in fact soon after BEA and de Havilland had decided to go down that route, a parallel trial was set up using a \\"dual-dual\\" concept, chosen by BOAC and Vickers for the VC10 4-engined long range aircraft. This concept was later used on the Concorde. Some BAC 1-11 aircraft used by BEA also had a similar system. =Civil aviation= A BEA Hawker Siddeley Trident The earliest experimental autopilot-controlled landings in commercial service were not in fact full auto landings but were termed \\"auto-flare\\". In this mode, the pilot controlled the roll and yaw axes manually while the autopilot controlled the \\"flare\\" or pitch. These were often done in passenger service as part of the development program. The Trident's autopilot had separate engagement switches for the pitch and roll components, and although the normal autopilot disengagement was by means of a conventional control yoke thumb-button, it was also possible to disengage the roll channel while leaving the pitch channel engaged. In these operations the pilot had acquired full visual reference, normally well above decision height, but instead of fully disengaging the autopilot with the thumb-button, called for the second officer to latch off the roll channel only. He then controlled the lateral flight path manually while monitoring the autopilot's continued control of the vertical flight path ‚Äì ready to completely disengage it at the first sign of any deviation. While this sounds as if it may add a risk element in practice it is of course no different in principle to a training pilot monitoring a trainee's handling during on-line training or qualification. Having proven the reliability and accuracy of the autopilot's ability to safely flare the aircraft, the next elements were to add in similar control of the thrust. This was done by a radio altimeter signal which drove the autothrottle servos to a flight idle setting. As the accuracy and reliability of the ground based ILS localiser was increased on a step by step basis, it was permissible to leave the roll channel engaged longer and longer, until in fact the aircraft had ceased to be airborne, and a fully automatic landing had in fact been completed. The first such landing in a BEA Trident was achieved at RAE Bedford (by then home of BLEU) in March 1964. The first on a commercial flight with passengers aboard was achieved on flight BE 343 on 10 June 1965, with a Trident 1 G-ARPR, from Paris to Heathrow with Captains Eric Poole and Frank Ormonroyd. The Lockheed L-1011 TriStar had its autoland functionality placed in key roles during its marketing. Subsequently, autoland systems became available on a number of aircraft types but the primary customers were those mainly European airlines whose networks were severely affected by radiation fog. Early autoland systems needed a relatively stable air mass and could not operate in conditions of turbulence and in particular gusty crosswinds. In North America, it was generally the case that reduced but not zero visibility was often associated with these conditions, and if the visibility really became almost zero in, for example, blowing snow or other precipitation then operations would be impossible for other reasons. As a result, neither airlines nor airports placed a high priority on operations in the lowest visibility. The provision of the necessary ground equipment (ILS) and associated systems for Category 3 operations was almost non existent and the major manufacturers did not regard it as a basic necessity for new aircraft. In general, during the 1970s and 1980s, it was available if a customer wanted it, but at such a high price (due to being a reduced production run item) that few airlines could see a cost justification for it. (This led to the absurd situation for British Airways that as the launch customer for the Boeing 757 to replace the Trident, the brand-new \\"advanced\\" aircraft had inferior all weather operations capability compared to the fleet being broken up for scrap. An indication of this philosophical divide is the comment from a senior Boeing vice president that he could not understand why British Airways were so concerned about the Category 3 certification, as there were only at that time two or three suitable runways in North America on which it could be fully used. It was pointed out that British Airways had 12 such runways on its domestic network alone, four of them at its main base at Heathrow.) However in the 1980s and 1990s, there was increasing pressure globally from customer airlines for at least some improvements in low visibility operations; both for flight regularity and from safety considerations. At the same time, it became evident that the requirement for a true zero-visibility operation (as originally envisaged in the ICAO Category definitions) had diminished, as clean-air laws had reduced the adverse effect of smoke adding to radiation fog in the worst affected areas. Improved avionics meant that the technology became cheaper to implement, and manufacturers raised the standard of the \\"basic\\" autopilot accuracy and reliability. The result was that on the whole the larger new airliners were now able to absorb the costs of at least Category 2 autoland systems into their basic configuration. Simultaneously, pilot organizations globally were advocating the use of Head Up Display systems primarily from a safety viewpoint. Many operators in non-sophisticated environments without many ILS equipped runways were also looking for improvements. The net effect was pressure within the industry to find alternative ways to achieve low visibility operations, such as a \\"hybrid\\" system which used a relatively low reliability autoland system monitored by the pilots via a HUD. Alaska Airlines was a leader in this approach and undertook a lot of development work with Flight Dynamics and Boeing in this respect. However, a major problem with this approach was that European authorities were very reluctant to certificate such schemes as they undermined the well proven concepts of \\"pure\\" autoland systems. This impasse was broken when British Airways became involved as a potential customer for Bombardier's Regional Jet, which could not accommodate a full Cat 3 autoland system, but would be required to operate in those conditions. By working with Alaska Airlines and Boeing, British Airways technical pilots were able to demonstrate that a hybrid concept was feasible, and although British Airways never eventually bought the regional jet, this was the breakthrough needed for international approval for such systems which meant that they could reach a global market. The wheel turned full circle in December 2006 when London Heathrow was affected for a long period by dense fog. This airport was operating at maximum capacity in good conditions, and the imposition of low visibility procedures required to protect the localiser signal for autoland systems meant a major reduction in capacity from approximately 60 to 30 landings per hour. Since most airlines operating into Heathrow already had autoland-equipped aircraft, and thus expected to operate as normal, massive delays occurred. The worst affected airline was of course British Airways, as the largest operator at the airport. =Emergency autoland= Garmin Aviation started studying an emergency autoland feature in 2001 and launched the program in 2010 with more than 100 employees, investing around $20 million. Flight tests began in 2014 with 329 test landings completed in a Cessna 400 Corvalis and another 300 landings in other aircraft. The feature is activated by a guarded red button on Garmin G3000 avionics, evaluating winds, weather and fuel reserves to select a suitable diversion airport and taking over the aircraft controls to land, it advises the ATC and displays instructions to occupants. A Piper M600 single-engine turboprop began flight tests in early 2018 and completed more than 170 landings to seek pending FAA certification. Providing access to more than 9,000 runways over , it is offered from 2020 for $170,000 including extra equipment. It will also be certified for the single-engine Cirrus Vision SF50 jet from 2020, landing on runways over , and eventually be offered on the SOCATA-Daher TBM 900 and others. Systems A typical autoland system consists of an ILS (integrated glideslope receiver, localizer receiver, and perhaps GPS receiver as well) radio to receive the localizer and glideslope signals. The output of this radio will be a deviation from center which is provided to the flight control computer; this computer which controls the aircraft control surfaces to maintain the aircraft centered on the localizer and glideslope. The flight control computer also controls the aircraft throttles to maintain the appropriate approach speed. At the appropriate height above the ground (as indicated by the radio altimeter) the flight control computer will retard the throttles and initiate a pitch-up maneuver. The purpose of this \\"flare\\" is to reduce the energy of the aircraft such that it stops flying and settles onto the runway. For CAT IIIc, the flight control computer will continue to accept deviations from the localizer and use the rudder to maintain the aircraft on the localizer (which is aligned with the runway centerline.) On landing the spoilers will deploy (these are surfaces on the top of the wing towards the trailing edge) which causes airflow over the wing to become turbulent, destroying lift. At the same time the autobrake system will apply the brakes. The anti-skid system will modulate brake pressure to keep all wheels turning. As the speed decreases, the rudder will lose effectiveness and the pilot will need to control the direction of the airplane using nose wheel steering, a system which typically is not connected to the flight control computer. From an avionics safety perspective, a CAT IIIc landing is the worst-case scenario for safety analysis because a failure of the automatic systems from flare through the roll-out could easily result in a \\"hard over\\" (where a control surface deflects fully in one direction.) This would happen so fast that the flight crew may not effectively respond. For this reason autoland systems are designed to incorporate a high degree of redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active) and a second failure can be detected ‚Äì at which point the autoland system will turn itself off (uncouple, fail passive). One way of accomplishing this is to have \\"three of everything.\\" Three ILS receivers, three radio altimeters, three flight control computers, and three ways of controlling the flight surfaces. The three flight control computers all work in parallel and are in constant cross communications, comparing their inputs (ILS receivers and radio altimeters) with those of the other two flight control computers. If there is a difference in inputs, then a computer can \\"vote out\\" the deviant input and will notify the other computers that \\"RA1 is faulty.\\" If the outputs don't match, a computer can declare itself as faulty and, if possible, take itself off line. When the pilot arms the system (prior to capture of either the localizer or glideslope) the flight control computers perform an extensive series of built In tests. For a CAT III landing, all the sensors and all the flight computers must be in good health before the pilot receives an \\"AUTOLAND ARM\\" indication (generic indications that will vary depending on equipment supplier and aircraft manufacturer). If part of the system is in error, then an indication such as \\"APPROACH ONLY\\" would be presented to inform the flight crew that a CAT III landing is not possible. If the system is properly in the ARM mode, when the ILS receiver detects the localizer, then the autoland system mode will change to \\"LOCALIZER CAPTURE\\" and the flight control computer will turn the aircraft into the localizer and fly along the localizer. A typical approach will have the aircraft come in \\"below the glideslope\\" (vertical guidance) so the airplane will fly along the localizer (aligned to the runway centerline) until the glideslope is detected at which point the autoland mode will change to CAT III and the aircraft will be flown by the flight control computer along the localizer and glideslope beams. The antennas for these systems are not at the runway touch down point however, with the localizer being some distance beyond the runway. However at a predefined distance above the ground the aircraft will initiate the flare maneuver, maintain the same heading, and settle onto the runway within the designated touch down zone. If the autoland system loses redundancy prior to the decision height, then an \\"AUTOLAND FAULT\\" error message will be displayed to the flight crew at which point the crew can elect to continue as a CAT II approach or if this is not possible because of weather conditions, then the crew would need to initiate a go-around and proceed to an alternative airport. If a single failure occurs below decision height, \\"AUTOLAND FAULT\\" will be displayed; however, at that point the aircraft is committed to landing and the autoland system will remain engaged, controlling the aircraft on only two systems until the pilot completes the rollout and brings the aircraft to a full stop on the runway or turns off the runway onto a taxiway. This is termed \\"fail-active.\\" However, in this state the autoland system is \\"one fault away\\" from disengaging so the \\"AUTOLAND FAULT\\" indication should inform the flight crew to monitor the system behavior very carefully and be ready to take control immediately. The system is still fail-active and is still performing all necessary cross-checks so that if one of the flight control computers decides that the right thing to do is order a full deflection of a control surface, the other computer will detect that there is a difference in the commands and this will take both computers off line (fail-passive) at which time the flight crew must immediately take control of the aircraft as the automatic systems have done the safe thing by taking themselves off line. During system design, the predicted reliability numbers for the individual equipment which makes up the entire autoland system (sensors, computers, controls, and so forth) are combined and an overall probability of failure is calculated. As the threat exists primarily during the flare through roll-out, this exposure time is used and the overall failure probability must be less than one in a million.(this number comes from FAA Advisory Circular AC 25.1309-1A for systems which have a Catastrophic Failure) See alsoLAAS *Instrument landing system *Head-up display *Fog References  External links  BOAC VC10 Automatic Landing 1968 * Canberra automatic landing at RAE Bedford, 1958 *Trident Autolanding a 1969 Flight article on the Hawker Siddeley Trident's autoland system *Automatic Landing a 1969 Flight article on the differing philosophies regarding autoland requirements *\\"All-Weather Landings\\" a 1953 Flight article about the BLEU *\\"Smiths Autoland System\\" 1 1965 Flight advertisement for the system Aircraft landing systems ","title":"Autoland"},{"id":"1841063","text":"The Official Secrets Act 1923 is India's anti-espionage act held over from the British colonial period.

At various times in history they have also been termed yunbian (‰∫ëÊâÅ) and yunyaozi (‰∫ëÁ™ëÂ≠ê). Though technically Yunzi refers only to sintered stones made of \\"yunzi\\" material (the exact composition is a secret), the term can also sometimes connote stones which are single-convex of any material. Yunzi-style stones made of jade for instance, were often presented to the reigning emperor and his court in ancient China. Appearance Yunzi are delicately made with a green luster yet are neither brittle nor slippery. The black and white pieces each have unique individual qualities. Old style white pieces are opaque with a tint of yellow or green. The black pieces are dark, and when held to the light have a translucent green hue.Yellow Mountain Imports Newer yunzi, however, have pure white stones.Old Yunzi Single Convex Go Stones and Straw Bowls: pYN-SD001-A Yellow Mountain Imports (archive.org copy from 2008, original link unavailable)  History  Double convex yunzi stones and woven baskets The production of yunzi started in the Tang dynasty and reached its peak in the Ming and Qing dynasties; the total verifiable history of yunzi spans at least five hundred years. Among yunzi, most famous was the yongzi (Ê∞∏Â≠ê) manufactured by Yongchang Fu (Ê∞∏ÊòåÂ∫ú, today the city of Baoshan, Yunnan) during the Ming dynasty. It was said that after a fire broke out in an imperial treasury, one of the keepers, who was from Yongchang Fu, discovered that melted pearls and jade had a special luster. When he returned to his hometown, he fashioned yunzi out of the agate and amber for which Yongchang Fu was famous. These yunzi went on to be prized by the literati and were offered to the Emperor. Yunzi also appeared frequently in Chinese literature as the subject of a number of verses penned over the years, being mentioned in works such as Ming Yi Tong Zhi (Ming Dynasty Comprehensive Geographic Survey) and Travels of Xu Xiake, both of which favored the yongzi. Today in Baoshan there are still people who have antiques dating from the Ming dynasty; among those there remain one and a half original yongzi sets. The yunzi have also been presented to international dignitaries including Queen Elizabeth II.Yunnan China The traditional art of making yunzi was lost during the first few years of the 20th century because of war in the region. In 1964, General Chen Yi examined the situation of yunzi while inspecting Yunnan. Zhou Enlai also inquired about the possible reproduction of yunzi. The Yunnan Sports Commission investigated the Yunzi manufacturing processes and rediscovered the art by reverse engineering a few original Yunzi. In 1974, the state-run Yunnan Weiqi Factory began manufacturing yunzi stones.http://www.mzyq.cn/yunzi/main/english.asp They are used in professional weiqi tournaments in China and elsewhere. According to Chinese law, the yunzi stones can only be produced by the state run Yunzi company. The company creates the yunzi in an old factory that was used by the American Flying Tigers as barracks during World War II. The formula is thought to be ground Yunnan mountain stones and agate.  Caring for yunzi  Like other types of Go stones, yunzi are washed and dried using a gentle soap solution to remove any dust from the packaging/manufacturing process. Although a light coat of oil, wiped clean, will help yunzi stones appear at their best, care must be taken in oiling yunzi. Because vegetable oils, such as olive or canola oil, will oxidise and become rancid over time, they should not be applied to yunzi to avoid developing an unpleasant odor. Instead, common practice is to use an unscented mineral oil to oil yunzi; alternatively, stones may be washed but remain unoiled; over time, the natural oils incurred by human touch will polish yunzi to a sheen. Like glass Go stones, yunzi are very durable. However, like glass stones, yunzi are still at risk for chipping if they are dropped or otherwise come into sharp contact with hard surfaces such as metal, tile, or stone.

Geography It flows into the Sea of Okhotsk near the small town Chumikan. It rises south of the eastern Stanovoy Mountains and flows east, receiving tributaries from the Stanovoys. It borders the northern side of the Dzhagdy Range. At the eastern end of the Stanovoys it receives a river \\"Maya\\" (not the other Maya) from the high country to the northwest and flows about into Uda Gulf at the southwest corner of the Sea of Okhotsk near the Shantar Islands. History From the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) to the Treaty of Aigun (1858) its lower course was officially part of the border between Russia and China, although the border was not clearly marked and the area rarely visited. Some of Ivan Moskvitin's men reached the Uda in 1640. The local Lamuts told them of the rivers Zeya and the Amur but would not guide them inland. In 1684 some Cossacks fled from the Manchus on the Zeya, reached Udsk, and went up the Maya to Yakutsk. Udsk Ostrog (fort) was founded in 1679,John J Stephen, \\"The Russian Far East\\",1994,age 27 or 1659 Robert J Kerner, \\"The Urge to the Sea\\", 1942,page 80 on the left bank of the river upstream. There were suggestions to move Okhotsk south to Udsk but this was rejected because of the poor harbor and the proximity of the Chinese border. There were generally about 10 peasant families around the fort trying to produce grain and a few thin cattle, but results were poor. Sometimes seed corn had to be imported. A pood of rye flour that cost half a ruble at Irkutsk cost 8 to 10 rubles at Udsk. The population was 30 in 1690, 200 in 1800 and 164 in 1865. Yakutsk-Udsk Track: This was an ill-defined route used to supply Udsk from Yakutsk. It was open from April to October but there was some winter travel. Its length was estimated at . It crossed the Amga River at Amginsk, the Aldan River at Kompaneisk and the Uchur River at Uchur Crossing. Pack horses were usually left at Udsk as food for sled dogs or people while the Yakut drivers returned to Yakutsk on foot or skis. In 1750 all the pack horses perished in deep snow resulting in starvation. In 1788 more than 100 horses drowned during the spring snowmelt.James R Gipson, \\"Feeding the Russian Fur Trade\\",1969  Notes  Rivers of Khabarovsk Krai Drainage basins of the Sea of Okhotsk ","title":"Uda (Khabarovsk Krai)"},{"id":"1841081","text":"The Uda ( ; ) is a river in the Buryat Republic, Russia.

Broadnax (December 28, 1916 ‚Äì June 1, 1992), also known as \\"Wilbur\\", \\"Willie\\", and \\"Wilmer\\", was an American hard gospel quartet singer during the golden age of traditional black gospel. His most common nickname was \\"Little Axe,\\" due to both his small stature and his brother William \\"Big Axe\\" Broadnax, who was a popular baritone. Early life Broadnax was born in Houston, Texas in 1916, to William Broadnax and Gussie Frazier. By 1930 he lived with his step-father Augustus Flowers, mother Gussie Frazier, younger brother William Broadnax, and younger step-sister Armatha Broadnax in Houston. Broadnax was assigned female at birth, a fact which was only discovered upon his death and leads to confusion surrounding his early life. Although Willmer was the oldest of the three Broadnax children, most sources state that Willmer was the younger of the two brothers . As Armatha Broadnax is unmentioned after the 1930 census, it is possible Armatha took on Willmer's name after his death and truly was William's younger sibling. This would mean that Willmer Broadnax as known today was born in 1922 in Louisiana to Augustus Flowers and Gussie Frazier. It is also possible that Willmer was in fact the older brother and had already started using male pronouns by age thirteen, and that later he was mistaken as the younger brother because of his high voice and short stature. Career Broadnax began his career as a gospel singer during his teenage years with his brother William as a member of the St. Paul Gospel Singers in Houston in the 1930s. The two brothers moved to Los Angeles and joined Southern Gospel Singers, of which Willmer was a member of from 1939-1940; the group only performed on weekends and did not tour. The brothers eventually broke off to form their own quartet, Little Axe and the Golden Echoes. Although William eventually left for Atlanta, where he joined the Five Trumpets, Willmer stayed on as lead singer throughout the 1940s. In 1949 the group, augmented by future member of The Soul Stirrers Paul Foster (singer), recorded a single of \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\" for Specialty Records. Label chief Art Rupe decided to drop them before they could record a follow- up, and shortly thereafter the Golden Echoes disbanded. Pianist Willie Love said during this period that, \\"Little Axe couldn‚Äôt sing low, because he had a relatively high voice. It wasn‚Äôt falsetto, it was naturally high. So somebody had to sing the bottom.\\" His point is clear in the recordings of the Golden Echoes, where Paul Foster's rich baritone and Broadnax's clear tenor riff off each other to create the illusion of a multi-octave lead singer. As music critic Ray Funk points out, \\"Little Axe‚Äôs lead is absolutely distinctive on these cuts. He is the high lead that takes over from the baritone of Paul Foster. His voice is sweet but almost vicious, dripping with emotion, while Foster, in contrast, would offer almost a growl.\\" In 1950, Broadnax joined the Spirit of Memphis Quartet. Along with Broadnax, the group featured two other leads ‚Äì Jethro \\"Jet\\" Bledsoe, a bluesy crooner, and Silas Steele, an overpowering baritone. The Spirit of Memphis Quartet recorded for King Records, and Broadnax appeared on their releases at least until 1952. Shortly after that, Broadnax moved on, working with The Fairfield Four, and in the early 1960s as one of the replacements for Archie Brownlee in the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. Until 1965 Wilmer headed a quartet called \\"Little Axe and the Golden Echoes,\\" which released some singles on Peacock Records. By then, quartet singing was fading in commercial viability, and Broadnax retired from touring. In retirement, Broadnax continued to record new material occasionally with the Blind Boys into the 1970s and 1980s. Later years and death Broadnax was killed in 1992 by his lover Lavina Richardson (age 42 at the time), who was later found guilty of involuntary manslaughter on February 4, 1993. Leading up to the stabbing, Broadnax had allegedly been jealous of Richardson. Broadnax saw Richardson in a vehicle with another man, bumped his car into theirs, and dragged Richardson out. He then threatened her with a knife before he was disarmed by a bystander, whereupon Richardson picked up his knife and stabbed him three times. Broadnax died from his injuries several days later on June 1, 1992. Upon Broadnax's death in 1992, it was discovered that Broadnax was a trans man. This created a stir in the gospel community, with many prominent singers at the time insisting that they had suspected all along that his gender assigned at birth was female, including JoJo Wallace of the Sensational Nightingales who said, \\"I always wondered about Axe.\\" However, it is more likely that only his brother William \\"Big Axe\\" Broadnax and other close family members knew about his gender identity. The intersection of Broadnax's gender and race created some issues for him on tour as public bathrooms were segregated. It was not uncommon for many gospel singers to be unable to use public restrooms where they performed. Broadnax was forced to keep his gender identity a secret by using the restroom alone, which also provoked from retrospective suspicion by Claude Jeter who said, \\"Ax‚Äôd always go off by himself.\\" Legacy On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Little Axe and the Golden Echoes among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

Established in 1948, Sciences Po Bordeaux is one of the ten Institutes of Political Studies of France and a Grandes √©cole. All students in Sciences Po Bordeaux study a curriculum that is highly practical and broad based, focusing on the full range of the social sciences: law, economics, finance, management, etc. The school is considered as one of the most selective in France, mainly because it is one of the schools where main political and business leaders are born. According to article 2 of an 18 December 1989 decree, the mission of Institutes of Political Studies is : 1¬∞ to contribute to the training of higher civil servants as well as executives in the public, para-public and private sectors, notably in the State and decentralized communities 2¬∞ to develop the research in political and administrative sciences Alumni include many notable public figures, including one French Prime Minister, politicians and influential businessmen. The Institute has approximately 1,300 students, admitted after a rigorous selection. Each year, Sciences Po Bordeaux receives about 3000 applications and only around 150 students will be accepted after the selection process, around 5% in average. This process makes it one of the most difficult French Political Institute to be accepted in. The academic course lasts five years, at the end of which a student graduates with the Diploma of Sciences Po Bordeaux (which is equivalent to a bachelor's degree) and with one of three Masters offered by the Institute. Sciences Po Bordeaux is a well integrated university, with more than 200 exchange-agreements with foreign universities around the world. It also proposes double degree programs with the universities of Stuttgart (Germany), Turin (Italy), Coimbra (Portugal), Madrid (Spain), Cardiff (UK), Moscow (Russia), Kingston (Jamaica) and Quebec (Canada). History The school was established by decree on the 4th of May 1948 under the name \\"Institut d'√©tudes politiques de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Bordeaux\\". Maurice Duverger was its first director. It obtained the status of public establishment and got its present name by decree on the 18th of January 1969 with the other Sciences-Po of Aix, Grenoble, Lyon, Strasbourg and Toulouse. The historian and sociologist Jacques Ellul, as well as the future Minister, Secretary of the European Council and Vice-President of the European Parliament, Catherine Lalumi√®re, were teachers in the institution. Until 1967, Sciences-Po Bordeaux was located in the city center of Bordeaux, before being replaced by the current lower Court of Justice of Bordeaux. By a decree in 1989, Sciences-Po Bordeaux has been attached to the University of Bordeaux IV. Sciences-Po Bordeaux is a member of the PRES of the University of Bordeaux. Since September 2016, Yves D√©loye is the director of the school. =Directors= Maurice Duverger * Marcel Merle * 1967‚Äì1977 : Albert Mabileau * 1977‚Äì1985 : Claude Emery * 1985‚Äì1998 : Pierre Sadran * 1998‚Äì2007 : Robert Lafore * 2007‚Äì2016 : Vincent Hoffmann-Martinot * Since 2016 : Yves D√©loye  Education  The academic course, which lasted three years until 2002, was extended to five years following the European model of the \\"LMD\\". The year 2005 marked the last phase of the reform. The second year of the course is a mandatory year of mobility in France or abroad. = Admission = Entry to Sciences Po Bordeaux is conditioned by selection tests, either at the level of baccalaur√©at (Bac 0), Bac + 1 (integrated courses) Bac + 3 or master. The selection rate in 2013 for the Bac 0 tests was 6.70%. * For admission in first year the tests are as follow:  History essay  A dissertation on contemporary knowledge  Language test * For admission in third year to Bac + 3:  A dissertation on contemporary knowledge;  Language test;  A speciality test to choose between: private law, public law, economics, geography, history, foreign civilization, sociology. The online registration dates for the events are usually between January and February of each academic year, the entrance exams take place between April and May. * For admission to the first year, the integrated courses: six of them, are the result of a partnership with a foreign university. Students are sent abroad two out of the 5 years (United Kingdom, Spain, Morocco, Germany, Italy and Portugal). The entry exams consist of a composition essay on a current theme, and a test of living language (English for Morocco). Candidates who are eligible to take part in the written tests must take an oral examination. By 2015, the intake rate for integrated sectors was around 10%. = Social diversification = Since 2006, with the support of the Regional Council of Aquitaine, the Rectorate of the Academy of Bordeaux and the ACSE, the Institute has set up a social diversification program through an integrated preparation system in 24 secondary schools in the region of Aquitaine in order to promote access to the establishment of pupils from less favored social categories. This program, entitled \\"Sciences Po Bordeaux, I Can Because I Want It!\\" 1,183 high school students in Aquitaine benefited from this program between 2006 and 2013, 965 has been admitted to the entrance tests and 103 were admitted. Because of this initiative, 30% of its students has received a scholarship of Tertiary Education, highest rate among the 9 Institutes of Political Studies in France. = The First Cycle: The Bachelor of Political Studies = The first cycle is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in political studies. The objective of the first cycle is to expose students to disciplines in which they are based on (law, political science, history, economics, international relations, sociology, geography), the acquisition of working methods of Sciences Po and the strengthening two foreign languages besides French. Each year consists of 60 ECTS credits: The first year is a year of initial training and acquisition of working methods The second year consists of a year of compulsory exchange, in the form of a year of study or an internship. Sciences Po Bordeaux has more than 250 academic partner universities in Europe and the rest of the world. Students are also allowed to pursue their studies in France, in a different institution. The third year is a year of consolidation and orientation to the master's degree. = The Second Cycle: Diploma of the Institute of Political studies = The Diploma of the Institute of Political Studies is equivalent to a master's degree. The second cycle consists of two years with 60 ETCS per year. Students are required to choose their master, in other word, their specialisation. During the two years of master, at least one semester is devoted to an internship, which normally lasts for 6 months to prepare students for their future career. For masters which are research based, an in depth dissertation which lasts for at least 6 months will be required instead of an internship. There are 4 majors in Sciences Po Bordeaux for the master's degrees and each major consists of different master's degrees as follow:  Major in Public Administration and Management  Master of Public Administration Master of Expertise in Public Affairs  Major in International Affairs  Master of Applied Geoeconomics Master of International Cooperation and Development Master of Risk Management in Southern Countries Master of European Integration and Global Development (in partnership with the University of Moscow) Master of Politics and Development in Africa and the Countries of the South Master of International Relations (Also Known as the Bordeaux International Relations Degree which is in English) Master of International Policy Master of Interdisciplinary and Inter- University Joint Dynamics of the Afriques (with the University of Bordeaux)  Major in Politics, Society and Communication  Master of European Affairs Master of Public Affairs and Interest Representation Master of Journalism Master of Public Communication and Policy Master of Policy Professions Master of Society, Powers and Representations Master of Metropolitan strategies and governance  Major in Management of Projects and Organizations  Master of Management of Enterprises and Organizations Master of Development of Enterprises of the Social and Solidarity Economy Master of Management of Cultural Projects and Territorial Development = Double Degrees = Sciences Po Bordeaux has set up double degrees with its partners around the globe.

This doctoral school is in cooperation with School of Sciences Sociales: Society, Health and Decision from the University of Bordeaux and the previous doctoral school of Political Science from University of Bordeaux and Institut d'Etudes Politiques, Bordeaux. This school offers doctorates in: * Political science * Sociology = Other courses offered at Sciences Po Bordeaux =  The preparation of the French Administrative Examination  In accordance with its original objective, the IEP contributes to the training of public service executives, both through initial training and through preparations for administrative examinations. There are three specific preparations available for initial training (after the diploma, a bachelor's degree or a master's degree) or in continuing education (employees, civil servants)/ * The General Administration Preparation Center (CPAG) for category A civil service recruitment examination; These examinations included the National School of Administration, the National Institute of Territorial Studies (INET) and the School of Higher Studies in Public Health (EHESP); * The preparation for the aggregation and CAPES of economics and social sciences.  Continuing education  IEP has developed a range of continuing education courses for elected officials, executives of public, parapublic and voluntary organizations as well as corporate executives. These included short courses (1 day) or certifying courses (15 days). These courses are specialised in IEP's areas of expertise: management, international affairs, territorial governance, social action, communication and management. The courses are taught by IEP professors and qualified external speakers regarding to the subjects.  Summer thematic School  In order to diversify its training offer, Bordeaux Political Institute has for several years embarked on a policy of developing a summer thematic schools . These training modules are broadly open to societal issues (in the field of international relations as well as defense and internal political or administrative transformations). They also aim to enhance the social science research produced in the two research units : the Center √âmile Durkheim and Les Afriques dans le monde (LAM). In the recent past, these thematic schools have also strengthened a number of institutional partnerships, notably with the French Association of Political Science, the CNRS or the University of Laval. As a privileged partner of the University of Bordeaux for several years, University of Laval is particularly concerned by two recurrent training modules: the School of International Relations (Hautes √âtudes Internationales / Sciences Po Bordeaux) on \\"The spirit of democracy\\" (Department of Political Science, University of Laval/ Sciences Po Bordeaux / Free University of Brussels). As such, these two programs are organized alternately in Bordeaux and in the partner institutions. This training program, funded in part by Sciences Po Bordeaux, also benefits from the regular support of the IdEx Bordeaux International Summer Schools program, the CNRS Thematic Schools Program and the International Cooperation Fund of the Region new Aquitaine.  Campus  Before 1967, Sciences Po Bordeaux was based in Bordeaux itself, at No. 4 Rue du Mar√©chal-Joffre, the present seat of the Court of First Instance of Bordeaux. Since then, it has been located on the University Estate of Talence-Pessac-Gradignan. From June 2013 to April 2015, the Bordeaux Institute of Political Studies began a complete restructuring of its premises. A total investment of 26 million euros is allocated to this project with 25 million by the Regional Council of Aquitaine and 1 million by the city of Pessac. This work increases the capacity of the school from 1850 to 3000 students and the total area of the building from 8 400 m2 to 15 200 m2 . Four new lecture halls were named after Jacques Ellul, √âtienne de La Bo√©tie, Ali√©nor d'Aquitaine and Simone Veil.  Student's life  Sciences Po Bordeaux benefits of a vibrant student life. As in 2013, 34 student socialise were registered by the school. 4 main associations are responsible for the campus life : a student office (BDE) (events, integration camps, graduation ceremony...), Art Association (BDA) (theatre, dance, music, cinema, photography), Erasmix (Erasmus Association) and Sport Association (AS). Other societies: a Campus Radio, Podcasts, a wine casting club, entrepreneurship association, newspapers, political groups, cultural exchange clubs, student unions, Think tanks....  Alumni  A large number of former students have pursued a successful career in politics, senior civil service, media, scientific research or business in France and around the world.

He committed to the University of Arizona, but reneged by making himself eligible for the NBA Draft. Ebi was selected out of Westbury Christian School by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round (26th pick overall) of the 2003 NBA draft. Ebi was raised in Nigeria before moving to Houston, Texas as a teenager to attend high school. He holds both British and Nigerian citizenship. Ebi is also a movie producer. Professional career Ebi was the first first-round pick in three years for the Wolves; the team had forfeited five first-round picks after the team owner illegally made a deal with forward Joe Smith (the penalty was later reduced to three picks). After Ebi appeared in 19 games over the course of two seasons, Minnesota attempted to get an exception from the NBA so they could send him to the NBA Development League. Ebi was technically ineligible as the 2005‚Äì06 NBA season was his third year, and the D-League only accepted players who had been in the NBA for less than two years. Minnesota wanted to guide Ebi in, and they tacitly argued that Ebi was hardly a two-year veteran in the figurative sense, given his limited playing time. The league rejected Minnesota's request regarding Ebi, and to make room for Ronald Dupree, Minnesota released Ebi on 1 November 2005. Ebi signed a free agent contract over the summer of 2006 with the Dallas Mavericks. After playing five pre-season games, averaging 5.2 points per game (ppg), Ebi was waived by the Mavericks on 26 October 2006.

Etymology The word aeni comes from the English word \\"animation\\" as written in Hangeul, Ïï†ÎãàÎ©îÏù¥ÏÖò (aenimeisyeon), similar to Japanese „Ç¢„Éã„É°„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ (animƒìshon). Just like anime, aenimeisyeon was shorten to aeni. However, aeni usually refers to Japanese animation in colloquial usage, although it can refer to Korean animation or animation in general. To distinguish it from its Japanese counterpart, Korean animation is often called hanguk aeni (; lit. Korean animation) or guksan aeni (; lit. domestic animation). A Sino-Korean term manhwa yeonghwa (; Hanja: Êº´Áï´Êò†Áï´), a portmanteau of manhwa and the Korean term for movie, is also used as a general term for all animation. History Larva in the Lotte World II Hotel The South Korean animation industry was in a period of crisis throughout the 2000s. Depression at the reality of being an industry that the West merely gave factory-type drawing to began to sink in. This followed the 1990s, a period of explosive growth for the industry when Korean studios made most of their profits from OEM, mostly from the United States. In many ways, 2011 was a bright transitional year for Korean animation, with home-produced animated feature films finally finding box office success in South Korea, instead of facing the usual financial failure. As far as overseas export market is concerned, the likes of Rough Draft Korea (RDK) kept on landing new contracts, which have seen Rough Draft perform the manual work on over 45 popular Western cartoon titles over 16 years. South Korean animation has boomed in popularity in Eastern Asia with the success of the series Pororo the Little Penguin and Origami Warriors in 2011, leaving fans wanting to discover more Korean animations. This success is due in part to perfecting the Korean animation technique, and financial returns being reinvested into new animated products. Some Korean animators still blame the booming Korean game industry for draining the animation industry's talent pool, but the box office success of the Korean animated film Leafie in 2011 in South Korea is inspiring a new generation. Animation industry Animation contracts for Korean animation studios range from collaboration/minor contribution contracts, to most of the work. The South Korean animation industry can be considered dynamic as there are more than a hundred animation studios. While it is mostly firms in South Korea that contract with Western studios, some of the work is reported to be subcontracted to North Korea as well. =Korean animation characters in public spaces= Tayo bus 'Rudolph' *Larva subway was a subway based on and featured a Larva character. It operated from November 2014 until May 2015 on line No. 2. The Seoul government and Metro explained that they wanted to give citizens a chance to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the subways opening. *Tayo buses were organized by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Bus Transport Business Association, and the animation company which made Tayo the Little Bus for the Public Transportation Day. In 2014, the Seoul Metropolitan Government commissioned buses designed as the characters of Tayo the Little Bus to go around the Gwanghwamun Square area of the city. *In 2014, statues of Larva and Pororo the Little Penguin were installed in World Park, which is a square in the Lotte World II Hotel. They were well received by citizens and tourist. Market In 2010, according to the Korea Creative Content Agency, the Korean market share of domestic characters was about 28% and the remaining 72% was for foreign characters, such as those from Japan and USA. In 2012, experts predicted that the total market size would grow to 10 trillion won (about 9 billion dollars in July 2018) in the near future . In 2014, the domestic character market share soared to 40% and its value in 2013 had reached 8 trillion won (about 7 billion dollars). = Korean characters as international business = Before the emergence of Korean domestic characters, characters that enjoyed popularity were mostly from the United States and Japan. However, as the industry matured and grew in size, domestic characters received preference not just domestically but also internationally.

It was introduced in November 2004 by Phanfare, Inc, a company founded by Andrew Erlichson and Mark Heinrich. Overview Phanfare was targeted at prosumers and serious amateurs who desire archival photo and video sharing. Consumers could upload their digital photos and videos to Phanfare. Phanfare provided each customer with a destination URL where they could direct viewers. Phanfare integrated address book and invitation tools to allow the consumer to efficiently send out invitations to view albums. It backed up and held original fullsize images using Amazon S3, allowing the consumer to retrieve their original digital assets in the event that they lose their local copy. Phanfare was acquired by Carbonite on June 6, 2011. Uploading of photos and videos Phanfare distributed a photo and video organizing program called Phanfare Photo (Windows and Mac compatible) that uploaded photos and video in the background while the consumer adds captions, edits and organizes the content. Phanfare could import JPEG, Adobe Photoshop PSD images as well as AVI, QuickTime, WMV and MPEG-2 movies. Phanfare also provided an Apple iPhone app, Phanfare Photon, for uploading and viewing photos and videos as well as plugins for major photo and video organizing programs. Phanfare has been noted by the Wall Street Journal for its novel approach to video sharing and its media retention policies. The ideas for cache-coherent synchronization of photos and videos to a local application cache can be traced back to work in Cache Coherence in shared memory Multiprocessing. History of Phanfare First released in November 2004, Phanfare initially provided simple web hosting of photos and videos at short URLs in the Phanfare domain. Phanfare provided viewing and sharing without requiring that viewers register with Phanfare. Phanfare sites were optionally protected with site passwords. In January 2008, Phanfare introduced social networking features to the Phanfare system, de-emphasized the desktop clients, and began offering a freemium level of service (initially 1GB free, and later reduced to 256MB free) which lasted until 2009, as well as printed products including silver halide prints, digitally printed books and cards. On June 6, 2011, Carbonite acquired Phanfare. Carbonite declined to honor Phanfare lifetime memberships, instead granted lifetime members $299 in Phanfare credit which would expire after three years if unused. Two days later, Phanfare founder and CEO, Andrew Erlichson notified lifetime subscribers that customers requesting a refund will be paid not by Carbonite, but what remains of Phanfare, Inc. In May 2012, Erlichson left Carbonite exactly one year after the purchase. Carbonite shut down Phanfare on May 28, 2017.

He studied history at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, receiving his license and Ma√Ætrise (Master's) degrees. While researching the history of racial prejudice against Africa by its colonisers for his Ma√Ætrise, Kabor√© was drawn to contemporary documentary films which, he felt, continued to propagate such stereotypes. To better understand the \\"language of cinema\\", he decided to go to ESEC film school. Originally intending to use film as a medium for disseminating historical knowledge, he gradually grew passionate about film for its own sake. He received his degree in Film Production in 1976. He returned to his native country to be director of the Centre National du Cin√©ma. His film Wend Kuuni was only the second feature film produced in Burkina Faso. His work for the screen, focusing on his country‚Äôs rural heritage, has received numerous international awards, including a French C√©sar award. In 1997 he won the first prize at the 15th Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) with the film Buud Yam. From 1985 to 1997 he was the Secretary-General of the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI).

WINS' studios are located in the combined Entercom facility in the Hudson Square neighborhood in lower Manhattan, and its transmitter is located in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. WINS is the oldest continuously operating all-news station in the United States, having adopted the format on April 19, 1965 under former owner Westinghouse Broadcasting, and is one of two all-news stations in the New York City market owned by Entercom, with WCBS (880 AM) being the other.

That same year, effective January 15, it adopted its present call sign, named after Hearst's International News Service.\\"Hearst buys WGBS, plans improvement.\\" Broadcasting, October 15, 1931, pg. 12.

WINS changed its frequency from 1180 kHz to 1000 kHz on March 29, 1941 as part of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), and moved again to 1010 kHz in 1944.

Keiter is perhaps best remembered for his recreations of San Francisco (formerly New York) Giants baseball games, which WINS carried in 1958 to keep disconnected Giant fans in touch with their team. The Giants had moved west along with the Brooklyn Dodgers the previous year. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, as the transistor radio became popular, especially with young people who could carry radios with them everywhere, rock and roll solidified as a genre, thanks in large measure to what became known as Top 40 radio. In New York, four stations battled in the  WMCA (570 AM), WMGM (1050 AM), WABC (770 AM), and WINS. While WMCA was only 5,000 watts, it was at the bottom end of the dial, which gave it better coverage than might be expected for its power; the other three were all 50,000 watts, but only WABC was both non-directional and a clear channel station. Of those three, WINS was the most directional (aimed straight at New York's inner boroughs), with a weaker signal than the others toward the New Jersey suburbs and the Jersey Shore. In 1962, WMGM adopted a beautiful music format under its previous call letters, WHN, while WINS was purchased by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation.\\"Westinghouse buying WINS\\". Broadcasting, May 7, 1962, pg. 72. Retrieved August 26, 2018. WMCA enjoyed some early success after WINS and WMGM left the Top 40 format, but WABC became the dominant Top 40 station in New York City by 1965. On April 18, 1965, around 8:00 pm, WINS bowed out of Top 40 competition with the song \\"Out in the Streets\\", by The Shangri-Las.\\"30 Years Of Wins' 22-minute World\\", New York Daily News. April 18, 1995. Retrieved August 26, 2018. =\\"All news. All the time.\\" (1965‚Äìpresent)= On April 19, 1965, after weeks of speculation, WINS changed its format radically. It became the third radio station in the United States to attempt all-news programming, going with the new format around the clock. WINS immediately established a template for its format with an easily identifiable, distinctive teletype sound effect playing in the background. Most other all-news stations later dropped this, but WINS continues to use it to this day despite teletype machines becoming obsolete by the mid-1980s. WINS used memorable slogans such as \\"All news, all the time\\"; \\"The newswatch never stops\\"; \\"Listen two, three, four times a day\\"; and \\"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world\\"; the latter tagline was a reference to WINS's format clock, which returns to the top stories every twenty minutes. WINS's switch to all-news was initially viewed as a risky programming choice. Tijuana, Mexico- based border blaster XETRA had programmed an English-language all-news format for the Los Angeles radio market, as had Chicago station WNUS and, previously WAVA AM and FM in the Washington, D.C. area. Locally, WABC-FM aired a news format for several weeks during the 1962‚Äì63 New York City newspaper strike. None of the other attempts were successful, and as a result many in the radio industry predicted a quick demise for WINS, however, Westinghouse Broadcasting supported the format and WINS eventually prospered with it. Westinghouse made similar format changes at two other stations: KYW in Philadelphia, in September 1965; and KFWB in Los Angeles, in March 1968. Together, WINS, KFWB and KYW served as prototype all-news stations, and all three succeeded in attracting both listeners and advertising revenue over the years. In 1995, Westinghouse Electric purchased CBS, a move which put WINS under common ownership with WCBS. Despite initial speculation after the merger that either station would drop the all-news format, both stations remained in place and are among the most successful radio operations in the U.S. in terms of advertising sales. The two stations have their own areas of dominance; WINS's ratings numbers are better within New York City, while WCBS's listener strength is greater in the suburbs, owing primarily to its much stronger signal. From a programming standpoint, they have different styles (hard news, vs. lighter and conversational) to appeal to different listeners. Since the Westinghouse-CBS merger, both stations have continued to perform well in both ratings and advertising revenue. WINS's signal was also improved in 1995 after the company bought KSYG in Little Rock, Arkansas, which had also broadcast on the same frequency, and took it off the air. This relieved WINS of the need to \\"null\\" its signal in the direction of Little Rock. WINS' towers in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, which were shorter than optimum for its frequency, were replaced with four taller ones. While the signal is still directional to protect other stations, such as CFRB in Toronto (itself a Class A station), the signal no longer has to protect Little Rock. Despite having been owned by CBS, WINS maintained an affiliation with ABC News Radio throughout, as WCBS was and remains the CBS Radio News affiliate for New York. WINS added a secondary affiliation with Westwood One News on January 1, 2015 after Westwood One ended a distribution deal with ABC News; WINS does not clear newscasts from either service but does air vocal reports and sound bites. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom, which fully separated WINS and WCBS radio from WCBS-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17, 2017. =Influence= CBS was the first broadcaster to make an attempt to mimic Westinghouse's all-news formula. Locally in New York, WINS' success as an all-news station spurred CBS to make a similar transformation with WCBS in August 1967.\\"WCBS to switch to more news\\". Broadcasting, July 31, 1967, pp. 45‚Äì46. Retrieved August 27, 2018. At first, WCBS did not go full-time with all-news, offering other programming during late nights, but joined WINS in broadcasting all-news around the clock by 1970.\\"News all-night\\". Broadcasting, January 12, 1970, pg. 60. Retrieved August 27, 2018. After completing the conversion of WCBS to all-news, five of CBS' other owned-and-operated AM stations also adopted the format; WCAU in Philadelphia and KNX in Los Angeles competed directly against KYW and KFWB, but with varying results. In 1975, NBC Radio tried a national all-news approach with its News and Information Service (NIS) network, but it was shut down in 1977 after only two years in operation. In the mid-1970s, Westinghouse's second Chicago station, WIND, carried the format part-time while competing against CBS-owned, all-news WBBM. WIND was not successful, and Westinghouse tried again after selling WIND in 1985 and acquiring WMAQ from NBC in 1988. Westinghouse converted WMAQ (now WSCR) into a full-time news outlet with mixed results. In the summer of 2011, New York would gain a third all-news station, this one on the FM dial, in WEMP's FM News 101.9. In the wake of meager ratings, the format abruptly flipped back to the alternative rock format that had been on the frequency three years prior. Later in 2012, Merlin Media, LLC sold the frequency to CBS Radio, which turned it into an FM simulcast of WFAN, making it a sister station to both WINS and WCBS. Today, the New York outlets co-exist with the format as Entercom-owned sister stations. , Entercom operates eight successful all-news stations around the U.S., including WINS, WCBS, WBBM, KNX, KYW, KCBS in San Francisco, WWJ in Detroit, and KRLD in Dallas. (WBZ in Boston had also been a Westinghouse/CBS all-news outlet until CBS Radio's merger with Entercom in November 2017 forced WBZ to be spun off to iHeartMedia to meet FCC ownership limits and concerns from the Department of Justice.)

Diefenbaker Building is a building in the New Edinburgh neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario. The building served as Ottawa's city hall from August 2, 1958 to January 1, 2001, and is commonly known as Old City Hall. Purchased in 2003 by the Government of Canada, it was known by its municipal address, 111 Sussex Drive, until September, 2011 when it was renamed after Canada's 13th prime minister, John Diefenbaker. Construction The building is located on Green Island at the point where the Rideau River empties into the Ottawa River. The historic city hall on Elgin Street had been destroyed by a fire in 1931. For the next 27 years the city operated out of temporary offices in the Transportation Building. The International Style building was opened on August 2, 1958 by Princess Margaret as a member of the Canadian Royal Family. It is noted for being the first building in Ottawa to be fully air conditioned. It was designed by John Bland of the firm Rother, Bland and Trudeau and is considered one of the most important International Style buildings in Canada, winning the Massey Medal for design in 1959. The original drawings for the building are held at the McGill University Library Special Collections as part of the John Bland Archive. City hall expansion In 1988 Ottawa mayor Jim Durrell initiated a controversial scheme to expand the building, quadrupling its original size. Architect Moshe Safdie was chosen for the redesign, carried out in 1992-93. Conflict soon broke out between Safdie and the city. Safdie demanded a higher fee and delayed the project for several months before the city acquiesced to his demand. Then a conflict broke out over a pair of eighteen story observation towers. City council voted to cut the towers to save the million dollars they cost. This infuriated Safdie who felt the towers were essential to the design. The panel that picked the design had singled out the tower as one of the highlights of the design. Eventually the city compromised and a bare scaffold was erected. The new building caused considerable controversy in the city with some liking the design, but others seeing the $72 million structure a waste of money. The building was much larger than the city needed and for several years large sections were vacant. In 1999 offices were rented out to Global Affairs Canada, which is based nearby, and this mostly filled the building. Federal government ownership On January 1, 2001, Ottawa was amalgamated with Cumberland, Gloucester, Goulbourn, Kanata, Nepean, Osgoode, Rideau, Rockcliffe Park, Vanier and West Carleton. It was decided that the new city would be based at 110 Laurier Avenue West. This building was considerably smaller but more centrally located. In 2003 the Old City Hall was sold to the federal Public Works department. Today the building mainly houses Global Affairs employees. For several months it was also the site of the Gomery Inquiry hearings.

Career In 1691, he moved to Rome, where he was patronized by Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, an enthusiast of Luti's pastel portraiture. Luti was one of the first artists to work in pastels as the final composition as opposed to initial studies for paintings or frescoes. He also worked in oils and painted frescoes, including for the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano.

It serves primarily as a venue for football, being the home of AS Monaco and the Monaco national football team. The stadium is most notable for its distinctive nine arches at the away end of the ground. The arena is also used for the Herculis, a track and field meet of the Diamond League. From 1998 to 2012, the stadium hosted the annual UEFA Super Cup match. History The original Stade Louis II was opened in 1939 as the home of AS Monaco. The decision to build a new sports centre in Monaco dates back to 1979. Prince Rainier III decided to establish a sports area in the Fontvieille district. The prince brought in Parisian architects to build the complex. The work began in May 1981 and ended in 1984, and required 120,000 m3 of concrete, 9,000 tonnes of iron and 2,000 tonnes of steel structure on a median land reclaimed from the sea. The complex was inaugurated on 25 January 1985 by Rainier III. The stadium has a current seating capacity of 16,360, and is named after Louis II, Prince of Monaco, who was the Sovereign Prince of Monaco when the original stadium was built. The vast majority of the stadium's facilities are located underground, including the multi-sports centre Gaston-Medecin, the aquatic centre Prince Albert II and a large car park directly under the pitch. Facilities The Salle Gaston M√©decin indoor arena is located under the stands of the football stadium. Salle Gaston M√©decin is able to host basketball, volleyball, and handball games, as well as judo and fencing matches, and weightlifting and gymnastics competitions. The stadium complex, besides the football stadium and athletics track and the Salle Gaston M√©decin, also contains the aquatic centre Prince Albert II, a large office complex, and also houses the International University of Monaco (IUM), which specializes in business education.

It can be small and manually operated and hold one simple die set, or be very large, CNC operated, with a multi-station turret and hold a much larger and complex die set. Mechanical punch press Punched hole: best results for cutting surface with above 70% cutting, low clearance necessary Description Punch presses are large machines with either a 'C' type frame, or a 'portal' (bridge) type frame. The C type has the hydraulic ram at the top foremost part, whereas the portal frame is much akin to a complete circle with the ram being centered within the frame to stop frame deflection or distortion. C type presses have a bed plate which is used to lock the die bottom bolster. For locking the die, T-bolts are used and so this plate contains T-slots into which T-bolts are slid in. These slots are placed diagonally and with a slot horizontal to the longer side of the plate, is the general practice. These slots run up to a central hole made in the plate, the hole being large enough to accommodate another bush with a hole, the hole being used for dropping the punched part to the bottom of the press. The top of the tool butted against a vertical sliding ram with a clamping system which accommodates only a particular diameter of a threaded cylindrical member called the \\"shank\\" of the tool. The bottom portion of the tool is locked to the bottom bed plate and the top portion of the tool is locked to the sliding ram. Top and bottom portions of the tool are generally guided by suitable pillar and bush assemblies, which gives safety to the punching elements of the tool. Generally the tool is placed slightly above the bottom bed plate by providing two parallel blocks accurately ground to the same size. This is a necessary action since many tools, scrap (cut pieces which are a waste) is discharged through the bottom element of the tool, not necessarily in the centre of the tool. The scrap or the blank (the required portion) come out from the die at different places. These have to be taken out horizontally from between the parallels placed. Otherwise they get accumulated inside the tool itself and cause severe damage to the tool. In very heavy presses with higher tonnage, the sliding ram has also a thick plate with T slots for locking the top plate of the tool (called the top bolster). In such cases the threaded cylinder called shank is not attached to the tool. The clamps are either mechanical (manually operated using spanners) or air operated varieties. Turret type punch press machines have a table or bed with brushes or rollers to allow the sheet metal workpiece to traverse with low friction. Brushes are used where scratches on the workpiece must be minimized, as with brushed aluminium or high polished materials. The punch press is characterized by parameters such as: *Frame type *Mechanism of delivering power to the ram (mechanical, electro-mechanical or hydraulic) *Size of working area (e.g., 2500 x 1250 mm) *Single or multiple station *Force rating (for example, 20 tons) *The type of tool shop and its capacity (e.g., store revolving type, capacity 34 tool) *Speed or productivity (typically characterized by the speed of strokes with a step movement of 25 and 1 mm) *Speed of movement without shock (speed-load displacement) *Maximum weight of workpiece *Safety features *Power consumption *The type of software Punch presses are usually referred to by their tonnage and table size. In a production environment a 30-ton press is mostly the machine used today. The tonnage needed to cut and form the material is well known, so sizing tooling for a specific job is a fairly straightforward task. According to the requirement the tonnage may even go up to 2000 to 2500 ton presses.  Die set  Quick change tool system (left: die; front: punch, split punch retainer; back: tool body; right: punch guide) A die set consists of a set of punches (male) and dies (female) which, when pressed together, form a hole in a workpiece (and may also deform the workpiece in some desired manner). The punches and dies are removable, with the punch being attached to the ram during the punching process. The ram moves up and down in a vertically linear motion, forcing the punch through the material into the die.  Axis  The main bed of most machines is called the 'X' axis, with the 'Y' axis being at right angles to that and allowed to traverse under CNC control. Dependent on the size of the machine, the beds, and the sheet metal workpiece weight, the motors required to move these axis tables will vary in size and power. Older styles of machines used DC motors; however, with advances in technology, today's machines mostly use AC brushless motors for drives.  CNC-controlled operation  To start a cycle, the CNC controller commands the drives to move the table along the X and the Y axis to a desired position. Once in position, the control initiates the punching sequence and pushes the ram from top dead center (TDC) to bottom dead center (BDC) through the material plane. (The terms BDC and TDC go back to older presses with pneumatic or hydraulic clutches. On today's machines BDC/TDC do not actually exist but are still used for the bottom and top of a stroke.) On its stroke from TDC to BDC, the punch enters the material, pushing it through the die, obtaining the shape determined by the design of the punch and die set. The piece of material (slug) cut from the workpiece is ejected through the die and bolster plate and collected in a scrap container.. The return to TDC signals to the control to begin the next cycle. The punch press is used for high volume production. Cycle times are often measured in milliseconds. Material yield is measured as a percentage of parts to waste per sheet processed. CAD/CAM programs maximize yield by nesting parts in the layout of the sheet. Drive type = Flywheel drive = Most punch presses today are hydraulically powered. Older machines, however, have mechanically driven rams, meaning the power to the ram is provided by a heavy, constantly rotating flywheel. The flywheel drives the ram using a Pitman arm. In the 19th century, the flywheels were powered by leather drive belts attached to line shafting, which in turn ran to a steam plant. In the modern workplace, the flywheel is powered by an electric motor. = Mechanical punch press = Mechanical punch presses fall into two distinct types, depending on the type of clutch or braking system with which they are equipped. Generally, older presses are \\"full revolution\\" presses that require a full revolution of the crankshaft for them to come to a stop. Full revolution clutch presses are known to be dangerous and outlawed in many countries unless the pinch point is fully guarded. This is because the braking mechanism depends on a set of raised keys or \\"dogs\\" to fall into matching slots to stop the ram. A full revolution clutch can only bring the ram to a stop at the same location - top dead center. Newer presses are often \\"part revolution\\" presses equipped with braking systems identical to the brakes on commercial trucks. When air is applied, a band-type brake expands and allows the crankshaft to revolve. When the stopping mechanism is applied the air is bled, causing the clutch to open and the braking system to close, stopping the ram in any part of its rotation. Modern part revolution clutch and brake units are normally combined units that operate in a fail safe mode, a dual air safety valve engages clutch and starts slide motion and brake is applied by springs. Part revolution clutch system on modern gap frame press = Hydraulic punch press = Hydraulic punch presses power the ram with a hydraulic cylinder rather than a flywheel, and are either valve controlled or valve and feedback controlled. Valve controlled machines usually allow a one stroke operation allowing the ram to stroke up and down when commanded. Controlled feedback systems allow the ram to be proportionally controlled to within fixed points as commanded. This allows greater control over the stroke of the ram, and increases punching rates as the ram no longer has to complete the traditional full stroke up and down but can operate within a very short window of stroke. = Servo drive turret punch press = A servo drive turret punch press uses twin AC servo drives directly coupled to the drive shaft. This drive system combines the simplicity of the original clutch and brake technology with the speed of a hydraulic ram driven system. This results in high performance, reliability, and lower operating costs. A servo drive press system has no complex hydraulics or oil-cooling chillers, thus reducing maintenance and repair costs. A turret press can be equipped with advanced technology that stores and reuses energy generated during ram deceleration, providing extended electrical power savings.

Although he was an accomplished solo pianist and composer, Levin received international acclaim for his work as an accompanist with several of the world's most celebrated vocal and instrumental performers. Background Levin was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. He grew up in the immigrant neighborhood in Gr√ºnerl√∏kka, the child of David Levin (1882‚Äì1936) and Marie Scheer (1885‚Äì1954). Both were Jewish refugees from Lithuania who had immigrated in 1905. Levin's father supported his family through various means, including peddling sewing notions and carting coal. Levin caught interest in the piano when he was four and a half years old, at his grandmother's home. By the time he was five, he had taught himself well enough for his first public performance. He did not receive formal lessons until he was ten, and when he was twelve he was accepted by the pre-eminent music teacher of the time, Nils Larsen. Levin did his part to support the family by performing at restaurants, bars, and movie theaters during the silent film era. He only finished the first six years of public schooling. He learned at the synagogue for his bar mitzvah, but was mostly occupied with his music. He was also an avid reader of diverse literature. Early professional career Like many of the classical musicians of pre-World War II era, Levin played at restaurants to support himself. He rose through the unofficial ranks as a teenager, overcoming strong antisemitic barriers. He took private lessons with concertmaster Gustav Fredrik Lange (1861‚Äì1939) and notably composer Fartein Valen (1887‚Äì1952), being exposed to a wide range of musical traditions and innovations. Levin was the last living silent movie veteran when he died in 1996. He also became an accomplished accordion player during this time. Levin had his performance debut on 26 January 1932 to widespread acclaim. Levin was introduced to several strains of modern music when he was engaged in the orchestra at Theatercafeen, where the Norwegian exponent of neo-Classical music Carl Gustav Sparre Olsen (1903‚Äì1984) performed. The orchestra also introduced Levin to jazz music. War years After Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940, Levin continued to perform but was subjected to daily threats and restrictions on the venues and music he could play. When Nazi authorities in occupied Norway started arresting and deporting Jews, Levin went under cover with friends and eventually fled to Sweden. The rest of his family arrived in Sweden a few days later, but many of Levin's closest relatives were deported from Norway and were victims of the Holocaust in Auschwitz. Levin became a proponent of Norwegian music and culture while in exile in Sweden. He wrote the music to several patriotic Norwegian songs, including Kirkenesmarsjen, a march to commemorate the liberation of the Northern Norwegian town of Kirkenes by Soviet troops on 25 October 1944. Sponsored by the Norwegian government-in- exile and Svenska Norgeshj√§lpen, Levin performed for members of the Norwegian Resistance Movement in Sweden along with his wife Solveig, Randi Heide Steen, Ernst Glaser, Gunnar S√∏nstevold, Hugo Kramm, Gunnar Reiss Andersen, Axel Kielland, Lauritz Falk, Sonja Mj√∏en, and others. Levin also sent packages to musical colleagues in Oslo under the pseudonym Banjo-Lasse. After the Liberation of Norway the Levin family returned to one of the central train stations in Oslo in June 1945. The orchestra which Robert Levin had to leave nearly three years earlier awaited him at the platform, performing at their arrival. Post-war career After the war, Levin decided to concentrate more on a classical career, and after he accompanied G√∂sta Kjellertz, his career as an accompanist took off. He accompanied such diverse international artists as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Yehudi Menuhin, Roberta Peters, Rita Streich, Henryk Szeryng, Ann Brown, Kim Borg, Camilla Wicks, Felicia Weathers; and a panorama of Norwegian artists that included Ingrid Bjoner, Knut Skram, Arve Tellefsen, Terje T√∏nnesen, Elise B√•tnes, Aase Nordmo L√∏vberg, Edith Thallaug, and Ole B√∏hn. Notably, on 22 May 1984, he and American pianist Robert D. Levin, performed together in Carnegie Hall in a concert called \\"From Grieg to Gershwin\\" with then Crown Prince Harald and Crown Princess Sonja in attendance. The two, along with other musicians including Ole B√∏hn, Knut Skram, Felicia Weathers, and Ingrid Bjoner performed pieces by Edvard Grieg, Richard Hageman, Harry Owens, Aaron Copland, Celius Dougherty, Oley Speaks, George Gershwin. Levin took part in performing tours all around the world. He became one of the most respected classical musicians of his time in Norway. He took an active part in music education at all ages, led the Norwegian Society of Composers and Lyricists (NOPA), and promoted the art of accompaniment. He was the first rector of the Norwegian Academy of Music when it was founded in 1973, where he was also a professor of interpretation. When the academy moved to its new facilities in Majorstuen in 1989, one of the performance halls was named after Levin. Awards Levin received the Houens legat (1951) and Statens kunstnerstip (1954). Levin was awarded the Norwegian Music Critics Award (Musikkritikerprisen) (1956/57), Lindemanprisen (1983) and Spellemannprisen (1977). He was also awarded the King's Medal of Merit (Kongens fortjenstmedalje) in gold and was made a member of the Order of St Olaf. In 1993, he was awarded the Anders Jahre Cultural Prize (Anders Jahres kulturpris) jointly with Stein Mehren. Personal life In 1938, he married Solveig Margrethe Bernstein (born 1914). They were the parents of journalist, Mona Levin (born 1939). Their daughter, Sidsel Levin (born 1944) was music teacher and cultural facilitator at the Jewish Museum in Oslo. Levin died during 1996 at the age of 84 and was buried at √òstre gravlund in Oslo.

ZipZaps are miniature radio- controlled cars that were sold by RadioShack, later marketed under the brand name XMODS Micro RC. They were commonly compared to Tomy's Bit Char-G (sold in the U.S. as MicroSizers) and Takara's Digi-Q micro R/C lines. Overview First introduced in September 2002, ZipZaps were an instant success and one of the most popular gifts of the holiday season in North America, with RadioShack stores often selling out of the starter kits. They were referred to as \\"micro R/C\\" due to their diminutive size. At around 1:64 scale, ZipZaps were only slightly larger than popular die-cast toy cars such as Hot Wheels and Matchbox.commutator less than 2 mm in diameter, on a direct-current motor in a toy radio control ZipZaps car.left ZipZaps were unique among toy-style micro R/C vehicles in that they could be customized much like large R/C models. Each partially assembled ZipZaps kit included a pre-assembled chassis with built-in nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries on which the gears, tires and hubcaps could be changed for better appearance and performance. Five motors and three gear ratios were offered, ranging from the 16,000 rpm stock unit to the high-speed 34,000 rpm \\"NX\\" (named after a popular brand of nitrous oxide). Gear ratios were 12:1 \\"stock\\", 9.86:1 \\"performance\\" and 8.25:1 \\"turbo\\". Tracking was adjusted via a wheel alignment lever underneath the vehicles themselves. The vehicle's on-board battery was charged by snapping the entire car onto the top of the transmitter. Full charge was accomplished in about 40 to 60 seconds with run times averaging five minutes. Neither steering nor throttle was proportional, with both functions either full on or full off. The SE series added semi-proportional, two-speed throttle and fully proportional rack-and-pinion steering with steering trim adjustable at the transmitter, as with a full-sized R/C. Further customizing options came from the variety of body shells which snapped on over the top of the chassis, allowing the car to take on the appearance of any number of popular cars including the Chevrolet Corvette, Toyota AE86, Audi TT, Ford GT, Ford Mustang, Hummer H1 and Mercedes- Benz SL. \\"Past and present\\" two-packs of body shells were sold as well, depicting early and late versions of sports cars and muscle cars. In addition to selling the Initial D manga, RadioShack also sold bodies for the SE chassis of the AE86 Trueno and the AE85 Levin from the series in a two-pack (which also included a few performance gears and motors) for the holiday season in 2002. Motion picture vehicles were represented by the Ford Gran Torino from Starsky & Hutch and the tuned imports from 2 Fast 2 Furious. RadioShack marketed a replica of Herbie that tied in with the Walt Disney Studios 2005 release of Herbie: Fully Loaded. In 2007, Radioshack released a set of ZipZaps for the live-action Transformers film, featuring Optimus Prime (the only model to feature a six-wheel chassis), Barricade, and Bumblebee. A series of monster trucks based on a larger chassis and with larger tires and motors and four wheel drive were available as well. The original ZipZaps operated on one of two frequencies: namely 27 MHz and 49 MHz, so no more than two people can reliably race simultaneously. The SE series and monster trucks featured selectable frequencies within the 27 MHz band for up to six racers along with working headlights and taillights. The SE series had proportional control and used a pistol grip style remote control. Motors, tires and wheel covers (called \\"hubs\\") were interchangeable between regular ZipZaps and the SE series. The bodies were also interchangeable, but the lights on SE bodies obviously did not work on the regular chassis. Accessories such as lap counters, autocross pylons and carrying cases were available as well. The popularity of ZipZaps waned somewhat in 2004 with RadioShack's introduction of XMODS.

It lies due north of capital Port Vila. Pentecost Island is known as in French and in Bislama. The island was known in its native languages by names such as Vanu Aroaroa, although these names are not in common use today. Pentecost has also been referred to as Raga or Araga, a tribal name that originated in the north but is now widely applied to the whole island. In old sources, it is occasionally referred to as Whitsuntide Island.  Geography  Pentecost is a lush, mountainous island which stretches north to south over some . It has an area of . The mountain range, of which the highest is Mount Vulmat (), marks the dividing line between the humid, rainy eastern coast and the more temperate western coast. The coastal plains, cross-cut by small torrents, are generally very green and ideally suited for plantations and livestock. The climate on Pentecost is humid tropical. The average annual rainfall is about 3,500 mm of rain. There are two seasons in the year: the rainy season, which lasts from November to April, and the dry season, which lasts from May to October. The island is subject to frequent cyclones and earthquakes.  History and Customs  It was first sighted by the Spanish expedition of Pedro Fernandez de Quiros in April 1606.Brand, Donald D. The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations New York: The American Geographical Society (New York, 1967) p.137. Pentecost was again sighted on the day of Pentecost, 22 May 1768, by Louis Antoine de Bougainville. It was also sighted by Captain James Cook, during his voyage through the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) in 1774. It was influenced by successive Christian missionaries but traditional customs there remain strong. Land diving Pentecost Island is most famous for being the spiritual birthplace of the extreme sport of bungee jumping, originating in an ages old ritual called the Gol (Bislama ), or land diving. Between April and June every year, men in the southern part of the island jump from tall towers (around ) with vines tied to their feet, in a ritual believed to ensure a good yam harvest. The ritual is also now used to show acceptance into manhood. Land diving was first given international exposure when David Attenborough and a BBC film crew brought back footage of the ritual during the 1950s, which aired as part of The People of Paradise documentary series. Visitors to Pentecost who witnessed the ceremony include Pope John Paul II (1986) and Queen Elizabeth II (1974). The north Pentecost village of Laone was the home of Walter Lini, who led Vanuatu to independence in 1980. Today, the 'father of the nation' is commemorated by a statue at the nearby Lini Memorial College. The Turaga indigenous movement, which rejects the Western economic system and instead promotes an alternative based on the \\"kastom economy\\", began on Pentecost and is based at Lavatmanggemu in the north-east of the island. The practice of grade-taking (the elevation of social status through the slaughter of valuable pigs) has been studied by anthropologists. Population The island has a population of almost 17,000 at the 2009 census.2009 Census Summary release final - Government of Vanuatu Pentecost's population centres are concentrated along the west coast, although a number of people also live inland. Major settlements along the west coast include (from north to south): Laone, Abwatuntora, Loltong, Latano, Nambwarangiut, Namaram, Bwatnapni, Melsisi, Ranwadi, Waterfall (Vanuu), Baravet, Lonoror, Hotwata, Panas, Wali, Panngi and Ranputor. Away from the coast, there are major settlements at Nazareth and Atavtabangga in the north, and at Enaa, Wutsunmwel, Tanbok, Naruwa, Ubiku and Tansip in the centre of the island. Most of these places have village telephones and one or two inhabitants who own 'trucks' (four- wheel-drive vehicles) or 'speedboats' (small motorboats), which the villagers use for transport. A couple of these villages also have small banks and post offices. The east coast is wild and inaccessible, with large uninhabited areas, although people are moving into previously uninhabited areas as the island's population increases. Major villages on the eastern side of the island include Ranwas, Bunlap and Baie Barrier (Ranon) in the south-east, and Renbura and Vanrasini further north.  Lifestyle and economy  The village of Melsisi on Pentecost Island There are no real towns on Pentecost. Most islanders live in small rural villages, surviving by subsistence agriculture and growing cash crops. Taro, a root vegetable well-suited to Pentecost's wet climate, is the staple food. Manioc (cassava), yams, bananas, kumala (sweet potato), coconuts, island cabbage, pawpaw (papaya), nakavika (rose apples), citrus, sugar cane, cacao, mangoes, pineapples, nuts, and European vegetables are also grown for local consumption. Vegetables are often grated into a paste, wrapped in large leaves, baked in an earthen oven and covered with coconut cream to create 'laplap', a savoury pudding. Pigs are highly important in Pentecost society, not only as food but as a traditional item of value, which may be given as payment during marriage ceremonies or as compensation for transgressions. Boars with long, curved tusks are particularly prized. Woven, red-dyed mats are also used as a traditional form of currency. Traditionally, copra (dried coconut meat) was Pentecost's main export, but this has now been overtaken by kava, a narcotic root used to prepare a traditional drink. Kava is grown and drunk on many islands in the South Pacific, but Pentecost is particularly well known for it, and much of the kava drunk in Vanuatu's towns and abroad originates on Pentecost. Cattle were once exported from Pentecost to the meat-processing factory at Luganville on neighbouring Santo island. However, most are now slaughtered locally instead, to feed Pentecost's growing population. Houses are traditionally constructed from local wood and bamboo, and thatched with leaves of natanggura (a variety of palm). However, wealthier islanders now build their houses instead using imported cement and corrugated metal.  Transport and communications  Pentecost Island has two airports, Lonorore Airport in the south-west and Sara Airport in the north, at which small airplanes land two or three times a week. Lonorore was upgraded in 2008‚Äì2009 with a new tarmacked airstrip capable of handling larger aircraft and operating in wet conditions; Sara remains a short grass airstrip. Cargo ships travelling between Port Vila and Luganville supply the island's west coast, although few ships visit the east coast, where sea conditions are rough and the population is sparse. A rutted dirt road runs from the north to the southwest of the island, and another road connects Salap in the southwest to Ranwas in the southeast. However, many villages are accessible only by steep mountain footpaths. Pentecost Island receives regular visits from yachties, who anchor at the villages of Loltong, Waterfall and Panngi. Panngi also has a jetty capable of receiving cruise ships, which make occasional visits during the land-diving season.  Language  Pentecost Island has five indigenous languages, all from the East Vanuatu language family: Raga (North Pentecost language), Apma (Central Pentecost language), Sowa (a recently extinct language of south-central Pentecost), Ske (a small and endangered language of south-western Pentecost), and Sa (South Pentecost language). Apma and Sa have multiple dialects. In addition, most people on Pentecost speak Bislama, the form of pidgin English that is Vanuatu's national language, and the island's native languages are becoming increasingly mixed with Bislama words and expressions. Educated islanders also know English or French, which are taught in schools.

It is \\"a classic story of life in a big, happy family.\\" set in a small Sussex town in the south east of England. It was regarded as innovative and groundbreaking for its portrayal of a working-class family at a time when children's books were dominated by stories about middle-class children. In 1938, Garnett won the second annual Carnegie Medal awarded by the Library Association for The Family from One End Street, recognising the best children's book by a British subject for the previous year. On the 70th anniversary of the Medal it was named one of the top ten winning works of the previous seventy years, selected by a panel from a public ballot to propose the all-time favourite. It is regarded as a classic, and remains in print, most recently reissued as a Puffin Classic in 2014. There were two sequels, Further Adventures of the Family from One End Street published in 1956 and Holiday at the Dew Drop Inn published in 1962 and subtitled \\"A One End Street story\\" in the United States. Collectively, the three novels are referred to as the \\"One End Street\\" series. Setting The Ruggles family lives at No. 1 One End Street in the heart of Otwell, located on the Ouse river. Otwell-on-the- Ouse is a fictional town resembling Lewes, Sussex, where the author lived. Josiah Ruggles works for Otwell council as a dustman and his wife Rosie takes in washing. They have seven children, so life is hard, but they are a happy family. CILIP, successor to the Library Association, assigns the subject tags \\"family large roisterous\\" and \\"family working class\\" in its online presentation of the Carnegie Medal winning books. Plot The story begins with Lily Rose, the eldest child, trying to help her mother Rosie with the ironing and ruining a green petticoat. She apologises to its owner, Mrs Beaseley, who forgives her. Mrs Beaseley also gives Kate (the second eldest child) her niece's cast off clothes for her new school, as the government funds to help with this are paid in arrears. Kate loses the school hat, and tries to sell mushrooms to pay for a new one, but the original is eventually found. Jim, the older and more ambitious of the Ruggles twins, meets and joins the local gang, the Black Hands, led by a twelve-year-old named Henry Oates. Though they consider him too young to join and accuse him of spying, Jim begs to be accepted. The next Saturday, as a hailstorm begins, Jim follows a dog into a drain pipe around a wharf's barge-loading area for shelter. Once the pipe is loaded on the barge Jim climbs aboard, hides in the pipe and is carried down the river to the seaport Salthaven. He is still in the pipe when it is loaded directly from the barge into a waiting ship. A man on the ship angrily returns him to the land, and the surrounding dock workers help him to get home. John, the younger twin, is a car fan and regularly visits Otwell Castle's car park. A wealthy couple called the Lawrences arrive at the castle, and allow him to \\"mind\\" their car. The same hailstorm which sends Jim into the pipe on the wharf for shelter catches John, and he climbs into the car for shelter. When the Lawrences return, they drive away without checking the back seat, and John does not awaken until they have driven some miles. Instead of turning around and taking him home, they invite him to their son's birthday party, and send a telegram to John's family to let them know that he is safe. William, the youngest Ruggles child, is entered in the Annual Baby Show, but the family is concerned as he is a late teether. He wins his age category (6‚Äì12 months) but an older competitor wins the Grand Challenge Cup as William has no teeth. The Ruggles return home only to find that William now has a tooth. Jo Ruggles junior, the fifth child, a Mickey Mouse fan, enjoys watching cartoons at the cinema. On Saturday morning he sneaks inside the empty building and hides in the orchestra pit to see the first colour Mickey Mouse film, where he soon falls asleep; several hours later, several cinema musicians find him. Jo explains why he sneaked in, and the men give him sixpence for the show, and a warning not to do it again. Mr Ruggles receives a reward of ¬£2 for returning some lost money, which he uses to take his family to the Cart Horse Parade in London's Regent's Park, where Mr Ruggles' brother has entered his horse in the competition. The horse, Bernard Shaw, takes first place, and the families climb into the cart to participate in the parade. The Ruggles spend the afternoon at a \\"posh\\" tea shop, nearly missing their train home in the excitement. Publication history Eve Garnett herself wrote that The Family From One End Street was rejected as unsuitable by at least eight other publishers before being taken by Muller. The US Library of Congress gives a longer title, The Family from One End street and some of their adventures, for its oldest holding, a 1939 UK edition. Recent British editions have been published by Puffin. The Family first appeared as a Puffin Book in 1942, under the editorship of Eleanor Graham, only a year after Penguin Books introduced the imprint. * (Puffin, UK, late 1980s reprint) See also References External links ‚Äîimmediately, first US edition British children's novels Carnegie Medal in Literature winning works Novels set in Sussex 1937 British novels 1937 children's books ","title":"The Family from One End Street"},{"id":"1841205","text":"The Fea's muntjac or Tenasserim muntjac (Muntiacus feae) is a rare species of muntjac native to southern Myanmar and Thailand.

Soldiers equipped with the Sig 550 assault rifle used to be issued 50 rounds of ammunition in a sealed can, to be opened only upon alert and for use while en route to join their unit. This practice was stopped in 2007. In order to purchase ammunition, the buyer must fulfill the same legal rules that apply when buying gunsbuyer must be over the age of 18, not under a curator nor identified as being a danger for themselves or others, and don't have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions as long as they haven't been written out. (art. 15 WG/LArm). Foreigners with citizenship to the following countries are explicitly excluded from the right to buy and own ammunition: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania. The buyer must provide the following information to the seller (art. 15, 16 WG/LArm; art. 24 WV/OArm): *a passport or other valid official identification (the holder must be over 18 years of age) (art. 10a WG/LArm). *a copy of their criminal record not older than 3 months, or a weapons acquisition permit which isn't older than 2 years, if asked by the seller (art. 24 ¬ß 3 WV/OArm). A Swiss 100 gram black powder container. The possession of the following ammunition is generally prohibited: * Armor-piercing bullets. * Ammunition with projectile containing an explosive or incendiary device. * Ammunition with one or more projectiles releasing substances which damage the health of people in the long run, particularly those mentioned in annex 2 of the WV/OArm. * Ammunition, missiles and missile launchers for military explosive. * Ammunition with projectiles for transmitting electric shocks. * Ammunition for handguns which may cause deformations. =Carrying guns= To carry a firearm in public or outdoors (and for a militia member to carry a firearm other than his issued weapons while off-duty), a person must have a gun carrying permit (, , ; art. 27 WG/LArm), which in most cases is issued only to private citizens working in occupations such as security. It is, however, quite common to see a person in military service to be en route with his rifle, albeit unloaded. The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective (see #Conditions_for_obtaining_a_Carrying_Permit). However, it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder (art. 27 ¬ß 4 WG/LArm): * Has a valid hunting license and is carrying the firearm for hunting. * Is participating in a demonstration and is carrying the firearm in reference to a historical event. * Is participating in a shooting competition for air-soft guns, provided that the competition has a secure perimeter. * Is an airport security officer for an authorized country, a border patrol officer, or a game warden, who is carrying the firearm in the course of their employment. Furthermore, any licensed holder of a gun may transport an unloaded firearm for special situations (see #Transporting guns). Conditions for obtaining a Carrying Permit There are three conditions (art. 27 ¬ß 2 WG/LArm): * fulfilling the conditions for a buying permit (see section above). * stating plausibly the need to carry firearms to protect oneself, other people, or real property from a specified danger. * passing an examination proving both weapon handling skills and knowledge regarding lawful use of the weapon. The carrying permit remains valid for a term of five years (unless otherwise surrendered or revoked), and applies only to the type of firearm for which the permit was issued. Additional constraints may be invoked to modify any specific permit. (art. 27 ¬ß 3 WG/LArm). =Transporting guns= Guns may be transported in public as long as an appropriate justification is present. This means to transport a gun in public, the following requirements apply (art. 28 WG/LArm): * The gun must be unloaded and transported separately from any ammunition, with no ammunition being transported in a magazine. * The transport must be by a reasonable route and requires a valid purpose:  To or from courses or exercises in marksmanship, hunting or for military purposes.  To or from an army warehouse.  To show the gun to a possible buyer.  To or from a holder of a valid arms trade permit.  To or from a specific event, e.g. gun shows.  During change of residence. =EU firearm ban= A 2017 amendment to the European Firearms Directive, known as the \\"EU Gun Ban\\", introduces new restrictions on firearms possession and acquisition, especially on semi-automatic firearms, personal defense weapons, magazine capacity, blank firing guns and historical firearms. The restrictions must be introduced into the Swiss legal system by August 2018 due to its membership of the Schengen area. The Directive also includes an exemption covering a specific Swiss issue ‚Äì it allows possession to a target shooter of one firearm used during the mandatory military period after leaving the army, provided it was converted to semi-automatic only (art. 6(6) of the Amendment Directive). This part of the Directive specifically was however challenged by the Czech Republic before the European Court of Justice due to its discriminatory nature. The Czech Republic seeks nullification of the \\"Swiss exemption\\" as well as of other parts of the Directive. Civil rights organizations planned to hold a referendum to reject the amended EU directive.https://www.finger-weg-vom-schweizer- waffenrecht.ch/2017/04/offener-brief-an-den-bundesrat-nationalrat- staenderat/https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/waffenrecht-schiessen-schweizer- schuetzen-schengen-ab-ld.1085409 According to Swiss People's Party vice- president Christoph Blocher, Switzerland should consider abandoning EU's borderless Schengen Area if the Swiss people reject the proposed measures in a referendum. In a referendum held on 19 May 2019, voters supported the stricter EU restrictions on semi-automatic weapons, as recommended by the government. Army-issued arms and ammunition collection The Swiss army has long been a militia trained and structured to rapidly respond against foreign aggression. Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school, the basic-training camp, after which Swiss men remain part of the \\"militia\\" in reserve capacity until age 30 (age 34 for officers). Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government. This was so that, in the case of an emergency, the militia could respond quickly. The federal shooting range of Versoix, Switzerland; people come to such ranges to complete mandatory training (Obligatorischeschiessen) with service arms, or to shoot for sport and competition. In December 2007, the Swiss Federal Council decided that the distribution of ammunition to soldiers would stop and that previously issued ammo would be returned. By March 2011, more than 99% of the ammo has been received. Only 2,000 specialist militia members (who protect airports and other sites of particular sensitivity) are permitted to keep their military- issued ammunition at home. The rest of the militia get their ammunition from their military armory in the event of an emergency. When their period of service has ended, militia men have the choice of keeping their personal weapon and other selected items of their equipment. However, keeping the weapon after end of service requires a weapon acquisition permit (art. 11-15 VPAA/OEPM). The government sponsors training with rifles and shooting in competitions for interested adolescents, both male and female. The sale of military-issued ammunition, including Gw Pat.90 rounds for army-issued assault rifles, is subsidized by the Swiss government and made available at the many Federal Council licensed shooting ranges. That ammunition sold at ranges must be immediately used there under supervision (art. 16 WG/LArm). The Swiss Army maintains tightened adherence to high standards of lawful military conduct. In 2005, for example, when the Swiss prosecuted recruits who had reenacted the torture scenes of Abu Ghraib, one of the charges was improper use of service weapons. =Recreational shooting= Recreational shooting is widespread in Switzerland. Practice with guns is a popular form of recreation, and is encouraged by the government, particularly for the members of the militia. Prior to the turn of the century, about 200,000 people used to attend the annual Eidgen√∂ssisches Feldschiessen, which is the largest rifle shooting competition in the world. In 2012 they counted 130,000 participants. For the 2015 Federal Shooting (Eidg. Sch√ºtzenfest) 37,000 shooters are registered. In addition, there are several private shooting ranges which rent guns. Gun culture in Switzerland Switzerland has a strong gun culture compared to other countries in the world. In 2016 SwissOlympics conducted a study on clubs and members in Switzerland: the Swiss Sport Shooting Federation is ranked 2nd in terms of clubs and 9th in terms of members. Those affiliated with the Federation are shooters needing a license in order to compete, those that don't need one will probably not be members as it is not needed. Groups like ProTell lobby for the preservation of Switzerland's gun rights. Additionally, the Schweizerischer Sch√ºtzenverein, a Swiss shooting association, organizes the Eidgen√∂ssische Sch√ºtzenfeste, every five years and the Eidgen√∂ssisches Feldschiessen is held annually. Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle. Another possibility for the children to shoot is the Young Shooters: the SAT (lit. shooting and off-duty activities) oversees lessons in which Swiss children can learn how to shoot using the SIG SG 550 starting at 15 years old for the regular course. This activity is free and the Young Shooters are able to take home the rifle in-between the lessons if they are 17. For security reasons however, the bolt has to stay at the range in which they attend the lesson. This training takes place over a span of 6 years within a 3-4-month period each year and, if wanted, they can become instructors for the new generation of Young Shooters. Traditionally liberal Swiss gun legislation has, however, been somewhat tightened in 2008, when Switzerland has complied with European Firearms Directive.https://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/switzerland.php Throughout the modern political history of Switzerland, there have been advocates for tighter gun control. The most recent suggestion for tighter gun control was rejected in a popular referendum in February 2011.. In a referendum held on 19 May 2019, voters supported the stricter EU restrictions on semi-automatic weapons, as recommended by the government. Firearm-related deaths The vast majority of firearm-related deaths in Switzerland are suicides. The suicide method of shooting oneself with a firearm accounted for 21.5% of suicides in Switzerland in the period of 2001‚Äì2012 (with significant gender imbalance: 29.7% of male suicides vs. 3.0% of female suicides). By contrast, gun crime is comparatively limited. In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world.https://dataunodc.un.org/crime/intentional-homicide-victims Of the recorded homicides (attempted or completed), 20.3% were committed with a gun (47 cases, compared to an average of 41 cases in the period of 2009‚Äì2015). In addition, there were 7 cases of bodily harm and 233 cases of robbery committed with firearms. There were 16 completed homicides with a firearm in 2016. Of these, 14 were committed with a handgun, one with a long gun and one case marked \\"other/unspecified\\". None of the involved weapons were ordinance weapons issued by the Swiss Armed Forces. Similarly, out of 31 attempted homicides with firearms, 25 were committed with handguns, two with long guns and four \\"other/unspecified\\", with no use of ordinance weapons on record. For the period of 2009‚Äì2016, on average 16.5 out of 49.4 completed homicides were committed with a firearm, 13.8 with handguns, 1.9 with long guns and 0.9 \\"other/unspecified\\"; an average 0.75 cases per year (6 cases in eight years) involved ordinance weapons.T√∂tungsdelikt: Aufkl√§rung und Vorjahresvergleich (vollendet und versucht) nach Tatmittel, Beschuldigte und Gesch√§digte 2016 27 March 2017.

Such gaps represent periods from which excavators have not yet found relevant fossils. Romer's gap is named after paleontologist Alfred Romer, who first recognised it.By 1955 (perhaps even earlier), Romer states that few good fossils of tetrapods have been recovered from early Carboniferous deposits. See: Romer, Alfred Sherwood (presented: November 11, 1955 ; published: June 28, 1956) \\"The early evolution of land vertebrates,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 100 (3) : 151-167; see especially page 166. Available on-line at: JSTOR. Recent discoveries in Scotland are beginning to close this gap in palaeontological knowledge. Age Romer's gap ran from approximately 360 to 345 million years ago, corresponding to the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous, the early Mississippian (starting with the Tournaisian and moving into the Visean). The gap forms a discontinuity between the primitive forests and high diversity of fishes in the end Devonian and more modern aquatic and terrestrial assemblages of the early Carboniferous. Crassigyrinus, a secondarily aquatic non-amniote tetrapod from Romer's gap Mechanism behind the gap There has been long debate as to why there are so few fossils from this time period. Some have suggested the problem was of fossilization itself, suggesting that there may have been differences in the geochemistry of the time that did not favour fossil formation. Also, excavators simply may not have dug in the right places. The existence of a true low point in vertebrate diversity has been supported by independent lines of evidence, however recent finds in five new locations in Scotland have yielded multiple fossils of early tetrapods and amphibians. They have also allowed the most accurate logging of the geology of this period. This new evidence suggests that - at least locally - there was no gap in diversity or changes in oxygen geochemistry. While initial arthropod terrestriality was well under way before the gap, and some digited tetrapods might have come on land, there are remarkably few terrestrial or aquatic fossils that date from the gap itself. Recent work on Paleozoic geochemistry has provided evidence for the biological reality of Romer's gap in both terrestrial vertebrates and arthropods, and has correlated it with a period of unusually low atmospheric oxygen concentration, which was determined from the idiosyncratic geochemistry of rocks formed during Romer's gap. The new sedimentary logging in the Ballagan Formation in Scotland challenges this, suggesting oxygen was stable throughout Romer's Gap. Aquatic vertebrates, which include most tetrapods during the Carboniferous, were recovering from the Late Devonian extinction, a major extinction event that preceded Romer's gap, one on par with that which killed the dinosaurs. In this Hangenberg event, most marine and freshwater groups became extinct or were reduced to a few lineages, although the precise mechanism of the extinction is unclear. Before the event, oceans and lakes were dominated by lobe-finned fishes and armored fishes called placoderms. After the gap, modern ray finned fish, as well as sharks and their relatives were the dominant forms. The period also saw the demise of the Ichthyostegalia, the early fish-like amphibians with more than five digits. The low diversity of marine fishes, particularly shell-crushing predators (durophages), at the beginning of Romer's gap is supported by the sudden abundance of hard-shelled crinoid echinoderms during the same period. The Tournaisian has even been called the \\"Age of Crinoids\\". Once the number of shell-crushing ray-finned fishes and sharks increased later in the Carboniferous, coincident with the end of Romer's gap, the diversity of crinoids with Devonian-type armor plummeted, following the pattern of a classic predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) cycle. There is increasing evidence that lungfish and stem tetrapods and amphibians recovered quickly and diversified in the rapidly changing environment of the end-Devonian and Romer's Gap. Gap fauna The bank of the Whiteadder Water in Scotland is one of the few known localities bearing fossils of tetrapods from Romer's gap. The gap in the tetrapod record has been progressively closed with the discoveries of such early Carboniferous tetrapods as Pederpes and Crassigyrinus. There are a few sites where vertebrate fossils have been found to help fill in the gap, such as the East Kirkton Quarry, in Bathgate, Scotland, a long-known fossil site that was revisited by Stanley P. Wood in 1984 and has since been revealing a number of early tetrapods in the mid Carboniferous; \\"literally dozens of tetrapods came rolling out: Balanerpeton (a temnospondyl), Silvanerpeton and Eldeceeon (basal anthracosaurs), all in multiple copies, and one spectacular proto-amniote, Westlothiana\\", Paleos Project reports. In 2016, five new species were found across the Ballagan Formation: Perittodus apsconditus, Koilops herma, Ossirarus kierani, Diploradus austiumensis, Aytonerpeton microps. These stem tetrapods and amphibians provide evidence for an early split between the two groups, and rapid diversification in the Early Carboniferous. However, tetrapod material in the earliest stage of the Carboniferous, the Tournaisian, remains scarce relative to fishes in the same habitats, which can appear in large death assemblages, and is unknown until late in the stage. Fish faunas from Tournaisian sites around the world are very alike in composition, containing common and ecologically similar species of ray-finned fishes, rhizodont lobe- finned fishes, acanthodians, sharks, and holocephalans. Recent analysis of the Blue Beach deposits in Nova Scotia suggest that \\"the early tetrapod fauna is not easily divisible into Devonian and Carboniferous faunas, suggesting that some tetrapods passed through the end Devonian extinction event unaffected.\\" Tournaisian-age locations For many years after Romer's gap was first recognised, only two sites yielding Tournaisian-age tetrapod fossils were known; one is in East Lothian, Scotland, and another in Blue Beach, Nova Scotia, where in 1841, Sir William Logan, the first Director of the Geological Survey of Canada, found footprints from a tetrapod. From p. 712: \\"At Horton Bluff, ten miles north of Windsor [, Nova Scotia], ‚Ä¶ he also obtained a slab which appears to him to exhibit foot-marks, ‚Ä¶ \\"During 1841‚Äì1842, Scottish geologist Charles Lyell visited North America, including Nova Scotia. In 1843, Lyell mentioned Logan's discovery of footprints in the Carboniferous deposits of Horton Bluff. English paleontologist Richard Owen claimed that Logan's footprints were those of a reptile. See: * ; see p. 185. From p. 185: \\"With these Mr. Lyell found in Horton Bluff scales of a ganoid fish, and in the ripple-marked sandstones of the same place, Mr. Logan discovered footsteps, which appeared to Mr. Owen to belong to some unknown species of reptile, constituting the first indications of the reptilian class known in the carboniferous rocks.\\" * Reprinted in: ; see p. 358. Blue Beach maintains a fossil museum that displays hundreds of Tournaisian fossils, which continue to be found as the cliff erodes to reveal new fossils. In 2012, 350-million-year- old tetrapod remains from four new Tournaisian sites in Scotland were announced, including those from a primitive amphibian nicknamed \\"Ribbo\\".Chirnside fossils could provide key to Romer‚Äôs Gap Already the collection has revealed one notable amphibian specimen that has been nicknamed ‚ÄòRibbo‚Äô due to its prominent and well-preserved ribs, providing scientists with enough information to interpret what the creature may have looked like as it roamed the Tweed basin around 350 million years ago. In 2016, five more species were unearthed from these localities, proving Scotland to be one of the most important sites in the world for understanding this time period.'Scotland holds the key to understanding how life first walked on land' The Guardian - https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/19/fossils- palaeontology-romer-scotland-holds-the-key-to-understanding-how-life-first- walked-on-land These localities are the coast of Burnmouth, the banks of the Whiteadder Water near Chirnside, the River Tweed near Coldstream, and the rocks near Tantallon Castle alongside the Firth of Forth. Fossils of both aquatic and terrestrial tetrapods are known from these localities, providing an important record of the transition between life in water and life on land and filling some of the lacunae in Romer's gap. These new localities may represent a larger fauna, as all lie within a short distance of each other and share many fishes with the nearby and contemporary Foulden fish bed locality (which has not produced tetrapods thus far). As with East Kirkton Quarry, tetrapods at these sites were discovered through the long-term efforts of Stan Wood and colleagues. In April 2013 scientists associated with the British Geological Survey (BGS) and the National Museums of Scotland announced the TW:eed project (Tetrapod World: early evolution and diversification). This project includes collaborators from across the UK, and aims to gather knowledge on the end-Devonian Early-Carboniferous world. One aim has been to drill a continuous 500-meter borehole at an undisclosed location near Berwick- upon-Tweed. This has produced a complete, centimetre-scale sampling of Tournaisian sediment, without discontinuities, providing a timeline on which fossil discoveries can be accurately placed.\\"Fossil hunters dig deep in Scottish Borders\\", news.Scotsman.com: accessed 6 April 3013 In the most recent paper to be produced by the TW:eed team, they announced some initial results from the core, including the apparent lack of oxygen excursion across Romer's Gap. This suggests that previous theories about low oxygen being the cause of Romer's Gap will need to be re-evaluated.

However, without further evidence, the exact position of Roosevelt's muntjac cannot be stated. Berlin Zoo supposedly held this species between 1961 and 1972 (following an import from Northern Vietnam) but it could have been an Indian muntjac subspecies annamensis. Roosevelt's muntjac was believed to have been extinct since 1929. However, there have been several recent claims to have rediscovered the species, from evidence including skulls owned by villagers in the Truong Son (Annamite) mountains of northern Laos and far northwestern Vietnam. More recently, photographs from a camera trap at Xuan Lien Nature Reserve in Vietnam appear to have identified two individuals.

Hongshan culture is #1 on the map The C-shaped jade dragon of Hongshan Culture The Hongshan culture () was a Neolithic culture in the Liao river basin in northeast China. Hongshan sites have been found in an area stretching from Inner Mongolia to Liaoning, and dated from about 4700 to 2900 BC. Timeline posted by National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. The culture is named after Hongshanhou (), a site in Hongshan District, Chifeng. The Hongshanhou site was discovered by the Japanese archaeologist Torii Ry≈´z≈ç in 1908 and extensively excavated in 1935 by K≈çsaku Hamada and Mizuno Seiichi.Hamada, Kosaku and Mizuno Seiichi. \\"Chifeng Hongshanhou,\\" Archaeologia Orientalis, ser. A, No. 6. Far-Eastern Archaeology Society of Japan, (1938). Historical context In northeast China, Hongshan culture was preceded by Xinglongwa culture (6200‚Äì5400 BC), Xinle culture (5300‚Äì4800 BC), and Zhaobaogou culture, which may be contemporary with Xinle and a little later. Yangshao culture was in the larger area and contemporary with Hongshan culture (see map). These two cultures interacted with each other.  Genetics and ethnic identity  A study by Yinqiu Cui et al. from 2013 found that 63% of the combined samples from various Hongshan archeological sites belonged to the subclade N1 (xN1a, N1c) of the paternal haplogroup N-M231 and calculated N to have been the predominant haplogroup in the region in the Neolithic period at 89%, its share gradually declining over time. Today this haplogroup is most common in Finland, the Baltic states and among northern Siberian ethnicities, such as the Yakuts. Other paternal haplogroups identified in the study were C and O2a (O2a2), both of which predominate among the present-day inhabitants.

Allen won the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship twice and was being groomed for a potential run with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but a car accident in 1986 forced him into retirement. After retiring, Magnum T.A. continued to appear in non-wrestling roles for multiple promotions. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1978‚Äì1984)= Allen started wrestling in 1978 and joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), where he began competing for the Championship Wrestling from Florida and the Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW) territories. While in the CWF, Allen won the Global Tag Team Championship on five occasions before then moving to Mid-South Wrestling. Upon debuting in Mid-South, Allen renamed himself \\"Magnum T.A.\\" and adopted a character known as the \\"American Heart Throb\\", based on Allen's slight resemblance to actor Tom Selleck, who at the time was starring in the popular television series Magnum, P.I.. Allen adopted the ring name after Andr√© the Giant suggested that he combine the Magnum name with the initials of his real name. After competing in Mid-South, he won the North American Heavyweight Championship, his first major title, after defeating Mr. Wrestling II on May 13, 1984. Magnum would hold the title for five months before he lost it to the \\"Cat\\" Ernie Ladd on October 16. On November 22, Magnum lost to Ladd via disqualification in a title rematch. =Jim Crockett Promotions (1984‚Äì1986)= In 1984, the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions signed Allen. After debuting, Magnum began feuding with Wahoo McDaniel and defeated him for the United States Heavyweight Championship on March 23, 1985. At The Great American Bash, he successfully defended the title by defeating Kamala. He then began feuding with the Four Horsemen before feuding solely with Horsemen member Tully Blanchard and his valet Baby Doll. On September 28, Magnum lost to the Horsemen's leader Ric Flair in a near-30 minute title match for Flair's World Heavyweight Championship. Magnum would later lose his U.S. Title to Blanchard until Magnum regained the title in a famous \\"I Quit\\" match at Starrcade on November 28. In April 1986, Magnum began feuding with Ivan Koloff, who had started proclaiming that his nephew, Nikita, would become the United States Heavyweight Champion. Jim Crockett, Jr. set up a contract signing for Magnum to defend his title against Nikita in May. At the signing, Magnum brought his mother, Marion, while Nikita brought Ivan. However, Nikita insulted Magnum's mother during the signing, instigating a fight. Then-president of the NWA, Bob Geigel, issued a public reprimand against Magnum for \\"conduct unbecoming a champion.\\" Magnum replied, \\"Reprimand this!\\" while punching Geigel. As a result, Magnum was stripped of his title and it was put up in a best of seven series between Magnum and Nikita. After losing the first three matches in a row to Nikita, Magnum began a comeback, winning the next three matches to keep the series going. In the tie-breaking match on August 17, 1986, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Nikita defeated Magnum to win the title with help from Ivan and Krusher Khruschev. =Car accident and retirement= On October 14, 1986, Allen was driving in his Porsche in the rain and lost control, wrapping the car around a telephone pole. The accident happened on Sardis Road in Charlotte, North Carolina, only a couple of miles from his home. Initially, investigators believed he was speeding, but forensic reports showed he was driving the speed limit and he was left in his car for two hours before a witness called 911. The accident caused his C-4 and C-5 vertebrae to \\"explode\\", and it was doubted at the time whether he would ever walk again. Doctors at Carolinas Medical Center said Allen's physical conditioning saved his life. The right side of his body was paralyzed for months, ending his in- ring career. Losing Allen as a wrestler prompted NWA booker Dusty Rhodes to turn Nikita Koloff, Allen's last rival prior to his accident, into a babyface. According to the storyline, Koloff gained respect for Magnum from their feud and wanted to take his place. This was memorialized in the spring edition of the Wrestling '87 magazine, with a large photograph of Koloff with the words \\"I cry for Magnum T.A.\\" beside him. Prior to his accident, Magnum was to win the U.S. Title for the third time before being groomed to become the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Magnum's first on-screen appearance following the accident was on TBS's Supertowns on the Superstation, in an interview with Tony Schiavone. His first appearance in front of a live crowd was at the Crockett Cup in 1987, where, with the aid of a cane and two referees, Magnum walked to ringside to embrace Dusty and Nikita, who would go on to defeat Tully Blanchard and Lex Luger for the tournament championship. Magnum (as \\"The Boss\\" Magnum T.A.) hosted an interview segment titled Straight Talk with The Boss on NWA World Wide Wrestling in 1988. Magnum later worked as a commentator for the NWA, UWF, and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and also served as a manager for Rhodes and Koloff. In his last angle in WCW in March 1988, Magnum was attacked by his former rival Tully Blanchard, which prompted Dusty Rhodes to come to the aid of his friend. Rhodes was subsequently suspended and returned as The Midnight Rider, managed by Magnum. After Rhodes signed with Championship Wrestling from Florida and later the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and Koloff signed with the American Wrestling Association (AWA), Magnum left JCP as well, although he would make sporadic reappearances with the promotion until 1993 at Slamboree. On May 20, 1995, Allen made his first wrestling appearance in years as part of a legends recognition at Smoky Mountain Wrestling's \\"Carolina Memories\\" show in Charlotte. On January 14, 2005, Allen made an appearance as a guest at the Exodus Wrestling Alliance. He would later appear for the Carolina Wrestling Association in the corner of Jason Jones during Jones' loss to George South, Jr. on May 21. At the event Tribute To Starrcade on November 19, Magnum stood in Rhodes' corner as he lost to Tully Blanchard. On June 24, 2007, Allen, as Magnum T.A., made his first appearance for World Wrestling Entertainment at their Vengeance: Night of Champions pay-per-view, where he was noted as a former United States Champion. Personal life Allen attended high school at Norfolk Collegiate School in Norfolk, Virginia. He was a member of the collegiate wrestling team and won the state championship in the 167 pound division. After graduating high school, he attended Old Dominion University. Allen is stepfather to Tessa Blanchard, who moved in with him and her siblings and mother at age 4. He works as a manager at a network-solutions company and resides in Charlotte.

It is the band's only album to feature both guitarist James Murphy and bassist Terry Butler and the last to feature drummer Bill Andrews. This is the first of Death's albums to show Schuldiner's lyrics moving away from the gore and horror themes of previous works, focusing instead on themes of society including abortion, genetics, and televangelism, a direction that would be further refined on 1991's Human album. The musical content is more obviously melodic, a facet highlighted by James Murphy's characteristic lead guitar playing. The members of Death and their manager/co-producer Eric Greif stayed in a single motel room at the Safari Inn, near Busch Gardens, for the entire six weeks the album was recorded and mixed, although bassist Terry Butler and drummer Bill Andrews frequently went home as they lived in the Tampa area. This was the final Death album cover painted by Ed Repka.

The rulers of the rump state, notably its final ruler Syagrius, were referred to as \\"Kings of the Romans\\" (Latin: rex Romanorum) by the Germanic peoples surrounding Soissons, with the polity itself being identified as the Regnum Romanorum, \\"Kingdom of the Romans\\", by the Gallo-Roman historian Gregory of Tours. Whether this title was used by Syagrius himself, who claimed to be governing a Roman province and not a state independent from central imperial authority, or was applied to him by the barbarians surrounding his realm in a similar way to how they referred to their own leaders as kings is unknown.S. Fanning, \\"Emperors and empires in fifth-century Gaul\\", in John Drinkwater and Hugh Elton, Fifth-Century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity? (Cambridge: University Press, 1992), pp. 288-297 The emergence of the Domain of Soissons began when Emperor Majorian (457‚Äì461) appointed Aegidius as magister militum of Roman Gaul. When Majorian was killed on the orders of Ricimer in 461, Aegidius maintained his own rule in the remnants of Roman Gaul that came to be known as the Domain or Kingdom of Soissons. In the chaos of contemporary Gaul, he maintained his power against Franks to his east and Visigoths to his south; his relations to the Romano-British of Brittany may have been friendly. Aegidius died in 464 or 465. His son Syagrius succeeded to the rule. In 486 Syagrius lost the Battle of Soissons to the Frankish king Clovis I and the domain was thereafter under the control of the Franks. History Kingdom of Syagrius (North-West) within the Western Roman Empire (blue) The Kingdom of Soissons originated in the reign of the Western Emperor Majorian (457-461). Majorian appointed Aegidius to be magister militum of the Gallic provinces. The remaining Roman territory in Gaul in the northwest was connected with the Roman possessions in the Auvergne, Provence and Languedoc which connected these to Italy. During Majorian's reign, that corridor was annexed by the Germanic tribes now occupying Gaul, thus effectively cutting off Aegidius and his citizens from the Empire. Majorian and Aegidius had recovered the Roman position in most of Gaul, but with the death of Majorian in 461 the Roman position in the center and south deteriorated. These provinces were annexed by the Visigoths and Burgundians in the years 462-477, which left the remaining Roman territories in Gaul isolated. Aegidius was allied with the Alans, and with Childeric I, king of the Salian Franks of Tournai, and helped them defeat the Visigoths at Orl√©ans in 463. According to Gregory of Tours, Aegidius even ruled the Franks during Childeric's banishment, but Childeric later returned from exile. It is possible that the Groans of the Britons, referring to a Romano-British request for military assistance after the Roman departure from Britain, may have been addressed to Aegidius. Aegidius continued to govern until his death in 464. His comes, Paulus of Angers, was killed shortly afterwards, possibly on the same campaign. At that point Aegidius's son, Syagrius, took his place as ruler. Syagrius governed using the title of dux (a provincial military commander), but the neighboring Germanic tribes referred to him as \\"King of the Romans\\"; hence one of the nicknames of his enclave. In 476, under the rule of Syagrius, the Kingdom of Soissons failed to accept the new rule of Odoacer who had dethroned the Western Emperor earlier that year. While both Syagrius and Odoacer sent messengers to the Eastern Roman Empire, the Eastern emperor Zeno chose to offer legitimacy to Odoacer instead of Syagrius. The Kingdom of Soissons cut all ties with Italy and had no further recorded contact with the Eastern Roman Empire. Even after 476, Syagrius continued to maintain that he was merely governing a Roman province. The Domain of Soissons was in fact an independent region. Childeric died about 481, and his son Clovis I became the Frankish king. Clovis made continual war against Syagrius, and in the end took over all his territory. Syagrius lost the final Battle of Soissons in 486; many historians consider this Clovis' greatest victory. Syagrius fled to the Visigothic king Alaric II, but the Franks threatened war if Syagrius were not surrendered to them. Syagrius was sent back to Clovis, who had him executed in 486 or 487. thumbThe Kingdom of Soissons was a remnant of the Roman Empire within Gaul surrounded by newly established Germanic kingdoms. Clovis I ruled the Franks until his death in 511. When he died, the Frankish realm was divided into four kingdoms, one for each of his sons. Clotaire I received the area formerly ruled by Syagrius. (Clotaire himself had been born in Soissons a decade after Syagrius' death.) By skillful diplomacy, warmongering, and murder of his relatives, Clotaire became the king of all Gaul by 555. When Clotaire died in 561, the Frankish realm was divided into three kingdoms, one for each son. The western kingdom of Neustria continued to be governed from Soissons until all Franks were once more unified under the Neustrian king Clotaire II in 613. Except for the period of 639-673, when a division between Neustria and Austrasia occurred, the Franks remained unified until the Treaty of Verdun in 843. Army left When Aegidius was appointed magister militum of Gaul by Emperor Majorian, he took control of the remaining Roman troops in Gaul. According to Eastern Roman writer Priscus, Aegidius and Syagrius both commanded \\"large forces\\". At one point, Aegidius and/or Syagrius even threatened the Western Roman Empire with an invasion of Italy if the empire did not grant their requests. Their forces also offered effective resistance to the power of the Visigoth Kingdom, to the south and west of Soissons. There are however no figures available that make it possible to come to a judgement on the total strength of their troops.

A series of 65 aircraft were built and most were used by the Polish Air Force observation squadrons during World War II in 1939. Design and development The aircraft was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement of 1933 for a new army cooperation plane, a successor of the Lublin R-XIII. The RWD team of the DWL workshops (Do≈õwiadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) initially proposed the RWD-12 project, based on the RWD-8 trainer. It was however considered as not as good as the R-XIII, and was not built. Another aircraft, the RWD-14 was designed by Stanislaw Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki instead.Glass A.

(2014), p.12 It won the contest over the Lublin R-XXI project and the PWS factory project, but factory trials showed that its performance was still not satisfactory. In 1937 two modified prototypes were built, designated RWD-14a, but both crashed during trials that year due to steering mechanism faults (the pilots survived). Finally, in early 1938 the fourth improved prototype, designated RWD-14b, was built. After successful trials it was ordered by the Polish Air Force, receiving the name Czapla (Polish: heron), but due to a long development process, it was regarded as only an interim model, to replace the R-XIII until the advent of the more modern LWS-3 Mewa. In return for refunding the development costs, the DWL gave the rights to produce the RWD-14b to the state factory LWS (Lubelska Wytw√≥rnia Samolot√≥w ‚Äì Lublin Aircraft Works, a successor of the Plage i La≈õkiewicz). The LWS built a series of 65 RWD-14b Czapla by February 1939. They were also known under a military designation LWS Czapla. Operational history A wrecked RWD-14b in September 1939 The Czapla entered service in the Polish Air Force in the spring of 1939, equipping some observation squadrons (eskadra obserwacyjna). Due to its long development, it was not a modern aircraft, only a little better than the Lublin R-XIII. Its advantage was its short take-off (140 m) and landing (120 m), enabling it to operate from fields and meadows. Its modern successor, the LWS-3 Mewa, did not manage to enter operational units due to the war.Morga≈Ça. A (2003), pp. 210 By the invasion of Poland in 1939, the Polish Air Force had 35 Czaplas in five observation squadrons (out of twelve): No.'s 13, 23, 33, 53 and 63, each with seven aircraft. Squadrons were distributed among the field Armies. The remaining 30 Czaplas were initially in reserve. Several were used to supplement the combat units during the campaign (the mentioned squadrons and several others). In total, 49 Czaplas were used in units.Morga≈Ça. A (2003), pp. 201‚Äì205 Like the R-XIII, the Czapla was no match for any Luftwaffe fighter, bomber, or even reconnaissance aircraft, being much slower, and armed with only two machine guns. In spite of this, they were actively used for close reconnaissance and liaison tasks. Most ‚Äì 35 RWD-14b were destroyed during the campaign. At least 14 were withdrawn to Romania (the sources quote numbers from 14 to 17). They were taken over by the Romanian Air Force and used for training and auxiliary duties.

Although the aquarium was highly successful and the attendance was high for years, after the 9/11 tragedy in 2001, the number of visitors fell drastically within a few months, and the aquarium failed to meet its attendance projections of over a million visitors per year, in part because of a downturn in the U.S. economy. The aquarium was not able to make payments on its high construction debt, and Colorado Ocean Journey Liquidation Inc. filed bankruptcy April 2002 with a $62.5 million debt. After a last- minute bidding war with Ripley's Entertainment, Landry's Restaurants, Inc. purchased the facility in March 2003 for $13.6 million. After the purchase, the facility remained open to the public until the summer of 2005, when it closed briefly for renovations. These included the addition of a full-service restaurant, bar, and ballroom. A marine aquarium was added to the restaurant area. Upon its reopening July 14, 2005, the facility was renamed Downtown Aquarium. Exhibits North America exhibit area A major theme for this landlocked aquarium is the relationship between inland freshwater ecosystems and the ocean. The original design of the aquarium was zoogeographic. It focused on the path to the ocean taken by two rivers, the Colorado River in North America and the Kampar River in Indonesia. The Colorado River Journey included exhibits of endangered fish, including desert pupfish; gamefish such as bass; and northern river otters, among other species. It ended with a large exhibit depicting the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California), into which the actual Colorado River empties. The Indonesia River Journey included exhibits of animals such as Asian arowanas, rainbowfish, and endangered Sumatran tigers, among other species. It ended with a large exhibit depicting the southern Pacific Ocean. In addition to these two journeys, the aquarium housed a large sea otter exhibit. After the 2005 renovations, the two journey paths remain, but are no longer arranged in a strictly zoogeographic pattern. For example, tanks on the second pathway (formerly the Kampar River Journey) depict African and South American freshwater ecosystems; other tanks are mixed community aquaria. The sea otter exhibit was removed to make room for the restaurant tank. The facility features several interactive exhibits, including a horseshoe crab touch tank and a stingray touch-and-feed tank. The aquarium continues to focus on conservation. To that end, it houses numerous endangered or threatened species: 12 species of fish, six of reptiles, two of mammals, and two of birds. It participates in the AZA's Species Survival Plan for Sumatran tigers. Education A volunteer program administered by the Deep Blue Sea Foundation, a nonprofit group, is in place. The Deep Blue Sea Foundation was formed after Landry's purchased the aquarium to ensure the educational goals of the original founders would continue to be met. The aquarium also periodically hosts for-cost educational seminars.

They were introduced in , where a number of applications are given, including results on Schur multipliers. Powerful p-groups are used in the study of automorphisms of p-groups , the solution of the restricted Burnside problem , the classification of finite p-groups via the coclass conjectures , and provided an excellent method of understanding analytic pro-p-groups . Formal definition A finite p-group G is called powerful if the commutator subgroup [G,G] is contained in the subgroup G^p = \\\\langle g^p  g\\\\in G\\\\rangle for odd p, or if [G,G] is contained in the subgroup G^4 for p=2. Properties of powerful p-groups Powerful p-groups have many properties similar to abelian groups, and thus provide a good basis for studying p-groups. Every finite p-group can be expressed as a section of a powerful p-group. Powerful p-groups are also useful in the study of pro-p groups as it provides a simple means for characterising p-adic analytic groups (groups that are manifolds over the p-adic numbers): A finitely generated pro-p group is p-adic analytic if and only if it contains an open normal subgroup that is powerful: this is a special case of a deep result of Michel Lazard (1965). Some properties similar to abelian p-groups are: if G is a powerful p-group then: * The Frattini subgroup \\\\Phi(G) of G has the property \\\\Phi(G) = G^p. * G^{p^k} = \\\\\\\\{g^{p^k}g\\\\in G\\\\\\\\} for all k\\\\geq 1. That is, the group generated by pth powers is precisely the set of pth powers. * If G = \\\\langle g_1, \\\\ldots, g_d\\\\rangle then G^{p^k} = \\\\langle g_1^{p^k},\\\\ldots,g_d^{p^k}\\\\rangle for all k\\\\geq 1. * The kth entry of the lower central series of G has the property \\\\gamma_k(G)\\\\leq G^{p^{k-1}} for all k\\\\geq 1. * Every quotient group of a powerful p-group is powerful. * The Pr√ºfer rank of G is equal to the minimal number of generators of G. Some less abelian-like properties are: if G is a powerful p-group then: * G^{p^k} is powerful. * Subgroups of G are not necessarily powerful.

Trigonellites latus and described as a bivalve) from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation in England An aptychus is a type of marine fossil. It is a hard anatomical structure, a sort of curved shelly plate, now understood to be part of the body of an ammonite. Paired aptychi have, on rare occasions, been found at or within the aperture of ammonite shells. The aptychus was usually composed of calcite, whereas the ammonite shell was aragonite. Aptychi can be found well- preserved as fossils, but usually quite separate from ammonite shells. This circumstance led to them being initially classified as valves of bivalves (clams), which they do somewhat resemble. Aptychi are found in rocks from the Devonian period through to those of the Cretaceous period. There are many forms of aptychus, varying in shape and in the sculpture of the inner and outer surfaces. However, because they are so rarely found in position within the ammonite shell, it is often unclear which kind of aptychus belonged to which species of ammonite. When only a single plate is present, as is sometimes the case, the term \\"anaptychus\\" is used. Function Aptychi seem to have most often existed as bilaterally-symmetrical pairs, and were first described (incorrectly) as being the valves of bivalve mollusks. Aptychi are now considered to be a two-valved closing hatch on the shells of extinct ammonites or a double-plate jaw-piece similar to that of some modern cephalopods.Morton, N. 1981.

Set near to or against the shell's terminal opening (the living chamber), the aptychi usually consisted of two identical but mirror image valves. Some authors consider the aptychus to be a jaw apparatus (mandibles), while others believe them to be paired opercula. If the latter is the case, then aptychi may have had a function similar to the head shield of modern nautiluses.

Church Assembly: 1919 to 1970  Before 1919, any change to the Church's worship or governance had to be by Act of Parliament, which resulted in little being done.Garbett, Cyril. The Claims of the Church of EnglandHodder & Stoughton:1947, pp.192f In 1919, the Convocations of the Provinces of Canterbury and York adopted the constitution of the National Church Assembly proposed by the Representative Church Council and presented it to the King as an appendix to an address. The constitution as proposed to the Sovereign was then recognised as already existing in the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 thus obtaining legal recognition of the Assembly without implying that it had been created by Parliament or that Parliament could modify its constitution.Iremonger, F.A. William Temple, OUP:1948, p.273 By means of the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 Parliament then gave the Assembly power to prepare Measures which, once presented to Parliament and approved by a special procedure (see below), were to \\"have the force and effect of an Act of Parliament\\" on \\"any matter concerning the Church of England\\", and included the power to repeal or amend Acts of Parliament concerning the Church.Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 (1919 c.76 9 and 10 Geo 5) on the UK Statute Law Database website ‚Äì retrieved 9 May 2008 The preparation of such measures lay mainly with a joint Legislative Committee of the three houses of the Assembly and this Committee negotiated with the parliamentary Ecclesiastical Committee to reach an agreed form.Neill, Stephen.

Biography =Early life= Salt, the son of Thomas Salt who was a physician and Alice n√©e Butt, was born in Lichfield on 14 June 1780. He was the youngest of eight children and went to school in Lichfield, Market Bosworth, and then in Birmingham under where his brother John Butt Salt taught. He took an early interest in portrait painting. While in Lichfield, he studied under a watercolour artist, John Glover, and in 1789, he went to London where he first studied under Joseph Farington and later under John Hoppner. After a time, he gave up portrait painting, having failed to build up a reputation. =Early travels= Salt found a position with the English nobleman George Annesley, Viscount Valentia, travelling as his secretary and draughtsman, recommended by Thomas Simon Butt. They started on an eastern tour in June 1802, sailing on the British East India Company's chartered ship Minerva to India via the Cape Colony. Salt explored the Cape of Good Hope, India, and the Red Sea area. Valentia came to describe Salt as a \\"secretary-draftsman\\": he was not only a companion, but also sketched the sites and scenes they encountered on their voyage. In 1805, Valentia sent Salt on a journey into the Abyssinian area (now Ethiopia) to meet with Wolde Selassie, Ras of Tigray to open up trade relations on behalf of the English. While visiting there, Salt gained the respect of the Selassie. He returned to England on 26 October 1806. His journey home took him through Egypt where he met the Pasha Mehmet Ali. Salt's paintings from the trip were used in Valentia's Voyages and Travels to India, published in 1809. The originals of all the drawings were kept by Valentia, as also the copper plates after Salt's death. The format and style of the plates is similar to Thomas and William Daniell's work, \\"Oriental Scenery\\" (1795-1808). Salt returned to Ethiopia in 1809 on a government mission to develop trade and diplomatic links with the Ethiopian Emperor Egwale Seyon. Upon arrival, he was unable to meet with the king due to unrest in the country, so instead he went to stay with his friend the Ras Wolde Selassie. During this venture, Salt took on the side mission of verifying and correcting the information about the region reported by the Scottish traveler, James Bruce many years earlier. Salt came back to England in 1811 with numerous specimens of both plants and animals. Most notable was a species of dik-dik that was previously unknown to the people of England. He would go on to publish in 1814, A voyage to Abyssinia, and travels into the interior of that country, executed under the orders of the British government in the years 1809 & 1810, whose contents were on the culture, geography, customs, and topography of Ethiopia. He also published a collection of drawings entitled Twenty-four Views Taken in St Helena, The Cape, India, Ceylon, Abyssinia and Egypt. He later returned and continued a friendship with the Ethiopian warlord Sabagadis. =Consul General in Egypt= Through his book and details of exploration, Salt had earned himself a name in the British government and when an opening for the Consul General of Egypt opened up in 1815, Salt was recommended to the position by Lord Valentia and appointed to be the Consul General in Egypt. In 1816, he arrived in Alexandria and traveled to Cairo where he would be stationed as consul. Once set up in Cairo, he began to work on his mission of securing antiquities and artifacts for the British Museum. In order to successfully do this, he believed that he must first be on good terms with the ruler of Egypt, the Pasha Mohamed Ali (aka Mehemet Ali). Salt was able to foster beneficial relations between the British government and Ali acting as a middle man, negotiating deals concerning trade and territorial rights, earning him the affection of Ali. Ali was able to provide Salt with a good residence in the city and a place in his court in return for his help in negotiations. He also sponsored the excavations of Thebes and Abu Simbel, personally carrying out significant archaeological research at the pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx which earned him praise from Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion for his ability to decipher hieroglyphs. In 1825 Mr. Salt published, at his own expense, Essay on Dr. Young's and M. Champollion's System of Hieroglyphics; with some additional discoveries, by which it may be applied to decipher the names of the ancient kings of Egypt and Ethiopia. Furthermore, in his tenure as Consul General, Mr. Salt devoted himself to the task of assembling a collection of antiquities, although he was hindered in every possible way by Bernardino Drovetti, who, having been dismissed from his official post, now had the time personally to supervise the search of antiquities around the country. Drovetti had great advantages over his British rival because of his thorough knowledge of Egypt, where he had been living for many years by this time, and also thanks to his close friendship with the Pasha, Muhammad Ali of Egypt. But Salt was not easily discouraged and resorting to the same methods as his rival, he surrounded himself with agents who would not stop for anything. The year he arrived in Cairo he had the good fortune to meet both Giovanni Battista Belzoni, an extraordinary individual who immediately became his main agent, and Giovanni D‚ÄôAthanasi, a Greek known as Yanni, who worked for him in the Thebes area from 1817 to 1827. Thanks to his assistants, Salt was able to begin selling his artifacts in just two years. = Death = Henry Salt died at the age of 47 on 30 October 1827 in the village of Desuke in Egypt. He was buried in Alexandria where he was stationed as Consul General. His paintings, papers, and artifacts he collected remain in the possession of the British Museum.  Work and contributions to Egyptology  = Collections = His first collection contained artifacts and pieces that Salt acquired from 1816 ‚Äì 1818. When shipped to England and evaluated by specialists, the total value of the collection was estimated to be approximately ¬£8000, although it would be sold for much less. Records show that the collection ended up being sold in February 1823. The sarcophagus of Seti I, a major piece of the collection was bought by the British architect Sir John Soane for ¬£2000 and the rest was bought by the British Museum for the same price. Following the assembly of his first collection, Salt began acquiring what would be known as his second collection, containing items he collected from 1819 ‚Äì 1824. While Salt's primary intention was to sell to the British Museum again, this time for a yearly pension of ¬£600 for his service as the Consul, it would ultimately be rejected due to the price. Despite the British concerns over price, the French royalty wanted to buy the collection and display it at the Louvre, which they did in 1826 for a total of ¬£10,000. Salt would spend the rest of his life putting together a third collection which featured his antiquities acquired from 1825 to his death in 1827. This collection was sold years after his death when an agent of his sold it to the British Museum for over ¬£7000. = Notable artifacts = Head of Ramses II (Young Memnon) * Sarcophagus of Seti I * Head and arm of Thothmes III * Mummy of Hornedjitef * Sarcophagus of Ramesses III * Head and supporting Left Arm of Amenhotep III * Head and upper torso of monumental limestone statue of Amenhotep III wearing nemes. * Granodiorite seated statue of Amenhotep III. * Granodiorite statue of Amenhotep III.

It attempts to avoid complex vocabulary. It attempts to be free of clich√©s and needless technical jargon, and should be appropriate to the audience's developmental or educational level and their familiarity with the topic. The term is commonly used when discussing government or business communication. Etymology The term derives from the 16th-century idiom \\"in plain English\\", meaning \\"in clear, straightforward language\\". Another name for the term, layman's terms, is derived from the idiom \\"in layman's terms\\" which refers to language phrased simply enough that a layperson, or common person, can understand. History =United Kingdom= In 1946, writer George Orwell wrote an essay entitled, \\"Politics and the English Language\\", where he criticized the dangers of \\"ugly and inaccurate\\" contemporary written English. The essay focuses particularly on politics where pacification can be used to mean \\"...defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets...\\". In 1948, HM Treasury asked Sir Ernest Gowers to provide a guide to officials on avoiding pompous and over-elaborate writing. He wrote, \\"writing is an instrument for conveying ideas from one mind to another; the writer's job is to make his reader apprehend his meaning readily and precisely.\\" Gowers' guide was published as a slim paperback Plain Words, a guide to the use of English in 1948, followed by a sequel The ABC of Plain Words in 1951, and a hardback book combining the best of both, The Complete Plain Words, in 1954 ‚Äì which has never been out of print since. Gowers argued that legal English was a special case, saying that legal drafting: There is a trend toward plainer language in legal documents. Plain English Campaign has been campaigning since 1979 \\"against gobbledygook, jargon and misleading public information.\\" The campaign has helped many government departments and other official organisations with their documents, reports and publications. They believe that everyone should have access to clear and concise information.\\" The 1999 \\"Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts\\" regulations mandate \\"plain and intelligible\\" language. An inquiry into the 2005 London bombings recommended that emergency services should always use plain English. It found that verbosity can lead to misunderstandings that could cost lives. =Ireland= The National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA). is the national leader in plain English training and provision in Ireland. Since 2005, NALA has supported organisations and government departments to use plain English through its training, style guides and editing work. In 2019, NALA saw its lobbying work pay off when a Draft Plain Language Act (2019) received cross party support, but Brexit discussions and then COVID-19 put the draft act on hold. NALA and other plain English advocates hope that the draft Act is enacted soon. Meanwhile, NALA continues to support domestic and international efforts to make information accessible to all (particularly those with literacy and numeracy needs). In early 2020, NALA developed an A-Z plain English guide to COVID-19 terms and continues to provide support and advise to those who wish to improve the quality and clarity of their information. It is also a keen supporter of, and contributor to, the evolving international plain language standards. =United States= In the US, the plain language movement in government communication started in the 1970s. The Paperwork Reduction Act was introduced in 1976, and in 1978 President Carter issued executive orders intended to make government regulations \\"cost-effective and easy-to-understand by those who were required to comply with them.\\" Many agencies now have long- standing policies mandating plain language; in 2010, this was made a federal requirement with the Plain Writing Act. In legal writing, David Mellinkoff, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, is widely credited with singlehandedly launching the plain English movement in American law with the 1963 publication of The Language of the Law. In 1977, New York became the first state to pass legislation requiring plain English in consumer contracts and leases. In 1979, Richard Wydick published Plain English for Lawyers. Plain English writing style is now a legal duty for companies registering securities under the Securities Act of 1933, due to rules the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted in 1998. In 2011, PLAIN (Plain Language Action and Information Network) published Federal Plain Language Guidelines.PDF (118 p.) Linguist and law school professor, Peter Tiersma, wrote an article titled Instructions to jurors: Redrafting California‚Äôs jury instructions in The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics in 2010. He outlines the history of legal trials and how pattern jury instructions were developed in order to create an atmosphere in which jurors are given pertinent information to a case in order to determine factual evidence and guilt of an accused individual. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s in California, a panel comprising judges and lawyers drafted pattern jury instructions. These standardized jury instructions were problematic, as they were written using technical language rather than in Plain English. In the late 1970s, Robert and Veda Charrow studied jury instructions for comprehensibility, where individuals were asked to verbally summarize pattern jury instructions. The participants accounted for only one-third of pertinent information given in the jury instructions. The Charrows further identified linguistic features of these instructions that made instructions given to member of a jury difficult to understand. After revising the instructions to include a more recognized vocabulary, comprehension rose 47%. Tiersma provides examples of jury instructions in both Legal English and Plain English. In the Book of Approved Jury Instructions, or BAJI, instructions regarding the care of motorists when operating a motor vehicle read: Tiersma points out several confusing terms and formal jargon used in this definition that would be difficult for jury participants to understand. He highlights \\"to use like care\\" as being overly formal and \\"pedestrian\\" as being atypically defined including individuals using wheelchairs and \\"motorized quadrangles.\\" The California Jury Instructions: Criminal or CACI, rework these instructions and read: The CACI instructions are in common language and are more direct. Jury instructions that are more direct have been criticized, saying that utilizing a more recognizable vocabulary would make the instructions less precise in a legal atmosphere.

Alphonse and Gaston is an American comic strip by Frederick Burr Opper, featuring a bumbling pair of Frenchmen with a penchant for politeness. It first appeared in William Randolph Hearst's newspaper, the New York Journal on September 22, 1901, with the title \\"Alphonse a la Carte and His Friend Gaston de Table d'Hote\\".Alphonse and Gaston at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 4, 2012. The strip was later distributed by King Features Syndicate. Moses Koenigsberg, King News: An Autobiography. New York, F.A. Stokes Company, 1941 (p.449 ) Characters and story Their \\"'After you, Alphonse.', 'No, you first, my dear Gaston!'\\" routine ran for more than a decade. Alphonse is short and grotesque; Gaston is tall and grotesque. The premise is that both are extremely polite, constantly bowing and deferring to each other. Neither can ever do anything or go anywhere because each insists on letting the other precede him. Though never a daily or even weekly feature, Alphonse and Gaston appeared on Sundays for several years. In addition to Hearst collections and licensed products, it was adapted into a stage play and several comedy shorts. Crossovers A prolific artist and writer, Opper's other creations included Willie, Hans from Hamburg, Our Antediluvian Ancestors, And Her Name Was Maud and Happy Hooligan. The characters would occasionally make guest appearances outside their own strips. On one occasion, And Her Name Was Maud featured an appearance by Alphonse and Gaston aboard a runaway sleigh, each of them bowing to the other in the seat. Legacy The strip faded from public view shortly after Opper's death in 1937, but the catchphrase \\"After you, my dear Alphonse\\" persisted. The phrase \\"Alphonse-and-Gaston routine\\", or \\"Alphonse-Gaston Syndrome\\", indicates a situation wherein one party refuses to act until another party acts first. From a September 23, 2009, New York Times editorial: \\"For years, China and the United States have engaged in a dangerous Alphonse- and-Gaston routine, using each other‚Äôs inaction to shirk their responsibility.\\" Alphonse and Gaston exchanges have also been employed by sportscasters during baseball broadcasts when two outfielders go after the ball and it falls in for a base hit. Also, the phrase has a specific meaning in baseball lingo: when two fielders allow a catchable ball to drop between them, it is known as ‚Äúdoing the Alphonse and Gaston.‚Äù The 1909 short farce- comedy Alphonse and Gaston by Frank Dumont is based around the characters.

They are stationary and silent, usually in costume, carefully posed, with props and/or scenery, and may be theatrically lit. It thus combines aspects of theatre and the visual arts. A tableau may either be 'performed' live, or depicted in painting, photography and sculpture, such as in many works of the Romantic, Aesthetic, Symbolist, Pre-Raphaelite, and Art Nouveau movements. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tableaux sometimes featured ('flexible poses') by virtually nude models, providing a form of erotic entertainment, both on stage and in print. Tableaux continue to the present day in the form of living statues, street performers who busk by posing in costume.  Origin  Occasionally, a Mass was punctuated with short dramatic scenes and painting- like . They were a major feature of festivities for royal weddings, coronations and royal entries into cities. Often the actors imitated statues or paintings, much in the manner of modern street entertainers, but in larger groups, and mounted on elaborate temporary stands along the path of the main procession.Festivals in Valois France British Library, accessed September 24th, 2007 Johan Huizinga, in The Autumn of the Middle Ages, describes the use and design of tableaux vivants in the late middle ages. The history of Western visual arts in general, until the modern era, has had a focus on symbolic, arranged presentation, and (aside from direct personal portraiture) was heavily dependent on stationary artists' models in costume ‚Äì essentially small-scale with the artist as temporary audience. The Realism movement, with more naturalistic depictions, did not begin until the mid-19th century, a direct reaction against Romanticism and its heavy dependence on stylized format. On stage Postcard with Olga Desmond Sch√∂nheitsabende Before radio, film and television, were popular forms of entertainment, even in frontier towns. Before the age of color reproduction of images, the was sometimes used to recreate artworks on stage, based on an etching or sketch of a painting. This could be done as an amateur venture in a drawing room, or as a more professionally produced series of presented on a theatre stage, one following another, usually to tell a story without requiring all the usual trappings and production of a full theatre performance. They thus influenced the form taken by later Victorian and Edwardian era magic lantern shows, and perhaps also sequential narrative comic strips (which first appeared in modern form in the late 1890s). were often performed as the basis for school Nativity plays in England during the Victorian period; the custom is still practised at Loughborough High School (believed to be one of England's oldest grammar schools for girls). Several are performed each year at the school carol service, including the depiction of an engraving (in which the subjects are painted and dressed completely grey). Theatrical censorship in Britain and the United States forbade actresses to move when nude or semi-nude on stage, so had a place in risqu√© entertainment for many years. In the early 1900s, German dancer Olga Desmond appeared in Sch√∂nheitsabende ('Evenings of Beauty') in which she posed nude in \\"living pictures\\", imitating classical works of art. In the nineteenth century, took such titles as \\"Nymphs Bathing\\" and \\"Diana the Huntress\\" and were to be found at such places as the Hall of Rome in Great Windmill Street, London. Other venues were the Coal Hole in the Strand and the Cyder Cellar in Maiden Lane. Nude and semi-nude were also a frequent feature of variety shows in the US: first on Broadway in New York City, then elsewhere in the country. The Ziegfeld Follies featured such from 1917. The Windmill Theatre in London (1932‚Äì1964) featured nude on stage; it was the first, and for many years the only, venue for them in 20th-century London. were often included in fairground sideshows (as seen in the 1961 film A Taste of Honey). Such shows had largely died out by the 1970s. remain a major attraction at the annual Pageant of the Masters in Laguna Beach, California. Photographic tableaux Jean-Fran√ßois Chevrier was the first to use the term in relation to a form of art photography, which began in the 1970s and 1980s in an essay titled \\"The Adventures of the Picture Form in the History of Photography\\" in 1989. The initial translation of this text substitutes the English word picture for the French word . However Michael Fried retains the French term when referring to Chevrier's essay, because according to Fried (2008), there is no direct translation into English for in this sense. While picture is similar, \\"... it lacks the connotations of constructedness, of being the product of an intellectual act that the French word carries.\\" (p. 146) Other texts and Clement Greenberg's theory of medium specificity also cover this topic. The key characteristics of the contemporary photographic according to Chevrier are, firstly: > They are designed and produced for the wall. summoning a confrontational > experience on the part of the spectator that sharply contrasts with the > habitual processes of appropriation and projection whereby photographic > images are normally received and \\"consumed\\" (p. 116) By this, Chevrier notes that scale and size is obviously important if the pictures are to \\"hold the wall\\". But size has another function; it distances the viewer from the object, requiring one to stand back from the picture to take it all in. This \\"confrontational\\" experience, Fried notes, is actually quite a large break from the conventional reception of photography, which up to that point was often consumed in books or magazines. The photographic has its roots not in the theatrical , but in pictorialist photography, such as that of Alfred Stieglitz, a movement with its roots in Aestheticism, which already made heavy use of the as a non-theatrical visual art style. Pictorialism, according to Jeff Wall could be seen as an attempt by photographers to imitate painting (perhaps unsuccessfully): > Pictorialist photography was dazzled by the spectacle of Western painting > and attempted, to some extent, to imitate it in acts of pure composition. > Lacking the means to make the surface of its pictures unpredictable and > important, the first phase of Pictorialism, Stieglitz's phase, emulated the > fine graphic arts, re-invented the beautiful look, set standards for > gorgeousness of composition, and faded. (p. 75) However photography did have the ability to unpredictable and spontaneous. This was achieved by making photographs related to the inherent capabilities of the camera itself. And this, Wall argues, was a direct result of photojournalism, and the mass media and pop culture industries. > By divesting itself of the encumbrances and advantages inherited from older > art forms, reportage, or the spontaneous fleeting aspect of the photographic > image pushes toward a discovery of qualities apparently intrinsic to the > medium, qualities that must necessarily distinguish the medium from others > and through the self-examination of which it can emerge as a modernist art > on a plane with others. (pp. 76‚Äì78) The argument is that, unlike most other art forms, photography can profit from the capture of chance occurrences. Through this process ‚Äì the snapshot, the \\"accidental\\" image ‚Äì photography invents its own concept of the picture. A hybrid form of the \\"Western picture\\" (pictorialist photography) and the spontaneous snapshot. This is the stage whereby Wall argues that photography enters a \\"modernist dialectic\\". Wall states that unpredictability is key to modern aesthetics. This new concept of the picture, which Wall proposes, with the compositional aspects of the Western picture combined with the unpredictability that the camera affords through its shutter, can be seen in the work of many contemporary photographic artists including Luc Delahaye, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth, Irene Caesar, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia. The tableau as a form still dominates the art photography market. As Fried notes: \\"Arguably the most decisive development in the rise of the new art photography has been the emergence, starting in the late 1970s and gaining impetus in the 1980s and after, of what the French critic Jean-Fran√ßois Chevrier has called the \\"tableau form\\" (p. 143). However, there appears to be only a handful of young, emerging artists working within the tableau form. Examples include Florian Maier Aichen, Matthew Porter and Peter Funch. More recently, Canadian artist, Sylvia Grace Borda, has worked since 2013 to continue to stage tableaux for the camera within the Google Street View engine. Her work creates 360¬∞ immersive tableau vivant images for the viewer to explore. Through her efforts to pioneer the tableaux vivant for online exploration, she and her collaborator, John M. Lynch, won the Lumen Prize 2016 for Web Arts. = Film = The 1969 film, The Color of Pomegranates directed by Sergei Parajanov presents a loose biography of the Armenian poet Sayat Nova in a series of tableaux vivants of Armenian costume, embroidery and religious rituals depicting scenes and verses from the poet's life.

Life Balchin was born in Potterne, Wiltshire, the third and last child of William Edwin Balchin (1872-1958), a baker and teashop proprietor, later grocer, and Ada (n√©e Curtis), the daughter of a railway guard. His paternal grandfather, George Martin Balchin (1830-1898), of a line of wealthy Surrey farmers, was a farmer of 800 acres; his sudden decision in 1887 to cease work on his farm had a negative impact on the Balchin family's finances. At the age of eighteen months, Nigel knocked over a kettle of scalding water, and was so badly burned that he was not expected to survive. He was educated at Dauntsey's School and Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he took a scholarship and became a Prizeman in Natural Sciences. He then worked for the National Institute of Industrial Psychology between 1930 and 1935. For part of this time he was a consultant to JS Rowntree & Sons, where he was involved in the design and marketing of Black Magic chocolatesNigel Balchin, Derek Collett, Book and Magazine Collector, issue 301, December 2008.Rowntree's Cocoa Works, Making the Modern World study guide, The Science Museum and, he claimed, responsible for the success of the company's Aero and Kit Kat brands. He wrote for Punch magazine, published three non-fiction books as Mark Spade, and also wrote novels under his own name. During World War II he was a civil servant at the Ministry of Food, and then, on the basis of his pioneering work on personnel selection and scientific research, appointed Deputy Scientific Adviser to the Army Council, being promoted to the rank of brigadier at the early age of thirty-six. In 1956, he moved abroad to write screenplays in Hollywood and elsewhere, but was increasingly troubled by alcoholism, and returned permanently to England in 1962. He died in 1970 at a nursing home in Hampstead, London, and is buried on the edge of the north path in Hampstead Cemetery in north London. His gravestone is small, but distinctive, having the form of an open book. Writing His novels enjoyed great popular success for a time. Darkness Falls from the Air is set during the London Blitz and was written while the bombing was still in progress. The Small Back Room became a Powell and Pressburger film of the same title. A Way Through the Wood was adapted as a stage play, Waiting for Gillian, and as the 2005 film Separate Lies, which marked the directorial debut of Oscar-winning screenwriter Julian Fellowes. Other critically acclaimed Balchin novels include A Sort of Traitors, Sundry Creditors, The Fall of the Sparrow and Seen Dimly before Dawn. As a screenwriter he worked on an early draft of Cleopatra but is principally remembered for The Man Who Never Was, for which he won the 1957 BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay, and Mandy, the story of a deaf child. He also wrote the screenplay for The Singer Not the Song and adapted two of his own novels for the screen.

Burgess batted left-handed and threw right-handed.  Baseball career  Born in Caroleen, North Carolina, Burgess was signed as an amateur free agent by the Chicago Cubs in 1944. In , he led the Tri-State League with a .387 batting average. Burgess followed that by leading (minimum 100 games played) the Southern Association with a .386 average, in . He made his major league debut at the age of 22 with the Chicago Cubs on April 19, 1949. In October 1951, Burgess was traded to the Cincinnati Reds, who promptly traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for catcher Andy Seminick before the start of the 1952 season. With the Phillies, he platooned alongside the right-handed- hitting Stan Lopata. Burgess had his best season in 1954, when he had a .368 batting average in 108 games for the Phillies, earning his first All-Star Game selection. At the beginning of the 1955 season, Burgess was once again traded for Andy Seminick and returned to Cincinnati, where he finally got the chance to play every day. He rose to the occasion, hitting for a .306 batting average for the rest of the season along with 20 home runs and 77 runs batted in, gaining his second consecutive berth on the National League All-Star team. On July 29, 1955, Burgess hit three home runs and had nine runs batted in during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He began the 1956 season as the Reds' starting catcher, but when the team faltered early in the season, Reds manager Birdie Tebbetts decided to shake things up, and replaced Burgess with a younger man, Ed Bailey. In 1959, Burgess was traded along with Harvey Haddix and Don Hoak to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Frank Thomas, Whammy Douglas, Jim Pendleton and John Powers. He was the Pirates catcher on May 26, 1959 when Haddix took a perfect game into the 13th inning against the Milwaukee Braves, before losing the game. Burgess also won a World Series with the Pirates in 1960, batting .333 in the seven-game series. By 1963, Jim Pagliaroni had taken over as the Pirates' starting catcher and in late 1964, Burgess was acquired by the Chicago White Sox, who were in the middle of a heated pennant race. In his first plate appearance with the White Sox, on September 15, against the Detroit Tigers, he hit a game-tying home run off pitcher Dave Wickersham. Over the next three years, Burgess was used almost exclusively as a pinch hitter, appearing in just 7 games behind the plate. In , he set a Major League record which still stands for the most games in a season (79) by a non-pitcher who did not score a run. Burgess played his final major league game on October 1, 1967 at the age of 40.  Career statistics  During an 18-year major league career, Burgess played in 1,691 games, hitting for a .295 career batting average, with 126 home runs, 673 RBI, and a .362 on-base percentage. He accumulated 1,318 career hits, with 230 doubles, and 33 triples. His .295 career batting average ranked him 10th among Major League catchers, as of 2009. A six-time All-Star, Burgess led National League (NL) catchers in fielding percentage three times, in 1953, 1960, and 1961. He recorded a career .988 fielding percentage. His Major League record of 145 career pinch hits was broken by Manny Mota, in . Along with Curt Simmons, he was the last player to formally retire, who had played in the major leagues in the 1940s (not counting Minnie Mi√±oso, who un-retired twice).  Post-playing career  When his playing career ended, Burgess spent many years with the Atlanta Braves as a scout and minor league batting coach with the Pulaski Braves, in Pulaski, VA.

Christian missionaries have translated God as Gitche Manitou in scriptures and prayers in the Algonquian languages. Manitou is a common Algonquian term for spirit, mystery, or deity. Native American Churches in Mexico, United States and Canada often use this term. Anishinaabe In more recent Anishinaabe culture, the Anishinaabe language word Gichi-manidoo means Great Spirit, the Creator of all things and the Giver of Life, and is sometimes translated as the \\"Great Mystery\\". Historically, Anishinaabe people believed in a variety of spirits, whose images were placed near doorways for protection. According to Anishinaabeg tradition, Michilimackinac, later named by European settlers as Mackinac Island, in Michigan, was the home of Gitche Manitou, and some Anishinaabeg tribes would make pilgrimages there for rituals devoted to the spirit.\\"The Americas: International Dictionary of Historic Places; editors:Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson and Paul Schellinger. Routledge, Taylor & Francis; 1996; pg. 349. In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha, Gitche Manitou is spelled Gitche Manito. Other Anishinaabe names for God incorporated through the process of syncretism are Gizhe-manidoo (\\"venerable Manidoo\\"), Wenizhishid-manidoo (\\"Fair Manidoo\\") and Gichi-ojichaag (\\"Great Spirit\\"). While Gichi-manidoo and Gichi-ojichaag both mean \\"Great Spirit\\", Gichi-manidoo carried the idea of the greater spiritual connectivity while Gichi-ojichaag carried the idea of individual soul's connection to the Gichi- manidoo. Consequently, Christian missionaries often used the term Gichi- ojichaag to refer to the Christian idea of a Holy Spirit. Other tribes In addition to the Algonquian Anishinaabeg, many other tribes believed in Gitche Manitou. References to the Great Manitou by the Cheyenne and the Oglala Sioux (notably in the recollections of Black Elk), indicate that belief in this deity extended into the Great Plains, fully across the wider group of Algonquian peoples. Cognate terms recorded in other Algonquian languages include: ; Manitou *Sauk Fox: Mannittoo, God *Narragensett: Manitoo, God ; Gitche Manitou *Ojibwe: Gichi-manidoo *Ottawa: Gchi-mnidoo *Swampy Cree: Kihci-manit√¥ *Miami: Kihci Manetoowa *Lenape: Minsi: Kitschimanitto Unami: Ketan√´tuwit ( *Nanticoke (spoken in Maryland): Gichtschi Manitto ; Kishe Manitou *Ojibwe: Gizhe-manidoo *Ottawa: Gzhe-mnidoo *Swampy Cree: Kise-manit√¥ *Naskapi: Chisa-manitu *Illinois: Kisseh Manetou ; Other *Shawnee: Wishemenetou Gitche Manitou has been seen as those cultures' analogue to the Christian God. When early Christian (especially French Catholic) missionaries preached the Gospel to the Algonquian peoples, they adopted Gitche Manitou as a name for God in the Algonquian languages. This can be seen, for example, in the English translation of the \\"Huron Carol\\". Related spirits Spirits who were either aspects of Gitche Manitou or lesser spirits under Gitche Manitou include: *Hobomok, who was deemed more approachable than Gitche Manitou, and more likely to listen to pleas,Cypser, Cora E.

Manitou is one aspect of the interconnection and balance of nature and life, similar to the East Asian concept of qi. In simpler terms it can refer to a spirit. This spirit is seen as a person as well as a concept. Everything has its own manitou‚Äîevery plant, every stone and, since their invention, even machines. These manitous do not exist in a hierarchy like European gods/goddesses, but are more akin to one part of the body interacting with another and the spirit of everything; the collective is named Gitche Manitou.

In the strict sense of the term this means any film projector and therefore could include someone who operates the projector in a show. In common usage the term is generally understood to describe a paid employee of a movie theater. Projectionists are also known as \\"operators\\".The NickelodeonWayne Brittenden, The Celluloid Circus, New York, Random House (2008), p. 67. Historical background N.B. The dates given in the subject headings are approximate. =Early cinema (1895‚Äì1915)= The need for professional projectionists arose from the commercial showing of movie films to the general public in buildings specifically designed for the purpose or using variety theatres as part of the \\"bill\\", which began towards the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. Before the emergence of purpose-built movie theaters, film projectors in venues such as fairgrounds, music halls and Nickelodeons were usually operated by a showman or presenter, in the same way as a lanternist. The light source for most projectors in the early period was limelight, which did not require an electricity supply. Between approximately 1905 and 1915, two factors combined to transform the role of the projectionist into a separate job with a specific profile of skills and training. Concerns over the flammability of nitrate film, following several major fires during the cinema's first decade H. Mark Gosser, 'The Bazar de la Charit√© Fire: The Reality, The Aftermath and the Telling', Film History, vol. 10, no. 1 (1998), pp. 70-79. resulted in the increasing regulation of film exhibition, including the requirement that projectors be housed in fireproof booths, segregated from the auditorium. In the United Kingdom, for example, this requirement was introduced in the Cinematograph Act 1909, and effectively prevented the projectionist from also carrying out a public-facing role. The legal right to act as a projectionist in a public movie theater was, and to some extent still is, regulated, to varying degrees in different jurisdictions.Brittenden, p. 81. Some required projectionists to be licensed by local or central government,US Senate, bill no. 1183, session of 1981. and this process sometimes required projectionists to undergo assessments or sit exams. Trade union-based regulation of the profession was also widespread in some jurisdictions, in which the licensing of projectionists was incorporated into collective bargaining agreements between employers and unions. In the United States, projectionists were sometimes 'pooled out' to theatre companies via their union. Closed shop working by projectionists was common in British cinema chains until the early 1980s. The original reason for this regulation was the necessity for safety precautions for the screening of nitrate prints, and hence the requirement that projectionists should be formally trained to handle them to ensure public safety. But the formal training and licensing of projectionists continued in most of the US and Europe well after nitrate had been superseded in the 1950s, and in a minority of jurisdictions it still continues. Two projectors installed in a changeover configuration. The machine in the background will show the first reel, at the end of which the projectionist will 'change over' to reel 2, which is threaded on the projector in the foreground. If the procedure is performed correctly, the audience will be unaware that it has happened. =Classical period (1915‚Äì1953)= With the advent of feature-length films during the early to mid-teens and the increasing tendency for film screenings to be the main or only event that took place in a purpose-built theater, rather than incorporated into other forms of live entertainment, the role of the projectionist became more specialised and began to incorporate elements of showmanship once again. The safety precautions associated with nitrate required 35mm film prints to be shipped in reels no longer than 1,000 feet (approximately 15 minutes at 16fps). In order show a feature-length film without interruption while the following reel is laced up, two projectors focused on the same screen were used, with the projectionist 'changing over' from one to the other at the end of each reel. 2,000 foot 'double' reels were gradually introduced from the early 1930s onwards (approximately 20 minutes at the standardized sound speed of 24 fps). Until the conversion to sound, electric motors were relatively uncommon on 35mm theater projectors: most were hand-cranked by the projectionist. Contemporary accounts suggest that hand cranking at a consistent speed took a considerable amount of skill.F.H. Richardson, 'Theoretical vs. Practical as Applied to Standardisation', Journal of the SMPE, no. 6 (1918), pp. 33-35. Presentation technique also began to include tasks such as operating auditorium lighting systems [dimmers], curtains [side-tabs] and masking systems and lantern slide projectors.Brittenden, pp. 69-85. During the 1920s, movie theaters became larger and projection equipment had to adapt to this. Limelight illumination was replaced by the electrically powered carbon arc lamp, and with the arrival of sound electric motors were installed to drive projectors (a more constant speed was required for sound playback than could be achieved by hand cranking). The operation and basic maintenance of audio equipment also became part of the projectionist's job following the introduction of sound. =Post-classical period (1953‚Äìearly 1980s)= The projector inside the booth used by the projectionist The technology of cinema projection, and with it the role of the projectionist, changed fundamentally over an extended period between the early 1950s and late 1960s. Nitrate film was superseded by cellulose triacetate for release prints in the US and Europe over about a five-year period following the stock's commercial launch in October 1948 (though older nitrate prints remained in circulation for quite a long time afterwards and are still occasionally utilized in licensed cinemas for special screenings). With nitrate went the restrictions on reel lengths previously necessitated by the fire risk, with the result that systems were developed to enable the projection of a complete feature film using a single projector and unattended. Two essential technologies were needed to enable this: the long-play device, a.k.a. platter, i.e. a turntable 4‚Äì6 feet in diameter or (in the case of Sword Systems and Sabre Systems by EPRAD) an extremely large film reel 3‚Äì5 feet in diameter either of which enabled the reels of a feature presentation to be joined together into a single roll, in some cases up to 30,000 feet (approx. six hours at 24fps) in length; and the xenon arc lamp, which can burn continuously and unattended for as long as is needed (most carbon arc lamphouses will run for a maximum of 40‚Äì50 minutes before the carbon rod needs replacing, and require regular adjustment by the projectionist during that time). Automation systems were also introduced, which could be programmed in advance of each screening to perform functions such as operating auditorium lighting, adjusting volume levels and changing audio formats. Some would argue that these technologies reduced the skill level or downgraded the showmanship element of the projectionist's job (for example, by eliminating the need for changeovers and nitrate handling precautions). Others would argue that more advanced skills were needed in other areas. With the introduction of widescreen in the early 1950s, projectionists had to cope with the additional lenses, aperture plates and masking systems needed for different aspect ratios for the first time.John Belton, Widescreen Cinema, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press (1992), p. 108. Multiple channel audio systems using magnetic sound and 70mm film prints were also introduced in the 1950s, and these required specialist projection skills to handle. Like nitrate film prints, xenon arc bulbs require special safety precautions: if handled incorrectly they can explode,Video of a xenon arc bulb exploding, causing minor injuries to the projectionist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVpD8SWzKFM, retrieved 16 December 2010. causing serious injury to the projectionist. Staffing levels in projection booths decreased rapidly during this period. In the classical \\"movie palace\\", the labour-intensive nature of changeovers, carbon arc lamps and nitrate handling required large workforces of projectionists, with up to six or seven working in a single booth and a rigid management hierarchy within the profession being common. In contrast, the multiplexes of the 1980s and '90s were designed in such a way that a single projectionist can operate simultaneous screenings in 10-20 auditoria, and it is unusual for these venues to have a total projectionist workforce of more than three or four. =Final film period (early 1980s‚Äìpresent)= The view from a projectionist's booth at the Ultimate Palace Cinema in Oxford The job description of the projectionist began to vary considerably according to the type and location of theatre he or she worked in. In many of the multiplex theatre chains that emerged in the 1980s, the role of the projectionist was largely confined to assembling screening programs (consisting of a feature film print and other supporting material such as advertisements and trailers) onto a long-play platter or tower device, programming automation systems and very basic equipment maintenance such as cleaning film path components and the routine replacement of life-limited parts. More extensive maintenance and repairs are carried out by technicians employed centrally by the parent company and who visit its theatres to conduct maintenance on a regular cycle. In smaller chains and independent theaters, and especially those situated in geographically remote locations, projectionists are more likely to undertake more extensive maintenance and repair duties, both on a theater's projection and sound equipment and on other infrastructure in the building, e.g. heating and air conditioning plant. 35mm release prints continue to be shipped on 2,000 foot reels to the present day, even though very few theaters still present films using a two-projector system with changeovers. A number of attempts have been made over the years to introduce larger shipping reels for print distribution, but none has gained widespread acceptance.http://stason.org/TULARC/movies/production/5-4-1-Shipping- Configurations-for-35mm-Prints-manual-reel-c.html , retrieved 14 December 2010. =Future= Some larger theater chains are now in the process of eliminating the projectionist's job altogether.Regal Cinemas, Inc., Petitioner, v. National Labor Relations Board, Respondent., 317 F.3d 300 (D.C. Cir. 2003) - Federal Circuits - vLex () In order to avoid paying a higher wage rate and to circumvent skilled labor laws, some companies (such as Cinemark Theaters) use the job title \\"Booth Usher\\" for an employee who simply carries out basic screening operations and does not perform any program assembly, maintenance or repair procedures. Their starting wage is the same as that for popcorn concessionists and ushers ($7.84 per hour in Ohio as of August 2009).Cinemark Inc. Employee Handbook 2007 edition, pp. 7-8. Smaller theaters in this chain and those with union bargaining contracts that specify a minimum wage utilize management for these duties. In Britain, this started to happen early 2000 onward as labour laws were wiped out by then. The introduction of digital cinema projection, on a significant scale from approximately 2006 to 2008, is rapidly bringing to an end the role of the projectionist as a professionally skilled operator of film-based projection equipment in mainstream theatres. As of November 2010, the major chains in the US and Europe are in the process of a large-scale conversion to digital projection, in some ways comparable to the mass installation of sound equipment in the late 1920s and early 1930s. This has essentially been made possible by the virtual print feehttp://www.artsalliancemedia.com/vpf/documents/VPFQandA.pdf , retrieved 14 December 2010. model of financing the equipment and installation costs, in which studios and equipment manufacturers provide equipment to theatres on a hire-purchase basis.Digital Cinema Implementation Partners Announce Completion of $660 Million Financing for Digital Cinema (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-cinema-implementation- partners-announces-completion-of-660-million-financing-for-digital-cinema- upgrade-87249262.html) The basic operation of digital cinema servers and projectors requires little more than routine IT skills and can be performed by a theatre's front-of-house and managerial staff with minimal extra training. Within a few years, it is likely that projectionists, in the traditional sense of the word, will only be found in the small number of arthouse, cinematheque and repertory theatres that will continue to show film prints from archival collections. In May 2013, the BBC reported that by October 2013, \\"there will be no cinemas left in this country projecting 35mm\\".Report on the decline of film projection in cinemas, Today, BBC Radio Four, 29 May 2013, 0739-0745 hours. Elements of the job A projectionist in a modern theater in North America or Europe will typically carry out some or all of the following duties. =Film presentation= Receiving film prints delivered from the distributor and completing the shipping formalities. * Examining prints on a workbench to determine the image, sound format and other information needed to screen them correctly. * Examining prints to check for physical damage that could prevent the print from being screened without a breakdown, e.g. edge damage, split or strained perforations and defective splices. If there is a significant amount of dirt or scratching on the print, the projectionist may determine that it is of an unacceptably low quality for presentation and return it to the distributor for a replacement. * \\"Making up\\" the reels of a release print onto a long-play platter or tower device, complete with the supporting material in the screening program, e.g. advertisements, trailers and animated company logos or announcement snipes, for example asking members of the audience to switch off their mobile phones. * If the print is to be shown on a two-projector system, ensuring that the leaders and tails of each reel are spliced to the picture footage correctly and that the visual changeover cues are present. * Programming automation systems to perform presentation functions. This can sometimes take the form of placing self- adhesive cues on the film print in the desired location (e.g. when you want the house lights to be dimmed), which are then detected by an optical reader in the projector's film path. * Cleaning the surfaces in the projector's film path that come into contact with or proximity to the film surface. * \\"Lacing up\\" the film through the projector and film path to and from any long play device. * Carrying out presentation operations manually if an automation system is not in use. * \\"Taking down\\" the reels of a print and supporting programme after the final screening, and spooling them back into 2,000 foot lengths. * Dispatching film prints for return to the distributor, or sometimes a \\"crossover\\" direct to another theater, and completing the shipping formalities. =Maintenance and repair= Replacement of xenon arc bulbs at the end of their service life, and completing the shipping formalities for their return to the vendor for safe disposal. * Periodic adjustment of lamphouse reflectors to ensure even and optimum illumination. * Depending on the type of projector in use, maintenance of the mechanism, e.g. periodic draining and replacement of oil in the intermittent mechanism, and/or replacement of drive belts. * Periodic replacement of other life-limited parts of projection booth equipment, e.g. pressure plates and runners. * Periodic adjustment of the A-chain of the optical sound system, in order to ensure optimum focus and alignment. * Periodic adjustment of the motor control systems in a long-play device, in order to ensure optimum feed and take-up. * The regular projection of technical test films, e.g. the SMPTE's RP-40 and Dolby's \\"Jiffy\\"http://www.cinemaequipmentsales.com/dolby2.html , retrieved 10 December 2010 films, to evaluate the image and sound quality in the theater.

The strip first began publication in 1998 in New York's Next magazine. Stylistically, the strip is very much \\"of its time\\", reflecting the prevailing fashion for heaviness of line and a tendency to angularity. In terms of content and characterization, the strip bears some similarities to a 1970s and 1980s comic strip called Poppers, which was drawn by Jerry Mills, though both strips differ artistically. CharactersNathan: a 42-year-old widowed Jewish man. Nathan is portrayed as the \\"everyman\\" of the strip, is fairly short, and has a goatee. Though not made explicit, it appears from context that his late partner died of complications from AIDS. He also subsequently dated Steve, who worked in the World Trade Center and was killed in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. *Soir√©e: a flamboyant African-American man around 30 years old. Performs as a drag queen. Soir√©e was thrown out of his parents' house for being gay when he was a teenager, although he later reconciled with some family members at his father's funeral. Soir√©e's real name is Delroy Monroe, though his real name is never used by himself or most of the other characters. *Sky: a 22-year-old Canadian art student. Sky, the son of hippie parents, grew up on a commune. He tends toward being extremely optimistic (if slightly naive), and is cartoonishly well-built, resulting in his attracting a lot of attention from others, although he is often unaware of how attractive he is to both men and women; the gang also once walked in on Sky having sex with his lesbian friend and classmate Annie after returning from the pride parade. *Miss Marmelstein: Nathan's pet dog, named after Barbra Streisand's character in the Broadway play I Can Get It for You Wholesale. *Richard: Nathan's best friend. *Ruben: Richard's boyfriend. *Annie: Sky's friend and classmate. *Kelvin Cohen: a vain clothing designer; parody of Calvin Klein. He was also a former classmate of Nathan's at Hebrew school. *Chris: Sky's boyfriend. *Curtis: Soir√©e's boyfriend, a successful lawyer. *Ricki and Lucie: a lesbian couple who live in Nathan, Soir√©e and Sky's apartment building. Nathan served as a sperm donor in one storyline so that the couple could have a child (named Lindsay). *Risa: or Reese for short, Nathan's sister who divorces her husband near the end of the comic strip's run. She has two sons, Jason and Justin. Distribution New York's Next magazine is the lead carrier for the strip, which is also syndicated throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain and South Africa.

In this style of film, believable narratives and characters help convince the audience that the unfolding fiction is real. Lighting and camera movement, among other cinematic elements, have become increasingly important in these films. Great detail goes into the screenplays of narratives, as these films rarely deviate from the predetermined behaviours and lines of the classical style of screenplay writing to maintain a sense of realism. Actors must deliver dialogue and action in a believable way, so as to persuade the audience that the film is real life. General Probably the first fictional film ever made was the Lumi√®re's L'Arroseur arros√©, which was first screened at the Grand Caf√© Capucines on December 28, 1895.Alison McMahan, Alice Guy Blach√©, Lost Visionary of the Cinema (New York: Continuum, 2002) p. 13. A year later in 1896, Alice Guy-Blach√© directed the fictional film La fee aux choux.

M√©li√®s was one of the first directors to progress cinematic technology, which paved the way for narratives as style of film.Rosalind Leveridge, ‚ÄúFantastic voyages of the cinematic imagination: George M√©li√®s‚Äôs Trip to the Moon‚Äù Early Popular Visual Culture (May 2012), 10 (2), pg. 197-199 Narrative films have come so far since their introduction that film genres such as comedy or Western films, were, and continue to be introduced as a way to further categorize these films.Barsam, Richard Meran and Dave Monahan. Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film. New York: W.W. Norton &, 2010 Narrative cinema is usually contrasted to films that present information, such as a nature documentary, as well as to some experimental films (works such as Wavelength by Michael Snow, Man with a Movie Camera by Dziga Vertov, or films by Chantal Akerman). In some instances pure documentary films, while nonfiction, may nonetheless recount a story. As genres evolve, from fiction film and documentary a hybrid one emerged, docufiction. Many films are based on real occurrences, however these too fall under the category of a ‚Äúnarrative film‚Äù rather than a documentary. This is because films based on real occurrences are not simply footage of the occurrence, but rather hired actors portraying an adjusted, often more dramatic, retelling of the occurrence (such as 21 by Robert Luketic).Barsam, Richard Meran and Dave Monahan. Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film. New York: W.W. Norton &, 2010 Unlike literary fiction, which is typically based on characters, situations and events that are entirely imaginary/fictional/hypothetical, cinema always has a real referent, called the \\"pro-filmic\\", which encompasses everything existing and done in front of the camera. Since the emergence of classical Hollywood style in the early 20th century, during which films were selected to be made based on the popularity of the genre, stars, producers, and directors involved, narrative, usually in the form of the feature film, has held dominance in commercial cinema and has become popularly synonymous with \\"the movies.\\"Kaplan, E.

It was originally laid down in 1980 as BS 6008:1980 by the British Standards InstitutionRoyal Charter and Bye-laws, 1981, The British Standards Institution, and a revision was published in December, 2019 as ISO/NP 3103. It was produced by ISO Technical Committee 34 (Food products), Sub-Committee 8 (Tea). The abstract states the following: > The method consists in extracting of soluble substances in dried tea leaf, > contained in a porcelain or earthenware pot, by means of freshly boiling > water, pouring of the liquor into a white porcelain or earthenware bowl, > examination of the organoleptic properties of the infused leaf, and of the > liquor with or without milk, or both. This standard is not meant to define the proper method for brewing tea intended for general consumption, but rather to document a tea brewing procedure where meaningful sensory comparisons can be made. An example of such a test would be a taste-test to establish which blend of teas to choose for a particular brand or basic label in order to maintain a consistent tasting brewed drink from harvest to harvest. The work was the winner of the parodic Ig Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999. Details A white porcelain tea bowl To maintain consistent results, the following are recommendations given by the standard: * The pot should be white porcelain or glazed earthenware and have a partly serrated edge. It should have a lid that fits loosely inside the pot. * If a large pot is used, it should hold a maximum of 310 ml (¬±8 ml) and must weigh 200 g (¬±10 g). * If a small pot is used, it should hold a maximum of 150 ml (¬±4 ml) and must weigh 118 g (¬±10 g). * 2 grams of tea (measured to ¬±2% accuracy) per 100 ml boiling water is placed into the pot. * Freshly boiling water is poured into the pot to within 4‚Äì6 mm of the brim. Allow 20 seconds for water to cool. * The water should be similar to the drinking water where the tea will be consumed. * Brewing time is six minutes. * The brewed tea is then poured into a white porcelain or glazed earthenware bowl. * If a large bowl is used, it must have a capacity of 380 ml and weigh 200 g (¬±20 g). * If a small bowl is used, it must have a capacity of 200 ml and weigh 105 g (¬±20 g). * If the test involves milk, then it is added before pouring the infused tea unless that is contrary to the organisation's normal practice. * If milk is added after the pouring of tea, it is best added when the liquid is between 65-80¬∞C. * 5 ml of milk for the large bowl, or 2.5 ml for the small bowl, is used. Criticism The protocol has been criticized for omitting any mention of prewarming the pot. Ireland was the only country to object, and objected on technical grounds.

It was published in six issues by Fireman Press Ltd, a production company and publishing house. The issues were reprinted in trade paperback form by Image Comics in 2007. Many of the characters presented in the book were retooled for TenNapel's Nickelodeon cartoon series Catscratch. Gear featured black-and-white artwork mostly created with an ink brush by TenNapel. Many of its covers were photos of 3D sculptures, owing to TenNapel's affinity for stop motion animation. The Image Comics collection presents the artwork in full color. Plot Gear tells the story of a podunk town of squat, hominid- like cats who are bordered on all sides by bigger and more war-like animals. The town's only protection comes from an aged Guardian, a gigantic battle robot in disrepair. The town elder sends four brave cats out to capture an enemy guardian to further defend the town. The cats are named Waffle, Mr. Black, Simon, and Gordon. They were named after TenNapel's actual pet cats. After tragedy strikes the cats in a battle with the neighboring dog faction's guardian, causing the death of Simon, Waffle begins blaming himself for the trouble and goes into the woods to end his own life. There he meets Chee, an insect from another warring faction. The two befriend each other, little knowing of the role they will both play in the oncoming battles. The name \\"Gear\\" comes from a mystical artifact existing in the land which promises to greatly increase a Guardian's powers. Many parties search for the Gear, including a secret ninja-like Gear cult. The main plot revolves around the appearance of the gear and the subsequent mysteries it creates. Further themes in the story are the politics of the animal towns, the friendship of the four cats, the afterlife, and giant robot combat. Collected editions The six issues of the comic were reprinted as a trade paperback by Fireman Press at the end of the comic's initial run in 1999. The full color reprinting by Image Comics was printing in January 2007 () Television adaptation Gear was loosely adapted into a Nickelodeon cartoon series entitled Catscratch, though most elements from the comic book do not appear. The series main characters are Mr. Blik (changed from Mr. Black in the book), Gordon and Waffle. The characters of Simon and Gear do not appear, but the name Gear is used for Mr. Blik's beloved monster truck.

It is a free-to-air, general-entertainment channel, mainly focused on shows, movies and public-service messages; its direct competitor is Mediaset's Canale 5. Early history The first set of programming for Rai 1 was almost completely educational with no advertising, except for the popular Carosello. Early shows were meant to teach a common language to a country torn apart by World War II. Shows like Non √® mai troppo tardi... were simply shot in a classroom set and meant to help with reconstruction. While televisions were not widely available nor affordable, those who could spend the money on them became community leaders and often invited the neighborhood to visit. Bars and caf√©s turned from places where men would meet to argue or play cards into miniature cinemas where arguments over what show to watch would break out. Women and children were also more accepted inside the bars, as a result of the lack of men post-war and their need to enter working society. Churches also bought televisions are a means of drawing people to spend time as part of those communities. High-definition feed The channel launched an HDTV 1080i simulcast in September 2013, available nationwide on subscription-television providers and on DTT (channel 501).

Dick, first published in Orbit Science Fiction, No.2, in 1953. The story is told from the point of view of a young boy, Tony, living on an alien world that humans have conquered. The native species are beetle like creatures called the Pas-udenti, some of whom Tony has befriended. As news reaches the planet that the war has turned against the humans, Tony attempts to carry on his daily life, to disastrous effect. The conflicts in the story focuses on and are exacerbated by contradictions in Tony's existence and outlook. While opposed to the outright xenophobia displayed by his father, showing empathy towards the Pasudenti in the abstract context of 'The War', he has grown up ignorant of how he and his family are, to the native population forced to treat them as first-class citizens, still an active reminder of what he views as a far-off event. The story highlights the complexity and harm that can be caused by institutional racism and race relations. Tony, in interacting with the world around him is sympathetic to others, regardless of race, but his youth also blinds him to the fact that the status quo he longs to return to is a racist one where he is the primary beneficiary.

Overview In a pejorative manner, clericalism is often used to denote ecclesiolatry, that is, excessive devotion to the institutional aspects of an organized religion, usually over and against the religion's own beliefs or faith. This means that all issues, even those that may be beyond the religion's jurisdiction, must be addressed by either clergy or their supporters. Clericalism is also used to describe the cronyism and cloistered political environs of hierarchical religions, usually Christian denominational hierarchy, and mainly in reference to the Roman Catholic Church. The phenomenon of clericalism is not restricted to the ordained (e.g., priests, ministers), as it occurs in purely secular guilds, such as academia, the legal and medical establishments, and the public-safety clergy: the police and military.George B. Wilson, S.J. Clericalism: The Death of Priesthood. 2008. Liturgical Press, Collegeville MN USA Outside of Catholicism, clericalism is used to denote the divisions between ordained clergy and lay leaders in some Christian denominations while the older meaning of the term‚Äîan application of church-based theory or thought to secular issues‚Äîseems rather lost in most current uses of the term. In the aforementioned use of the term, it is important to discern the difference between a belief in a separation of church and state‚Äîwhich is not truly involving of clericalism‚Äîand the belief that church leadership should not be an internal and cloistered body that answers only to itself or that such leaders should not act as a powerful force in matters beyond the internal concerns of their church. Much debate in recent years over the sexual-abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church has brought about charges of clericalism in the sense of bishops and other leaders covering up the wrongdoing of clergy under their leadership. In this application of the term, clericalism has come to mean a division between ordained church leaders‚Äîthat such leaders have an exclusive society unto themselves‚Äîand the lay followers. Much debate over clericalism appears to dwell on whether the high clergy should have as much control over church offices and functions as they do, and whether the hierarchical and authoritarian nature of the traditional Catholic systems of promotion for clergy is effective in contemporary society. Again, while the Catholic Church is most commonly at the center of issues germane to clericalism, it is not the only denomination or religion in which charges of clericalism have been brought forth by those who feel the clergy has too much influence or should be reformed. Therefore, the debate over clericalism and anti-clericalism is often really a debate over how and by whom a religious organization (denomination) should be led and directed. In political history of various countries, distinctive radicalized forms of nationalistic clericalism or clerical nationalism (clero-nationalism or clerico-nationalism) were emerging on the far-right of the political spectrum, specially during the interwar period in the first half of 20th century.  Origin  \\"The reason that the 19th century French statesman L√©on Gambetta said that ‚Äúclericalism is the enemy‚Äù was because he saw freedom from ecclesial power as the principal objective in the battle for public freedom.\\"  Definition  Pope Francis in his address to the Synod Fathers at Synod2018 gave the following definition of clericalism: Toronto priest Fr. Thomas Rosica names and defines ‚Äúclericalism‚Äù with reference to Pope Francis, who he says uses ‚Äúclericalism‚Äù to mean a kind of ‚Äúecclesiastical narcissism,‚Äù as well as a ‚Äúclub mentality and a corrupt system of cronyism.‚Äù‚Äù Clericalism has also come to be regarded as a euphemism for acts connected with the abuse crisis such as homosexual pederasty and rape.

The review noted that \\"some of the riffs are beginning to sound a little tired and there is no great leap forward in terms of their musical ideas, but the sheer visceral force of their sound should please their dedicated fans\\". A review of the 2008 re-issue in Record Collector gave the album a five out of five star rating, stating that the album was as \\"close to flawless as metal gets, and a testament to the drive and talent of the much- missed Schuldiner\\". Metal-Rules.com ranked the album as the 7th greatest extreme metal album and the 58th greatest heavy metal album of all time.

The film revolves around a bachelor party that a group of men throw for their friend Rick Gassko (Hanks) on the eve of his wedding and whether he can remain faithful to his fianc√©e Debbie (Kitaen). Plot Party animal Rick Gassko (Tom Hanks), who makes his living as a Catholic-school bus driver, decides to settle down and marry his girlfriend Debbie Thompson (Tawny Kitaen). After learning the news of the engagement, Rick's shocked friends, led by Jay (Adrian Zmed), decide to throw him an epic bachelor party. The bride's wealthy, conservative parents are unhappy with her decision, and her father enlists the help of Debbie's ex-boyfriend Cole Whittier (Robert Prescott) to sabotage her relationship with Rick and win her back. While Debbie worries and goes off to a bridal shower thrown by her friends, Rick heads to the bachelor party, which takes place in a lavish, spacious hotel suite, and promises to remain faithful. Both parties start off on the wrong foot because of Cole's meddling. As the bachelor party starts to heat up, Debbie and the girls decide to get even with Rick and his friends by having a party of their own. Both parties eventually collide, leading to Debbie accusing Rick of infidelity. The bachelor party becomes a wild, drunken orgy and the hotel room is trashed, which infuriates the hotel's frustrated manager (Kenneth Kimmins). Adding to the confusion is Rick's friend Brad, who has become despondent over the breakup of his marriage and botches several suicide attempts. When Brad tries to slit his wrists with an electric razor, Rick says, \\"Well.....at least your wrists will be smooth and kissable.\\" Rick convinces Debbie of his love and faithfulness just as the party is raided by the police. In the ensuing melee, Rick and Debbie become separated and Cole kidnaps Debbie, so Rick and his friends chase after them. The chase culminates in a showdown between Rick and Cole in a 36-screen movie theater, with a fist fight taking place in synchronization with a similar fight being shown in a 3D film projected behind them; the audience believes that the real fight is an extraordinary 3D effect. Rick wins the fight and is reunited with Debbie. After the wedding, Rick and Debbie are driven to the airport for their honeymoon in Rick's school bus, which is driven by a laughing Brad.

Several members of the film's cast and crew were at that party when the idea began to take shape. The film was made in the wake of the success of Police Academy.

While some critics appreciated the humor, others found it to be vulgar and gratuitous. Film critics Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin both recommended the film, but had reservations about certain aspects, calling it \\"sophomoric\\" and \\"not a great film.\\" In a Los Angeles Times review, writer Kevin Thomas praised Hanks as a \\"likable, spontaneous zany\\" but felt that the film was 15 minutes too long: \\"That extra 15 minutes allows for just enough repetition (and just enough lingering over as much outrageous sexual connotation that an R rating permits) to let heavy-handed tastelessness creep in and dampen the fun.\\" Sequel Twenty-four years after Bachelor Party was released, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment produced a straight-to-DVD sequel (in name only) called Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation. TV show On October 21, 2014, it was reported that ABC would be developing a TV show inspired by the film.

It will be located on the former site of HMS Tamar on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. Tamar Station will be the eastern terminus of the Tung Chung Line and the western terminus of the Tseung Kwan O Line. It will also act as a transfer station between the two lines. The MTR plans to start construction of the station in 2021 and open it in 2026. Geographically, the Admiralty MTR station is located to the north, while the reclaimed Central and Wan Chai are to the south. The station would sit at the foot of the Central Government Complex, directly under Tamar Park. The Station will use the current footbridge which crosses Harcourt Road to connect Admiralty Station.  History  According to the original plan, the site of the station was to be the location of the new Central Government Complex. However, since the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, the Hong Kong government worried that should the government headquarters be built above the railway station, terrorists might use the station to commit an attack against the complex. Also, due to fluctuations in real estate, the Hong Kong government requested that the land be auctioned for commercial purposes. The development of the lot has been pending, which has had a direct impact on the construction project site and the North Island line. In 2006, the Hong Kong Government was set to implement the Tamar Development Project. The new Government Complex was inaugurated in 2011, but the timetable of the construction of the NIL station was still undecided. On 21 February 2013, the Highways Department published an improved version of the \\"Railway Development Strategy.\\" As part of the second phase of public consultation for the North Island Line, the department created two proposals: a \\"swap\\" scheme and an \\"interchange\\" scheme. In the former plan, the North Island Line would be split in two lines. The Tung Chung Line would extend east from Hong Kong Station to serve the new Tamar, Exhibition, and Causeway Bay North stations before using the current Island Line track from Fortress Hill to Chai Wan. Meanwhile, the Tseung Kwan O Line would extend west past North Point station to the Island Line's Tin Hau station before going along the current Island Line to the Kennedy Town station. In the latter, the Tung Chung Line would be extended one stop, from Hong Kong to Tamar, while the Tseung Kwan O Line would be extended three stops, from North Point to Causeway Bay North, Exhibition, and Tamar (with Tamar becoming an interchange station and terminal for the two lines). The Hong Kong government opted for the \\"interchange\\" scheme in 2014, which meant that the Tamar station would be a four-track, two-level station, as opposed to the two-track, one- level station proposed as part of the \\"swap\\" scheme.

Contradanza was brought to America and there took on folkloric forms that still exist in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Panama and Ecuador. In Cuba during the 19th century, it became an important genre, the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African rhythm pattern and the first Cuban dance to gain international popularity, the progenitor of danz√≥n, mambo and cha-cha-cha, with a characteristic \\"habanera rhythm\\" and sung lyrics. Outside Cuba, the Cuban contradanza became known as the habanera ‚Äì the dance of Havana ‚Äì and that name was adopted in Cuba itself subsequent to its international popularity in the later 19th century,Manuel, Peter (2009: 97).

The contradanza was popular in Spain and spread throughout Spanish America during the 18th century. According to musicologist Peter Manuel, it may be impossible to resolve the question of the contradanza's origin, as it has been pointed out by Cuban musicologist Natalio Gal√°n in humoristically labeling the genre as \\"anglofrancohispanoafrocubano\\" (English-French-Spanish-African-Cuban).Manuel, Peter: Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean.

In the book, he proposes a theory that signals the French contredance, supposedly introduced in Cuba by French immigrants fleeing the Haitian Revolution (1791‚Äì1803), as the prototype for the creation of the creolized Cuban Contradanza.Manuel, Peter: Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean. Temple University Press. Philadelphia, 2009, p. 52. However, according to other important Cuban musicologists, such as Zoila Lapique and Natalio Galan, it is quite likely that the Contradanza had been introduced to Havana directly from Spain, France or England several decades earlier.Manuel, Peter: Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean. Temple University Press. Philadelphia, 2009, p. 54. The earliest Cuban contradanza of which a record remains is \\"San Pascual Bail√≥n\\", which was written in 1803.Orovio 1981:118Manuel, Peter (2009: 67), Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. Certain characteristics would set the Cuban contradanza apart from the contredanse by the mid-19th century, notably the incorporation of the African cross-rhythm called the tresillo.Sublette, Ned 2004. Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo. Chicago. p134 The habanera is also slower and as a dance more graceful in style than the older contradanza but retains the binary form of classical dance, being composed in two parts of 8 to 16 bars each, though often with an introduction.Grenet, Emilio 1939. M√∫sica popular cubana. La Habana.Santos 1982 An early identifiable contradanza habanera, \\"La Pimienta\\", an anonymous song published in an 1836 collection, is the earliest known piece to use the characteristic habanera rhythm in the left hand of the piano.Roberts, John Storm (1979: 6). The Latin tinge: the impact of Latin American music on the United States. Oxford University Press. The contradanza, when played as dance music, was performed by an orquesta t√≠pica composed of two violins, two clarinets, a contrabass, a cornet, a trombone, an ophicleide, paila and a g√ºiro (Al√©n 1994:82). But the habanera was sung as well as danced. During the first half of the 19th century, the contradanza dominated the Cuban musical scene to such an extent that nearly all Cuban composers of the time, whether composing for the concert hall or the dance hall, tried their hands at the contradanza (Al√©n 1994:82). Among them Manuel Saumell (1817‚Äì1870) is the most noted (Carpentier 2001:185‚Äì193). The New Orleans born pianist/composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829‚Äì1869) wrote several pieces with the rhythm, gleaned in part from his travels through Cuba and the West Indies: \\"Danza\\" (1857), \\"La Gallina, Danse Cubaine\\" (1859), \\"Ojos Criollos\\" (1859) and \\"Souvenir de Porto Rico\\" (1857) among others. It is thought that the Cuban style was brought by sailors to Spain, where it became popular for a while before the turn of the twentieth century. The Basque composer Sebastian Yradier's \\"La Paloma\\" (\\"The Dove\\"), achieved great fame in Spain and America. The dance was adopted by all classes of society and had its moment in English and French salons. It was so well established as a Spanish dance that Jules Massenet included one in the ballet music to his opera Le Cid (1885). Maurice Ravel wrote a Vocalise-√âtude en forme de Habanera, and a habanera for Rapsodie espagnole (movement III, originally a piano piece written in 1895), Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' Havanaise for violin and orchestra is still played and recorded today, as is Emmanuel Chabrier's Habanera for orchestra (originally for piano). Bernard Herrmann's score for Vertigo (1958) makes prominent use of the rhythm as a clue to the film's mystery. In Andalusia (especially Cadiz), Valencia, Alicante, and Catalonia, the habanera is still popular. \\"La Paloma\\", \\"La bella Lola\\" or \\"El meu avi\\" (\\"My Grandfather\\") are well known.Berenguer Gonz√°lez, Ram√≥n T. \\"La Comisi√≥n de San Roque\\" Habanera Mp3¬∑ ISWC: T-042192386-5 2007 From Spain, the style arrived in the Philippines where it still exists as a minor art- form.Spanish Influence Dances. In the 20th century, the habanera gradually became a relic form in Cuba, especially after the success of the son. However, some of its compositions were transcribed and reappeared in other formats later on: Eduardo S√°nchez de Fuentes' T√∫ is still a much-loved composition.Carpentier, Alejo 2001 (1945). Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. The music and dance of the contradanza/danza are no longer popular in Cuba but are occasionally featured in the performances of folklore groups.

Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.  Danza, tango and later developments  The contradanza evolved into the clave (not to be confused with the key pattern of the same name), the criolla and the guajira. From the contradanza in came the (danza) habanera and the danz√≥n (Carpentier 2001:147). According to Argeliers L√©on (1974:8), the word danza was merely a contraction of contradanza and there are no substantial differences between the music of the contradanza and the danza. Both terms continued to denominate what was essentially the same thing throughout the 19th century. But although the contradanza and danza were musically identical, the dances were different. A danza entitled \\"El Sungambelo\\", dated 1813, has the same structure as the contradanza ‚Äì the four-section scheme is repeated twice, ABAB (Santos 1982) and the cinquillo rhythm can already be heard. Ignacio Cervantes The danza dominated Cuban music in the second half of the 19th century, though not as completely as the contradanza had in the first half. Two famous Cuban composers in particular, Ignacio Cervantes (1847‚Äì1905) and Ernesto Lecuona (1895‚Äì1963), used the danza as the basis of some of their most memorable compositions. In Cuba the danza was supplanted by the danz√≥n from the 1870s onwards, though the danza continued to be composed as dance music into the 1920s. By this time, the charanga had replaced the orquesta t√≠pica of the 19th century (Al√©n 1994:82 ‚Äì example: \\"Tutankamen\\" by Ricardo Rever√≥n). The danz√≥n has a different but related rhythm, the baqueteo, and the dance is quite different. The Argentine milonga and tango makes use of the habanera rhythm of a dotted quarter-note followed by three eighth-notes, with an accent on the first and third notes.\\"El Choclo\\" sheet music at TodoTango. To some extent the habanera rhythm is retained in early tangos, notably El Choclo and \\"La Morocha\\" (1904).La morocha sheet music at TodoTango. As the consistent rhythmic foundation of the bass line in Argentine tango the habanera lasted for a relatively short time until a variation, noted by Roberts, began to predominate.Baim, Jo 2007. Tango: creation of a cultural icon. Indiana University Press. .p124 In 1883 Ventura Lynch, a student of the dances and folklore of Buenos Aires, noted the milonga was \\"so universal in the environs of the city that it is an obligatory piece at all the lower-class dances (bailecitos de medio pelo), and ... has also been taken up by the organ- grinders, who have arranged it so as to sound like the habanera dance. It is danced in the low life clubs ...\\"Collier, Cooper, Azzi and Martin. 1995. Tango! The dance, the song, the story. Thames & Hudson, London. p45 () citing Ventura Lynch: La provinciade Buenos Aires hasta la definicion de la cuestion Capital de la Republica. p. 16. Ornamented and distributed throughout the texture, the contradanza remains an essential part of the tango's music.p2 Anibal Troilo's \\"La trampera\\" (Cheating Woman), recorded by him in 1962, uses the same habanera heard in Bizet's Carmen.\\"La trampera\\" sheet music at TodoTango. African-American music WC Handy (1873‚Äì1958) aged 19 African- American music began incorporating Cuban musical motifs in the 1800s. Musicians from Havana and New Orleans would take the twice-daily ferry between those cities to perform. Whether the rhythm and its variants were directly transplanted from Cuba or merely reinforced similar rhythmic tendencies already present in New Orleans is probably impossible to determine. The habanera rhythm is heard prominently in New Orleans second line music, and there are examples of similar rhythms in some African-American folk music such as the foot-stamping patterns in ring shout and in post-Civil War drum and fife music.Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 52). Africa and the Blues. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre \\"reached the U.S. 20 years before the first rag was published\\".Roberts, John Storm (1999: 12) Latin Jazz. New York: Schirmer Books. Scott Joplin (c. 1867‚Äì1917) For the more than quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent part of African-American popular music.Roberts, John Storm (1999: 16), Latin Jazz. New York: Schirmer Books. Early New Orleans jazz bands had habaneras in their repertoire and the tresillo/habanera figure was a rhythmic staple of jazz at the turn of the 20th century. A habanera was written and published in Butte, Montanta in 1908. The song was titled \\"Solita\\" and was written by Jack Hangauer.http://sandersmusic.com/bootnote.html?cut=4 Scott Joplin's \\"Solace\\" (1909) is considered a habanera (though it is labeled a \\"Mexican serenade\\"). \\"St. Louis Blues\\" (1914) by W. C. Handy has a habanera/tresillo bass line. Handy noted a reaction to the habanera rhythm included in Will H. Tyler's \\"Maori\\": \\"I observed that there was a sudden, proud and graceful reaction to the rhythm ... White dancers, as I had observed them, took the number in stride. I began to suspect that there was something Negroid in that beat.\\" After noting a similar reaction to the same rhythm in \\"La Paloma\\", Handy included this rhythm in his \\"St. Louis Blues\\", the instrumental copy of \\"Memphis Blues\\", the chorus of \\"Beale Street Blues\\", and other compositions.W. C. Handy, edited by Arna Bontemps, foreword by Abbe Niles, Father of the Blues: An Autobiography. New York: Macmillan Company (1941) pp. 99, 100. (No ISBN in this first printing.) Jelly Roll Morton (1890‚Äì1941) Jelly Roll Morton considered the tresillo/habanera (which he called the Spanish tinge) an essential ingredient of jazz.Roberts, John Storm 1979. The Latin tinge: the impact of Latin American music on the United States. Oxford. The rhythm can be heard in the left hand on songs such as \\"The Crave\\" (1910, recorded in 1938). Although the exact origins of jazz syncopation may never be known, there‚Äôs evidence that the habanera/tresillo was there at its conception. Buddy Bolden, the first known jazz musician, is credited with creating the big four, a habanera-based pattern. The big four (below) was the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march.Marsalis, Wynton (2000: DVD n.1). Jazz. PBS. As the example below shows, the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm.\\"Jazz and Math: Rhythmic Innovations\\", PBS.org.

The phrase is often used to express humorous criticism of middle-management, and specialty jargon, such as legalese, that non-specialists have difficulty in understanding. For example, \\"I don't understand all that legal mumbo jumbo in the fine print.\\" It may also refer to practices based on superstition, rituals intended to cause confusion, or languages that the speaker does not understand. __TOC__ Origins Mumbo Jumbo is an English word often cited by historians and etymologists as deriving from the Mandinka word \\"Maamajomboo\\", which refers to a masked male dancer who takes part in religious ceremonies. Mungo Park's travel journal Travels in the Interior of Africa (1795) describes 'Mumbo Jumbo' as a character, complete with \\"masquerade habit\\", whom Mandinka males would dress up as in order to resolve domestic disputes. In the 18th century mumbo jumbo referred to a West African god. According to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary: According to the 1803 Supplement to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Third Edition: Usage The phrase appears in Charles Dickens' Little Dorrit, originally published in serial form between 1855 and 1857. \\"He never dreamed of disputing their pretensions, but did homage to the miserable Mumbo jumbo they paraded.\\" It also appears in Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes published in 1873. 'A cracked edifice was a species of Mumbo Jumbo'. First published in 1899, The Story of Little Black Sambo has a titular protagonist whose parents are named \\"Black Mumbo\\" and \\"Black Jumbo\\". In 1972, Ishmael Reed wrote a postmodern novel titled Mumbo Jumbo which addresses a wide array of influences on African diaspora and culture including historical realities like the Scramble for Africa and the Atlantic slave trade as well as its invented influences like the \\"Jes Grew\\" virus. The novel includes an etymology taken from the first edition of the American Heritage Dictionary that derives the phrase Mumbo Jumbo from the Mandingo mƒÅ-mƒÅ-gyo-mb≈ç, meaning a \\"magician who makes the troubled spirits of ancestors go away.\\" While the novel quotes this dictionary entry and includes a lengthy bibliography, the work is largely fictional and regularly blurs the line between fact and fiction. The title can also be interpreted to refer to the notion that postmodern works like Mumbo Jumbo are often dismissed as nonsensical. The Story of an African Farm, an 1883 novel by Olive Schreiner, refers to half of a \\"Mumboo-jumbow idol [that] leaves us utterly in the dark as to what the rest was like.\\" Its reference symbolizes the confusion and lack of descriptiveness that came from such an idol. In his preface to Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, Jean-Paul Sartre uses the phrase when speaking of revolutionary violence being diverted into native African religion: \\"Mumbo-Jumbo and all the idols of the tribe come down among them, rule over their violence and waste it in trances until it is exhausted\\". In Vachel Lindsay's atavistic, racist poem The Congo, Mumbo Jumbo is used as a metaphor for the pagan religion followed by the Africans he encounters. The phrase is \\"Mumbo Jumbo will hoodoo you\\". Compare the first appearance of \\"Mumbo-Jumbo\\" in Lindsay's poem, in context: :\\"Be careful what you do, : [...] : Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo, : And all of the other : Gods of the Congo, : Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, : Mumbo- Jumbo will hoo-doo you, : Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.\\"  https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1021/pg1021.txt In Stranger In A Strange Land by Robert Heinlein, the character Jubal speaks of Mumbo Jumbo as the \\"God of the Congo\\" towards the end of the novel in a discourse on the meaning of religions. In Roots by Alex Haley, the Mumbo Jumbo is also mentioned in the context of tribal men disciplining disobedient wives. In the 1928 novel The Twelve Chairs, when describing the limited vocabulary of one character, it is stated that \\"The lexicon of a Negro from the cannibalistic tribe Mumbo-Jumbo comprises three hundred words.\\" The channel of a Minecraft YouTuber with over 6 million subscribers is named Mumbo Jumbo.

It was the first of three ships of the United States Navy to hold the name Nashville. Nashville (PG-7) was laid down on 9 August 1894 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia; launched on 19 October 1895; sponsored by Miss Emma Thompson, and commissioned on 19 August 1897, Commander Washburn Maynard in command. Service history =Pre-commissioning = The contract to build Nashville was awarded on Jan. 22, 1894, the first Navy construction contract won by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. The ship's originally planned sponsor was Miss Maria Guild, daughter of Nashville, Tennessee Mayor George Blackmore Guild. While Mayor Guild's party was en route to the christening ceremony, word was received that William Guild, Mayor Guild's son, was accidentally shot and killed. The party turned back immediately. Miss Emma Thompson, also from Nashville, christened the ship, with Joseph E. Washington standing in for Mayor Guild. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Upon commissioning, Nashville joined the North Atlantic Fleet; and, as war with Spain became imminent after the sinking of the armored cruiser , she was ordered to the Caribbean. She was credited with firing the first shot of the war when, upon sighting of the Buena Ventura, she fired a blank shot across the Spanish merchantman's bow. She captured four Spanish vessels from 22 April-26 July 1898, and assisted in cutting the undersea telegraph cable just off the shore of Cienfuegos, where many of her sailors and Marines were honored with Medals of Honor. Nashville remained on duty off Cuba until the war's end. =Pre-World War I= The gunboat departed the Caribbean for duty in the Philippines on 14 October 1899, arriving at Manila on 31 December via the Suez Canal. Nashville provided gunfire support for American troops in campaigns against Filipino insurgents until June 1900. When the Boxer Rebellion erupted in China, Nashville departed Cavite on 8 June for China with a Marine Detachment embarked. She arrived at Taku on 18 June, disembarked the Marines assigned to the International Relief Expedition, and remained until the allied forces lifted the siege of Peking. After patrol duty off China, Nashville arrived at Cavite on 3 February 1901, where she based until July. Transferred to the Mediterranean, the gunboat arrived at Genoa, Italy on 22 September. After a year's patrol duty, Nashville left Gibraltar on 1 November 1902, arriving at Boston, Massachusetts on 16 January 1903. On the Caribbean Station from 26 May 1903‚Äì4 March 1904, the Nashville was instrumental in preventing Colombian troops in Colon using the Panama railway thereby ensuring the success of the revolutionary junta in Panama and securing a treaty with the United States in building the Panama Canal. She returned to Boston on 18 June and decommissioned on 30 June. Recommissioned on 8 August 1905 at Boston Navy Yard, Nashville sailed on 8 September for Santo Domingo, operating off Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo until 26 June 1906, when she returned to Boston to decommission on 23 July. After three years in reserve, Nashville was assigned to the Illinois Naval Militia on 29 April 1909. From May 1909 ‚Äì July 1911, she trained militiamen on the Great Lakes, homeported at Chicago. USS Nashville caused an incident in 1909 when she was sent to the Great Lakes through the Canadian canal system unarmed. She was then later armed, along with four other ships, in contravention of the Rush‚ÄìBagot Treaty of 1817. After extensive overhaul and sea trials, she departed Boston on 7 January 1912, arriving Santo Domingo on 31 January to begin five years of patrol operations in the West Indies and off Central America, protecting United States interests. The ship participated in the United States occupation of Veracruz, proclaimed in April 1914 by United States President Woodrow Wilson, against the Mexican government of Victoriano Huerta. After a short period of reduced commission status from 10 May-8 July 1916 in New Orleans, the gunboat returned to Tampico, Mexico, where she remained until the U.S. entered World War I on 6 April 1917. =World War I= After temporary duty off Tampico, Nashville sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 2 August 1917, arriving Gibraltar on 18 August to patrol off the Moroccan coast. After serving as convoy escort off North Africa and in the western Mediterranean until 15 July 1918, Nashville departed Gibraltar, arriving on 1 August at Charleston, South Carolina. Lt. Forrest Sherman, future admiral and Chief of Naval Operations, served aboard at about this time. =Fate= Nashville decommissioned on 21 October 1918 at Charleston, South Carolina, and was sold on 20 October 1921 to J.

The western terminus is in Elgin, at the border with New York State south-west of Montreal (connecting with New York State Route 30 at the Trout River Border Crossing). Part of this highway is known as the Chemin du Roy, or King's Highway, which is one of the oldest highways in Canada. It passes through the Mont√©r√©gie, Lanaudi√®re, Mauricie, Capitale-Nationale and C√¥te-Nord regions of Quebec. In Montreal, Highway 138 runs via Sherbrooke Street, crosses the Pierre Le Gardeur Bridge to Charlemagne and remains a four-lane road until exiting Repentigny. This highway takes a more scenic route than the more direct Autoroute 40 between Montreal and Quebec City. It crosses the Saguenay River via a ferry which travels between Baie-Sainte-Catherine and Tadoussac. Until the mid-1990s, the highway's eastern terminus was Havre-Saint-Pierre, but in 1996 the extension to Natashquan was completed. A 40 km gravel section between Natashquan and Kegashka opened on September 26, 2013, with the inauguration of a bridge across the Natashquan River. A second segment of about 17 km extends from T√™te-√†-la-Baleine's airport, east through T√™te-√†-la-Baleine, to the ferry terminal southeast of T√™te-√†-la-Baleine. There is also a 10.7 km roadway, la route Mecatina, from Mutton Bay to a ferry terminal in La Tabati√®re and continuing beyond. A third segment of Route 138 extends from Old Fort to the Newfoundland and Labrador border (connecting with Newfoundland and Labrador Provincial Route 510), near Blanc-Sablon on the eastern end of the C√¥te- Nord.Trans-Labrador Hwy - Labrador 2003 - Page 5 A gap remains between Kegashka and Old Fort, through isolated communities accessible only by coastal ferry. On August 25, 2006, the Quebec government announced a 10-year project to connect the two segments by building 425 km of highway along the Lower North Shore. In 2011, the Quebec government announced an additional $122 million investment for the project over five years as part of the Plan Nord. However, by 2013 difficulties ensued between the Quebec Ministry of Transport and the Pakatan Corporation, who was previously responsible for managing the funding for this project, leading to the termination of agreement between the two.

Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif. from 1968 until 1986. He was involved in many research programs, including those with experimental wings, propulsion and digital computer flight control systems. Career Enevoldson attended several colleges. He received his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering and his M.S. degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Wyoming in 1963. He was a jet fighter pilot in the United States Air Force, and as an exchange officer with the Royal Air Force attended the Empire Test Pilot's School in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Following graduation, he served as a test pilot on the Hawker Hunter, English Electric Lightning, and Gloster Javelin British fighter aircraft from 1966 to 1967. Enevoldson had been awarded the USAF Distinguished Flying Cross in 1959 for his record flights in a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. In 1974 he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, for his contributions as NASA Project Pilot on the F-111 Supercritical Wing Program and on the F-15 Remotely Piloted Research Vehicle. In 1980 he was awarded second NASA Exceptional Service Medal for contributions as project pilot on F-14 stall and spin resistance tests. In 1986 he retired from NASA\\"NASA biography\\" NASA 7 May 2014. Accessed: 29 August 2014 and accepted a full-time position as the chief test pilot for the Grob EgrettGrob Egrett in Mindelheim, Germany in 1988. The Egrett was a high altitude reconnaissance aircraft for the German Air Force. Enevoldson set the absolute altitude record for all turboprop aircraft in the prototype Egrett in 1988, as well as time-to-climb. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the requirement for the Egrett diminished, and the project was cancelled after 6 aircraft had been built. Subsequently, he was the test pilot for the Grob Strato 2C.Strato 2C This was an extremely advanced, all carbon, very high altitude, propeller driven aircraft, built to carry two pilots, two scientists, and 2,000 pounds of scientific instruments to an altitude of 80,000 feet for 8 hours, or to 60,000 feet for 60 hours. On its 29th and final flight, Enevoldson reached an altitude of over 60,700 feet, which exceeded the official altitude record for all propeller driven aircraft by over 5,000 feet. The project was cancelled by the German Aerospace Research Center, DLR due to the cost of proposed final modifications necessary to make the aircraft mission-ready. Among the NASA aircraft that he flew were the F-111, F-14, F-8 Digital Fly-By-Wire and Supercritical Wing, YF-12A, the oblique wing AD-1, Controlled Deep Stall Sailplane, sub-scale F-15 remotely piloted spin research vehicle and the X-24B lifting body.Sailplane to the Stratosphere Among the pressure suits in which he flew are the US MC-4, US A/P22S-6, US S-1000, US 1030/1034, UK pressure jerkin with Taylor helmet, the Russian KK0-15, the US copy of the UK pressure jerkin with P-mask. Enevoldson said that he had never intended to specialize in high altitude testing, but over a long career he has probably accumulated more diverse experience there than anyone. He has flown above 50,000 feet in 14 different types of jet aircraft, one turboprop (record altitude), one reciprocating engine (5000 feet above record altitude), one sailplane (record altitude), and one rocket aircraft (glide flights). He also held several time-to-climb records in the F104 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 25 km searchname Einar ‚Äî which have since been broken). He may also hold the record for longest time between record flights ‚Äî 48 years. Perlan Project While working in Germany with the DLR he developed the meteorological basis for the Perlan Project. The theory, briefly, posits that the coincidence of the stratospheric polar night jet and the polar jet stream, when occurring over a mountain barrier, creates the necessary conditions for the amplification of standing mountain waves through the tropopause, in accordance with the Eliassen-Palm theorem. Enevoldson initiated a search for funding for the project. When balloonist and adventurer Steve Fossett heard about it from his friend Barron Hilton, Fossett enthusiastically joined the project as its sponsor. Using NASA and USAF full pressure suits Fossett and Enevoldson set the world sailplane absolute altitude record of 50,724 feet (15,460 meters), flying from El Calafate in the south of Argentine Patagonia, above the Andes mountains in the wind field of the stratospheric polar night jet.

He spent seven years in India, accompanied by his nephew William, also an artist, and published several series of aquatints of the country. Early life Thomas Daniell was born in 1749 in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. His father was the landlord of the Swan Inn at Chertsey (where he was later succeeded by Thomas' elder brother William and his wife Sarah). Thomas began his career apprenticed to an heraldic painter and worked at Maxwell's the coach painter in Queen Street before attending the Royal Academy Schools. Although he exhibited 30 works ‚Äì mainly landscapes and floral pieces ‚Äì at the Academy between 1772 and 1784, Daniell found it difficult to establish himself as a landscape painter in Britain. Like many other Europeans at that time, Daniell was drawn to India by stories of the wealth and fame that awaited travellers to the newly accessible East, and in 1784 he obtained permission from the East India Company to travel to Calcutta to work as an engraver, accompanied by his nephew, William Daniell, as his assistant. India Thomas Daniell - Tiger Hunting in the East Indies Thomas Daniell - Indian Temple, Said to Be the Mosque of Abo-ul-Nabi, Muttra Thomas Daniell - Ruins of the Naurattan, Sasaram, Bihar Thomas and William Daniell sailed from Gravesend on 7 April 1785, arriving in Calcutta via Whampoa in China early in 1786. In July of that year, Daniell announced, in an advertisement in the Calcutta Chronicle, his intention to publish a set of views of the city. Executed in etching and aquatint and hand-coloured by local painters, the twelve plates were completed in late 1788. In November of that year Daniell wrote to Ozias Humphrey \\"I was obliged to stand Painter Engraver Copper-smith Printer and Printers Devil myself. It was a devilish undertaking but I was determined to see it through at all events.\\" On 3September 1788, the Daniells set out on a tour of north-west India leaving Calcutta by boat along the River Ganges, travelling as far as Srinagar (in the District of Garwhal, Uttrakhand), where they arrived in May 1789. Thomas and his nephew spent 1790 and 1791 in the town of Bhagalpur (now in the Indian state of Bihar) with the orientalist and amateur artist Samuel Davis, whom Thomas had first met during his apprenticeship in London. They made many stops on their return journey, not arriving back in Calcutta until February 1792. On 10March 1792 the Daniells left Calcutta once more, this time for Madras (now Chennai), reaching it on the 29th of the same month. They left Madras after only 11 days, having hired the services of a considerable retinue, including two palanquins and their bearers, taking a route which more or less followed that of the British army which had defeated Tipu Sultan the previous year. They were back in Madras in January 1793. A briefer third tour took them through western India. They left Madras in the middle of February 1793 and reached Bombay the following month. In May 1793 the Daniells left India and returned to England, reaching home in September 1794. Return to England On his return to England, Daniell set about publishing an extensive illustrated work under the general heading title of \\"Oriental Scenery\\". Six volumes, published between 1795 and 1808, were based on drawings made in India by the Daniells themselves; another consisted of plates of the caves at Ellora after drawings by James Wales.The Daniells had met Wales in Ellora in 1793 two years before his death There were 144 plates in total including a set published as Twenty- four landscapes, views in Hindoostan drawn and engraved by Thomas and William Daniell, with permission respectfully dedicated to the Rt.Hon. George O'Brien, Earl of Egremont, first published on 1January 1804. The Daniells also published Views in Egypt (1808‚Äì9) and Picturesque Voyage to India, by Way of China (1810). They etched all the plates themselves, almost all in aquatint. Daniell continued to exhibit Eastern subjects until 1828. He also contributed drawings to Rees's Cyclop√¶dia, but these have not been identified. He contributed to some landscaping projects, designing an Indian temple for Sir John Osborne at Melchet Court, and various garden buildings for Sir Charles Cockerell's Sezincote. His paintings of Sezincote are rare exceptions to the Indian subjects which comprise almost his complete output after his return to England He was elected a Royal Academician in 1790, and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts at around the same time. Daniell never married. He died at his home in Earls Terrace, Kensington, on 19March 1840, aged 91, having outlived both his nephews.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911  Gallery  File:Sambhal Jama Masjid wash drawing.jpg Sambhal Jama Masjid wash drawing by Thomas Daniell & William Daniell.

Vendel era sword from Valsg√§rde In Swedish prehistory, the Vendel Period (550‚Äì790) comes between the Migration Period and the Viking Age. The migrations and upheaval in Central Europe had lessened somewhat, and two power regions had appeared in Europe: the Merovingian kingdom and the Slavic princedoms in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. A third power, the Catholic Church, had begun to expand its influence. In Scandinavia, the Germanic clan society was still very much alive. In Uppland, in what today is the east-central part of Sweden, Old Uppsala was probably the centre of religious and political life. It had both a well-known sacred grove and great Royal Mounds. There were lively contacts with Central Europe, and the Scandinavians continued to export iron, fur, and slaves; in return they acquired art and innovations, such as the stirrup. Finds from well-preserved boat inhumation graves at Vendel and Valsg√§rde show that Uppland was an important and powerful area consistent with the account of the Norse sagas of a Swedish kingdom. Some of the riches were probably acquired through the control of mining districts and the production of iron. The rulers had troops of mounted elite warriors with costly armour. Graves of mounted warriors have been found with stirrups and saddle ornaments of birds of prey in gilded bronze with encrusted garnets. These mounted elite warriors are mentioned in the work of the 6th century Goth scholar Jordanes, who wrote that the Swedes had the best horses beside the Thuringians. They also echo much later in the sagas, where king Adils is always described as fighting on horseback (both against √Åli and Hr√≥lf Kraki). Snorri Sturluson wrote that Adils had the best horses of his days. Swedish expeditions began to explore the waterways of what was to become Russia, Ukraine, Belarus at this time. Games were popular, as is shown in finds of tafl games, including pawns and dice. See alsoBattle on the Ice of Lake V√§nern *Ship burial *Stone ship  References Jesch, Judith (ed.) (2012).

It hosts multiple annual conventions and has often been used as a filming location in TV shows and movies (notably as a spaceport for Starship Troopers and used for the climactic fight scene in Rush Hour). History The convention center, designed by architect Charles Luckman, opened in 1971 and expanded in 1981, 1993 and 1997. It was originally built as a rectangular building, between Pico Boulevard and 11th Street (now Chick Hearn Ct.) on Figueroa Street. The northeast portion of the Center was demolished in 1997 to make way for the Staples Center. The Convention Center Annex of green glass and white steel frames, mainly on the south side of Pico, was designed by architect James Ingo Freed.Angels Walk LA - Figueroa, Self- guided Historic Trails, Angeles Walk LA, 2006 The area in front of the convention center is known as the Gilbert Lindsay Plaza, named for the late councilman who represented the Downtown area of Los Angeles for several years.

These groups take unwanted, abandoned, abused, or stray pets and attempt to find suitable homes for them. Many rescue groups are created by and run by volunteers, who take animals into their homes and care for them  including training, playing, handling medical issues, and solving behavior problems  until a suitable permanent home can be found. __TOC__ Rescue groups exist for most pet types (reptile rescue, rabbit rescue or bird rescue), but are most common for dogs and cats. For animals with many breeds, rescue groups may specialize in specific breeds or groups of breeds. For example, there might be local Labrador Retriever rescue groups, hunting dog rescue groups, large-dog rescue groups, as well as general dog rescue groups. Animal rescue organizations have also been created to rescue and rehabilitate wild animals, such as lions, tigers, and cheetahs; a job which is normally shared or backed by zoos and other conservation charities. These animals are normally released back into the wild where possible, otherwise they will remain in captivity and may be used in breeding for an endangered species. Widely recognized as an umbrella organization for animal rescue groups, Petfinder.org is an online, searchable database of more than 13,000 shelters and adoption agencies across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The American Kennel Club maintains a list of contacts, primarily within breed clubs, with information on breed rescue groups for purebred dogs in the United States. Animal shelters often work closely with rescue groups, because shelters that have difficulty placing otherwise healthy and pet-worthy animals would usually rather have the animal placed in a home than euthanized; while shelters might run out of room, rescue groups can often find volunteers with space in their homes for temporary placement. Some organizations (such as Old Dog Haven) work with older animals whose age would likely cause them to be euthanized in county pounds. Each year, approximately 3-4 million cats and dogs are euthanized in shelters due to overcrowding and a shortage of foster homes.Pets by the Numbers: U.S. Pet Ownership, Community Cat and Shelter Population Estimates Accessed 19 August 2017 In the United Kingdom, both shelter and rescue organisations are described using the blanket term rescue, whether they have their own premises, buy in accommodation from commercial kennels, or operate a network of foster homes, where volunteers keep the animals in their homes until adoption. Kennels that have a council contract to take in stray dogs are usually referred to as dog pounds. Some dog pounds also carry out rescue and rehoming work and are effectively rescue groups that operate a pound service. Some rescue groups work with pounds to move dogs to rescues. By law, a dog handed in as a stray to a UK pound must be held for seven days before it can be rehomed or euthanized. In the US, there are three classifications for pet rescue: * A municipal shelter is a facility that houses stray and abandoned animals, as well as animals that people can no longer care for, on behalf of local governments * A no-kill shelter is a usually private organization whose policies include the specification that no healthy, pet-worthy animal be euthanized * Not-for-profit rescue organizations typically operate through a network of volunteer foster homes. These rescue organizations are also committed to a no-kill policy. Many modern not-for- profit rescue organizations now not only focus on rehoming rescued animals, but rehabilitating and training them as well. Severely abused animals cannot move quickly from their previous environment into a new home. Specialized and trained rescue staff must identify signs of aggression and anxiety and work to remedy these behaviors. Like people, the recovery process is different for all animals. Some might recover immediately while others might always should signs of trauma. Rescue groups and shelters There are two major differences between shelters and rescue groups. Shelters are usually run and funded by local governments. Rescue groups are funded mainly by donations and most of the staff are volunteers. While some shelters place animals in foster homes, many are housed on-site in kennels. Some rescue groups have facilities and others do not. Foster homes are heavily utilized in either case. Within the dog rescue community, there are breed-specific and all-breed rescues. As its name implies, breed-specific rescues save purebred dogs of a certain breed, for example, Akitas, Boxers, Dalmatians, Labrador Retrievers, etc. Almost every breed is supported by a network of national and international rescue organizations with the goal to save abandoned dogs of this breed. All-breed rescues are not limited to purebred dogs. Instead they save dogs of any breed. Many work with specific shelters to support their efforts. Adopting through a rescue group Most rescue groups use similar adoption procedures, including completing an application, checking a veterinary reference, conducting an interview (can be in person or by phone) and a home visit. Rescue organizations are usually volunteer-run organizations and survive on donations and adoption fees. The adoption fees do not always cover the significant costs involved in rescue, which can include traveling to pick up an animal in need, providing veterinary care, vaccinations, food, spaying and neutering, training, and more. Most animals in the care of rescue groups live with foster home volunteers as members of the family until an appropriate adopter is found. There are a number of different techniques that can be used to make the transition from life at a rescue's foster home to an adoptive home easier on the animal. Generally, rescue groups provide adopters with basic information to aid in a successful transition. Often, adoption counsellors are involved in the process in order to ensure that the pet is being sent to a good, fitting home. Questionnaires for adoption vary between organizations, but are essentially used to ensure that the animal being adopted suits the lifestyle of the prospect owner and will have all of his or her needs fulfilled. The Canadian Federation of Humane Societies accounts for the largest amount of dog and cat shelters in Canada. With 172 shelters throughout the country, it is estimated that 103,000 cats and 46,000 dogs were taken in during 2013. Of these, 60% of cats and 49% of dogs were strays, 28% of cats and 34% of dogs were surrendered by their owners, 2% of cats and 3% of dogs were cases of abuse, and the rest were either transferred from neighbouring facilities or born in the shelters themselves. Of the thousands of animals in shelters in Canada in 2013, only 47% of dogs and 45% of cats were adopted. The remaining majority were left to be euthanized, sent back to their previous owners, or stayed in the shelters, possibly being transferred from one to another hoping for better outcomes. The rise of social media has since aided in adoption of pets, as shelters and rescue groups can now post pictures and biographies of the animals on their Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages. These outlets allow for people to, often without intention, find suitable pets in need of homes. Online interviews are now also possible, as well as international adoption through many organizations. Developments such as social media pages help shelters find appropriate adopters by venturing outside of their immediate surroundings and creating online networks, allowing more people to be exposed to the information and possibility of animal adoption. Dogs and cats of the Dominican Republic, for example, is an organization that creates profiles for stray animals in the Dominican Republic, and uses an almost entirely online platform to find homes for them, usually overseas, before sending them by plane, spayed and neutered, to be picked up by their new owner.  Wildlife rescue groups  Wildlife rescue groups, unlike many other animal rescue organizations, focus on the rehabilitation of sick, injured and orphaned wild animals. There are also groups which rescue animals from illegal breeders, roadside circuses, and many other abusive situations. They do not seek to find adoptive homes for the animals, but rather to reintroduce the animals to lifestyles that suit their needs and that allow them to live freely, sometimes even releasing them into the wild See also List of animal sanctuaries * List of animal welfare groups * Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals * Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals References Animal welfare organizations ","title":"Animal rescue group"},{"id":"1841649","text":"Lt.

For example, if M and N are two Riemannian manifolds with metrics g and h, respectively, when is there a diffeomorphism :\\\\phi:M\\\\rightarrow N such that :\\\\phi^*h=g? Although the answer to this particular question was known in dimension 2 to Gauss and in higher dimensions to Christoffel and perhaps Riemann as well, √âlie Cartan and his intellectual heirs developed a technique for answering similar questions for radically different geometric structures. (For example see the Cartan‚ÄìKarlhede algorithm.) Cartan successfully applied his equivalence method to many such structures, including projective structures, CR structures, and complex structures, as well as ostensibly non-geometrical structures such as the equivalence of Lagrangians and ordinary differential equations. (His techniques were later developed more fully by many others, such as D. C. Spencer and Shiing-Shen Chern.) The equivalence method is an essentially algorithmic procedure for determining when two geometric structures are identical. For Cartan, the primary geometrical information was expressed in a coframe or collection of coframes on a differentiable manifold. See method of moving frames.  Overview  Specifically, suppose that M and N are a pair of manifolds each carrying a G-structure for a structure group G. This amounts to giving a special class of coframes on M and N. Cartan's method addresses the question of whether there exists a local diffeomorphism œÜ:M->N under which the G-structure on N pulls back to the given G-structure on M. An equivalence problem has been \\"solved\\" if one can give a complete set of structural invariants for the G-structure: meaning that such a diffeomorphism exists if and only if all of the structural invariants agree in a suitably defined sense. Explicitly, local systems of one-forms Œ∏i and Œ≥i are given on M and N, respectively, which span the respective cotangent bundles (i.e., are coframes). The question is whether there is a local diffeomorphism œÜ:M->N such that the pullback of the coframe on N satisfies :\\\\phi^*\\\\gamma^i(y)=g^i_j(x)\\\\theta^j(x),\\\\ (g^i_j)\\\\in G (1) where the coefficient g is a function on M taking values in the Lie group G. For example, if M and N are Riemannian manifolds, then G=O(n) is the orthogonal group and Œ∏i and Œ≥i are orthonormal coframes of M and N respectively. The question of whether two Riemannian manifolds are isometric is then a question of whether there exists a diffeomorphism œÜ satisfying (1). The first step in the Cartan method is to express the pullback relation (1) in as invariant a way as possible through the use of a \\"prolongation\\". The most economical way to do this is to use a G-subbundle PM of the principal bundle of linear coframes LM, although this approach can lead to unnecessary complications when performing actual calculations. In particular, later on this article uses a different approach. But for the purposes of an overview, it is convenient to stick with the principal bundle viewpoint. The second step is to use the diffeomorphism invariance of the exterior derivative to try to isolate any other higher-order invariants of the G-structure. Basically one obtains a connection in the principal bundle PM, with some torsion. The components of the connection and of the torsion are regarded as invariants of the problem. The third step is that if the remaining torsion coefficients are not constant in the fibres of the principal bundle PM, it is often possible (although sometimes difficult), to normalize them by setting them equal to a convenient constant value and solving these normalization equations, thereby reducing the effective dimension of the Lie group G. If this occurs, one goes back to step one, now having a Lie group of one lower dimension to work with. = The fourth step = The main purpose of the first three steps was to reduce the structure group itself as much as possible. Suppose that the equivalence problem has been through the loop enough times that no further reduction is possible. At this point, there are various possible directions in which the equivalence method leads. For most equivalence problems, there are only four cases: complete reduction, involution, prolongation, and degeneracy. Complete reduction. Here the structure group has been reduced completely to the trivial group. The problem can now be handled by methods such as the Frobenius theorem. In other words, the algorithm has successfully terminated. On the other hand, it is possible that the torsion coefficients are constant on the fibres of PM. Equivalently, they no longer depend on the Lie group G because there is nothing left to normalize, although there may still be some torsion. The three remaining cases assume this. Involution. The equivalence problem is said to be involutive (or in involution) if it passes Cartan's test. This is essentially a rank condition on the connection obtained in the first three steps of the procedure. The Cartan test generalizes the Frobenius theorem on the solubility of first-order linear systems of partial differential equations. If the coframes on M and N (obtained by a thorough application of the first three steps of the algorithm) agree and satisfy the Cartan test, then the two G-structures are equivalent. (Actually, to the best of the author's knowledge, the coframes must be real analytic in order for this to hold, because the Cartan-K√§hler theorem requires analyticity.) Prolongation. This is the most intricate case. In fact there are two sub-cases. In the first sub-case, all of the torsion can be uniquely absorbed into the connection form. (Riemannian manifolds are an example, since the Levi-Civita connection absorbs all of the torsion). The connection coefficients and their invariant derivatives form a complete set of invariants of the structure, and the equivalence problem is solved. In the second subcase, however, it is either impossible to absorb all of the torsion, or there is some ambiguity (as is often the case in Gaussian elimination, for example). Here, just as in Gaussian elimination, there are additional parameters which appear in attempting to absorb the torsion. These parameters themselves turn out to be additional invariants of the problem, so the structure group G must be prolonged into a subgroup of a jet group. Once this is done, one obtains a new coframe on the prolonged space and has to return to the first step of the equivalence method. (See also prolongation of G-structures.) Degeneracy. Because of a non-uniformity of some rank condition, the equivalence method is unsuccessful in handling this particular equivalence problem. For example, consider the equivalence problem of mapping a manifold M with a single one- form Œ∏ to another manifold with a single one-form Œ≥ such that œÜ*Œ≥=Œ∏. The zeros of these one forms, as well as the rank of their exterior derivatives at each point need to be taken into account. The equivalence method can handle such problems if all of the ranks are uniform, but it is not always suitable if the rank changes. Of course, depending on the particular application, a great deal of information can still be obtained with the equivalence method.

Fran√ßois-Andr√© Vincent was a pupil of √âcole Royale des √âleves Prot√©g√©s. From 1771 to 1775 he studied at the French Academy in Rome. He travelled to Rome after winning the Prix de Rome with Germanicus Calms Sedition in his Camp in 1768, and was when he was installed at the Palais Mancini, where he painted numerous portraits, inspired by Jean-Honor√© Fragonard's style, who also was visiting Rome and Naples in the same time. In 1790, Vincent was appointed master of drawings to Louis XVI of France, and in 1792 he became a professor at the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris. In 1800, he married the painter Ad√©la√Øde Labille- Guiard who was well known for her mastery in portrait painting, a member of the Royal Academy and painter for the Royal Family. He was a leader of the neoclassical and historical movement in French art, along with his rival Jacques-Louis David, another pupil of Vien. He was influenced by the art of classical antiquity, by the masters of the Italian High Renaissance, especially Raphael. Fran√ßois-Andr√© Vincent was one of the principal innovators of the subjects and themes in French art of Neoclassical style and his works were of a high standard. He was one of the founder members of the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts ‚Äì part of the Institut de France and the successor to the Acad√©mie royale ‚Äì in 1795.

It describes the survival of individual prey animals that are different (through mutation) from their species in a way that makes it more likely for them to be ignored by their predators. It operates on polymorphic species, species which have different forms. In apostatic selection, the common forms of a species are preyed on more than the rarer forms, giving the rare forms a selective advantage in the population.Oxford University Press. (2013). Oxford Reference. Retrieved 21 November 2013, from Apostatic Selection: http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095419471 It has also been discussed that apostatic selection acts to stabilize prey polymorphisms. Apostatic selection was used in 1962 by Bryan Clarke in reference to predation on polymorphic grove snails and since then it has been used interchangeably with negative frequency-dependent selection.Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47‚Äì70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford. The behavioural basis of apostatic selection was initially ignored, but eventually established by A.B Bond Apostatic selection can also apply to the predator if the predator has various morphs. There are multiple concepts that are closely linked with apostatic selection. One is the idea of prey switching, which is another term used to look at a different aspect of the same phenomenon, as well as the concept of a search image. Search images are relevant to apostatic selection as it is how a predator is able to detect an organism as a possible prey. Apostatic selection is important in evolution because it can sustain a stable equilibrium of morph frequencies, and hence maintains large amounts of genetic diversity in natural populations.Allen, J.A. (1988) Frequency- dependent selection by predators. Philos. T. Roy. Soc. B 319, 485‚Äì503 It is important to note however, that a rare morph being present in a population does not always mean that apostatic selection will occur, and the rare morph could be targeted at a higher rate. From a predatory view, being able to select for rare morphs actually increases its own fitness Prey switching In prey switching, predators switch from primary prey to an alternative food source for various reasons.Suryan, R., Irons, D., & Benson, J. (2000). Prey Switching and Variable Foraging Strategies of Black-Legged Kittiwakes and the Effect on Reproductive Success. The Condor, 374‚Äì384. This is related to apostatic selection because when a rare morph is being selected for, it is going to increase in abundance in a specific population until it becomes recognized by a predator. Prey switching, therefore, seems to be a result of apostatic selection. Prey switching is related to prey preference as well as the abundance of the prey.  Effects on populations  It has also been determined that apostatic selection causes stabilization of prey polymorphisms, and this is caused by limitations of the predators behaviours. Since the common prey type is more abundant, they should be able to produce more offspring and grow exponentially, at a much faster rate then those with the rare morph since they are in much smaller numbers. However, due to the fact that the common morph is preyed upon more frequently, it diminish the exponential rate that they are expected to reproduce in, thus maintaining the population in stable amounts of common and rare morphs. Essentially, unless and environmental change or a species evolves it produces a stable equilibrium. Search image Blue tit searches for insect prey using a search image, leaving scarcer types of prey untouched. A search image is what an individual uses in order to detect their prey. For the predator to detect something as prey, it must fit their criteria. The rare morph of a species may not fit the search image, and thus not be seen as prey. This gives the rare morphs an advantage, as it takes time for the predator to learn a new search image. Search image shift require multiple encounters with the new form of prey, and since a rare morph is typically not encountered multiple times, especially in a row the prey gets left undetected. An example of this is how a Blue tit searches for insect prey using a search image, leaving scarcer types of prey untouched. Predatory birds such as insect-eating tits (Parus) sometimes look only for a single cryptic type of prey even though there are other equally palatable cryptic prey present at lower density.Dukas, Reuven, Kamil, Alan. (2000). Limited attention: the constraint underlying search image. Behavioral Ecology, 192‚Äì199. Luuk Tinbergen supposed that this was because the birds formed a search image, a typical image of a prey that a predator can remember and use to spot prey when that image is common.Tinbergen, L. (1960). The natural control of insects in pine woods. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds. Arch. Neerl. Zool. 13:265‚Äì343. Having a search image can be beneficial because it increases proficiency of a predator in finding a common morph type.Paulson, D. (2013). Predator Polymorphism and Apostatic Selection. Society for the Study of Evolution, 269‚Äì277. Hypothesis for polymorphism Apostatic selection serves as a hypothesis for polymorphism because the variation it causes in prey. It is an explanation for why external polymorphism exists and this theory has been tested many times. Apostatic selection has been referred to as \\"selection for variation in its own sake\\". Apostatic selection has been used as an explanation for many types of polymorphism, including diversity in tropical insects. Selection on different morphs in tropical insects is high because there is pressure for phenotypes to look as different as possible from all others because the insects that have the lowest density in a population are the ones that are preyed on the least.Rand, A. S. (1967). Predator‚Äìprey interactions and the evolution of aspect diversity. Atas do Simposio sobre a Biota Amaz6nica 5 (Zool.): 73‚Äì83.  Environmental Mechanisms  In order for apostatic selection to occur, and for the rare morph to have the advantage a variety of criteria needs to be met. First, there needs to be polymorphism present. In addition, the prey present can not be in equal proportions, since then there would not be a benefit to be able to detect either one. This is related to frequency dependent predation, where as the predator obtains the greatest advantage from having a search image for the most common type of prey. This causes the most common form of the prey is the most vulnerable. Changes in prey detection of predators occurs, but the speed in which it occurs and the flexibility a predators search image in dependent on the environment. If the frequency of the different prey types is continuously changes, the predator is not able to change their behavior at a rate in which will provide an advantage. In these situations, the predators who show a more flexible behaviour and have a more broad search image are able to survive. In relation to apostatic selection, large changes in prey frequencies decreases the magnitude of the advantage of the rare morph if their predators have a flexible search image. Also, the high changes in polymorphism frequencies can be an advantage to the prey with the rare morph. This is because the predators without the flexibility of their search image would have to have many encounters with the rare morph to change its search image. Predators need multiple consistent encounters with a prey in order to form its search image around it. Apostatic selection is also dependent on temporal variation. Since long periods of time are required for natural selection to act on predators, their degree of flexibility in their search image can not be changed over a short time frame. Therefore, quickly arising rare morphs favors apostatic selection since the predators are not able to change their behavior and search image in that time frame. This is yet another biological process that is a victim to evolutionary time delay. The predators are more quickly to adapt and decrease apostatic selection when a drastic and abrupt change to the prey frequencies occur. This does not change the flexibility of the predators, but elicits a very high speed in the change of the search image. Apostatic selection is most strong in environments in which the prey with the rare morphism match the background.  Behavioural Basis of Apostatic Selection  Most of the work done on the behavioural basis of apostatic selection was done by A.B Bond. It has been suggested that for frequency dependent predation, the amount of encounters with the prey aids to shape the predators prey detection. These ideas are based on the assumption that when the predator is learning foraging behaviour, they are going to obtain the common form more frequently. Since the predator is going to learn what is most frequently and commonly captured, the most common morph is what is identified as prey. This concludes that their foraging behaviour is shaped by this learned preference, thus causing apostatic selection and a fitness benefit to the rare morphs. From this, it was concluded that this search image formation and adaption is the mechanism that drives the most common prey type to be more easily distinguished from the environment, and thus be eaten more frequently. Experimental evidence Various types of experiments have been done to look into apostatic selection. Some involve artificial prey because it is a lot easier to control external variables in a simulated environment, though using wild specimens increases the studies external validity Often a computer screen simulation program is used on animals, often birds of prey, to detect for selection.Bond, A., & Kamil, A. (1998). Apostatic selection by blue jays produces balanced polymorphism in virtual prey. Nature, 594‚Äì596. Another type looks into how apostatic selection can focus on the predator as well as the prey because predator plumage polymorphism can be another example of how apostatic selection works in a population. They hypothesized that a mutant predator morph will become more abundant in a population due to apostatic selection because the prey will not be able to recognize it as often as the common predator morph.Fowlie, M., & Kruger, O. (2003). The Evolution of plumage polymorphism in birds of prey and owls: the apostatic selection hypothesis revisited. Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 577‚Äì583. Apostatic selection has been observed in both humans and animals, proving that it is not exclusive to lower level organisms, and the cognition it uses is applicable to all organisms in which can display learning. Though a lot of this work has been experimental and lab controlled, there are some examples of it happening with both wild specimens and in the natural habitat of the species. In hawks, almost all of their polymorphism is found on their ventral side it allows for less common coloration to be favored since it will be recognized least. Polymorphism is defined by foraging strategies, one of which is apostatic selection. Because of the different morphs and the varying selection on them, changes in prey detection maintain prey polymorphism due to apostatic selection. Apostatic selection can be reflected in Batesian mimicry. Aposematism and apostatic selection is used to explain defensive signaling like Batesian mimicry in certain species.Matthews, E. G. (1997). Signal-based frequency-dependent defense strategies and the evolution of mimicry. The American Naturalist, 213‚Äì222. A paper by Pfenning et al., 2006 looks into this concept. In allopatric situations, situations where separate species overlap geographically, mimic phenotypes have a really high fitness and are selected for when their model is present but when it is absent, they suffer intense predation. In this article it was suggested that this is caused by apostatic selection because strength of selection is higher on the mimics that are hidden by their original model.Pfenning, D., Harper, G., Brumo, A., Harcombe, W., & Pfenning, K. (2007). Population differences in predation on batesian mimics in allopatry with their model. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 505‚Äì511. In Batesian mimicry, if the mimic is less common than the model, then the rare mimic phenotype is favored because the predator has continued reinforcement that the prey is harmful or unpalatable. When the mimic becomes more common than the model, it switches and is preyed upon much more often. Therefore, the dishonest signals in prey can be selected for or against depending on predation pressure. An example in birds is observed within ground dwelling passerines, in which the wild birds were kept in their natural habitat but were presented with dimorphic prey (artificial). The two colors of prey were present in 9:1 ratios, and then the prey were switched so both colors were in the higher and lower ratio. In all four of the passerine species that were observed, the more common morph of the artificial prey were consumed more frequently. regardless of the color of it. This study also had a second component in which they allowed the birds to become familiar with one color of the prey, and then presented the dimorphic prey in equal amounts. In this case, the passerines consumed more of the prey that they were accustomed too. This is consistent with the idea that the search image influences apostatic selection, and the more familiar form is encountered more making it preferred. Apostatic selection has also been studied in cichlid fish, which presents a rare polymorphism, the gold ('Midas') colour morph. They discussed how apostatic selection a plausible mechanism for the maintenance of this Midas morph, and ruled out various other explanations for this morph. It was concluded that the rare morph is established by a difference in the predators detection probability of the Midas morph. One limitation of this study is that since the morphs in the wild are not able to be manipulated, no definite conclusions can be made, but the evidence predicts apostatic selection.

He founded the Cheney Lumber Company in 1936.https://www.worldforestry.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CHENEY- BEN-B..pdf He is credited with standardizing the size of wall studs at 8 feet long by 2 inches thick by 4 inches wide, commonly referred to as a 2-by-4. He is also known for his efforts in constructing Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, Washington, today home to the Tacoma Rainiers Minor League Baseball team. In the lumber industry, Cheney established mills in Tacoma and in Medford, Oregon. He also constructed mills in Greenville, Pondosa, and Arcata, California. Cheney came up with the idea of standardizing an 8-foot 2-by-4 around 1937 as a way to use timber that was wasted when railroad ties were cut out of large logs. By 1940, large railroad car loads of 2x4s were beginning to be shipped and used in construction.E-mail from Ken Ristine, Senior Program Officer, Ben B. Cheney Foundation As a sports enthusiast, Cheney sponsored sports teams in all the towns in which he was in business. He held an 11% stake in the San Francisco Giants. Cheney is most famous for helping build Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, personally contributing $100,000 to cover construction overruns of the stadium. A grinning, life-size bronze statue of Cheney, complete with scorecard and peanuts, occupies a front row seat in the grandstand of Cheney Stadium. In 1955, Cheney established the Cheney Foundation, a charity which encourages the growth and prosperity of communities where the Cheney Lumber Company was once active.

Ciardiello works primarily in pen and ink on water color paper and is best known for his work as a portrait artist, for clients such as American Express, Barnes & Noble.com, Capitol Records, The Folio Society, The New Yorker, The New York Times Book Review, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Rolling Stone, Smithsonian and Time. Early life and education Ciardiello was born in 1953 in Staten Island, New York. His grandparents were Italian immigrants who settled on the Island and his parents were born there as well. His father, Joseph A. Ciardiello was the youngest of four boys. He operated a dental practice in Staten Island., but also had a lifelong interest in drawing. Ciardiello attended a Catholic grammar school and was accepted into the High School of Art and Design. When Ciardiello was a senior in high school, he was setting his sights on becoming a cartoonist, until Murray Tinkelman came to the school as a guest lecturer. After hearing his lecture and looking at his drawings, Ciardiello decided that Tinkelman's approach as an illustrator offered more possibilities for him than cartooning. When he enrolled in the Parsons School of Design, it was as an illustration major. At Parsons he met his second important influence on his work, his figure drawing instructor, Jim Spanfeller through whom he learned a love of drawing in an expressive way. Other instructors at Parsons included Bernie D‚ÄôAndrea, Lorraine Fox and Maurice Sendak. Ciardiello would graduate from Parson in 1974 and receive his BFA in 1975. =Artistic influences= Apart from Tinkelman and Spanfeller, Ciardiello's early artistic influences came primarily from illustrators who were working at the time, such as Alan Cober and Leonard Baskin. Ciardiello also drew inspiration from the work of Egon Schiele, who was an early 20th century Austrian artist. Illustration career =Getting started= Ciardiello's work first appeared in print in 1974 during his senior year in college, in Crawdaddy Magazine, who's offices were a few blocks from Parsons and which Rolling Stone credited with being the first serious journal dedicated to rock and roll. Cited in The illustration was a black and white depiction of Lenny Bruce. Another early client who published Ciardiello was Penthouse Magazine. Scholastic Magazines was also an early client for the young artist. His first piece accepted into the Society of Illustrators Annual Exhibition was in 1975. =Professional life= In the late 1980s, Ciardiello began work on a series of black and white drawings of his favorite jazz musicians, such as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk and others. The drawings were compiled into a book, with poems by John Kruth, and art directed by Patrick Flynn. The book, titled Like Jazz was published in 1992. After the publication of Like Jazz, Ciardiello began illustrating for the Capitol Blues Collection for Capitol Records, which lead to 23 illustrated volumes, including the first in the series T-BONE WALKER The Complete Capitol / Black & White Recordings (1995) and the last in that series, CAPITOL BLUES #23: VARIOUS ARTISTS Chicago Blues Masters Volume Three (1997). In 1999, Ciardiello had a one-man exhibition of his works Portraits of Blues and Other Images at the Museum of American Illustration, which is housed by the Society of Illustrators, New York City. In 2016, Ciardiello won the Hamilton King Award, which is the highest award the Society of Illustrators can bestow to a member. The award was presented on behalf of Ciardiello's work illustrating the book On The Snap by Brian Case. In 2019, Fantagraphics published Ciardiello's A Fistful of Drawings, a collection produced over the previous five years inspired by Westerns. Working process When doing portraiture Ciardiello will gather as many photographs of his subject as possible. After this, he either draws sketches on tracing paper, which he places on a light box where the drawing is transferred to paper; alternately he will frequently go directly to a finished drawing in pen and ink, without preliminary sketches. Ciardiello primarily works with a Rapidograph pen, and occasionally a dip pen, on watercolor paper. Personal life Ciardiello lives in New Jersey with his wife artist Susan Blubaugh. He contributes original works for auction to support charities including the Drawing Dreams Foundation, The Printing Center of New Jersey and veterans charities. Ciardiello plays drums with the bands Kane Trio and The Half-Tones. The Half- Tones is an all-illustrator band consisting of Barry Blitt, Richard A.

It was founded by Mima Yoichizaemon Kagenobu at the end of the Sengoku period. The style specialises in iaijutsu but other arts, such as j≈çjutsu, naginatajutsu and kusarigamajutsu are practised as well.Antony Cundy: Classical Warrior Traditions of Japan, Part 6: The Suio Ryu of Iai Kenpo. Kendo World, Volume 2, Number 2, 2005 History Mima Yoichizaemon Kagenobu (1577‚Äì1665) was born in the Dewa Province to Mima Saig≈´, a priest at the J≈´nisha Gongen Shrine. In his youth he studied the Bokuden-ry≈´ of swordsmanship, as well as a style of j≈ç practiced by Shint≈ç mountain priests (Kong≈ç J≈ç j≈çh≈ç). When he was 18, he was beaten in a friendly duel by his father's friend, the samurai Sakurai Gor≈çemon Naomitsu, who had utilized iai-techniques of the Hayashizaki school, and afterwards began to study under him. After being given an overview of those techniques and vowing to create a style of his own, Yoichizaemon travelled throughout Japan, to test his skills against other martial artists. During this period he trained in the naginatajutsu of the Buddhist monks from Mount Hiei, techniques that were applied often by the monks during the Warring States period. Yoichizaemon was not content to develop only the physical side of his martial arts during this time. Instead, he continued training in ascetic practices, and meditated nightly, even going so far as to go on long retreats to secluded holy sites deep in the mountains. His perseverance in both his physical and spiritual training led to his eventual enlightenment. In the twentieth year of his exertions, he was struck with a vision of white gulls floating effortlessly and without conscious thought on water, and realised he could now use his sword in the same effortless manner. Based on his vision Yoichizaemon created the traditions 64 core techniques and named the style that arose from his revelation the \\"Sui≈ç-ry≈´\\", or Water-Gull style of swordsmanship. The spiritual, philosophical aspects of the tradition permeate the Sui≈ç-ry≈´'s techniques, and the core waza, or techniques, are directly linked to Mima's teachings based on Ry≈çbu Shint≈ç, a system of interpreting Shint≈ç deities into Mikky≈ç Buddhism. Yoichizaemon continued training and travelling throughout his life, and at age 67 retired to pass the Sui≈ç-ry≈´ to his son, Mima Yohachir≈ç Kagenaga. To the core techniques established by the founder, Yohachir≈ç added the ten basic Goin and Goy≈ç forms, which serve to establish strong basic technique. The 9th s≈çke Fukuhara Shinzaemon Kagenori created Masaki-ry≈´ Fukuhara-ha Kusarigamajutsu, in part based on the Masaki-ry≈´ of Manrikigusari, which has been handed down ever since as a separate tradition to each headmaster of the Sui≈ç-ry≈´ Iai Kenp≈ç. The tradition of oral transmission of techniques continues to the present day, in the person of the 15th s≈çke of Sui≈ç-ry≈´ Iai Kenp≈ç, Katsuse Yoshimitsu Kagehiro (also iaid≈ç ky≈çshi 7. dan, kendo ky≈çshi 7. dan, j≈çd≈ç renshi 6. dan). The headquarters of the tradition, the Hekiunkan (\\"Hall of Blue Clouds\\"), is located at Shizuoka City, Shizuoka prefecture, Japan.Katsuse Yoshimitsu: Bu Creates the Man. 8th International Seminar of Budo Culture, 1996 Curriculum The Sui≈ç-ry≈´ is a comprehensive martial tradition with a focus on iai-techniques. Among the forms practiced are the following sets: *Goy≈ç - Basic offensive techniques from seiza (5 kata) *Goin - Basic defensive techniques from seiza (5 kata) *Tachi-iai - Standing forms (9 kata) *Kuy≈ç - Advanced forms from seiza (9 kata) *Kumi-iai - Paired standing techniques (9 kata) *Several sets of kage-waza, \\"shadow techniques\\", that offer counters and answers to the variables in the Kuyo, Tachi-iai and Kumi-iai kata-sets (27 kata total) *Yami - a set of both offensive and defensive techniques intended to be of use when the practitioner finds themselves in complete darkness Most of the solo kata can be, and are, also practiced with a partner, often with the aid of another kata, i.e. by pairing an offensive kata with one that offers a suitable defensive response. In addition, there are also a large number of forms for other weapons. *J≈çh≈ç - Techniques for the staff (both j≈ç against sword, j≈ç against j≈ç) and short staff *Kogusoku - Semi-armored, armed grappling techniques *Naginatajutsu - Techniques for the glaive, both naginata against sword and naginata against naginata. In addition there is also a set of solo kata against cavalry *Kenp≈ç - Battlefield sword against sword forms, also forms for a short sword *Wakizashi - Techniques for the companion sword *Kusarigamajutsu - Techniques for the sickle and chain, both against a long sword and two swords (This is actually a separate tradition, Masaki-ry≈´ Fukuhara-ha Kusarigamajutsu) Succession The founder's son Yohachir≈ç succeeded his father to become the 2nd head of the tradition and the lineage has continued unbroken to the present day. Traditionally, the kage waza were shared only with the successor to the tradition, in a form of transmission called isshi s≈çden. However, now nearly all of the physical techniques of the tradition are taught openly. Even today though, one set of iai kata, which represent the very essence of the tradition's teachings, is set aside only for communication to the tradition's next s≈çke. The line of succession is as follows : #Mima Yoichizaemon Kagenobu, the founder #Mima Yohachir≈ç Kagenaga #Akiyama Sangor≈ç Kagemitsu #Nishino Shichizaemon Kageharu #Yoshino T≈çbei Kagetoshi #Yoshino T≈çzabur≈ç Ietaka #Yoshino T≈çgebei Sadamitsu #Yoshino Yaichir≈ç Sadatoshi #Fukuhara Shinzaemon Kagenori #Fukuhara Shingor≈ç Iesada #Fukuhara J≈´jir≈ç Sadayoshi #Fukuhara Shinbei Yoshisada #Mizuma Hanbei Kagetsugu #Katsuse Mitsuyasu Kagemasa #Katsuse Yoshimitsu Kagehiro, the current s≈çke Grades Instead of the modern ky≈´- and dan-grades, Sui≈ç-ry≈´, like most other kory≈´, uses a more traditional menj≈ç system of licenses. These licenses are, from lowest to highest, Shoden, Ch≈´den, Sh≈ç Mokuroku, Ch≈´ Mokuroku, Dai Mokuroku, Sh≈ç Menkyo, Menkyo Kaiden and Inka. The Inka license is given only to the successor to the tradition and is not accessible to others. These licenses act as recognition from the s≈çke that the practitioner has demonstrated a physical and mental progression in the tradition and later that they have his permission to transmit the teachings of the ryu. As is also common in classical schools, to properly learn its teachings the practitioner must formally join the school through an oath, keppan. In this oath the future member swears not teach or demonstrate Sui≈ç-ry≈´ without the permission of the s≈çke to preserve the school's integrity. In popular culture The writer of the popular manga series Kozure Ookami (Â≠êÈÄ£„ÇåÁãº) or Lone Wolf and Cub, Koike Kazuo utilized the name of the Suio ryu for the style of swordsmanship practiced by the protagonist of the series, Ogami Itt≈ç (Êãù ‰∏ÄÂàÄ), purely based on the romantic sound of the name. After learning of its actual existence he visited the headquarters of the tradition in Shizuoka, called the Hekiunkan, to pay his respects. Later, the fight choreographer of the second series of the TV show, featuring Yorozuya Kinnosuke, visited the Hekiunkan and impressed with the movements of the tradition spent some time learning the kata of the school. In the final series of this TV show actual kata from the tradition are performed and referenced in amongst the other more stylized movements.

It was founded on 12 April 1963 as a breakaway party from the Swaziland Progressive Party (SPP) led by Dr. J. J. Nquku. History  It was launched on 24 February 1963 founded by Dr. Ambrose Phesheya Zwane and Prince Dumisa. It had relations with Ghana as a Pan-Africanist Movement; it sent its members for political training to the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute. Golden Highlanders were sent by the British Army in the early sixties due to pressure of the party‚Äôs protest actions in demanding political reforms for an Independent state and class struggle for a minimum wage. The Congress of the party on the eve of the state election of 1967 saw a clash of interest within members to an extent that we lost a margin of them to other political parties and to the state. A breakaway party was formed in 1972 on the eve of state elections due to failure of the President accepting a woman candidate as the Deputy President in the party‚Äôs Congress. The party won three seats out of twenty-four in the State Elections and was the first opposition to a Parliament dominated by the Imbokodvo National Movement. Bhekindlela T. Ngwenya was deported by the ruling elite on suspicion that he was not a Swazi therefore could not be a parliamentarian. This was done in total disregard of the courts of the land which ruled in his favor. In 1973 the ruling party could not stand the NNLC as an opposition and therefore banned the party. The Leadership of the party was detained for sixty days without trial. Majority of our members that were able to escape the state forces and detention went to Tanzania, a Pan-Africanist State in which we had friendship with. After serving a long period in Tanzania the ruling class negotiated the return of the president, Dr. Ambrose Zwane. In 1997 the party reorganized itself though an Interim Committee led by Jimmy Hlophe. The party buried its President Dr. Ambrose Zwane on 28 March 1998 in an overwhelming public support in which King Mswati III was represented. At the end of November 1998 the party had its congress in which Mr. Obed Mfanyana Dlamini, a former Prime Minister won the Presidency. In the Elections of 1999 the party opposed the country‚Äôs electoral system and boycotted the elections. Some members registered and participated in the elections. These were taken to a disciplinary hearing of which they were expelled. However in 2003 the party did not have a positional resolution on the elections of which it opened opportunities for individuals in the party to participate in the elections. The party‚Äôs President participated in the elections and won as Member of Parliament under the Nhlambeni Inkhundla. It shall be noted that the NNLC has associated its membership with the Swaziland Democratic Alliance and the National Constitutional Assembly.

It was established in the 13th century and lasted until the 18th century. Several official flags of countries and towns of the territory of the old Crown of Aragon are based on this one Its name derives from the number of its members: one hundred (Catalan: cent). In 1249, James I created the fundamental structure of the municipal government of Barcelona: a board of advice of 4 members, helped by 8 counselors and an assembly of probi homines (leaders), all them members of the m√† major (Catalan for senior hand, or the upper class formed by wealthy merchants). After several modifications, by the year 1265, the municipal organization gained its more permanent structure: the municipal authority rested on 3 counselors elected by a Council of one hundred individuals. In year 1335, Peter III the Ceremonious permitted the Consell de Cent to use the royal insignia of the four (red) bars. The importance of the Consell de Cent in the history and the government of the Principality of Catalonia is supported by many examples. For instance, in year 1464 it proclaimed Peter V of Aragon (known as Peter the Constable of Portugal) as count of Barcelona. Another example is the rejection by the Consell de Cent of Martin the Humane's foundation on January 10, 1401 of the General Medical School in Barcelona with the same prerogatives as the University of Montpellier, because they felt this encroached on their municipal jurisdiction. This ultimately led to the creation of the University of Barcelona in 1450. In the last decades of the 17th century it was represented in the Confer√®ncia dels Tres Comuns (in Catalan: Conference of the Three Commons). The Consell de Cent was abolished by Philip V of Spain with the Decretos de Nueva Planta upon his occupation of Barcelona after the Siege of Barcelona in 1714. Since that moment, the new government of the city was controlled directly by the monarchy.

It is a pro-democracy socialist party. Formed in 1983 at the University of Swaziland, it is led by Mlungisi Makhanya. The Swazi government has been monitoring PUDEMO closely since it launched the Ulibambe Lingashoni (\\"Don't Let the Sun Set\\") campaign, which aims for a \\"total liberation\\" of Swaziland, and has recently cracked down heavily on even small manifestations of support for PUDEMO, such as the death in custody of PUDEMO member Sipho Jele, who was arrested for wearing a PUDEMO t-shirt in May 2010.  History  The People's United Democratic Movement was formed in 1983 at the University of Swaziland. Its 1985 manifesto stated that it was PUDEMO called for democratic reforms in 1988, 1990, and 1991. PUDEMO rejected King Mswati III's 1991 commission to review the tiNkhundla system, and the King's 1992 commission on electoral reform. King Mswati III responded by suspending the legislature, and began to rule by decree. The Swaziland Youth Congress claimed responsibility for a Feb. 6, 1995 fire in the House of Assembly. PUDEMO held a campaign of strikes and civil disobedience in 1996. In 2000, PUDEMO President Mario Masuku was arrested for \\"insulting the king, sedition and treason.\\" Pro-democracy protests took place in Swaziland in 2002, with \\"40% of Swaziland population believed to be on verge of starvation following poor harvests.\\" At the 2003 elections in Swaziland only non-partisans were elected. In March 2005, the Swaziland High Court ruled that \\"political parties can not exist.\\" In March 2006, PUDEMO members, including Bonginkosi Dlamini, the PUDEMO secretary-general, were charged with petrol bomb attacks. In April 2007, \\"Six PUDEMO members [were] charged with sedition following protests on the anniversary of King Sobhuza II's royal decree banning political parties.\\" In April 2008, PUDEMO's deputy President Gabriel Mkhumane was killed by criminals, according to the Swazi government. However, opposition supporters believe that he was assassinated by government operatives. The Umbane People's Liberation Army, described as \\"a secret militant group\\" linked to PUDEMO, claimed responsibility for a series of small bomb blasts in Swaziland in 2008. On 21 September 2008, Musa Dlamini and Jack Govender were killed while allegedly trying to bomb the Lozitha Bridge in an attempt to assassinate the King. Although PUDEMO had \\"called for a more militant approach to achieving democracy ... [it] denied any part in the bombing. However, at Musa Dlamini's funeral, PUDEMO President Mario Masuku was alleged to have verbally supported recent bombings of government institutions. Mario Masuku spent 340 days in prison before he was acquitted and discharged at the High Court on September 21, 2009. In May 2010, Sipho Jele, a PUDEMO member, was arrested for wearing a PUDEMO t-shirt, and later died in police custody. The Bhunya home of Alex LaNgwenya, a leader of PUDEMO's youth wing, the Swaziland Youth Congress (SWAYOCO), was destroyed in a bombing attack in 2010. \\"The Suppression of Terrorism Act of 2008 was enacted soon after the incident, and PUDEMO and SWAYOCO were banned as terrorist organizations.

Strychnos toxifera, the Strychnos species which is the principal source of 'Calabash Curare' and its main active constituent - the alkaloid toxiferine Curare (/k äÀàr…ëÀêri/ or /kj äÀàr…ëÀêri/; koo-rah-ree or kyoo-rah-ree) is a common name for various plant extract alkaloid arrow poisons originating from Indigenous peoples in Central and South America. Used as a paralyzing agent for hunting and for therapeutic purposes, Curare only becomes active by a direct wound contamination by a poison dart or arrow or via injection. These poisons function by competitively and reversibly inhibiting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a subtype of acetylcholine receptor found at the neuromuscular junction. This causes weakness of the skeletal muscles and, when administered in a sufficient dose, eventual death by asphyxiation due to paralysis of the diaphragm. Curare is prepared by boiling the bark of one of the dozens plant alkaloid sources, leaving a dark, heavy paste that can be applied to arrow or dart heads. Historically, curare has been used as an effective treatment for tetanus or strychnine poisoning and as a paralyzing agent for surgical procedures.  History  The word 'curare' is derived from wurari, from the Carib language of the Macusi of Guyana. It has its origins in the Carib phrase \\"mawa cure\\" meaning of the Mawa vine, scientifically known as Strychnos toxifera. Curare is also known among indigenous peoples as Ampi, Woorari, Woorara, Woorali, Wourali, Wouralia, Ourare, Ourari, Urare, Urari, and Uirary. = Classification = Initially, pharmacologist Rudolf Boehm's 1895 sought to classify the various alkaloid poisons based on the containers used for their preparation. During this investigation, he believed curare could be categorized into three main types as seen below . However useful it appeared, it became rapidly outmoded. Richard Gill, a plant collector, found that the indigenous peoples began to use a variety of containers for their curare preparations, henceforth invalidating Boehm's basis of classification. * Tube or bamboo curare: Mainly composed of the toxin D-tubocurarine, this poison is found packed into hollow bamboo tubes derived from Chondrodendron and other genera in the Menispermaceae. According to their LD50 values, tube curare is thought to be the most toxic. * Pot curare: Mainly composed of alkaloid components protocurarine (the active ingredient), protocurine (a weak toxicitiy), and protocuridine (non-toxic) from both Menispermaceae and Loganiaceae/Strychnaceae. This subtype is found originally packed in terra cotta pots. * calabash or gourd curare: Mainly composed of C toxiferine I, this poison is originally packed into hollow gourds from Loganiaceae/Strychnaceae alone. Manske also observed in his 1955 The Alkaloids: > The results of the early [pre-1900] work were very inaccurate because of the > complexity and variation of the composition of the mixtures of alkaloids > involved ... these were impure, non-crystalline alkaloids ... Almost all > curare preparations were and are complex mixtures, and many of the > physiological actions attributed to the early curarizing preparations were > undoubtedly due to impurities, particularly to other alkaloids present. The > curare preparations are now considered to be of two main types, those from > Chondrodendron or other members of the Menispermaceae family and those from > Strychnos, a genus of the Loganiaceae [ now Strychnaceae ] family. Some > preparations may contain alkaloids from both ... and the majority have other > secondary ingredients. = Hunting Uses = Curare was used as a paralyzing poison by many South American indigenous people. Since it was too expensive to be used in warfare, curare was mainly used during hunting. The prey was shot by arrows or blowgun darts dipped in curare, leading to asphyxiation owing to the inability of the victim's respiratory muscles to contract. In particular, the poison was used by the Island Caribs, indigenous people of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean, on the tips of their arrows. In addition, the Yagua people, indigenous to Colombia and northeastern Peru, commonly used these toxins in their blowpipes to target prey 30 to 40 paces in distance. Due to its popularity among the indigenous people as means of paralyzing prey, certain tribes would create monopolies from curare production. Thus, curare became a symbol of wealth among the indigenous populations. In 1596, Sir Walter Raleigh mentioned the arrow poison in his book Discovery of the Large, Rich, and Beautiful Empire of Guiana (which relates to his travels in Trinidad and Guayana), though the poison he described possibly was not curare. In 1780, Abbe Felix Fontana discovered that it acted on the voluntary muscles rather than the nerves and the heart. In 1832, Alexander von Humboldt gave the first western account of how the toxin was prepared from plants by Orinoco River natives.Curare darts and quiver from the Amazon rainforest.During 1811‚Äì1812, Sir Benjamin Collins Brody experimented with curare (woorara). He was the first to show that curare does not kill the animal and the recovery is complete if the animal's respiration is maintained artificially. In 1825, Charles Waterton described a classical experiment in which he kept a curarized female donkey alive by artificial respiration with a bellows through a tracheostomy. Waterton is also credited with bringing curare to Europe., reprinted in Robert Hermann Schomburgk, who was a trained botanist, identified the vine as one of the genus Strychnos and gave it the now accepted name Strychnos toxifera. = Medical Use = George Harley (1829‚Äì1896) showed in 1850 that curare (wourali) was effective for the treatment of tetanus and strychnine poisoning. In 1857, Claude Bernard (1813‚Äì1878) published the results of his experiments in which he demonstrated that the mechanism of action of curare was a result of interference in the conduction of nerve impulses from the motor nerve to the skeletal muscle, and that this interference occurred at the neuromuscular junction. From 1887, the Burroughs Wellcome catalogue listed under its 'Tabloids' brand name, tablets of curare at grain (price 8 shillings) for use in preparing a solution for hypodermic injection. In 1914, Henry Hallett Dale (1875‚Äì1968) described the physiological actions of acetylcholine. After 25 years, he showed that acetylcholine is responsible for neuromuscular transmission, which can be blocked by curare.19th century depiction of hunting with blowguns in the Amazon rainforest.The best known and historically most important (because of its medical applications) toxin is d-tubocurarine. It was isolated from the crude drug ‚Äì from a museum sample of curare ‚Äì in 1935 by Harold King of London, working in Sir Henry Dale's laboratory. King also established its chemical structure. Pascual Scannone, a Venezuelan anesthesiologist who trained and specialized in New York City, did extensive research on curare as a possible paralyzing agent for patients during surgical procedures. In 1942, he became the first person in all of Latin America to use curare during a medical procedure when he successfully performed a tracheal intubation in a patient to whom he administered curare for muscle paralysis at the El Algodonal Hospital in Caracas, Venezuela. After its introduction in 1942, curare/curare- derivatives became a widely used paralyzing agent during medical and surgical procedures. In medicine, curare has been superseded by a number of curare-like agents, such as pancuronium, which have a similar pharmacodynamic profile, but fewer side effects.  Chemical structure  The various components of curare are organic compounds classified as either isoquinoline or indole alkaloids. Tubocurarine is one of the major active components in the South American dart poison. As an alkaloid, tubocurarine is a naturally occurring compound that consists of nitrogenous bases, although the chemical structure of alkaloids is highly variable. Similar functional groups among the three compounds enables curare to bind to Acetylcholine receptors. Like most alkaloids, tubocurarine and C toxiferine consist of a cyclic system with a nitrogen atom in an amine group. On the other hand, while acetylcholine does not contain a cyclic system, it does contain an amine group. Because of this amine group, curare alkaloids can bind readily to the active site of receptors for acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction, blocking nerve impulses from being sent to the skeletal muscles, effectively paralyzing the muscles of the body.  Pharmacological properties  A neuromuscular junction. Curare blocks Ach receptors (bottom left). Curare is an example of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that blocks the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), one of the two types of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors, at the neuromuscular junction. The main toxin of curare, d-tubocurarine, occupies the same position on the receptor as ACh with an equal or greater affinity, and elicits no response, making it a competitive antagonist. The antidote for curare poisoning is an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor (anti-cholinesterase), such as physostigmine or neostigmine. By blocking ACh degradation, AChE inhibitors raise the amount of ACh in the neuromuscular junction; the accumulated ACh will then correct for the effect of the curare by activating the receptors not blocked by toxin at a higher rate. The time of onset varies from within one minute (for tubocurarine in intravenous administration, penetrating a larger vein), to between 15 and 25 minutes (for intramuscular administration, where the substance is applied in muscle tissue). It is harmless if taken orally because curare compounds are too large and highly charged to pass through the lining of the digestive tract to be absorbed into the blood. For this reason, people can safely eat curare-poisoned prey, and it has no effect on its flavor. = Anesthesia = Isolated attempts to use curare during anesthesia date back to 1912 by Arthur Lawen of Leipzig, but curare came to anesthesia via psychiatry (electroplexy). In 1939 Abram Elting Bennett used it to modify metrazol induced convulsive therapy. Muscle relaxants are used in modern anesthesia for many reasons, such as providing optimal operating conditions and facilitating intubation of the trachea. Before muscle relaxants, anesthesiologists needed to use larger doses of the anesthetic agent, such as ether, chloroform or cyclopropane to achieve these aims. Such deep anesthesia risked killing patients who were elderly or had heart conditions. The source of curare in the Amazon was first researched by Richard Evans Schultes in 1941. Since the 1930s, it was being used in hospitals as a muscle relaxant. He discovered that different types of curare called for as many as 15 ingredients, and in time helped to identify more than 70 species that produced the drug. In the 1940s, it was used on a few occasions during surgery as it was mistakenly thought to be an analgesic or anesthetic. The patients reported feeling the full intensity of the pain though they were not able to do anything about it since they were essentially paralyzed. On January 23, 1942, Harold Griffith and Enid Johnson gave a synthetic preparation of curare (Intercostrin/Intocostrin) to a patient undergoing an appendectomy (to supplement conventional anesthesia). Safer curare derivatives, such as rocuronium and pancuronium, have superseded d-tubocurarine for anesthesia during surgery. When used with halothane d-tubocurarine can cause a profound fall in blood pressure in some patients as both the drugs are ganglion blockers. However, it is safer to use d-tubocurarine with ether. In 1954, an article was published by Beecher and Todd suggesting that the use of muscle relaxants (drugs similar to curare) increased death due to anesthesia nearly sixfold., reprinted in This was refuted in 1956. Modern anesthetists have at their disposal a variety of muscle relaxants for use in anesthesia. The ability to produce muscle relaxation irrespective of sedation has permitted anesthetists to adjust the two effects independently and on the fly to ensure that their patients are safely unconscious and sufficiently relaxed to permit surgery. The use of neuromuscular blocking drugs carries with it the risk of anesthesia awareness.  Plant sources  There are dozens of plants from which isoquinoline and indole alkaloids with curarizing effects can be isolated, and which were utilized by indigenous tribes of Central and South America for the production of arrow poisons. Among them are: In family Menispermaceae: * Genus Chondrodendron notably C. tomentosum * Genus Curarea, species C. toxicofera and C. tecunarum * Genus Sciadotenia toxifera * Genus Telitoxicum * Genus Abuta * Genus Caryomene * Genus Anomospermum * Genus Orthomene * Genus Cissampelos, section L. (Cocculeae) of genus Other families: * several species of the genus Strychnos of family Loganiaceae including S. toxifera, S. guianensis, S. castelnaei, S. usambarensis * a plant in the subfamily Aroideae of family Araceae called taja * at least three members of the genus Artanthe of family Piperaceae * Paullinia cururu in the family Sapindaceae Some plants in the family Aristolochiaceae have also been reported as sources. Alkaloids with curare-like activity are present in plants of the fabaceous genus Erythrina.  Toxicity  The toxicity of curare alkaloids in humans has not been established. Administration must be parenterally, as gastro-intestinal absorption is ineffective. LD50 (mg/kg) human: 0.735 est. (form and method of administration not indicated) mouse: pot: 0.8‚Äì25; tubo: 5-10; calabash: 2‚Äì15.  Preparation  In 1807, Alexander von Humboldt provided the first eye-witness account of curare preparation. A mixture of young bark scrapings of the Strychnos plant, other cleaned plant parts, and occasionally snake venom is boiled in water for two days. This liquid is then strained and evaporated to create a dark, heavy, viscid paste that would be tested for its potency later. This curare paste was described to be very bitter in taste. In 1938, Richard Gill and his expedition collected samples of processed curare and described its method of traditional preparation; one of the plant species used at that time was Chondrodendron tomentosum. = Adjuvants = It is known that the final preparation is often more potent than the concentrated principal active ingredient. Various irritating herbs, stinging insects, poisonous worms, and various parts of amphibians and reptiles are added to the preparation. Some of these accelerate the onset of action or increase the toxicity; others prevent the wound from healing or blood from coagulating.  Diagnosis and management of curare poisoning  Curare poisoning can be indicated by typical signs of neuromuscular-blocking drugs such as paralysis including respiration but not directly affecting the heart. Curare poisoning can be managed by artificial respiration such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In a study of 29 army volunteers that were paralyzed with curare, artificial respiration managed to keep an oxygen saturation of always above 85%, a level at which there is no evidence of altered state of consciousness. Yet, curare poisoning mimics the total locked- in syndrome in that there is paralysis of every voluntarily controlled muscle in the body (including the eyes), making it practically impossible for the victim to confirm consciousness while paralyzed. Spontaneous breathing is resumed after the end of the duration of action of curare, which is generally between 30 minutesFor therapeutic dose of tubocurarine by shorter limit as given in: and 8 hours,For 20-fold paralytic dose of toxiferine (\\"calabash curare\\"), according to: depending on the variant of the toxin and dosage. Cardiac muscle is not directly affected by curare, but if more than four to six minutes has passed since respiratory cessation the cardiac muscle may stop functioning by oxygen-deprivation, making cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions necessary. = Chemical antidote = Since tubocurarine and the other components of curare bind reversibly to the ACh receptors, treatment for curare poisoning involves adding an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, which will stop the destruction of acetylcholine so that it can compete with curare. This can be done by administration of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, neostigmine, physostigmine, and edrophonium. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme used to break down the acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter left over in motor neuron synapses. The aforementioned inhibitors, termed \\"anticurare\\" drugs, reversibly bind to the enzyme's active site, prohibiting its ability to bind to its original target, ACh. By blocking ACh degradation, AChE inhibitors can effectively raise the amount of ACh present in the neuromuscular junction. The accumulated ACh will then correct for the effect of the curare by activating the receptors not blocked by toxin at a higher rate, restoring activity to the motor neurons and bodily movement.

Friesen was named the International Bluegrass Music Association's very first Bluegrass Broadcaster of the Year in 1990. He also produced the IBMA awards show from 1990 to 2000. The stations were purchased by Journal Broadcast Group in 1999. Prior to that they were owned by Great Empire Broadcasting (GEB), headquartered in Wichita. GEB was owned by Mike Oatman and Mike Lynch. (Lynch is also in the Country Music Disc Jockey's Hall of Fame in the Broadcasting Executives section.) At its peak, GEB was the largest chain of country music stations in the United States. Other country stations in the group were KVOO/1170 & KVOO-FM/98.5 in Tulsa, WOW/590 & WOW-FM/94.1 in Omaha, KTTS/1260 & KTTS-FM 94.7 in Springfield, MO. At one time they had also owned stations in Denver, Co.(KRBQ AM/FM) and Shreveport, La. (KWKH, home of the \\"Louisiana Hayride\\") All of the stations went by the \\"Radio Ranch\\" moniker and were full service country music stations. Local news, weather and traffic were emphasized. Lost pet reports were also aired on the stations. On July 30, 2014, it was announced that the E. W. Scripps Company would acquire Journal Communications in an all-stock transaction. The combined firm retained their broadcast properties and spun off their print assets as Journal Media Group. Ahead of the merger Journal was required by the FCC to divest KFTI-FM (92.3).

Middle Platonism absorbed many doctrines from the rival Peripatetic and Stoic schools. The pre-eminent philosopher in this period, Plutarch (c. 45‚Äì120), defended the freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul. He sought to show that God, in creating the world, had transformed matter, as the receptacle of evil, into the divine soul of the world, where it continued to operate as the source of all evil. God is a transcendent being, who operates through divine intermediaries, which are the gods and daemons of popular religion. Numenius of Apamea (c. 160) combined Platonism with Neopythagoreanism and other eastern philosophies, in a move which would prefigure the development of Neoplatonism. History Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 125‚Äì68 BC), was the pupil of Philo of Larissa, and the teacher of Cicero. Through his influence, Platonism made the transition from New Academy Scepticism to Eclecticism. Whereas Philo had still adhered to the doctrine that there is nothing absolutely certain, Antiochus returned to a pronounced dogmatism. Among other objections to Scepticism was the consideration that without firm convictions no rational content of life is possible. He pointed out that it is a contradiction to assert that nothing can be asserted or to prove that nothing can be proved; that we cannot speak of false ideas and at the same time deny the distinction between false and true. He expounded the Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic systems in such a way as to show that these three schools deviate from one another only in minor points. He himself was chiefly interested in ethics, in which he tried to find a middle way between Zeno, Aristotle, and Plato. For instance, he said that virtue suffices for happiness, but for the highest grade of happiness bodily and external goods are necessary as well. This eclectic tendency was favoured by the lack of dogmatic works by Plato. Middle Platonism was promoted by the necessity of considering the main theories of the post-Platonic schools of philosophy, such as the Aristotelian logic and the Stoic psychology and ethics (theory of goods and emotions). On the one hand the Middle Platonists were engaged like the later Peripatetics in scholarly activities such as the exposition of Plato's doctrines and the explanation of his dialogues; on the other hand they attempted to develop the Platonic theories systematically. In so far as it was subject in this to the influence of Neopythagoreanism, it was of considerable importance in preparing the way for Neoplatonism. The most important of the Middle Platonists was Plutarch (45‚Äì120), who also won fame as an historian. Although he was a Platonist, he was open to the influence of the Peripatetics, and even, in some details, to the Stoics, despite his polemics against their principles; he rejected absolutely only Epicureanism.Eduard Zeller, Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy, 13th Edition, page 307 In opposition to Stoic materialism and Epicurean \\"atheism,\\" he cherished a pure idea of God that was more in accordance with Plato. Nevertheless, he adopted a second principle in order to explain the constitution of the physical world. This principle he sought not in any indeterminate matter, but in the evil world-soul which had from the beginning been bound up with matter, but in the creation was filled with reason and arranged by it. Thus it was transformed into the divine soul of the world, but continued to operate as the source of all evil. He elevated God above the finite world, but he believed that God comes to our aid by direct revelations; this enabled Plutarch to justify popular belief in prophecy.Eduard Zeller, Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy, 13th Edition, page 308 The gods of popular religion are merely different names for one and the same divine Being and the powers that serve them. Daemons were for him agents of God's influence on the world. Plutarch defended freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul. Platonic- Peripatetic ethics were upheld by Plutarch against the opposing theories of the Stoics and Epicureans. Among later Middle Platonists there were Theon of Smyrna, who wrote a mathematical introduction to Plato, and Gaius (2nd century) who was a teacher of Platonist philosophy. His pupil, Albinus, wrote an account of his lectures, of which we possess the introduction. Around the same time, Alcinous wrote an extant treatise on Platonism, in which he postulated three principles: the first God, the ideas, which are regarded as thoughts of this \\"first God\\", and matter.Eduard Zeller, Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy, 13th Edition, page 309 Apuleius (c. 125), a popular writer, expounded an eclectic Platonism in his books On the God of Socrates and On Plato and his Doctrine which are written in Latin. Maximus of Tyre (c. 180), like Plutarch, endeavoured to bridge the gulf between a transcendent God and matter by the assumption of numerous daemons as intermediaries. Atticus (c. 175) opposed the eclecticism which had invaded the school and contested the theories of Aristotle as an aberration from Plato. He was an uncompromising supporter of Plato and regarded the theory of immortality as the basis of his whole system. Nevertheless, in this theology he approached more closely to the Stoic idea of immanence. Numenius of Apamea (c. 160) combined both Neopythagoreanism and Platonism. He exhibited a far- going syncretism. Like Plutarch he supposed that an evil soul was combined with matter. From this the mortal part of the human soul is derived, which he described as the second irrational soul. Because of its guilt the soul had to descend from its bodiless life into the body, and after its departure from the body, if it does not need to undergo further incarnation, it becomes indistinguishably united with God. A gift of God is the wisdom which is the highest good, and this gift is only granted to those who devote themselves to the ultimate good to the exclusion of all other thoughts.

James McMullan (born June 1934) is an illustrator and designer of theatrical posters. Born in Tsingtao, Republic of China (1912‚Äì49), where his grandparents had emigrated from Ireland as missionaries for the Anglican Church, he and his mother fled to Canada at the onset of World War II. In 1944, he enrolled at St. Paul's Boarding School in Darjeeling, India. After his father was killed in a plane crash, he joined his mother in Shanghai, and the two relocated to Vancouver Island, where he completed his high school education. McMullan's first theatrical posterWhen McMullan was 17, he and his mother emigrated to the United States, where he studied for a year at the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. He joined the United States Army and served at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where he drew diagrams of where to position propaganda loudspeakers on Sherman tanks. In 1955, McMullan moved to New York City to continue his art education at Pratt Institute. While studying there he supported himself by illustrating book jackets for authors such as Lawrence Durrell and Jorge Luis Borges. He also did magazine illustrations for Esquire and Sports Illustrated, among others. In 1969, McMullan joined the fledgling New York Magazine and helped develop its graphic personality. His most notable contribution to the publication was the artwork illustrating the story about a Brooklyn discotheque that served as the basis for Saturday Night Fever. McMullan's first theatrical poster was for the 1976 production of Comedians, produced by Alexander H. Cohen, who began to hire him on a regular basis. When Cohen's associate, Bernard Gersten, became Executive Producer of Lincoln Center Theater, he invited McMullan to join the organization. He eventually created more than forty posters for Lincoln Center productions, many of which are included in the 1998 book The Theater Posters of James McMullan.He has written a biography - Leaving China: An Artist Paints His World War II Childhood In 1981, McMullan published Revealing Illustrations, in which he candidly discusses his working method. He is the creator of the \\"High Focus\\" method of figure drawing, which he began teaching at the School of Visual Arts in 1987. He won a Drama Desk Special Award for his consistently inspired artwork for the theater in 1991. McMullan and his wife Kate McMullan have collaborated on more than a dozen picture books for children.

The dance company constructed around her, , was in residence at La Monnaie in Brussels from 1992 to 2007. Biography De Keersmaeker did not study dance until her last year of high school, instead studying music, specifically the flute. She studied from 1978 to 1980 at Mudra in Brussels, a school with links to La Monnaie and to Maurice B√©jart's Ballet of the 20th Century. She has said that the percussionist and her music teacher at MUDRA, , was a major influence on her. In 1981, she attended the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. While at the Tisch she presented her first production, Asch (1980), in Brussels. In 1982 upon her return from the U.S.A. she created , four movements to the music of Steve Reich. It was this production that brought her \\"a breakthrough on the international dance scene, performing, among other places, at the Avignon Festival\\".\\"The Dance of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker\\". Marianne van Kerkhoven. The Drama Review: TDR, Vol. 28, No. 3, Reconstruction. (Autumn 1984), pp. 98‚Äì104. The success of Fase contributed largely to the foundation of the Rosas in 1983. Rosas danst Rosas - Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's first choreography for the young company to new compositions of Thierry De Mey and Peter Vermeersch - brought Rosas the international breakthrough as a company. During the eighties, Rosas was supported by Kaaitheater of Brussels (director Hugo De Greef). Within the framework of Kaaitheater, her oeuvre took shape. Performances such as Elena's Aria (1984), Bart√≥k/Aantekeningen (1986), a staging of Heiner M√ºller's triptych Verkommenes Ufer/Medeamaterial Landschaft mit Argonauten (1987), Mikrokosmos-Monument Selbstportr√§t mit Reich und Riley (und Chopin ist auch dabei)/In zart fliessender Bewegung - Quatuor Nr.4, (1987), Ottone, Ottone (1988), Stella (1990) and Achterland (1990) were produced in collaboration with Kaaitheater. In 1992, La Monnaie's general director Bernard Foccroulle invited Rosas to become the resident company of Brussels' Royal Opera De Munt/La Monnaie. At the start of the residency, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker set herself three objectives: to intensify the relation between dance and music, to build a repertory, and to launch a dance school (after the disappearance of MUDRA from Brussels in 1988). That year, Rosas created ERTS and released Rosa - a film of a choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker to Bart√≥k music directed by Peter Greenaway. Later that year, Rosas created Mozart Concert Arias, un moto di gioia for the Avignon Festival. A production made in collaboration with the Orchestre des Champs Elys√©es, directed by Philippe Herreweghe. In 1993, Rosas created Toccata, to the music of J.S. Bach, for the Holland Festival. In May 1994, the KunstenFESTIVALdes Arts in Brussels premi√®red Kinok, produced in collaboration with Thierry De Mey and the Ictus Ensemble. At the end of 1994, this collaboration resulted in a new creation: Amor Constante m√°s all√° de la muerte. In November 1995, La Monnaie premi√®red Verkl√§rte Nacht, a choreography that was part of a production of Sch√∂nberg music Erwartung/Verkl√§rte Nacht. In 1995, Rosas and La Monnaie launched in Brussels a new international school for contemporary dance, the Performing Arts Research and Training Studios (PARTS), where sixty students coming from some 25 countries are trained, over a three-year period, by more than 50 teachers. In December 1996, Woud, three movements to the music of Berg, Sch√∂nberg & Wagner was premi√®red in Seville. At the beginning of 1997, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created, together with Steve Paxton and The Wooster Group, 3 solos for Vincent Dunoyer. In November 1997, Just Before, to a live performance by the Ictus Ensemble of music composed by Magnus Lindberg, John Cage, Iannis Xenakis, Steve Reich, Pierre Bartholom√©e and Thierry De Mey, was presented in La Monnaie. In February 1998, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker made her debut as an opera director at La Monnaie with Bart√≥k's Duke Bluebeard's Castle. In August 1998, the Impuls Festival in Vienna premi√®red Drumming, a production to Steve Reich's composition of the same name. In November Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created The Lisbon Piece, for the Portuguese Companhia Nacional de Bailado: her first experience as a guest choreographer. In March 1999, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created, together with Rosas dancer Cynthia Loemij and Jolente De Keersmaeker and Frank Vercruyssen from the theatre company STAN, Quartett; a dance-theatre performance based on the text by Heiner M√ºller. One month later, she choreographed and danced a duet with Elizabeth Corbett for the production with/for/by. In May 1999, Rosas premiered I said I, a collaboration with Jolente De Keersmaeker for the direction, with the Ictus Ensemble, Aka Moon and DJ Grazzhoppa for the music composition and execution. Jan Joris Lamers designed the set and lighting and Dries van Noten the costumes. For In Real Time in 2000, Rosas again collaborated with Stan, as well as with the jazz-ensemble Aka Moon for the composition and live interpretation of the music. In January 2001, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created Rain, another performance to a score by Steve Reich, his Music for 18 Musicians. 2002 saw the celebration of twenty years of Rosas and ten years of residence at La Monnaie, with the re-run of the text-pieces, the creation of (but if a look should) April me and Rain live, the two latter accompanied by Brussels contemporary music ensemble Ictus. A 336 pages book Rosas, if and only if wonder was published and a multimedia exhibition was organised in newly opened halls at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, and was attended by over 15,000 people. Once, a solo to the music of Joan Baez, concluded the celebration year's performances. 2003 showed yet a new evolution: whereas in the past her choreographies had been very precise and closely linked to the music, in Bitches Brew / Tacoma Narrows, De Keersmaeker for the first time allowed improvisation by her dancers during the performance. Over the past years, Rosas has also revived several earlier pieces: Rosas danst Rosas, ', Mikrokosmos, Achterland and others. Rosas' productions have been invited by theatres and festivals across five continents. In October 2011, De Keersmaeker publicly accused the R&B; singer Beyonc√© of plagiarising choreography from two Rosas pieces‚Äî\\"Rosas Danst Rosas\\" and \\"Achterland\\"‚Äîin the music video for the single Countdown. Awards Both the performances and the films of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker have been distinguished by various international awards. Rosas danst Rosas won the Bessie Award (1987), Mikrokosmos received a Japanese Dance Award for the best foreign production (1989), Stella got the London Dance and Performances Award (1989), Drumming was prized with the Golden Laurel Wreath for the best choreography in Sarajevo (October 1998). In 2011, she received the American Dance Festival Award for her career and at this occasion presented one of her seminal work Rosas danst Rosas (1983). The film Hoppla! was awarded a Sole d'Oro in Italy and the Grand Prix Vid√©o Danse in S√®te (1989). The film Rosa has been distinguished by a Dance Screen Award, got a Special Jury Commendation in the Black and White Short Film Competition at the Film Festival in Cork and was selected for the 49th Mostra Interazionale d'Arte Cinematografica in Venice (1992).

It is one of the few remaining inland, open-air salt- water swimming pools in the UK. Brief history The Lido was originally built in the 1930s and the building features an art-deco style interior. The pool itself was filled with diluted brine, pumped from brine streams beneath the town. The salt in the water was strong enough to keep the water in the pool aseptic, without the need for additional chemicals such as chlorine. When the lido opened, it was marketed as the 'seaside come to Droitwich Spa', and the pool was heated to exactly the same temperature as the Mediterranean Sea. During the Second World War, the lido was closed, and its offices used by the military. Resurrection The lido continued to be a popular tourist attraction. Even after its closure at the end of the 1990s, people still travelled for miles just to see the once-popular pool. In late 2004, Wychavon District Council voted against the re-opening of the lido, which sparked a local campaign group to form, with the sole aim of seeing the lido restored. Called \\"Save a Lido Today\\" (SALT), the group put pressure on the various councils and even went so far as to provide a business plan. In April 2005, the people of Droitwich Spa held a parish poll in which 98% of the people who voted were in favour of restoring the Lido. Following this, SALT continued to work with the District and Town councils to restore the Lido to a working condition. In the summer of 2007, the Lido reopened. One of the schools in Droitwich, Westacre Middle School, was the first to be able to go into the pool. Although the diving area has been filled-in to lower the water heating costs, the original 1930s fascia was left intact and the water still uses the salt that is the reason for the existence of Droitwich Spa itself.

It is administratively a subsidiary of the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes.  General information  The Institut d'√©tudes politiques of Grenoble was founded in 1948 on the model of Sciences Po Paris with the mission of providing France with public and private sector executives as well as specialists in the different fields of the social sciences. Its courses and degrees are modeled under the supervision of the National Foundation of Political Sciences. Since May 2012, Jean-Charles Froment has held the position of president (the former president was Olivier Ihl).  Admission  Alike other IEP (Institutes of Political Science) it differs from the bulk of French universities by its elitist nature - having a selective entrance exam, and the plural-disciplinary curriculum it provides its students with. This highly selective undergraduate entrance exam has a typical acceptance rate of no more than 12% (it was around 11% in 2011). Because of this Sciences Po Grenoble is considered to be a \\"grande √©cole\\". The entrance exam comprises two different tests: The first one is made up of an essay and two short questions on a book chosen by the IEP (In 2014 the book chosen was Maxim Leo's Red Love: The Story of an East German Family; The second test is an English level examination consisting of an essay and a written comprehension. Of the around 200 students admitted each year, half have just finished high school while the other half have spent a year preparing for the exam after their high school graduation. The IEP also has a special program for admitting underprivileged students and high level athletes which pass the entrance examination and an interview.  Curriculum  The plural-disciplinary curriculum the IEP provides has the objective of giving students a strong knowledge in the different fields of the social sciences and thus equip these students with a large cultural foundation enabling them to be more flexible in adapting themselves no matter the field they decide to work in. The first 3 years of the Sciences Po Program are the most diverse as courses in Political Science, Economics, Public Law, History, International Relations and Sociology are taught as well as a minimum of two foreign languages. In the second year of the 3 year undergraduate Program IEP students are sent abroad as exchange students and as they come back, specialize in one of the three sections the IEP proposes in the 3rd year of its curriculum. Following the 3rd year, students must choose and be accepted into the masters program they desire - which lasts two additional years. Although some students leave the IEP at the term of their 3rd year, new students are admitted from other universities at the masters level. The IEP has only 1200 students : 800 \\"diploma\\" students (following the main course in 5 years: the Diploma of the IEP), 250 postgraduate students and 150 foreign students. The means of the IEP are nonetheless sizeable. Both in terms of staff (170 teachers, 65 researchers) and resources (there are twice as many computers in the IEP as in the neighbouring Grenoble II University). While the IEP of Bordeaux is prominent for its training of high-ranking civil servants, and the IEP of Lille for its specialty in International Relations, the IEP of Grenoble is renowned for its different masters programs in political science, middle eastern studies and international relations. The IEP-Grenoble is home to the Centre d'Informatisation des Donn√©es Socio-Politiques (CIDSP), one of the most dynamic research centres in political science in France. Grenoble is also known for its studies in cultural policies, European policies, private and public management.  Faculty and career  Several of the IEP's teachers are well known in France and abroad. Jean-Louis Quermonne, now an honorary teacher, is one of the leading political scientists in France. Pierre Br√©chon, former director of the IEP and head of the CIDSP is a French specialist of quantitative studies. Many professors are non-academics who come with their professional from diverse professional backgrounds. This is especially the case for Masters level classes which are taught in coordination with other schools, among which the well established business school Grenoble √©cole de management or the Grenoble School of Journalism. Alumni from the IEP have various careers. The IEP has a broad curriculum which can lead to a diversity many professional paths. Grenoble alumni include politicians, lawyers, high- ranking civil servants, executives, entrepreneurs and even artists. A complete listing of the IEP's teachers is available on the Institute's website.  Miscellaneous  In 2012, the school administration banned all parties in the beginning the school year because of repeated hazing incidents that had occurred the preceding years (involving alcohol-induced comas and sexual assaults).http://www.ledauphine.com/isere-sud/2012/09/07/quand-les-week-ends Staff Francois Bafoil, political scientist * Olivier Bleys, novelist * Pr.

The Mekong giant catfish (Pangasianodon gigas; , , ; /tr…ôy riec/; ), is a large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. It is considered Critically Endangered due to accelerating habitat loss. Description Grey to white in colour and lacking stripes, the Mekong giant catfish is distinguished from other large catfish species in the river by the near-total lack of barbels and the absence of teeth. The Mekong giant catfish once held the Guinness World Records' position for the world's largest freshwater fish in 2005. Attaining an unconfirmed length of , the Mekong giant catfish grows extremely quickly, reaching a mass of in six years. It can reportedly weigh up to . The largest catch recorded in Thailand since record-keeping began in 1981 was a female measuring in length and weighing . This specimen, caught in 2005, is widely recognized as the largest freshwater fish ever caught (although the largest sturgeon species can far exceed this size, they are anadromous). Thai fisheries officials stripped the fish of its eggs as part of a breeding programme, intending then to release it, but the fish died in captivity and was sold as food to local villagers. Juvenile fish wear barbels that shrink as they age. Numbers of young fish are declining. Spawning fish in upper Cambodia are being over harvested. Larval fish are threatened by habitat fragmentation due to construction of dams which are becoming increasingly common. Distribution and habitat The Mekong giant catfish is a threatened species in the Mekong, and conservationists have focused on it as a flagship species to promote conservation on the river.MGCCG, 2005 Although research projects are currently ongoing, relatively little is known about this species. Historically, the fish's natural range reached from the lower Mekong in Vietnam (above the tidally influenced brackish water of the river's delta) all the way to the northern reaches of the river in the Yunnan Province of China, spanning almost the entire length of the river. Due to threats, this species no longer inhabits the majority of its original habitat. It is now believed to only exist in small, isolated populations in the middle Mekong region. Fish congregate during the beginning of the rainy season and migrate upstream to spawn. They live primarily in the main channel of the river, where the water depth is over , while researchers, fishermen and officials have found this species in the Tonle Sap River and Lake in Cambodia, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In the past, fishers have reported the fish in a number of the Mekong's tributaries. Today, however, essentially no sightings are reported outside of the main Mekong river channel and the Tonle Sap region. Understanding of the species‚Äô migration pattern is incomplete. The fish are thought to rear primarily in the Mekong and Cambodia's Tonle Sap lake and migrate hundreds of miles north to spawning grounds in Thailand. Spawning fish in the upper Cambodia are being over harvested. Fragmentation caused by infrastructure development of dams are becoming increasingly common posing threats to larval fish and reducing breeding abilities. Overfishing, damming, destruction of spawning, and breeding grounds and siltation have taken a toll on the species' habitat. Feeding As fry, this species feeds on zooplankton in the river and is known to be cannibalistic.(Pholprasith, 1983 as cited in Mattson et al. 2002) After approximately one year, the fish becomes herbivorous, feeding on filamentous algae, probably ingesting larvae and periphyton accidentally. The fish likely obtains its food from algae growing on submerged rocky surfaces, as it does not have any sort of dentition. The Mekong giant catfish are toothless herbivores who lives off of the plants and algae in the river. The fish have been studied (inside the stomach linings) to feed on zooplankton and phytoplankton. Conservation Endemic to the lower half of the Mekong River, this catfish is in danger of extinction due to overfishing, as well as the decrease in water quality due to development and upstream damming. A 2018 study suggests that the Mekong stocks could fall up to 40% as the result of dam projects. The current IUCN Red List for fishes classes the species as Critically Endangered; the number living in the wild is unknown, but catch data indicate the population has fallen by 80 percent in the last 14 years. It is also listed in Appendix I of CITES, banning international trade involving wild-caught specimens. In The Anthropologists' Cookbook (1977), Jessica Kuper noted the importance of the pa beuk to the Lao people and remarked, \\"In times gone by, this huge fish, which is found only in the Mekong, was fairly plentiful, but in the last few years, the number taken annually has dwindled to forty, thirty or twenty, and perhaps in 1976 even fewer. This is sad, as it is a noble fish and a mysterious one, revered by the Lao.\\" In 2000, fishers hauled out 11 giant catfish. In 2001 they caught seven. In 2002 they caught just five. Fishing for the Mekong giant catfish is illegal in the wild in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, but the bans appear to be ineffective and the fish continue to be caught in all three countries. However, in recognition of the threat to the species, nearly 60 Thai fishermen agreed to stop catching the endangered catfish in June 2006, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bhumibol Adulyadej's ascension to the throne of Thailand. Thailand is the only country to allow fishing for private stocks of Mekong giant catfish. This helps save the species, as lakes purchase the small fry from the government breeding programme, generating extra income that allows the breeding program to function. Fishing lakes, such as Bueng Samran (‡∏ö‡∏∂‡∏á‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ç) in Bangkok, have the species up to . The most common size landed is , although some companies specialise in landing the larger fish. The species needs to reach to breed, and it does not breed in lakes. The Thailand Fisheries Department has instituted a breeding programme to restock the Mekong River. From 2000 to 2003, about 10,000 captive-bred specimens were released by the Thai authorities. Specimens are released into reservoirs rather than the Mekong River itself. The Mekong giant catfish is described as a contemporary example of overharvest. Millions of tons of fish are harvested in Cambodia every year, with spawning fish being over-harvested. Fragmentation caused by dams increasingly poses threats to larval fish. Trends in water use, energy production, consumption and associated environmental degradation are projected to continue rising in southeast Asia. The Mekong giant catfish are highly migratory requiring large stretches of river for seasonal journeys and specific environmental conditions in their spawning and breeding areas. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) works in partnership with other organizations including the Mekong River Commission and the Asian Development Bank which aims to ensure that environmental and social impacts are considered in developments of hydropower infrastructures. It also implements projects dedicated to conservation, research, monitoring and raising awareness of the Mekong giant catfish. In culture and art In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. The species is represented as ancient art along the Mekong river.

Twigg won the first three editions of the Women's Challenge on the road. She trained at the University of Washington in Seattle beginning at the age of 14 and met personal coach Eddie Borysewicz three years later. Twigg was a three-time Olympian (1984, 1992, and 1996). However, her final Olympic appearance, in Atlanta in 1996, ended in controversy when she quit the team in a disagreement with the coach Chris Carmichael and the U.S. Cycling Federation. The federation had invested in the development of the so-called SuperBike. Twigg, after using the bike earlier in the Games, refused to ride it, citing poor individual fit and claiming that pressure from the staff on her to use the SuperBike and their refusal to grant accreditation to her personal coach, Eddie Borysewicz, left her defocused. Post-cycling life After retiring from competitive cycling, Twigg earned an associate degree in computer science and worked at various jobs in the information technology industry.

It is served by Seoul Subway Line 6 via Itaewon, Noksapyeong and Hanganjin stations. About 22,000 people reside in the district and it is a popular area for residents of Seoul, tourists, expats and U.S. military personnel. It is known as Seoul's International District and is the home of many foreigners in South Korea.  Etymology  The word Itaewon derived from the name of a government-run inn in the Chosun dynasty. Nowadays the area is known as Itaewon because of its abundant pear trees, the Chinese character meaning \\"pear.\\" According to ancient records, the area was also written using other hanja transcriptions, such as , and .  Local attractions  As Seoul's International District, Itaewon is known for serving cuisine that are not widely available in Korea, such as those from Britain, Germany, France, India, Italy, Southeast Asia, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Mexico, America, and Canada. Essentially, it is known as the \\"International District\\", or sometimes as \\"Western Town,\\" reminiscent of many Chinatowns in Western nations. Itaewon, along with neighborhoods and attractions like Hongdae, Insadong, and Seoul Tower, is one of the most popular places in Seoul for tourists. Major hotels such as the Grand Hyatt Seoul and local landmark Hamilton Hotel are here, as well as several smaller hotels and guesthouses. Dozens of shops are aimed at tourists, and offer Western or traditional Korean souvenirs. High-quality leather products, retail or custom made, and are sold at reasonable prices (though haggling is expected) as well. Itaewon was long known as a hub for high quality counterfeit goods, but those products have largely disappeared. Some authentic goods that are only produced in Korea for the international market, as well as some authentic imports are also available. Itaewon is known for its clothes makers who produce custom-made shirts and suits. Itaewon includes the area known as Homo Hill and is Seoul's Gay village. Despite the taboo nature of homosexuality in South Korea, people can express themselves openly within the neighborhood.

It is in the middle of Itaewon's elementary school district. There are many exotic restaurants alongside the street. FestivalGlobal village festival *Halloween festival Halloween festival in Itaewon Halloween festival In popular culture Korean singer-songwriter JYP (Park Jin-young) and Yoo Se-yoon's hip hop duo UV released the song \\"Itaewon Freedom\\" in April 2011. The title alludes to (and the lyrics celebrate) a common Korean perception of Itaewon's foreignness and open atmosphere, in contrast with conventional Korean culture, which is more conservative. The popularity of the song and its music video inspired a parody cover song and video from the girl group Crayon Pop in 2013. Both videos were partially filmed on location in Itaewon. The 2020 South Korean television series Itaewon Class is set in Itaewon. Revitalization Post 9/11 Itaewon is the commercial district closest to the Yongsan Garrison of the United States Forces Korea (USFK). In 2001, Itaewon was most known for the seedy bars and prostitution parlors that catered to the foreign soldiers and servicemen based in Yongsan. After 9/11, all military bases were put on lockdown with strict curfews imposed. As a result, many of the bars closed down. Coffee shops, trendy bars, and fusion and international fare restaurants opened in their places, turning Itaewon into a popular district for young, worldly Koreans and foreign residents. It now hosts an annual Itaewon Global Village Festival, cementing its reputation as an exotic, multi-cultural Gangnam.

Early life  The Sting, 1973Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Margaret Herrick Library catalog Richard Amsel Richard Amsel was born in Philadelphia. Shortly after graduating from Philadelphia College of Art, his proposed poster art for the Barbra Streisand musical Hello, Dolly! was selected by 20th Century Fox for the film‚Äôs campaign after a nationwide artists‚Äô talent search; the artist was 22 at the time.  Career  As Amsel came to the attention of New York's art enthusiasts, his illustrations caught the attention of Barry Manilow, \\"then a young singer/songwriter named who was working with Bette Midler, a newly emerging entertainer in cabaret clubs and piano bars. Manilow introduced the two, and it was quickly decided that Amsel should do the cover of her first Atlantic Records album.

In keeping with the magazine's stringent deadlines, Amsel's illustration was created in only two or three days.\\"Richard Amsel,\\" Rogallery. = TV Guide = Commissioned by TV Guide in 1972 to design a cover featuring the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, in conjunction with a telefilm about their love affair, Amsel then went on to 13-year association with the publication, during which time he produced more than 40 covers. Amsel's magazine work included portraits of: Ingrid Bergman, Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, Mary Tyler Moore, Elvis Presley, Nancy Reagan, Tom Selleck, Frank Sinatra, John Travolta, and Princess Grace, as well as of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, portraits which were created for the television debut of Gone with the Wind. He also created illustrations for the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, and of Richard Chamberlain for the miniseries Shogun.\\"Richard Amsel,\\" Rogallery. Among the most famous of Amsel's illustrations was his portrait of Lucille Ball, which was created for the magazine's July 6, 1974 issue in recognition of Ball's retirement from series television. \\"I did not want the portrait to be of Lucy Ricardo,\\" Amsel explained, \\"but I didn't want a modern- day Lucy Carter either. I wanted it to have the same timeless sense of glamour that Lucy herself has. She is, after all, a former Goldwyn Girl.

Raiders of the Lost Ark, Style A, 1981 = Later career = As film studios changed their marketing style in the 1980s, employing photographs in favor of illustrations, Amsel and other artists were frequently limited to creating work for science fiction, fantasy, and adventure films. In response, Amsel created the posters for Flash Gordon, The Dark Crystal, and Raiders of the Lost Ark which ultimately became his most famous work. Amsel completed two posters, one for Raiders' 1981 release and another, a year later, for its re- release. It has been reported that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg own the originals.\\"Richard Amsel,\\" Rogallery. Regarding commercial art, Amsel stated, \\"Commercial art can be and sometimes is art, but if someone hangs a poster, it is still a poster pretending to be something it's not. My work is basically for the printed page, and not for hanging in living rooms... If, however, I paint or draw something that takes people into the realm of fantasy, then I feel that I've accomplished something.\\" = Recognition = During his career, Amsel received multiple awards, including the New York and Los Angeles Society of Illustrators award, a Golden Key Award from The Hollywood Reporter, and a Grammy Award, as well as citations from the Philadelphia Art Director's Club. Amsel's covers were also shown at the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills, commemorating TV Guide's fortieth anniversary.\\"Richard Amsel,\\" Rogallery.

A feature film documentary about Amsel's life, titled \\"Amsel: Illustrator of the Lost Art,\\" was announced in January 2016. Filmmaker Adam McDaniel traveled extensively throughout the United States, conducting interviews with over 50 of Amsel's friends, colleagues, classmates, and art collectors, as well as new generations of artists whom Amsel inspired. The film is now in post production.  Death  His last film poster was for Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the third of George Miller's apocalyptic action movies with Mel Gibson. His final completed artwork was for an issue of TV Guide, featuring news anchors Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather. Amsel died less than three weeks later, succumbing to complications from AIDS on November 17, 1985. When he fell ill, he was to have done the poster for the Romancing the Stone sequel, The Jewel of the Nile.  AIDS Memorial Quilt  Panel in Richard Amsel's memory for The AIDS Memorial Quilt. Adam McDaniel created a panel in Amsel's memory for inclusion within The AIDS Memorial Quilt. It was unveiled for the first time on World AIDS Day, Dec. 1, 2018, next to The Wall Las Memorias AIDS Monument within Los Angeles' Lincoln Park. Later that month, it was also displayed at an Amsel tribute art show McDaniel curated at Warner Bros. Studios, in Burbank, California. On December 2, 2019, McDaniel handed the panel over to the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY. This coincided with World AIDS Day earlier that week (December 1st), and what would have been Amsel's 72nd birthday (December 4th).

The title, a British idiom one might find in housing advertisements, is short for \\"all modern conveniences\\" and is a pun on the band's association with the mod revival. The album reached No. 6 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was reissued in the US in 1979, with the song \\"The Butterfly Collector\\" replacing \\"Billy Hunt\\". Background and music Following the release of their second album, This Is the Modern World, the Jam undertook a 1978 tour of the US supporting American rock band Blue √ñyster Cult. The Jam were not well received on the tour and This Is the Modern World failed to reach the Billboard 200 chart. Under pressure from their record company, Polydor, to deliver a hit record, songwriter Paul Weller was suffering from writer's block when the band returned to the UK. Weller admitted to a lack of interest during the writing/recording process, and had to completely re-record a new set of songs for the album after producer Chris Parry rejected the first batch as being sub-standard. All Mod Cons was more commercially successful than This Is the Modern World. British Invasion pop influences run through the album, most obviously in the cover of The Kinks' \\"David Watts\\". The single \\"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\\", which Weller had originally discarded because he was unhappy with the song's arrangement, was rescued from the studio bin by producer Vic Coppersmith and became one of the band's most successful chart hits up to that point, peaking at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is a first-person narrative of a young man who walks into a tube station on the way home to his wife, and is beaten by far right thugs. The lyrics of the song \\"To Be Someone (Didn't We Have a Nice Time)\\" criticised fickle people who attach themselves to people who enjoy success and leave them once that is over. \\"Class issues were very important to me at that time ...\\" said Weller. \\"Woking has a bit of a stockbroker belt on its outskirts. So I had those images ‚Äì people catching the train to Waterloo to go to the city. 'Mr Clean' was my view of that.\\"The Guardian, 16 March 2009 All Mod Cons was reissued on CD in 2006, featuring a second disc of b-sides, outtakes and unreleased demos and a DVD containing a 40-minute documentary directed by Don Letts. Reception In his review for NME, Charles Shaar Murray said that the album was \\"not only several light years ahead of anything they've done before but also the album that's going to catapult the Jam right into the front rank of international rock and roll; one of the handful of truly essential rock albums of the last few years.\\" Dave Schulps of Trouser Press stated that \\"All Mod Cons firmly establishes Paul Weller (and the Jam) as a major talent (and band) for the '80s.\\" NME ranked All Mod Cons as the second best album of 1978 in its end of year review. In 2000, Q magazine placed All Mod Cons at number 50 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. The album is also listed as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2013, NME ranked it at number 219 in its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

They previously had a production team called The DFA, consisting of Goldsworthy and Murphy. History Visual projections over DFA logo at a 2014 anniversary party in Los Angeles James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy met while working in New York on the David Holmes album Let's Get Killed. After the recording was completed, Goldsworthy stayed in New York, and the two began to throw parties in the Lower East Side. They created the production duo, The DFA, but wished to grow The DFA into more than what it was. It was not until they met Jonathan Galkin, who subsequently quit his event-production job to work with James and Tim, that they turned DFA into a label. DFA Records began on a series of 12\\" single vinyl releases starting with The Rapture's \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" and The Juan Maclean's \\"By the Time I Get to Venus\\". \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" went on to sell 7500 copies. Many of the early releases of DFA's catalog were released in Europe through Trevor Jackson's Output Recordings. After completing production on The Rapture's debut full-length album Echoes, DFA began to shop around the album. Although The Rapture eventually signed to Universal Music Group, the DFA label secured a deal with EMI for distribution of its acts outside the United States, along with several distributors within the U.S. The label has grown steadily since, producing full-length albums for its ever-growing roster of artists, as well as releasing a selection of singles and compilations on their label. Notable releases include The Rapture's EP \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\", the twice-Grammy nominated debut of James Murphy's band LCD Soundsystem and its follow-ups Sound of Silver, This Is Happening and American Dream. DFA have also released a number of compilation albums featuring artists such as The Rapture, The Juan Maclean, Black Dice, Shit Robot, Delia Gonzalez & Gavin Russom, J.O.Y., Pixeltan, Black Leotard Front, Hot Chip, and LCD Soundsystem. As a production team, the DFA have produced and remixed artists including Radio 4, Le Tigre, N.E.R.D., Soulwax, Blues Explosion, Nine Inch Nails, Automato, Gorillaz, UNKLE, The Chemical Brothers and M.I.A.. The DFA remix of M.I.A.'s \\"Paper Planes\\" appeared on A. R. Rahman's Academy Award-winning Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack. They spent an afternoon writing a song with Britney Spears, and were also approached by Janet Jackson to collaborate. The production duo effectively came to an end when Tim Goldsworthy left New York and moved back to his native UK. The label is now primarily run by Jonathan Galkin and Kris Petersen. =Death From Abroad= In 2007 DFA Records started an imprint label titled Death From Abroad. This offshoot is used to release 12\\" singles by artists not based in North America, such as Mock & Toof and ALTZ. The imprint also released a CD compilation of tracks released on the Berlin based Supersoul Recordings. =Name dispute= The label's original name was Death From Above Records, dating from Murphy's nickname for the sound system he had helped build for Six Finger Satellite. This name was deemed inappropriate for a New York City-based label following the September 11, 2001 attacks and subsequently shortened to its abbreviation DFA. In 2004, DFA Records forced the Canadian duo Death From Above to change their name to Death from Above 1979. Murphy explained his side of the story in a 2005 interview with Pitchfork Media: > We knew about them for a long time, the name thing wasn't a big deal. It > wasn't until they signed to a major label, which wouldn't release the record > until we signed off on the name. That's how this all came about.... [Parent > company of Death From Above 1979's label, Vice] Atlantic's not gonna release > a record by a band with the same name as another entity in music.... We > spent a lot of money because we didn't just wanna be total fucking assholes > and just say no. We were trying to find a way for it to actually work.... I > was like, \\"What the hell's wrong with Death From Above 1979?\\" But the > copyright attorney was like, \\"No, that's not fine.\\" And I said, \\"If they > become a totally different name, and it delays their record, that's > something I'm not comfortable with.\\" So we just tried to make it work as > well as possible. The band would later go on to change their name to Death from Above in 2017 without any legal repercussions. =Dispute over finances= In 2013 Murphy filed a lawsuit against Goldsworthy, alleging he owed money and had been making unauthorised withdrawals from bank accounts and using the company credit card improperly. Sound and influence As well as Murphy's LCD Soundsystem the label is currently home to the likes of The Juan Maclean, Hot Chip (North America only), Shit Robot, Gavin Russom, Prinzhorn Dance School, Shocking Pinks, Holy Ghost!, Still Going, Syclops, Planningtorock and Yacht. They are also jointly releasing music with fellow New York City based label Rong Music, by artists such as Free Blood and Woolfy. The label has also reissued the first two albums by Athens, Georgia based new wave band Pylon, the first time they have been available on CD, as well as a retrospective collection of tracks by Peter Gordon and the Love of Life Orchestra. The influence of musicians and bands like Brian Eno, Talking Heads, Liquid Liquid, ESG, Blondie, Yazoo, New Order, as well as Chicago House, can be heard throughout the DFA catalog. Rather than retread, however, the DFA have taken the live dance music of the time and infused the techniques and themes with a modern aesthetic‚Äîalternately faster, heavier, dubbier, noisier, and generally more intense than their influences.

His academic work concentrated on modern Russian history since the Bolshevik Revolution and Russia's relationship with the United States. Cohen was a contributing editor to The Nation magazine, published and partially owned by his wife Katrina vanden Heuvel. Cohen was a founding director of the reestablished American Committee for East‚ÄìWest Accord which was revived in 2015. Early life and academic career Cohen was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and later grew up in Owensboro, Kentucky, the son of Ruth (Frand) and Marvin Cohen, who owned a jewelry store and a golf course in Hollywood, Florida. His grandfather emigrated to the United States from Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire). Cohen graduated from the Pine Crest School in Florida. He attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he earned a B.S. in economics and public policy in 1960 and an M.A. in government and Russian studies in 1962. While on an undergraduate study abroad program in England, he took a four-week trip to the Soviet Union, where he became interested in its history and politics. After completing his Ph.D. in government and Russian studies at Columbia University in 1968, he became a professor of politics at Princeton University later that year and remained on its faculty until 1998, when he became Professor of Politics, Emeritus. He then taught at New York University until his retirement in 2011, when he became Professor Emeritus of Russian and Slavic Studies. Writings and activities =Soviet and Yeltsin eras= In his first book, Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution, a biography of Nikolai Bukharin, a leading Bolshevik official and editor of Pravda, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Cohen argued that Communism in the Soviet Union could have easily taken a different direction, not leading to Joseph Stalin's dictatorship and purges. Cohen believed that it was completely possible for Bukharin to have succeeded Lenin and that the Soviet Union under Bukharin would have had greater openness, economic flexibility, and democracy. Richard Lowenthal in 1985, in a review of Cohen's Rethinking the Soviet Experience: Politics and History since 1917 found this view contentious. In his book War with Russia? (2019), Cohen relayed his suspicion that at \\"least one U.S.‚ÄìSoviet summit seems to have been sabotaged. The third Eisenhower‚ÄìKhrushchev meeting, scheduled for Paris in 1960, was aborted by the Soviets shooting down a US U-2 spy plane sent, some think, by 'deep state'. During the Cold War, Cohen was critical of both Western hawks and also the Soviet government, which banned him from visiting the country from 1982 to 1985. Cohen said in early 1985 said the reasons had not been revealed to him. Cohen gave his support to perestroika, the reforms initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev and, with his wife, Katrina vanden Heuvel, co-authored Voices of Glasnost: Interviews With Gorbachev‚Äôs Reformers (1989). In a March 1991 op-ed for The New York Times, he wrote that Gorbachev's government \\"has undertaken the most ambitious changes in modern history. Their goal is to 'dismantle' the state controls Stalin imposed and to achieve an 'emancipation of society' through privatization, democratization, and federalization of the 15 republics.\\" He acknowledged that perestroika was then in crisis, but he stated: \\"Russia has come closer to democracy than ever before. Though democratization remains exceedingly fragile, how can this be dismissed as a failure?\\" Cohen wrote that the US continued the Cold War after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. He claimed that President Bill Clinton backtracked on the promise of his predecessor not to extend NATO eastward and the flawed interpretation of an \\"American victory\\" and a \\"Russian defeat\\", which he believed in 2006 led US leaders to believe that Russia would submit completely to US foreign policy. Cohen was a friend of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who invited him to attend the 1989 May Day parade in Red Square, and advised former U.S. President George H. W. Bush in the late 1980s. Cohen helped Nikolai Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, to rehabilitate her name during the Soviet era. =Putin era= In an article for The Nation, published in the March 3, 2014 issue, he made an accusation of \\"media malpractice\\" resulting in the \\"relentless demonization of Putin\\", and disputed the Russian president's reputation as an \\"autocrat\\". He believed that the American media's coverage of Russia was \\"less objective, less balanced, more conformist and scarcely less ideological\\" than it had been during the Cold War. Cohen participated in a Munk Debate in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in April 2015, on the proposal \\"Be it resolved the West should engage not isolate Russia.\\" With Vladimir Posner, he argued in favor of engagement, while Anne Applebaum and Garry Kasparov argued against. Cohen's side lost the debate, with 52% of the audience voting against the motion. In a July 2015 interview, Cohen said: > Even Henry Kissinger‚ÄîI think it was in March 2014 in The Washington > Post‚Äîwrote this line: 'The demonization of Putin is not a policy. It's an > alibi for not having a policy.' And then I wrote in reply to that: That's > right, but it‚Äôs much worse than that, because it's also that the > demonization of Putin is an obstacle to thinking rationally, having a > rational discourse or debate about American national security. And it‚Äôs not > just this catastrophe in Ukraine and the new Cold War; it's from there to > Syria to Afghanistan, to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to fighting > global terrorism. The demonization of Putin excludes a partner in the > Kremlin that the U.S. needs, no matter who sits there. In May 2014 Nation column coauthored with his wife, Cohen claimed that President Barack Obama had unilaterally declared a new Cold War against Russia and that those inside the Beltway were complicit in it by their silence. Julia Ioffe in The New Republic saw this as Cohen disagreeing with a consensus that did not exist. In an interview with Tucker Carlson on May 17, 2017, Cohen said: \\"You and I have to ask a subversive question: are there really three branches of government, or is there a fourth branch of government ‚Äî these intel services?\\" He stated that a military alliance that President Obama had tried to establish with Putin against terrorism was \\"sabotaged by the Department of Defense and its allies in the intelligence services\\". Each of Trump's efforts to \\"cooperate with Russia\\" was \\"thwarted [by] a new leak of a story\\". Cohen's views on US-Russian relations were criticized by Julia Ioffe and others as being pro-Putin. Ioffe's assessment was, in turn, criticized in The American Conservative by James W. Carden, the executive director of the American Committee for East‚ÄìWest Accord (ACEWA). =Ukraine crisis= Cohen said that President Vladimir Putin's handling of the Ukrainian crisis, his annexation of Crimea, and his support for rebel fighters in the east were in reaction to the aggressive behavior of the United States and its allies, when they supported the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych. In a June 30, 2014 article in The Nation, Cohen criticized the US political-media establishment for being silent about \\"Kiev's atrocities\\" in the Donbass region. Cohen stated that even if Putin's reaction was aggressive, the US should immediately negotiate with Russia to avoid escalation of the conflict. In a 2015 interview, Cohen said that \\"this notion that this is all Putin‚Äôs aggression, or Russia‚Äôs aggression, is, if not 100-percent false, let us say, for the sake of being balanced and ecumenical, it's 50-percent false. And if Washington would admit that its narrative is 50-percent false, which means Russia's narrative is 50-percent correct, that's where negotiations begin and succeed.\\" Cohen called Ukraine \\"a country that has long been deeply divided by ethnic, linguistic, religious, cultural, economic and political differences.\\" He referred to Russia's annexing of Crimea in 2014 as part of a civil war and stated \\"one part tilts toward Russia and one part tilts toward the West\\". Cohen also disputed evidence that Russia shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, an atrocity that killed all 298 passengers and crew. He said the Ukrainian government had possession of Russian Buk surface-to-air missiles, and suggested the country \\"was playing with its new toys and made a big mistake.\\" Before the Ukraine crisis, Cohen believed \\"Putin was the best potential partner we had anywhere in the world to pursue our national security\\". In a CNN interview around March 2014, he said Putin was not \\"anti-American\\". His views on Ukraine were criticized and described as pro-Putin and pro-Kremlin. Cohen rejected such labels. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, Cohen's writings for The Nation also helped lead to \\"[s]taffers at The Nation [...] openly revolting against the magazine's pro-Russian tilt.\\" Historian Timothy Snyder disputed Cohen's assertion that the Ukrainian prime minister described the government's adversaries as \\"subhuman\\". Snyder wrote that the prime minister, in a message of condolence to families of killed Ukrainian soldiers, described the attackers as \\"inhuman\\" and suggested that the origin of Cohen's assertion was Russian media mistranslation of neliudy (\\"inhuman\\") as nedocheloveki (\\"subhuman\\").The road to unfreedom : Russia, Europe, America, Timothy Snyder, 2018 pp. 210-211 =Affiliations= In 2015, a proposed deal with the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) for a fellowship that would bear Cohen's name caused controversy and was initially revoked after some ASEEES members objected to it.\\"Stephen Cohen, Preeminent Scholar, Now Seen As Putin Apologist\\", RFE/RL, May 6, 2015 Following a special meeting in May 2015, the board of ASEEES explained that it voted in favor of accepting \\"the Cohen‚ÄìTucker Fellowship as named, should the gift be re-offered\\" and the establishment of the Cohen‚ÄìTucker fellowship programme was announced shortly afterwards. Also in 2015, Cohen with Gilbert Doctorow and others reestablished the American Committee for East‚ÄìWest Accord, which describes itself as a pro d√©tente advocacy group. From 2015, Cohen was a member of the board of directors of the revived ACEWA. He appeared regularly on RT (formerly known as Russia Today). Personal life and death Cohen had a son and a daughter from his first marriage in 1962 to opera singer Lynn Blair, whom he later divorced. In 1988, Cohen married political journalist and magazine publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, daughter of Jean Stein and William vanden Heuvel; the couple had a daughter. Cohen died from lung cancer on September 18, 2020, at his home in New York City, at the age of 81. Bibliography =Books= War with Russia? From Putin and Ukraine to Trump and Russiagate.

The vessels did not inflict significant damage on each other, however the battle is notable for seeing the first combat use of the torpedo. Background In May 1877, Nicol√°s de Pi√©rola, former Minister of Finance initiated an attempt to overthrow then Peruvian President Mariano Ignacio Prado. As part of this coup attempt, on the 6th of May two of his supporters, Colonel Lorranaga and Major Echenique boarded the Hu√°scar at the port of Callao while the captain and executive officer where ashore. Officers remaining on the ship were part of the plot and persuaded the crew to join their cause. Now in rebel hands, the Hu√°scar put to sea with Luis Germ√°n Astete in command. Other Peruvian naval ships present in the port, such as the Atahualpa were in a state of disrepair and unable to pursue. The rebels used the ship to harass commercial shipping especially off El Callao, the main commercial port of Peru. However, after she forcibly boarded some British merchant ships, British authorities sent Rear Admiral Algernon de Horsey to capture the vessel. Battle The Peruvian warship managed to escape after a fierce exchange of fire. Hu√°scars guns were undermanned, and she fired just 40 rounds. Shahs mast was damaged by splinters. On the British side, Shah fired 237 shots and Amethyst 190, but none of them carried armour-piercing ammunition. Hu√°scar was hit 60 times, but her armour shield caused all the shots to harmlessly bounce off. There was a last-ditch effort mounted to sink the rebel warship when two small torpedo rams from Shah attempted to torpedo the Hu√°scar, but the Peruvian ship managed to escape under the cover of darkness. The rebel crew was forced to surrender their ship to the Peruvian government just two days later. This battle saw the first use of the newly invented self-propelled torpedo which, at the time, had just entered limited service with the Royal Navy. The torpedo was dodged by the rebel monitor.

Pogonomyrmex Harvester Ants: a study of the genus in North America. University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville, TN. Description The genus name originated from the Greek language and refers to a beard-like structure, the psammophore, below the head (Greek œÄœéŒ≥œâŒΩ/p≈çg≈çn, \\"beard\\" + ŒºœçœÅŒºŒ∑Œæ/murmƒìx, \\"ant\\"), which can be found in most species of the subgenus sensu stricto. The psammophore is used for gathering small seeds, helping to increase the efficiency of transportation of fine sand and pebbles during nest construction, or to carry eggs. However, this structure is missing in species of the subgenus Ephebomyrmex (Greek ·ºîœÜŒ∑Œ≤ŒøœÇ/ephƒìbos, \\"beardless lad\\"), and these species generally have smaller individuals and colonies. Venom Pogonomyrmex (sensu stricto) workers have the most toxic venom documented in any insects, with Pogonomyrmex maricopa being the most toxic tested thus far. It has an of only 0.12 mg/kg, compared to western honey bee venom, at 2.8 mg/kg, and comparable to cobra venom. The venom is presumed to be an antivertebrate defense, specifically against predators that have evolved to selectively feed on them such as horned lizards. Very few insects have had the toxicity of their venoms formally tested, and other insects likely have more potent venoms. Nests These ants dig very deep nests with many underground chambers in which they keep seeds, from which they derive food for their larvae. The areas around most Pogonomyrmex (sensu stricto) nests tend to be utterly devoid of vegetation, and are easily seen from a distance. Predation In addition to horned lizards, predatory wasps in the genus Clypeadon feed only on Pogonomyrmex workers, paralyzing them with their venom, and carrying them back to a burrow where they will serve as food for the wasp's larva.

It now has a mostly derogatory connotation, describing what is seen as an antiquated female role model in contemporary Western society. The phrase is vaguely equivalent to the American \\"barefoot and pregnant\\", the British Victorian era \\"A woman's place is in the home\\" or the phrase \\"Good Wife, Wise Mother\\" from Meiji Japan.  The origins  The origins of the phrase are normally attributed to either the last German Emperor Wilhelm II, or to his first wife, Empress Augusta Victoria. She is likely to have adopted it from one of several similar German \\"sayings by number\\". The most suggestive of these is listed in the second volume of German proverbs Glossary: A Treasury for the German People published in 1870 by Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander: \\"Four K's are requisite of a pious woman, namely, that she keeps regard for church, chamber, kitchen, children.\\" Wander refers for the origins of this saying to a 16th-century commentary on Sirach by Johannes Mathesius. He also lists another similar phrase: \\"A good housewife has to take care of five K: chamber, kids, kitchen, cellar, clothes,\\" which appeared first in the 1810 collection of German proverbs. by Johann Michael Sailer. In 1844 \\"The newspaper for the German Nobility\\" published this latter saying in its traditional last page \\"feature\\" short statements. The phrase started to appear in its current form in writing in the early 1890s. \\"After Germany, where women apparently take no interest in public affairs, and seem to obey to the letter the young emperor's injunction 'Let women devote themselves to the three K's,' (kitchen, church, and children), the active interest and influence of English women on all great questions were refreshing.\\" wrote Marie C. Remick in A Woman's Travel-notes on England in 1892. The phrase then was used multiple times throughout the 1890s in liberal writing and speeches. In August 1899 the influential British liberal Westminster Gazette elaborated on the story, mentioning, as well, the 4th \\"K\\". A story titled \\"The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's\\"The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's, in: Westminster Gazette, 17. 8. 1899, S. 6. describes an audience given by the Kaiser to two American suffragettes. After hearing them out, the Kaiser replies: \\"I agree with my wife. And do you know what she says? She says that women have no business interfering with anything outside the four K's. The four K's are ‚Äì Kinder, K√ºche, Kirche, and Kleider: Children, Kitchen, Church, and Clothing\\".Paletschek, Sylvia, Kinder ‚Äì K√ºche ‚Äì Kirche Kaiser's 4 K's is encountered again in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1911 book The man-made world. The \\"3 K's\\" variation has remained by far more popular and well known.  Third Reich  The Third Reich made women and mothers a priority in their political rhetoric. Many women supported the National Socialist Party because it urged returning to the family values of the past when women were encouraged to stay at home and concern themselves with taking care of the household. Barbara Kosta argues that, to some, the modern woman of Weimar was viewed as an insult to previous conceptions of Germanic motherhood, and womanhood in general. When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, he introduced a Law for the Encouragement of Marriage, which entitled newly married couples to a loan of 1000 marks (around 9 months' average wages at that time). On their first child, they could keep 250 marks. On their second, they could keep another 250. They reclaimed all of the loan by their fourth child. In a September 1934 speech to the National Socialist Women's Organization, Hitler argued that for the German woman her \\"world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home\\",Doramus, Max, The Complete Hitler. A Digital Desktop Reference to His Speeches & Proclamations, 1932-1945 (Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 1990), 532 a policy which was reinforced by the stress on \\"Kinder\\" and \\"K√ºche\\" in propaganda, and the bestowing of the Cross of Honor of the German Mother on women bearing four or more babies. During this period, women were discriminated against in employment and forced out or bribed with numerous social benefits. Medicine, the law and civil service were occupations reserved for men alone.Spartacus Educational In one of his essays, T. S. Eliot reproduces and then comments upon a column in the Evening Standard of May 10, 1939 headed Back to the Kitchen' Creed Denounced\\": During World War II in Germany, women eventually were put back in the factories because of the growing losses in the armed forces and the desperate lack of equipment on the front lines.  Post-World War II  The phrase continued to be used in feminist and anti-feminist writing in the English-speaking world in the 1950s and 1960s.

He studied medicine with his father in Shiraz and taught a number of students himself. Early in his career he was in the service of the governor of Shirvan, during which time he incurred the governor's wrath, for which he received the punishment of spending one night outdoors in the cold and snow. ‚ÄòImad al-Din Mahmud Shirazi resorted to opium during that night, and, although he recovered from the immediate effects of the cold, he had a tremor for the rest of his life. He became an opium-eater (afyuni), convinced of the therapeutic value of opium. Reflecting his own experience, ‚ÄòImad al-Din Mahmud Shirazi wrote a treatise in Persian on the medical and addictive properties of opium and its use in compound remedies. The National Library of Medicine has a copy of this treatise that was made in Kerman in 1591, possibly during the author's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Another copy of this 16th-century Persian manuscript scribed between 1737 and 1744 is extant in the Library of Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences. ‚ÄòImad al-Din Mahmud Shirazi also composed the first Persian-language monograph on syphilis and an important treatise on China root (chub-i chini), the rhizome of an Old World species of smilax found in eastern Asia and advocated for the treatment of syphilis. In Arabic, he wrote a treatise on compound remedies and a monograph on anatomy. Early modern European influence can be seen in many of these medical writings.

It was written prior the conception of the Sprawl universe in which several of Gibson's novels and stories are set, taking place in a setting much more like contemporary American life. Plot summary The main character is Coretti, a dull, scholarly man who studies and teaches linguistics and social interaction theory. He sometimes visits bars to help dull the tedium, only choosing bars which have a low chance of putting him in social interaction. Coretti meets a woman in a bar who seems to fit perfectly there. He follows her to various other bars and clubs, watching as she constantly drinks and talks with a companion of hers, her appearance and clothing shifting to let her fit in wherever she goes. His performance at work suffers and his appetite decreases as he devotes all his time and resources to tracking the duo. Coretti spots the man secreting money from some kind of pocket, and realizes that he has discovered a new kind of creature, one that has adapted to modern society more completely than any cockroach, fueled by the alcohol of a hundred bars. The story closes with Coretti's realization that he is, and finally his transformation into, one of the belonging kind.

Family Beant Singh was born in a Ramdasia Sikh family to Baba Sucha Singh and Kartar Kaur. Singh's widow Bimal Kaur Khalsa initially joined the Sikh militant group, and then got imprisoned. Later she got elected from Ropar Constituency. His father, Baba Sucha Singh, was also elected member of Lok Sabha from Bathinda (Lok Sabha constituency). Their son, Sarbjit Singh is a leader of SAD (Mann). Assassination of Indira Gandhi Operation Blue Star left a deep mark in the thinking of Beant Singh and Satwant Singh, both part of the Indian Elite Forces who served as bodyguards for Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Satwant Singh always worked the late shifts and Beant Singh worked the early morning shifts as the Prime Minister's security. On 31 October 1984, Satwant Singh faked a stomach illness and swapped duties with another guard so that they could work together to execute their plan. That morning, at approximately 9:00 AM, as Gandhi walked from her house, Singh drew a shotgun and fired three shots into Gandhi's abdomen. As she fell to the ground, Satwant Singh fired all 30 rounds from his Sten submachine gun into her body. Singh was shot to death during interrogation in custody shortly after the assassination took place. Satwant Singh was arrested and later sentenced to death along with co-conspirator Kehar Singh. The sentence was carried out on 6 January 1989. Beant Singh's act generated political support for Sikh radicals, resulting in their winning two Lok Sabha seats in the state of Punjab.

Headquartered in Covington, Kentucky, the company traces its roots back to the city of Ashland, Kentucky, where it was headquartered from 1924 to 1999. The company currently has five wholly owned divisions, which include Chemical Intermediates and Solvents, Composites, Industrial Specialties, Personal and Home Care, & Pharmaceuticals, Food and Beverage, and Agriculture. Until 2017, the company was the primary manufacturer of Valvoline. History =Founding and early years= Ashland was founded in 1924 as the Ashland Refining Company in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, by Paul G. Blazer. In October 1923, J. Fred Miles of the Swiss Oil Company of Lexington, Kentucky. employed Paul G. Blazer and assigned him the task of locating, purchasing and operating a refinery in northeastern Kentucky. Mr. Blazer selected a location on the banks of the Big Sandy River approximately two miles south of the Ohio River near the community of Leach Station. One mile south of the city of Catlettsburg, the site contained an existing refinery which was purchased by Blazer which had been in operation since 1916. The Catlettsburg site was advantageous due to its location near the Ohio River and offered an efficient means of transportation for the fledgling company. With funds supplied by Swiss Oil, Blazer arranged to buy, at a price of $212,500, the small unprofitable 1,000 barrel per day refinery of Great Eastern Refining Company which had been owned by coal operators in Huntington, West Virginia. With the purchase of the refinery came a small towboat and oil barge. On February 2, 1924, alvin and three Swiss Oil executives incorporated Ashland Refining Company, with a capital of $250,000. They took over the operations of the Catlettsburg Refinery which had twenty-five employees who were working seven days per week and twelve hours per day. Blazer moved from Lexington to Ashland. The only member of the Swiss Oil organization to come to Ashland with Blazer was Ashland Refining Company's first treasurer, William Waples. Ashland's refinery operations in Catlettsburg proved to be successful even from the very first month. Wages were increased and the hours of work were reduced. After making repairs and purchasing some new, modern equipment, the refinery soon had output of 500,000 barrels a year and sales of $1,300,000. In only a few years, the Ashland Refining Company began to show larger returns than the parent company. Ashland Refining Co. grew rapidly through both internal expansion and acquisitions including Union Gas and Oil Company (1925), Tri-State Refining Company (1930), and Cumberland Pipeline Company (1931). By 1933, Ashland Refining Company owned more than 1,000 wells, 800 miles of pipelines, bulk distribution plants in twelve cities, service stations, river transportation terminals and river equipment. In 1936, under Blazer's leadership, the company's ownership changed from Swiss Oil to the Ashland Oil and Refining Company shareholder group and was headquartered in Ashland, Kentucky. Blazer was appointed chief executive officer of the company. Blazer's success as manager was recognized by major stockholders. They gave him the power to run Ashland as his own operation, though at no point during his tenure as chief executive officer (1936‚Äì1957) did he own a controlling interest in the company. Blazer's philosophy of supporting the well-being of company employees was evident early on. Two of his early changes were offering employees' sick leave with full pay, and in 1947 the introduction of an employee profit-sharing plan. This move made the company one of the first in the region to offer such benefits. Blazer supported creative arts and invited nearby Greenup County educator and internationally acclaimed author Jesse Stuart to open each annual meeting with a story, a poem, or a bit of humor. He also was a pastor at his local church. =Post- World War II= After the end of World War II, Ashland teamed with Sperry Corporation to develop the introduction of radar on commercial river vessels and teamed with various shipyards to develop the integrated tow. The \\"jumbo\\" tank barge of 195 ft. by 35 ft. became the industry standard and was used by Ashland. Under Blazer's control, the company grew to become a Forbes 500 company by relying on barges to bring in crude oil and deliver refined products to independent marketers. In the process, Ashland soon operated the nation's largest inland towing fleet and in 1953 the Port of Huntington- Tristate exceeded Pittsburgh as the busiest port on the Ohio River and the busiest inland port in the United States, a title it retains to date. Ashland Oil & Refining Company also grew through many acquisitions such as the Allied Oil Company (1948), Cleveland and Lakeland Tankers (1948), Aetna Oil Company (1949), Freedom-Valvoline Company (1950), Frontier Oil of Buffalo (1950) and National Refining Company (1950). By 1953, Ashland Oil and Refining Company had 3,518 miles of crude oil pipelines, 252 miles of product lines, six refineries processing an average of 124,000 barrels a day, operated nine tow boats on the inland waterways, and owned over 100 barges. Although still involved as chairman of Ashland's Finance Committee and Executive Committee, Blazer stepped down as chief executive officer in 1957. Louisville Refining Company was purchased in 1959. United Carbon was purchased in 1963. In 1966, Ashland Oil and Refinery Company Inc.'s sales had grown to $699,000,000. Diversification continued with the purchase of Warren Brothers in 1966, which later was to become Ashland Paving and Construction. A major leap into the chemical industry occurred in 1967 when Ashland purchased ADM Chemical Group. This chemical distribution segment of the business would go on to be one of the primary functions of the company in the later part of the 20th century. In 1969, the company reorganized to form Ashland Petroleum with Robert T. McCowan as its first president, as well as entering into a joint venture in Coal mining under the name Arch Mineral. =1980s-1990s= In the 1980s and early 1990s, Ashland continued to expand buying The Permian Corporation which it merged with Scurlock Oil Company in 1991 to form a subsidiary known as Scurlock Permian Corporation. In 1992, most of Unocal's chemical distribution business was acquired, making Ashland the top chemical distributor in North America. At this time, the Industrial Chemicals & Solvents (IC&S;) division was established. The company's name was changed from \\"Ashland Oil, Incorporated\\" to the present \\"Ashland Inc.\\" in 1995, which noted the reduced importance of oil in the overall business. In 1998, the petroleum division merged with Marathon Oil to form Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC (MAP). Following that in 1999, Ashland was #102 on the Forbes list of Fortune 500 companies when it agreed to sell its Scurlock Permian subsidiary to Plains All American Pipeline and the headquarters were moved from Ashland to Covington, Kentucky, although the company maintained an office building in Russell, adjacent to Ashland. A monumental change came in 2005, when Ashland sold its shares of the petroleum joint venture to Marathon Oil, effectively dissolving the remnants of their petroleum division. After the sale, the company was no longer involved in the refining or marketing of fuels. The original oil refinery in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, is still in operation to date, owned and operated by Marathon. In 2006, Ashland sold APAC (the paving and construction division) to the Oldcastle Materials subsidiary of Oldcastle Inc. of Dublin, Ireland. =Recent years= Ashland purchased the adhesive and emulsions divisions of Air Products & Chemicals in 2008.Ashland buys business for $92M  Cincinnati Enquirer  Cincinnati.Com Ashland announced plans to acquire Hercules Inc. on July 11, 2008, for $3.3B. On November 13, 2008, the transaction was completed. In July 2010 Ashland merged its foundry chemicals activity with S√ºd-Chemie of Munich, Germany, to form ASK Chemicals L.P. with headquarters in Dublin, Ohio. In November 2010 Ashland announced plans to sell its distribution business known as Ashland Distribution to TPG Capital for $930 Million. The Ashland Distribution business had been a part of Ashland since 1969. With revenues of $3.4 billion, the Ashland Distribution business had approximately 2,000 employees across North America and Europe, and entered the China plastics market in 2009. The sale was finalized April 1, 2011, with a final sale price of US$979 million. The new privately held company is named Nexeo Solutions. In May 2011 Ashland announced that it had bought the privately owned company International Specialty Products Inc. (ISP) for $3.2 billion. ISP is a supplier of specialty chemicals and performance-enhancing products for consumer and industrial markets. In 2014, Ashland Water Technologies was sold to a private equity buyer. In May 2017, Ashland separated its Valvoline business as Valvoline Inc. (NYSE:VVV), the final step of reorganizing itself as a global specialty chemicals company. In January 2019, Ashland struck a deal with activist investor Cruiser Capital Advisors, which had planned to mount a proxy fight to replace four board directors. Instead, the two parties reached an agreement involving a consulting role for one of Cruiser's director nominees and more input regarding future board appointees. In October 2019, Ashland announced Guillermo Novo would succeed William A. Wulfsohn as Chairman and CEO.

Assassination The motivation for the assassination of Indira Gandhi was revenge for the military attack carried out by the Indian government on Harmandir Sahib, in Amritsar, India. Harmandir Sahib was occupied by the Sikh militants Bhindranwale. The militants were flushed out and Bhindranwale was killed during the operation. The operation also caused damage to the temple premises and casualties on both sides which angered the Sikhs. Beant Singh drew a .38 revolver and fired three shots into Indira Gandhi's abdomen; as she fell to the ground, Satwant Singh fired all 30 rounds from his Sten automatic weapon into her abdomen (thus, 33 bullets were fired in total, of which 30 bullets hit her). Both assassins subsequently dropped their weapons and surrendered.Cynthia Keppley Mahmood, Beant Singh was shot to death during interrogation in custody soon after the assassination. Satwant Singh was arrested and later sentenced to death by hanging along with co-conspirator Kehar Singh. The sentence was carried out on 6 January 1989. During the Supreme Court trial, Satwant Singh, a former club wrestler from Amritsar, made the following statement \\"Let any part of my body, after my Shaheedi [\\"martyrdom\\"], removed and used by anyone who may need. However, if you need my eyes, let the authorities tell my parents. I have no hatred for any Hindu, Muslim, Christian, neither hatred for any religion. After my Shaheedi, let no Sikh throw any rock at any Hindu. I am not in favour of any retaliation or bloodshed over my Shaheedi. If we do create bloodshed, then there is no difference between us and Rajiv Gandhi. I am Proud of the task that I did! I do ardas [prayer] in front of Waheguru! If I am blessed with a human life, then give me a death of the Brave when I am hanged. Forget one life, if I could I would give up a thousand lives to kill dushts [thugs] like Indira Gandhi, and laugh as I become Shaheed [a martyr] by hanging....\\" Aftermath The assassination of Gandhi brought their immediate families into the limelight, resulting in their winning two Lok Sabha seats from state of Punjab. The Lok Sabha is a directly elected 543 member lower house of the Parliament of India. It was reported in the Indian press that during the aftermath of the executions of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, communal violence occurred in Punjab. Honours In 2003, a Bhog ceremony was held at the highest Sikh temporal seat in Akal Takht, located in the Golden Temple Complex in Amritsar, where tributes were paid to Indira Gandhi's assassins. In 2004, the anniversary of his death was again observed at Akal Takhat, Amritsar, where his mother was honored by the head priest and tributes were paid to Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh by various political parties. In 2007, the death anniversaries of Satwant Singh and his wife were observed in various parts of Punjab and other countries. On 6 January 2008, the Akal Takht declared Beant Singh and Satwant Singh \\"martyrs of Sikhism\\", while the SGPC also labeled them \\"martyrs of the Sikh nation\\". The Sikh-centric political party in India, Shiromani Akali Dal, observed the death anniversary of Beant Singh and Satwant Singh as \\"martyrdom\\" for the first time on 31 October 2008. Every 31 October since, this date has been observed at Sri Akal Takht Sahib. A film called Kaum de Heere was made about him in 2014. Personal life Singh's father was Tarlok Singh.

He or she digitally paints photo-realistic interior and exterior environments that could not have been otherwise created or visited. The term 'digital' is used to distinguish a DMP from a traditional matte painter, although this is unnecessary, as the nature of a matte painter's work remains the same, regardless of the tools and techniques used. Craig Barron, the co-founder of Matte World Digital, offered an insight regarding the transition of the art from traditional to digital in the following words: > It is difficult to categorize what a matte painting shot is today... Most > filmmakers still call what we do matte shots, and we like that because we > see our work as an extension of the original craft. But it's more accurate > to say we are involved in environment creation.  From traditional to digital  Traditional matte painting is older than the movie camera itself and has actually been already practiced in the early years of photography to create painted elements in photographs. With the advantages of the digital age, matte painters have slowly transitioned to a digital work environment, using pressure-sensitive pens and graphic tablets in conjunction with a painting software such as Adobe Photoshop. A digital matte painter is part of a visual effects team being involved in post-production, as opposed to a traditional matte painter, who was a member of a special effects crew, often creating matte paintings on set to be used as backdrops. One particular drawback to the work of the digital matte artist is an occasional tendency of their output to look too realistic, which traditional artists avoided by using impressionistic elements or by suggesting details. What this means is that digital matte art is often characterized by an artificially perfect look. One of the modern approaches adopted to address this is the integration of details from a photograph, say, of real places to depict realistic scenes. It is this reason why some digital matte artists refer to their work as a combination of digital painting, photo manipulation, and 3D, for the purpose of creating virtual sets that are hard or impossible to find in the real world.  Workflow and skillset  The time period and extent of involvement of a digital matte artist in film production varies by the type of film and by the artist's supervisor's (film producer, film director, art director) intentions. However, there are artists such as Mathieu Raynault who stated that they are often brought into the production at a very early stage, providing sketches and concepts to get a dialogue started with the director or art director. Raynault was involved on films like 300, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, and two Lord of the Rings films, among others. Because of the growing need for 'moving' mattes, camera projection mapping has been implemented into the matte painting timeline. Although ILM CG Supervisor Stefen Fangmeier came up with the idea of projecting Yusei Uesugi's aerial painting of Neverland onto a 3D mesh modeled by Geoff Campbell while working on the motion picture Hook in 1991, projection-mapping based 3D environment matte art was until recently, like its predecessor matte painting has been, the industry's best- kept secret. The involvement of 3D in this until then 2D art form was revealed by Craig Barron in 1998 after completing their work on the feature film Great Expectations when they introduced this technique as a 2.5D matte to the public. In production today this combination of 2D and 3D is part of every matte artist's bread and butter. Because of their high artistic skills, digital matte artists are often also involved with the creation of concept artwork.

Early career Kevin Greening grew up in Bristol where he worked voluntarily for the Bristol Hospital Broadcasting Service and was educated at Bristol Grammar School. He later studied chemical engineering at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he was station manager at Cambridge University Radio. His first job was as a construction worker on the Humber Bridge. He then trained as a studio manager and began his broadcasting career at the BBC World Service. After a brief spell as a Programme assistant at BBC Radio Solent, in 1989 Greening joined London's Local station BBC GLR as a producer, before becoming a presenter of their Breakfast show in 1991. In April 1993, Greening joined the newly launched Virgin Radio, presenting a Friday and Saturday evening show and a Sunday morning show. After two months, he took over their weekday afternoon show, where he remained until he quit Virgin in December 1993. Radio 1 In January 1994, Greening joined BBC Radio 1, presenting the Weekend Breakfast Show (Saturday and Sunday 710am). In the summer of '94, Radio 1 agreed to cover the Gay Pride event for the first time and these reports into the general days' output were fronted by Greening; the success of these led to Radio 1 becoming a regular fixture at Gay Pride events. In May 1995 Greening was named in Gay Times' Top 200 Gay Men and Lesbians as an out gay DJ. In November 1994, Greening took over the Weekend Lunchtime show (Saturday and Sunday noon to 2pm). Again he featured many of his comedy characters (usually voiced by Andrew McGibbon) featured on Weekend Breakfast. October 1995 saw Greening move back to Weekend Breakfast where he would remain for another 16 months. Greening was given the Drivetime show in February 1997. Regular features on the show included the \\"Joke du Jour\\", \\"60 Second Cinema\\", and the \\"Evening Procession\\". Early mornings seemed to play a big role during Greening's time at Radio 1, as he had presented Weekend Breakfast and had also been the main stand-in presenter for Steve Wright, Chris Evans and Mark Radcliffe on the weekday breakfast show, but October 1997 saw Greening present The Radio 1 Breakfast Show alongside Zoe Ball, where he would remain for 12 months. Greening moved to a Sunday morning show from 6:30 to 10am in September 1998. At the time he was also presenting shows for BBC World Service and a TV show for digital station BBC Choice. It was during this period that Greening became the main stand-in presenter on the network, covering for many weekday presenters including Scott Mills, Simon Mayo and Mark Radcliffe. There was also a period when Greening took over the weekday lunchtime show whilst regular presenter Jo Whiley was away on maternity leave. He occasionally made light of his status as a stand-in presenter, giving an alternative email address as supply.dj@bbc.co.uk (his main address being kevin.greening@bbc.co.uk) On Sunday 16 January 2000, Greening presented his final Radio 1 show. In the last half-hour he played some of the sketches from his time with the station. Radio 5 Live Not long after he left Radio 1, in 2000 Greening moved to BBC Radio 5 Live, where he was a stand-in presenter for various daytime slots. In March 2001, whilst undertaking supply work at Five Live, he began co-presenting a Saturday Morning show on GLR's replacement, BBC London Live, alongside Amanda Hussain, the show went out from 8 to 11am on Saturday mornings and lasted until September the same year when the show was taken over by Danny Baker. Commercial radio From late 2001 into 2002, 102.2 Jazz FM employed him for various slots, then in May 2002, he briefly joined London's Heart 106.2 presenting their 26pm weekend afternoon show. In June 2002, he joined London's Rock station XFM, sitting in for Christian O'Connell on the Breakfast Show. One month later, he took over the station's mid-morning slot from 10am to 1pm, where he remained until December 2003. In January 2004, he was moved to the Station's Best of X show on Saturday evenings from 6 to 9pm. After a stand-in stint on the BBC Radio 6 Music Night Train programme, and in addition to his Saturday evening show on XFM in April 2004, he re-joined 102.2 Jazz FM to present a Sunday morning show from 10am to 2pm. Shortly after, he also took over from Clive Warren on Saturdays from 10am to 2pm. On 7 June 2005, he took over the 10am3pm slot on 102.2 Jazz FM's replacement, 102.2 Smooth FM. From 26 March 2007, he moved to a 14pm weekday afternoon slot on the relaunched 102.2 Smooth Radio where he built up a cult following. His \\"game with no name\\" quiz show, in which listeners had to suggest the most suitable song to play against a particular news item, was particularly popular. He also presented Saturday afternoons from 2 to 5pm on the station. Personal life Greening was awarded a Fellowship by The Radio Academy in 2001.The Radio Academy \\"Fellows\\" He was the only non-executive ever to be so honoured in the academy's 25 years. Greening was openly gay and had a previous long-term relationship with Andy Lowe, whom he often referred to on air as his \\"lesbian life-partner\\" or \\"live-in chum\\". When their relationship came to an end in 2005, after a brief separation they continued to share their house in north London. At the time of his death Greening had been in a relationship with Sean Griffin for some time. Death On 30 December 2007, it was announced by Chris North, Greening's agent, that Greening had \\"died peacefully in his sleep\\" one day before his 45th birthday. His boyfriend, Sean Griffin, was arrested the following day in connection with his death, and for possession of a Class A drug, but charges in relation to Greening's death were not pursued by police. On 3 January 2008, it was revealed following the post-mortem that Greening died of a heart attack after taking large quantities of cocaine, ecstasy and GHB. He had spent part of the night prior to his death at the Recon eventRecon is a fetish wear on-line store http://shop.recon.com with an associated social network http://www.recon.com held at The Arches nightclub in Southwark, London. Greening was buried on 18 January 2008 in a woodland burial ground after a secular humanist farewell ceremony in accordance with his wishes. At the inquest into his death, a verdict of death by misadventure was recorded as a result of a self-induced drug overdose during a bondage session.DJ Died After Gay Bondage Session Sky News After his death an award was named after him at the Student Radio Association's annual Student Radio Awards. The Kevin Greening Award is dedicated to recognising unique on-air creativity, for which Greening was known.

Note that, as profinite groups are compact, the open subgroups are exactly the closed subgroups of finite index, so that the discrete quotient group is always finite. Alternatively, one can define a pro-p group to be the inverse limit of an inverse system of discrete finite p-groups. The best-understood (and historically most important) class of pro-p groups is the p-adic analytic groups: groups with the structure of an analytic manifold over \\\\mathbb{Q}_p such that group multiplication and inversion are both analytic functions. The work of Lubotzky and Mann, combined with Michel Lazard's solution to Hilbert's fifth problem over the p-adic numbers, shows that a pro-p group is p-adic analytic if and only if it has finite rank, i.e. there exists a positive integer r such that any closed subgroup has a topological generating set with no more than r elements. More generally it was shown that a finitely generated profinite group is a compact p-adic Lie group if and only if it has an open subgroup that is a uniformly powerful pro-p-group. The Coclass Theorems have been proved in 1994 by A. Shalev and independently by C. R. Leedham-Green. Theorem D is one of these theorems and asserts that, for any prime number p and any positive integer r, there exist only finitely many pro-p groups of coclass r.

The Sagebrush Rebellion was a movement in the Western United States in the 1970s and the 1980s that sought major changes to federal land control, use, and disposal policy in 13 western states in which federal land holdings include between 20% and 85% of a state's area. Supporters of the movement wanted more state and local control over the lands, if not outright transfer of them to state and local authorities and/or As much of the land in question is sagebrush steppe, supporters adopted the name \\"Sagebrush Rebellion.\\" The movement continues to have support by persons interested in developing the lands for resource extraction and private benefits, such as livestock grazing, mineral extraction, and timber harvesting. Opponents place higher value on private economic benefits by recreation and societal benefits of open space and hard-to-quantify economic benefits of ecosystem services. Background The term \\"Sagebrush Rebellion\\" was coined during fights over designation of National Wilderness lands, especially in western states, especially after the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management conducted required surveys of plots of public lands of at least that had had roads removed after 1972 for the potential designation as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The process was known as the \\"Roadless Area Review and Evaluation\\" (RARE, or later, RARE I). The RARE process developed significant opposition from both environmental groups and public lands users and was challenged in federal court. The results of RARE I were nullified by the courts for lack of uniform criteria for evaluation of lands and other procedural problems. A second review started in 1977, known as RARE II, and involved more than 60 million acres (24 million km¬≤) of wildland under federal jurisdiction. RARE II was completed in 1979, but the effort was largely sidelined during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who was elected in 1980. Reagan declared himself a sagebrush rebel in an August 1980 campaign speech in Salt Lake City and told the crowd, \\"I happen to be one who cheers and supports the Sagebrush Rebellion. Count me in as a rebel.\\" Reagan faced opposition from conservation organizations. The struggle persists today after changing form with the \\"wise use movement\\" in 1988. Even so, Congress has designated several wilderness areas since 1981, sometimes by using data acquired through the RARE processes. The National Wilderness Preservation System grew out of recommendations of a Kennedy administration presidential commission, the Outdoor Recreational Resources Review Commission chaired by Laurence S. Rockefeller, whose 1962 report suggested legislation to protect recreational resources in a \\"national system of wild and scenic rivers,\\" a national wilderness system, a national trails system, the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, and recreation areas administered by existing public lands agencies beyond National Parks and National Monuments, both of which are administered in the Department of the Interior by the National Park Service. Much of the wildland was sagebrush, which some wanted to use for grazing, off-road vehicle use, and other development, instead of wilderness conservation. These \\"rebels\\" urged that instead of designating more federal wilderness protection, some or much of the land should be granted to states or private parties. They took on the phrase \\"Sagebrush Rebellion\\" to describe their opposition to federal management of the lands. Public lands history Map of US federal lands. Complaints about federal management of public lands constantly roil relations between public lands users (ranchers, miners, researchers, off-road vehicle enthusiasts, hikers, campers and conservation advocates) and the agencies and environmental regulation on the other. Ranchers complain that grazing fees are too high and that grazing regulations are too onerous despite environmentalist complaints that the opposite is true and that promised improvements to grazing on federal lands do not occur. Miners complain of restricted access to claims, or to lands to prospect. Researchers complain of the difficulty of getting research permits, only to encounter other obstacles in research, including uncooperative permit-holders and, especially in archaeology, vandalized sites with key information destroyed. Off-road vehicle users want free access, but hikers and campers and conservationists complain grazing is not regulated enough and that some mineral lease holders abuse other lands or that off-road vehicle destroy the resource. Each complaint has a long history. Among the first pieces of legislation passed following independence was the Land Ordinance of 1785, which provided for the surveying and sale of lands in the area created by state cessions of western land to the national government. Later, the Northwest Ordinance provided for the political organization of the Northwest Territories (now the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and part of northeastern Minnesota). To encourage settlement of western lands, Congress passed the first of several Homestead Acts in 1862, granting parcels in increments to homesteaders who could maintain a living on land for a period of time. Congress also made huge land grants to various railroads working to complete a transcontinental rail system. Much of the latter grants intentionally included mineral and timber-rich lands so that the railroads could get financing to build. Again, the hypothesis was that the railroads would sell off the land to get money. Ultimately, however, it turned out that much land west of the Missouri River was not ecologically suited for homesteading because of mountainous terrain, poor soils, lack of available water, and other ecological barriers to significant settlement. By the early 20th century, the federal government held significant portions of most western states that had simply not been claimed for any use. Conservationists prevailed upon President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside lands for forest conservation and for special scientific or natural history interest. Much land still remained unclaimed even after such reserves had been initially set up. The US Department of the Interior held millions of acres in the western states, with Arizona and New Mexico joining the union by 1913. US President Herbert Hoover proposed to deed the surface rights to the unappropriated lands to the states in 1932, but the states complained that the lands had been overgrazed and would also impose a burden during the Great Depression's cash- strapped state budgets. The Bureau of Land Management was created to manage much of that land. Rebellion Various bills intended to transfer federal public lands to western states had been proposed after 1932, all of which failed to garner much attention, let alone action. Among key objections to such transfers were the increasing value to the federal treasury of mineral lease receipts and complaints that the \\"crown jewels\\" of the national lands holdings, the National Parks, could not be managed adequately or fairly by individual states. Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks were considered to be national treasures, and few legislators would concur with turning them over to the states. The spark that turned these complaints into a \\"rebellion\\" was the enactment in 1976 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which ended homesteading and so the federal government would retain control of the western public lands. The act sought to establish a system of land management by the Bureau of Land Management. The Act required the bureau to plan land use accommodating all users and specifically named ranching, grazing, and mining, but it also introduced formal processes to consider preservation of the land from those uses. The newly-elected Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) joined in land transfer legislation efforts in 1977 after loud complaints from ranchers and oilmen from Utah, coupled with strong support from several Utah county governments. By late 1979, Hatch was the legislator who was the most interested in land transfers. He sought to introduce a transfer bill that would get hearings and potential action. Upon the advice of members of the Utah Wilderness Commission, appointed by Utah Governor Scott Matheson, Hatch agreed to leave National Parks and National Monuments in federal hands, and he drafted a bill that would allow states to apply for control over selected parcels. With 16 cosponsors, he introduced the bill in 1979,, introduced 8/3/1979 by Senator Orrin Hatch and again in 1981. Partly because Hatch's bill dealt with major objections to previous bills, news outlets for the first time covered the bill as if it had a serious chance of passing. That started a two- year newspaper, radio, and television fight for the legislation. Ultimately, Hatch's bill got little more than press attention. The election of Ronald Reagan as president put a friend to the Sagebrush Rebels in the White House, James G. Watt, and his appointees slowed or stopped wilderness designation legislation. By Reagan's second term, the Sagebrush Rebellion was back to simmering on the back burner of federal land management agencies.

The Presidential suite gained its name during the Woodrow Wilson presidency (1913‚Äì1921) because on each of his political trips away from Washington, he would insist on having a hotel room conform to specific requirements for his visit. In the United States, Presidential Suites since have adhered by tradition to Woodrow Wilson's specifications. It must be south-facing in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing in the Southern Hemisphere, containing an \\"en-suite\\" bathroom and walk-in closet (in Wilson's era en-suite bathrooms were uncommon). Famous presidential suites can be found in the Plaza Hotel in New York City, and The Fairmont San Francisco. Royal suites can often signify that Royalty have stayed at that suite in the past. Royal suites are more common in hotels in countries with monarchies, such as the Ritz Hotel London. A very small number of hotels have both a Presidential and a Royal suite. In these instances, usually both suites are of a comparative size and price, but differ in style and facilities. Royal suites may be more classically furnished, while Presidential suites may be more modern in appearance. Presidential suites may have facilities such as a private conference room, while Royal suites may have a formal reception room instead.

They were active between 1971 and 1989, releasing more than twenty albums as well as six singles. Their highest-charting single is \\"Callin' Baton Rouge\\", which peaked at No. 37 on the U.S. country charts in 1989 and was a Top 5 country hit for Garth Brooks five years later. In 2020, the group were inducted into the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame.https://bluegrasstoday.com/2020-winners-of-the-international- bluegrass-music-awards/ Origin The origins of New Grass Revival lay in the Bluegrass Alliance, which Sam Bush (vocals, fiddle, guitar, mandolin) and Courtney Johnson (banjo, vocals) joined in 1970. At the time, the Alliance also featured bassist Ebo Walker and fiddler Lonnie Peerce. Within a year after Bush's and Johnson's arrival, Curtis Burch (dobro, guitar, vocals) joined the band. In 1972, Peerce left the band, and the remaining members decided to continue under the new name New Grass Revival. The band released their eponymous debut album The Arrival of the New Grass Revival later in 1972 on Starday Records. History =Separation from mainstream bluegrass= Other groups were also playing progressive bluegrass at the time, such as The Dillards, Eddie Adcock's II Generation, and the Country Gentlemen, but few did it with the flair of the New Grass Revival. At the time, bluegrass was a very tradition-bound music; bands were expected to have short hair and dress in matching outfits. The New Grass Revival bucked these traditions, with long hair, informal clothing, and performances of songs from a variety of genres, including music by Jerry Lee Lewis (\\"Great Balls of Fire\\"), the Beatles (\\"Get Back\\"; \\"I'm Down\\"), Bob Marley (\\"One Love/People Get Ready\\"), and protest songs (\\"One Tin Soldier\\"). This break from bluegrass tradition was not well received in some quarters‚Äîsome thought it wasn't the way Bill Monroe meant for Bluegrass to be played. \\"Our reason for doing the newer-type music wasn't pretentious or irreverent or sarcastic or disrespectful,\\" explained Curtis Burch. \\"We just felt like people were ready to see that you could really expand the sound, using those same instruments.\\" (Monroe was a fan of New Grass Revival.) In 1979, they became the backup group and opening act for Leon Russell, further alienating them from the mainstream bluegrass community. =First lineup (1972-1981)= After the release of their debut, Walker parted ways with the band, and the group replaced him with Butch Robins, who was with the band from July, 1973 to November, 1974. He was replaced by John Cowan, an Evansville, Indiana, native. This lineup was stable throughout the 1970s, recording a number of albums for Flying Fish Records. As their name suggested, New Grass Revival never played traditional bluegrass‚Äîall of the members brought elements of rock & roll, jazz, and blues to the group's sound. Consequently, certain portions of the bluegrass community scorned them, but they also gained a devoted following of listeners who believed they were moving the genre in a new, fresh direction. For example, they played regularly to sold-out shows at Amazingrace Coffeehouse in the Chicago metro area. =Second lineup (1981-1989)= In 1981 Johnson and Burch left the band, claiming they were tired of touring. Bush and Cowan continued the group, replacing them with virtuoso banjoist B√©la Fleck and guitarist Pat Flynn. These two moved the band to new musical heights. Fleck's compositions such as \\"Metric Lips\\", \\"Seven by Seven\\" and \\"Big Foot\\" were very well received as were Pat Flynn's \\"Do What You Gotta Do\\", \\"Lonely Rider\\" and \\"On The Boulevard\\". Pat Flynn also brought strong lead and harmony vocals to the group as well as a distinctive guitar style. In 1984 the group moved to Sugar Hill Records, and released their first album featuring the new lineup, On the Boulevard. In 1986 the band signed with EMI Records and released an eponymous album New Grass Revival, which proved to be their breakthrough into the mainstream. Two of the singles from the album, \\"What You Do to Me\\" and \\"Ain't That Peculiar\\" were minor hits on the country charts, and Fleck's showcase \\"Seven by Seven\\" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental. Hold to a Dream, released in 1987, was just as successful as its predecessor, featuring the hits \\"Unconditional Love\\" and \\"Can't Stop Now,\\" both of which nearly made the Top 40. In 1989, New Grass Revival released their third major-label album, Friday Night in America, which was yet another commercial success. \\"Callin' Baton Rouge\\" became their first Top 40 single, followed by the number 58 hit \\"You Plant Your Fields.\\" Even though the band was more popular than ever, Bush decided to pull the plug on the group after the release of Friday Night in America. Bush formed The Sam Bush Band, and Fleck went on to a successful and respected solo career. New Grass Revival reunion at beneficial concert for Courtney Johnson in 1996. From left: B√©la Fleck, Sam Bush, John Cowan, Curtis Burch. =After breakup= In 1993, Bush, Cowan, Fleck, and Flynn returned to the studio, to back Garth Brooks, on his recording of \\"Callin' Baton Rouge\\". Banjoist Courtney Johnson died of lung cancer in 1996 at age 56. Bush, Fleck, Cowan, and Burch reunited for one concert (September 24, 1996) at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee to benefit his widow. The concert included a number of musicians and groups, such as John Hartford, Hot Rize, Tim O'Brien, Vassar Clements, Del McCoury Band, Ricky Skaggs, Pete Rowan, Jerry Douglas and others. In 1997, when Garth Brooks was invited on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to perform \\"Do What You Gotta Do\\", a song written by Pat Flynn, he asked Flynn, Bush, Cowan, and Fleck to join him in performing it. Since that performance, Flynn has worked with both Cowan and Fleck, but not Bush. Likewise, Bush has also worked with Cowan and Fleck on numerous occasions. Bush and Cowan have also played with Burch. In April 2007, Bush, Fleck, Cowan, and Flynn stepped into the spotlight together during the Merlefest 20th Anniversary Jam and played the Townes Van Zandt song \\"White Freight Liner.\\" The single song reunion was the first time the four of them had played together in a decade.

History Over the years, Ithaca made numerous firearms, most notably the Ithaca Flues double barrel shotgun and the Ithaca 37 shotgun.http://www.shotgunlife.com/shotguns/guns/just-a- beat-up-old-ithaca-with-a-story-to-tell.html =Production= Ithaca became famous for building firearms based on expired patents owned by Remington Arms. They also purchased patents from other firearm designers. In 1895 Emil Flues was granted Patent # 546,516, for a double barrel shotgun with only three moving parts per barrel. Ithaca bought the patent in 1907 and upgraded the design to allow for mass production. With the Flues designed Ithaca double, which became the best selling American double of all time with more than 223,000 produced between 1908 and 1926, Ithaca effectively drove Remington out of the double gun market.http://www.shotgunlife.com/shotguns/guns/just-a-beat- up-old-ithaca-with-a-story-to-tell.html Ithaca also produced the M1911 pistol during World War II and the M3 Grease Gun during Korean War, both for the United States military. Its 12-gauge shotguns were the standard used by the Los Angeles Police Department and New York Police Department, and sold to the Royal Thai Army in the early 1980s to arm farmers against communist insurgents. Its hunting shotguns were known for their fine decorative work, typically waterfowl or hunting dogs. In 1989, Remington purchased a design from Ithaca, the Mag-10 shotgun, which they produced as the SP-10. Ithaca Gun Co. - Annie Oakley gun, 1916 Around 1877, brothers Lyman Cornelius and Leroy Smith went into business with William Henry Baker. They moved the W.H. Baker Company, which manufactured double- and triple-barreled shotguns, from Center Lisle, New York to Syracuse. In 1883, Baker and Leroy Smith left the company, moved to Ithaca, and established the original Ithaca Gun Company with several partners. The company was responsible for much of the early industry of Tompkins County, especially during World War I and World War II, and counted among its patrons John Philip Sousa, Annie Oakley, and Alfred Lee Loomishttp://www.shotgunlife.com/shotguns/guns/just-a-beat-up-old-ithaca-with- a-story-to-tell.html At the time Sousa was president of the American Trap Shooters Association and The Ithaca gun company named a shotgun in his honor, the Sousa Grade. Annie Oakley used an Ithaca Flues model in her competition and exhibition shooting. In 1917, Alfred Loomis and his brother-in-law, purchased 17,000 acres (69 km2) of Hilton Head Island, which they established as a private hunting preserve and purchased Ithaca shotguns for use by guests. Dwight D. Eisenhower and George C. Marshall also owned Ithaca double barrel shotgunshttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/08/20/seven- shotguns-that-conquered-the-rest/ff343d07-cd53-4238-9b50-7ffb0c723220/ =Lefever guns= The Lefever Arms Company (1883‚Äì1916) was a manufacturer of guns in Syracuse, New York founded by Daniel Myron LeFever (1835‚Äì1906) who was an American gun maker, popularly known as \\"Uncle Dan LeFever\\". He is best known as the inventor of the hammerless shotgun, first introduced in 1878. The company was in the business of gun manufacture until 1916 when they were incorporated with Ithaca Gun Company in Ithaca, New York who continued with the LeFever gun production until 1921. Although production of the LeFever Sidelock Model designed by Dan LeFever ended, the Ithaca gun company continued to use the LeFever name on Boxlock action double and single barrel guns, until 1941.http://lefevercollectors.com/index.php?p=1_14_Production-Dates =Fall creek= The original factory was located in the Fall Creek neighborhood of the city, on a slope later known as Gun Hill, where the nearby waterfall supplied the main source of energy for the plant. In later years, the company came under criticism regarding environmental pollution of Fall Creek, especially by lead, which led to a Superfund remediation effort. Various plans to demolish the derelict plant and to redevelop the land failed over the years due to the cost of remediation and community objection to construction proposals. The factory was condemned in March 2006 and only the smokestack remains. An apartment project has been proposed for the site. Despite having moved 6000 tons of lead-contaminated material between 2002 and 2004 at a cost of $4.8 million, it was still necessary to perform even more clean up at the superfund site in 2015. =Reorganization= The company was controlled by the Smith family until 1967, when it was sold to a Colorado company, Jerry Baldritch & Asso., which later, after buying 10X Clothing, Atlantic Dinghy, and American Fiberglass, became General Recreation, Inc. and in 1971(approx.) made a public stock offering on the NYSE. General Recreation encountered financial problems in the late 1970s, selling off all its subsidiaries except Ithaca Gun. After a failed attempt to move manufacturing to Colorado, it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in December 1978, shuttering the plant on December 20 for several months. General Recreation filed for bankruptcy a second time in September 1985. In 1987, new owners Ithaca Acquisition, Inc. moved manufacturing to King Ferry, New York. In 2005, it received a $150,000 development loan from Cayuga County, and in May of that year moved to larger facilities in Auburn. After being unable to facilitate an operational manufacturing facility in Auburn, the owners sold all of Ithaca's assets, trademarks, and manufacturing rights to the Marshalls from Upper Sandusky, Ohio. The physical goods were relocated to Floyd Marshall's 30+ years tool and die shop where all prints, programs, and processing were converted to CNC machine tools. Unable to secure state or local financing assistance with the startup conversion, the Marshalls were forced to sell the company.Ithaca Gun Company, 2013 Catalog, Page 4 (The Ithaca Gun Company: A Brief History) Retrieved 2013-09-01 Dave Dlubak purchased the company in June 2007, and it continues to operate in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.

Background and education Hans Kramers was born in Rotterdam. the son of Hendrik Kramers, a physician, and Jeanne Susanne Breukelman. In 1912 Hans finished secondary education (HBS) in Rotterdam, and studied mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden, where he obtained a master's degree in 1916. Kramers wanted to obtain foreign experience during his doctoral research, but his first choice of supervisor, Max Born in G√∂ttingen, was not reachable because of the first world war. Because Denmark was neutral in this war, as was the Netherlands, he travelled (by ship, overland was impossible) to Copenhagen, where he visited unannounced the then still relatively unknown Niels Bohr. Bohr took him on as a Ph.D. candidate and Kramers prepared his dissertation under Bohr's direction. Although Kramers did most of his doctoral research (on intensities of atomic transitions) in Copenhagen, he obtained his formal Ph.D. under Ehrenfest in Leiden, on 8 May 1919. Kramers greatly enjoyed music and could play the cello and the piano. Academic career After working for almost ten years in Bohr's group and becoming an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, Kramers left Denmark in 1926 and returned to the Netherlands. He became a full professor in theoretical physics at Utrecht University, where he supervised Tjalling Koopmans. In 1934 he left Utrecht and succeeded Paul Ehrenfest in Leiden. From 1931 until his death he held also a cross appointment at Delft University of Technology. Kramers was one of the founders of the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam.

It is located on Laurie Island, one of the South Orkney Islands (), at above sea level and from the coastline. Established by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition in 1903 and transferred to the Argentine government in 1904, the base has been permanently populated since, being one of six Argentine permanent bases in Argentina's claim to Antarctica, and the first permanently inhabited base in Antarctica. The nearest port is the Argentine city of Ushuaia, which is away. The base has 11 buildings and four main topics of research: continental glaciology, seismology, sea-ice-zone glaciology (since 1985) and meteorological observations (since 1903). Orcadas was the only station on the islands for 40 years until the British established a small summer base, Cape Geddes Station in Laurie Island in 1946, replaced by Signy Research Station in Signy Island in 1947. It also had the first radiotelegraph in the continent in 1927. The 11 buildings of the station house up to 45 people during the summer, and an average of 14 during winter. The scientific activities are carried out at the Laboratorio Ant√°rtico Mutidisciplinario en Base Orcadas (LABORC), the \\"Multidisciplinary Antarctic Labaoratory at Base Orcadas\\". History In 1903 Dr William S. Bruce's Scottish National Antarctic Expedition established Omond House, a meteorological station on Laurie Island. During the expedition, however, the crew became stuck in the ice and, unable to sail off, were trapped in the station for the winter. Bruce left the station in December of that year for Buenos Aires to fix the ship and obtain supplies, leaving meteorologist Robert C. Mossman in charge of the base to continue the observations. Bruce offered to the Government of President Julio Argentino Roca the transfer of the station and instruments for the sum of 5.000 pesos, on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission. He also offered to transport in his ship the appointed personnel back to the station. Bruce had informed the British officer William Haggard of his intentions in December 1903. On 29 December, Haggard sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister, Jos√© Terry, ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition. Roca submitted the matter to the Oficina Meteorol√≥gica Nacional (National Office of Meteorology) who advised him to accept the offer. On January 2, 1904, the installations were accepted through a presidential decree. The Scotia sailed back for Laurie Island on 14 January 1904 carrying on board Luciano H. Valette, from the Office of Zoology of the Ministry of Agriculture, Edgard C. Szmula, employee of the National Meteorological Office, and Hugo Acu√±a, from the Ministry of Livestock, who was also designated Postal Chief of the Orkney Islands by the Director General of the National Postal and Telegraphs Office, Manuel Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez. Mossman was left in charge of the expedition, along with William Smith as cook. In 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on the South Orkney Islands. On August 26, Haggard sent a letter to Foreign Minister Manuel Montes de Oca reminding him that South Orkneys Islands were British. The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year. Argentine government ignored the note, \\"considering it out of time\\". On March 30, 1927, naval non-commissioned officer Emilio Baldoni established the first radio telegraph link with Ushuaia. Up to that point, the Orcadas Base remained isolated from the rest of the world until the yearly relief arrived. The radio station (coded LRT in Argentina) allowed for a permanent communication link. The station depended on the Ministry of Agriculture until Argentine Navy relieved the crew with navy personnel on March 3, 1951. Formal transfer occurred on December 23, 1952, when by presidential decree the base was put under the Service of Maritime Hydrography as Destacamento Naval Orcadas (\\"Orcadas naval Detachment\\").  Climate Annual mean temperatures measured at Orcadas Base, 1901‚Äì2007 Under the K√∂ppen climate classification system, the station is located under a tundra climate (ET), very close to an ice cap climate (EF). The base is influenced by the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current that runs past the Weddell Sea and the strong westerly winds, creating a colder climate than the coastal areas in the northwestern parts of the Antarctic Peninsula. Weather conditions can vary widely from year to year and day to day since low pressure systems frequently pass through the islands, which influences the climate. Mean monthly temperatures range from in June to in February. In summer, the average high is while the average low is . During winter, the average high is while the average low is . Temperatures can occasionally rise above freezing during winter. When low pressure systems pass to the south of the base, they can result in exceptionally mild temperatures, with the highest temperature recorded being in 1987. However, when this occurs, the weather is stormy and cloudy with reduced visibility. In contrast, when low pressure systems pass to the north, it results in cold and dry conditions with good visibility, causing temperatures to fall to . Fog is a frequent occurrence in the base, averaging 110 days. This can vary from year to year with 1987 being the foggiest year when there were 252 days with fog to only 30 days with fog in 1963. Being located in the path of low pressure systems throughout the year, the base experiences high cloud cover, particularly in summer. December and January are the cloudiest months, averaging 29 cloudy days each month. Winters are less cloudy, averaging 20 cloudy days in June and July.

He is credited with the discovery of the Capel River. Frederick Ludlow was born in 1796. In 1828, he and his wife Mildred (\\"Kitty\\") emigrated to Western Australia as servants of Captain Mark John Currie, arriving in Perth on board the Parmelia in June 1829. In April 1830, Ludlow joined a group including the Molloys and the Bussells in forming a new settlement at Augusta. The following year, Ludlow walked from Augusta to Perth in company with John Kellam and John Welburn. Although much undiscovered land would have been traversed, no journal was kept so no discoveries were attributed to the men. In June 1834, Ludlow made the same journey, this time on his own. Ludlow kept a journal of his travels, and was consequently credited with the discovery of much new land. In particular, he is credited with the discovery of the Capel River, although he did not give it a name. Ludlow later took up land near Busselton, much of which is now known as the Ludlow Tuart Forest in the Tuart Forest National Park. Both the Ludlow River and the town of Ludlow are named after him.

The term likely originates from a method of hunting wild turkeys in which the hunter, coming upon a flock, intentionally scatters them. Once the flock is scattered, the hunter sets up and waits, as the scattered flock will return to that point individually, making them easy targets. Sport usage Besides a literal turkey hunt, the term \\"turkey shoot\\" may also refer to a shooting contest in which frozen turkeys are awarded as prizes. The shoot is most commonly held using shotguns aimed at paper targets about 25‚Äì35 yards away. Original turkey shoots, however, date at least to the time of James Fenimore Cooper and were contests in which live turkeys were tied down in a pen and shot from 25‚Äì35 yards. If the turkey died, the shooter received it as a prize. That gave rise to the military term (see below). Today, turkey shoots are still popular in the rural United States. The winner is chosen according to which target has a shot closest to its center crossmark. Due to the random nature of the exact pattern of pellets that a shotgun shoots, that removes almost all skill from the contest and allows every shooter an equal chance. Another contest, depicted in the 1941 Gary Cooper film Sergeant York, provided a caged turkey with a protective wall. Above the cage was a slot in which the turkey could raise its head. Single-shot rifles were used, and if the shooter was skilled and fast enough, the turkey was shot in the head, rewarding the shooter it as his prize. Military usage In military situations, a turkey shoot occurs when a group or team catch the enemy off-guard or outgunned to the point of being unfair, as in the following famous examples: *Charge of the Light Brigade ‚Äì Crimean War *Battle of the Crater ‚Äì American Civil War *Battle of the Philippine Sea ‚Äì World War II *Battle of Longewala ‚Äì Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 *Operation Mole Cricket 19 ‚Äì 1982 Lebanon War *Highway of Death ‚Äì Gulf War *Battle of Fallujah (2016) ‚Äì Iraqi Civil War (2014‚Äì2017) See also Meat shoot * Fish in a barrel  References  English phrases Shooting sports ","title":"Turkey shoot"},{"id":"1842158","text":"Janusz Kulig's funeral procession Obelisk next to level crossing in Rzezawa (Poland), dedicated to Janusz Kulig Janusz Kulig (October 19, 1969 in ≈Åapan√≥w near Krak√≥w ‚Äì February 13, 2004 in Rzezawa near Bochnia, Poland) was a Polish rally driver. He started his career behind the wheel of a Polski Fiat 126p and during his early years in rally he also drove a Toyota Corolla, an Opel Kadett, and a Renault Clio. He became one of the top drivers while driving Renault Megane Maxi. In this car he also won his first Polish Rally Championship title in 1997. After 2 seasons with Renault, he signed a contract with Marlboro Mobil 1 team. He changed his car to a Ford Escort WRC and in following years to a Ford Focus WRC. Those years were most successful for Kulig. He won another 2 Polish Championship titles and became well known in European and World rally. Kulig spent the 2002 and 2003 seasons competing in the European Rally Championship (2nd place in 2002) and occasional WRC events. In 2002 Janusz Kulig won the Rally du Valais. His biggest success in WRC was 1st place in PCWRC in Sweden 2003 but after the rally he was stripped of his glory by FIA due to illegal modifications in his Mitsubishi Lancer EVO VII (the flywheel had different streak than the one approved by FIA). For the 2004 Polish Championship Season he signed a contract to drive Fiat Punto S1600. Kulig died in an accident after his car (Fiat Stilo) collided with a train on a level crossing.

Domitius Calvinus came from a noble family and was elected consul for 53 BC, despite a notorious electoral scandal. He was on Caesar‚Äôs side during the Civil War with Pompey. At the decisive battle of Pharsalus he commanded the center of Caesar‚Äôs army. After the battle he became governor of Asia. He tried to oppose the invasion of Pharnaces, the king of Bosphorus, who had taken the occasion of the Roman civil war to invade the province of Pontus; however he suffered a crushing defeat at the battle of Nicopolis in Armenia (December of 48 BC). Direct intervention by Caesar brought a quick end to the conflict, and Pharnaces' army was annihilated at Zela in 47 BC. Despite this failure, he remained a trusted friend of Caesar. Domitius Calvinus's activities immediately after the death of Caesar are unknown, but in 43 BC he was a strong supporter of Octavianus and participated in the civil war against Brutus and Cassius. During the Philippi campaign in 42 BC, he had to bring reinforcements from Italia to Greece for Mark Antony and Octavianus' army, however his fleet was destroyed by the enemy in the Ionian Sea with the loss of two legions. Despite this defeat he was awarded the honor of a second consulship in 40 BC and was sent by Octavianus as governor to Hispania, where he remained for three years (39 BC-36 BC). Apparently, his military activities in Spain were successful, since he was saluted as imperator by his troops and on his return he was awarded a triumph. He also rebuilt the Regia in the Roman Forum. Although we do not have many facts concerning his further political activities, an inscription shows that in 20 BC he was still alive and a member of the important Arval Brethren priesthood, reserved only for members of the nascent Imperial family and to the emperor's most distinguished supporters. Although Domitius Calvinus' career does not show any particular ability, either in politics (he obtained his first consulship only after scandalous bribery) or in war (he suffered two major defeats), he maintained an important political role. This was most probably because he was one of the very few Roman nobles to support the Caesar/Octavianus party from the very beginning. References Matthias Gelzer. Caesar: Politician and Statesman.

Early life  James Paine was probably baptised 9 October 1717 at Andover, Hampshire, the youngest of the five children of John Paine (d. 1727), carpenter, of Andover, and his wife, Jane Head (bap. 1684). Whilst facts about Paine's early life are sparse, it is thought that he studied at the St Martin's Lane Academy, London, founded by William Hogarth in 1735 to allow artists to practise life drawing. Here he came into contact with many innovative architects, artists designers, including architect Isaac Ware.  Career  It is thought that Ware introduced him to the third earl of Burlington and his circle of friends. Paine‚Äôs first professional job, aged only nineteen, was as the Clerk of Works supervising the building of Nostell Priory, Yorkshire (c.1737‚Äì1750), designed by Colonel James Moyser, a friend of Lord Burlington. Essentially a Palladian, Paine was to work on many other projects in the area including Heath House in the village of Heath in between Nostell Priory and Wakefield. Paine lived in Pontefract whilst working at Nostell Priory, and whilst working on that project, he was also commissioned to design the Mansion House at Doncaster, Yorkshire between 1745 and 1748. From the 1750s, he had his own practice, and designed many villas, usually consisting of a central building, often with a fine staircase, and two symmetrical wings. The most important house which he was involved with was Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire where he succeeded Matthew Brettingham from 1759 to 1760 and suggested the colonnaded hall, but he was himself displaced by Robert Adam, who altered his designs. At around the same time, he designed the very grand stables at Chatsworth House in the same county. He was a favourite architect of the powerful Catholic families of the time. In the 1760s he was commissioned to rebuild Worksop Manor for the Duke of Norfolk as well as the new Thorndon Hall (1764‚Äì70) in Essex for Lord Petre and his house on Park Lane, London. From 1770 to 1776, he built New Wardour Castle in Wiltshire (which featured as the Royal Ballet School in the film Billy Elliot). Paine held various posts, some sinecures, in the Office of Works culminating in appointment as one of the two Architects of the Works in 1780 but lost the post in a reorganisation in 1782. He was appointed High Sheriff of Surrey for 1783. His practice declined in his later years as he refused to participate in the Neoclassical fashions established by the Adam brothers. He published much of his own work in his two volumes of Plans, elevations and sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Houses (1767 and 1783). In 1789, Paine retired to France, where he died in the autumn.  Personal life  Paine married twice. His first wife was Sarah Jennings, daughter and coheir of George Jennings of Pontefract. They married in March 1741 and had a son, the architect, sculptor, and topographical watercolourist James Paine (1745‚Äì1829).'Paine, James', in Robert Gunnis, ed., Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660‚Äì1851 After Sarah's death, Paine married Charlotte Beaumont (1722‚Äì1766), youngest daughter of Richard Beaumont of Whitley Beaumont, near Huddersfield. They were married by June 1748 and had two daughters, Charlotte (1751 ‚Äì 31 October 1814) and Mary, known as 'Polly' (1753-1798). Charlotte married St John Charlton (April 1760 - 3 October 1802) on 22 December 1781 who later became High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1790 and the couple lived at Apley Castle. Mary married artist Tilly Kettle, with a dowry of ¬£5,000. In 1773 Paine bought the lease to Sayes Court, a country estate near Chertsey in Surrey. He became a justice of the peace for Middlesex in December 1776 and for Surrey in June 1777, and served as high sheriff of Surrey in 1785.  Portraits by Joshua Reynolds  Paine was a friend of artist Joshua Reynolds and had designed a large gallery and painting room, with an elaborate chimney piece, for Reynold‚Äôs home in Leicester Fields, now Leicester Square, London. In 1764, Reynolds painted a joint portrait of James Paine father and son pictured above (now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The following year Reynold painted a matching portrait of Charlotte and her two daughters, Charlotte and Mary \\"Polly\\", possibly in exchange for in exchange for some of Paine‚Äôs architectural work at his home. This portrait is now in Lady Lever Art Gallery, Liverpool. The portraits were intended to be hung so that the father and son faced mother and daughters. Reynolds‚Äôs appointment book records an entry for their sittings: > '17 July 1765 Mrs Pain , Miss Pain and Miss Polly Pain.' Then, on 25 July, > 'Mrs Paine etc.' on 2 August 'Miss Paine' sat alone, and 'Mrs Paine' sat > three days later. On 3 October the entry read: 'Mrs Paine & Co'. There were > further appointments on 27 September, 27 November and 2 December, for 'Dog.' The portrait Mrs James Paine, and Her Daughters Charlotte Paine, b.1751, Later Mrs St John Charlton and Mary 'Polly' Paine, 1753‚Äì1798, Later Mrs Tilly Kettle) was exhibited twice in Yorkshire in late nineteenth century, and copies were made. It was eventually acquired by the art dealer C.J Wertheimer but when it was shown at Burlington House in 1908, it was catalogued as Portraits of the Misses Paine, their mother Charlotte having been painted out to increase its sale value. William Hesketh Lever paid ¬£4520. 5s for in 1918. In 1935, the Lady Lever Art Gallery Trustees took the decision to remove the over painting and restored Mrs Paine to her rightful place.  Legacy  In 2017, the Friends of Doncaster Mansion House led on the James Paine Festival, celebrating his life and work on the 300th anniversary of his birth.

It is east of Stirling. Dollar was once a place of residence of Mary, Queen of Scots. Toponymy Possible interpretations are that Dollar is derived from Doilleir, an Irish and Scots Gaelic word meaning dark and gloomy, or from various words in Pictish: 'Dol' (field) + 'Ar' (arable) or Dol (valley) + Ar (high). Another derivation is from Dolar, ‚Äòhaugh place‚Äô (cf Welsh d√¥l ‚Äòmeadow‚Äô. This word was borrowed from British or Pictish into Scottish Gaelic as dail ‚Äòwater-meadow, haugh‚Äô). John Everett-Heath, in derives it as 'Place of the Water Meadow' from the Celtic d√¥l 'water meadow' and ar 'place'. A further theory, linked to Castle Campbell's alternative name of Castle Gloom, is that it stems from Scots-French \\"Doleur\\", meaning sadness. History Castle Campbell, Dollar, Scotland Old houses in Dollar 500-year- old Castle Campbell stands overlooking the town, sitting on a forward projection of rock on the south side of the Ochil Hills. The castle was the lowland seat of the Duke of Argyll, where Mary, Queen of Scots once stayed in the 16th century. The original town (of which parts still survive) stands on the sloping ground beneath the castle, in what is now the north-east section of the town. Buildings here are general stone built and two storeys high. The oldest buildings date from the mid-17th century and several 18th century buildings exist. Development spread to the west and south through the 19th century. The construction of Dollar Academy in the early 19th century, with its extensive grounds created a refocus westwards. Around 1840 the construction of a new road to Muckhart on lower ground south of the original route, created the current main east-west street. This quickly became the new \\"town centre\\" and the focus of shops and public activity. A map of Dollar from 1945 The town has two war memorials, one for each world war. In the grounds of the Academy a bronze figure with outstretched hands by George Henry Paulin faces westwards and commemorates the fallen of the First World War. This also has names added for Northern Ireland.Inscription on Dollar War Memorial The dead were largely from the Academy; two non-Academy deaths (the Archibald brothers) are indicated by the word \\"parish\\" against their names. The Second World War has a far more modest memorial, in the small public garden on the main road, where the road suddenly twists. Both memorials are by local sculptor George Henry Paulin. A small museum run by volunteers contains a collection of local items, and much information about the former Devon Valley Railway, which closed to passengers in 1964. The town is now largely a dormitory community for people who work in Stirling and further afield  e.g. Glasgow and Edinburgh. Location and transport It is one of the Hillfoots Villages, situated between the Ochil Hills range to the north and the River Devon to the south. Dollar is east of Stirling on the A91 road to St Andrews. The Devon Valley Railway linking Alloa and Kinross closed to passengers in 1964 and to freight in 1973. Economy Attempts were made to mine lead and copper in Dollar Glen from the 18th century and possibly earlier, but these were of no economic significance. Coal mining in the area began around the same time and, until 1973, supplied the Kincardine Power Station, and later, the Longannet Power Station with coal from the Upper Hirst seam. A tiny private non-NCB coal mine operated from the Harviestoun estate from the mid-1970s, partly filling the gap that the closed NCB left, whilst there was still local demand for coal. In common with the other Hillfoots Villages, the textiles industry played an important part in the town's development. The Harviestoun Brewery was established west of Dollar in 1985, before its move to Alva. Governance From 1891 to 1975 the town had its own council. It is now within Clackmannanshire council area. It forms part of the Clackmannanshire East ward which includes Clackmannan, Comely Bank, Dollar & Muckhart. In the 2017 local elections, residents of the ward elected three councillors - one each from the Scottish National Party, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party.

Wang Tao described the residents of Dollar as \\"honest, self-sufficient and hard- working\\" and that \\"public order is well maintained\\". * Dollar Academy was founded in 1818 with a bequest from a Dollar native, Captain John McNabb, who had allegedly made his fortune in the slave trade. Amongst the many notable pupils at the Academy are James Dewar, the inventor of the vacuum flask; the grandsons of Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia; the second Presiding Officer (Speaker) of the Scottish Parliament, George Reid; BBC Gaza correspondent Alan Johnston; and political journalist for The Scotsman, the News of the World and The Spectator magazines, Fraser Nelson. * Lavinia Malcolm, Provost of Dollar between 1913-1919, was both the first lady provost and first female town councilor in Scotland (see Dollar Town Council 1891‚Äì1975). * The painter J.

It is usually adorned with some kind of ornamental plate or badge on the front, metallic or otherwise, and often has a feather, plume (see hackle), or pompom attached at the top. Origins The word shako originated from the Hungarian name for the peak, which Hungarian border soldiers (Grenz Infanterie) added around 1790 to their previously visorless stovepipe-style hats. Originally these hats were part of the clothing commonly worn by sheperds, before being added to the uniform of the Hungarian hussar in the early 18th century.Alex. R. Cattley, The British infantry shako, in: Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol. 15, No. 60 (Winter, 1936), pp. 188-208 (p. 188) Other spellings include chako, czako, schako and tschako. From 1800 on, the shako became a common military headdress, worn by the majority of regiments in the armies of Europe and the Americas. Replacing in most instances the light bicorne, the shako was initially considered an improvement. Made of heavy felt and leather, it retained its shape and provided some protection for the soldier's skull, while its visor shaded his eyes.John R. Elting, page 445 \\"Swords Around A Throne - Napoleon's Grande Armee\\", The shako retained this pre-eminence until the mid-19th century, when spiked helmets began to appear in the army of Prussia, which influenced armies of the various German states, and the more practical kepi replaced it for all but parade wear in the French Army. The Imperial Russian Army substituted a spiked helmet for the shako in 1844‚Äì45 but returned to the latter headdress in 1855, before adopting a form of kepi in 1864.Boris Mollo, Uniforms of the Imperial Russian Army, Following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military fashions changed and cloth or leather helmets based on the German headdress began to supersede the shako in many armies. Although the mid-19th century shako was impressive in appearance and added to the height of the wearer, it was also heavy and by itself provided little protection against bad weather as most models were made of cloth or felt material over a leather body and peak. Many armies countered this by utilising specially designed oilskin covers to protect the shako and the wearer from heavy rain while on campaign. The shako provided little protection from enemy action as the most it could offer was in giving partial shielding of the skull from enemy cavalry sabres. George Anthony Legh Keck During the period of general peace that followed the Napoleonic Wars, the shako in European armies became a showy and impractical headdress that was best suited for the parade ground. As an example, the \\"Regency\\" officers' shako of the British Army of 1822 was in height and across at the crown, with ornamental gold cords and lace. Lieutenant Colonel George Anthony Legh Keck can be seen in a portrait from 1851 wearing a 'broad-topped' shako that was topped by a white plume and held in place by bronze chin scales.Morgan-Jones, G. (2008) \\"The Prince Albert's Own Yeomanry - Leicester Yeomanry\\" http://www.paoyeomanry.co.uk/LY3.htm The \\"Regency\\" shako was followed in the British Army by a succession of models ‚Äî\\"Bell-topped\\", \\"Albert\\", \\"French\\" and \\"Quilted\\" ‚Äî until the adoption of the Home Service helmet, in 1877. Variations Reenactment of British infantry of 1815, with line infantry wearing the Belgic shako, followed by light infantry wearing the earlier \\"stovepipe\\" style The \\"stovepipe\\" shako was a tall, cylindrical type with a brass badge attached to the front. The stovepipe was used by the infantry of the British Army from around 1799, and its use was continued until the end of the Peninsular War. From then on it was used only by the light infantry. In the US Army, a lower felt shako superseded the top hat style, bearskin crest surmounted \\"Round hat\\" in 1810.David Cole: Survey of U.S. Army. Uniforms, weapons and accoutrements, 2007, p. 5 The \\"Belgic\\" shako was a black felt shako with a raised front introduced in the Portuguese Marines in 1797 and then in the Portuguese Army in 1806, as the . It was later adopted by the British Army, officially replacing the stovepipe shako in 1812, but was not introduced completely until 1815 and became therefore known as the \\"Waterloo\\" shako. This cumbersome headgear was already discarded in 1816, in favour of the slightly bell topped \\"Regency\\" shako.Cattley p. 193 The Belgic shako was decorated with silver or gold lace for officers, according to regimental practice.Colonel Robert H. Rankin, page 21 \\"Military Headdress - a pictorial history of military headgear from 1660 to 1914\\", Ren√© Chartrand, page 45 \\"The Portuguese Army of the Napoleonic Wars (3)\\", In 1813 the US Army adopted a similar entirely leather made model,Edgar M. Howell, Donald E. Kloster: United States Army Headgear to 1854. Catalog of United States Army Uniforms in the Collections of the Smithsonian Institution, Vol.1, 1969, p. 15 ff. nicknamend by the soldiers as\\"Tombstone\\" cap, because of the extension of the top front that reminded on a grave marker.Cole p. 6 The kiwa (also kiver) was a style of shako introduced into the Imperial Russian Army in 1812; its distinguishing feature was the dished or concave top.Haythornthwaite, Philip (1987) The Russian Army of the Napoleonic Wars (1): Infantry 1799-1814 Osprey Publishing, (p. 23) This style of shako was worn by the Black Brunswickers alongside shakos of the Austrian pattern.Von Pivka, Otto (1985), Brunswick Troops, 1809-15, Osprey Publishing, (p. 47) The bell-top shako was a large and elaborate type which became popular in the 1820s and 1830s when there was little warfare between the major European powers and practicality on the battlefield became less important than appearance on the parade ground. It featured a crown that clearly flared outwards towards the top, giving a distinctive bell shape, and was often adorned with decorative cords and plumes. British troops were accoutered with the bell-top shako from 1829 to 1844.Kannik, Prebben (1968), Military Uniforms in Colour, Blandford Press, (p.206) US troops followed that example by adopting the \\"Yeoman\\" crown cap in 1813 for Artillery and rifle regiments, followed by the bell crown cap (with concave sides) from 1821.Howell, Kloster p. 19The US shakos changed again from 1832 to 1851, when a leather made \\"cap\\" for infantry and artillery was introduced, resembling the former \\"Yeoman\\" crown cap. Howell, Kloster p. 26Dragoons were issued with a cap model, whose crown was smaller than the cap's base. Howell, Kloster p. 31 All those models were dropped in between 1851 and 1854, in favour of a cloth made shako of smaller size and swung shape, similar to the British \\"Albert\\" shako.Howell, Kloster p. 59 The Albert shako was a British design introduced in 1844, which was intended to be more practical than previous models. It featured a lower crown that tapered inwards at the top, and a second peak at the back intended to protect the wearer's neck from the sun. It is named after Prince Albert who supposedly designed it. It was not popular, and during the Crimean War a round \\"undress cap\\" was often worn instead. It was eventually replaced by smaller, lighter versions.Kannik p. 212 In the British Army it was the so called French pattern shako (1855-1861)Cattley p. 200, the Quilted shako (1861-1869)Cattley p. 202 and a last shako model (1869-1878), as lower and more ornamented version intended to be worn on parades only. The last two shako models were made of dark blue cloth mounted on a cork basis.Cattley p. 200, p. 204f. The shako was finally superseded for most British regiments by the home service helmet in 1878.Kannik p. 232 In the US Army, the last shako model of 1872 (a cut-down version of the 1851-1854 pattern) was replaced by the spiked helmet in 1882. Edgar M. Howell: United States Army Headgear 1855-1902. Catalog of United States Army Uniforms in the Collections of the Smithsonian Institution, Vol.2, 1975, p. 35 p. 62 Cavalry and artillery had adopted the helmet already in 1872.Howell p. 41 For undress or campaign dress, forage capsHowell, Kloster p. 22 and felt hatsHowell p. 1 had replaced the shako style cap since 1825 respectively 1855. The Bengal Native Infantry of the British East India Company's army worn a version of the bell-top shako as described above, although lacking a vizor or peak. Frequently portrayed in contemporary illustrations as being worn by mutinous sepoys during the Great Indian Rebellion of 1857, this headdress was actually replaced by the Kilmarnock cap ten years before.W.Y. Carman, page 100 \\"Indian Army Uniforms: Infantry\\", Morgan-Grampian: London 1969 Final period of extensive wear In 1914, the shako was still being worn in France (by chasseurs √† cheval, infantry of the Republican Guard, chasseurs d'Afrique and hussars); in Imperial Germany (J√§gers, Landwehr and marines); in Austro-Hungary (full dress of non-Muslim line infantry James Lucas, page 162 \\"Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868-1914, and hussars in both full and field dress); in Russia (full dress of generals, staff officers, and infantry, engineers and artillery of the Imperial Guard). In Belgium the shako was official field dress for line infantry, chasseurs √† pied, engineers, transport/ambulance, administration, fortress artillery, and mounted chasseurs, although after the outbreak of war it was usually discarded in favour of the \\"undress\\" cap. In Denmark it remained part of the full dress of Guard Hussars; in Mexico (full dress of federal troops of all branches); in Portugal (military cadets); in Romania (full dress of artillery); in Italy (horse artillery and military academies); and in Spain (line infantry, cazadores, engineers, and artillery). The Highland Light Infantry and Scottish Rifles of the British Army retained small shakos for full dress and the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica states that there were plans to reintroduce the shako as parade dress for all English, Irish and Welsh line infantry regiments - a project that was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. The Swiss and Dutch armies wore shakos, even for field wear, until after 1916. The Japanese Army had worn the shako as a parade headdress until 1905, although a form of high-sided kepi had been the normal wear. During this final period of elaborate and colourful traditional uniforms, the shako varied widely from army to army in height, colour, trim and profile. Amongst the most distinctive of these were the high Napoleonic shako (kiver) worn by the Russian Imperial Guard and the low streamlined model (ros) of the Spanish Army. The Swiss version had black-leather peaks at both front and rear - a feature that also appeared in the shako-like headdress that was worn by British postmen between 1896 and 1910, and New Zealand policemen of the same period. Most German police forces adopted a version of the J√§ger shako, after World War I, which replaced the spiked leather helmet (Pickelhaube) that had become identified with the previous Imperial regime. This new headdress survived several political changes and was worn by the civilian police forces of the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and West Germany. It finally disappeared in the 1970s, when the various police forces of West Germany adopted a standardised green and light fawn uniform that included the high-fronted peaked cap that is still worn. Modern use French Republican Guard at the Bastille Day Military Parade Mounted Grenadier, guarding the Casa Rosada In Europe, the infantry of the French Republican Guard, cadets at Saint-Cyr, cadets at the Belgian Royal Military Academy, cadets at the Portuguese Col√©gio Militar and Pupilos do Ex√©rcito military schools, the Italian Horse Guards Corps, Horse Artillery and cadets at the Military Academy of Modena, the Danish Guard Hussar Regiment, and the Spanish Royal Guard and 1st King's Immemorial Infantry Regiment all have shakos as part of their respective ceremonial uniforms. Various Latin American armies, including those of Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay and Argentina, retain shakos for ceremonial guard or military academy uniforms. In Russia, the historic kiver has been reintroduced for wear by the Kremlin Guards for ceremonial occasions. In India the Madras Sappers & Miners of the Madras Engineer Group wear dark-blue visorless shakos as part of their ceremonial uniform. An Indonesian ceremonial unit as well as the cadet corps of the military academies of the Philippines and South Korea also use shakos. In the United States, shakos are still worn as full-dress headgear by cadets of West Point (where it is known colloquially as a tarbucket), Virginia Military Institute, The Citadel, Marion Military Institute, New York Military Academy, and Valley Forge Military Academy and College (in a modified form) with their Full Dress Grey uniforms. Many college and high-school marching bands feature shakos as part of their dress uniform. In the Canadian Forces, Les Voltigeurs de Qu√©bec are authorized to wear dark green shakos with full-dress uniforms.  Non-military use  In the US and the Philippines, shakos are frequently worn by civilian marching bands and drum corps. In the latter country, the cadets of some civilian institutions such as the Philippine National Police Academy, and some colleges and high schools, also use the shako, although peaked \\"service cap\\" styles have become more popular in recent years. Those shako styles still in use in marching bands are generally quite tall and have elaborate plumes. For example, at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, the kilted Irish Guard wear tall black fur shakos with bright yellow plumes, bringing their total height in uniform to almost tall. These shakos are typical of marching band drum majors, however the Irish Guard shako is unique in its size, color, and design. In drum corps and corps-style marching bands, the chin strap is rarely worn under the chin; instead, it is worn just under the lower lip, in the style of cadets at West Point. In Canada the shako is worn by volunteers in various historical forts wearing 19th-century period uniforms.

The song was written by vocalist Gregg Allman in 1967, well before the founding of the group. Two demo versions from those years exist, including a version cut by the 31st of February, a band that featured Butch Trucks, the Allman Brothers' later drummer. Allman sold the publishing rights later that year, but they were reacquired by manager Phil Walden in 1972. The song's title is frequently referred to incorrectly as \\"Sweet Melissa\\" due to the lyric being sung at the end of each of the first two choruses. The version on Eat a Peach was recorded in tribute to Duane Allman, who considered the song among his brother's best and a personal favorite. He died in a motorcycle accident six weeks before its most famous rendition was recorded. Background Gregg Allman penned the song in late 1967. He had previously struggled to create any songs with substance, and \\"Melissa\\" was among the first that survived after nearly 300 attempts to write a song he deemed good enough. Staying at the Evergreen Motel in Pensacola, Florida, he picked up Duane's guitar which was tuned to open E and immediately felt inspired by the natural tuning. Words came naturally, but he stumbled on the name of the love interest. The song's namesake was almost settled as Delilah before Melissa came to Allman at a grocery store where he was buying milk late one night, as he told the story in his memoir, My Cross to Bear: > It was my turn to get the coffee and juice for everyone, and I went to this > twenty-four-hour grocery store, one of the few in town. There were two > people at the cash registers, but only one other customer besides myself. > She was an older Spanish lady, wearing the colorful shawls, with her hair > all stacked up on her head. And she had what seemed to be her granddaughter > with her, who was at the age when kids discover they have legs that will > run. She was jumping and dancing; she looked like a little puppet. I went > around getting my stuff, and at one point she was the next aisle over, and I > heard her little feet run all the way down the aisle. And the woman said, > \\"No, wait, Melissa. Come back‚Äîdon‚Äôt run away, Melissa!\\" I went, \\"Sweet > Melissa.\\" I could've gone over there and kissed that woman. As a matter of > fact, we came down and met each other at the end of the aisle, and I looked > at her and said, \\"Thank you so much.\\" She probably went straight home and > said, \\"I met a crazy man at the fucking grocery.\\" Allman rushed home and incorporated the name into the partially completed song, later introducing it to his brother: \\"[I] played it for my brother and he said, 'It's pretty good‚Äîfor a love song. It ain't rock and roll that makes me move my ass.' He could be tough that way.\\" The duo produced a demo recording of \\"Melissa\\" that later surfaced on One More Try, a compilation of outtakes released thirty years later. In 1968, the duo recorded it during a demo session with the 31st of February, a band that featured Butch Trucks, the Allman Brothers' later drummer. That version is thought to have featured the debut recorded slide guitar performance from Duane Allman, and the entire session was later compiled into Duane & Greg Allman, released in 1972. Gregg Allman sold the publishing rights to \\"Melissa\\", as well \\"God Rest His Soul\\" (a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr.), to producer Steve Alaimo for $250 () shortly thereafter. He had been tied up in Los Angeles, contractually bound by Liberty Records (who had previously issued albums by the Allmans' first band, the Hour Glass), and used the money to buy an airplane ticket to fly back. When Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1971, his brother performed the song at his funeral, as he had grown to like the song over the years. Gregg Allman commented that it \\"didn‚Äôt sit right\\" that he used one of his brother's old guitars for the performance, but he nonetheless got through it; he called it \\"my brother‚Äôs favorite song that I ever wrote.\\" Both because he did not own the rights and found it \\"too soft\\" for the band's repertoire, he never mentioned the song to the members of the Allman Brothers Band. Following Duane's death, manager Phil Walden arranged to buy back the publishing rights in order to record the song for Eat a Peach, the band's fourth album. Gregg brought it to the studio the day following his birthday and the band recorded it that afternoon at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. They felt it lacked a compelling instrumental backing element so guitarist Dickey Betts created the song's lead guitar line. In popular culture \\"Melissa\\" has enjoyed renewed popularity in the 2000s due to its feature in a commercial for Cingular/AT&T; Wireless cell phone company and the use of it in a scene in Brokeback Mountain. It was prominently featured in the 2005 film House of D, performed by both the Allman Brothers and Erykah Badu.

Wines is founder and president of SITE,SITE, Environmental Design Official website a New York City -based architecture and environmental arts organization chartered in 1970. This multi-disciplinary practice focuses on the design of buildings, public spaces, environmental art works, landscape designs, master plans, interiors and product design.Site Environmental Design, Overview, 2012 The main focus of his design work is on green issues and the integration of buildings with their surrounding contexts. Wines is currently a professor of architecture at Penn State University. In addition to critical writing, he has lectured in fifty- two countries on green topics since 1969. In 1987, his book De-Architecture was released by Rizzoli International Publications. There have been twenty two monographic books museum catalogues have published his drawings, models and built works for SITE. In total, Wines has designed more than 150 projects for private and municipal clients in eleven countries. He has won twenty-five writing and design awards including the 1995 Chrysler Design Award. Wines explicitly expresses his own \\"concern for the Earth.\\" Having written at length on new modes of architecture, design, and planning: > The [20th] century began with architects being inspired by an emerging age > of industry and technology. Everybody wanted to believe a building could > somehow function like a combustion engine. As an inspirational force in > 1910, one can understand it.

Dir. ‚ÄúEcological Design: Inventing the Future‚Äù Ecological > Design Project, 1994  Background and career  James Wines graduated from Syracuse University in 1956. He became a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome that year and was bestowed a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1962. He began his career as a successful sculptor and graphic designer, exhibiting with the Otto Gerson Gallery (subsequently Marlborough Gallery) in New York. Professor Wines‚Äô corporate clients include Swatch, MCA Universal, MTV, Nickelodeon, Williwear, Isuzu, Disney, Costa Coffee, Carrabba's Restaurants, Saporiti Italia, Brinker International, Allsteel, Ranger Italia, Reliance Energy Corporation, and Denny's. Among municipal clients, he has worked for the cities of Hiroshima, Yokohama, Toyama, Seville, Vienna, Vancouver, Le Puy en Velay, Chattanooga, and New York City. His original drawings for these projects have graced the covers of dozens of international design magazines. As an educator, Wines originally held adjunct positions at the New School for Social Research (1963‚Äì65) and a number of other institutions. In 1974, he taught as an Associate Professor of Fine Art in the New York University Department of Art and Arts Professions. This was followed by visiting professorships at Dartmouth College, the University of Wisconsin, New Jersey School of Architecture, and Cooper Union Design Center. He was chair of the Environmental Design department at Parsons School of Design from 1984 to 1990. After teaching at Domus Academy in Italy and at the University of Oklahoma, he became a professor of architecture at Pennsylvania State University in 1999. Wines daughter Suzan is also an Architect and is co owner with fellow Architect Azin Valy of the award winning firm I-Beam Design. Both Suzan and Azin are graduates of Cooper Union. Philosophy on hand drawing Professor Wines strongly advocates hand drawing as a key to conceptual processes, alongside computer-aided tools ‚ÄúFor most architects graphic representation is notional, technical, or illustrative and mainly used as an analytical tool to record design intentions. I consider drawing more as a way of exploring the physical and psychological state of inclusion, suggesting that buildings can be fragmentary and ambiguous, as opposed to conventionally functional and determinate.‚Äù Selected works by James Wines & SITE Best Productssee also: Best Products * Grey Disc, the Governor Nelson A.

The Red River Bridge Company, a private firm owned by Benjamin Colbert, had been operating a toll bridge between Colbert, Oklahoma, and Denison, Texas, carrying U.S. Route 69 and U.S. Route 75. Texas and Oklahoma had jointly built a new, free span northwest of the existing toll bridge. On July 10, 1931, the Red River Bridge Company obtained an injunction against the Texas Highway Commission (now Texas Department of Transportation), keeping it from opening the new bridge. The company said that the highway commission had promised in July 1930 to buy the old toll bridge for $60,000 (equal to $ today). In reaction to the injunction, the Governor of Texas, Ross S. Sterling, ordered that the new free bridge be barricaded from the Texas end. On July 16, Oklahoma Governor \\"Alfalfa Bill\\" Murray ordered the new bridge open, by executive order. Murray issued this order on the grounds that the land on both sides of the river belonged to Oklahoma, per the Louisiana Purchase treaty of 1803. Murray sent highway crews across the new bridge to destroy the barricades. Governor Sterling sent Adjutant General William Warren Sterling and three Texas Rangers to the new bridge to defend the Texas Highway Commission workers enforcing the injunction, and rebuilt the barricade that night. The next day, Oklahoma crews under Governor Murray's order demolished the Oklahoma approach to the toll bridge, rendering that bridge impassable. The Texas State Legislature called a special session on July 23 to pass a bill allowing the Red River Bridge Company to sue the state over the issue, partially in response to meetings in Sherman and Denison, Texas, demanding the free bridge be opened. The next day, Governor Murray declared martial law at the site, enforced by Oklahoma National Guardsmen, and personally appeared at the site, armed with a revolver, hours before a Muskogee, Oklahoma, court issued an injunction prohibiting him from blocking the northern toll bridge approach. Murray directed the guardsmen to allow anyone to cross either bridge. Murray discovered on July 27 that the free bridge was in danger of being closed permanently. He expanded the martial-law zone across the river, stationing guardsmen on both free bridge approaches. The injunction against the bridge opening was dissolved and the martial law order rescinded on August 6. News of the dispute made national and international headlines. Adolf Hitler may have believed that the events were evidence of in-fighting between the American states, weakening the union. The free bridge that was the cause of the dispute was opened on Labor Day, September 7, 1931.http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/ok/bryan/history/bridge.txt It was replaced in 1995, though a portion of the bridge was saved as a historical attraction and relocated to a park in Colbert, Oklahoma.

Storks lack a pharynx and are mute. *Wood stork, Mycteria americana (C) Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black and white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens (A) Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are cormorant-like water birds with very long necks and long, straight beaks. They are fish eaters which often swim with only their neck above the water. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants and shags Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Cormorants are medium-to-large aquatic birds, usually with mainly dark plumage and areas of colored skin on the face.

Owned by Real and Smootha company formerly known as GMG Radiothe station was aimed at the over-40 demographic, and competed for its audience with BBC Radio 2. It was broadcast on the DAB Digital Radio Digital 1 national multiplex, Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media, online and on regional FM and DAB frequencies in the North West, London, North East, West Midlands, Scotland and East Midlands. Nationally the station attracted a weekly average audience of 3 million. The station opened in 1990 as 102.2 Jazz FM in London, and a second Jazz FM branded station was launched four years later in Manchester. The Manchester station became Smooth FM 100.4 in 2004, and was the first in the network of independent local radio stations to use the Smooth brand. The London station followed suit a year later. The network's parent company, GMG Radioa subsidiary of the Guardian Media Groupacquired the Saga Radio Group in the mid-2000s, and all Saga stations were given the Smooth name. After the publication of John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio, and the passing of the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and broadcasts, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into a single, quasi-national station in October 2010; local news feeds were produced at GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland produced its own breakfast and drivetime shows, but carried networked programming at other times. As part of their licence agreement, the London and Manchester stations were required to continue their commitment to jazz music after dropping the Jazz FM name, and the UK's broadcasting industry regulator Office of Communications (Ofcom) stipulated they must broadcast 45 hours of jazz programming per week, but this requirement was ended shortly before the merger took place. Smooth recruited many well-known British radio personalities to its line-up. Presenters on the network included Emma B, Simon Bates, Tony Blackburn, Mark Goodier, David Jensen and Chris Tarrant. The station's flagship breakfast show was presented by Simon Bates, who left Classic FM after more than a decade. It broadcast occasional documentaries on subjects relating to music, news and media events; some of these won the station radio industry awards. In November 2011 Smooth launched a second station on the Digital One platform dedicated to Christmas music, and later replaced this with \\"Smooth 70s\\", which played music from the 1970s. The Christmas station returned in 2012, and Smooth 70s closed in September 2013. Along with its sister station, Real Radio, Smooth was an official host of the Blackpool Illuminations switch-on ceremony from 2010, and staged regular, free live music events. The station signed a number of sponsorship deals with companies such as Tetley Tea and ATS Euromaster, and held annual fundraising events in aid of the charities Help for Heroes and Macmillan Cancer Support. GMG Radio was taken over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's purchase of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large as a result of the deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth. Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014. History =Early years as Jazz FM= London's Royal Albert Hall was the venue for Jazz FM's launch night which featured a performance by Ella Fitzgerald. London station 102.2 Jazz FM was launched on 4 March 1990 with a concert performed by Ella Fitzgerald at the Royal Albert Hall. Jazz FM played mainly soul and jazz music and was broadcast to the London area. A sister station in Manchester called 100.4 Jazz FM was launched on 1 September 1994. The Jazz FM stations were purchased by the Guardian Media Group in 2002, and became part of the company's radio division, GMG Radio Holdings Ltd. In 2003, GMG radio conducted market research into the type of music that listeners in the north-west of England wanted to hear on the radio. The study concluded that many people were dissuaded by the name Jazz, and as a result, 100.4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as Smooth FM on 1 March. In 2005, GMG rebranded the London station 102.2 Smooth FM. The two renamed stations played middle of the road music, soul and R&B; during the day and as part of their licence requirements, jazz music at night. On 20 October 2006, GMG Radio announced that it was requesting a change of format for 102.2 and 100.4 Smooth FM from Ofcom, to remove the stations' daytime soul and R&B; licence commitments. GMG Radio proposed an easy listening music service mixed with speech for the over 50s, and an improved local news service. Ofcom approved the changes on 8 December 2006, with the condition that GMG retained the 45 hours of jazz per week that constituted part of the former licence requirement. As a result of the format change and to distance the station from its London rivals Magic and Heart 106.2, GMG Radio agreed that a minimum of 20% of its daytime music output would be over 40 years old. = Change of identity and expansion = The former studios of 97.5 Smooth Radio in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, seen here in January 2008 shortly after it went on air. The station was broadcast to the north-east of England. In December 2006, GMG Radio acquired the Saga Radio Group, which owned stations in the West Midlands, East Midlands and Scotland, and a licence to begin broadcasting to the North East, and expanded the Smooth Network. Along with the Smooth FM stations in London and Manchester, all Saga stations were relaunched under the Smooth Radio brand on 26 March 2007. Saga 105.7 FM in the West Midlands became 105.7 Smooth Radio, Saga 106.6 FM in the East Midlands became 106.6 Smooth Radio and Glasgow based Saga 105.2 FM became 105.2 Smooth Radio. A service for the north-east of England, 97.5 Smooth Radio, was launched in January 2008. To begin with, most programming for these stations was produced locally and some shows were networked from London. However, Smooth gradually increased its networked programming until most content was originated in London or Manchester. In March 2008, GMG Radio requested that Ofcom remove the 45-hour jazz commitment for its London and Manchester stations. The company planned to relaunch Jazz FM from the jazzfm.com service which broadcast on DAB in Glasgow, online and on a DAB multiplex in London. In a meeting on 22 April 2008, Ofcom declined the request. GMG relaunched Jazz FM despite having to retain the jazz commitment. The decrease of local output lead to criticism from Norman Quirk, the former managing director of Saga 105.2 FM in Glasgow, after GMG Radio dismissed six Scottish presenters in August 2008 in favour of increased networked content from its stations in London and Manchester. The station had operated a 24-hour schedule of local programming. Quirk labelled the dismissals \\"disgraceful\\" and expressed his fears that the station would not be able to serve the needs and interests of the Scottish people as well as Saga had done. =Further expansion= After John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that it wanted to compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. Regional content would be kept; split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast the rest of the time. The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended. The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays, and other programming coming from London. On 1 November 2011, GMG Radio launched \\"Smooth Christmas\\" on the Digital One multiplex, a dedicated station playing only Christmas music with no news or advertisements. It promoted Smooth Radio and broadcast until 27 December 2011. Smooth Christmas was replaced on a trial basis by Smooth 70s, playing tracks from the 1970s. The station was warmly received by listeners, and in January 2012 GMG Radio confirmed a deal with US syndication firm Premiere Networks to air 1970s editions of the American Top 40 show presented by Casey Kasem, which would be broadcast at weekends. Smooth 70s' weekday programming included Disco Lunch and Late Night Love Songs. Due to its popularity, Smooth Christmas was relaunched in November 2012 on the Digital One multiplex alongside Smooth 70s. =New ownership= In June 2012 it was reported that Guardian Media Group was seeking to sell GMG Radio in order to restructure itself to stem losses being made by The Guardian and The Observer newspapers. Several offers were received for the subsidiary, valuing it at ¬£50 million. GMG Radio was sold to Global Radio on 25 June, at an estimated price of between ¬£50 million and ¬£70 million. Global renamed GMG Radio \\"Real and Smooth Radio Ltd.\\" Several rival radio groups expressed their concerns over the takeover and the effect it could have on commercial radio in the UK. The deal prompted speculation about the possible disappearance of the Smooth Radio brand as a result of a possible merger with Global's Gold network, which was aimed at a similar audience. It was announced that in the short term GMG Radio and Global would continue to operate as separate entities while a review of the sale was carried out by Ofcom. On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt instructed Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to examine Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market because of concerns the takeover may not be in the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013. On 21 February 2013, the Competition Commission confirmed it would delay its decision until May, and issued a statement in which it said, \\"The range of possible remedies to be considered in this case is complex and that all possible remedies need to be explored with the parties to the merger and third parties\\". The Commission published its final report into the acquisition on 21 May, requiring Global to sell radio stations in seven locations. On 14 June, it was reported that Global would appeal against the Commission's decision. A date for the appeal was subsequently scheduled for October. Following the hearing, in November, the Competition Appeal Tribunal rejected Global's appeal, meaning it would have to sell some stations in order to complete the takeover. Global announced in December that it would not appeal the decision, and would instead begin the process of selling the assets as directed by the Commission. Global announced on 12 August 2013 that Real and Smooth would relocate their London and West Midlands offices to Global premises. Smooth Radio's output was relocated to Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October, a move that coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global Radio permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and to replace it with a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London. Smooth would also take over Gold's medium wave frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched from 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting with Smooth Radio London. This also coincided with the return of local programming at breakfast and drivetime. Audience and ratings Smooth Radio catered mainly for listeners over the age of 40, a similar audience to that of BBC Radio 2. Official quarterly audience figures collated by Radio Joint Authority Research Limited (RAJAR) show that the station had an average weekly audience of just over 3 million listeners. Figures for the third quarter of 2010, released in October 2010 showed that collectively, the six regional Smooth stations had a weekly audience of 3 million at the time Smooth became a national broadcaster. John Simons, Group Programme Director for GMG Radio said, \\"The scope for Smooth Radio is huge and we're looking forward to seeing this growth continue as more and more people discover the station across the UK. We firmly believe Smooth has the potential to become the UK's biggest national commercial station and these figures show it's heading in the right direction!\\" During the final quarter of 2010the station's first as a national broadcasterlistening figures rose to 3.08 million, which remained unchanged in the first quarter of 2011, although listenership in London increased by 29%, largely because of the arrival of Simon Bates on the breakfast show in January 2011. Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning that for the first time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, Talksport. The station had an audience of 3.3 million in the final quarter of 2011, making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK. 3,317,000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012, which dropped slightly in the second quarter to 3.2 million. The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth-branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year. The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3.6 million, which fell to 3.1 million for the second quarter. However, figures rose again through the second half of the year, with 3.26 million in the third quarter of 2013, and 3.38 million in the fourth. Marketing and sponsorship When Smooth Radio launched as a national network, GMG launched a hoarding and television advertising campaign featuring eight \\"Smooth Ambassadors\\"listeners chosen to represent the station's \\"zest for life\\". Each advertisement included a piece of information about one of the ambassadors, and something they were currently doing. The campaign ran throughout October and November 2010. A later campaign featured Simon Bates, whose breakfast show attracted increased listening figures in London in early 2011. The station signed a number of sponsorship deals with advertisers, often for a particular show or for competitions associated with the advertiser. Its first major sponsorship deal was with Honda, which sponsored the drivetime show upon the station's launch. In July 2011 GMG signed a 13-week deal with gaming website Foxy Bingo to sponsor Smooth Radio's afternoon show, and a three-month deal with ATS Euromaster to sponsor the drivetime show began in September 2012. Real and Smooth announced a three-month deal with Sky Movies to sponsor Smooth's weekend film show, Smooth Radio at the Movies from February 2013. As part of a three-month deal with Tetley Tea announced in October 2011, Smooth Radio's logo appeared on Tetley products sold in British supermarkets. In August 2011, GMG announced a deal with the magazine publisher IPC whereby Smooth Radio would sponsor the TV Times Awards. A trip to Kenya was given away in association with the Kenya Tourist Board in the lead up to the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton; the winners would stay at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where the royal couple became engaged. High Street retailer Boots UK launched The Feel Good Forum, a health and beauty lifestyle programme that began airing for an eight-week run on Real and Smooth from March 2013. The show, presented by Kate Thornton was a collaboration between the broadcaster, Boots and other partners, including the Mumsnet website. Some online content was also produced to supplement the programme. In July 2013, Real and Smooth secured a deal with the organisers of the 2014 Commonwealth Games to be the Official Media Partner for its Ticketing Campaign. Presenters and shows =Presenters= Presenters on the station include many notable British radio personalities. The breakfast show was hosted by Simon Bates, who joined the network in January 2011. Bates revived The Golden Hour and Our Tune, two popular features from his Radio 1 days. Emma B presented a Sunday afternoon show from March 2011.

He left the station in October 2010 to present Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2 because the BBC would not allow him to continue working for a rival broadcaster. Andy Peebles was also a presenter with the station, having hosted his Andy Peebles Soul Train from 2004 to 2013, before moving the programme to Gold, another station owned by Global Radio. David \\"Kid\\" Jensen was a weekday presenter from April 2011 to December 2013. =Special programming and events= Stanley, capital of the Falkland Islands, seen here in 2005. In 2012, Simon Bates broadcast a week of programmes from the Islands to mark the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War. In September 2011, Simon Bates presented a week of programmes from South Australia as part of a promotion in which the station gave away a holiday to the state. In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there to their friends and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the Afghan National Army. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two-hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, with Smooth, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones. On 27 May 2012, Bates presented a special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, previewing Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the end of the 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast the breakfast show from the Falkland Islands for a week; he explored the lives and experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict. From 2010, Smooth and Real Radio were the official broadcaster of the switch-on ceremony for the Blackpool Illuminations, the broadcast rights to which it won from BBC Radio 2, which had aired it since 1997. 2010 was the first time the event was broadcast on commercial radio. The annual event was compered by presenters from the two stations at a purposely- built arena, and featured a music concert by popular artists. Performers in 2010 included Alesha Dixon, Gabriella Cilmi, The Wanted, Olly Murs, and Robbie Williams, who switched on the lights that year. The 2012 switch-on was performed by Greg Rutherford, Luke Campbell and Beth TweddleBritish Olympians who won gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Smooth Radio hosted a series of free live music gigs titled Love Live Music held at venues around the UK. Featured artists included Adele, Beverley Knight, Eliza Doolittle, Katie Melua, Will Young, Nell Bryden, Honey Ryder, Paul Carrack, The Pierces, Roachford, Jack Savoretti and Leddra Chapman. On 4 October 2011 the station celebrated its first anniversary as a national broadcaster with a concert at London's Cafe de Paris. An evening of music and entertainment was held at Liverpool's Waterfront on 21 July 2012, which was attended by 20,000 people. A similar event was held in June 2013. Paul Carrick played at an event at Nottingham's Glee Club on 26 September 2012. In December 2012 Real and Smooth secured exclusive broadcast rights to the \\"Christmas Hit Factory Live\\" concert, a show featuring artists and groups who achieved success with the Stock Aitken and Waterman and PWL record labels. Those appearing at the concert on 21 December included Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Dead or Alive and Pat and Mick. It aired on New Year's Eve. =Charity fundraising= From 2009 GMG Radio stations, including Smooth Radio, held an annual fundraising day for Help for Heroes, a UK charity which provides help and support to injured British service personnel. The first \\"Help for Heroes Day\\" took place on 10 November 2009, and collectively the stations raised ¬£200,000. The 18-hour special featured Ronan Keating, Simon Cowell, Spandau Ballet and The Soldiers, and Chris Tarrant returned to the network for the event. The second \\"Help for Heroes Day\\" in 2010 raised ¬£350,000, bringing the accumulated total to ¬£750,000. ¬£255,000 was raised for the charity in 2012. During the fundraising event \\"Smooth Radio Starlight Supper\\", listeners were encouraged to hold dinner parties at which guests donated money to a cancer charity. The event began in 2010 when the six stations in the Smooth network raised money for Breast Cancer Care in London, Macmillan Cancer Support in the North West, North East and West Midlands, the Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People in the East Midlands and Marie Curie's Big Build in Glasgow. The 2011, 2012 and 2013 events raised money exclusively for Macmillan Cancer Support. =Documentaries= Smooth Radio occasionally broadcast documentaries about music and historic events, usually at weekends. Its first series of documentaries, broadcast in 2008, included a six-part series about music from America's Mississippi River region, titled Rolling River of Rock. A second series broadcast the following year included Live Fast Die Young about famous musicians who died before the age of 30, Legendary Labels about major record labels and From Cleethorpes to California about record producer Rod Temperton. The station's documentaries won a bronze award in the Programmes and Series Promotion category at the 2009 New York Festivals International Radio Program Awards. In December 2010, the station celebrated the 50th anniversary of the television soap opera Coronation Street with a documentary titled Coronation Street at 50 and the station's Fallen Heroes won a Gold at the 2011 New York Festivals International Radio Awards. In March 2011 GMG Radio reporter Katie Collins travelled to Norway to interview Prince Harry as he prepared to join a group of injured ex-servicemen on a walk to the North Pole in aid of the charity Walking with the Wounded. The station also covered the walk; Collins was the only commercial radio journalist to interview the Prince on that occasion. The documentary won a Gold award for Best Documentary at the 2012 Sony Radio Academy Awards. On the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States, Smooth aired a documentary featuring British people who were living in New York City at the time of the attacks. This was followed by live coverage of the remembrance service from Ground Zero, the former site of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the attacks. In November 2012, Smooth confirmed it would air a documentary celebrating the life of Dusty Springfield over the Christmas period to mark the upcoming 50th anniversary of her debut as a solo artist. In January 2013, a Saturday programme dedicated to films and a regular documentary slot for Sunday afternoons were announced as part of an overhaul of the station's schedule. Mark Goodier returned to the network in June 2013 to present Rolling Home: The Summer of the Stonesa one- hour documentary about The Rolling Stones.

The culture of Nigeria is shaped by Nigeria's multiple ethnic groups. The country has 527 languages, seven of them are extinct. Nigeria also has over 1150 dialects and ethnic groups. The six largest ethnic groups are the Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Igbo in the southeast, and the Yoruba predominate in the southwest, the Tiv people of North Central Nigeria and the Efik - Ibibio. The Edo people are most frequent in the region between Yorubaland and Igboland. Many of the Edo tend to be Christian. This group is followed by the Ibibio/Annang/Efik people of the coastal south southern Nigeria and the Ijaw of the Niger Delta. Nigeria's other ethnic groups, sometimes called 'minorities', are found throughout the country but especially in the north and the middle belt. The traditionally nomadic Fulani can be found all over West and Central Africa. The Fulani and the Hausa are predominantly Muslim while the Igbo are predominantly Christian and so are the Efik, Ibibio, and Annang people. The Yoruba are equally likely to be either Christian or Muslim. Indigenous religious practices remain important to all of Nigeria's ethnic groups, and frequently these beliefs are blended with Christian beliefs, a practice known as syncretism. Major Nigerian Ethnic Cultures Language distribution around 1979. Hausa (in yellow) and other Chadic languages. Area of Yorubas. Igbo in the Southeast. Edo in the South. Ijaw (Ijo). =Efik-Ibibio Culture= The Efik-Ibibio culture of coastal southeastern Nigeria has made a significant contribution to the culture of Nigeria, especially the culture of the southern region. A brief summary is as follows: : Efik-Ibibio language: This language is spoken in Akwa Ibom State and Cross River State. It has various dialects such as the Annang dialect, Oron dialect, and many others. The Efik-Ibibio language has a significant influence on the languages and names of the people of southern Nigeria. : Protectors: The Efik-Ibibio culture was protected by a secret society, the Ekpe, that was indigenous to southeastern Nigeria. The \\"Ekpe\\", meaning 'Leopard', became a popular symbol in the Efik-Ibibio culture which later became popular in other Nigerian ethnic cultures. : Writing: Nsibidi is the popular ancient indigenous writing of the Efik people was invented by the Ekpe of the Efik-Ibibio people. : Food: Located in the coastal southeastern Nigeria by the Atlantic Ocean, the Efik-Ibibio people are blessed with various edible vegetables. Their food is popular throughout the entire Nigeria including the popular Afa√±g soup, Edikang Ikong soup, pepper soup, Ukwoho, Atama, Erita√±, jollof-rice, etc., etc. =Bini= Eghosa the queen of Bini =Yoruba Culture= The Yorubas are located on the western region of Nigeria and their leadership is monarchial in nature. They have kings who are allowed to take as many wives as they want and chiefs and titled individuals. They also practice traditional worship, paying homage to gods like Sango; the god of thunder, Oya, Ogun; the god of iron...etc. The Yoruba people are very friendly and welcoming to people of other tribes and nationalities. =Igbo Culture= The eastern part of Nigeria is the home of the Igbos, who are mostly Christians. Their traditional religion is known as Omenani. Socially they are led by monarchs known as Eze Igwes. These figures in turn are expected to confer subordinate titles upon men and woman that are highly accomplished. This is known as the Nze na Ozo title system. People of title are usually well-spoken, highly respected and well recognized in their communities. =Hausa-Fulani Culture= The Hausa-Fulani live in Northern Nigeria. Nigeria Consist of my Tribe and many Cultures, Hausa Fulani are the largest or is the most popular tribe in Nigeria, even though the Hausa and Fulani are different tribes but they are considered as one tribe due to the close relationship that exist between the two tribes. Hausa In Hausa land the their one culture that is always practice yearly by Hausa people known as Hawan Sallah. Nigerian literature Nigeria is famous for its English language literature. Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, is an important book in African literature.Booker, p. xvii. With over eight million copies sold worldwide, it has been translated into 50 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time.Yousaf, p. 34.Ogbaa, p. 5. Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka described the work as \\"the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him.\\" Nigeria has other notable writers of English language literature. These include Femi Osofisan who first published a novel Kolera Kolej was in 1975; Ben Okri whose first work, The Famished Road was published in 1991 and Buchi Emecheta who wrote stories drawn from her personal experiences of gender inequity that promote viewing women through a single prism of the ability to marry and have children. Helon Habila, Sefi Atta , Flora Nwapa, Iquo DianaAbasi Eke, Zaynab Alkali and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie among others are notable Nigerian authors whose works are read widely within and outside the country. Apart from the speakers of standard English, a large portion of the population, roughly a third, speaks Nigerian pidgin, which has a primarily English lexicon. It has become a common lingua franca as a result. Pidgin English is a creolized form of the language. For instance, \\"How you dey\\" means \\"How are you\\". The Palm Wine Drinkard, a popular novel by Amos Tutuola, was written in it. Nollywood Since the 1990s the Nigerian movie industry, sometimes called \\"Nollywood\\", has emerged as a fast-growing cultural force all over Africa. Because of the movies, western influences such as music, casual dressing and methods of speaking are to be found all across Nigeria, even in the highly conservative north of the country. Media Sports Supporters of English football clubs like Manchester United, Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea often segregate beyond the traditional tribal and even religious divide to share their common cause in Premier League teams. The Nigerian national football team, nicknamed the \\"Super Eagles\\", is the national team of Nigeria, run by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). According to the FIFA World Rankings, Nigeria ranks 31st and holds the second-highest place among the African nations behind Senegal (20th). The highest position Nigeria ever reached on the ranking was 5th, in April 1994. Food upright left Nigerian food offers a rich blend of traditionally African carbohydrates such as yam and cassava as well as the vegetable soups with which they are often served. Maize is another crop that is commonly grown in Nigeria. uos Praised by Nigerians for the strength it gives, garri is \\"the number one staple carbohydrate food item in Nigeria\\" a powdered cassava grain that can be readily eaten as a meal and is quite inexpensive. Yams are frequently fried either fried in oil or pounded to make a mashed potato-like yam pottage. Nigerian beans, quite different from green peas, are widely popular. Meat is also popular and Nigerian suya‚Äîa barbecue-like roasted meat‚Äîis a well-known delicacy. Bush meat, meat from wild game like antelope and giraffes, is also popular. Fermented palm products make a traditional liquor, palm wine, and also fermented cassava. Nigerian foods are spicy, mostly in the western and southern part of the country, even more so than in Indian cuisine. Some more examples of their traditional dishes are eba, pounded yam, iyan, fufu and soups like okra, ogbono and egusi. Fufu is so emblematic of Nigeria that it figures in Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, for example. Achebe's magnum opus is the most widely read book in modern African literature. Music upright The music of Nigeria includes many kinds of folk and popular music, some of which are known worldwide. The singer and social activist Fela Kuti was instrumental in Nigeria's musical development. Traditional musicians use a number of diverse instruments, such as Gongon drums. The kora and the kakaki are also important. Other traditional cultural expressions are found in the various masquerades of Nigeria, such as the Eyo masquerades, the Ekpe and Ekpo Masquerades of the Efik/Ibibio/Annang/Igbo peoples of coastal southeastern Nigeria, and the Northern Edo Masquerades. The most popular Yoruba manifestations of this custom are the Gelede masquerades. Resources A very important source of information on modern Nigerian art is the Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art operated by the Pan-Atlantic University in Lagos. In addition, the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission, and Naija Invest Gateway, provide real time information on the Nigerian business culture. Clothing Women wear long flowing robes and headscarves made from local markets who dye and weave the fabric locally. Southern Nigerian women choose to wear western-style clothing. People in urban regions of Nigeria dress in western style, the youth mainly wearing jeans and T-shirts. Other Nigerian men and women typically wear a traditional style called Buba. For men the loose fitting shirt goes down to halfway down the thigh. For women, the loose fitting blouse goes down a little below the waist. Other clothing gear includes a gele, which is the woman's headgear. For men their traditional cap is called fila. Historically, Nigerian fashion incorporated many different types of fabrics. Cotton has been used for over 500 years for fabric-making in Nigeria. Silk (called tsamiya in Hausa, sanyan in Yoruba, akpa-obubu in Igbo, and sapar ubele in Edo) is also used. Perhaps the most popular fabric used in Nigerian fashion is Dutch wax print, produced in the Netherlands. The import market for this fabric is dominated by the Dutch company Vlisco, which has been selling its Dutch wax print fabric to Nigerians since the late 1800s, when the fabric was sold along the company's oceanic trading route to Indonesia. Since then, Nigerian and African patterns, color schemes, and motifs have been incorporated into Vlisco's designs to become a staple of the brand. Nigeria has over 250 ethnic groups https://photos.state.gov/libraries/nigeria/487468/pdfs/Nigeria%20overview%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf and as a result, a wide variety of traditional clothing styles. In the Yoruba tradition, women wear an iro (wrapper), buba (loose shirt) and gele (head- wrap). The men wear buba (long shirt), sokoto (baggy trousers), agbada (flowing robe with wide sleeves) and fila (a hat). In the Igbo tradition, the men's cultural attire is Isiagu (a patterned shirt), which is worn with trousers and the traditional Igbo men's hat called Okpu Agwu. The women wear a puffed sleeved blouse, two wrappers and a headwrap. Hausa men wear barbarigas or kaftans (long flowing gowns) with tall decorated hats. The women wear wrappers and shirts and cover their heads with hijabs (veils).

His sole surviving work is a chronicle of the Trapezuntine empire of Alexios I Komnenos and his successors. This chronicle not only provides a chronological framework for this medieval empire, it also contains much valuable material on the early history of the Ottoman Turks from a Byzantine perspective, however it was almost unknown until Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer discovered it in the nineteenth century among the manuscripts of the Biblioteca Marciana of Venice. \\"Owing to this drab but truthful chronicle,\\" writes the Russian Byzantist Alexander Alexandrovich Vasiliev, \\"it has become possible to a certain extent to restore the chronological sequence of the most important events in the history of Trebizond. This Chronicle covers the period from 1204 to 1426 and gives several names of emperors formerly unknown.\\"Vasiliev, \\"The Empire of Trebizond in History and Literature\\", Byzantion, 15 (1940-41), p. 333  Life  All that is known about Panaretos is what little he tells us in his chronicle. He was a protosebastos and protonotarios in the service of Alexios III Komnenos. Panaretos makes his first appearance in an entry for 1351 when he records that he went with the mother of the emperor Alexios III, Irene of Trebizond, to Limnia against the rebel Constantine Doranites.Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 16 What Panaretos' exact position was at this time is not certain, but his next appearance does not come until the Trapezuntine civil war was over when he records he went with the emperor Alexios III in a disastrous attack on Cheriana, which he himself barely escaped from with his life.Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 20 Thereafter, he alludes to himself by using the first person plural when recording events in the annals. But he does not refer to himself by name until his entry dated to April 1363: he was part of an embassy, which included the megas logothetes, George Scholaris, sent to Constantinople to negotiate a marriage between one of the daughters of Alexios and one of the sons of the emperor John V Palaiologos. Besides the emperor, this embassy also met with the emperor-monk John VI Kantakuzenos, the Venetian podest√†, and Leonardo Montaldo the capetan of Genoese Galata in that order.Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 32 We know that he had at least two sons, both of whom died in 1368 while Penaretos was away in Constantinople: Constantine who died from drowning at the age of fifteen, and Romanos who died from disease at the age of seventeen. Panaretos was obviously greatly affected by their deaths because it is the only personal event that he describes in his chronicle.Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 40  The Chronicle  His Chronicle is a very brief work of twenty printed pages, covering the history of the Empire of Trebizond from its foundation in 1204. In its surviving form, there are at least five entries at the end dated from 1395 to 1426 (or 1429) that experts attribute to one or more continuators; a gap of about 10 lines separating the last entry (which has the date \\"in the same year\\") may be evidence that the copyist was \\"faced with an erasure, or simply felt constrained to omit a passage which his court readership wished to suppress\\", but Anthony Bryer points out the scribe \\"made no attempt to cover up the fact.\\"Bryer, \\"'The faithless Kabazitai and Scholarioi'\\", in Maistor: Classical, Byzantine and Renaissance Studies for Robert Browning, Ann Moffatt editor Byzantina Australiensa, 5 (1984), p. 322 Bryer himself proposed that this gap had contained at least two entries referring to the assassination of Emperor Alexios IV Megas Komnenos.Bryer, \\"'The faithless Kabazitai and Scholarioi'\\", pp. 309-330 It is not known where Panaretos found information for his work; he makes no allusions to his sources in the body of his work. About half of the chronicle is devoted to the years between 1349 and 1390, which falls into his adult lifetime. Interviews with older contemporaries could provide material for the generation before his lifetime. Fallmerayer pointed to a passage in Bessarion's Encomium on Trebizond which states there was a frescoed hall in the imperial palace displaying portraits of all of the Grand Komnenoi with their families in chronological order with brief accounts of their reign. \\"This dynastic gallery with its inscriptions might have easily served Panaretos as a background for his brief pre-chronicle. He needed only to copy it.\\"Fallmerayer quoted and translated by Vasiliev, \\"Empire of Trebizond\\", p. 336. Panaretos provides chronological information on rulers up to Alexios III in two forms  dates when the ruler began and ended his or her reign, and the length of the reign  which do not always match, suggesting he drew on at least two written sources for this data. Panaretos differs from the tradition of Greek historians by not writing in a learned, Attic Greek, but in the Pontic Greek which was commonly used in the Trebizond of his time. Throughout the chronicle, Panaretos never refers to his countrymen as Greeks, as was the custom in Byzantium, but as Romaioi, or as Christians. Although the chronicle ends in 1426, scholarly consensus is that the last four entries were written by an anonymous contributor.As expressed by Vasiliev, \\"Empire of Trebizond\\", p. 333. The sole copy of this work is part of Marcianus graecus 608/coll. 306, one of six works contained in this manuscript. All of the works comprising this manuscript were written by the same group of scribes; the paper of this manuscript has watermarks indicating it was made between 1440 and 1450, which led Peter Schreiner to date this manuscript to that decade.Peter Schreiner, \\"Bemerkungen zur Handschrift der trapezuntinischen Chronik des Michael Panaretos in der Bibliotheca Marciana (Marc.gr.608/coll. 306)\\", in Mare et Litora: Essays Presented to Sergei Karpov for his 60th Birthday, edited by Rustam Shukurov (Moscow: Indrik, 2009), pp. 615f Although the manuscript had thought to have come to the Biblioteca Marciana from the private library of Bessarion, Schreiner's investigation shows it had been owned in the later 15th century (during Bessarion's lifetime) by Johannes Zacharias; at some point in the 18th century the manuscript came into the possession of Giambattisti Recanti, whose will bequeathed his private library to the Biblioteca 12 November 1734.Schreiner, \\"Bemerkungen\\", pp. 620-622 Although Panaretos' Chronicle was discovered by Fallmerayer, the editio princeps was the work of his colleague Gottlieb Tafel who published the Greek text in 1832 in an appendix to his edition of Eustathius of Thessalonica but without translation or commentary. Fallmerayer published an edition of the Greek text with a German translation and commentary in 1844. The first scholarly, critical text of the Chronicle was done by Spyrindon P. Lambros, a Greek scholar, in 1907. Another edition was published by Odysseus Lampsides in 1958.\\"Michael Panaretos: Concerning the Great Komnenoi\\", ŒÜœÅœá·ºîŒπŒøŒΩ Œ†œåŒΩœÑŒøŒΩ 22 (1958), pp. 5-128 (in Greek) The most recent edition, with an English translation, was by Scott Kennedy in 2019.\\"On the Emperors of Trebizond,\\" in Two Works on Trebizond, edited and translated by Scott Kennedy, Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library 52 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2019), pp. 1-57.

It is on the Midland main line from London St Pancras to the East Midlands and the terminus of the Marston Vale line from Bletchley through Bedford St Johns.  History  The original station was built by the Midland Railway in 1859 on its line to the Great Northern at Hitchin. It was on land known as \\"Freemen's Common\\" approximately south of the current station on Ashburnham Road. The London & North Western Railway (LNWR) also had a station on its line between Bletchley and Cambridge. The Midland crossed it on the level and there was a serious collision when an LNWR train passed a red signal. (Curiously, both drivers were named John Perkins). Following this accident, the Midland built a flyover in 1885.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books. The extension to St Pancras opened in 1868. The connection to Hitchin ceased public services during 1961, but the line north of Bedford to Wigston Junction is still officially referred to as the Leicester to Hitchin line.Jacobs, G., (Ed) (2005 2Rev) Railway Track Diagrams: Midlands and North West: Book 4 Chart 2,3 Bradford on Avon:TRACKmaps. At this time the station was substantially altered, with the replacement of a level crossing by the Queen's Park overbridge. In 1890 fast lines were added to the west to allow expresses to bypass the station. Serious damage occurred during World War II when a bomb destroyed the booking hall's glass ceiling. The current station was built to replace it and was opened by Sir Peter Parker (chairman of BR) on 9 October 1978. The station was moved about north; the slow lines were realigned to the west next to the 1890 fast lines, to which platforms were added. Although the intention was for what remained of the old awnings to be transferred to the Midland Railway at Butterley in Derbyshire it proved impossible to save them. Nothing remains of the original station buildings. Services over the Marston Vale line to/from were transferred here from the old LNWR St Johns station in May 1984. A new connection, which runs along the formation formerly used by the abandoned line to Hitchin (closed to passenger traffic from 1 January 1962 and completely three years later), was laid from the Marston Vale branch up to the main line to permit this. The original St Johns station closed on 14 May 1984 with a replacement halt on the new chord opening the same day.Station Name - Bedford St Johns Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 23 August 2016.

It replaced 102.2 Jazz FM on 7 June 2005 at 10 am, with the help of R&B; singer Lemar and the then breakfast show host Jon Scragg. The first track played, keeping with the name of the newly launched radio station was Sade Adu's \\"Smooth Operator\\", and was owned by the radio division of the Guardian Media Group, GMG Radio. Following disappointing audience figures, the station was closed on 23 March 2007 and relaunched as 102.2 Smooth Radio the following Monday, following a successful format change request to Ofcom to play music oriented at listeners aged 50 and above. 102.2 Smooth FM was available on DAB across London, Central Scotland, the North East of England, South Wales and the Severn Estuary, Yorkshire and the West Midlands, as well as on Freeview channel 718. Origins In 2005, the Guardian Media Group made the decision to drop the jazz name from the Jazz FM brand and relaunch the station as Smooth FM. The London version of Jazz FM closed on 27 May 2005 to prepare for the launch of Smooth FM on 7 June. On-Air 102.2 Smooth FM played middle of the road music, soul and R&B; during the day and, as part of its licence requirements, focused on jazz music at night. Smooth FM also played specialist jazz and soul shows at weekends, details of which are listed below. The station was launched on the premise of a 'clutter-free' listen, offering 40 minutes of non-stop music every hour without commercial interruptions, deliberately posed as a direct challenge to the 'might' of the BBC and a tactic aimed at increasing the total number of hours listeners stayed with the station. The 'Smooth 40'102.2 Smooth FM Challenges BBC For Audience . Published by GMG Radio on 24 May 2005. Accessed 26 March 2007. later became the '9-5 Smooth 40', with off-peak shows introducing more commercial breaks into their output, before the concept was dropped altogether in mid-2006. Weekday programming featured an 'all-request' feature entitled 'Smooth on Demand' at 2 pm and 7 pm, Monday to Friday, where listeners were invited to 'demand' their favourite song by calling a local-rate phone number. Smooth FM also ran a number of 'big money' promotions to entice listeners to trial the station - the 'Smooth ¬£10K Tripleplay' ran for several weeks in late 2005, giving ¬£10,000 to a listener for correctly identifying three consecutive songs in a particular order. Another large prize was awarded to Dawn Muggleton on 19 April 2006, however - who correctly identified the 'Smooth Secret Song' (Diana Ross' My Old Piano), winning ¬£118,454 at the end of a contest that had run for several months, which was, at that time, the biggest cash prize awarded on UK radio since 1999. The station also held exclusive live commentary rights for Chelsea FC soccer matches in London for the 2005/06 and 2006/07 seasons. Commentary was provided by Gary Taphouse and Kerry Dixon.

The group consisted of three members, Maki Fujii, Ken Morioka, and Ryoichi Endo, though they employed extra support members for live shows. While Soft Ballet weren't necessarily chart toppers, they had a strong cult following and were considered pioneers of modern electronic music in Japan in the 1990s. History =Formation and Alfa Records Years= Soft Ballet was officially formed in 1986 when Ken Morioka and Ryoichi Endo (who had already been working together in a band called Volaju) joined with Maki Fujii. Together as Soft Ballet, the trio's combination of light synthpop with hard European-style EBM attracted attention for being a unique presence on the then-current Japanese music scene. After releasing a handful of songs on indie labels, the group was signed to Alfa Records in 1989 and immediately released their debut album, Earth Born. The album proved to be a success and the band toured extensively for it, leading to a concert being filmed professionally and released to home video early the next year. In this time Ken and Maki assisted famed video game composer Yuzo Koshiro with his soundtrack for The Scheme. In 1990 the band released two albums; First came their sophomore album, Document, followed later by a \\"mini-album\\", 3 [drai]. This mini-album was intended as a showcase for each individual member, with Ken, Maki, and Ryoichi each composing and performing a song separately from the rest of the band. The three each came at it from completely different styles- Ken made a relaxing pop number, Maki made a hardcore industrial song, and Ryoichi (with Maki handling the arrangement) put together a slow, ponderous ballad- effectively showing the three completely different sides that the band mixes together to form a typical Soft Ballet song. 1991 saw the band taking a political stance with the release of one of their most successful albums of all time, ÊÑõ„Å®Âπ≥Âíå. The album took a hard anti-war stance (most explicitly against the Gulf War) and displayed this aggression by embracing the band's industrial and EBM influence more than any of their past work. ÊÑõ„Å®Âπ≥Âíå was Soft Ballet's first album to reach the Oricon Top 10, and this new level of success brought them to the attention of a bigger record company, Victor Entertainment. It was also named one of the top albums from 1989-1998 in a 2004 issue of the music magazine Band Yarouze. Though Soft Ballet left Alpha by the end of 1991, Alpha continued to capitalize off the band's success by releasing remix albums. These remix albums, Alter Ego in 1992 and Twist And Turn in 1993, were notable for featuring exclusively Western remixers, including big names such as Richard D. James (under his Polygon Window alias), 808 State, LFO, and Cabaret Voltaire among others. This was among the first times that a Japanese band had participated in such an international remix exchange, and these albums became the first Soft Ballet material that was circulated in the West. =XEO Invitation Years= Soft Ballet moved over to Victor Entertainment by 1992, signing to a newly created sublabel called XEO Invitation. Million Mirrors, Soft Ballet's 5th album, was XEO's first album release and once more they broke into the Top 10. Though some songs were circulated on XEO Invitation promotional samplers, no songs from Million Mirrors were released as singles in Japan. However, in a rare move, the band released \\"Threshold\\" as a 12-inch single in the United Kingdom, through Blue August Records. Soft Ballet released their first singles on XEO in 1993, \\"Engaging Universe\\" followed by \\"White Shaman\\", which proved to be some of their biggest hits and earning them guest performances on multiple TV shows. The following album, Incubate, showcased the most diverse collection of styles in the band's history. Incorporating alternative rock, jazz, EBM, and pure noise, the album could be said to contain both their most accessible as well as most abstract songs. Perhaps the extreme musical diversity was a sign of the band's growing inner turmoil, because the group took 1994 off in order for Maki and Ken to explore other musical endeavors. Maki teamed with Hisashi Imai of Buck-Tick, and a slew of British artists (including Raymond Watts, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Julianne Regan) to release an album as Schaft, while Ken traveled Europe to record a solo album. The trio regrouped in order to record for a new album and, in a first for the band, wrote most songs collaboratively. Up to this point, with the exception of one song off Million Mirrors, the band members had never co-written lyrics or co-composed music. However the material from these new sessions featured much collaboration, as well as members changing roles (Ryoichi composing music and Ken and Maki writing lyrics). Despite this new team dynamic, conflicts within the band- members continued and the group announced that they'd split up after the release of their new album and a final concert series. Form came out in 1995 and became the most successful album of their entire career. This was followed by a remix album, Forms: Remix For Ordinary People, which once more exclusively featured non-Japanese remixers and was released in collaboration with SSR Records. After playing a three night concert series in Tokyo, Soft Ballet disbanded on July 23, 1995. To close out their career, they released a self-titled compilation album (though it is sometimes listed under the name The Ultimate Best Of Soft Ballet). Though ostensibly a \\"Best Of\\" album, it actually consisted mostly of new material. Of the two-disc set's 22 songs, 15 were completely new recordings of old songs. =Activities During Break-Up= Ryoichi immediately moved on to his own band called The Ends (later renamed to just \\"Ends\\"), releasing a new album in 1996 and every year since then until the band's reunion. While Ends never reached the same heights as Soft Ballet, it is arguably the most successful post-Soft Ballet project of any of the members. Ken engaged in a number of musical activities. In addition to a solo career, he composed the soundtrack for the popular anime series Kaikan Phrase, began doing session and production work for artists such as Demon Kogure, Feel, Hikaru Kotobuki and Losalios, and engaged in one-off collaborations such as forming the group Suicide with Issay of Der Zibet for a Japan tribute album. Maki had the most sporadic output during the group's breakup period. While Ryoichi had one consistent band, and Ken had a constant stream of different projects, Maki mostly participated in one-off projects. His first act outside the band was to return to Alfa Records to release Maki Fujii Assembled, an album of remixes of songs he composed for Soft Ballet (though all song titles were changed to disguise the fact that they were Soft Ballet songs). In the following years he appeared as a guest collaborator on albums by Ryuichi Kawamura (of Luna Sea), Mari Hamada and Zilch, and produced the debut album of the band Epidemic. In 1999 he established the project She Shell, but only two singles were ever released before the project was seemingly abandoned. Notably, She Shell was among the first acts to ever do a remix for Ayumi Hamasaki. =Reunion Years= The group had considered reforming for some time, but Maki had been the last holdout. Finally in 2002, the trio came to an agreement and Soft Ballet officially reunited. They made their return to the stage at the 2002 Summer Sonic Festival, and began recording together for the first time since 1995. The resulting album, Symbiont (released on EastWest Japan), showcased an updated sound, taking advantage of the leaps in digital music technology that had occurred since they last worked together. The album was a moderate success, but the wave of popularity that the band was riding when they broke up had now passed. The band played a handful of live dates through the end of 2002 and toured again at the start of 2003, and released a new single, \\"Bright My Way\\". For reasons that aren't clear, the band left EastWest Japan in the middle of the year and their next single, \\"Smashing The Sun\\" was released through Warner Music Japan. In the final quarter of 2003, Soft Ballet released Menopause which (as of 2014) is their final album. True to its title, Menopause was a mature album coming at topics with an older perspective. Notably, its final track (which is also, to-date, the final new Soft Ballet song), \\"ÂúüÁ∏ã„Çä\\", is the only song in the band's entire catalogue with a fully Japanese title. After embarking on one final tour in December, Soft Ballet disbanded again on December 17, 2003. This final show was filmed by the crew, and later released to DVD in 2013. =Post- Breakup Releases= Thanks to the band's strong cult following, Soft Ballet continued to release work after their disbandment. In addition to a series of compilation albums issued around the time of the break-up, Soft Ballet began offering work through Sony Music Direct. Albums and videos were offered for pre-order and, if a certain number of orders were placed, the releases would be printed on demand in a limited edition. Media released through this system include a DVD box set of early Soft Ballet concert videos, remastered reissues of the band's first four albums initially released on Alfa Records, and a DVD of the band's final concert from 2003. Most notable may be Index‚ÄìSoft Ballet 1989‚Äì1995, a massive 11-disc set of almost all songs, live tracks, and remixes the band released from 1989 to 1995. All songs were remastered under Maki Fujii, and extensive liner notes were included. As a bonus, never-before- released studio recordings of special live arrangements were included on the final disc. This set is extremely rare and highly valued, and regularly goes for close to 100,000 JPY at auction. Post-Soft Ballet Works =Ryoichi Endo= When Soft Ballet broke up, Ryoichi immediately returned to his band, Ends. It seems he was influenced by his time working with Soft Ballet again, due to the new directs that Ends took from this point forward. While previous Ends material mainly had a hard rock/classic rock style, this post-Soft Ballet material was far more electronic in nature. 2004's The Counter made use of modern synthesizers and mixed sped-up drum breaks with modern sounding pop rock. 2005's Found took this new direction even further, with songs that could be described as outright techno. As of 2014, Found remains Ends' most recent studio album and the band last played live in 2010. As of 2014, Endo has seemingly left behind the music industry for the time being, in favor of doing commercial voice-over work. =Ken Morioka= After the dissolution of Soft Ballet, Ken Morioka returned to his myriad of projects. He returned to his solo work, self-releasing a steady stream of singles and albums (including two collaborative albums; One with Daijiro Nozawa and one with the band ZIZ) which continues until the present. On the side, Morioka returned to session work, writing and/or touring with Mell, Tomoyasu Hotei, Kaya, Buck-Tick, and more. He contributed to soundtracks, including the game Dream Club Zero, the movie \\"Ë®òÊÜ∂„ÅÆÈü≥Ê•ΩGb\\", and \\"Ghost In The Shell Tribute Album Ver 2.0.0\\". In 2009, Ken and Masayuki Deguchi (formerly of the band Grass Valley) formed a new band, Gentleman Take Polaroid, and released one album together. In 2013, Ken took part in two supergroups; the first was KA.F.KA led by Masami Tsuchiya, the second was a backing band for a posthumous performance by hide. In 2014, Ken announced that he and Maki Fujii would be uniting to form a new group called minus(-). minus(-) released two mini-albums through 2014 and 2015, D and G, before Morioka died of heart failure on June 3, 2016. =Maki Fujii= Maki Fujii continued to be sporadic in his output. He spent the first years following the end of Soft Ballet working on the solo projects of Atsushi Sakurai and Kirito, while simultaneously working on his new band, Suilen. Fujii worked with Kirito for years, but when Kirito joined a new band in 2007 and therefore ended his solo project, Fujii took this as the time to put focus on his own band. Suilen released their first mini-album Èü≥„É≤Â≠ï„É† in 2007 and released three more mini-albums between then and 2009. Suilen also contributed music to the Hellsing OVA series in 2009. In 2008, Suilen played a triple bill show with acid android and Hisashi Imai's band Lucy. As a special encore, Fujii and Imai reunited as Schaft with Yukihiro on drums for a performance of Schaft's song \\"The HEROINside\\". In 2010, Suilen embarked on their last tour to-date, and Fujii contributed to two acid android albums.

Beginning Mannes and Godowsky's experimentation with color photography began in 1917, after seeing the film Our Navy in Prizma Color, which was advertised as a color film. Because of the low quality the boys felt cheated and decided to do something about it. They designed a movie camera and projector each with three lenses covered by orange-red, green and blue-violet filters.US Patent 1,619,949 (filed June 28, 1920, issued March 8, 1927) page 1, lines 25-29 specifies this variant of the standard red, green and blue filter colors, which was also used by the then-current Autochrome process. However, the patent is mainly concerned with a two-color (red-orange and blue-green) implementation. They took multiple black-and-white exposures and projected them back through the filters. They patented this system, but it was not a commercially viable process. Personal life Godowsky studied violin at UCLA and became a soloist and first violinist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestras. He also enrolled at UCLA to study physics and chemistry. He performed jointly with his father, Leopold Godowsky, one of the great pianists of the early twentieth century, using a rare Cremonese violin by Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges√π, the 1734 \\"Prince Doria\\". Godowsky Jr married Frances Gershwin, sister of George and Ira Gershwin, who became a recognized painter and sculptor. Their son, Leopold Godowsky III, was also a concert pianist.The Music of Leopold Godowsky III. By 1922, Godowsky had given up his orchestral jobs in California and moved back to New York City where he and Mannes worked as musicians. They experimented with color photography during their spare time. Discovery While on his way to perform in Europe in late 1922, Mannes made the chance acquaintance of a senior partner in the investment firm of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. and described their progress with color photography. Some months later the firm sent one of their junior associates, Lewis L. Strauss to the Mannes apartment to view the color process. The final results were impressive enough for Kuhn Loeb to invest in the process. Development of color process With financial backing, Godowsky and Mannes built a dedicated laboratory and in 1924 took out additional patents on their work. In 1930 Eastman Kodak was so impressed with the results that they contracted them to move to Rochester and take advantage of Kodak's research facilities. By 1935, Godowsky and Mannes and the Kodak research staff had developed a marketable subtractive color film for home movies. Kodachrome film was coated with three layers of ordinary black-and-white silver halide gelatin emulsion, but each layer was made sensitive to only one-third of the spectrum of colors‚Äîin essence, to red, green or blue. Special processing chemistry and procedures caused complementary cyan, magenta or yellow dye images to be generated in these layers as the black-and-white silver images were developed. After they had served their purpose, the silver images were chemically removed, so that the completed chromogenic film consisted solely of the three layers of dye images suspended in gelatin. [This is only partially accurate. All three layers were sensitive to blue light. The topmost layer was coated onto a \\"Carey-Lea silver\\" \\"filter\\" layer, which was a blue-light absorbing layer. This prevented blue light from reaching the two lower layers. It transmitted both red light and green light. The layer closest to the support was sensitive to both blue and red light. That is where the red light information was recorded. The layer above it was sensitive to both green and blue light. The top-most layer recorded the blue light information.] Kodachrome 16mm movie film was released for sale in 1935, and in 1936 Kodachrome 35mm still and 8mm movie film were released. Technicolor Monopack, a 35mm version of Kodachrome Commercial (originally a specialized 16mm low- contrast camera film intended for principal photography and not for direct projection) later became the first single-strip three-color film suitable for professional applications (when combined with Technicolor's proprietary dye- transfer printing process) and Monopack was used on several complete productions (and numerous second units) until it was replaced by Eastmancolor negative film in the 1950s. Three-strip Technicolor was itself replaced by Eastmancolor negative in 1955. Godowsky was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal in 1940. Godowsky and Mannes were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2005.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on July 14, 1999. It is the first episode of a three- part story arc, often known as \\"The Meteor Shower Trilogy,‚Äù which tells three different stories all taking place on the same night. The other two episodes are \\"Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub\\" and \\"Jewbilee.‚Äù As such, it features only one of the four main characters, Eric Cartman. Plot On the night of a meteor shower, Liane goes to Mr. Mackey's party, leaving Cartman to be babysat by Stan's 12-year-old sister, Shelley, who is an aggressive bully. While babysitting, she invites her 22-year-old boyfriend, Skyler, over, who in turn invites the rest of his rock band to rehearse (despite Liane specifically telling her not to have anyone over). Cartman is in his room, playing Wild Wild West and dressed up as Will Smith's version of Jim West from Wild Wild West, but becomes upset with Shelley babysitting him and the boys practising (especially when the former gives him wedgies). Meanwhile, Mr. Kitty is in heat, much to Cartman's annoyance. Later, Skyler's bandmates leave in disgust after performing a song made by Shelley. In an effort to get her back, Cartman takes a picture of Shelley and Skyler about to kiss and tries to send it to his mother via Kitty, but Shelley finds the picture with the cat and removes it. Kitty decides to go out in search of a tom. After an unsuccessful attempt with an overweight tom, she winds up seducing a large group of cats, and invites them back to Cartman's house and cracks open catnip. Eric tries to tell his mother that Shelley is breaking Liane's rule about having boys over, but she doesn't believe that Shelley would do such a thing. Back at home, during the meteor shower, Skyler gets mad at Shelly because she will not \\"put out\\" because she is 12 years old. Cartman has taped everything and is about to get Shelley in trouble, but instead comes to pity her when Skyler, angry that Shelley will not \\"put out\\" for him, breaks up with her and leaves her crying hysterically. Cartman and Shelley decide to team up for revenge, and sneak into the woods near where Skyler lives. Cartman manages to entice Skyler out of his house with a taping of his Salma Hayek impersonation while Shelley sneaks in and destroys his prized guitar. They return home to find Kitty and many other cats engaged in a massive feline orgy. Skyler shows up, furious, but Cartman throws a box of catnip at Skyler, which attracts the clowder of cats, who attack and rape him. Mrs. Cartman returns home. Shelley and Cartman blame the mess on each other, but Liane, being inebriated, passes out without noticing the mess. Shelley, amazed that they got out of the situation unscathed, celebrates by dancing with Eric as he sings his version of the Wild, Wild West song. Cultural references When Cartman takes the picture of Shelly and Skyler kissing, he exclaims \\"Ha ha! Charade you are!\\" which is the refrain of the Pink Floyd song \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones).‚Äù Cartman parodies the Newt character from the film Aliens several times, with a play on her original line of \\"They mostly come at night....mostly\\" (referring to the alien). Throughout the episode, while playing with his toys, Cartman makes allusions to the 1999 film Wild Wild West. Coincidentally, Wild Wild West was released on the same day as South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, two weeks before the original broadcast of this episode. The makers of South Park were disappointed that Wild Wild West performed better at the box office than their film despite Wild Wild West being critically panned; and some underage moviegoers snuck into the R-rated South Park film after having bought tickets to the PG-13-rated Wild Wild West.

Sellers. It is based on the crimes of Canadian serial killers Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka.  Plot  On 11 May 2000, a psychologist, Dr. Arnold, is conducting a session with Karla Homolka at Canada's Regional Psychiatric Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Dr. Arnold's evaluation will determine Karla's eligibility for parole. During the session, Dr. Arnold shows Karla a photo album of herself, and her husband, Paul Bernardo, in happier times. Karla has a memory of how they first met. However, when Dr. Arnold introduces the subject of Karla's sister, Tammy Homolka, Karla becomes uncooperative. Over the following weeks, Dr. Arnold probes Karla about her knowledge of Paul's secret life as a serial rapist. It is revealed that shortly before their marriage, Paul began to rape women. Paul convinced Karla to help him rape Tammy on camera. At first Karla disagrees, but eventually steals Halcion from the veterinary clinic where she works. Tammy gets drunk at a Christmas party and becomes unresponsive after the two drug her. Tammy is raped, and ends up getting sick while drugged, choking on her own vomit. Karla calls 911, and the two hide the assault evidence so her death would appear accidental. Afterwards, Paul beats Karla for \\"ruining his movie\\". Karla learns never to ruin Paul's \\"movies\\". Karla tells Dr. Arnold that Paul became obsessed with Tammy, and kept watching the video after her death, even showing it to friends. Paul also threatened to reveal Karla's role in her sister's murder, if he should get into any more trouble, but Karla finally leaves him anyway. Paul is open with Karla about his crimes, yet Karla does not object to them, even when Paul begins to bring his victims home. Although disturbed at that part of Paul's life, Karla learns to accept it, knowing that she too will be killed if she does not. At Paul's request, Karla hesitantly participates in these assaults. Paul kidnaps a young girl, \\"Tina McCarthy\\", and forces her to undress on camera. Karla witnesses this, but is too afraid to tell anyone. Tina is held for 3 days, and is raped repeatedly while Karla is forced to videotape it all. During one such assault, Paul strangles Tina after she sees his face. Karla tries to convince him not to kill her, but he insists, telling her that Tina can identify them both. He cuts the body into pieces and seals them in cement blocks, which he then dumps into a lake. On the day of Paul and Karla's wedding, the girl's body is discovered, and identified by dental records. Paul stops raping and abducting for a time, but his anxiety and pent- up frustration cause him to become violent toward Karla. Paul's friends see the change in his personality and break off from him. Meanwhile Karla, suffering from the abuse and desperate to reclaim his affections, helps Paul abduct and rape another young girl, \\"Kaitlyn Ross\\". Kaitlyn is brutally raped by Paul. Karla watches the assault and begins to cry. Paul beats Karla and tells her that she is ruining his movie again. After Paul leaves, Karla is put in charge of Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn tells Karla that she is a victim too, and that this is not her fault. When asked why she stays, Karla simply says, \\"You don't understand\\". Karla explains to Dr. Arnold that she wanted to free Kaitlyn, but was afraid Paul would kill her if she did. Kaitlyn's disappearance immediately attracts a storm of media and police attention, so Paul kills her, to be rid of her. As part of the investigation, the police arrive at Paul's house. Paul is very cooperative so the police leave satisfied, but, afterwards, he beats Karla mercilessly. Karla takes refuge with friends before reporting the assault. Paul is then booked under domestic violence but is released after only one night in jail. Back at the Regional Psychiatric Centre, Dr. Arnold asks Karla about her relationship with her younger sister, Tammy, and her jealousy towards her, because of Paul's attraction to her. Karla confesses that Paul wanted to take Tammy's virginity and that he wanted Karla to \\"give\\" Tammy to him. Karla agreed to help him rape her sister. Shortly thereafter, the DNA samples Paul provided as part of the Scarborough rape investigation, are matched to the evidence found on one of the murder victims. Both Paul and Karla are subsequently arrested. During the trial, Paul testifies that Karla killed Kaitlyn Ross with a mallet. Karla denies all the killings. Paul is convicted on two counts of murder without any possibility of parole. Karla is given a sentence of twelve years in exchange for a guilty plea for manslaughter. A note explains that Karla's parole was denied, as the psychologist found her artificial, manipulative, and without remorse.

The script is based on court transcriptions, interviews and video shot by Homolka and Bernardo.  Release  The film caused significant controversy in Canada, where the families of victims Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy initially said that the film exploited the memory of their daughters. Politicians in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, including Attorney General Michael Bryant, called for a boycott of the film, and one Canadian theatre chain, Cineplex Odeon, stated that it would show the film only in its major urban markets in Toronto, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec and Ottawa, Ontario. The film was booked to debut at the 2005 Montreal World Film Festival, until a protest by Air Canada, a corporate sponsor of the festival, shelved the idea. Lawyer Tim Danson, who represented the French and Mahaffy families, watched a private screening of the film in September with the families in attendance. The following month, he announced that the families would not oppose the film's Canadian release. Actor Misha Collins, who played Bernardo, regretted being involved with the film after meeting a victim who escaped and has routinely told fans not to see the film or bring DVD copies to be signed.  Reception  Karla was deemed \\"a creepy but botched work\\" by Robert Koehler of Variety, who felt that the film was marred by its \\"choppy\\" direction, its sub-par production values, and its \\"confused\\" and \\"morally precarious\\" depiction of Homolka, which Koehler felt undermined her complicity in Bernardo's actions, writing, \\"There's a certain darkly suffocating quality to the chamber drama played out by these two sick souls, but the fact that the film is more willing to explicitly show Paul's constant beatings of Karla than the worst aspects of the killings underlines who is to be seen as the victim here.\\" The Globe and Mail's Rick Groen was similarly critical of the film emphasizing Homolka's suffering over that of her and Bernardo's victims, and further opined that the picture was both \\"inexcusably mundane\\" and lacking in substance before awarding it a final score of 1¬Ω out of a possible 4. Ken Eisner of The Georgia Straight condemned the film, deriding it as nothing more than a dull, clich√©d, and \\"slapdash portrait of serial killers\\" that was completely devoid of \\"depth, tension, or psychological insight.\\" While Louis B. Hobson (who called the film \\"disturbing\\" and \\"nauseating\\") of the Calgary Sun praised Misha Collins and Laura Prepon's acting and the restraint that Karla showed by not depicting or exaggerating \\"the worst excesses\\" of the crimes that it was dramatizing, he went on to write, \\"You don't recommend a movie such as Karla, even if you can appreciate the performances that make it unnerving.\\" The Winnipeg Sun's Pat St. Germaine lauded the film's acting, but also felt that it was a failure as a psychoanalytical character study, and concluded his review of it with, \\"Those who choose to see Karla will exit the theatre with much food for thought, but it's hard to imagine anyone will be enriched by it.\\" The film's inadequate exploration of Homolka's psyche was also a point of contention for Vue Weekly's Brian Gibson, who wrote, \\"There is little ambiguity or tension at the core of this basically hollow karaoke version of the Bernardo-Homolka murders. Joel Bender's movie never resorts to gore-porn or sleaze-sationalism, avoiding any shots of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy (given different names here) being beaten or raped, and the simulations of Bernardo's horrific films offer no flashes of nudity that would make us feel complicit with the sexual predator. But Karla seldom probes its title character's own complicity.\\" Bruce Kirkland of the Toronto Sun expressed annoyance over Karla's \\"awkward\\" and \\"clumsy\\" narrative, gave mild praise to both its stars' performances and its restrained portrayal of its subject matter, and ended his review of the film with, \\"This film is not for the families of the victims, nor is it watchable by anyone with strong feelings about the case. For others less impassioned, however, it is a flawed yet largely accurate portrait of rapist-killer Bernardo and the psychotic woman who became his partner in crime.\\" The film received a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

He was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn along with his two brothers. Early life Boston Custer was born in New Rumley, Ohio, one of five children born to Emanuel Henry Custer and Maria Ward Kirkpatrick Custer. In 1863, the family left Ohio and moved to Monroe, Michigan. Boston's older brother Nevin became a farmer due to asthma and rheumatism, while two other older brothers, George and Thomas (\\"Tom\\"), became military officers in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Boston had been unable to officially join the Army due to poor health. Battle Boston Custer's headstone (on the far left) at the Woodland Cemetery in Monroe, Michigan. A civilian contractor, Custer served as forage master for his brother George's U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment in the 1874 Black Hills expedition. He was employed as a guide, forager, packer and scout for the regiment for the 1876 expedition against the Lakota Indians. On June 25, 1876, along with his 18-year-old nephew Henry Armstrong \\"Autie\\" Reed, Custer was with the pack train at the rear of Lt. Col. George Custer's troops. Hearing from a messenger that Lt. Col. Custer had requested ammunition for an impending fight, they quickly left the pack train. The pair passed by Frederick Benteen's detachment and joined Custer's main column as it moved into position to attack a sprawling Indian village along the Little Big Horn River. Had they stayed with the pack train where they were assigned, Boston Custer and Autie Reed might have survived the battle. Death Like his brothers and nephew, Boston was killed at the area known as \\"Last Stand Hill\\". A marble marker commemorates the approximate place where his body was found and identified. Though originally buried on the battlefield, Autie Reed and Boston Custer's remains were exhumed, the only exceptions to the rule that only commissioned officers would be shipped home for reburial. They were reinterred January 8, 1878, at Woodland Cemetery in Monroe, Michigan, near today's Monroe County, Michigan Museum.

This is usually done with the intention to garner privileges or status that would not otherwise be available to that person (i.e., a minor misrepresenting their age in order to garner the privileges given to adults). It may be done through the use of oral or written statements or through the altering, doctoring or forging of vital records. On some occasions, age is increased so as to make cut-offs for minimum legal or employable age in showbusiness or professional sports. Sometimes it is not the people themselves who lower their public age, but others around them such as publicists, parents, and other handlers. Most cases involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme cases such as with Al Lewis and Charo, a decade has been added or subtracted. Official state documents (such as birth, marriage and death certificates, the census, and other identity documents) typically provide the correct date. Although uncommon in modern Western society, it is still possible for a person not to know their exact date of birth. Such a person may arbitrarily choose a date of birth which after later research is found to be false. This situation should not be considered age fabrication as there is no obvious intent to deceive on the part of the individual. Subtracting time from one's age is often known in English as \\"shaving\\", while adding time to one's age may be referred to as \\"napping\\".

Allen herself gave her year of birth as 1906, despite the fact the earthquake occurred three months before her birthday that year. When the 1900 United States Census became public information, the true year was revealed as 1895, which meant she was actually a few months older than her husband. *Sandra Bullock's birthdate was erroneously given as July 26 in 1965, 1966, and 1967 for most of her early career.

The December 18, 1878, birth date is maintained by his birth registry, his school leaving certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, and all other surviving pre-revolution documents. Russian playwright and historian Edward Radzinski argues in his book, Stalin, that Stalin changed the year to 1879 to have a national birthday celebration of his 50th birthday. He could not do it in 1928 because his rule was not absolute enough.

For the 25 years preceding the invention of the logarithm in 1614, it was the only known generally applicable way of approximating products quickly. Its name comes from the Greek prosthesis (œÄœÅœåœÉŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ) and aphaeresis (·ºÄœÜŒ±ŒØœÅŒµœÉŒπœÇ), meaning addition and subtraction, two steps in the process.Prosthaphaeresis, by Brian Borchers  History and motivation  A spherical triangle In sixteenth century Europe, celestial navigation of ships on long voyages relied heavily on ephemerides to determine their position and course. These voluminous charts prepared by astronomers detailed the position of stars and planets at various points in time. The models used to compute these were based on spherical trigonometry, which relates the angles and arc lengths of spherical triangles (see diagram, right) using formulas such as: :\\\\cos a = \\\\cos b \\\\cos c + \\\\sin b \\\\sin c \\\\cos \\\\alpha and :\\\\sin b \\\\sin \\\\alpha = \\\\sin a \\\\sin \\\\beta where a, b and c are the angles subtended at the centre of the sphere by the corresponding arcs. When one quantity in such a formula is unknown but the others are known, the unknown quantity can be computed using a series of multiplications, divisions, and trigonometric table lookups. Astronomers had to make thousands of such calculations, and because the best method of multiplication available was long multiplication, most of this time was spent taxingly multiplying out products. Mathematicians, particularly those who were also astronomers, were looking for an easier way, and trigonometry was one of the most advanced and familiar fields to these people. Prosthaphaeresis appeared in the 1580s, but its originator is not known for certain; its contributors included the mathematicians Ibn Yunis, Johannes Werner, Paul Wittich, Joost B√ºrgi, Christopher Clavius, and Fran√ßois Vi√®te. Wittich, Yunis, and Clavius were all astronomers and have all been credited by various sources with discovering the method. Its most well-known proponent was Tycho Brahe, who used it extensively for astronomical calculations such as those described above. It was also used by John Napier, who is credited with inventing the logarithms that would supplant it. Nicholas Copernicus mentions 'prosthaphaeresis' several times in his 1543 work De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, meaning the \\"great parallax\\" caused by the displacement of the observer due to the Earth's annual motion.  The identities  The trigonometric identities exploited by prosthaphaeresis relate products of trigonometric functions to sums. They include the following: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sin a \\\\sin b & = \\\\frac{\\\\cos(a - b) - \\\\cos(a + b)}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\cos a \\\\cos b & = \\\\frac{\\\\cos(a - b) + \\\\cos(a + b)}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\sin a \\\\cos b & = \\\\frac{\\\\sin(a + b) + \\\\sin(a - b)}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\cos a \\\\sin b & = \\\\frac{\\\\sin(a + b) - \\\\sin(a - b)}{2} \\\\end{align} The first two of these are believed to have been derived by Jost B√ºrgi, who related them to [Tycho?] Brahe; the others follow easily from these two. If both sides are multiplied by 2, these formulas are also called the Werner formulas.  The algorithm  Using the second formula above, the technique for multiplication of two numbers works as follows: # Scale down: By shifting the decimal point to the left or right, scale both numbers to values between -1 and 1 , to be referred to as \\\\cos \\\\alpha and \\\\cos \\\\beta . # Inverse cosine: Using an inverse cosine table, find two angles \\\\alpha and \\\\beta whose cosines are our two values. # Sum and difference: Find the sum and difference of the two angles. # Average the cosines: Find the cosines of the sum and difference angles using a cosine table and average them, giving (according to the second formula above) the product \\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\cos \\\\beta . # Scale up: Shift the decimal place in the answer the combined number of places we have shifted the decimal in the first step for each input, but in the opposite direction. For example, say we want to multiply 105 and 720. Following the steps: # Scale down: Shift the decimal point three places to the left in each. We get \\\\cos \\\\alpha = 0.105 and \\\\cos \\\\beta = 0.720 . # Inverse cosine: \\\\cos84^\\\\circ is about 0.105 and \\\\cos44^\\\\circ is about 0.720 . # Sum and difference: 84 + 44 = 128 and 84 - 44 = 40. # Average the cosines: \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\\\cos128^\\\\circ + \\\\cos40^\\\\circ) is about \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(-0.616 + 0.766) , or 0.075 . # Scale up: For each of 105 and 720 we shifted the decimal point three places to the left, so in the answer we shift six places to the right. The result is 75,000. This is very close to the actual product, 75,600 (a percent error of ‚âà0.8%). If we want the product of the cosines of the two initial values, which is useful in some of the astronomical calculations mentioned above, this is surprisingly even easier: only steps 3 and 4 above are necessary. To divide, we exploit the definition of the secant as the reciprocal of the cosine. To divide 3500 by 70 , we scale the numbers to 0.35 and 7.0 . The cosine of 69.5^\\\\circ is 0.35 . Then use a table of secants to find out that 7.0 is the secant of 81.8^\\\\circ . This means that 1/7.0 is the cosine of 81.8^\\\\circ , and so we can multiply 0.35 by 1/7.0 using the above procedure. Average the cosine of the sum of the angles, 81.8^\\\\circ+69.5^\\\\circ=151.3^\\\\circ , with the cosine of their difference, 81.8^\\\\circ-69.5^\\\\circ=12.3^\\\\circ : \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\\\cos151^\\\\circ + \\\\cos 12.3^\\\\circ) is about \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(-0.877 + 0.977) , or 0.050 Scaling up to locate the decimal point gives the approximate answer, 50 Algorithms using the other formulas are similar, but each using different tables (sine, inverse sine, cosine, and inverse cosine) in different places. The first two are the easiest because they each only require two tables. Using the second formula, however, has the unique advantage that if only a cosine table is available, it can be used to estimate inverse cosines by searching for the angle with the nearest cosine value. Notice how similar the above algorithm is to the process for multiplying using logarithms, which follows these steps: scale down, take logarithms, add, take inverse logarithm, scale up. It's no surprise that the originators of logarithms had used prosthaphaeresis. Indeed the two are closely related mathematically. In modern terms, prosthaphaeresis can be viewed as relying on the logarithm of complex numbers, in particular on Euler's formula: :e^{ix}=\\\\cos x + i \\\\sin x  Decreasing the error  If all the operations are performed with high precision, the product can be as accurate as desired. Although sums, differences, and averages are easy to compute with high precision, even by hand, trigonometric functions and especially inverse trigonometric functions are not. For this reason, the accuracy of the method depends to a large extent on the accuracy and detail of the trigonometric tables used. For example, a sine table with an entry for each degree can be off by as much as 0.0087 if we just round an angle off to the nearest degree; each time we double the size of the table (for example by giving entries for every half-degree instead of every degree) we halve this error. Tables were painstakingly constructed for prosthaphaeresis with values for every second, or 3600th of a degree. Inverse sine and cosine functions are particularly troublesome, because they become steep near ‚àí1 and 1. One solution is to include more table values in this area. Another is to scale the inputs to numbers between ‚àí0.9 and 0.9. For example, 950 would become 0.095 instead of 0.950. Another effective approach to enhancing the accuracy is linear interpolation, which chooses a value between two adjacent table values. For example, if we know the sine of 45¬∞ is about 0.707 and the sine of 46¬∞ is about 0.719, we can estimate the sine of 45.7¬∞ as 0.707 √ó (1 ‚àí 0.7) + 0.719 √ó 0.7 = 0.7154. The actual sine is 0.7157. A table of cosines with only 180 entries combined with linear interpolation is as accurate as a table with about 45000 entries without it. Even a quick estimate of the interpolated value is often much closer than the nearest table value. See lookup table for more details.  Reverse identities  The product formulas can also be manipulated to obtain formulas that express addition in terms of multiplication. Although less useful for computing products, these are still useful for deriving trigonometric results: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sin a + \\\\sin b & = 2 \\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{a + b}{2} \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{a - b}{2} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\sin a - \\\\sin b & = 2 \\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{a + b}{2} \\\\right) \\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{a - b}{2} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\cos a + \\\\cos b & = 2 \\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{a + b}{2} \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{a - b}{2} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\cos a - \\\\cos b & = -2 \\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{a + b}{2} \\\\right) \\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{a - b}{2} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} References See also Slide rule  External links  Prosthaphaeresis formulas * Daniel E.

Forty three of its living languagesEthnologue, \\"Languages of Uganda\\" (lists also 2 languages with no speakers, English, Swahili, and Ugandan Sign Language for a total of 45) fall into four main families‚ÄîBantu, Nilotic and Central Sudanic‚Äîwith another two languages in the Kuliak family. Of these, 41 are indigenous and 2 are non-indigenous. Furthermore, 5 are institutional, 27 are developing, 7 are vigorous, 2 are in trouble, and 2 are dying. English, inherited from the colonial period, and Swahili are the official languages; the latter was added in 2005. There is also a Ugandan Sign Language.  Languages  In all of the Bantu speaking areas of Uganda, dialect continua are very common. For example, people around Mbarara speak Runyankore and people from Fort Portal in Tooro Kingdom speak Rutooro, but in the area between those towns, there are villages where most of the people speak a dialect that is best characterised as intermediate between Runyankore and Rutooro. In recognition of the closeness of four of these languages (Runyankore, Rutooro, Rukiga and Runyoro), and to facilitate work in them such as teaching, a standardised version called \\"Runyakitara\\" was developed around 1990. In south central Uganda, the Bantu languages of Luganda and Lusoga are largely interintelligible. This dialectic similarity also extends to the Lussese language spoken in the Ssese Islands of Lake Victoria. Of Nilo- Saharan, the Eastern Sudanic branch is well represented by several Nilotic languages, eastern as well as western. Eastern Nilotic languages include Karamojong of eastern Uganda (population 370,000), the Bari languages in the extreme north-western corner (about 150,000 population) and Teso south of Lake Kyoga (999,537 population). Alur (population 459,000), Acholi, Lango, Adhola and Kuman of eastern Uganda are Western Nilotic Luo languages. (Acholi and Lango are interintelligible, and sometimes the term \\"Luo\\" is used to cover them.) Some southern Nilotic Kalenjin languages are spoken along the border with Kenya, including Pokot and the Elgon languages near Kupsabiny. The eastern Ugandan Kuliak languages Ik and Soo are also members of the Eastern Sudanic branch. Lugbara, Aringa, Ma'di and Ndo of north-western Uganda are languages of the Central Sudanic branch of Nilo-Saharan. Language policy In Uganda, as in many African countries, English was introduced in government and public life by way of missionary work and the educational system. During the first decades of the twentieth century, Swahili gained influence as it was not only used in the army and the police, but was also taught in schools. The Ganda viewed the introduction of Swahili as a threat to their political power and partly through their influence, English remained the only official language at that time. Upon Uganda's independence in 1962, English was maintained as the official language, as it was already rooted deeply in administration, media and education. Also, Uganda's ethnolinguistic diversity made it difficult to choose another language as the official language of Uganda. After independence, there were efforts to choose an indigenous official language, with Swahili and Luganda as the most considered candidates. Although Luganda was the most geographically spread language, people outside Buganda were opposed to having it as a national language,Ladefoged et al., 1972:28-30 as were those of the Buganda kingdom because they felt other tribes' mispronunciation and grammar errors would ruin their language. English remained the official language.Mpuga 2003 The native languages of the Ugandan people have influenced Ugandan English. = Uganda National Kiswahili Council = In 2010, government of Uganda revealed plans to establish a Kiswahili Council to boost the teaching of Swahili language in the country. It was not until September 9, 2019 that the cabinet passed resolution to create the National Kishwahili Council. The National Swahili Council is meant to guide the planning process, implementation of interventions and allocation of resources to the usage and development of Kiswahili as a Lingua franca-a language that is adopted as a common language between speakers whose native languages are different considering the fact that Uganda is the most ethnically diverse nation in Africa, and disputably, the world.

Two state parks are located at the northern and southern bases of the mountain‚ÄîWinslow State Park and Rollins State Park, respectively‚Äîand the entire mountain is within Kearsarge Mountain State Forest. On a very clear day, skyscrapers in the city of Boston away are visible from the fire tower on the summit. The summit has remained bare since a 1796 forest fire. The name of the mountain evolved from a 1652 rendering of the native Pennacook tribal name for the mountain, Carasarga, which it is surmised means \\"notch-pointed- mountain of pines\\". Geography Kearsarge is a monadnock, and although of only moderate elevation, its isolation gives it of relative height above the low ground separating it from the higher mountains farther north. That makes Kearsarge one of twelve mountains in New Hampshire with a prominence over . Mount Kearsarge stands within the watershed of the Merrimack River, which drains into the Gulf of Maine. The western slopes of the mountain drain into Cascade Brook, which flows north to the Blackwater River, a stream which flows around the northern and eastern base of Kearsarge, eventually draining into the Contoocook River, a tributary of the Merrimack. The northern and eastern slopes of the mountain drain more directly into the Blackwater River. The southern face of Mount Kearsarge drains into Meadow Brook, a tributary of the Warner River, which flows southeast to the Contoocook River. Kearsarge is a popular hiking destination. The summit is the high point along the Sunapee- Ragged-Kearsarge Greenway hiking trail which links 10 towns and encircles the Kearsarge-Lake Sunapee region of western New Hampshire. The quickest route to the top is from the Rollins State Park picnic area on the mountain's south ridge, accessible via Kearsarge Mountain Road from the town of Warner. Access on the mountain's western side is from the picnic area of Winslow State Park via the Winslow Trail (1.1 mi) or the Barlow Trail (1.6 mi.), built in 1997 by Trailwrights, a volunteer trail group, for the SRK Greenway. The full Greenway section hike on Mt. Kearsarge covers from Winslow picnic area via the Barlow Trail to the summit and via the Rollins and Lincoln trails southwesterly to Kearsarge Valley Road in North Sutton. The Winslow Trail and the state park on the Wilmot side are named after Admiral John Winslow, the commander of the USS Kearsarge, which in June 1864 sank the CSS Alabama in the English Channel in a famous Civil War sea battle. More directly, the park is named after a hotel that stood on the grounds, the Winslow House, site of the current picnic grounds.  See also  Summit of Mt.

The film stars Jason Schwartzman, John Leguizamo, Mena Suvari, Patrick Fugit, Peter Stormare, Alexis Arquette, Deborah Harry, Rob Halford, Eric Roberts, Chloe Hunter, Nicholas Gonzalez, Brittany Murphy and Mickey Rourke. It is √Ökerlund's debut as a feature film director, having already become known for his work in music videos. The film was shot in 22 days, and centers on various people involved in a methamphetamine drug ring. The film blends elements of dark comedy and drama in its storytelling. Its title is a reference to the slang term for the way users feel after going multiple days without sleep while on a methamphetamine binge. The characters take a combined total of 23 \\"hits\\" during the course of the movie. Plot Ross (Jason Schwartzman) is a customer of Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a methamphetamine dealer. Spider Mike and his girlfriend Cookie (Mena Suvari) are constantly arguing, and Ross strikes up a friendship with Nikki (Brittany Murphy), a fellow addict. Nikki takes Ross to meet her boyfriend, \\"The Cook\\" (Mickey Rourke), who supplies Spider Mike with drugs from a meth lab he has set up in a motel room. The Cook gives a small amount of meth to Ross in exchange for bringing Nikki home, and says that he will get in touch with Ross if he needs a driver. Back at his apartment, Ross gets messages from his mother and his former girlfriend, Amy, wishing him a happy birthday. Ross, assuming that Amy still loves him, sporadically calls her and leaves messages on her answering machine. He then goes to the local strip club while high, leading to an intense pornographic hallucination. He takes April (Chloe Hunter), one of the dancers he has a relationship with, home and has sex with her in a variety of positions, the last of which leaves her tied to the bed naked. As they finish, the Cook calls with an emergency regarding Nikki's dog, Taco, which needs to be taken to the veterinarian. April tells him to untie her but Ross, still high, duct-tapes April's eyes and mouth shut to keep her quiet and leaves her bound to the bed, playing music to cover her gagged screams. Elsewhere, two policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) working with a TV crew raid the trailer where Frisbee (Patrick Fugit), another one of Spider Mike's customers, lives, falsely believing that a meth lab is located there. They take Frisbee and his overweight mother into custody and threaten him into helping them on a drug bust against Spider Mike. After driving the Cook around town to buy ephedrine pills, beer, and pornography, Ross returns to his apartment to apologize to April. In the Cook's motel room, he and Nikki have a fight after a prostitute arrives in response to the Cook's inviting her around. Nikki ends their relationship, and calls Ross and asks him to take her to a bus station so she can go back to Las Vegas, which Ross does, again leaving April still tied to the bed. While Ross and Nikki are out, Frisbee, now wearing a wire, visits Spider Mike to buy some meth so the cops can arrest him. When he enters, Cookie attempts to seduce him, as revenge for Spider Mike using a phone sex line, but finds the wire. As the cops burst in, a furious Spider Mike shoots Frisbee in the testicles; Spider Mike and Cookie are both arrested, and Frisbee is taken to the hospital. After Ross and Nikki go back to his apartment and find April gone (rescued by his lesbian neighbor (Deborah Harry)), Ross finally drops Nikki off at the bus station, where they share a kiss, and hope to reunite if he ever goes to Vegas. Meanwhile, the Cook's meth lab catches fire and destroys the motel room; he flees to the adult film store, where he is arrested after the owner (Rob Halford) calls the police. Once the Cook makes bail, he calls Ross asking for a ride to another dealer's (Eric Roberts) house in the city, which Ross agrees to do so that he can see Amy, who also lives in the city. The dealer provides the Cook with cash, some meth, and the equipment to start a new lab. The Cook promises Ross six months' worth of meth in exchange for being his chauffeur; he agrees on the condition that he can see Amy first. Amy, who has gotten her life together, wants no part of him after seeing that he still uses drugs and can only give her $100 of the $450 he owes her. As all the other characters go to sleep, the Cook drives a depressed Ross out to an old trailer in the countryside. Ross naps in his car as the Cook sets up a new lab in the trailer, only to blow it and himself up in the process.

The website's critics consensus reads: \\"A chaotic drug movie that has little substance behind the stylistic flash.\\" Time Out London was particularly harsh, accusing the film of \\"smug amoralism\\", and claiming that √Ökerlund simply re-uses other people's ideas and techniques. Roger Ebert was more sympathetic in his review, where he described the film as having \\"effortless wickedness\\". His main appraisal is the fact that the film in no way attempts to romanticise any of the characters and further goes on to say, \\"it's interesting how this story and these people seem to have been living before the movie began and will continue after it is over; instead of a plot, we drop in on their lives\\". Ebert does, however, explicitly mention the similarities between this and the earlier Requiem for a Dream. This comparison may not have been lost on the filmmakers. The title on a pornographic tape purchased by a character reads \\"Rectum for a Dream\\", and the scenes which show consumption of the drug also show its dilating effect on the pupils in fast cutscenes. Soundtrack The original music for Spun was written by Billy Corgan. The soundtrack to the film features songs by artists such as Iron Maiden and UFO (performed by The Djali Zwan), Ozzy Osbourne, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Blues Traveler, Bathory (for whom √Ökerlund once briefly played drums), Richie Havens, Phantom Planet (with whom Jason Schwartzman played drums at the time), Per Gessle (half of Roxette), Paola, and Satyricon, whose video for the song \\"Mother North\\" appears in the movie.

German Foreign Minister Julius Curtius, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson, German Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning, British Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald and (later dismissed) Ministerpr√§sident of Prussia Otto Braun. The photo was taken during a ship excursion on the Wannsee, Berlin. The Preu√üenschlag of 1932 (, Prussian coup), also known in English as the coup in Prussia or the putsch in Prussia, was the takeover of the Free State of Prussia, the largest State of the German Reich, by Chancellor Franz von Papen, using an emergency decree issued by President Paul von Hindenburg under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution on July 20, 1932. It was a major step towards the end of the Weimar Republic, as it later facilitated the Nazification () of Germany after Adolf Hitler's rise to power on 30 January 1933. The pretext for this measure was violent unrest in some areas of Prussia and the alleged inability of the Prussian government to handle the matter. The main trigger was the \\"\\" (\\"Altona Bloody Sunday\\"), a violent clash between the SA and Communists in Altona on 17 July 1932. 18 people died, 16 of them by police bullets.Heinrich Breloer, Horst K√∂nigstein: Blutgeld. Materialien zu einer deutschen Geschichte, 1982, , p. 22. It is more likely however that the Prussian government headed by Minister-President Otto Braun, with authority over the powerful Prussian police force, was simply one of the last major forces standing in the way of Papen's plans for nationalist rule.: :Immer wieder haben Konservative, Monarchisten und zuletzt sogar offen der Hohenzollern-Kronprinz eine Beseitigung der ‚Äûrepublikanischen Festung Preu√üen‚Äú, dieses ‚Äûmarxistischen Spuks‚Äù, gefordert. [Again and again, conservatives, monarchists, and lately even the Hohenzollern crown prince have openly demanded the ousting of the \\"republican stronghold of Prussia\\", of this \\"Marxist spook\\".] The move was facilitated by the unstable situation of the Prussian government. The centre- left coalition of the Social Democrats, Centre Party and liberal German Democratic Party had ruled Prussia without interruption since 1918, but had lost its majority in the Landtag (state parliament) in the election on 24 April 1932. However, under the Prussian constitution, a government could be removed from office only if there was a positive majority for a prospective successor. This provision, known as a \\"constructive vote of no confidence,\\" was intended to ensure that a government had sufficient support to govern. The Communists and National Socialists held over half the seats between them, but would not cooperate with each other or with other parties. Thus, no politically realistic alternative government was possible, and the Braun-led coalition remained in office. However, Papen also lacked majority support in the Reichstag. His only means to govern was through the emergency provisions of Article 48, and hence via decrees issued by the Reichspr√§sident Hindenburg, over whom Papen had great influence. The emergency decree of July 20 dismissed the Braun government and declared Papen Reichskommissar (Reich Commissioner) for Prussia, vested in him all the competences of the Prussian ministries, and gave him direct control over the Prussian government.: :Ein Tag als Lehrst√ºck: f√ºr die antidemokratische Skrupellosigkeit der Konservativen jener Jahre, f√ºr die Hilflosigkeit und Ermattung der stets nur rhetorisch kraftvoll auftretenden Sozialdemokratie, f√ºr die Erosion und den Zerfall der republiktreuen Mitte - schon Monate vor der Etablierung des NS-Regimes. [One day as an object lesson: in the antidemocratic unscrupulousness of the conservatives of those years, in the helplessness and fatigue of the Social Democrats, who only rhetorically ever seemed powerful, in the erosion and breakup of the republican center ‚Äî months before the establishment of the Nazi regime.] The decree was declared partially unconstitutional on October 25, 1932, by the German , but only in so far as the formal existence of the Prussian cabinet was concerned. The transfer of power to Papen was upheld, while the Braun cabinet retained the right to represent Prussia in the Reichsrat. Prussia remained under direct administration of the federal government until April 1933. The Enabling Act of 1933 gave Hitler the effective power to enact legislation (including extraconstitutional laws) without the consent of the Reichstag. One of Hitler's uses of the Enabling Act was to dissolve all of the state parliaments (except Prussia's) and reconstitute them based on the results of the partly-free federal election held in March (with the exception of Communist seats). Prussia was excluded from this measure because it had held state elections at the same time, with a similar result (a Nazi plurality). With the Communists now banned and most Social Democrats either jailed or in exile (the SPD would be banned outright in June), the Nazis now had a majority in the Prussian parliament, which elected Hermann G√∂ring as Minister-President. However, under Hitler's rule, German states were effectively replaced by Nazi Gaue, so G√∂ring's post was largely ceremonial. The state of Prussia was finally dissolved by the Allies after the end of World War II.

They then entered the Federal Amateur Hockey League in 1904 when Le National and the Montreal Montagnards fielded a joint team for that season. The following season, the agreement with Le Montagnard fell apart after Didier Pitre and Jack Laviolette left to play professional hockey in Pittsburgh, so the Nationals joined the Canadian Amateur Hockey League in 1905. After flirting with these organized leagues (the Nationals more often than not preferred to play challenge games as an independent), they joined the brand new Canadian Hockey Association in 1910 as a professional entity. After the CHA essentially merged with the National Hockey Association, the Nationals were offered a chance to join the NHA replacing the newly established Montreal Canadiens as the French-Canadian entity in that league, but opted not to. The club then returned to their amateur roots by joining the Montreal City Hockey League in 1911 and briefly played in the rival Montreal Hockey League as well as the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union, before returning to the MCHL in 1919. They stayed with that league through its various name changes (the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey League in 1923 and the Senior Group Hockey League in 1925). For their final season in 1926/27, the Montreal Nationals merged with the intermediate Montreal St Francois Xavier Hockey Club to form the Montreal/St Francois Nationals. After that one season, the club finally folded. Junior team The Montreal Nationals organization also iced a junior team alongside the more popular senior team in 1920. The team played in the Junior Amateur Hockey Association. The team was shut down in 1925 but reactivated in 1944. In 1949, the league was renamed the Quebec Junior Hockey League. The team was shut down again in 1952 but reactivated one final time in 1956 in the Metropolitan Montreal Junior Hockey League. In 1958 the club was renamed the Palestre Nationals. In 1969, the MMJHL merged with the Quebec Junior Hockey League to form the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. That year the team moved out to the Montreal borough of Rosemont to become the Rosemont Nationals. In 1971, the club moved out to the Montreal suburb of Laval to become the Laval Nationals. In 1975, after 50 years of operation, the Montreal Nationals organization folded. The team still used the Nationals name for the next few seasons, but after coach Jean Rougeau left the club they were renamed the Laval Voisins. Today the club is the Acadie‚ÄìBathurst Titan. Lacrosse A 1910 Imperial Tobacco trading card featuring Newsy Lalonde playing for the Montreal Nationals lacrosse team. When an organization had both lacrosse and hockey teams, it was common for players to play for both teams. As well as their hockey team, the Montreal Nationals also had a lacrosse team, which was actually established first, in 1894. In 1897, they won the intermediate league, and in 1898 the senior league. Becoming professional in 1910, they won the Eastern Canada championship, but lost to New Westminster in the Canadian championship.

Stages of early mitosis in a vertebrate cell with micrographs of chromatids Prometaphase is the phase of mitosis following prophase and preceding metaphase, in eukaryotic somatic cells. In prometaphase, the nuclear membrane breaks apart into numerous \\"membrane vesicles\\", and the chromosomes inside form protein structures called kinetochores. Kinetochore microtubules emerging from the centrosomes at the poles (ends) of the spindle reach the chromosomes and attach to the kinetochores, throwing the chromosomes into agitated motion. Other spindle microtubules make contact with microtubules coming from the opposite pole. Forces exerted by protein \\"motors\\" associated with spindle microtubules move the chromosomes toward the centre of the cell. Prometaphase is not always presented as a distinct part of mitosis. In sources that do not use the term, the events described here are instead assigned to late prophase and early metaphase. Types of microtubules The microtubules are composed of two types, kinetochore microtubules and non-kinetochore microtubules. * Kinetochore microtubules begin searching for kinetochores to attach to. * A number of non-kinetochore microtubules or polar microtubules find and interact with corresponding nonkinetochore microtubules from the opposite centrosome to form the mitotic spindle. Transition from prometaphase to metaphase The role of prometaphase is completed when all of the kinetochore microtubules have attached to their kinetochores, upon which metaphase begins. An unattached kinetochore, and thus a non-aligned chromosome, even when most of the other chromosomes have lined up, will trigger the spindle checkpoint signal. This prevents premature progression into anaphase by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex until all kinetochores are attached and all the chromosomes aligned. Early events of metaphase can coincide with the later events of prometaphase, as chromosomes with connected kinetochores will start the events of metaphase individually before other chromosomes with unconnected kinetochores that are still lingering in the events of prometaphase.

A B√ºchner flask, also known as a vacuum flask,The use of the term vacuum flask sometimes causes confusion with the Thermos flask filter flask, suction flask, side-arm flask, Kitasato flask or Bunsen flask, is a thick-walled Erlenmeyer flask with a short glass tube and hose barb protruding about an inch from its neck. The short tube and hose barb effectively act as an adapter over which the end of a thick-walled flexible hose (tubing) can be fitted to form a connection to the flask. The other end of the hose can be connected to source of vacuum such as an aspirator, vacuum pump, or house vacuum. Preferably this is done through a trap (see below), which is designed to prevent the sucking back of water from the aspirator into the B√ºchner flask. The thick wall of the B√ºchner flask provides it the strength to withstand the pressure difference while holding a vacuum inside. It is primarily used together with a B√ºchner funnel fitted through a drilled rubber bung or an elastomer adapter (a B√ºchner ring) at the neck on top of the flask for the filtration of samples. The B√ºchner funnel holds the sample isolated from the suction by a layer of filter paper. During filtration, the filtrate enters and is held by the flask while the residue remains on the filter paper in the funnel. The B√ºchner flask can also be used as a vacuum trap in a vacuum line to ensure that no fluids are carried over from the aspirator or vacuum pump (or other vacuum source) to the evacuated apparatus or vice versa.

The type species is the Nile bichir (P. bichir). Fishes in this genus live in various areas in Africa. Polypterus is the only known vertebrate to have lungs, but no trachea. The etymology of the genus name derives from a combination of the Greek prefix œÄŒøŒªœÖ-, poly- (many) and the root word œÄœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ, pteron (wing or fin) - \\"many fins\\".  Recoil aspiration  In shallow water, Polypterus inhales primarily through its spiracle (blowhole). Exhalation is powered by muscles in the torso. During exhalation, the bony scales in the upper chest become indented. When the muscles are relaxed, the bony scales spring back into position, generating negative pressure within the torso, resulting in a rapid intake of air through the spiracle. The air is nearly sufficient to fill the lungs. This is followed by one cycle of buccal (mouth) pumping, which \\"tops off\\" the lungs, with the surplus air from the buccal pumping process discharged through the pharynx. According to one hypothesis, Devonian tetrapods may have inhaled in this way. Discovery Polypterus was discovered, described, and named in 1802 by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. It is a genus of 10 green to yellow-brown species. Naturalists were unsure whether to regard it as a fish or an amphibian. If it were a fish, what type was it: bony, cartilaginous, or lungfish?Hall (2001) Some regarded Polypterus as a living fossil, part of the missing link between fishes and amphibians, helping to show how fish fins had evolved to become paired limbs. In 1861, Thomas Huxley created the order Crossopterygii to house animals, fossil and living, that possessed lungs and fleshy pectoral fins with lobes. He placed Polypterus and Calamoichthys within this order, allocating them to a new tribe, Polypterini, which he created especially for them. The weight of Huxley's authority allowed this allocation to last in textbooks and lectures long after it had been disproved. In the 1870s and 1880s, Francis Balfour and his students had shown that embryology could help to answer questions about the evolution of species. No one had studied the embryology of Polypterus. Someone who could do this might prove the ‚Äúmissing link‚Äù theory and be greatly honoured, but it could be a dangerous quest. The only breeding Polypterus specimens were in swampy parts of African rivers. Africa was a turbulent place and swamps were rich breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying malaria. Two men, Nathan Harrington and John Samuel Budgett, attempted to answer this question by making repeated expeditions to Africa. Harrington failed on his first attempt in 1898 and died early on his second in 1899 before he could reach his destination. Budgett failed in 1898/9, 1900, and 1902. He finally succeeded in 1903, but died of blackwater fever shortly after his return to England. He left excellent samples and drawings, but his only writing was a diary. Consequently, his results on Polypterus were written up and published by his friend John Graham Kerr.Kerr, J.G. (1907) Drawing on this work, in 1907, E. S. Goodrich reported to the British Association the then current state of evidence 'against' Polypterus being a crossopterygian, placing it within the palaeoniscids, the most primitive actinopterygians.Goodrich (1908) Much later, in 1946, Romer, confirmed this view, but he also wrote, \\"The weight of Huxley's [1861] opinion is a heavy one, and even today many a text continues to cite Polypterus as a crossopterygian and it is so described in many a classroom, although students of fish evolution have realized the falsity of this position for many years. ... Polypterus ... is not a crossopterygian, but an actinopterygian, and hence can tell us nothing about crossopterygian anatomy and embryology.\\"Romer (1946), pp. 60-61, quoted by Hall Hall (2001), relying on Patterson (1982) and Noack et al. (1996), writes, \\"Phylogenetic analyses using both morphological and molecular data affirm Polypterus as a living stem actinopterygian.\\" Research is ongoing. Most of the conclusions drawn by Kerr from Budgett's specimens have been confirmed, but many questions remain. Polypterus has rarely been bred in captivity. The first success was that of Polypterus senegalus by Arnoult in 1964, a species spawned repeatedly since (see Hartl, 1981; Bartsch and Gemballa, 1992; Bartsch et al., 1997 and Schugardt, 1997). Shortly after Arnoult's success, a second species, Polypterus ornatipinnis, was spawned by Armbrust for the first time (1966 and 1973) and bred subsequently by Azuma in 1986; Wolf, 1992; Bartsch and Britz, 1996. The third species successfully spawned in captivity was Polypterus endlicheri by Azuma in 1995. Zoo Basel have been successful in breeding Polypterus in captivity. In December 2005, several eggs were laid, and at the beginning of 2006, six young hatched. Within two months, they reached 10 cm (about 4 in). In 2014 researchers at McGill University (published in the journal Nature) turned to Polypterus to help show what might have happened when fish first attempted to walk out of the water. The team of researchers raised juvenile Polypterus on land for nearly a year, with the aim of revealing how these 'terrestrialized' fish looked and moved differently.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu0LMnT9S4k  Species  Polypterus ansorgii Boulenger, 1910 (Guinean bichir) * Polypterus bichir Lac√©p√®de, 1803  P. b. bichir Lac√©p√®de, 1803 (Nile bichir)  P. b. katangae Poll, 1941  P. b. lapradei Steindachner, 1869 * Polypterus congicus Boulenger, 1898 (Congo bichir) * Polypterus delhezi Boulenger, 1899 (Barred bichir) * Polypterus endlicheri Heckel, 1847 * Polypterus mokelembembe Schliewen & Sch√§fer, 2006 (Mok√®l√©-mb√®mb√© bichir) * Polypterus ornatipinnis Boulenger, 1902 (Ornate bichir) * Polypterus palmas Ayres, 1850  P. p. buettikoferi Steindachner, 1891 (Buettikofer's bichir)  P. p. palmas Ayres, 1850 (Shortfin bichir) * Polypterus polli J.

Biography Gaines was invited by JoJo Billingsley and Ronnie Van Zant to join Lynyrd Skynyrd as a backup singer. She had never heard of the band at the time, so Billingsley lent her a copy of the band's first two albums: (Pronounced 'Lƒïh-'n√©rd 'Skin-'n√©rd) and Second Helping. In late 1975, Gaines, Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins formed The Honkettes, a female gospel vocal trio for Skynyrd. When Lynyrd Skynyrd was in need of a guitar player to replace recently departed Ed King, Cassie recommended her younger brother, Steve, who joined the band soon after. = Plane crash = On October 20, 1977, a Convair CV-240 carrying the band between shows from Greenville, South Carolina, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, crashed outside of Gillsburg, Mississippi. The crash killed Ronnie Van Zant, Steve and Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, as well as pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot William Gray.US NTSB Report on Plane Crash; NTSB; U.S. Government report; retrieved February 2016 Gaines had initially refused to board the flight and was convinced by other members against her better judgment. Her hesitation was due to a small fire on one of the engines the previous day. She intended to travel in the tour trucks but boarded the flight due to Van Zant's persuasion. Gaines survived the initial accident but bled to death while rescuers attempted to reach the accident site and remove victims for medical treatment. According to controversial claims by survivor Billy Powell, Gaines bled to death after the accident in Powell's arms from deep lacerations.  Burial  Cassie and Steve Gaines were buried in Orange Park, Florida. On February 15, 1979, the mother of Steve and Cassie, also named Cassie LaRue Gaines, was killed in an automobile accident near the cemetery where Steve and Cassie are buried.

Common names include cicada, harvestfly, jar fly, and the misnomer locust. Until recently, these species were all in the genus Tibicen, which was redefined in the twenty-first century to include only a few European species, while species from the Western United States and Mexico are now placed in a separate genus, Hadoa.http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2015/f/zt03985p251.pdf In addition, several former Neotibicen species have been moved to the genus Megatibicen. Neotibicen species are the most commonly encountered cicadas in the eastern United States. Unlike periodical cicadas, whose appearances aboveground occur at 13- or 17-year intervals, Neotibicen species can be seen every year, hence their nickname \\"annual cicadas\\". Despite their annual appearances, Neotibicen probably take multiple years to develop underground, because all cicada species for which life cycle lengths have been measured do so, except when growing as agricultural pests.Campbell et al., 2015, PNAS Vol. 112(33):10192-10199 Their annual reappearance is presumably due to overlapping generations. Neotibicen cicadas are long, with characteristic green, brown, and black markings on the top of the thorax, and tented, membranous wings extending past the abdomen. The fore wings are about twice the length of the hindwings. Adults feed using their beak to tap into the xylem of plants; nymphs feed from the xylem of roots.Elliott, Lang, and Wil Hershberger. 2007. The Songs of Insects. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. p. 184. Communication Like other members of the subfamily Cicadinae, Neotibicen species have loud, complex songs, even (in many cases) with distinct song phrases. Males produce loud calls in the afternoon or evening (depending on the species) to attract females. These sounds, distinctive for each species,Elliott, Lang, and Wil Hershberger. 2007. The Songs of Insects. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. p. 19. are produced by specialized tymbal organs on the abdomen as in most cicadas. These calls range from a loud buzz to a long rattling sound, sometimes with a pulsating quality.  Species and subspecies  These species and subspecies belong to the genus Neotibicen. Several species formerly in this genus were recently moved to Megatibicen, and one (Neotibicen longioperculus) was moved to the genus Hadoa. * Neotibicen auriferus (Say, 1825) ‚Äì Field cicada * Neotibicen bermudianus (Verrill, 1902) ‚Äì Bermuda cicada, PRESUMED EXTINCT * Neotibicen canicularis (Harris, 1841) ‚Äì Dog-day cicada or dog-day harvestfly * Neotibicen davisi davisi (Smith and Grossbeck, 1907) ‚Äì Davis's southeastern dog-day cicada * Neotibicen davisi harnedi (Davis, 1918) * Neotibicen latifasciatus (Davis, 1915) ‚Äì Coastal scissor grinder cicada * Neotibicen linnei (Smith and Grossbeck, 1907) ‚Äì Linne's cicada * Neotibicen lyricen engelhardti (Davis, 1910) * Neotibicen lyricen lyricen (De Geer, 1773) ‚Äì Lyric cicada * Neotibicen lyricen virescens (Davis, 1935) * Neotibicen pruinosus fulvus (Beamer, 1924) * Neotibicen pruinosus pruinosus (Say, 1825) ‚Äì Scissor grinder cicada * Neotibicen robinsonianus (Davis, 1922) ‚Äì Robinson's cicada * Neotibicen similaris apalachicola Marshall and Hill, 2017 * Neotibicen similaris similaris (Smith and Grossbeck, 1907) ‚Äì Similar dog-day cicada * Neotibicen superbus (Fitch, 1855) ‚Äì Superb southwestern cicada * Neotibicen tibicen australis (Davis, 1912) * Neotibicen tibicen tibicen (= Tibicen chloromerus) (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì Swamp cicada * Neotibicen winnemanna (Davis, 1912) ‚Äì Eastern scissor grinder cicada Predators Many animals feed on cicadas, which usually occurs during the final days when they become easy prey near the ground. One of the more notable predators is the cicada killer. This is a large wasp that catches the dog-day cicada. After catching and stinging the insect to paralyze it, the cicada killer carries it back to its hole and drags it underground to a chamber where it lays its eggs in the paralyzed cicada. When the eggs hatch, the wasp larvae feed on the paralyzed, but still living, cicada.

In 1931 he completed his dissertation on vernacular concrete architecture on the Greek Cyclades islands. He was convinced that modernism, but especially modern architecture got out of touch with the needs, and sensuality of mankind.  NYC MoMA exhibition  After having curated the highly controversial NYC MoMA-show \\"Are Clothes Modern?\\", an exhibition where Rudofsky argued that clothing lacked utility, and - due to its highly artificial nature - even had harming effects on the human body, Rudofsky developed the exhibition Architecture Without Architects, that was from 11 Nov. 1964-7 Feb. 1965 on show at the NYC MoMA. In 200 enlarged black- and-white-photographs, he showed various kinds of architectures, landscapes, and people living with or within architectures. Shown without texts or explanations, the visitors were just confronted with imagery that showed indigenous building traditions, which were very much at odds with the ideas of architectural modernism which had been promoted through NYC MoMA's Philip Johnson in his famous 1932 exhibition \\"Modern Architecture.

It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination. Gaussian smoothing is also used as a pre-processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scales‚Äîsee scale space representation and scale space implementation.  Mathematics  Mathematically, applying a Gaussian blur to an image is the same as convolving the image with a Gaussian function. This is also known as a two-dimensional Weierstrass transform. By contrast, convolving by a circle (i.e., a circular box blur) would more accurately reproduce the bokeh effect. Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, applying a Gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the image's high-frequency components; a Gaussian blur is thus a low pass filter. A halftone print rendered smooth through Gaussian blur The Gaussian blur is a type of image-blurring filters that uses a Gaussian function (which also expresses the normal distribution in statistics) for calculating the transformation to apply to each pixel in the image. The formula of a Gaussian function in one dimension is :G(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi \\\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2}} In two dimensions, it is the product of two such Gaussian functions, one in each dimension: :G(x,y) = \\\\frac{1} e^{-\\\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2}}Shapiro, L. G. & Stockman, G. C: \\"Computer Vision\\", page 137, 150. Prentice Hall, 2001Mark S. Nixon and Alberto S. Aguado. Feature Extraction and Image Processing. Academic Press, 2008, p. 88.R.A.

When applied in two dimensions, this formula produces a surface whose contours are concentric circles with a Gaussian distribution from the center point. Values from this distribution are used to build a convolution matrix which is applied to the original image. This convolution process is illustrated visually in the figure on the right. Each pixel's new value is set to a weighted average of that pixel's neighborhood. The original pixel's value receives the heaviest weight (having the highest Gaussian value) and neighboring pixels receive smaller weights as their distance to the original pixel increases. This results in a blur that preserves boundaries and edges better than other, more uniform blurring filters; see also scale space implementation. In theory, the Gaussian function at every point on the image will be non-zero, meaning that the entire image would need to be included in the calculations for each pixel. In practice, when computing a discrete approximation of the Gaussian function, pixels at a distance of more than 3œÉ have a small enough influence to be considered effectively zero. Thus contributions from pixels outside that range can be ignored. Typically, an image processing program need only calculate a matrix with dimensions \\\\lceil6\\\\sigma\\\\rceil √ó \\\\lceil6\\\\sigma\\\\rceil (where \\\\lceil \\\\cdot \\\\rceil is the ceiling function) to ensure a result sufficiently close to that obtained by the entire Gaussian distribution. In addition to being circularly symmetric, the Gaussian blur can be applied to a two-dimensional image as two independent one-dimensional calculations, and so is termed separable filter. That is, the effect of applying the two-dimensional matrix can also be achieved by applying a series of single-dimensional Gaussian matrices in the horizontal direction, then repeating the process in the vertical direction. In computational terms, this is a useful property, since the calculation can be performed in O\\\\left(w_\\\\text{kernel} w_\\\\text{image} h_\\\\text{image}\\\\right) + O\\\\left(h_\\\\text{kernel} w_\\\\text{image} h_\\\\text{image}\\\\right) time (where h is height and w is width; see Big O notation), as opposed to O\\\\left(w_\\\\text{kernel} h_\\\\text{kernel} w_\\\\text{image} h_\\\\text{image}\\\\right) for a non-separable kernel. Applying successive Gaussian blurs to an image has the same effect as applying a single, larger Gaussian blur, whose radius is the square root of the sum of the squares of the blur radii that were actually applied. For example, applying successive Gaussian blurs with radii of 6 and 8 gives the same results as applying a single Gaussian blur of radius 10, since \\\\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10. Because of this relationship, processing time cannot be saved by simulating a Gaussian blur with successive, smaller blurs ‚Äî the time required will be at least as great as performing the single large blur. Two downscaled images of the Flag of the Commonwealth of Nations. Before downscaling, a Gaussian blur was applied to the bottom image but not to the top image. The blur makes the image less sharp, but prevents the formation of moir√© pattern aliasing artifacts. Gaussian blurring is commonly used when reducing the size of an image. When downsampling an image, it is common to apply a low-pass filter to the image prior to resampling. This is to ensure that spurious high-frequency information does not appear in the downsampled image (aliasing). Gaussian blurs have nice properties, such as having no sharp edges, and thus do not introduce ringing into the filtered image.  Low-pass filter  Gaussian blur is a low-pass filter, attenuating high frequency signals.R.A. Haddad and A.N. Akansu, \\"A Class of Fast Gaussian Binomial Filters for Speech and Image Processing,\\" IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, vol. 39, pp 723-727, March 1991. Its amplitude Bode plot (the log scale in the frequency domain) is a parabola.  Variance reduction  How much does a Gaussian filter with standard deviation \\\\sigma_f smooth the picture? In other words, how much does it reduce the standard deviation of pixel values in the picture?

Implementation A Gaussian blur effect is typically generated by convolving an image with an FIR kernel of Gaussian values. In practice, it is best to take advantage of the Gaussian blur‚Äôs separable property by dividing the process into two passes. In the first pass, a one-dimensional kernel is used to blur the image in only the horizontal or vertical direction. In the second pass, the same one-dimensional kernel is used to blur in the remaining direction. The resulting effect is the same as convolving with a two- dimensional kernel in a single pass, but requires fewer calculations. Discretization is typically achieved by sampling the Gaussian filter kernel at discrete points, normally at positions corresponding to the midpoints of each pixel. This reduces the computational cost but, for very small filter kernels, point sampling the Gaussian function with very few samples leads to a large error. In these cases, accuracy is maintained (at a slight computational cost) by integration of the Gaussian function over each pixel's area.Erik Reinhard. High dynamic range imaging: Acquisition, Display, and Image-Based Lighting. Morgan Kaufmann, 2006, pp. 233‚Äì234. When converting the Gaussian‚Äôs continuous values into the discrete values needed for a kernel, the sum of the values will be different from 1. This will cause a darkening or brightening of the image. To remedy this, the values can be normalized by dividing each term in the kernel by the sum of all terms in the kernel. The efficiency of FIR breaks down for high sigmas. Alternatives to the FIR filter exist. These include the very fast multiple box blurs, the fast and accurate IIR Deriche edge detector, a \\"stack blur\\" based on the box blur, and more. (code doc) Common uses This shows how smoothing affects edge detection. With more smoothing, fewer edges are detected = Edge detection = Gaussian smoothing is commonly used with edge detection. Most edge-detection algorithms are sensitive to noise; the 2-D Laplacian filter, built from a discretization of the Laplace operator, is highly sensitive to noisy environments. Using a Gaussian Blur filter before edge detection aims to reduce the level of noise in the image, which improves the result of the following edge-detection algorithm. This approach is commonly referred to as Laplacian of Gaussian, or LoG filtering. = Photography = Lower-end digital cameras, including many mobile phone cameras, commonly use gaussian blurring to cover up image noise caused by higher ISO light sensitivities. Gaussian blur automatically is applied as part of the image post-processing of the photo by the camera software, leading to an irreversible loss of detail.

He played all or part of 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), with most of his career spent with the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Arizona Diamondbacks, then with several other teams during his last four years. A middle infielder, Womack was recognized for his speed and base-stealing prowess and his key hits in the 2001 playoffs which led to the 2001 World Series win over the New York Yankees. Early life Womack was born in Java, Virginia. He is a graduate of Gretna High School in Gretna, Virginia and Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina. Career Womack was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1991 MLB draft and became their everyday second baseman in 1997. That year, which was his first full year in the MLB, he played in his only All-Star Game and led the National League in stolen bases (60). In 1998, he again led the National League in stolen bases (58). After the 1998 season, he was traded to the Diamondbacks for two minor leaguers. The Diamondbacks moved Womack from second base to right field in 1999, then to shortstop in 2000. In 1999, Womack led the major leagues in stolen bases (72) which set a Diamondback record for most stolen bases in a season. Womack was an important part of the Arizona Diamondbacks' World Championship Team in 2001, especially with two key base hits that both came in the bottom of the ninth inning of deciding games in the playoffs. Womack ended the first-round series with a walk-off single off the Cardinals' Steve Kline. Later, Womack set up Luis Gonzalez' famous game-winning single in Game 7 of the World Series with a game-tying one-out hit against the Yankees' Mariano Rivera. Womack's game-tying double was cited by the Wall Street Journal as the most significant clutch hit in baseball history. Womack owns the Diamondbacks record for most stolen bases in a career (182). Womack signed with the Cardinals for 2004, and he was moved back to his original position at second base. After recovering from Tommy John surgery and a disappointing 2003 season, Womack batted a career-high .307 with five home runs, 38 runs batted in, and 26 stolen bases for the Cardinals. After the 2004 season, Womack chose to sign with the New York Yankees, rather than wait for the Cardinals to offer him an extension. Despite turning in a productive 2004, Womack struggled with the Yankees in 2005, losing his starting second base job to Robinson Can√≥. In 2006, after being released by the Reds, the Chicago Cubs signed him to a minor league deal and called him up on May 26. Womack was designated for assignment on June 30 and became a free agent on July 10. He received a non-roster invitation to spring training with the Washington Nationals for the 2007 season, but was released on March 8, ending his playing career.

He received many honorary degrees and was a fellow of multiple professional societies. At his death, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a \\"scholar and writer of imagination and grace,\\" whose reputation and accomplishments extended far beyond the campus where he taught for 30 years. Publishers Weekly referred to him as \\"the modern Thoreau.\\" The broad scope of his writing reflected upon such topics as the mind of Sir Francis Bacon, the prehistoric origins of man, and the contributions of Charles Darwin. Eiseley's reputation was established primarily through his books, including The Immense Journey (1957), Darwin's Century (1958), The Unexpected Universe (1969), The Night Country (1971), and his memoir, All the Strange Hours (1975). Science author Orville Prescott praised him as a scientist who \\"can write with poetic sensibility and with a fine sense of wonder and of reverence before the mysteries of life and nature.\\" Naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts saw his combination of literary and nature writings as his \\"quest, not simply for bringing together science and literature ... but a continuation of what the 18th and 19th century British naturalists and Thoreau had done.\\" In praise of \\"The Unexpected Universe\\", Ray Bradbury remarked, \\"[Eiseley] is every writer's writer, and every human's human ... One of us, yet most uncommon ...\\" According to his obituary in the New York Times, the feeling and philosophical motivation of the entire body of Eiseley's work was best expressed in one of his essays, The Enchanted Glass: \\"The anthropologist wrote of the need for the contemplative naturalist, a man who, in a less frenzied era, had time to observe, to speculate, and to dream.\\"Blum, Howard. Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature, New York Times, (Obituary) July 11, 1977. Shortly before his death he received an award from the Boston Museum of Science for his \\"outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science\\" and another from the U.S. Humane Society for his \\"significant contribution for the improvement of life and environment in this country.\\" Early life Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Eiseley lived his childhood with a hardworking father and deaf mother who may have suffered from mental illness. Their home was located on the outskirts of town where, as author Naomi Brill writes, it was \\"removed from the people and the community from which they felt set apart through poverty and family misfortune.\\"Brill, Naomi. Loren Eiseley Society (LES) His autobiography, All the Strange Hours, begins with his \\"childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents.\\" His father, Clyde, was a hardware salesman who worked long hours for little pay, writes Brill. However, as an amateur Shakespearean actor, he was able to give his son a \\"love for beautiful language and writing.\\" His mother, Daisey Corey, was a self-taught prairie artist who was considered a beautiful woman. She lost her hearing as a child and sometimes exhibited irrational and destructive behavior. This left Eiseley feeling distant from her and may have contributed to his parents' unhappy marriage. Living at the edge of town, however, led to Eiseley's early interest in the natural world, to which he turned when being at home was too difficult. There, he would play in the caves and creek banks nearby.Minnesota State University EMuseum's Eiseley biography (Internet Archive of website defunct since 2011), Retrieved 2015-10-16 Fortunately, there were others who opened the door to a happier life. His half-brother, Leo, for instance, gave him a copy of Robinson Crusoe, with which he taught himself to read. Thereafter, he managed to find ways to get to the public library and became a voracious reader. Eiseley later attended the Lincoln Public Schools; in high school, he wrote that he wanted to be a nature writer. He would later describe the lands around Lincoln as \\"flat and grass-covered and smiling so serenely up at the sun that they seemed forever youthful, untouched by mind or timea sunlit, timeless prairie over which nothing passed but antelope or wandering bird.\\" But, disturbed by his home situation and the illness and recent death of his father, he dropped out of school and worked at menial jobs. Eiseley enrolled in the University of Nebraska, where he wrote for the newly formed journal, Prairie Schooner, and went on archaeology digs for the school's natural history museum, Morrill Hall. In 1927, however, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and left the university to move to the western desert, believing the drier air would improve his condition. While there, he soon became restless and unhappy, which led him to hoboing around the country by hopping on freight trains (as many did during the Great Depression).Eiseley, Loren. All the Strange Hours, (1975) Scribner Professor of religion, Richard Wentz, writes about this period: > Loren Eiseley had been a drifter in his youth. From the plains of Nebraska > he had wandered across the American West. Sometimes sickly, at other times > testing his strength with that curious band of roving exiles who searched > the land above the rippling railroad ties, he explored his soul as he sought > to touch the distant past. He became a naturalist and a bone hunter because > something about the landscape had linked his mind to the birth and death of > life itself.Wentz, Richard E., The American Spirituality of Loren Eiseley > Christian Century, April 25, 1984, Academic career Eiseley eventually returned to the University of Nebraska and received a B.A. degree in English and a B.S. degree in Geology/Anthropology. While at the university, he served as editor of the literary magazine The Prairie Schooner, and published his poetry and short stories. Undergraduate expeditions to western Nebraska and the southwest to hunt for fossils and human artifacts provided the inspiration for much of his early work. He later noted that he came to anthropology from paleontology, preferring to leave human burial sites undisturbed unless destruction threatened them. Eiseley received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937 and wrote his dissertation entitled \\"Three Indices of Quaternary Time and Their Bearing Upon Pre-History: a Critique\\", which launched his academic career. He began teaching at the University of Kansas that same year. During World War II, Eiseley taught anatomy to reservist pre- med students at Kansas. In 1944 he left the University of Kansas to assume the role of head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Oberlin College in Ohio. In 1947 he returned to the University of Pennsylvania to head its Anthropology Department. He was elected president of the American Institute of Human Paleontology in 1949. From 1959 to 1961, he was provost at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1961 the University of Pennsylvania created a special interdisciplinary professorial chair for him. Eiseley was also a fellow of many distinguished professional societies, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Philosophical Society. At the time of his death in 1977, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science, and the curator of the Early Man section at the University of Pennsylvania Museum.University of Pennsylvania Almanac, Loren Eiseley‚Äôs 100th Birthday Celebration at the Penn Museum October 30, 2007 He had received thirty-six honorary degrees over a period of twenty years, and was the most honored member of the University of Pennsylvania since Benjamin Franklin.

Anthropologist Pat Shipman writes, > the words that flowed from his pen ... the images and insights he revealed, > the genius of the man as a writer, outweigh his social disability.

An Anthropologist With BiteNew > York Times, August 19, 1990 Eiseley published works in a number of different genres including poetry, autobiography, history of science, biography, and nonfictional essays. In each piece of writing, he consistently used a poetic writing style. Eiseley's style mirrors what he called the concealed essay‚Äîa piece of writing that unites the personal dimension with more scientific thoughts.Wisner, William. \\"The Perilous Self: Loren Eiseley And The Reticence Of Autobiography.\\" Sewanee Review 113.1, 2005 His writing was unique in that it could convey complex ideas about human origin and the relationship between humans and the natural world to a nonscientific audience. Robert G. Franke describes Eiseley's essays as theatrical and dramatic. He also notes the influence his father's hobby as an amateur Shakespearean actor may have had on Eiseley's writing, pointing out that his essays often contain dramatic elements that are usually present in plays.Franke, Robert. Journal of American Culture. \\"A Great Stage, A Great Play: The Theatrical And Tragic In Loren Eiseley's Essays.\\", 1995 In describing Eiseley's writing, Richard Wentz wrote, \\"As the works of any naturalist might, Eiseley's essays and poems deal with the flora and fauna of North America. They probe the concept of evolution, which consumed so much of his scholarly attention, examining the bones and shards, the arrowpoints and buried treasures. Every scientific observation leads to reflection.\\" In an interview on National Public Radio (NPR), author Michael Lind said, > Before the rise of a self-conscious intelligentsia, most educated people - > as well as the unlettered majority - spent most of their time in the > countryside or, if they lived in cities, were a few blocks away from > farmland or wilderness ...

NPR radio interview, October 17, 2006 =Purposes of his writings= Richard Wentz describes what he feels are the significance and purposes of Eiseley's writings:\\"For Loren Eiseley, writing itself becomes a form of contemplation. Contemplation is a kind of human activity in which the mind, spirit and body are directed in solitude toward some other. Scholars and critics have not yet taken the full measure of contemplation as an art that is related to the purpose of all scholarly activity - to see things as they really are ... Using narrative, parable and exposition, Eiseley has the uncanny ability to make us feel that we are accompanying him on a journey into the very heart of the universe. Whether he is explicating history or commenting on the ideas of a philosopher, a scientist or a theologian, he takes us with him on a personal visit.\\" However, because of Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and his focus on nature and cosmology, he was not accepted or understood by most of his colleagues. \\"You,\\" a friend told him, \\"are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life is never going to be easy for you. You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are not going to like you because you don't stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that's inadvisable.\\" =1950s= ;The Immense Journey (1957) His first book, The Immense Journey, was a collection of writings about the history of humanity, and it proved to be that rare science book that appealed to a mass audience. It has sold over a million copies and has been published in at least 16 languages. Besides being his first book, The Immense Journey was also Eiseley's most well known book and established him as a writer with the ability to combine science and humanity in a poetic way. This book was originally published in 1946. Then, it was published again in 1957, a few years after the Piltdown Man hoax discovery. In the book Eiseley conveys his sense of wonder at the depth of time and the vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, reactions to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In The Immense Journey, Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. Marston Bates writes, > It seems to me ... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed > fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no > present and sure solution. We are not going to find the answers in human > evolution until we have framed the right questions, and the questions are > difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and > culture‚Äîtools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations.Bates, Marston. > \\"Science\\", 1958 Author Orville Prescott wrote, > Consider the case of Loren Eiseley, author of The Immense Journey, who can > sit on a mountain slope beside a prairie-dog town and imagine himself back > in the dawn of the Age of mammals eighty million years ago: 'There by a tree > root I could almost make him out, that shabby little Paleocene rat, eternal > tramp and world wanderer, father of all mankind.' ... his prose is often > lyrically beautiful, something that considerable reading in the works of > anthropologists had not led me to expect. ...

Scientists groped towards a theory with increasingly detailed observations. They became aware that evolution had occurred without knowing how. Evolution was \\"in the air\\" and part of the intellectual discourse both before and after On the Origin of Species was published. The publisher describes it thus: > At the heart of the account is Charles Darwin, but the story neither begins > nor ends with him. Starting with the seventeenth-century notion of the Great > Chain of Being, Dr. Eiseley traces the achievements and discoveries of men > in many fields of science who paved the way for Darwin; and the book > concludes with an extensive discussion of the ways in which Darwin's work > has been challenged, improved upon, and occasionally refuted during the past > hundred years.Darwin's Century, back cover Persons whose contributions are discussed include Sir Thomas Browne, Sir Francis Bacon, Carl Linnaeus, Beno√Æt de Maillet, the Comte de Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, Louis Agassiz, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, James Hutton, William Smith, Georges Cuvier, √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Sir Charles Lyell, Thomas Robert Malthus, William Wells, Patrick Matthew, Karl von Baer, Robert Chambers, Thomas Henry Huxley, Sir John Richardson, Alexander Humboldt, Gregor Mendel, Hugo De Vries, W. L. Johannsen, Lambert Qu√©telet, and Alfred Russel Wallace. Critics discussed include Fleeming Jenkin, A.W. Bennett, Lord Kelvin, and Adam Sedgwick, both a mentor and a critic.Darwin's Century as a whole According to naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts, in the \\"seminal\\" Darwin's Century, Eiseley was studying the history of evolutionary thinking, and he came to see that \\"as a result of scientific studies, nature has become externalized, particularized, mechanized, separated from the human and fragmented, reduced to conflict without consideration of cooperation, confined to reductionist and positivist study.\\" The results for humankind, \\"as part of the 'biota' - Eiseley's concern as a writer - are far reaching.\\" In the book, his unique impact as a thinker and a literary figure emerges as he reexamines science and the way man understands science. She concludes that, for Eiseley, \\"Nature emerges as a metonym for a view of the physical world, of the 'biota,' and of humankind that must be reexamined if life is to survive.\\"Pitts, Mary Ellen. Toward a Dialogue of Understandings: Loren Eiseley and the Critique of Science, Lehigh University Press (1995) In his conclusion, Eiseley quotes Darwin: \\"If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, suffering and famineour slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusementsthey may partake of our origin in one common ancestorwe may be all melted together.\\" Eiseley adds, \\"If he had never conceived of natural selection, if he had never written the Origin, it would still stand as a statement of almost clairvoyant perception.\\"Darwin's Century, page 352. The book won the Phi Beta Kappa prize for best book in science in 1958. =1960s= ;The Firmament of Time (1960) Read excerpts online In discussing The Firmament of Time, Professor of Zoology Leslie Dunn wrote, \\"How can man of 1960, burdened with the knowledge of the world external to him, and with the consciousness that scientific knowledge is attained through continually interfering with nature, 'bear his part' and gain the hope and confidence to live in the new world to which natural science has given birth? ... The answer comes in the eloquent, moving central essay of his new book.\\"Dunn, Leslie C. \\"Natural Law and Science,\\" The New York Times, August 7, 1960 The New Yorker wrote, \\"Dr. Eiseley describes with zest and admiration the giant steps that have led man, in a scant three hundred years, to grasp the nature of his extraordinary past and to substitute a natural world for a world of divine creation and intervention ... An irresistible inducement to partake of the almost forgotten excitements of reflection.\\" A review in The Chicago Tribune added, \\"[This book] has a warm feeling for all natural phenomena; it has a rapport with man and his world and his problems; ... it has hope and belief. And it has the beauty of prose that characterizes Eiseley's philosophical moods.\\" Chicago Sunday Tribune The Firmament of Time was awarded the 1961 John Burroughs Medal for the best publication in the field of Nature Writing. ;The Unexpected Universe (1969) Read excerpts online Poet W.H. Auden wrote, \\"The main theme of The Unexpected Universe is Man as the Quest Hero, the wanderer, the voyager, the seeker after adventure, knowledge, power, meaning, and righteousness.\\"Auden, W.H.Introduction to The Star Thrower He quotes from the book: > Every time we walk along a beach some ancient urge disturbs us so that we > find ourselves shedding shoes and garments or scavenging among seaweed and > whitened timbers like the homesick refugees of a long war ...

The boy who became a famous naturalist was never again to see the spectacle except in his imagination. That childhood event contributed to the profound sense of time and space that marks The Invisible Pyramid. This collection of essays, first published shortly after Americans landed on the moon, explores inner and outer space, the vastness of the cosmos, and the limits of what can be known.

Eiseley credits Blyth with the development of the idea, and even the coining of the words \\"natural selection,\\" which Darwin absorbed and enlarged upon ...

However, she compromised by disassembling them so they couldn't be used. Later, after great effort, his good friend Kenneth Heuer managed to reassemble most of his notebooks into readable form. The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley includes a variety of Eiseley's writings including childhood stories, sketches while he was a vagabond, old family pictures, unpublished poems, portions of unfinished novels, and letters to and from literary admirers like W.H. Auden, Howard Nemerov, Lewis Mumford and Ray Bradbury. In a review of the book, author Robert Finch writes, \\"Like Melville, Eiseley thought of himself, and by extension all mankind, as 'an orphan, a wood child, a changeling,' a cosmic outcast born into a world that afforded him no true home.\\" He adds that his \\"distinctive gift as a writer was to take powerfully formative personal influences of family and place and fuse them with his intellectual meditations on universal topics such as evolution, human consciousness and the weight of time. ... he found metaphors that released a powerful view of man's fate in the modern world.\\" As Kenneth Heuer writes, \\"there are countless examples of Eiseley's empathy with life in all its forms, and particularly with its lost outcasts ... the love that transcends the boundaries of species was the highest spiritual expression he knew.Finch, Robert. New York Times, September 20, 1987 Finch adds, \\"We are grateful for a life and a sensibility that would be welcome in any age, but never more so than in our increasingly depersonalized world. ... he made a generation of readers 'see the world through his eyes.' In an undated passage, circa 1959, Eiseley wrote, 'Man is alone in the universe ... Only in the act of love, in rare and hidden communion with nature, does man escape himself.'\\" The Lost Notebooks contains numerous examples of his \\"creative and sympathetic imagination, even when that creation takes place in the solitude of journals never meant for public eyes.\\" From other reviews: \\"Eiseley has rightly been called 'the modern Thoreau.'\\" ‚ÄìPublishers Weekly; \\"[an] extensive and enlightening glimpses ... into the intellectual and emotional workshop of one of the most original and influential American essayists of this century.\\" ‚ÄìNew York Times Book Review; \\"Eiseley's great genius for the art of the word coupled with a poetic insight into the connection between science and humanism shines through in page after page ...

As an heir of Emerson and Thoreau, he is at home among the poets and philosophers and among those scientists whose observations also were a form of contemplation of the universe.\\" But Wentz considered the inherent contradictions in the statements: \\"We do not really know what to do with religiousness when it expresses itself outside those enclosures which historians and social scientists have carefully labeled religions. What, after all, does it mean to say, \\"the religious chord does not sound in someone,\\" but that the person vibrates to the concerns historically related to religion? If the person vibrates to such concerns, the chord is religious whether or not it manages to resound in the temples and prayer houses of the devout.\\" Wentz quotes Eiseley, from All the Strange Hours and The Star Thrower, to indicate that he was, in fact, a religious thinker: Wentz encompasses such quotes in his partial conclusion: > He was indeed a scientist ‚Äì a bone hunter, he called himself. Archaeologist, > anthropologist and naturalist, he devoted a great deal of time and > reflection to the detective work of scientific observation. However, if we > are to take seriously his essays, we cannot ignore the evidence of his > constant meditation on matters of ultimate order and meaning. Science writer > Connie Barlow says Eiseley wrote eloquent books from a perspective that > today would be called Religious Naturalism. =Evolution= Wentz writes, \\"Loren Eiseley is very much in the tradition of Henry David Thoreau. He takes the circumstances of whatever \\"business\\" he is about as the occasion for new questioning, new searching for some sign, some glimpse into the meaning of the unknown that confronts him at every center of existence.\\" He quotes Eiseley from The Star Thrower, \\"We are, in actuality, students of that greater order known as nature. It is into nature that man vanishes.\\" In comparing Eiseley with Thoreau, he discusses clear similarities in their life and philosophies. He notes that Eiseley was, like Thoreau, a 'spiritual wanderer through the deserts of the modern world.' However, notes Wentz, \\"Thoreau had left the seclusion of Walden Pond in order to pace the fields of history, sorting out the artifacts that people had dropped along the way.\\" But \\"it was those 'fossil thoughts' and 'mindprints' that Eiseley himself explored in his wanderings. These explorations gave depth, a tragic dimension and catharsis to what he called the 'one great drama that concerns us most, the supreme mystery, man.'\\" Eiseley's writing often includes his belief that mankind does not have enough evidence to determine exactly how humans came to be. In The Immense Journey, he writes, \\"... many lines of seeming relatives, rather than merely one, lead to man. It is as though we stood at the heart of a maze and no longer remembered how we had come there.\\" According to Wentz, Eiseley realized that there is nothing below a certain depth that can truly be explained, and quotes Eiseley as saying that there is \\"nothing to explain the necessity of life, nothing to explain the hunger of the elements to become life. ... \\" and that \\"the human version of evolutionary events [is] perhaps too simplistic for belief.\\" =Science and progress= Eiseley talked about the illusions of science in his book, The Firmament of Time: > A scientist writing around the turn of the century remarked that all of the > past generations of men have lived and died in a world of illusion. The > unconscious irony in his observation consists in the fact that this man > assumed the progress of science to have been so great that a clear vision of > the world without illusion was, by his own time, possible. It is needless to > add that he wrote before Einstein ... at a time when Mendel was just about > to be rediscovered, and before the advances in the study of radioactivity > ...Templeton, Robert L. Is God the Only Reality?, Templeton Foundation Press > (1994), quoted by, pg. 144 Wentz noted Eiseley's belief that science may have become misguided in its goals: \\"Loren Eiseley thought that much of the modern scientific enterprise had removed humanity ever farther from its sense of responsibility to the natural world it had left in order to create an artificial world to satisfy its own insatiable appetites.\\" Interpreting Eiseley's messages, he adds, \\"It would be well, he tells us, to heed the message of the Buddha, who knew that 'one cannot proceed upon the path of human transcendence until one has made interiorly in one's soul a road into the future.' Spaces within stretch as far as those without.\\" =Purpose for mankind= \\"In essay after essay,\\" writes Wentz, \\"he writes as a magus, a spiritual master or a shaman who has seen into the very heart of the universe and shares his healing vision with those who live in a world of feeble sight. We must learn to see again, he tells us; we must rediscover the true center of the self in the otherness of nature.\\" Death and burial Loren Eiseley's headstone in West Laurel Hill Cemetery - \\"We loved the earth but could not stay\\" Loren Eiseley died July 9, 1977, of cardiac arrest following surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. He was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Eiseley's wife, Mabel Langdon Eiseley, died July 27, 1986, and is buried next to him, in the Westlawn section of the cemetery, in Lot 366. The inscription on their headstone reads, \\"We loved the earth but could not stay\\", which is a line from his poem The Little Treasures.

It lies within the modern-day London Borough of Southwark, on Borough High Street at the junction with Long Lane, Marshalsea Road, and Tabard Street. St George the Martyr is named after Saint George. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The church has strong associations with Charles Dickens, whose father was imprisoned for debt in the Marshalsea prison. The surviving wall of the prison adjoins the north side of the churchyard. Dickens himself lived nearby, in Lant Street, lodging in a house that belonged to the Vestry Clerk of St George's. This was during the darkest period of his life when, as a teenager, with his father in prison, he had to work in the 'blacking factory', and his literary career must have seemed an impossible dream. Later, he was to set several scenes of the novel Little Dorrit in and around St George's Church. There is a small representation of Little Dorrit in the east window of the church. It is also a recognised church of the City of London Company of Parish Clerks and the guild church of the Guildable Manor. From 2008 the annual Southwark Quit Rents ceremony, before the Queen's Remembrancer has taken place there.  History  Surviving wall of the Marshalsea debtors' prison at the north side of the churchyard. According to traditional hagiography, the saint served as a soldier in the Roman Army and was killed on the orders of the emperor Diocletian in 303 for refusing to persecute Christians and confessing to his own Christianity. The earliest reference to this church is in the Annals of Bermondsey Abbey, which claims that the church was given by Thomas Ardern and Thomas his son in 1122. The date follows the Battle of Acre when the St George myth became adopted by English crusaders; perhaps the church dedication is related to the Arderns' involvement in the Crusade. This gift included tithes from their manor at Horndon in Essex and \\"land of London Bridge returning five solidos\\". This statement means that this St George's is the first and the oldest church with this dedication in the present London area and it predates Edward III's adoption of George as the patron of the Garter by over 200 years. The statement is also the first reference to London Bridge's endowment lands. The present priest was nominated by the City's Bridge House Estates. On Henry V's return from the battle of Agincourt in 1415 he was welcomed by the Aldermen of London on the steps of the church. The 'Agincourt Song' was commissioned as part of the celebration. In this battle the standard with the red cross was used for the first time. In the same year St George became the patron saint of England. The west tower dominates views along Borough High Street from both the north and south due to the curve in the street at this point, where it now meets Great Dover Street. Originally, a much narrower road to the south of the church called Church Street led into Kent Street (now renamed Tabard Street), the historic route to Dover. Due to the volume of traffic, Great Dover Street was cut through parallel to Kent Street as part of the road network enhancements associated with the new Westminster Bridge and London Bridge route improvements, in 1750. Tabard Street was subsequently extended through the churchyard on the north side of the church, leaving the church on an island site. Facade of St George the Martyr church. The present church is believed to be the third on this site. There was a Norman church of unknown appearance, inscribed stones from it were discovered in the second church. This was replaced at the end of the fourteenth century by a church with a bell tower, which may have been from where Antonin de Wyngaerde surveyed at least part of his plan view of London, which includes a drawing of the church, but slightly out of position as might occur if drawn onto the perspective latterly. The church also appears to be that in William Hogarth's engraving of Southwark Fair made in 1733, a year before it was demolished. The church was rebuilt in a Classical style to the designs of John Price between 1734 and 1736, partly funded by ¬£6,000 from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches. The major City Livery Companies and the Bridge House Estates also supported this rebuilding, their arms decorate the nave ceiling and stained glass. In 1899, the crypt was cleared and 1,484 coffins were removed and re- interred at Brookwood Cemetery. The foundations of the south wall were strengthened in 1938 and helped save the building from collapse during the Second World War, when the damage from enemy action was considerable. The red brick and Portland Stone structure of the church has suffered from considerable subsidence damage, and the nave was declared unsafe in 2000, although services continued in other parts of the building. In September 2005, St George the Martyr received funding via the Heritage Lottery Fund for repairs and refurbishments, which involve complete underpinning of the building, and the lowering of the floor levels in the crypt to create additional space. A large number of lead Georgian coffins were removed from the crypt to allow the works to take place. Subsequent archaeological investigations of the ground beneath the church found substantial Medieval and Roman structures. The destruction of some archaeological remains before a fuller excavation could be completed led to controversy. The church was closed for restoration works between September 2005 and March 2007. During this time the congregation worshipped at nearby Guy's Chapel. The new 'crypt', in fact a church hall created by the underpinning works, provides a new conference venue in central London. Services at St George's resumed on Palm Sunday 1 April 2007.  Architecture  The spire of St George the Martyr The church is built of red brick with Portland stone, and has a copper and slate roof. There is a pediment at the west entrance, supported by Ionic columns. The tympanum displays reliefs of angels, and there are eight steps leading up to the entrance. The tower is built of Portland stone, with a large spire. On top of the spire is a ball and weather vane. Inside, the nave has a gallery on three sides, with a pair of fluted Ionic columns supporting the gallery at the west end. On the ceiling is a painting done by Basil Champneys in 1897 of cherubs breaking through a clouded sky, with texts on a ribbon. The coats of arms of four of the City Livery Companies (the Skinners, Grocers, Fishmongers and Drapers) appear on a frieze. The chancel has three bays. There is a tall pulpit on four Ionic columns, and an octagonal font of grey marble. The east window of the church, which includes a kneeling figure of Dickens' Little Dorrit, was designed by Marion Grant. Like St James Garlickhythe in the City of London, St George the Martyr has two reliefs of the Royal Arms. Both are of the House of Stuart. The main one, located on the gallery at the west end, is said to have come from the former church of St Michael Wood Street.

A joggling or jostling board is a long, pliable board that is supported on each end by wooden stands. The board is springy and a person sitting on it can easily bounce up and down. Sources differ on the origination; its usage in the Lowcountry of South Carolina around Charleston in the early 19th century is however rather well-documented. Traditionally, it is painted Charleston green. The joggling board's popularity has slowly been coming back, mostly as decorations on lawns and front porches. Martha Graham bought several joggling boards from Old Charleston Joggling Board Co. on a visit to Charleston and used them as props in her dance Maple Leaf Rag. Photos from the rehearsals show the variety of ways the board was used. The company posed with Graham on these boards for the New York Times. Construction The main board preferably should be between 10 and 16 feet (3 to 5 meters) long and wide enough to sit on. Traditionally the boards were made from the flexible wood of a southern yellow pine tree. The end pieces, which are often shaped similar to a rocking chair to facilitate rocking side to side, hold the main board at sitting height. History According to one South Carolina legend, the first joggling board was built in the early 19th century at Acton Plantation, which was located in the \\"Midlands\\" of South Carolina, near Stateburg in Sumter County; it is maintained that it was constructed with reference to the design of a model shipped to the plantation owner's sister by relatives at the family estate of Gilmerton House in Scotland, and originally developed for exercise purposes.

It was first prepared in 1960 from oripavine, which does not generally occur in opium poppy extract but rather the related plants Papaver orientale and Papaver bracteatum. It was later reproduced in 1963 by a research group at MacFarlan Smith in Gorgie, Edinburgh, led by Kenneth Bentley. It can also be produced from thebaine.  Veterinary use  Etorphine is available legally only for veterinary use and is strictly governed by law. It is often used to immobilize elephants and other large mammals. Diprenorphine (Revivon) is an opioid receptor antagonist that can be administered in proportion to the amount of etorphine used (1.3 times) to reverse its effects. Veterinary-strength etorphine is fatal to humans. For this reason the package as supplied to vets always includes the human antidote as well as etorphine. The human antidote is generally naloxone, not diprenorphine, and is always prepared before the preparation of etorphine to be immediately administered following accidental human exposure to etorphine. The in humans is 30 Œºg which led to the requirement that the medicine include an equal dose of an antidote, diprenorphine or naloxone. One of its main advantages is its speed of operation, and more importantly, the speed that diprenorphine reverses its effects. The high incidence of side effects, including severe cardiopulmonary depression, has caused etorphine to fall into disfavor in general veterinary practice. However, its high potency, combined with the rapid action of both etorphine and its antagonist, diprenorphine, means that it has found a place for use in the capture of large mammals such as rhinoceroses and elephants, where rapid onset and rapid recovery are both very important. The high potency of etorphine means that sufficient etorphine can be administered to large wild mammals by projectile syringe (dart). Large Animal Immobilon is a combination of etorphine plus acepromazine maleate. An etorphine antidote Large Animal Revivon contains mainly diprenorphine for animals and a human-specific naloxone-based antidote, which should be prepared prior to the etorphine. A 5‚Äì15 mg dose is enough to immobilize an African elephant and a 2‚Äì4 mg dose is enough to immobilize a black rhino.  Pharmacology  Etorphine is an extremely potent, non- selective full agonist of the Œº-, Œ¥-, and Œ∫-opioid receptors. It also has relatively weak affinity for the nociceptin receptor. Etorphine has an LD50 of 30 Œºg in humans.  Legal status  In Hong Kong, etorphine is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It can be used legally only by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined $10,000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time. In the Netherlands, etorphine is a Schedule I drug of the Opium Law. It is used only for veterinary purposes in zoos to immobilize large animals. In the US, etorphine is listed as a Schedule I drug with an ACSCN of 9056, although its hydrochloride salt is classified as Schedule II with an ACSCN of 9059. For both, the 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota for both was zero so presumably veterinary supplies of the hydrochloride are imported from Germany and/or the UK. In the UK, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, etorphine is controlled as a Class A substance.

Saint-Henri is usually considered to be bounded to the east by Atwater Avenue, to the west by St-Pierre exchange, to the north by Autoroute 720 and to the south by the Lachine Canal.  Description  Saint-Henri is well known as a historically French-Canadian, Irish and black working class neighbourhood. Often contrasted with wealthy Westmount or NDG looking down over the Falaise Saint-Jacques, in recent years it has been strongly affected by gentrification. The area‚Äîhistorically known as Les Tanneries because of the artisans' shops where leather tanning took place‚Äîwas named for St. Henry via the √âglise Saint-Henri, which at one time formed Place Saint-Henri along with the community's fire and police station. The bustle of a nearby passenger rail station was immortalized in the song \\"Place St. Henri\\" (1964) by Oscar Peterson. Place St. Henri. Retrieved 2015-08-23. Saint-Henri is part of the municipal district of Saint-Henri‚ÄìPetite-Bourgogne‚ÄìPointe- Saint-Charles. The borough hall for Le Sud-Ouest is located in a converted factory in Saint-Henri, bearing witness to the borough's industrial heritage. Also located in the neighbourhood is Solin Hall, a student residence of McGill University. The former chocolate factory is home to nearly 300 students, and is the University's only off-campus residence. There are two metro stations in Saint-Henri; Lionel-Groulx and Place-Saint-Henri.  History  Saint-Henri's Les Tanneries, 1859. √âglise Saint-Henri was so named to commemorate Fr. Henri- Auguste Roux (1798‚Äì1831), the superior of Saint-Sulpice Seminary. The municipality of Saint-Henri was formed in 1875, joining the village of Saint- Henri and the surrounding settlements of Turcot, Brodie, Saint-Agustin and Sainte-Marguerite into one administrative unit.Industrial Architecture of Montreal: Saint-Henri The municipality was incorporated into the City of Montreal in 1905. Well-known people from Saint-Henri include strongman Louis Cyr, who served as a police officer there; the Place des Hommes-Forts and the Parc Louis-Cyr are named for him. Celebrated jazz pianist Oscar Peterson grew up in Little Burgundy which is the neighborhood adjacent to Saint-Henri. Stand-up comedian Yvon Deschamps has described the daily struggle of Saint- Henri's citizens with humorous melancholy. Saint-Henri and Little Burgundy are considered to have a fairly common social makeup. Historically, Saint-Henri was occupied predominantly by French-Canadian blue-collar workers while Little Burgundy was occupied primarily by African-Canadians who worked on the railroads. Today both neighbourhoods have a population of varied ethnicity and social class, especially in the recent housing developments that have sprouted along the Lachine Canal. A great number of teenagers from neighboring districts attend Polyvalente Saint-Henri and James Lyng High School (English Montreal School Board). Many of the district's notable Art deco buildings, including Atwater Market and the historic No. 23 fire hall, were designed by Ludger Lemieux. The neighbourhood is served by the Lionel-Groulx and Place- Saint-Henri Metro stations.  Gentrification  = Introduction = St-Henri is located in Le Sud-Ouest Borough, and became a part of the City of Montreal in 1905. Its proximity to the Lachine Canal shaped the neighborhood with a large industrial working class. Industry lasted from the Canal‚Äôs opening in 1825, until its closure in 1970. Its closure meant the predominantly working class neighborhood began to lose their jobs, creating thousands of unemployed laborers. This deindustrialization rendered the neighborhood the site for gentrification. Sitting on valuable land bordered by the Lachine Canal and both the downtown and Old Montreal, St Henri is primed for redevelopment of old industrial buildings into parks, mixed use developments, condos, shops and restaurants. This transformation began taking form when the Canal was reopened in 2002 with the presence of pedestrian and cyclist paths, bringing more residents and tourists to the area. St Henri is seen as a victim of gentrification, characterized by the arrival of younger wealthy residents and the revitalization of the neighborhood with parks and commercial spaces. Once described as a working class neighborhood with factories, its contemporary form is a ‚Äúlively and surprising borough‚Äù ranked as Montreal‚Äôs second best neighborhood for its livability and atmosphere. = Evidence of gentrification in St. Henri = Changes to the demographic composition of a neighbourhood are an indicator of gentrification. Particularly, increased proportions of college educated residents and residents aged 25 to 34 years old have been found to signal gentrification. This cohort's role in gentrification has been in part attributed to amenities in downtown areas which draw this \\"creative class\\" to neighbourhoods perceived as undervalued. In St. Henri, between 2001 and 2011, the proportion of residents aged 25‚Äì34 rose by seven percentage points : from 20.1% to 27.1%.Ville de Montr√©al. (2014). Montr√©al en statistiques, Division de la planification urbaine, Direction de l‚Äôurbanisme . Profile de quartier : Saint-Henri, arrondissement du Sud-Ouest. By comparison, Montreal‚Äôs share of residents aged 25‚Äì34 only increased from 16.3% to 17.0%. This overrepresentation of the 25-34-year-old age group reflects the gentrification of St. Henri. The progression of neighbourhood residents that are college graduates is less indicative of gentrification than the previous measure. However, during this period, the St. Henri neighbourhood goes from being below the city‚Äôs average to above it with its share of residents having graduated from college increasing from 25.9% in 2001 (26.4% in Montreal) to 43.1% in 2011 (41.5% in Montreal). Gentrification is most often associated with an increase in average neighbourhood income . Contrasting the average household income of St. Henri residents with that of Montreal residents shows that the neighbourhood‚Äôs revenues has comparatively increased. In 2001 the average household income in St.Henri was 29% lower than in Montreal. In 2011, the average income in the neighbourhood decreased to about 17% lower than that of Montreal. The changes in availability of services is also telling of gentrification. From 1996 to 2011 rue Notre-Dame, a street which runs through the whole neighbourhood, has seen a considerable increase in the number of entrepreneurial services such as coffee shops and boutiques accompanied by a smaller increase in the number of corporate chains. Conversely street-level vacant lots on this rue Notre-Dame decreased from 26.2% to 13.5%. = Everyday Politics and Resistance in St. Henri = In St. Henri, up-scale condominiums, boutique shops and other signs of gentrification have displaced, marginalized and stressed those of lower socio-economic status (SES). In response to gentrifying practices, inhabitants within the historically low-income neighborhood have taken up various forms of everyday politics. The power on display in St. Henri can be understood as the increasingly prevalent neo- liberal order, resulting in a free market focus for urban planning initiatives (Rose, 2017). In St. Henri, everyday politics is a mode of resistance to the aforementioned powers by opposing oppressive and unjust treatment from powerful actors and broad social forces. How subordinate inhabitants of St. Henri engage in this resistance can vary from informal behavior to formally organized and confrontational acts, the former being everyday resistance. Through the gentrification of St. Henri, everyday resistance must precede overt forms of resistance, suggesting that the neighborhood has harbored this resistance, leading to more consistent resistance. Gentrification as a physical and social force, allows for everyday resistance to manifest into organized resistance, garnering the attention of media outlets. In 2016, a boutique grocery store known as ‚Äò3734‚Äô was vandalized by masked individuals, displaying anti-capitalist rhetoric and displeasure for the arrival of condos in St. Henri.Shingler.

In St. Henri, as gentrification proliferates, the inhabitants of the neighborhood look toward more organized and targeted political activism to resist the powers of neo-liberal urban planning agendas. Resistance in St.Henri can be seen as collective action and people-led solutions to neighborhood challenges. These solutions call upon formal authorities, resulting in programs affordable housing development initiatives and requirements by the Quebec government.Bemma, Adam. (2012). Montr√©al, tales of gentrification in a bohemian city. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va0JCg0j3fY = Indirect Displacements by Gentrification = Concerning Twigge-Molecey and the St Henri neighbourhood, inhabitants form social ties to others within their same neighbourhood. However, this is particularly true amongst low-income groups, as these people often do not have the opportunity to build a social network outside their living area. In a situation where their houses are repossessed, such people struggle to find new houses within the same neighbourhood and fail to remain socially integrated. As a result, they are forced to live elsewhere, where there is distance between them and their social circle in the previous neighbourhood. This particular scenario embodies a form of social displacement. Moreover, the notion of ‚Äúsense of place‚Äù is threatened by newcomers whose presence would change the character and cultural shape of the place.Lippai, C. (2016). Space, Place and Politics. In Weberman D. & Moroni S. (Eds.), Space and Pluralism: Can Contemporary Cities Be Places of Tolerance? Budapest; New York: Central European University Press, 15-34. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt1d4txn3.5 Regarding gentrification in St Henri, conflicts emerged between lifelong low-income residents and incoming condominium dwellers, the latter denying their belonging to St Henri neighbourhood. Newcomers also display forms of condescension and snobbery that create social separation between inhabitants of the same neighbourhood. Those behaviors underline the shifting of senses of place and highlight a cultural displacement. This type of displacement results ‚Äúwhen the tastes, norms and desires of newcomers supplant and replace those of incumbent residents‚Äù.Richardson, J. Mitchell, B. and Franco, J. (2019). Shifting Neighborhoods: Gentrification And Cultural Displacement In American Cities ¬ª NCRC. NCRC. Retrieved from https://ncrc.org/gentrification/ Finally, the cultural displacement is another indirect consequence caused by gentrification. In 2006 a new IGA supermarket opened in St Henri. As prices are higher to familial small-scale grocery stores located in St Henri, the buying-power of low-income residents has been reduced. Thus, low-income renters feel rejected from the neighbourhood. This feeling is also seen in the new renovated Louis Cyr park in St Henri. Since it has been rebuilt, it became attractive for dog-sitters who could now leave their dogs off leashes. As a result, it discouraged parents from letting their children play in those areas by fear of the aggressive dogs. Overall, it appears that low-income residents suffer more from changes associated with gentrification through socioeconomic and cultural displacements.

In studies of binocular vision the horopter is the locus of points in space that have the same disparity as fixation. This can be defined theoretically as the points in space which project on corresponding points in the two retinas, that is, on anatomically identical points. The horopter can be measured empirically in which it is defined using some criterion. The concept of horopter can then be extended as a geometrical locus of points in space where a specific condition is met: * the binocular horopter is the locus of iso-disparity points in space; * the oculomotor horopter is the locus of iso-vergence points in space. As other quantities that describe the functional principles of the visual system, it is possible to provide a theoretical description of the phenomenon. The measurement with psycho-physical experiments usually provide an empirical definition that slightly deviates from the theoretical one. The underlying theory is that this deviation represents an adaptation of the visual system to the regularities that can be encountered in natural environments.  History of the term  The horopter as a special set of points of single vision was first mentioned in the eleventh century by Ibn al-Haytham, known to the west as \\"Alhazen\\". He built on the binocular vision work of Ptolemy and discovered that objects lying on a horizontal line passing through the fixation point resulted in single images, while objects a reasonable distance from this line resulted in double images. Thus Alhazen noticed the importance of some points in the visual field but did not work out the exact shape of the horopter and used singleness of vision as a criterion. The term horopter was introduced by Franciscus Aguilonius in the second of his six books in optics in 1613. In 1818, Gerhard Vieth argued from Euclidean geometry that the horopter must be a circle passing through the fixation-point and the nodal point of the two eyes. A few years later Johannes M√ºller made a similar conclusion for the horizontal plane containing the fixation point, although he did expect the horopter to be a surface in space (i.e., not restricted to the horizontal plane). The theoretical/geometrical horopter in the horizontal plane became known as the Vieth-M√ºller circle. However, see the next section Theoretical horopter for the claim that this has been the case of a mistaken identity for about 200 years. In 1838, Charles Wheatstone invented the stereoscope, allowing him to explore the empirical horopter. He found that there were many points in space that yielded single vision; this is very different from the theoretical horopter, and subsequent authors have similarly found that the empirical horopter deviates from the form expected on the basis of simple geometry. Recently, plausible explanation has been provided to this deviation, showing that the empirical horopter is adapted to the statistics of retinal disparities normally experienced in natural environments. In this way, the visual system is able to optimize its resources to the stimuli that are more likely to be experienced.  Theoretical Binocular Horopter  Later Hermann von Helmholtz and Ewald Hering worked out the exact shape of the horopter almost at the same time. Their descriptions identified two components for the horopter for symmetrical fixation closer than infinity. The first is in the plane which contains the fixation point (wherever it is) and the two nodal points of the eye. The geometric locus of horopteric points in this plane takes the form of the arc of a circle (the Vieth-M√ºller circle) going from one nodal point to the other in space, passing through the fixation point. The second component is a line (the Pr√©vost‚ÄìBurckhardt line) which is perpendicular to this arc in the median plane, cutting it at the point midway between the two eyes (which may, or may not, be the fixation point). This horopter geometry of a circle in the fixation plane and a perpendicular line remains approximately fixed relative to the eye centers as long as the eyes are fixating somewhere on these two lines. When the eyes are fixated anywhere off these two lines, the theoretical horopter takes the form of a twisted cubic passing through the fixation point and asymptoting to the two lines at their extremes. (Under no conditions does the horopter become either a cylinder through the Vieth-M√ºller circle or a torus centered on the nodal points of the two eyes, as is often popularly assumed.) If the eyes are fixating anywhere at infinity, the Vieth-M√ºller circle has infinite radius and the horopter becomes the two-dimensional plane through the two straight horopter lines. In detail, the identification of the theoretical/geometrical horopter with the Vieth-M√ºller circle is only an approximation. It was pointed out in Gulick and Lawson (1976) that M√ºller's anatomical approximation that the nodal point and eye rotation center are coincident should be refined. Unfortunately, their attempt to correct this assumption was flawed, as demonstrated in Turski (2016). This analysis shows that, for a given fixation point, one has a slightly different horopter circle for each different choice of the nodal point‚Äôs location. Moreover, if one changes the fixation point along a given Vieth-M√ºller circle such that the vergence value remains constant, one obtains an infinite family of such horopters, to the extent that the nodal point deviates from the eye‚Äôs rotation center. These statements follow from the Central Angle Theorem and the fact that three non-collinear points give a unique circle. It can also be shown that, for fixations along a given Vieth-M√ºller circle, all the corresponding horopter circles intersect at the point of symmetric convergence. This result implies that each member of the infinite family of horopters is also composed of a circle in the fixation plane and a perpendicular straight line passing through the point of symmetric convergence (located on the circle) so long as the eyes are in primary or secondary position. When the eyes are in tertiary position away from the two basic horopter lines, the vertical disparities due to the differential magnification of the distance above or below the Vieth- M√ºller circle have to be taken into account, as was calculated by Helmholtz. In this case the horopter becomes a single-loop spiral passing through the fixation point and converging toward the vertical horopter at the top and bottom extremities and passing through the nodal point of the two eyes. This form was predicted by Helmholtz and subsequently confirmed by Solomons. In the general case that includes the fact that the eyes cyclorotate when viewing above or below the primary horopter circle, the theoretical horopter components of the circle and straight line rotate vertically around the axis of the nodal points of the eyes.  Empirical Binocular Horopter  As Wheatstone (1838) observed, the empirical horopter, defined by singleness of vision, is much larger than the theoretical horopter. This was studied by P. L. Panum in 1858. He proposed that any point in one retina might yield singleness of vision with a circular region centred on the corresponding point in the other retina. This has become known as Panum's fusional area, or just Panum's area, although recently that has been taken to mean the area in the horizontal plane, around the Vieth-M√ºller circle, where any point appears single. These early empirical investigations used the criterion of singleness of vision, or absence of diplopia to determine the horopter. Today the horopter is usually defined by the criterion of identical visual directions (similar in principle to the apparent motion horopter, according that identical visual directions cause no apparent motion). Other criteria used over the years include the apparent fronto-parallel plane horopter, the equi- distance horopter, the drop-test horopter or the plumb-line horopter. Although these various horopters are measured using different techniques and have different theoretical motivations, the shape of the horopter remains identical regardless of the criterion used for its determination. Consistently, the shape of the empirical horopter have been found to deviate from the geometrical horopter. For the horizontal horopter this is called the Hering- Hillebrand deviation. The empirical horopter is flatter than predicted from geometry at short fixation distances and becomes convex for farther fixation distances. Moreover the vertical horopter have been consistently found to have a backward tilt of about 2 degrees relative to its predicted orientation (perpendicular to the fixation plane). The theory underlying these deviations is that the binocular visual system is adapted to the irregularities that can be encountered in natural environments.  Horopter in computer vision  In computer vision, the horopter is defined as the curve of points in 3D space having identical coordinates projections with respect to two cameras with the same intrinsic parameters. It is given generally by a twisted cubic, i.e., a curve of the form x = x(Œ∏), y = y(Œ∏), z = z(Œ∏) where x(Œ∏), y(Œ∏), z(Œ∏) are three independent third-degree polynomials. In some degenerate configurations, the horopter reduces to a line plus a circle.

Cooper was described by Thomas Jefferson as \\"one of the ablest men in America\\" and by John Adams as \\"a learned ingenious scientific and talented madcap.\\" Dumas Malone stated that \\"modern scientific progress would have been impossible without the freedom of the mind which he championed throughout life.\\"Quoted in Cohen (2000) His ideas were taken very seriously in his own time: there were substantial reviews of his writings, and some late eighteenth-century critics of materialism directed their arguments against Cooper, rather than against the better-known Joseph Priestley. Early life in Europe Cooper was born in Westminster, England. He attended University College, Oxford, but did not graduate, supposedly refusing the religious test. He then studied law at the Inner Temple, medicine and the natural sciences. He travelled the northern court circuit for a few years; it is unclear in the records whether he practised as a qualified barrister. At the same period he went into the calico printing business at Raikes near Bolton, Lancashire. Cooper took on a prominent role in the reforming politics of the time. In early 1790 he took part in the campaign by Dissenters for greater religious tolerance. His approach was considered too extreme by some, and he shed much moderate support after a meeting in Cheshire. Edmund Burke mentioned Cooper in the House of Commons in March of that year.Graham, p. 150. In October 1790 the Manchester Constitutional Society was set up, with Cooper, author of Letters on the Slave Trade (1787), and other members such as Thomas Walker, noted as radicals and abolitionists. The Constitutional Society had members in common with the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. But in July 1791 the Priestley Riots took place, driving Joseph Priestley from his home. The whole radical group resigned en masse, in 1791, when the Literary and Philosophical Society refused to send Priestley a message of sympathy.Eric Robinson, An English Jacobin: James Watt, Junior, 1769-1848, Cambridge Historical Journal Vol. 11, No. 3 (1955), pp. 349-355, at p. 351. Published by: Cambridge University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3021128 He was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1802. In the rapid developments stemming from the French Revolution, Cooper was sent to Paris in 1792 with James Watt Jr., by the Constitutional Society of Manchester. They travelled with an introduction from Walker to political circles through J√©r√¥me P√©tion de Villeneuve, and another to a man of science, Antoine Lavoisier, from Priestley. Cooper was for some purposes a representative of the British democratic clubs to those of France, but the situation on both sides of the Channel was by now becoming complex. The Manchester group favoured the Jacobins in the emerging split with the Girondins. Edmund Burke again censured Cooper in the House of Commons, and Cooper replied with a vehement pamphlet.Graham, p. 261. Cooper came to represent the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI) alone, in dealings with the Jacobins. The Whig Friends of the People took steps to exclude him, out of concerns that its membership should not overlap with that of the more radical SCI: Burke had called the Manchester reformist group \\"some of the worst men in the kingdom\\" to score a political point off Charles Grey, who had been instrumental in setting up the Friends in April 1792.Graham, p. 303, p. 307 and p. 311. While in France Cooper learned the process of obtaining chlorine from sea salt. He tried to apply this knowledge on his return to England to bleaching of textiles, but was unsuccessful. By 1793, Cooper became disillusioned with the violent course of events in France. Both he and Watt later represented themselves as always favouring moderate elements (which is doubted now by scholars). But Cooper was in some danger of prosecution at home because of his views. He ruled out France as a destination, and made a preliminary journey to the United States in early 1794.Graham, pp. 511‚Äì3. First years in the United States Cooper came to a decision, and emigrated to America with Joseph Priestley later in 1794. He began the practice of law in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. Like his friend Priestley, who was then also living in Northumberland, he sympathized with the Jeffersonian Republicans, and took part in the agitation against the Alien and Sedition Acts. On 26 October 1799, the Reading, Pennsylvania Advertiser published a strong attack he wrote against President John Adams. This led to his being tried for libel under the Sedition Act, and he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, with a fine of $400. It was during this trial that Cooper stated that he knew the king of England could do no wrong, \\"but I did not know till now that the President of the United States had the same attribute.\\"Hoffer (2011) In 1806, Cooper was appointed a land commissioner and succeeded in overcoming the difficulties with the Connecticut claimants in Luzerne county. That year he was also appointed president-judge of the Fourth District of Pennsylvania in 1806. In 1811, having become obnoxious to the members of his own party, he was removed from his position as judge on a charge of arbitrary conduct. Academic leader Thomas Cooper Like Priestley, Cooper was very highly esteemed by Thomas Jefferson, who secured for him the appointment as first professor of natural science and law in the University of Virginia ‚Äî a position which Cooper was forced to resign under the fierce attack made on him by the Virginia clergy. He later served as the chair of chemistry at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania (1811‚Äì1814) and at the University of Pennsylvania (1818‚Äì1819). He became a professor of chemistry at South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) in 1819. Later he would also provide instruction in political economics. In 1820, he became acting president of this institution and was president from 1821 until 1833, when he resigned owing to the opposition within the state to his liberal religious views. In December 1834, owing to continued opposition, he resigned his professorship. Though he became increasingly controversial during his tenure as president, he was very popular with his students. Most of them came to his defense in the years of 1831‚Äì33, when Cooper was frequently challenged by the state legislature. Although many students disagreed with Cooper's philosophies, they liked the man personally. Views on government Upon his arrival in America, Cooper had a positive outlook towards the country saying he preferred America because, \\"There is little fault to find with the government of America, either in principle or in practice‚Ä¶we have no animosities about religion; it is a subject about which no questions are asked‚Ä¶the present irritation of men's minds in Great Britain, and the discordant state of society on political grounds is not known there. The government is the government of the people and for the people\\". By 1831 his perspective had changed: \\"In no other country is the wise toleration established by law, so complete as in this. But in no country whatever is a spirit of persecution for mere opinions, more prevalent than in the United States of America. It is a country most tolerant in theory, and most bigoted in practice\\", not that this made him feel obliged to return to Mother England. He was a born agitator. In 1832, he had been formally tried for infidelity. Before his college classes, in public lectures, and in numerous pamphlets, he constantly preached the doctrine of free trade, and tried to show that the protective system was especially burdensome to the South. His remedy was state action. Each state, he contended, was a sovereign power and was in duty bound to protest against the tyrannical acts of the Federal government. Cooper was a relentless campaigner for political freedom. He believed freedom of speech was the most fundamental of those freedoms and that America had major improvements to make in this area: \\"the value of free discussion is not yet appreciated as it ought to be in these United States\\". He blamed the clergy in particular for this state of affairs: \\"the clergy of this country...are united in persecuting every man who calls in question any of their metaphysical opinions, or who hints at their views of ambition and aggrandizement\\". Not surprisingly, the evangelical Charles Colcock Jones, who was a missionary to slaves as well as a professor at Columbia Theological Seminary, was unimpressed with Cooper. Jones called him \\"the Father\\" of the \\"infidel Party\\" in South Carolina. \\"That old man,\\" he wrote, \\"has done this state more evil than fifty years can remove. He has a world of iniquity to answer for in poisoning the State with his infidel principles.\\"Erskine Clarke, Dwelling Place: A Plantation Epic (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005), 172. Nullification Cooper was at the center of the nullification movement and taught South Carolina about the dangers of consolidation. In 1827, as the tariff controversy grew, Cooper publicly questioned the benefit of the Union. In a speech, he described the South as the perennial loser in an \\"unequal alliance.\\" Cooper predicted that South Carolina would in the near future \\"be compelled to calculate the value of our union.\\" The idea that the South should withdraw \\"received its first extensive advertising as a result of that speech.\\"Malone, Dumas. The Public Life of Thomas Cooper (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1926), pp. 309-310. He exercised considerable influence in preparing the people of South Carolina for nullification and secession; in fact he preceded Calhoun in advocating a practical application of the state sovereignty principle. By nature of being an adamant advocate of states' rights was in favor of Interposition. Cooper was one of the most vocal supporters of secession. Cooper's political views made him enemies, and his religious views made even more. Views on slavery He supported the institution of slavery, although he had strenuously opposed the slave trade. In the mid to late 1780s Cooper fought passionately against \\"that infamous and impolitic traffic\\". He wrote that \\"negroes are men; susceptible of the same cultivation with ourselves\\", claimed that \\"as Englishmen, the blood of the murdered African is upon us, and upon our children, and in some day of retribution he will feel it, who will not assist to wash off the stain\\". But in America Cooper accepted slavery itself, as he doubted that \\"in South Carolina or Georgia...the rich lands could be cultivated without slave labour\\". Philosophy In addition to Thomas Jefferson, he was friends with James Madison and several Governors of South Carolina. As a philosopher he was a follower of David Hartley, Erasmus Darwin, Priestley, and Fran√ßois-Joseph-Victor Broussais; he was a physiological materialist, and a severe critic of Scottish metaphysics. Later years The last years of his life were spent in preparing an edition of the Statutes at Large of the state, which was completed by David James McCord (1797‚Äì1855) and published in ten volumes (1836‚Äì1841). Cooper died in Columbia on the 11th of May 1839. He is interred in the churchyard at Trinity Episcopal Church in Columbia, South Carolina.

Nanyang Siang Pau is one of oldest Chinese-language newspapers in the country, with only Kwong Wah Yit Poh having been published longer. It has been published continuously except for four months in 1923 and 1924 and during the World War II between 1942 and 1945, before publication resumed on 8 September 1945. History Originally started in Singapore, the newspaper first ventured into Kuala Lumpur in 1958, but the newspaper remains printed in Singapore. In 1962, the headquarters of Nanyang Siang Pau moved to Kuala Lumpur, first with Jalan Travers, Brickfields and followed by Jalan Bangsar in 1972. The Singapore edition of the paper has merged with Sin Chew Jit Poh on March 16, 1983 to form the current Lianhe Zaobao, and has since ceased to exist. In August 1932, the Nanyang Daily was separated from Tan's company. The newspaper company name was changed to Nanyang Press in 1975. In 1993, Nanyang Press took over the management of another Chinese daily, China Press and a year later, its office moved to Section 7, Petaling Jaya, its current location. Nanyang had its initial public offering (IPO) in 1989, the first Chinese daily to be listed in Bursa Malaysia. Until the late 1980s, it was Malaysia's highest-selling Chinese newspaper, before being overtaken by Sin Chew Daily, which is also the highest-selling Chinese newspaper outside of Hong Kong, Mainland China and Taiwan. On 28 May 2001, Huaren Holdings, the investment arm of the political party MCA, bought over Nanyang Press, in a controversial transaction that led to mass boycotts of the newspaper by the Chinese community. By June 2005, Nanyang has raised more than RM240 million for Chinese education in Malaysia, through its Top Ten charity concerts in conjunction with Carlsberg Malaysia. in 2006, Huaren Holdings disposed 21.02% of its share to Ezywood Options Sdn Bhd, a company owned by Tan Sri Tiong Hiew King. Huaren's remaining stake were exchanged for a share in Media Chinese International Ltd (MCIL) in 2008, but then disposed of its entire holding in MCIL in 2010.

This use of empirical data is widely seen as opposed to a philosophical methodology that relies mainly on a priori justification, sometimes called \\"armchair\\" philosophy, by experimental philosophers.Knobe, Joshua.

Experimental Philosophy and Philosophical Significance, Philosophical Explorations (10) 2007. Experimental philosophy initially began by focusing on philosophical questions related to intentional action, the putative conflict between free will and determinism, and causal vs. descriptive theories of linguistic reference.Knobe, Joshua. What is Experimental Philosophy? The Philosophers' Magazine (28) 2004. However, experimental philosophy has continued to expand to new areas of research. Disagreement about what experimental philosophy can accomplish is widespread. One claim is that the empirical data gathered by experimental philosophers can have an indirect effect on philosophical questions by allowing for a better understanding of the underlying psychological processes which lead to philosophical intuitions.Knobe, Joshua and Nichols, Shaun. An Experimental Philosophy Manifesto, in Knobe & Nichols (eds.) Experimental Philosophy, ¬ß2.1. 2008. Others claim that experimental philosophers are engaged in conceptual analysis, but taking advantage of the rigor of quantitative research to aid in that project.Lutz, Sebastian. Ideal Language Philosophy and Experiments on Intuitions . Studia Philosophica Estonica 2.2. Special issue: S. H√§ggqvist and D. Cohnitz (eds.), The Role of Intuitions in Philosophical Methodology , pp. 117‚Äì139. 2009 Finally, some work in experimental philosophy can be seen as undercutting the traditional methods and presuppositions of analytic philosophy.Machery, Edouard. What are Experimental Philosophers Doing? . Experimental Philosophy (blog) , July 30, 2007. Several philosophers have offered criticisms of experimental philosophy. History Though, in early modern philosophy, natural philosophy was sometimes referred to as \\"experimental philosophy\\", the field associated with the current sense of the term dates its origins around 2000 when a small number of students experimented with the idea of fusing philosophy to the experimental rigor of psychology. While the philosophical movement Experimental Philosophy began around 2000 (though perhaps the earliest example of the approach is reported by Hewson, 1994Hewson, C. (1994). Empirical Evidence Regarding the Folk Psychological Concept of Belief. Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, 403-408. Hillsdale, New Jersey. (Atlanta, Georgia).), the use of empirical methods in philosophy far predates the emergence of the recent academic field. Current experimental philosophers claim that the movement is actually a return to the methodology used by many ancient philosophers. Further, other philosophers like David Hume, Ren√© Descartes and John Locke are often held up as early models of philosophers who appealed to empirical methodology.Peter Anstey, \\"Is x-phi old hat?\\", Early Modern Experimental Philosophy Blog, 30 August 2010. Areas of research =Consciousness= The questions of what consciousness is, and what conditions are necessary for conscious thought have been the topic of a long- standing philosophical debate. Experimental philosophers have approached this question by trying to get a better grasp on how exactly people ordinarily understand consciousness. For instance, work by Joshua Knobe and Jesse Prinz (2008) suggests that people may have two different ways of understanding minds generally, and Justin Sytsma and Edouard Machery (2009) have written about the proper methodology for studying folk intuitions about consciousness. Bryce Huebner, Michael Bruno, and Hagop Sarkissian (2010) have further argued that the way Westerners understand consciousness differs systematically from the way that East Asians understand consciousness, while Adam Arico (2010) has offered some evidence for thinking that ordinary ascriptions of consciousness are sensitive to framing effects (such as the presence or absence of contextual information). Some of this work has been featured in the Online Consciousness Conference. Other experimental philosophers have approached the topic of consciousness by trying to uncover the cognitive processes that guide everyday attributions of conscious states. Adam Arico, Brian Fiala, Rob Goldberg, and Shaun Nichols,Arico, A., Fiala, B., Goldberg, R., and Nichols, S. forthcoming. Mind & Language. for instance, propose a cognitive model of mental state attribution (the AGENCY model), whereby an entity's displaying certain relatively simple features (e.g., eyes, distinctive motions, interactive behavior) triggers a disposition to attribute conscious states to that entity. Additionally, Bryce Huebner has argued that ascriptions of mental states rely on two divergent strategies: one sensitive to considerations of an entity's behavior being goal-directed; the other sensitive to considerations of personhood. =Cultural diversity= Following the work of Richard Nisbett, which showed that there were differences in a wide range of cognitive tasks between Westerners and East Asians, Jonathan Weinberg, Shaun Nichols and Stephen Stich (2001) compared epistemic intuitions of Western college students and East Asian college students. The students were presented with a number of cases, including some Gettier cases, and asked to judge whether a person in the case really knew some fact or merely believed it. They found that the East Asian subjects were more likely to judge that the subjects really knew.Weinberg, J., Nichols, S., & Stich, S. (2001). Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions. Philosophical Topics 29, pp. 429‚Äì460. Later Edouard Machery, Ron Mallon, Nichols and Stich performed a similar experiment concerning intuitions about the reference of proper names, using cases from Saul Kripke's Naming and Necessity (1980). Again, they found significant cultural differences. Each group of authors argued that these cultural variances undermined the philosophical project of using intuitions to create theories of knowledge or reference. However, subsequent studies have consistently failed to replicate Weinberg et al.'s (2001) results for other Gettier cases Kim, M., & Yuan, Y. (2015). No cross-cultural differences in the Gettier car case intuition: A replication study of Weinberg et al. 2001. Episteme, 12(03), 355-361. Seyedsayamdost, H. (2015). On normativity and epistemic intuitions: Failure of replication. Episteme, 12(01), 95-116. Indeed, more recent studies have actually been providing evidence for the opposite hypothesis, that people from a variety of different cultures have surprisingly similar intuitions in these cases. =Determinism and moral responsibility= One area of philosophical inquiry has been concerned with whether or not a person can be morally responsible if their actions are entirely determined, e.g., by the laws of Newtonian physics. One side of the debate, the proponents of which are called ‚Äòincompatibilists,‚Äô argue that there is no way for people to be morally responsible for immoral acts if they could not have done otherwise. The other side of the debate argues instead that people can be morally responsible for their immoral actions even when they could not have done otherwise. People who hold this view are often referred to as ‚Äòcompatibilists.‚Äô It was generally claimed that non-philosophers were naturally incompatibilist,Nahmias, E., Morris, S., Nadelhoffer, T. & Turner, J. Surveying Freedom: Folk Intuitions about Free Will and Moral Responsibility . Philosophical Psychology (18) 2005 p.563 that is they think that if you couldn't have done anything else, then you are not morally responsible for your action. Experimental philosophers have addressed this question by presenting people with hypothetical situations in which it is clear that a person's actions are completely determined. Then the person does something morally wrong, and people are asked if that person is morally responsible for what she or he did. Using this technique Nichols and Knobe (2007) found that \\"people's responses to questions about moral responsibility can vary dramatically depending on the way in which the question is formulated\\" (PDF p.2) and argue that \\"people tend to have compatiblist intuitions when they think about the problem in a more concrete, emotional way but that they tend to have incompatiblist intuitions when they think about the problem in a more abstract, cognitive way\\". (¬ßPapers on Experimental Philosophy and Metaphilosophy) =Epistemology= Recent work in experimental epistemology has tested the apparently empirical claims of various epistemological views. For example, research on epistemic contextualism has proceeded by conducting experiments in which ordinary people are presented with vignettes that involve a knowledge ascription.Phelan, M. Evidence that Stakes Don't Matter for Evidence Feltz, A. & Zarpentine, C. Do You Know More When It Matters Less? Philosophical Psychology. Participants are then asked to report on the status of that knowledge ascription. The studies address contextualism by varying the context of the knowledge ascription (for example, how important it is that the agent in the vignette has accurate knowledge). Data gathered thus far show no support for what contextualism says about ordinary use of the term \\"knows\\". Other work in experimental epistemology includes, among other things, the examination of moral valence on knowledge attributions (the so-called \\"epistemic side-effect effect\\"),Beebe, J. & Buckwalter, W. The Epistemic Side-Effect Effect Mind & Language. of the knowing-that / knowing-how distinction, and of laypeople's intuitions about lying, improper assertion, and insincerity. =Intentional action= A prominent topic in experimental philosophy is intentional action. Work by Joshua Knobe has especially been influential. \\"The Knobe Effect\\", as it is often called, concerns an asymmetry in our judgments of whether an agent intentionally performed an action. Knobe (2003a) asked people to suppose that the CEO of a corporation is presented with a proposal that would, as a side effect, affect the environment. In one version of the scenario, the effect on the environment will be negative (it will \\"harm\\" it), while in another version the effect on the environment will be positive (it will \\"help\\" it). In both cases, the CEO opts to pursue the policy and the effect does occur (the environment is harmed or helped by the policy). However, the CEO only adopts the program because he wants to raise profits; he does not care about the effect that the action will have on the environment. Although all features of the scenarios are held constant‚Äîexcept for whether the side effect on the environment will be positive or negative‚Äîa majority of people judge that the CEO intentionally hurt the environment in the one case, but did not intentionally help it in the other. Knobe ultimately argues that the effect is a reflection of a feature of the speakers' underlying concept of intentional action: broadly moral considerations affect whether we judge that an action is performed intentionally. However, his exact views have changed in response to further research. =Predicting philosophical disagreement= Research suggests that some fundamental philosophical intuitions are related to stable individual differences in personality. Although there are notable limits,Doris, J. (2005). Lack of Character. New York: Oxford University Press. philosophical intuitions and disagreements can be predicted by heritable Big Five personality traits and their facets. Extraverts are much more likely to be compatibilists, particularly if they are high in ‚Äúwarmth.‚Äù Extraverts show larger biases and different patterns of beliefs in the Knobe side effect cases. Neuroticism is related to susceptibility to manipulation-style free will arguments. Emotional Stability predicts who will attribute virtues to others.Feltz. A., & Cokely, E.T. (in press). Virtue or consequences: The folk against Pure Evaluational Internalism. Philosophical Psychology.Feltz, A., & Cokely, E.T. (2012). The virtues of ignorance. The Review of Philosophy and Psychology, 3, 335-350. Openness to experience predicts non-objectivist moral intuitions.Feltz, A., & Cokely, E. T. (2008). The fragmented folk: More evidence of stable individual differences in moral judgments and folk intuitions. In B. C. Love, K. McRae & V. M. Sloutsky (Eds.), Proceedings of the 30th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 1771-1776). Austin, TX: Cognitive Science Society. The link between personality and philosophical intuitions is independent of cognitive abilities, training, education, and expertise. Similar effects have also been found cross- culturally and in different languages including German and Spanish. Because the Big Five Personality Traits are highly heritable, some have argued that many contemporary philosophical disputes are likely to persist through the generations. This may mean that some historical philosophical disputes are unlikely to be solved by purely rational, traditional philosophical methods and may require empirical data and experimental philosophy. Criticisms In 2006, J. David Velleman attacked experimental philosophy on the blog Left2Right, prompting a response from its defenders on Brian Leiter's blog. Antti Kauppinen (2007) has argued that intuitions will not reflect the content of folk concepts unless they are intuitions of competent concept users who reflect in ideal circumstances and whose judgments reflect the semantics of their concepts rather than pragmatic considerations. Experimental philosophers are aware of these concerns,Sinnott-Armstrong, W. Abstract + Concrete = Paradox , 'in Knobe & Nichols (eds.) Experimental Philosophy, (209-230), 2008. and acknowledge that they constitute a criticism. Timothy Williamson (2008) has argued that we should not construe philosophical evidence as consisting of intuitions. Other experimental philosophers have noted that experimental philosophy often fails to meet basic standards of experimental social science. A great deal of the experiments fail to include enough female participants. Analysis of experimental data is often plagued by improper use of statistics, and reliance on data mining. Others have pointed out that many participants in experimental philosophy studies fail to comprehend the often abstract and complicated materials, and few studies report comprehension checks. Holtzman argues that a number of experimental philosophers are guilty of suppressing evidence. Yet, in lumping together all people's intuitions as those of the 'folk,' critics may be ignoring basic concerns identified by standpoint feminists. Some research in experimental philosophy is misleading because it examines averaged responses to surveys even though in almost all of the studies in experimental philosophy there have been substantial dissenting minorities. Ignoring individual differences may result in a distorted view of folk intuitions or concepts. This may lead to theoretical and strange fictions about everyday intuitions or concepts that experimental philosophy was designed to avoid akin to creating the fiction that the average human is not a man or a woman, but the average of a man and woman (e.g., the average person has one ovary and one testicle).Feltz, A., & Cokely, E.T., (in press). Predicting philosophical disagreement. Philosophy Compass. This criticism is not unique to experimental philosophy but also applies to other sciences such as psychology and chemistry, although experimental philosophers may lack the training to recognize it. = Problem of reproducibility = In a series of studies published in 2012 and later peer-reviewed, Hamid Seyedsayamdost showed that some of the most famous results in experimental philosophy were not reproducible. This work gave rise to a focused attention on reproducibility in experimental philosophy. Several philosophers have carried out independent replications and to date all have confirmed Seyedsayamdost's results. Some of the areas covered in this debate include the instability and malleability of philosophical intuitions, determinism and moral responsibility, cultural diversity, gender differences and socioeconomic diversity. A large amount of research also focused on epistemology as Stephen Stich argued early on that findings reported by him and co-authors suggested that long practiced methods in philosophy had to be discarded, famously noting that in light of their findings a \\"reasonable conclusion is that philosophy's 2400 year long infatuation with Plato's method has been a terrible mistake.\\" Since publication of Seyedsayamdost's papers, Stich and collaborators have reversed their research direction on this question. The reason for these problems in experimental philosophy is not entirely clear, although a parallel with experimental psychology has been suggested. At least one recent study, in which a team attempted to replicate various influential studies in experimental philosophy studies, found that roughly 70% of them could be replicated. The reasons for the discrepancy with Seyedsayamdost's original study are not yet known. References Further reading * Buckwalter, W.

It was divided in four sections and its principal objectives were to create an Asturian dictionary and grammar and to publish a magazine. Other sections were dedicated to promoting Asturian literature, theatre and music. But it was from 1980 when the Asturian pre-autonomous government, the Consejo Regional, approved the creation of the ALLA, founded 15 December of the same year. Xos√© Lluis Garc√≠a Arias was its first president from that moment until 2001 when Ana Cano took over from him. Works In 1981 the Normes Ortogr√°fiques y Conxugaci√≥n de Verbos (Orthographic Norms and Verb Conjugation), the first academic work, was published.

This riding was created in 1966 from parts of Burnaby‚ÄîCoquitlam, Burnaby‚ÄîRichmond and Coast‚ÄîCapilano ridings. The riding originally consisted of the eastern part of North Vancouver plus areas of Burnaby north of the Grandview Highway and Edmonds Avenue, west of Sperling and north of Pandora Street. That is, North Vancouver east of Lynn Creek plus the Burnaby Heights, Capitol Hill, Brentwood and Deer Lake neighbourhoods of Burnaby. The riding's first election in 1968, is notable for being a showdown between the former leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party, Ray Perrault, and federal New Democratic Party leader Tommy Douglas. Given that the North Shore portions of the riding were largely affluent and upper middle class in character and normally a Liberal bastion, Douglas' strong showing is not so surprising given the working-class and labour background of much of even the better-off parts of the riding in Burnaby. When this riding was redistributed in 1976, the resulting Burnaby riding consistently returned NDP candidates - this was Svend Robinson's longtime seat. North Vancouver‚ÄîBurnaby returned a Progressive Conservative member (Chuck Cook) since its creation until it was abolished in 1987, as did its successor riding, the seat of North Vancouver until Reform Party member Ted White took over the seat on Cook's retirement. In provincial politics, the equivalent area of North Vancouver was among the last holdouts of the provincial Liberal Party prior to it losing its support base to the Social Credit Party in the early 1980s. Jim Nielsen, who first unsuccessfully ran for the Progressive Conservative Party in Burnaby‚ÄîSeymour in 1974 was subsequently elected in the 1975 provincial election as the MLA for Richmond. He was appointed as a cabinet minister and remained the MLA for Richmond until his resignation from provincial politics in 1986.

The club was founded on April 5, 1956 and originally played at the Vitorino Gon√ßalves Dias stadium. Their current stadium, the Est√°dio do Caf√© was built for Londrina's participation in the 1976 Brazilian league championship. The most successful period for Londrina came between 1976 and 1982 when Londrina competed in Brazil's top league for 6 seasons. They were relegated for the 1980 season but claimed their only national league title by becoming champions of the second division. They have also won the state championship four times, as well as claiming 12 Campeonato do Interior Paranaense titles. In 2013, Londrina finished in top place in the general classification of the Campeonato Paranaense. Although they did not qualify for the state championship final they won the Interior final and thereby qualified for a place in the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie D, the fourth tier of the Brazilian league system and will also be placed in the draw for the First Round of the Copa do Brasil. History Londrina was founded by a group of sportsmen who, after watching a friendly match between Nacional and Vasco da Gama in Rol√¢ndia, decided that they did not want to go to Rol√¢ndia to watch football. Instead, they founded a club in Londrina, their own city. The club, named Londrina Futebol e Regatas, was founded on April 5, 1956. They chose blue and white to be Londrina's colors. In 1969, Londrina Futebol e Regatas merged with Paran√° Esporte Clube, founded in 1942, forming Londrina Esporte Clube. Red and white, the colors for the city of Londrina, became the new club's colors. In 1972, Carlos Ant√¥nio Franchello returned to the presidency of the club, and restored blue and white as the club's colors. In 2008, Londrina won the Copa Paran√° for the first time, after beating Cianorte in the final. The club also competed in the same season's Recopa Sul-Brasileira. Londrina was eliminated in the Recopa Sul- Brasileira in the semifinals after a penalty shootout, by Brusque.

The ship was lost at sea after leaving Liverpool on February 11, 1893 bound for New York, with the loss of all 74 people on board. The ship's fate is a mystery that remains unsolved to this day.  History  Naronic was launched on May 26, 1892, completed on 11 July 1892 and departed for her maiden voyage on 15 July 1892, sailing from Liverpool to New York. The 470 ft, twin screw steamship was designed as a freighter with the addition of limited passenger quarters to handle the increased traffic that White Star was experiencing on its non-New York routes. After her first run, Naronic made five more sailings without incident, before departing on what was to be her final voyage on February 11, 1893 under the command of Captain William Roberts.  Disappearance  For this voyage to New York, Naronic had a crew of 50, plus 24 cattlemen to attend to the ship's primary cargo, livestock. After leaving Liverpool, she stopped briefly at Point Lynas, Anglesey, North Wales, to put her pilot ashore before heading west into heavy seas, never to be seen again. Naronic had no wireless telegraph with which to send a distress call (it would be another five years before the Marconi Company opened their factory that produced the system the RMS Titanic used to send her distress signals), so whatever problem she encountered, her crew was on their own. The only knowledge we have of the incident comes from two sources. The British steamer SS Coventry reported seeing two of Naronic's empty lifeboats; the first lifeboat, found at 2:00 am on 4 March, was capsized and the second, found at 2:00 pm, was swamped. The first of these was found 19 miles (some sources put this at 90 miles) from the site where the White Star Line's Titanic would later meet a similar fate. The second source of information are four bottles with messages inside, which were recovered later, that claimed to have been written while Naronic was sinking. Two of the bottles were found in the United States, one on March 3 in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York, and one in Ocean View, Virginia, on March 30. A third bottle was found in June 1893 in the Irish Channel, and the fourth was found on September 18 in the River Mersey near the ship's point of departure, Liverpool. While all four specifically mention Naronic sinking, the second bottle found contained the most detailed message: It was signed \\"John Olsen, Cattleman\\"; however, there was no one with this name listed on the ship's manifest, the closest being John O'Hara and John Watson. A similar situation exists with the first bottle found, in that the signature, \\"L. Winsel\\", is also not on the manifest. The messages in the other two bottles are unsigned. Because of this, the reliability of the bottles as genuine testaments to the ship's fate has been questioned and the Court of Inquiry into the incident did not accept the bottled notes as genuine. If the messages were legitimate, the ship sank sometime after 3:20 a.m on February 19, 1893.

The RSC was a feature- reduced single-chip implementation of the POWER1, a multi-chip central processing unit (CPU) which implemented the POWER instruction set architecture (ISA). It was used in entry-level workstation models of the IBM RS/6000 family, such as the Model 220 and 230. Logic schematic of the RSC chip The RSC operated at frequencies of 33 and 45 MHz. It has three execution units: a fixed point unit, floating point unit and branch processor; and an 8 KB unified instruction and data cache. Like the POWER1, the memory controller and I/O was tightly integrated, with the functional units responsible for the functions: a memory interface unit and sequencer unit; residing on the same die as the processor. The RSC contains nine functional units: fixed-point execution unit (FXU), floating-point execution unit (FPU), the memory management unit (MMU), memory interface unit (MIU), sequencer unit, common on- chip processor unit (COP), instruction fetch unit, and instruction queue and dispatch unit. The fixed point unit executes integer instructions, generates addresses in load store operations and some portions of branch instructions. It has a three-stage pipeline consisting of decode, execute and writeback stages. Some instructions require several cycles in the execute stage before they are completed. The floating point unit executes floating point instructions. Unlike the POWER1, the RSC does not have register renaming capability due to a limited die area in which the unit must fit in. To further save die area, the floating point multiply-add array is 32 bits wide. To perform 64-bit (double-precision) operations, the operands are broken into two, and the instruction passes twice through the multiply-add array. The floating point pipeline consists of four stages, decode, multiply, add and writeback. The RSC has an 8 KB unified cache instead of the separate instruction and large data caches like the POWER1. The unified cache is two- way set associative and uses a store-through policy with no reload on a store miss and a least recently used (LRU) replacement policy. It has a cache line size of 64 bytes, and each cache line is sectored into four quadwords (16 bytes), with each quadword given its own valid bit in the cache directory. During each cycle, four words can be read from it and two doublewords can be written to it. The memory data bus is 72 bits wide, with a 64 bits used for the data path and 8 bits used for error correcting code (ECC). The memory interface unit manages the bus and performs ECC checks on data coming into the processor. The ECC logic is capable of correcting single-bit errors. Compared to the POWER1, the RSC memory data bus is narrower and uses industry standard SIMMs instead of custom memory cards. The RSC contained approximately one million transistors on a 14.9 mm by 15.2 mm (226.48 mm2) die fabricated by IBM in a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process with a minimal feature size of 0.8 Œºm and three levels of wiring. It is packaged in a 36 mm by 36 mm ceramic pin grid array module which had 201 signal pins. It required a 3.6 volt power supply and consumed 4 watts during operation at 33 MHz.

She is best known as a correspondent and co-host for Entertainment Tonight (1984‚Äì2000) as well as for having her own syndicated daytime talk show, Leeza (1993‚Äì2000). In 2013, her book Take 2 became a New York Times bestseller and she won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Host in a Lifestyle or Travel program for the PBS show, My Generation. On February 16, 2015, Leeza was named the winner of Celebrity Apprentice, having raised $714,000 for her charity Leeza's Care Connection.Leeza's Care Connection Biography =Early life= Gibbons was born in Hartsville, South Carolina, the daughter of Jean and Carlos Gibbons, a former state superintendent of education and antique shop owner. Gibbons has two siblings ‚Äì a brother, Carlos Jr., and a sister, Cammy. Leeza and her family also adopted a young chimpanzee from a traveling circus they named Martha. When Martha was older, it became difficult to manage her care and she was sent to a Great Ape sanctuary in Florida, where she still lives to this day. Gibbons grew up in Columbia, South Carolina in a housing subdivision called Whitehall, and graduated from Irmo High School. After completing high school, Gibbons graduated summa cum laude from the University of South Carolina's school of journalism and mass communication, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. =Career= Leeza Gibbons‚Äôs television career started in her home state of South Carolina, at WSPA-TV in Spartanburg. Her next stop was as the co host of PM Magazine for KFDM-TV in Beaumont, Texas, and later moved up to then-sister station WFAA-TV in Dallas. In 1983 Gibbons joined WCBS-TV in New York City, where she became a host on Two on the Town, a program modeled after PM Magazine; her co-host was Robb Weller. The following year, they would both join Entertainment Tonight, with Gibbons as a reporter and co-anchor of the program's weekend edition. Concurrently hosted, Leeza was her own NBC/syndicated talk show, which ran from June 1993 to September 2000. The show originated as John & Leeza from Hollywood, a talk show with former Entertainment Tonight co-host John Tesh. Tesh was dropped from the show after seven months, and Gibbons hosted solo for the remainder of the series. From 2001‚Äì2003, Gibbons was the host and managing editor of the television show Extra. In 2011, she pulled down double duty (again) as the host of the PBS show My Generation (2011‚Äì2014) and as co-host and executive producer of the syndicated news magazine show America Now (2011‚Äì2015). In addition to her television and radio career, Gibbons has received the Congressional Horizon Award for her work on children's issues. In the 1990s, Gibbons hosted the radio countdown show Blockbuster Top 25 Countdown with Leeza Gibbons. The show was created for Adult Contemporary and Hot Adult Contemporary formats. Gibbons counted down the hits in the respective formats and included entertainment news and pre-recorded interviews. When Blockbuster Video stopped sponsoring the program in 1999, the show's name was changed to Leeza Gibbons' Top 25 Countdown. The Adult Contemporary version was cut to a top 20. In January 2001, the countdown aspect of the show was dropped and was renamed Leeza Gibbons' Hollywood Confidential, which focused more on entertainment news. The change in format brought new life to the show, as the show continued on for another 12 years (ending in 2013). In the early to mid-1990s, Gibbons partnered with Guthy Renker and became a trailblazer in the world of direct response. She was the first television star on a daily show to be featured in an infomercial as she starred in back-to-back blockbusters (Personal Power 2 and Get the Edge) with a young Tony Robbins. In early 2000s, Gibbons launched her mineral makeup line, Sheer Cover Studio, with Guthy- Renker. Gibbons said, \\"Sheer Cover is not just a makeup product, it's a transformative experience for women who have serious skin issues like sun damage, birth marks, scars and acne or just for any woman who wants natural looking skin that glows with a healthy radiance.\\" Presently, Sheer Cover continues to be sold around the world. In 2015, Gibbons received the Icon award from the Electronic Retailing Association, where it was announced that Gibbons had crossed the $1 billion mark in sales. Her partnership with Guthy- Renker is the longest studio/talent relationship in infomercial history. In 2016, Gibbons and Guthy-Renker launched their latest infomercial together, Dr Denese Skinscience. On November 14, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced the appointment of Gibbons to the board that oversees California's stem cell research agency. Gibbons fills a slot designated for a patient advocate for Alzheimer's as the result of her nonprofit group, Leeza's Place, which is aimed at caregivers for persons with memory disorders. Gibbons' efforts with memory disorders grew out of her own family's experience with her mother who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and died in May 2008. Gibbons replaced Meredith Vieira for a week of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire shows on June 23‚Äì27, 2008. In May 2009 Gibbons' new book, Take Your Oxygen First: Protecting Your Health and Happiness While Caring for a Loved One with Memory Loss, tells the story of Leeza's family's personal struggle with Alzheimer's disease after her mother's diagnosis. She provides practical advice on how caregivers and their families can (and must) take care of their own physical, emotional and spiritual needs in order to give better care to their loved ones who may be suffering with a memory loss disorder. In 2013, Gibbons won her first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lifestyle/Travel Host for the PBS series My Generation. In 2015, she won the NBC reality game-show series Celebrity Apprentice, beating out TV news personality Geraldo Rivera. She became the second female winner of the show, after Joan Rivers. She began co-hosting the Rose Parade on January 2, 2017. =Personal life= Gibbons has been married four times; she was married to John Hicks from 1980 to 1982. From 1989 to 1991, she was married to British actor Christopher Quinten, who she met when they both featured in the 1988 New Zealand Telethon, and with whom she has a daughter, Jordan Alexandra (Lexi) Gibbons. She was married to actor Stephen Meadows from 1991 to 2005, and they had two sons, Troy and Nathan Daniel. In 2011, she married New York Times best selling author, Steven Fenton, in Beverly Hills.Jordan, Julie. \\"Leeza Gibbons Gets Married\\". People. April 22, 2011.

Land acquisition continued through 1999 when the legislature funded $3.7 million to create the park. Indiana Governor Joe Kernan formally dedicated the park in 2004. The campground opened the following year and was a partnership with Lafayette as part of the Lafayette Inn tax proceeds.

The classic Four'n Twenty pie is filled with mutton and beef (a minimum of 25%, per Food Standards Australia New Zealand regulations), mostly shoulder meat, in a spiced gravy with carrot and onion. The crust is a flour and margarine shortcrust pastry, with the upper crust additionally rolled and folded to make it slightly flaky. Other fillings include chicken and vegetable, pulled pork, and grass-fed Angus beef. Australians have the highest per-capita meat pie consumption in the world, and Four'n Twenty pies are considered iconic, particularly in the context of football matches. They are often served with tomato sauce. The brand's name is a reference to the nursery rhyme Sing a Song of Sixpence, which includes the lines \\"Four and twenty blackbirds / Baked in a pie\\". Some early logos alluded to this, with 24 blackbirds escaping from a pie and taking flight, although the current logo features only text. History The Four'n Twenty pie was created in Bendigo, Victoria, Australia by Leslie Thompson McClure in 1947. Initially called the Dad & Dave Pie after the name of his cafe, McClure renamed the pie using the nursery rhyme suggestion from an employee. At that time, production was around 50 pies per day. McClure took a sampling of his pies to the Royal Melbourne Agricultural Show, where they proved very popular. Increasing demand for the pie caused McClure to open a bakery in a pavilion of the showgrounds in 1949, then a factory in nearby Union Road, Ascot Vale in 1953, and eventually a larger factory in Kensington. In 1960, McClure sold his stake in Four'n Twenty to the Victorian arm of Peters Ice Cream. Peters' subsequent owner, Pacific Dunlop, sold the brand to Simplot in 1995, and Simplot in turn sold Four'n Twenty and several other bakery brands to Patties Foods in 2003. Patties expanded their Bairnsdale manufacturing facility and consolidated Four'n Twenty production into it, closing the Kensington plant. The new plant can produce 21,000 pies per hour, 24 hours per day. In 2006, the brand announced that the Four'n Twenty pie would be sold on the American market. In 2017, to celebrate Four'n Twenty's 70th anniversary, the brand launched the Four'n Twenty Cheese and Vegemite Pie. Later in 2017, Four'n Twenty launched the Topper, a crispy breaded pocket with lasagna, macaroni and cheese, or chicken cordon bleu fillings. On April 21st 2019, Four'N Twenty launched its brand of meat pies in Japan, with a Four‚ÄôN Twenty Day celebration at the World Beer Museum in Tokyo. In 2020, Four'n Twenty introduced a Vegan friendly meat-free pie to the market, said to have the same \\"taste, texture and flavour\\" as the original.

Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (p. 15) It is the only Christie first edition published in the UK that contains stories with both Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, the writer's two most famous detectives. It retailed in the UK for twelve shillings and sixpence (12/6) and comprises six cases. It was not published in the US although the stories it contains were published in other volumes there. Plot summaries =The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding= Poirot is asked by a Mr Jesmond, who is acting as an intermediary to an eastern prince, to help that unfortunate young man with a problem he is having. The prince is due soon to be married to a cousin. On his way to be married, he met an attractive but obviously dubious young woman, and rashly decided to have a last fling with her. The prince brought several expensive jewels with him to London for resetting by Cartier and one of them, a fabulous ruby, was stolen by the young woman. If it cannot be retrieved, a scandal will ensue and because of this, the police cannot be involved. The mystery can be solved at an old English country house called Kings Lacey where it will be arranged for Poirot to join a family there for their Christmas celebrations, supposedly to experience a typical English Christmas. On Christmas Eve, at Kings Lacey, Poirot is told about the other members of their party by Mrs Lacey, his elderly host in the house. Joining them will be her husband, Colonel Lacey; Sarah, a granddaughter by their deceased son; Colin, a teenage grandson by their daughter; Michael, a friend of Colin's at school; Bridget who is of the same age as Colin and Michael and is a great niece of Mrs Lacey's; Diana, a young cousin of Mrs Lacey's; and David Welwyn who is a family friend. Colonel and Mrs Lacey are perturbed by Sarah's relationship with a young rake called Desmond Lee-Wortley. They both think him unsuitable for their granddaughter and have invited him to join them for Christmas, in the hope that a few days' close contact with Sarah will show her how unsuitable he is, particularly in contrast to David Welwyn who has been friends with Sarah since childhood. Lee-Wortley is there with his sister who is recovering from an operation and is confined to her room, convalescing. Colin, Michael, and Bridget are disappointed with Poirot as he does not meet their expectations of what a detective should look like. They hatch a plan to arrange a false murder for Poirot to detect with Bridget lying in the snow with blood as the \\"dead\\" body and footprints leading through the snow which is now falling and expected to grow heavier. They decide that they will put their plan into operation on Boxing Day, as Colonel Lacey would not like something of that nature to take place on Christmas Day itself. That night, the Christmas tree is decorated and the party retire to their rooms for the night. On his pillow, Poirot finds a scrawled note which reads, \\"DON'T EAT NONE OF THE PLUM PUDDING. ONE WHO WISHES YOU WELL.\\" He is most puzzled. The next day, the party eats a huge Christmas dinner, and then the elderly and partly retired butler brings in the Christmas pudding with great ceremony. The diners find the usual tokens in their portions, but the Colonel is annoyed and amazed when he almost chokes on a piece of red glass in his. Poirot takes the object and pockets it. Afterwards, Poirot visits the kitchen to compliment the daily cook, Mrs Ross, on the meal and particularly the pudding. She confesses that two were made, one for that day and one for New Year's Day, but the one for Christmas Day was dropped and the one for six days later substituted in its place. That night, Poirot pretends to sleep in his bed, having avoided drinking a drugged coffee which had been handed to him by Lee-Wortley. A figure enters his room and conducts a fruitless search. The next morning, the children carry out their \\"murder\\" plan and rouse Poirot from his bed to investigate the \\"dead\\" body but the planners get a shock when Poirot confirms that Bridget is indeed dead, Sarah and Lee-Wortley having joined them in the snow. Poirot invites the young man to check Bridget's pulse and he confirms there isn't one. Poirot points out that the footprints in the snow look like Lee-Wortley's and that in the dead girl's hand is the glass \\"ruby\\" from the pudding. Lee-Wortley is dumbfounded but, taking the glass, offers to ring for the police. Claiming to Diana that the phone is dead, he drives off to fetch them. Poirot takes the others in the house where he explains all. He tells them that Lee-Wortley is a blackmailer and involved in other questionable matters. His supposed sister is the young woman who took the ruby from the eastern prince, and the two of them were tracked to Kings Lacey. Bridget appears in the room ‚Äî she is not dead, having worn a tourniquet on her arm when lying in the snow, and was in league with Poirot to trick Lee-Wortley. Poirot heard the children planning their \\"murder\\" through an open window and used this opportunity to take Lee-Wortley in. The \\"ruby\\" that Bridget held in the snow was a paste copy that Poirot brought with him to the house, and Lee- Wortley has taken this with him. Poirot supposes that he will go abroad, where he will be surprised when he tries to sell the false jewel. The real ruby was hidden by the two thieves in what they were told was the New Year pudding, and they were unaware of the accident that befell the pudding intended for Christmas Day. Lee-Wortley's \\"sister\\" overhears this and is furious that her co-conspirator has left her to face the music. She too flees the house. The mystery of who left the note on Poirot's pillow is solved when one of the housemaids confesses that she heard Lee-Wortley and his \\"sister\\" discussing getting Poirot out of the way and that something had been put in the pudding, causing her to think they planned to poison him. He rewards her by promising her a vanity box, and gets a kiss from Bridget under the mistletoe. =The Mystery of the Spanish Chest= Poirot's attention is caught by newspaper headlines which tell of the latest developments in the \\"Spanish Chest Mystery\\". At his request Miss Lemon prepares a pr√©cis of the case. A Major Charles Rich held a small party at his flat. The guests were a Mr and Mrs Clayton, a Mr and Mrs Spence and a Commander McLaren. At the last minute, Mr Clayton received an urgent telegram summoning him to Scotland that night on business and did not attend the party. Shortly before the party, he had a drink with McLaren at their club where he explained his coming absence and then before going to the station, took a taxi to Rich's to offer his apologies. Rich was out but Burgess ‚Äì Rich's manservant ‚Äì let him in and left Clayton to scribble a note in the sitting room while he carried on his preparations in the kitchen. Some ten minutes later, Rich returned and sent Burgess out on a short errand. Rich denies seeing Clayton at the flat nor did Burgess after leaving the man to write his note. The party went well. The next morning, Burgess noticed what seemed to be bloodstains on a rug that were seeping from a Spanish chest in the corner of the room. Opening it, the startled man found the stabbed body of Mr Clayton. Rich has now been arrested as the obvious suspect but Poirot sees a flaw in that he cannot see how or why Rich would calmly have gone to bed with a bleeding corpse in the chest. He is able to start investigating the case when a mutual friend recommends him to Mrs Clayton. Meeting the widow, he is struck by her beautiful innocence and realises quickly that she is attracted to Major Rich although she denies having an affair with him. She does admit that she wasn't in love with her closed and emotionless husband. He then sees each of the people involved in the party in turn who each agree about the charms of Mrs Clayton and the lack of emotion in her husband. Poirot has some suspicions of Burgess and goes to Rich's flat where the manservant shows him the scene of the crime. Inspecting the chest, Poirot finds some holes in the back and side and asks Burgess if anything in the room is noticeably different from the night of the party. He is told that a screen in the room was almost in front of the chest on the night. Remembering a reference to Othello used by Mrs Spence, Poirot realises the truth. Mr Clayton is Othello and his wife is Desdemona and the missing character of Iago is in fact Commander McLaren. He is in love with Mrs Clayton and, jealous of her attraction to Major Rich, planned the perfect crime whereby Clayton would die and Rich be accused of the murder. He made numerous subtle suggestions to Clayton about his wife's infidelity to the point where the man himself hatched a plan to fake a summons to Scotland and then found a reason to get into Rich's flat where he hid in the chest to observe what happened in his absence during the party. McLaren, playing records for the people to dance to, nipped behind the screen, opened the chest and stabbed his friend. Poirot feels certain that if the theory is put to McLaren he will confess.The 1991 TV adaptation follows the original storyexcept for having Poirot at the party; changing McLaren to \\"Colonel Curtiss\\"; and having Curtiss nearly stab Poirot with a sword cane until Major Rich saves Poirot by fighting a sword duel with Curtiss. =The Under Dog= Sir Reuben Astwell was murdered ten days previously at his country house, Mon Repos, when he was violently hit on the back of the head with a club, and his nephew Charles Leverson has been arrested. Sir Reuben's wife, Lady Astwell, is convinced that the true criminal is the late man's secretary, Owen Trefusis, although she doesn't have a shred of evidence to back up this claim, relying instead on \\"intuition\\". She sends her young companion, Lily Margrave, to Poirot to employ him on the case and Poirot accepts, partly because he senses that Lily does not want Poirot to investigate the matter and that she has something to hide. Arriving at Mon Repos Poirot speaks with the daunting and domineering Lady Astwell who tells him that Sir Reuben's brother and business partner, Victor, is also a guest in the house. Both brothers were equally as hot-tempered as the other and there were many rows and disagreements in the house, quite often involving Charles Leverson, with Sir Reuben often taking his temper out on the servants. Poirot interviews Parsons, the butler, who is one of the main witnesses in the case. His bedroom is on the ground floor and above him is the \\"Tower Room\\", Sir Reuben's sanctum. It is a lofty room with another room above reached by a spiral staircase and was originally an observatory built by a previous owner who was an astronomer. Sir Reuben was writing late at night and Parsons was asleep when he was awakened by the sound of Leverson returning home near midnight and letting himself in. He heard Leverson shouting at his uncle followed by a cry and a dull thud. About to go upstairs to see what was happening, Parsons then heard Leverson saying \\"No harm done, luckily\\" and then wishing his uncle goodnight. The next day, Sir Reuben was found dead. Speaking with Trefusis, the somewhat meek man admits that during his nine years employment, he was ruthlessly bullied by Sir Reuben. Trefusis shows Poirot the scene of the crime and the detective is puzzled as to why there is a bloodstain on the writing desk but Sir Reuben's body was found on the floor. Poirot tries an experiment with his valet, George, and realises that Sir Reuben was clubbed as he sat in his chair and remained in position afterwards as the chair is low-down in comparison to the desk. Poirot is more suspicious than ever of Lily Margrave's nervous demeanour and investigates the two local hotels to see if anyone was staying that night who left the hotel near midnight. He finds such a man ‚Äì Captain Humphrey Naylor ‚Äì and convinced there is a link with Lily sets a trap by putting his own blood on a scrap of the dress that she was wearing that night and telling her he found it in the Tower Room. She confesses that she is Naylor's sister and that he was swindled out of an African gold mine by Sir Reuben. Determined to find proof she agreed with her brother to take employment as Lady Astwell's companion and on the night in question, as her brother waited outside, she went to the Tower Room and saw Leverson leaving it. She then went into the room herself and found the body on the floor (she also rifled the safe and found the proof of the swindle her brother was after) but she is innocent of the crime of murder. Poirot believes her and also realises that Leverson was drunk on the night in question and his strange manner is as a result of starting to shout at his uncle, pushing his shoulder and then realising he was dead as the body slid to the floor ‚Äì hence the thud that Parsons heard. He is innocent as well as his uncle was killed earlier than when he was in the room. Poirot persuades Lady Astwell to partake in hypnosis to recall events of the night of the murder. She confirms what she has already told the police ‚Äì that she argued with her husband in the Tower Room some ten minutes prior to Leverson coming back home. She also manages to recall a subliminal memory of the normally-controlled Trefusis breaking a paper knife in anger earlier in the evening when again being shouted at by Sir Reuben (thus triggering her suspicions of the man) and a strange bulge in the curtain which covered the spiral staircase to the upper portion of the tower room. Poirot realises someone was already there when she and her husband were arguing. Poirot begins a game of nerves with everyone in the house, extending his stay and searching everyone's bedrooms, much to their annoyance. He also claims to find something on the spiral staircase which will seal the murderer's fate and leaves it in a box in his room while he makes a quick trip to London. He returns and tells the gathered household that Trefusis is indeed the murderer but the crime was not premeditated. The secretary had left something in the upper portion of the Tower Room and was fetching it when he found himself to be an unwilling witness to the row between Sir Reuben and Lady Astwell. After she left the room, he tried to sneak out but was spotted and received another barrage of abuse from his employer. After nine years of such treatment, he was unable to take any more and struck Sir Reuben down. The item Poirot found on the stairs was false but George, hidden in the wardrobe of Poirot's room, saw Trefusis steal the box in which the item was hidden when Poirot was in London. Lady Astwell is delighted ‚Äì her intuition has proven correct. =Four and Twenty Blackbirds= Poirot is eating out with a friend, Henry, and the conversation turns to people's habits. Henry eats regularly in the restaurant that they are in and he points out a white-bearded man as evidence of his theories. This bearded man eats the same meal there on Wednesday and Saturday and always orders much the same items as part of his three-course meal. The waitress brings their meals and sees Henry staring at the bearded man. She tells him that except the previous week he also came in on Monday and ordered things he'd never ordered before. Poirot's curiosity is piqued. Three weeks later, Poirot and Henry meet on a tube train and during the conversation Henry mentions that the bearded man has not been seen for a week. Henry's theory is that he has died and his change of habits on the Monday in question was as a result of being told bad news by his doctor. Poirot is not certain and starts to investigate. He easily finds the man's name from a list of recent deaths, and with a suitable introduction, meets the dead man's doctor. The man lived alone and died after an accidental fall downstairs at his house and was found near the milk bottles. He died at approximately 10.00 p.m. on that day and had eaten a meal a couple of hours before, at the same restaurant Poirot saw him in. He had a letter in the pocket. In response to the question of relatives, Poirot is told that the man had a twin brother, Anthony, who died on the afternoon of the same day as his brother after a long illness and that their only surviving relative is a nephew, George Lorrimer. Poirot is interested in the dead man's teeth and it is confirmed that they were very white for their age. After several calls of investigation, Poirot meets Lorrimer and accuses him of murder. Lorrimer's response proves the accusation has hit home. Meeting Henry again, Poirot explains: Anthony left a large fortune to his (dead, but estranged) brother. Lorrimer would eventually inherit but was impatient for the money. He actually murdered him, and then in disguise, he impersonated his uncle at the restaurant. However, he forgot to impersonate his uncle's eating habits and ordered different foods to those usually chosen, including blackberry tart for dessert. His uncle didn't eat food which stained the teeth whereas Lorrimer's teeth are stained. =The Dream= Poirot is summoned by letter to the home of reclusive and eccentric millionaire Benedict Farley. He is shown into the office of Farley's personal secretary, Hugo Cornworthy, but finds the millionaire himself alone in the darkened room. Poirot is made to sit in the light of a bright desk lamp and he is not impressed with the man, dressed in an old patchwork dressing gown and wearing thick glasses, feeling that he is stagy and a mountebank and doesn‚Äôt possess the charisma he would expect from such a rich and powerful person. Farley tells him that he is troubled by a nightly dream in which he is seated at his desk in the next room and at exactly 3.28 p.m., he takes out the revolver he keeps in his desk drawer and shoots himself. Various doctors have been unable to explain this to him, and he has now turned to the famous detective. Poirot wonders if he has enemies who would want to kill him, but Farley knows of no one. Poirot asks to see the room where the dream is set, but Farley refuses and Poirot therefore takes his leave. Before he goes Farley asks him for the letter he sent him to be returned, and Poirot hands it over but then realises he handed over the wrong one and Farley didn't notice. The correct letter is exchanged. A week later, an acquaintance, Dr Stillingfleet, phones Poirot and tells him that Farley has shot himself. Poirot goes to the house and meets the doctor, a police inspector, the dead man's second wife, his daughter from his first marriage, Joanna, and Hugo Cornworthy in whose office Poirot had had his meeting with Farley. Poirot tells them all of the reason for the previous visit. There is surprise on the part of some members of the party, but Mrs Farley was told by her husband of the dreams, and she confirms that he kept a revolver in his desk drawer. Her husband seems to have killed himself in precisely the way and at the time the dream foretold. Two visitors were outside his room waiting to see him. Farley spoke to them briefly to tell them he wouldn't be long and then went inside his room. After a considerable period of time, Cornworthy went in and found the dead body. No one could enter the room in the interim. There is a window with no climbable ledge and opposite the window is a blank wall. Poirot feels that the wall is important. He examines the room and finds a pair of extendable tongs which take his interest. He asks various questions of the people gathered there, one of which is to ascertain if Farley had bad eyesight without his glasses and he is told he had. Poirot has the solution: On his previous visit, he did not see Farley but a disguised Cornworthy. It was the secretary who sent the letter to Poirot and he gave the butler instructions to let him in and take him to his own office, not Farley's room. Wearing thick glasses, he was unable to see that Poirot had returned the wrong letter. The act put on by Cornworthy explains why Poirot wasn't as impressed by the man as he expected him to be. Cornworthy lured Farley to the window of his room by a distraction and then shot him by leaning out of his own window, overseen by no one because of the blank wall. He left the man dead for a short while and then went to \\"find\\" the body, planting the revolver there. His co- conspirator was his lover, Mrs Farley, who was the only other person who claimed that the dreams were real and that the revolver was kept in the desk drawer. She gives the game away by attempting to attack Poirot but is held back by Stillingfleet. =Greenshaw's Folly= Raymond West, the writer-nephew of Miss Marple, shows Horace Bindler, a literary critic, round the grounds of a local hall popularly known as 'Greenshaw's Folly'. It was built in the 1860s or 1870s by a man who had made an immense fortune but had little idea of architectural style, the house being a strange mish mash of buildings from around the world. Although strictly speaking they are trespassing, they are nevertheless welcomed by Miss Greenshaw, the elderly granddaughter of the man who built the house, when they come across her in her garden. She is a sharp, slightly shrewish woman who keeps her staff of two in order. They are Miss Cresswell, her companion, and Alfred, a young gardener who is constantly in dispute with Miss Cresswell. Miss Greenshaw takes advantage of the presence of the two visitors to ask them to witness the will she has just had drawn up. This leaves everything to Miss Cresswell in lieu of unpaid wages, as Miss Greenshaw is determined that nothing will go to her last living relative, her nephew, the son of a roguish man called Harry Fletcher who ran away with one of her sisters. They sign the will in the library where Miss Greenshaw shows them the copious diaries of her grandfather and expresses a wish to have them edited and published, but says she hasn't the time to undertake such a task. The two visitors take their leave, slightly puzzled by a comment from Miss Greenshaw to the effect that she thought they were policemen when she saw them in her grounds‚Ä¶ When discussing the visit later in the company of Miss Marple, Joan West and her niece, Louise Oxley, the latter offers to undertake the work of editing the diaries while Miss Marple ponders the similarity between Miss Greenshaw and a Mr Naysmith who liked to give false impressions for fun, sometimes leading to trouble. Louise Oxley is employed to work on the diaries and begins work at Miss Greenshaw's house. The next day she is asked to invite the old lady's estranged nephew, Nathaniel Fletcher, to lunch, but is told not to inform Miss Cresswell. When told of this, Raymond suspects a reconciliation and a change in the will may ensue. The day after, on arriving at the house, Louise is struck by the resemblance between Alfred and a portrait of Miss Greenshaw's grandfather. She is working on the diaries at midday in her first- floor room when she hears a scream from the garden, and sees Miss Greenshaw staggering towards the house with an arrow embedded in her breast. When Louise tries to go down to help Miss Greenshaw as she collapses into the room below her, she finds that she is locked in. A few windows along, Miss Cresswell shouts that she is in the same predicament. A police constable who arrives a few minutes later frees the women from their respective rooms; he is followed by a police sergeant and then Nathaniel Fletcher, who arrives for his lunch appointment. That evening, Inspector Welch interviews Raymond about the will he witnessed. Miss Marple guesses correctly that, contrary to what Raymond and Horace Bindler were told, Miss Cresswell was not the beneficiary to the will ‚Äì Miss Greenshaw was playing her along, behaviour just like that of Mr Naysmith. The recipient of Miss Greenshaw's money is Alfred, who is probably a grandson of one of Miss Greenshaw's grandfather's illegitimate children, hence the resemblance in looks. Alfred is a member of an archery club but has a cast- iron alibi for the time of the murder. Miss Marple has a hypothesis: that the Miss Greenshaw that Louise met over her two days was actually Miss Cresswell in disguise. Miss Greenshaw was unconscious at the time that she was \\"shot\\" and the dying person on the lawn that Louise saw was Miss Cresswell with a false arrow. The first \\"policeman\\" who arrived at the house was really Nathaniel Fletcher, Miss Cresswell's accomplice. He claimed the companion had been locked in her room from which he freed her, whereas in reality she had been free to impersonate her employer and dupe Louise into being a witness to the \\"crime\\". The pair aimed to pin the blame on Alfred, not realising he had gone to the pub for his lunch earlier than usual and, therefore, had an alibi. When Miss Marple sees the rockery on which 'Miss Greenshaw' had been working has had plants pulled up as well as weeds, something a skilled gardener would never do, she realises her guess was correct. Alfred inherits 'Greenshaw's Folly'. Literary significance and reception Maurice Richardson of The Observer on 18 December 1960 said, \\"She has never been at her best in the short form. These six are exceedingly far from masterpieces. Yet they engender a ghost of the old Christmas number euphoria, still, and may ease you during a plethora, or one of those Stations of the Cross on wheels, called railway journeys.\\"The Observer, 18 December 1960 (p. 20) Robert Barnard: \\"A late collection, with several of the 'long-short' stories which suit Christie well. Less rigorous than her best, however, and the last story, Greenshaw's Folly, has a notable example of Miss Marple's habit of drawing solutions from a hat, with hardly a trace of why or wherefore.\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive ‚Äì an appreciation of Agatha Christie ‚Äì Revised edition (p. 187). Fontana Books, 1990; References to other worksDr Stillingfleet who plays a role in \\"The Dream\\" later appears in the full-length book Third Girl. *Poirot's reference to believing 'six impossible things before breakfast\\" in The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding is a quotation from chapter 5 of Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll when Alice says that she cannot believe in impossible things and the White Queen replies that she hasn't had enough practice and that she, 'always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.' Adaptations =Television= All five of the Poirot stories were adapted for television as part of the series Agatha Christie's Poirot. \\"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\\" was adapted under the American name \\"The Theft of the Royal Ruby\\". The story was slightly altered. The entire family, including the thieves, discovers the ruby in the pudding during Christmas dinner, and Poirot, pretending that it is a fake, takes it to safeguard it in his room. When Bridget is apparently murdered, Poirot places the real ruby, not a paste one, in the supposedly dead girl's hand. Lee-Wortley makes off with it, together with Iris Moffat, a girlfriend who has been pretending to be his sister Gloria. (Moffatt had previously stolen the jewel while on a date with Prince Farouk of Egypt.) Lee-Wortley does not abandon Moffatt to \\"face the music\\", as he does in the story. The two thieves try to make their getaway in a private plane which crashes into a field after a pursuit from David (who mistakenly believes Sarah is running off with Lee-Wortley). Poirot and the police are also there. The criminals, unhurt, are both arrested on the spot and the ruby is returned to the Prince. It is only afterwards that Poirot explains what has really been going on to the family. Bridget says goodbye to him at the end along with the others, but does not kiss him under the mistletoe. \\"Greenshaw's Folly\\" was adapted as part of the sixth series of Agatha Christie's Marple, starring Julia McKenzie.
