Facts Mrs O'Hanlon had clinical depression. She had absences from work at the Inland Revenue because of her disability, but also some from unrelated sicknesses. She was paid according to the employers' sick pay rules, that full salary would be given for a maximum of six months and then half pay for a further six months up to a maximum of one year in any four-year period. After that the pension rate of pay would be given. Mrs O'Hanlon argued these rules amounted to discrimination under the DDA 1995 s 3A(1) because the Revenue were failing to pay her fully for illness connected with her disability. Further, she argued that this was breaching the duty to make reasonable adjustments (s 4A). A reasonable adjustment, she suggested, would be full pay after the usual six- month period expired. The tribunal held that she was not less favourably treated than others and in any case disparate treatment would have been justified since the cost of changing sick pay policy would have been excessive. Furthermore, although Ms O'Hanlon was at a disadvantage because of the sick pay rules, the employers had taken reasonable steps by reducing her hours and transferring her to an easier location (from Welwyn Garden City to Hertford) to commute from after her return. The Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed her appeal. Mrs O'Hanlon appealed again. Judgment The Court of Appeal (Ward, Sedley and Hooper LJJ) dismissed Mrs O'Hanlon's appeal and held in favour of the Revenue. It held that it would be invidious for an employer to have to determine whether to increase sick pay payments for everyone, or separate a disability related element out, merely because it created additional financial hardship for a disabled claimant. Resulting stress from lack of money during sick periods could equally be felt be a non-disabled person who was absent from work for a similar period. Once a tribunal had found that increasing sick pay was not a \\"reasonable adjustment\\" (s 4A) the test of justification was satisfied under s 3A(3).

He is currently the Verne M. Willaman Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the Pennsylvania State University, University Park. He is known for his work on multigrid methods, domain decomposition methods, finite element methods, and more recently deep neural networks. Academic Biography Xu received his bachelor's degree from the Xiangtan University in 1982, his master's degree from the Peking University in 1984, and his doctoral degree from the Cornell University in 1989. He joined the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in 1989 as assistant professor of mathematics, was promoted to associate professor in 1991, and to professor in 1995. He was named a Distinguished Professor of Mathematics in 2007, the Francis R. and Helen M. Pentz Professor of Science in 2010, and the Verne M. Willaman Professor of Mathematics in 2015. He is currently the director of the Center for Computational Mathematics and Applications at Penn State. Xu serves on the editorial boards of many major journals in computational mathematics and co-edits many conference proceedings and research monographs. He also serves on various college and departmental committees and organizes numerous colloquiums and seminars. He has organized or served as a scientific committee member for more than 65 international conferences, workshops, and summer schools. Research Interests and Contributions Xu is an advocate of the idea that practical applications and theoretical completeness and beauty can go together. He studies numerical methods for partial differential equations and big data, especially finite element methods, multigrid methods, and deep neural networks, for their theoretical analysis, algorithmic development, and practical applications. He is well known for many groundbreaking studies in developing, designing, and analyzing fast methods for finite element discretization and for the solution of large-scale systems of equations, including several basic theories and algorithms that bear his name: the Bramble-Pasciak-Xu (BPX) preconditioner, the Hiptmair-Xu (HX) preconditioner, the Xu-Zikatanov (XZ) identity, and the Morley-Wang-Xu (MWX) element. The BPX-preconditioner is one of the two fundamental multigrid algorithms for solving large-scale discretized partial differential equations; the HX-preconditioner, which was featured in 2008 by the U.S. Department of Energy as one of the top 10 breakthroughs in computational science in recent years, is one of the most efficient solvers for the numerical simulation of electro-magnetic problems; the XZ-identity is a basic technical tool that can be used for the design and analysis of iterative methods such as the multigrid method and the method of alternating projections; the MWX-element is the only known class of finite elements universally constructed for elliptic partial differential equations of any order in any spatial dimension. Xu has published nearly 200 research papers, including his famous SIAM Review paper ‚ÄúIterative Methods by Space Decomposition and Subspace Correction‚Äù (1992) and more recently his Acta Numerica paper ‚ÄúAlgebraic Multigrid Methods‚Äù (2017). In recent years, Xu has become interested in developing training algorithms for deep learning models and their applications, such as Alzheimer's disease, pathological image recognition, and pulse data analysis. He constructed the connections of ReLU deep neural networks and the classical linear finite element. Xu proposed a new idea for understanding ResNet models from the viewpoint of the multigrid method and also proposed iRDA training algorithms for the training process in CNN, which can achieve a sparse result in this context. Awards and Honors Xu has published nearly 200 scientific papers and was ranked among the most highly cited mathematicians in the world by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) (e.g. top 25 worldwide for the years 1991 to 2001). He was a plenary speaker at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied MathematicsICIAM conference website. in 2007 and a 45-minute invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians 2010, Hyderabad.List of plenary and invited speakers of ICM. In 2011, Xu was honored as a Fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)List of SIAM fellows, class of 2011. for his outstanding contributions to the theory and applications of multilevel and adaptive numerical methods. In 2012, he was elected as an inaugural Fellow of the American Mathematical Society (AMS).List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-09-01. Xu received the Liu Memorial Award at Cornell University in 1988, the Natural Science Award from the National Academy of Science in China in 1989, and the Schlumberger Foundation Award in 1993. In 1995, Xu's research accomplishments were recognized with the first Feng Kang Prize for Scientific ComputingList of Feng Kang Prize winners. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

It centers on a young couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home. They then set up a camera to document what is haunting them. The film utilizes found-footage conventions that were mirrored in the later films of the series. Originally developed as an independent feature and given film festival screenings in 2007, the film was shot for $15,000. It was then acquired by Paramount Pictures and modified, particularly with a new ending that cost an additional total of $200,000. It was given a limited U.S. release on September 25, 2009, and then a nationwide release on October 16, 2009. The film earned nearly $108 million at the U.S. box office and a further $85 million internationally for a worldwide total of $193 million. Paramount/DreamWorks acquired the U.S. rights for $350,000. It is the most profitable film ever made, based on return on investment, although such figures are difficult to verify independently as this is likely to exclude marketing costs. The film is the first (chronologically, the third) entry in the Paranormal Activity film series. A parallel sequel and prequel, Paranormal Activity 2, was released in 2010. The success of the first two films would spawn additional films in the series: the prequel Paranormal Activity 3 in 2011, and Paranormal Activity 4 (the sequel to the second installment) in 2012. The fifth installment, The Marked Ones, was released in 2014, and the sixth installment, The Ghost Dimension, was released in 2015. On June 19, 2019, Paramount announced that a seventh installment is in development and will be released on March 19, 2021. However, in August 2020, it was announced it would be delayed until March 4, 2022. Plot In 2006, Katie and Micah, a young couple, move to a new house in San Diego. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous psychic, Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off the negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie, advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously. The camera captures many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and the bedroom door moving. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, soon worsening the situation. During night one, keys are heard jangling. The thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, and the door slams shut. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During night fifteen, Katie appears to be in a clear trance as she gets out of bed, and stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day. Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the board's pointer piece to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During night seventeen, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couples are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie. Katie finally calls the demonologist but learns he is out of the country. The events of the film have psychologically terrified Katie, which has strengthened the demon's power. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is unnerved by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope. On night twenty, Katie is pulled out of the bedroom and the demon attacks her in the dark. The camera is motionless the entire time, leaving the audience unaware what happened. It is shown that the demon has bitten Katie. Micah discovers the bite mark and decides events are too out of control to remain in the house. He packs for them both to head to a motel. Micah finds that Katie is unresponsive, and notices she is holding a cross so tightly that her hand is bleeding. Micah takes the cross and burns it. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they stay, then apparently talks to someone next to her, saying they will be okay now. On night twenty-one, Katie gets out of bed again, and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah and he quickly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah screams in pain, Katie stops screaming, and, after another moment of silence, heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, a loud roar is heard as Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway, with blood on her shirt. She slowly walks into the room, and crawls to Micah's body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black, and another growl is heard. Text states that Micah's body was discovered by the police on October 11, 2006, and Katie has vanished. Cast * Katie Featherston as Katie * Micah Sloat as Micah * Mark Fredrichs as Dr. Fredrichs * Amber Armstrong as Amber * Ashley Palmer as Diane * Spencer Marks as Dr. Johann Averies Production Attempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and eliminating the need for a camera crew, a \\"higher degree of plausibility\\" was created for the audience as they were \\"more invested in the story and the characters\\". Peli says that the dialogue was \\"natural\\" because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as \\"retroscripting\\" also used in the making of The Blair Witch Project. In casting the movie, Peli auditioned \\"a few hundred people\\" before finally meeting Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, \\"If you saw the [audition] footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years.\\" During a guest appearance on The Jay Leno Show on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work. The film was shot out of sequence due to Peli's self-imposed seven-day shooting schedule, though he would have preferred the story to have unfolded for the actors as he had envisioned it. Sloat, who controlled the camera for a good deal of the film, was a former cameraman at his university's TV station. \\"It was a very intense week\\", Peli said, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the acting footage was being finalized. Multiple endings were conceived, but not all of them were shot. The film was screened at 2007's Screamfest Horror Film Festival, where it impressed an assistant at the Creative Artists Agency, Kirill Baru, so much that CAA signed on to represent Peli. Attempting to find a distributor for the film and/or directing work for Peli, the agency sent out DVDs of the movie to as many people in the industry as they could, and it was eventually seen by Miramax Films Senior Executive Jason Blum, who thought it had potential. He worked with Peli to re-edit the film and submitted it to the Sundance Film Festival, but it was rejected. The DVD also impressed DreamWorks executives Adam Goodman, Stacey Snider, and finally Steven Spielberg, who cut a deal with Blum and Peli. DreamWorks' plan was to remake the film with a bigger budget and with Peli directing, and only to include the original version as an extra when the DVD was eventually released. \\"They didn't know what to do with [the original]\\", said Blum; they just wanted to be \\"in business\\" with Peli. Blum and Peli agreed, but stipulated a test screening of the original film before going ahead with the remake, believing it would be well received by a theatrical audience. During the screening, people began walking out; Goodman thought the film was bombing, until he learned that the viewers were actually leaving because they were so frightened. He then realized a remake was unwise. Paramount Pictures, which acquired DreamWorks in 2005, bought the domestic rights to the film, and worldwide rights to any sequels, for US$350,000. When the film was taken in by Paramount, several changes were made. Some scenes were cut, others added, and the original ending was scrapped, with two new endings being shot. The ending shown in theaters during the film's worldwide release is the only one of the three to feature visual effects, and it differs from the endings previously seen at the Screamfest and Burbank screenings. The theatrical release was delayed indefinitely because Paramount had put all DreamWorks productions on hold. Meanwhile, a screening for international buyers resulted in the sale of international rights in 52 countries. Only after Goodman became production chief at Paramount in June 2009 did the film finally get slated for a fall release. Alternate endings Once Paramount acquired the film, the original ending was scrapped, and two new endings were developed for the film, one of them being the one seen in theaters (the scrapped ending was shown at only one public viewing). Original Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Her friend Amber calls and leaves a message, saying that she is concerned because she hasn't heard from Katie or Micah. Amber eventually comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, scaring Amber out of the house before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. Police officers arrive at the house about a half hour later and discover Micah's body as well. They call to Katie, who wakes from her catatonic state and seems confused. Katie comes out of the bedroom with the knife still in her hand. The police officers ask her to drop the knife. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind one of the police officers slams shut, startling one of the officers, which causes him to shoot Katie, killing her. The film ends with the police investigating the area and finding nothing but the camera, still running. Studio ending In this ending, available as an alternate ending in the home releases of the film, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera before cutting her own throat. The screen then fades to black. Unfilmed ending A third alternate ending was written in which a possessed Katie would corner Micah and bludgeon him to death with his camera, while viewers watch from the camera's point of view. This version was deemed too complicated and too brutal to shoot. Release Paranormal Activity premiered at Screamfest Horror Film Festival in North America on October 14, 2007, was shown at the Slamdance Film Festival on January 18, 2008, and screened at the 36th Annual Telluride Film Festival on September 6, 2009.The 36th Telluride Film Festival Draws to a Close The version with the new ending, made after Paramount acquired the film, had screenings on September 25, 2009, in twelve college towns across the United States. The venues included Ann Arbor, MI; Baton Rouge, LA; Boulder, CO; Columbus, OH; Durham, NC; Lincoln, NE; Madison, WI; Orlando, FL; Santa Cruz, CA; Seattle, WA; State College, PA; and Tucson, AZ. Eleven of the twelve venues sold out with State College, PA being the only exception due to a Penn State football game that was held the same night. On his website, director Oren Peli invited internet users to \\"demand\\" where the film went next by voting on Eventful. This was the first time a major motion picture studio used the service to virally market a film. On September 28, Paramount issued a press release on Peli's website, announcing openings in 20 other markets on October 2, including larger market cities such as New York and Chicago. On October 3, it was reported that a total of 33 screenings in all 20 markets had sold out and that the film had earned $500,000 domestically. A day later, Paramount announced that the film would have a full limited release in 40 markets, playing at all hours (including after-midnight showings). On October 6, Paramount announced that the movie would be released nationwide if the film received one million \\"demands\\" on Eventful. The full limited release of the film started on October 9. On October 10, the Eventful.com counter hit over one million requests. Paramount announced soon after that the film would get a wide domestic release on October 16 and expand to more theaters on the October 23. By November, it was showing in locales worldwide. Home release Paranormal Activity wasn't released on DVD or Blu-ray until December 29, 2009, more than two years after the film was made. The home release includes one alternate ending to the theatrical version. It was released in the United Kingdom on March 22, 2010, on DVD and Blu-ray with some specials. In the Netherlands the movie received a release on VHS in 2010. Additionally, at the end of the film, 15 minutes worth of names were added to the DVD release, as part of a special promotion. The message that popped up before this said: \\"The fans who \\"demanded\\" the film were asked by email if they wanted to have their name appear as a thank you for the film's success.\\" Reception Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating of 83% based on 204 reviews, with an average rating of 7.01/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Using its low-budget effects and mockumentary method to great result, Paranormal Activity turns a simple haunted house story into 90 minutes of relentless suspense.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Film critics James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert each awarded it 3.5 stars out of a maximum of 4 stars. Ebert stated in his review, \\"It illustrates one of my favorite points, that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x. For extended periods here, nothing at all is happening, and believe me, you won't be bored.\\" Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman gave Paranormal Activity an A‚àí rating and called it \\"frightening...freaky and terrifying\\" and said that \\"Paranormal Activity scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clich√©s.\\" Bloody Disgusting ranked the film 16th in their list of the \\"Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade\\", with the article saying, \\"Peli deserves props for milking the maximum amount of tension out of the spare, modern setting‚Äîan ordinary, cookie-cutter tract home in San Diego. It doesn't sound very scary, but Peli manages to make it terrifying. If you aren't white-knuckling your armrest at least once or twice while watching it, you probably don't have a pulse.\\" However, some critics disliked the film. Michael Carter of The Breeze summed up the film as \\"all right\\", though denouncing its reliance on \\"cheap jump scares and an even cheaper 'found footage' style\\". David Stratton of the Australian television series At the Movies said that \\"it was extremely unthrilling, very obvious, very clich√©d. We've seen it all before.\\" Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle called it \\"an excruciatingly tedious YouTube gag cleverly marketed to go viral\\". Bill Gibron of PopMatters listed the film as the second worst horror film of all time, writing that it lacked \\"anything remotely redeeming for the seasoned fright fan\\", and was \\"a waste of time in both concept and execution\\". Box office The film opened on September 25, 2009 to twelve theaters and took $36,146 on its opening day and $77,873 on its first weekend for an average of $6,489 per venue. It had more success when it opened to 33 theaters on October 1, 2009, doubling the box office reception, grossing $532,242 for an average of $16,129 per venue, bringing the 10-day total to $776,763. As it expanded to 160 theaters on the October 9‚Äì11 weekend, the film grossed $2.7 million on that Friday, having a per-theater average of $16,621. It went on to gross $7.9 million. Over the weekend, the film reached the week's highest per- theater average of $49,379, coming in at fourth for the weekend, behind Couples Retreat, Zombieland, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Over the weekend of October 16, 2009, Paranormal Activity expanded to 600 more theaters, grossing $19.6 million with $25,813 per theater average gross, and bringing the total gross to $33.2 million. On the weekend of October 23, 2009, Paranormal Activity rose to first, beating out Saw VI, earning $21,104,070, expanding to 1,945 theaters for an average of $10,850 per theater, compared with the $14.1 million gross from 3,036 theaters, and $4,650 average for Saw VI. The film has grossed $107.9 million domestically and $85.4 million in foreign markets, with a total gross of $193.4 million. The Hollywood Reporter estimated the film made a net profit of $78 million. Accolades The film was nominated for Best First Feature in the Independent Spirit Awards 2009.

Biggs was one of six brothers to play rugby for Cardiff, and captained the team for a season in 1904/05. Although he was never capped at an international level, he has been described as \\"...one of the great uncapped Welsh players.\\"Davies (1975), pg 242. Rugby career Biggs came from a large sporting family. Six of his brothers played for Cardiff Rugby Football Club, most notably Norman (1886‚Äì1899) and Selwyn (1889‚Äì1901). Norman, Selwyn and Cecil himself were all captains of Cardiff RFC and all three also played for the Barbarians, though, unlike Norman and Selwyn, Cecil never represented Wales.. Cecil Biggs joined Cardiff in the 1898/99 season, and by the next year he had been given his Reserves team cap.Davies (1975), pg 47. By the 1900/01 season he was part of the first team and in his first season he was the team's second highest try scorer with 16.Davies (1975), pg 48. For the next three seasons, Biggs was the club's top scorer with 16, 16 and 24 tries respectively. In the 1904/05 season Cecil was elected as first team captain,Davies (1975), pg 53. after serving as Gwyn Nicholl's vice-captain in the previous season.Davies (1975), pg 51. Biggs chose as his vice-captain the prop forward Billy O'Neill (in many records shown as Billy Neill) Despite playing for Cardiff in the 1905/06 season, Biggs missed the encounter between Cardiff and the first touring All Blacks team. The next season saw the first tour of the South African national side, and Biggs was part of the Cardiff team to face them. Of all the Cardiff players on that day only Biggs and Dicky David were uncapped at international level, and David would be selected to play for Wales in 1907. Cardiff beat the South Africans 17-0, made all the more impressive by the fact that Biggs was injured in the first few minutes of the game, which as good as reduced the team to 14 men.Billot (1974), pg 60.

Irisin is a cleaved version of FNDC5, named after the Greek messenger goddess Iris. Fibronectin domain- containing protein 5 is a membrane protein comprising a short cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane segment, and an ectodomain consisting of a ~100 kDa fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain.  History  FNDC5 was discovered during a genome search for fibronectin type III domains and independently in a search for peroxisomal proteins. The ectodomain was proposed to be cleaved to give a soluble peptide hormone named irisin. Separately it was proposed that irisin is secreted from muscle in response to exercise, and may mediate some beneficial effects of exercise in humans and the potential for generating weight loss and blocking diabetes has been suggested. Others questioned these findings.  Biosynthesis and secretion  The FNDC5 gene encodes a prohormone, a single-pass type I membrane protein (human, 212 amino acids; mouse and rat, 209 amino acids) that is upregulated by muscular exercise and undergoes post-translational processing to generate irisin. The sequence of the protein includes a signal peptide, a single fibronectin type III domain, and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain that is anchored in the cell membrane. The production of irisin is similar to the shedding and release of other hormones and hormone-like polypeptides, such as epidermal growth factor and TGF alpha, from transmembrane precursors. After the N-terminal signal peptide is removed, the peptide is proteolytically cleaved from the C-terminal moiety, glycosylated and released as a hormone of 112 amino acids (in human, amino acids 32-143 of the full-length protein; in mouse and rat, amino acids 29-140) that comprises most of the FNIII repeat region. The sequence of irisin, the cleaved and secreted portion of FNDC5, is highly conserved in mammals; the human and murine sequences are identical. However, the start codon of human FNDC5 is mutated to ATA, which causes it to be expressed at only 1% the level of other animals with the normal ATG start. A mass spectrometry study reported irisin levels ~3 ng/ml in human plasma, a level on par with other key human hormones, such as insulin.. There is no comparable study of irisin levels in other animals, where the ATG vs ATA start codon would predict a 100x higher concentration. A difference in the nucleotide sequence of human FNDC5 from that of mouse Fndc5 creates a different initiation codon, potentially generating a protein that begins at methionine-76 (Met-76). A protein initiated at Met-76 would be missing the signal peptide and would be trapped in the cytoplasm. Via mass spectrometry, irisin has been found to circulate in humans in levels similar to other key hormones, such as insulin..  Function  Exercise causes increased expression in muscle of peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha), which is involved in adaptation to exercise. In mice, this causes production of the FNDC5 protein which is cleaved to give a new product irisin. Due to its production through a mechanism initiated by muscular contraction, irisin has been classified as a myokine. Based on the findings that FNDC5 induces thermogenin expression in fat cells, overexpression of FNDC5 in the liver of mice prevents diet-induced weight gain, and FNDC5 mRNA levels are elevated in human muscle samples after exercise, it has been proposed that irisin promotes the conversion of white fat to brown fat in humans which would make it a health promoting hormone. However this proposal has been challenged because FNDC5 is upregulated only in highly active elderly humans. A 2016 in vitro study of white and brown fat cell tissue found dose-related upregulation of a protein called UCP1 that contributes to the browning of white fat and found other markers that would indicate that the white cells were browning and that fat cells were more metabolically active. Many of the stem cells became a type of cell that matures into bone. The tissue treated with irisin produced about 40 percent fewer mature fat cells. In mice, irisin released from skeletal muscle during exercise acts directly on bone by increasing cortical bone mineral density, bone perimeter and polar moment of inertia.

At his death, his property and honors passed to his brother, Florent. Career Claude was lord of Haultpenne in Fl√©malle, a Walloon area in the bishopric of Liege. His nickname is derived from the name of the castle, an elegant medieval and renaissance structure. He was a member of the council of states of the Seventeen Provinces, and he was captured in 1576 with his father. Although he signed the Union of Brussels, but immediately afterwards travelled to Namur, where he joined the Spanish faction and tried to win the favour of Don John of Austria. His father died in 1578, and in 1579, his oldest brother, Gilles, killed at the Siege of Maastricht; Claude succeeded his brother as governor of Charleville. In 1581 Haultpenne was sent to fight Dutch rebels in the eastern province of Friesland, but the capture of Steenbergen on 12 August 1583 signalled the need for his return to Brabant. In 1581 he led the Siege of Breda, also known as the Haultepenne's Fury. Breda had been in the hands of William of Orange since the Pacification of Ghent in 1576. Haultpenne managed to enter the city by bribing a sentry, after which his troops sacked and plundered it, murdering more than 500 citizens. He defended 's-Hertogenbosch, and reconquered Lier, Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Guelders, after which he became its Stadtholder from 1583‚Äì1585. The Duke of Parma had great confidence in Haultpenne's abilities, and sent him to the Electorate of Cologne, which was rife with disorder arising out of conflicting claims by Calvinists and Catholics to the Electorate and its possessions. In the Cologne War, Berlaymount laid siege to Werl in 1586,. Although Martin Schenck von Nydeggen had a force of approximately 500 men, and Berlaymount over 4000 plus horse and cannons, Schenck succeeded in fighting his way out of the city and to safety. While at Boxtel, Haultpenne received a call for aid from 's- Hertogenbosch. On his way there, he engaged an enemy army led by Philip of Hohenlohe at a redoubt at Engelen, and was mortally wounded in the throat. He was taken to 's-Hertogenbosch, where he died on July 14.

The central part of the zone lacks Archean rock, however, leading at least one group of scientists to speculate that it was formed very late in the Paleoproterozoic Era. The Great Falls tectonic zone has been periodically active since the Proterozoic, and possibly as late as the Holocene. Little of the zone is visible due to Phanerozoic cover, the exception being the Little Belt Mountains. However, it is believed that the tectonic zone controlled the geologic development of nearby basins and subbasins.O'Neill, J.M., editor. Metallogeny of Mesoproterozoic Sedimentary Rocks in Idaho and Montana‚ÄîStudies by the Mineral Resources Program, 2004‚Äì2007. U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2007‚Äì1280. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Geological Survey, 2007. The Great Falls tectonic zone was first identified in 1985. Geologists originally believed the zone was part of the Wyoming craton, but now conclude that it is distinct from it. There is continuing controversy over whether the region is a shear zone or suture,Sears, James W.; Harms, Tekla A.; and Evenchick, C.A. Whence the Mountains?: Inquiries Into the Evolution of Orogenic Systems: A Volume in Honor of Raymond A. Price. Boulder, Colo.: Geological Society of America, 2007. and the role the zone played in the formation of the North American continent. At one time, both the Great Falls Tectonic Zone and the Vulcan structure were both considered sutures, but debate remains open on the point. At least one group of geologists has concluded the zone represents the closure of an ocean basin. The zone lacks gravity anomalies or electromagnetic signatures which would allow scientists to conclude that it was generated by subduction. There is significant evidence that the zone has been periodically remineralized since Precambrian times.Foster, F. and Childs, J.F. \\"An Overview of Significant Gold Lode Systems in Montana, and Their Regional Geologic Setting.\\" Explorations in Mining Geology. 2 (1993); Hoy, T. \\"The Purcell Supergroup in Southeastern British Columbia: Sedimentation, Tectonics and Stratiform Lead-Zinc Deposits.\\" In Precambrian Sulfide Deposits.

In September 2009 Ndoma-Egba noted that several prominent people in Cross River had defected from the Action Congress and the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) to join the PDP, saying the event was a sign that opposition has crumbled in the state. In January 2013 Ndoma-Egba said that the solution to Cross River community clashes was the National Boundary Commission becoming involved in the demarcation of boundary lines. Ndoma-Egba was reelected as Senator for Cross River Central on 26 April 2011 on the PDP platform, winning 143,537 votes, while the runner up was Patric Iwara of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), who gained 47,656 votes.

His territory included the region from the eastern portion of the Great Slave Lake, in the Northwest Territories, Canada, to the Coppermine River, in Nunavut. He was recruited to act as interpreter, guide, and hunter for John Franklin's first of three Arctic expeditions, the Coppermine Expedition of 1819‚Äì1822. Career Akaitcho was considered a man \\"of great penetration and shrewdness\\" and an aggressive leader. His tribe, who spoke their own dialect, consisted of the northwesternmost Chipewyan people. They traded meat supplies to the North West Company's Fort Providence trading post, situated on the East Arm of the Great Slave Lake. They were also known for pillaging, stealing women, and killing Dogrib and Hare Indians. Coppermine Expedition In 1820, when his tribe numbered about 190, Akaitcho and his men, including Akaitcho's brothers, Humpy and White Capot,Richardson (1994), pp. 42 were recruited by the North West Company to serve as guides and hunters for a Royal Navy expedition, a search for the Northwest Passage. Besides Franklin, the expeditionary group consisted of John Richardson, doctor and naturalist, Midshipmen Robert Hood and George Back, and Ordinary Seaman John Hepburn. They met at Fort Providence, on the north side of the lake, in July.Franklin (2008), pp. 222-223 Akaitcho's terms included cancellation of his tribe's debts to the North West Company, plus provisions of cloth, ammunition, tobacco, and iron products. In return, his men would hunt and guide for the expedition during its north-bound journey on the Coppermine River, and they would leave food supplies for Franklin's return. But Akaitcho warned Franklin that food would not always be available. They reached the winter encampment of Fort Enterprise on Winter Lake, named by Franklin and chosen by Akaitcho, with food supplies running short and Franklin's men losing faith in him; it would be several months before weather would permit them to continue their travels. The Franklin expedition restarted again in June 1821 and they reached the Arctic Ocean by July 14. After Franklin issued orders to the Yellowknives to leave food caches along the way back to Fort Enterprise, and to restock Fort Enterprise, the Yellowknives left for their return trip home. However, for several reasons, they did not re-stock Fort Enterprise. First, three of Akaitcho hunters died falling through ice on a frozen lake. Second, Akaitcho did not receive ammunition supplies at Fort Providence, something he needed in order to kill game. But the main reason was Akaitcho's belief that the expedition was folly, and that Franklin's party would not live to return to Fort Enterprise.Fleming (1941), pp. 149-150 Within weeks, Back returned to Fort Enterprise, before Franklin, and found it devoid of food. He set off for Fort Providence, eventually reaching it and convincing some of Akaitcho's men to return with him to Fort Enterprise. Back and three Yellowknives returned to Fort Enterprise on 7 November to find the starving Franklin party had arrived. The Yellowknives brought meat, caught fish, and tended to the survivors. A week later, the group left Fort Enterprise, safely reaching Fort Providence on 11 December. In their subsequently published journals, Franklin referred to the chief as \\"Akaitcho\\" or \\"Big Foot\\", Richardson referred to him as \\"Akaicho\\" or \\"Gros Pied\\", and Back referred to him as \\"Ekeicho\\". Later years When the Fort Providence trading post closed in 1823, Akaitcho had to trade into Fort Resolution, in competition with Chipewyan already established with that post. His power and influence began to diminish. Akaitcho became a peacemaker in 1825 when, at Mesa Lake, he participated in a famous peace treaty with Dogrib Chief Edzo, ending a long period of hostility and warfare between Chipewyan and Dogrib. In 1833-34, when Back returned to Fort Reliance, establishing it as a base camp during his search for the lost John Ross expedition, Akaitcho's energy and resolve commanded Back's respect. By the time he was 50, Akaitcho was in poor health and his power over his tribe diminished. Personal life In addition to brothers Humpy and White Capot (Annoethai-yazzeh), Akaitcho had at least one other brother, Keskarrah, who was known to accompany Matonabbee, a Chipewyan chief. A sister was married to Fran√ßois Beaulieu, a M√©tis chief. Of Akaitcho's seven wives, the one that bore him his only son was his favorite.Franklin (2008), pp. 308 In old age, out of respect, Akaitcho and his elder wives were transported by younger men whenever the tribe moved. Legacy Akaicho's legacy is honored with the formation of the Akaitcho Territory Government, a First Nations organization representing the Dene people of the Northwest Territories. Akaitcho Lake, located in Nunavut, between Great Bear Lake and the Coppermine River, is also named in his honor.

A talented vedutist, master of chiaroscuro art and trompe-l'≈ìil optical illusions, Gonzaga was primarily known for his fantastic yet deceptively realistic stage sets, and summarized the theory and purpose of his art as music for the eyes (): \\"a perspective that changes in relation to variations in musical expression.\\"Ferrero, p. 2 According to Ferrero, Gonzaga was the first to promote scenic design into an art \\"in its own right\\" and shake off the derided image of mere decoration devoid of art.Ferrero, pp.19-20 With age he lost confidence in his profession and aspired, in vain, to become a practicing architect. Career in Italy Subterranean Mausoleum, 1780s, Art Institute of Chicago. Gonzaga was born in Longarone, Italy. He trained in Venice in 1769-1772 under Giuseppe Moretti and Antonio Visentini. He was influenced by the art of Canaletto, Bibiena, Tiepolo but most of all Piranesi. In 1772 he joined the art firm of Galliari family.Korndorf In 1779 Gonzaga debuted as solo stage designer in Teatro alla Scala production of ballets by Giuseppe Canziani and Sebastiano Gallet,Romani, p. 8 and stayed with this theatre until the 1792 season.Romani, p. 21 Subsequently, he produced over sixty sets in Milan, Genoa, Rome and Venice. His curtain for the La Fenice theatre became a standard copied by numerous imitators.Ferrero, p. 3 Gonzaga's Italian works, along with Galliari family legacy, were published in Milan in three installments in 1803‚Äì1821.Ferrero, p. 85 Gonzaga's life changed after meeting prince Nikolay Yusupov, personal envoy of Catherine II of Russia to Italian states who was based in Turin in 1784‚Äì1789. Yusupov returned to Saint Petersburg in 1791 to accept the role of managing entertainment of the imperial court, which placed him at the helm of state theatre companies. It is not known reliably whether Gonzaga was invited to Russia by Yusupov or by Giacomo Quarenghi, but in 1792 Yusupov, representing the state, and Gonzaga signed a hire contract that made the latter chief decorator (stage designer) for all performances of the Saint Petersburg state theatre, with an unusually generous pay provision. Yusupov remained Gonzaga's patron until their deaths in 1831. Gonzaga's line of scenic design at La Scala was continued by his trainee Paolo Landriani.Kirk, p. 144 Career in Russia Nikolskaya towerNote that in 1801 the tower did not yet have its current neo-gothic spire. It was erected in 1806, destroyed by French troops in 1812 and recreated in 1816. of Moscow Kremlin for the coronation of Alexander I, 1801, Hermitage Museum Gonzaga surprised Saint Petersburg audience by novel use of optical illusions and bold chiaroscuro that supported them (dim, diffused light of oil lamps of the period washed out subtle tones and called for radical, contrasting blacks and whites). According to Alexander Benois, \\"he painted right on floor, not like in easel painting, but simply sketching with a thick brush, spreading paint with his foot, and this foot painting under artificial lighting completely enchanted [the witnesses].\\" \\\\- Contrary to recommendation of Alexander Cozens, he sketched his drafts in lampblack, not black ink.Ferrero, p. 84 Gonzaga dominated the art department of imperial theatres for over thirty years, surviving three monarchs: Catherine II, Paul I and Alexander I. He decorated coronations of Paul (1797), Alexander I (1801) and Nicholas I (1826) while his lifelong benefactor Yusupov administered all three events. Gonzaga became a trusted consultant to heiress and later empress Maria Fyodorovna, Golitsyn and Yusupov families and diversified into decorating palace interiors and landscape design. Fyodor Glinka described Gonzaga's three-dimensional trompe-l'≈ìil folly in Pavlovsk Park (1815): \\"What is a reality and what is a dream? ... Convinced at the existence of what was before me, I kept going further and further forward. But suddenly something strange began to happen to my eyes: it was as if an invisible curtain of some sort was descending upon these objects and swallowing them from sight ... At length I began to quarrel with my own eyes and my head began to spin, and I hastened to be gone from this realms of charms and magic!\\"Cited, in English, at length in: Newlin, p. 119 Gonzaga summarized his experience and theory of theatrical presentation and illusion in a series of books printed in Saint Petersburg in French language, notably the 1807 Information a mon chef and 1800 La musique des yeux et l'optique theatrale (English: Music for the Eyes).Publication years as in Ferrero, p. 117 Gonzaga claimed that optical illusions are not abstract theories but correspond to \\"things that are easily perceived when one looks with a certain degree of attention\\", thus the stage set should be designed as a \\"perceived reality to be grasped with attention in all changing aspects.\\" Aging Gonzaga gradually became more and more dissatisfied with his work, that of producing ephemeral follies that rarely lasted longer than a single theatrical season. He suffered depression, feeling that his life was spent in vain, and begged his patrons to offer him a chance to prove himself in architecture and leave a tangible trace of his talent. He applied to all available vacancies and architectural contests, and was always rejected. By 1827, when emperor Nicholas awarded him an honorary title of court architect Gonzaga was already too old for practical construction. Nestor Kukolnik suggested that earlier, in 1810s, Gonzaga designed and built Yusupov's private theatre in Arkhangelskoye Estate, but his attribution was later discarded. He died in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1831. Works Graphic artwork by Gonzaga are preserved in the Hermitage Museum, the National Gallery of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago Arkhangelskoye Estate museum stocks the original stage curtain painted by Gonzaga and four complete original stage backdrops out of sixteen he produced for Yusupov's private theatre. The museum intends to make life-sized copies for public display, as the originals are too fragile. Elektronny Arhiv, a Russian company that digitized this artwork, claimed to have built the world's largest scanner specifically for this job (similar claims were made by other companies, i.e.).

Food presentation is the art of modifying, processing, arranging, or decorating food to enhance its aesthetic appeal. The visual presentation of foods is often considered by chefs at many different stages of food preparation, from the manner of tying or sewing meats, to the type of cut used in chopping and slicing meats or vegetables, to the style of mold used in a poured dish. The food itself may be decorated as in elaborately iced cakes, topped with ornamental sometimes sculptural consumables, drizzled with sauces, sprinkled with seeds, powders, or other toppings, or it may be accompanied by edible or inedible garnishes. Elaborately decorated tea party birthday cake Historically, the presentation of food has been used as a show of wealth and power. Such displays often emphasize the complexity of a dish's composition as opposed to its flavors. For instance, ancient sources recall the hosts of Roman banquets adding precious metals and minerals to food in order to enhance its aesthetic appeal. Additionally, Medieval aristocrats hosted feasts involving sculptural dishes and shows of live animals. These banquets existed to show the culture and affluence of its host, and were therefore tied to social class. Contemporary food aesthetics reflect the autonomy of the chef, such as in nouvelle cuisine and Japanese bento boxes. Dishes often involve both simplistic and complex designs. Some schools of thought, like French nouvelle cuisine, emphasize minimalism while others create complicated compositions based on modern aesthetic principles. Overall, the presentation of food reflects societal trends and beliefs. Plating The arrangement and overall styling of food upon bringing it to the plate is termed plating. Some common styles of plating include a 'classic' arrangement of the main item in the front of the plate with vegetables or starches in the back, a 'stacked' arrangement of the various items, or the main item leaning or 'shingled' upon a vegetable bed or side item. Item location on the plate is often referenced as for the face of a clock, with six o'clock the position closest to the diner. A basic rule of thumb upon plating, and even in some cases prepping, is to make sure you have the 5 components to a dish; protein, traditionally at a 6 o'clock position, vegetable, at a 2 o'clock position, starch at an 11 o'clock position, sauce and garnish. History Ancient Rome Roman banquet scene from Herculanum, Italy Banquets were important social events, usually hosted in private residences for friends and clients. The Romans placed great focus on the appearance of their dining room (triclinium), decorating it with murals and mosaics, as well as lavish sculptures and furniture. The overall purpose of a private banquet was entertainment, not only through live performances, but also through the presentation of the food itself. The meal consisted of three courses- appetizers, main course, and dessert- brought out in elaborate rituals. For instance, the main course was sometimes served to the tune of trumpets at particularly luxurious events. Foods that were particularly valued were wild game, such as pheasant and boar, certain kinds of fish, and wild berries, mainly because of their exoticism and high price. Some ancient writers recount Emperor Claudius adding crushed pearls to wine and flecks of gold to peas solely to increase their cost. Others recall live animals being served as shows of entertainment and richness. For instance, at one event mackerels were pickled live in order to showcase their silvery bodies thrashing in vinegar.Martial, Epigrams, XIII.10 Medieval Europe Medieval aristocrats also desired to entertain and impress through food. Banquets were usually huge feasts with diverse choices of dishes. Social etiquette dictated that the wealthy and powerful be given beautiful and elaborate dishes while the poor be given simple food, usually scraps. Such banquets not only entertained guests, but also showed the wealth of the host. In particular, the patron sometimes commissioned artists to create complicated sculptures made from food items to awe and inspire. Particular favorites were pies or cakes designed to expel live birds when cut open and multicolored jellies stacked together, dyed with spices and vegetable matter. Contemporary In the same way, contemporary food reflects both personal and societal aesthetic beliefs. While cuisine in the past was intrinsically related to wealth and social status, contemporary cuisine is much less distinguished by class. The disintegration of highbrow and lowbrow foods has led to increased accessibility of various foods. Now, it is possible to find a hamburger at a five star restaurants and exotic cuisines on street corners. Therefore, contemporary food presentation is determined much more by modern aesthetics and creativity than displays of wealth and power. France Nouvelle cuisine is a school of French cooking that rejects ostentatious displays of food in favor of simple presentation and high-quality ingredients. In contrast to historical chefs that obeyed the orders of patrons, this manner of cooking elevates the chef from a skilled worker to an inventor and artist. The aesthetic of nouvelle cuisine emphasizes minimalism, serving fewer courses and utilizing simple plating. Chefs were extremely creative in constructing innovative recipes and plating. Japan Example of a bento box  Bento Box  A bento box is a Japanese meal traditionally consisting of rice, meat/fish, and vegetables served in a portable box. In Japan, as well as in the United States, a large focus is placed on the aesthetic arrangement of the food. There have even been contests to see who can come up with the most inventive way of creating bento boxes, allowing for creativity in amateur chefs and everyday people. Sometimes bento boxes are used to make sculptural designs, such as rice shaped to look like animals. These specific types of bento boxes are known as Kyaraben or charaben, („Ç≠„É£„É©ÂºÅ) a shortened form of character bento. („Ç≠„É£„É©„ÇØ„Çø„ÉºÂºÅÂΩì kyarakutƒÅ bent≈ç) Kyaraben are most often made by mothers to encourage their children to eat more nutritious diets and as a way of showing their love and dedication.  Kaiseki  Kaiseki cuisine in Kyoto, Japan Kaiseki (ÊáêÁü≥) is a Japanese multi-course haute cuisine dinner consisting of 7-14 courses, often served at ryokan, but also in small restaurants known as ry≈çtei, particularly in Kyoto. A large focus of kaiseki is in the elaborate preparation and aesthetic presentation of these meals to enhance the natural flavors of fresh, local ingredients. Meals are often garnished with edible leaves and flowers to enhance the seasonality of the meal and its ingredients and are arranged to resemble natural plants and animals. Kaiseki dinners most commonly involve an appetizer, sashimi, a simmered dish, a grilled dish, and a steamed dish. Other dishes may be added or omitted depending on the chef. * Sakizuke (ÂÖàÈôÑ): An appetizer. * Hassun (ÂÖ´ÂØ∏): A course of sushi and several small side-dishes. * Muk≈çzuke (Âêë‰ªò): A dish of sliced, seasonal sashimi. * Takiawase (ÁÖÆÂêà): A dish of simmered vegetables served with meat, fish or tofu. * Futamono (ËìãÁâ©): A ‚Äúlidded dish‚Äù; typically a soup. * Yakimono (ÁÑºÁâ©): A flame-broiled dish, typically fish. * Su-zakana (ÈÖ¢ËÇ¥): A small dish of vegetables in vinegar, typically used for cleansing the palate. * Hiyashi-bachi (ÂÜ∑„ÅóÈâ¢): Chilled, lightly cooked vegetables.

Science  Modern science can illuminate how and why people respond in certain ways to food plating and presentation. According to a sociological study, people react differently to various aesthetic principles such as color, composition (including a number of components, placement of components, and use of negative space), design, and the organization of a plate. They found that participants responded best to plates with four different colors, three different components, some empty space, and with a disorganized and casual design. This research is particularly important because understanding how food presentation affects how people eat can be used in the study of health and nutrition. For instance, another study showed that participants who ate off of uncleaned tables (i.e. all uneaten food was left on the table) ate less than those that had their tabled periodically cleaned. This is presumably because those that could see the leftovers of what they had eaten were less likely to take more food. This could be useful, for instance, in combatting the obesity endemic. Another example of science in food aesthetics is the development of molecular food in Spain, which emphasizes the essence of food using scientific elements. Molecular science can break down the roles of carbohydrates and protein in order to isolate what creates particular tastes. For instance, modern science makes it possible to freeze ice cream using liquid nitrogen and create wine using sugars, creating efficient and visually interesting new dishes. Trends and fads Like other aspects of culture, food presentation is subject to trends and fads. For instance, \\"unicorn food\\", a style of presentation that uses a rainbow color palette to decorate food, became popular in 2017. The pastel-like hues are supposed to represent the colors of the mythical unicorn.

Located in northeast Konak, it is the largest transportation complex in ƒ∞zmir, as well as the Aegean Region. The complex offers connections between ƒ∞ZBAN commuter rail service, ƒ∞zmir Metro rapid transit service, Tram ƒ∞zmir tram service and ESHOT city bus service. Halkapƒ±nar Transfer Center was originally opened in 1865 as a railway station. The transfer center opened on 22 May 2000 together with a new metro station and bus terminals and was the first complex to offer direct connection between heavy rail and rapid transit service in Turkey. History The oldest part of Halkapƒ±nar Transfer Center is the railway station. Originally built by the Smyrna Cassaba Railway (SCP), Halkapƒ±nar railway station opened on 20 July 1865 along with the railway from Basmane to Kar≈üƒ±yaka and Bornova. Halkapƒ±nar station was located just before the Bornova line diverged off the mainline to Kar≈üƒ±yaka and later Afyon. The SCP was bought by the Turkish State Railways in 1934, which continued to operate commuter trains that stopped at Halkapƒ±nar. In a plan to improve rail service around ƒ∞zmir, the city municipality began planning a commuter rail and rapid transit network. Halkapƒ±nar was designated to become the primary transfer point between the two systems. In 1994, the State Railways sold the Bornova Branch to the city of ƒ∞zmir, which began construction of the ƒ∞zmir Metro along its right-of-way. Construction of the ƒ∞zmir Metro saw the addition of two new platforms and a maintenance facility at Halkapƒ±nar. The new facilities were completed in 1999 and Halkapƒ±nar Transfer Center officially opened on 22 May 2000. In anticipation for expanded commuter service to Aliaƒüa, Halkapƒ±nar station was electrified with overhead wire. The station was electrified in 2001, but never used. In 2006, plans for a new commuter railsystem, ƒ∞ZBAN, were finalized and the rehabilitation of the railway began. Between 2006 and 2010 Halkapƒ±nar saw a suspension of heavy rail trains, due to the construction of railway tunnels in ≈ûirinyer and Kar≈üƒ±yaka. Service returned on 5 December 2010, with the inauguration of the Northern Line to √áiƒüli. Ever since ƒ∞ZBAN began operating, Halkapƒ±nar has become the busiest station in ƒ∞zmir and one of the busiest stations in Turkey. In order to accommodate the thousands of daily passengers, a second overpass was built to the east of the existing one in 2013. In 2016, Halkapƒ±nar saw a total of over 24 million boardings. Layout The ƒ∞ZBAN platform of Halkapƒ±nar looking towards the main overpass, the ƒ∞zmir Metro station is to the left. Halkapƒ±nar has a total of five island platforms serving nine tracks, three for metro and four for heavy rail in the main complex and two in the tram stop. The two platforms on the southern side are for ƒ∞zmir Metro trains on the Fahrettin Altay‚ÄîEvka 3 Line. Out of the other two platforms, the south platform (adjacent to the ƒ∞zmir Metro platforms), is for ƒ∞ZBAN commuter trains, while the fourth platform is currently used for parking the freight stock. Prior to 2016, that platform was used by intercity and regional trains to Eski≈üehir, Balƒ±kesir, Bandƒ±rma, U≈üak and Konya. On both sides of the platforms are railyards. On the north side is a small freight yard, used by TCDD Ta≈üƒ±macƒ±lƒ±k, for freight trains using the nearby Port of ƒ∞zmir. On the south side is the ƒ∞zmir Metro's Halkapƒ±nar Maintenance Facility, used for layovers and maintenance of their rolling stock. A new depot for Tram ƒ∞zmir equipment has been built, next to the metro depot. Further south of the under construction tram depot is a bus garage, used by ESHOT, for their city bus fleet. City buses arrive and depart from two separate bus terminals, located on opposite sides of the complex. The larger bus terminal, with 9 bus bays and 17 halts, is located to the southwest, accessible via ≈ûehitler Avenue. The majority of buses depart from this terminal. The second and smaller one, with 6 bus bays and 8 halts, is located on the north side of the complex and is accessible via 1561st Street. Both terminals are accessible via the main overpass, connecting all facilities of the transfer center. The tram station for the Konak Tram is located on the southern side of the complex, along ≈ûehitler Avenue. It is accessible via a walkway.

PM WIN-T has been absorbed into PM Tactical Networks as Product Manager for Mission Networks. PM WIN-T designs, acquires, fields and supports tactical networks and services for US Army Soldiers, most notably the WIN-T suite of communication technologies. About PM WIN-T provides the communications network (satellite and terrestrial) and services that allows the Warfighter to send and receive information in tactical situations. WIN-T is the transformational Command and Control system that manages tactical information transport at theatre through Company Echelons in support of full spectrum Army operations. Besides WIN-T Increments 1, 2, and 3 (WIN-T), PM WIN-T is also responsible for the following systems, among others: the Area Common User System Modernization (ACUS MOD); Regional Hub Nodes (RHN); SIPR/NIPR Access Points (SNAP); Deployable Ku Band Earth Terminals (DKET); Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T); Phoenix/Super High Frequency (SHF); Global Broadcast Service (GBS), Standardized Integrated Command Post System (SICPS); and Harbormaster Command and Control Center (HCCC). WIN-T History In 1982 the Army embarked on the acquisition of the Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) system, at an overall cost of more than $4 billion, to fill communications requirements from division down to the battalion level. MSE filled tactical telephone and switchboard requirements with a smaller, more mobile switching capability than had previously been used. However, military operations in Desert Storm in 1991, as well as Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 revealed inadequacies in MSE to support highly mobile and dispersed forces in a digital environment. Before the widespread availability of satellite communications technology, battlefield communications required the installation and maintenance of relay towers and cables, limiting range and flexibility of missions. The outdated MSE could no longer keep up with the pace of battle. WIN-T was conceived to solve this problem and to enable mobile mission command on the battlefield. The systems development and integration for Project Manager WIN-T began in 2002. Consequently, the Joint Network Node (JNN) network, as an outgrowth of the 3rd Infantry Division Operational Needs Statement, was developed to bridge the gap between MSE and the \\"full\\" on-the-move WIN-T network capability. The JNN network provided battalion-level and above with the ability to connect to the Army's digitized systems, voice, data and video via satellite Internet connection at-the-quick-halt. It obtained instantaneous battlefield success. As a result, the Army, along with Congressional assistance in the form of supplemental funding, shifted their priority from WIN-T to JNN. The fielding of JNN started in 2004 to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the result of a Nunn-McCurdy restructure on June 5, 2007, the WIN-T program was restructured into four separate Increments. The JNN program was integrated into WIN-T as Increment 1. Further development led to Increment 2, which was first fielded in 2012. Funding re-allocation is currently being debated by Congress. WIN-T Increment 1 WIN-T Increment 1 provides networking at- the-halt capability down to battalion level (1a) with a follow-on enhanced networking at-the-halt (1b) to improve efficiency and encryption. WIN-T Increment 1 components reside at the theater, corps, division, brigade and battalion levels. WIN-T Increment 1 provides a full range of data, voice and video communications at-the-quick-halt, which allows Soldiers to simply pull over on the side of the road to communicate without wasting valuable time setting up complicated infrastructure. WIN-T Increment 1 is a Joint compatible communications package that allows the Soldier to use advanced networking capabilities, and is also interoperable with current force systems and future increments of WIN-T. WIN-T Increment 1a upgrades the former Joint Network Node (JNN) satellite capability to access the Ka-band defense Wideband Global Satellite (WGS), reducing reliance on expensive commercial Ku-band satellite. WIN-T Increment 1b introduces the Net Centric Waveform (NCW), a dynamic waveform that optimizes bandwidth and satellite utilization and Colorless Core technology, which further enhances security. Capabilities: * Communications at-the-quick-halt * Interoperable with all current and future WIN-T Increments * Provides interface to legacy systems * Encrypts classified traffic over Department of Defense (DoD) unclassified network * Supports modularity by allowing a brigade combat team to have self-sustaining reach back communications * Provides Internet infrastructure connectivity directly to the battalion level and above * Allows independent deployment of command posts and centers constrained by line-of-sight radio ranges * Connects the Soldier to the Global Information Grid /Defense Information Systems Network * Transitions Army networks from proprietary protocols to Everything Over Internet Protocol * Incorporates WIN-T Increment 2 technical insertions for improved capability WIN-T Increment 2 WIN-T Increment 2 provides networking on-the-move (OTM) capability through the addition of a secure networking package on existing Tactical Vehicles. This package employs military and commercial satellite connectivity and line-of-sight (terrestrial) radios and antennas to achieve end-to-end connectivity and dynamic ad hoc mobile networking operations. WIN-T Increment 2 extends the network to company level for maneuver brigades for the first time. WIN-T Increment 2 increases mobility and provides a communication network down to the company level. Tactical Communication Nodes in Increment 2 are the first step to providing a mobile infrastructure on the battlefield. Combined with the Points of Presence, Vehicle Wireless Packages, and Soldier Network Extensions, Increment 2 enables mobile mission command from division to company in a completely ad hoc, self- forming, self-healing network. The WIN-T Increment 2 addition of embedding communications gear in select vehicles brings Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) and CENTRIX (CXI) into the warfighting platform. Select staff have the ability to maneuver anywhere on the battlefield and maintain connectivity to the network. WIN-T Increment 2 began fielding in October 2012 to the 4th BCT, 10th Mountain Division at Fort Polk, LA. The system made its combat debut in Afghanistan in July 2013 with the 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment (4BCT/10MTN). In particular, the Point of Presence greatly enhanced the ability of 2-4IN to maintain network access, increasing situational awareness and threat warning while on the move and at the halt during multiple week- long, long range expeditionary advising operations with the Afghan National Army.http://www.dvidshub.net/news/115525/cs-13-not-just-guys-ground Capabilities: * Increment 2 supports initial collaboration, mission planning and rehearsal, and for the first time introduces mobility to the network. * Increment 2 brings a mobile network infrastructure, which means the network stays connected while moving. * Increment 2 extends the network down to Company level. WIN-T Increment 3 WIN-T Increment 3 will provide the fully mobile, flexible, dynamic tactical networking capability needed to support a highly dispersed force over isolated areas. Building on previous increments, it will support full network planning and execution while on-the- move for maneuver, fires and aviation brigades. WIN-T Increment 3 also introduces the aerial tier to enhance reliability. WIN-T Increment 3 provides full network mobility and introduces the air tier creating a three-tiered architecture: traditional line-of-sight (terrestrial), airborne through the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems and other airborne platforms; and beyond-line- of-sight (satellite). Additionally WIN-T Increment 3 introduces embedded Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance (JC4ISR) radios into the platforms.

It provides Internet network management capabilities, as well as integrated voice video and data services. It also allows for beyond-line-of-sight transmission capability, which enables Soldiers to communicate with one another from separate physical locations. Capabilities * Increased situational awareness to unit commanders * Improved throughput and Joint interoperability * Implements commercial-based technology insertions into the Current Force * High Capacity Line of Sight (HCLOS) radio upgrades to Warfighter Information Network- Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 1 units * Extends selected network capabilities to the battalion level * Deployment orders to fire support radars * Secure wireless connections both between and within tactical operations centers and command posts * S6 functionality into a single vehicle shelter Regional hub nodes  Regional hub nodes (RHN) serve as transport nodes for Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T), the Army's tactical communications network backbone, as well as the transport medium for theater-based Network Service Centers, which are the basic building blocks for the Army's global network infrastructure. RHNs provide satellite, voice and data services to support forces as they flow into a theater of operations, including domestic disaster relief, and enable deployed units to connect to Department of Defense (DoD) networks. RHNs innovatively use baseband and satellite communications capabilities that enable regionalized reach-back to the Army's global network. The RHNs operate \\"in sanctuary,\\" or out of the fight zone, and were designed to provide division, brigade combat teams and below early access to the Global Information Grid, the infrastructure and services that move information through the global network. The RHN gives the Soldier in the field immediate access to secure and non-secure internet and voice communications, and it allows them to do their job anywhere on the globe. To provide tactical users with secure, reliable connectivity worldwide, the Army has positioned RHNs in five separate strategic regions: Continental United States (CONUS) East and CONUS West, Central Command, European Command, and Pacific Command. Capabilities * Currently used by both deployed Marine Corps and Army units * By enabling forces to mobilize without having to develop their own transport and network access solutions, the cycle time for deployment decreases and Soldiers can focus on the assignment at hand. * Reduces the amount of in- theater support required * Promotes interoperability and a true global network infrastructure * Serve as a gateway to quickly connect expeditionary forces and their tactical Information Technology systems into the enterprise network, giving them access to the network as soon as boots hit the ground SIPR/NIPR access points  Certain locations in theater create unique satellite communication requirements that cause the need for SIPR/NIPR access points (SNAP) to be fielded to augment current program of record solutions. Project Manager Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (PM WIN-T) is bridging gaps in C4ISR created by rugged terrain and sparse infrastructure by deploying these transportable commercial-off-the-shelf Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) satellite terminals that can deploy much more quickly than their traditional counterparts. SNAP terminals provide reliable satellite communication access and take advantage of commercial equipment to expedite the fielding process. They provide access to the tactical and strategic networks for mission command, call for fire, Medevac and information exchange. SNAPs are a key communications component for units, providing secure beyond-line-of-sight communications at the company level and below. SNAPs are designed to provide satellite communications to small units at remote forward operating bases where they are unable to use terrestrial radios due to issues with terrain or distance. Capabilities * Work in concert with WIN-T Increments 1 and 2 * Weigh 1,200 - 1,300 pounds and fit into eight transit cases, which can be transported in the back of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles or helicopters * Modular design allows for varying dish and antenna sizes to appropriately satisfy mission requirements * Easy to move around the battlefield, providing an expeditionary element to the force * Certified Ka and X-band capability to take advantage of the Department of Defense's Wideband Global SATCOM satellites Deployable Ku Band Earth Terminals  Deployable Ku Band Earth Terminals (DKET) are used at the higher level headquarters level, and their role is to transmit tactical communications information out of theater. Some of the DKETs take on dual roles to hub for smaller earth terminals and also to pass along other communication traffic. DKETs also are providing hub services for disadvantaged forward operating bases. DKETs are satellite terminals designed for use at larger hub locations. They support commercial Ku-Band frequencies, and have recently been certified for Ka and X band capability to take advantage of U.S. military satellites. They are highly transportable, self-contained and can establish headquarters- level, network-hub connectivity anywhere a mission demands. Capabilities * DKETs are currently deployed in three configurations: Light (3.7 ‚Äì 3.9M), Mobile (4.5M) and standard (4.6M ‚Äì 7M), with the majority being the light design. This lighter design has a tri-fold antenna and a smaller shelter to make redeployment and setup faster and easier. * The robust DKET network makes for a seamless transition to backup equipment or terminals, eliminates long outages and minimizes impact to the Soldier. * DKETs operate on Ku, Ka and X-band frequencies. * Electronics are housed in separate shelters Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) provides tactical users with secure, survivable, anti-jam, satellite communications in a High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) configuration using equipment to communicate at Extremely High Frequency (EHF) and processes data and voice communications at both low and medium EHF data rates. SMART-Ts are being modified to communicate over Advanced EHF (AEHF) satellite, which significantly increases data rates for future tactical communications networks. The SMART-T makes it possible for Soldiers to extend the range of their network in such a manner that communications cannot be jammed, detected or intercepted. Soldiers at the brigade echelon and above can send text, data, voice and video communications beyond their area of operations without worrying that the information will fall into the hands of enemy forces. Capabilities * Interoperable with future AEHF satellite constellation * Enhanced system interfaces * Provides Low and Medium Data Rate (LDR/MDR) capability for voice and data transmission * Interoperable with Milstar, UHF Follow-On, EHF MIL-STD 1582D and MIL-STD 188-136 compatible payloads * Provides Anti-Jam and anti-scintillation (nuclear environment) communications * Part of the WIN-T architecture and is compatible with both WIN-T Increments 1 and 2 and corresponding equipment Phoenix/Super High Frequency (SHF) Phoenix/Super High Frequency (SHF) provides multi-band capability in the SHF range that operates over commercial and military SHF satellites for Army expeditionary signal battalions and is the Soldier's primary means of reach- back communications. Phoenix/SHF is a tactical satellite terminal that operates using various military and commercial frequencies and allows Soldiers to transmit and receive high bandwidth voice, video and data similar to shipboard communications. It is designed to operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week and provides assured and reliable communications throughout the world.

Along with other sites in Santa Maria, Pedreira do Campo is an area known for the discovery of oceanic fossils, which has allowed a specific assessment of the age of the island. History The first references to this area came from the religious scholar and historian Gaspar Frutuoso who, writing in the 16th century, referred to calcareous sandstone deposits in a quarry near Figuerial, describing the sandstone as \\"...[having] seafood shells glued on [to] it\\". Even after its modern re-discovery, by Garc√≠a-Talavera (in 1997), it attracted little attention, until the first international expedition Paleontology in Atlantic Islands (2002). A workshop followed, entitled Marine Fossils of the Azores: Perspectives on the Future (presented by the Marine Biology section of the University of the Azores and the Portuguese Ordem dos Bi√≥logos), which first suggested \\"a proposal for protection and classification of Pedreira do Campo as a Natural Regional Monument. A technical report was published (M. Cah√£o, et al., 2003) that eventually laid the foundation for the Natural Monument designation. On 25 December 2002, a resolution-in-council by the Regional Government designated Pedreira do Campo as a Regional Natural Monument (Resolution 203/2002), which was approved as Decree 11/2004/A on 23 March 2004. Geography The flowering Scabiosa nitens found in the spaces of Figueiral Pedreira do Campo is a area, once associated with a rock quarrying, but since 2004 integrated into a protected area, that includes exposed sediments, extrusive magmatic and fossil deposits deep and above sea level. The rock formation is delimited by a composite of sedimentary rock from the Touril Volcanic Complex and magmatic rocks of the Facho-Pico Alto Volcanic Complex. These units are estimated at five million years in age, from the Miocene to Pliocene epochs.S√©rgio Avila (2010), p.5 The sedimentary deposits consist of horizontal layers intercalated into volcanic material of limestones, breccias, sandstones and conglomerates, as well as sub-aerial deposits.DRA (2015) It is one of the areas where abundant fossilized bicarbonate rocks have been discovered, including micro- and macro-fossils of algae, coral, bi-valve mollusks, gastropods, echinoderms, as well as bio- eroded sponges and bi-valve skeletons. In terms of natural biological species, the area is known for Myrica faya (evergreen shrub), Myrtus communis (myrtle) and the endemic Scabiosa nitens. Migratory and marine bird species common to the area include the common buzzard (Buteo buteo rothschildi), the Columbian rock pigeon (Columbia livia atlantis), European greenfinch (Carduelis chloris aurantiiventris) and Atlantic canary (Serinus canaria).

History Tram No. 10 at Pile in 1952 The first tram commenced operations on 22 December 1910 between the city gates at (Pile) and nearby port of Gru≈æ, and expanded throughout its life with an extension of the original line to the Dubrovnik railway station, and a second line to Lapad. The last full day of tram service was Friday 20 March 1970. The next morning on the 21st free rides were given to all as a final farewell to the old tramcars, several of which were the originals from 1910. Large crowds, mostly of locals, took advantage of their last chance to ride the trams which ran a special service between Lapad and the railway station at Gruz. At noon a straggled procession was formed of the system's 9 remaining vehicles which filed one by one into the depot which shut its gates without ceremony at 1230. That was the end of the Dubrovnik trams. Road transport services in the city are now exclusively operated by buses.

He also served with distinction during the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars and the Winter War. The Soviet authorities accused him of treason and had him shot during Stalin's military purge of 1941. Career Shtern was born into a Jewish family in Smila, Kiev Governorate in 1900. He started his military career as a Commissar of a Red Army brigade in 1919, the same year he joined the Bolshevik Party. Shtern graduated from the Military Academy of the Red Army in 1929 and worked for the People's Commissariat for Military Affairs. He was appointed commander of the 7th Cavalry Division in 1936. Shtern served as a Soviet military advisor to the Spanish Republican Army during the Spanish Civil War between January 1937 to April 1938. After returning from Spain, Shtern became chief of staff of the Far Eastern Front, commanded by Vasily Blyukher, who would soon be executed in the Great Purge. During the July and August 1938 Battle of Lake Khasan, Shtern was given command of operations after Blyukher's initial counterattack failed. He attacked the Japanese troops on the disputed ridge with numerically superior forces and slowly pushed them back. The pressure of the Soviet attack forced the Japanese to a cease-fire on 11 August as they could not hold the ridge without widening the conflict. On 31 August Stalin decided to abolish the Far Eastern Front as he felt it had not \\"proved its worth\\", and Shtern was given command of the new 1st Red Banner Army. On 9 February 1939 he was promoted to Komandarm 2nd rank. G. Shtern, Khorloogiin Choibalsan and Georgy Zhukov at Khalkhin Gol After a series of border incidents in the spring and early summer of 1939 escalated into the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, Shtern was given command on 5 July of a \\"front group\\", which coordinated all Soviet forces in the Far East. The front group oversaw future World War II commander Georgy Zhukov's 57th Special Rifle Corps, fighting at Khalkhin Gol, but on 19 July the corps was converted into the 1st Soviet Mongolian Army Group and given operational independence from Shtern's command, in order that Zhukov could act without interference from Shtern and on direct orders from the General Staff. According to British military historian Geoffrey Roberts, Shtern played a central role in planning the Soviet counterattack in August, but Zhukov was its chief organizer and executor. Shtern was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 29 August 1939, for his \\"courage and bravery in the performance of military duties\\" at Khalkhin Gol. During the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Shtern became commander of the 8th Army on 12 December 1939. After the Winter War, the Red Army restored traditional military ranks, and Shtern was promoted to Colonel General on 5 June 1940. He was appointed commander of the Far Eastern Front on 22 June 1940. Shtern was arrested on 7 June 1941 during a new purge of the Red Army, and \\"confessed\\" under torture that he had belonged to a Trotskyist conspiracy within the Red Army from 1931, and that he was a German spy. He was shot without trial on 28 October. Shtern was rehabilitated in August 1954.

Its 25th floor houses a free observation deck. The building was completed in 1994. It has been described as a \\"colossal Pez candy dispenser\\" by The Japan Times. The building is near the Tokyo Dome, Tokyo Dome Hotel, Tokyo Dome City, and Tokyo Dome City Attractions.  History  Bunkyo Civic Center stands on the former site of the Bunkyo City Hall (), which opened in April 1959. This was the venue for the first Japan Record Awards. The city hall, which had excellent acoustics, was used mainly as a venue for classical music performances and concerts from the time of its opening until 1977. In 1977 the building was found in violation of fire safety regulations imposed by the Japanese government, and was closed down. The government demolished the city hall and rebuilt it as a government building named Bunkyo Civic Center. The tall civic center includes three basement floors and 28 floors above-ground, making it the tallest civic center in Tokyo. It has been in use since 1994.

Early life and education Jahu Dewitt Miller was born in Cross River, New York on March 1, 1857 to Jahu and Phebe (Seymour) Miller. His father was a farmer and blacksmith.Vincent, p. 2 Miller attended public schools and in 1871 he entered the Collegiate Institute at Fort Edward, New York. Upon graduation, he immediately became a member of the faculty.Vincent, p. 3 Although known by his first name, Miller used his middle name professionally. Occupations Miller briefly worked as a freelance journalist and as a shipping clerk in a New York City mercantile. In 1880, he returned to teaching as \\"Professor of History and Mental Philosophy\\" at Pennington Seminary in Pennington, New Jersey.Vincent, p. 6-7 Miller was also a lay minister in the Methodist denomination, and his sermons were so popular that he left the pulpit for the lecture platform.Vincent, p. 9-10 Among his \\"popular lectures\\" were \\"The Uses of Ugliness\\", \\"Our Country's Possibilities and Perils\\", \\"The Self-Sufficiency of the Republic\\", and \\"The Reveries of a Bachelor\\".Vincent, p. 13 Miller had a very casual style of dressing and rarely wore a hat, which was very unusual for American men at the time. When he did wear a hat, it was usually his antiquated white beaver hat. His dress and his wit often led others to characterize him as a humorous lecturer, which he did not like. \\"I am not a humorous lecturer,\\" he stated, \\"Things present themselves to me in a certain light. I state them as I see them. For some reason or other people laugh. But I am not a humorous lecturer!\\"Quoted in Vincent, p. 22 Personal library Miller was an obsessive book collector, which began in his youth. About 1888, he started to appreciate books as works of art by collecting the works of William Pickering. Miller amassed a nearly-comprehensive collection of the works of John Baskerville. Although Miller was often heard to say \\"I care nothing for first editions\\", he owned many and compared first edition copies he owned to those that sold for high prices at auction. His biographer, Leon H. Vincent stated, \\"No one has heard him say that he cared nothing for his first edition of Boswell's Johnson. When news came of the splendid sum fetched by Gray's Elegy at the Hoe sale, Miller got out his copy for inspection and comment. A very good copy it was, and cost him nearly three dollars.\\"Vincent, p. 45 Throughout his life, Miller kept his collections in several locations and always traveled with many books. The bulk of his collection was kept in an unused country store at Carmel, New York where his sister was the \\"caretaker\\". In January 1902, this collection became a library at National Park Seminary, a girls' school in Forest Glen, Maryland, founded by his friends John and Vesta Cassedy.Vincent, p. 71 The library remained at National Park Seminary until the property was condemned by the U.S. Army during World War II, when the contents were dispersed at a public sale. The building was renovated in May 2008 as a single-family home. Death Miller was in good health until a month before his death. He became ill while attending a chautauqua in Boise, Idaho, and his subsequent appearances in California were canceled.Vincent, p. 144-145 Miller died in Boise on July 29, 1911 and was buried on August 7, 1911 in Cross River, New York.

History   Nunnery of St Mary: c. 1100‚Äì1539  The parish of St James, Clerkenwell, has had a long and sometimes lively history. The springs which give Clerkenwell its name are mentioned during the reign of Henry II. The parish clerks of London used to perform their mystery plays, plays based on Biblical themes, in the neighbourhood, sometimes in the presence of royalty. In approximately 1100 a Norman baron named Jordan Briset founded an Augustine nunnery dedicated to St Mary, which became wealthy and influential. It had a place of pilgrimage at Muswell Hill, and the parish kept an outlying tract of territory there until the nineteenth century.  Old Church of St James: 1540‚Äì1788  The old church of St James, Clerkenwell At the dissolution of the nunnery under Henry VIII its church, which by then seems to have acquired a second dedication to St James, was taken into use by its parishioners who had already been using a part of it for some considerable time. The site of the nunnery was granted to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, in 1540 but the freehold of the church passed through various hands until it was conveyed in 1656 to trustees on behalf of the parishioners, who at the same time obtained the right to appoint the vicar. Unlike other parishes, they retained it after the Restoration of 1660. Elections of vicars were held, with all the excitement and paraphernalia of parliamentary elections, right down to the early years of the twentieth century, and a distinctly Low Church tradition was thereby established. This did not prevent a long struggle in the latter years of the eighteenth century with Selina, Countess of Huntingdon. This strong-minded and evangelical lady had taken over a building in the parish called Spa Fields Chapel, and insisted on appointing her own chaplains to preach there. The vicar was furious, and his action against her in the ecclesiastical courts was the cause of her secession from the Church of England. In 1596, the playwright George Peele was buried in the church. In 1623 the steeple fell down twice but was eventually successfully rebuilt. Pocahontas and John Rolfe's son, Thomas Rolfe, married Elizabeth Washington here in September 1632. They had a daughter named Anne a year later. Elizabeth died shortly after Anne‚Äôs birth. Two years later, he returned to Jamestown, Virginia, leaving his daughter with his cousin, Anthony Rolfe. It is believed that, in 1632, the playwright Thomas Dekker was buried in the church. In 1641, the playwright Thomas Heywood was buried in the church. In 1737, Matthew King, accomplice of Dick Turpin, was buried at St James, aged 25, after he was allegedly accidentally shot by Turpin during a robbery.  New Church of St James: 1792‚Äìpresent  The new church of St James, Clerkenwell, 1806 By 1788 the old church, which was a medley of seventeenth and eighteenth century sections in various styles grafted onto the remains of the mediaeval nunnery church, presented an appearance of picturesque and dilapidated muddle. In that year an act of parliament was passed for the rebuilding of the church, the money to be provided by the sale of annuities. The architect was a local man, James Carr, and he produced a building which is pre-eminently a preaching-house but with carefully planned and harmonious detail clearly influenced by Wren and Gibbs. The new church was dedicated by Bishop Beilby Porteus in 1792. The upper galleries were added in 1822 for the children of the Sunday-School, founded in 1807 and still flourishing; the back parts of the upper galleries were for the use of the poor. The tower and spire were restored in 1849 by W. P. Griffith, and Sir Arthur Blomfield restored the church and rearranged the ground floor in 1882; both works were done very well. Inside, a noteworthy feature is the curved acoustic wall at the west end. The wall at the east end originally had painted panels in the Venetian window frame; the stained glass in the east windows is by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, 1863. The organ was built in 1792 by George Pike England to replace the one by Richard Bridge, which he took in part exchange. The new organ had three manuals, toe pedals and a Spanish mahogany case. This, together with much of England's pipe work, still survives. The rococo detail is noteworthy, especially the carved drapery over the pipes. The organ was rebuilt by Noel Mander of Mander Organs in 1978, returning to the original style after some drastic alterations made in 1928. It now has 2 manuals and pedals and 22 speaking stops. There is a fine peal of eight bells in the tower, dating from 1791, though all the bells were recast in 1928. The most noteworthy vicar of the nineteenth century was the Rev. Robert Maguire, a prolific writer of Protestant pamphlets, who had enjoyed a peculiarly stormy and exciting election. He was responsible for much work on the fabric of the church and some rearrangement of the interior. The crypt was used for burials, but early in the twentieth century 300 coffins were moved and stored under the main West entrance. The crypt was then excavated and equipped to form a large hall. The new hall was opened by the Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig- Holstein in 1912. It was later remodelled and opened by the Rt Revd Richard Chartres, Bishop of Stepney, on 18 June 1994. The latest work created a dedicated youth space in part of the crypt and was opened by Rt Rev John Sentamu, Bishop of Stepney, on 19 December 1999. During the 20th century, the parish of St John, which had been carved out of St James's in 1721, was reunited with it, as was the parish of St Peter. The latter had been established in 1869 for the Smithfield Martyrs Memorial Church of that name; the present church contains a memorial to the Martyrs as a commemoration of St Peter's, which suffered heavy war damage in 1941 and was finally demolished in 1955. The parish church of St John was a remnant of the priory of St John, which is now the headquarters of the Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, and the church became the chapel of the Order. Frontispiece of The European Magazine, vol. 36, 1 August 1799 A print of the church, based on a drawing by Samuel Rawle, featured as the frontispiece of The European Magazine, volume 36, published 1 August 1799.  Historical features  The current church retains many reminders of its past. * The communion table and communion rail are part of the original furnishings. Both are curved toward the west. The table is of mahogany, inlaid with box wood, decorated with plumes of feathers and a dove ‚Äì the emblem of the Holy Spirit. * A wooden figure of St James which stood over the poor box in the former church is now over the west door of the Nave. * There are several monuments from the old church. These were neglected at the rebuilding, but during the nineteenth century were rescued by the church wardens and set up in the church and porch. ** In the church are the following: *** A wall tablet to William Wood, a noted archer who died in 1691 and whose memorial at the end of the south aisle was restored by the Toxophilite Society in 1791. *** A large wall tablet with armorials to Elizabeth, Countess Dowager of Exeter, at the east end of the south aisle, it records her illustrious lineage and the brilliant marriages she made for her three daughters. Next to her lies Mico Wagstaff, ironmonger. *** A sixteenth-century brass to John Bell, Bishop of Worcester, 1539‚Äì43, who lived in retirement in Clerkenwell and was buried in the old church in 1556. ** Among the memorials in the porch are those to: *** Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, and a well-known preacher and writer, who died in 1714 at his daughter's house in the parish; there is a floor slab to him under the communion table. The wall tablet was executed by Robert Hartshorne, to a design by Edward Stanton. *** Henry Penton, who died in 1714: his grandson of the same name developed the area now known as Pentonville. *** Thomas Crosse and his wife, 1712, a sculpture by Roubiliac. * The porch also houses the benefaction boards, recording the numerous charities still being distributed among the elderly folk of Clerkenwell and going back to the reign of Elizabeth I, when the parish was a fashionable place to live. * Over the west door are the royal arms of George III. Made of Coade stone and dated 1792, they were formerly over the reredos. * The church contains a memorial to the victims of the \\"Fenian Conspiracy\\", an escape plot from the nearby Clerkenwell Prison which killed 12 and injured 120. * The church contains a modern memorial to 66 martyrs, from 1400 to 1558, of the Smithfield Fires in a blocked-up doorway that is referred to as the Martyrs Door. Many images of the current church, including much of the internal detail, may be found here.  Present day The Rev. Pete Nicholas and the Rev. Mark Jackson were licensed by the Bishop of Stepney to Saint James Clerkenwell in 2018. The Bishop‚Äôs Mission Order initiative ‚ÄòInspire London‚Äô that the two had initiated in 2013 was combined with Saint James Clerkenwell to form the church in its current form Inspire Saint James Clerkenwell. Inspire Saint James Clerkenwell‚Äôs vision is to be a united and diverse community inspiring London with the good news of Jesus Christ. The three keys values that underpin its ministry are Biblical Preaching, Engaging the Heart and Connecting with Culture. The church maintains its Evangelical and Reformed tradition within the Church of England. It is committed to its parish and the local area as well as having a vision for serving the wider city of London. Resources and talks from Inspire Saint James Clerkenwell, as well as information about the life of the church, can be found on their website.  The Crypt  The Crypt underneath the Church was converted to be a usable space in 1912 and is split into a main room, a side room and a kitchen. The main room, The Crypt, has a vaulted brick ceiling and parquet flooring and is used by the church itself and the local community. Because of its magnificent architecture and location in the heart of London the crypt is a popular venue for exhibitions, film shoots, parties, conferences and wedding receptions. Booking information can be found here.

Taxonomic opinions have differed about this species, and to complicate matters Crataegus macrosperma and various species of C. series Populneae have frequently been misidentified as C. iracunda, leading to differing statements about its geographic range. The 2015 Flora of North America considers its range to be in the southeastern U.S., restricted to the US states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Crataegus iracunda is a branching shrub or small tree rarely more than in height, sprouting from the roots and thus forming large thickets. Leaves are egg-shaped, pointed at the tips, with teeth along the edges. Flowers come in flat-topped arrays. Fruit is red or orange, sometimes with green blotches.

The two fall in love and Moore ends up having his child. Terry has to face the possibility of losing her baby, but she takes up the fight to keep the baby.

The periodic cat-fights among the prisoners are certainly nasty, but they don't contribute to any overall continuity. ...Amy Madigan, a newcomer who plays Terry, makes her a raw-boned, angry tomboy at first; only gradually is the child-crying-out-for-help side of the character revealed. Miss Madigan seems potentially a tough, unusual actress, but Mr. Peerce keeps her at full throttle so much of the time that the performance loses its force. Her wildeyed, furious mannerisms, at first quite arresting, become familiar long before they should. Miss Madigan isn't alone in this; all of the film's characters have a tendency to come on too strong and then wear out their welcomes.\\" Awards *Nominee New Actress of the Year - Golden Globes (Amy Madigan) DVD Love Child was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on June 1, 2010 via the Warner Archive DVD-on-demand service available through Amazon.

Other nearby Romano-British settlements at Ullington, Blakes Hill and Littleton Pastures have been documented, and all were thought to be in continuous occupation until the late 4th century. Archeological evidence suggests the area was completely abandoned after the end of the Roman occupation of Britain.

Marcus first ruled jointly with his adoptive brother, Lucius Verus. They shared the throne until Lucius' death in 169. Marcus was succeeded by his son Commodus, who had been made co-emperor in 177. Under Marcus, Rome fought the Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 161‚Äì66 and the Marcomannic Wars. The so- called Antonine plague occurred during his reign. In the last years of his rule, Marcus composed his personal writings on Stoic philosophy known as Meditations. Sources Marble statue of Marcus Aurelius in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen The major sources for the life and rule of Marcus are patchy and frequently unreliable. The biographies contained in the Historia Augusta claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century, but are in fact written by a single author (referred to here as \\"the biographer of the Historia Augusta\\") from the later 4th century (c. 395). The later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers consist largely of lies and fiction, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources (Marius Maximus or Ignotus) are much more reliable.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 229‚Äì30. The thesis of single authorship was first proposed in H. Dessau's \\"√úber Zeit und Pers√∂nlichkeit der Scriptoes Historiae Augustae\\" (in German), Hermes 24 (1889), pp. 337ff. For Marcus Aurelius' life and rule, the biographies of Hadrian, Pius, Marcus and Lucius Verus are largely reliable, but those of Aelius Verus and Avidius Cassius are partly invented.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 230. On the HA Verus, see Barnes, pp. 65‚Äì74. A body of correspondence between Marcus Aurelius' tutor Marcus Cornelius Fronto and various Antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166.Mary Beard, \\"Was He Quite Ordinary?\\", London Review of Books 31:14 (23 July 2009), accessed 15 September 2009; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 226. Marcus' own Meditations offer a window on his inner life, but are largely undateable, and make few specific references to worldly affairs.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 227. The main narrative source for the period is Cassius Dio, a Greek senator from Bithynian Nicaea who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books. Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 228‚Äì29, 253. Some other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician Galen on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of Aelius Aristides on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the Digest and Codex Justinianus on Marcus' legal work.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 227‚Äì28. Inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 228. Accession of Marcus and Lucius (161) Lucius Verus, Aurelius' co-emperor from 161 to Verus' death in 169, British Museum At the death of Antoninus Pius, Marcus was effectively sole ruler of the Empire. The formalities of the position would follow: The senate would soon grant him the name Augustus and the title imperator, and he would soon be formally elected as Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the official cults. Marcus made some show of resistance: the biographer of the Historia Augusta writes that he was \\"compelled\\" to take imperial power.HA Marcus vii.5, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 116. This may have been a genuine horror imperii, \\"fear of imperial power\\". Marcus, with his preference for the philosophic life, found the imperial office unappealing. His training as a Stoic, however, had made the choice clear. It was his duty.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 116. Birley takes the phrase horror imperii from HA Pert. xiii.1 and xv.8. Although Marcus shows no personal affection for Hadrian (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his Meditations), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man's succession plans.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 156. Thus, although the senate planned to confirm Marcus Aurelius alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius, the son of Hadrian's long deceased chosen heir L. Aelius, received equal powers.HA Verus iii.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 48‚Äì49, 116; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 156. The senate accepted, granting Lucius the imperium, the tribunician power, and the name Augustus.HA Verus iv.1; Marcus 7.5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 116. Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus Aurelius' family name, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 116‚Äì17. It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors. In spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more auctoritas, or \\"authority\\", than Verus. He had been consul once more than Verus, he had shared in Pius' administration, and he alone was Pontifex Maximus. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior. As the biographer of the Historia Augusta wrote, \\"Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.\\"HA Verus iv.2, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 117, 278 n.4. Immediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the Castra Praetoria, the camp of the Praetorian Guard. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as imperatores, and like every new emperor since Claudius, promised the troops a special donative.HA Marcus vii.9; Verus iv.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 117‚Äì18. This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 sesterces (5,000 denarii) per capita, more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years' pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors.HA Marcus vii.9; Verus iv.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 117‚Äì18. \\"twice the size\\": Richard Duncan-Jones, Structure and Scale in the Roman Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 109. The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 118. Pius' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer of the Historia Augusta, \\"elaborate\\".HA Marcus vii.10, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 118, 278 n.6. If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius, while his spirit would rise to the gods' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Pius' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A flamen, or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Pius, now Divus Antoninus. Pius' remains were laid to rest in Hadrian's mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus' children and of Hadrian himself.HA Marcus vii.10‚Äì11; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 118. The temple Pius had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda. In accordance with his will, Pius' fortune passed on to Faustina.HA Pius xii.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 118‚Äì19. (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune. Indeed, at his accession, he transferred part of his mother's estate to his nephew, Ummius Quadratus.HA Marcus vii.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 119.) Faustina was three months pregnant at her husband's accession. During the pregnancy she dreamed of giving birth to two serpents, one fiercer than the other.HA Commodus i.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 119. On 31 August she gave birth at Lanuvium to twins: T. Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus.HA Commodus. i.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 119. Aside from the fact that the twins shared Caligula's birthday, the omens were favorable, and the astrologers drew positive horoscopes for the children.HA Commodus. i.4, x.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 119. The births were celebrated on the imperial coinage.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 119, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 155ff.; 949ff. Early rule Bust of Marcus Aurelius from Probalinthos, Attica, Greece, c. 161 AD, now in the Louvre, Paris Soon after the emperors' accession, Marcus' eleven- year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Verus (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle).HA Marcus vii.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 118. At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 118, citing Werner Eck, Die Organisation Italiens (1979), pp. 146ff. Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their civiliter (\\"lacking pomp\\") behavior. The emperors permitted free speech, evinced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer of the Historia Augusta wrote, \\"No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.\\"HA Marcus viii.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 119; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 157. Marcus replaced a number of the empire's major officials. The ab epistulis Sextus Caecilius Crescens Volusianus, in charge of the imperial correspondence, was replaced with Titus Varius Clemens. Clemens was from the frontier province of Pannonia and had served in the war in Mauretania. Recently, he had served as procurator of five provinces. He was a man suited for a time of military crisis.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 122‚Äì23, citing H.G. Pfalum, Les carri√®res procuratoriennes √©questres sous le Haut- Empire romain I‚ÄìIII (Paris, 1960‚Äì61); Suppl√©ment (Paris, 1982), nos. 142; 156; Eric Birley, Roman Britain and the Roman Army (1953), pp. 142ff., 151ff. Marcus' former tutor Lucius Volusius Maecianus, who had been prefectural governor of Egypt at Marcus' accession, was recalled, made senator, and appointed prefect of the treasury (aerarium Saturni). He was made consul soon after.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 123, citing H.G. Pfalum, Les carri√®res procuratoriennes √©questres sous le Haut-Empire romain I‚ÄìIII (Paris, 1960‚Äì61); Suppl√©ment (Paris, 1982), no. 141. Fronto's son-in-law, Aufidius Victorinus, was appointed governor of Upper Germany.HA Marcus viii.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 123, citing W. Eck, Die Satthalter der germ. Provinzen (1985), pp. 65ff. Fronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120, citing Ad Verum Imperator 1.3.2 (= Haines 1.298ff). The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: \\"There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.\\"Ad Antoninum Imperator iv.2.3 (= Haines 1.302ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 119. Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120. Tiber Island seen at a forty-year high-water mark of the Tiber, 13 December 2008 Lucius was less esteemed by Fronto than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120, citing Ad Verum Imperator i.1 (= Haines 1.305). Marcus told Fronto of his reading‚ÄîCoelius and a little Cicero‚Äîand his family. His daughters were in Rome with their great- great-aunt Matidia; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. He asked Fronto for \\"some particularly eloquent reading matter, something of your own, or Cato, or Cicero, or Sallust or Gracchus‚Äîor some poet, for I need distraction, especially in this kind of way, by reading something that will uplift and diffuse my pressing anxieties.\\"Ad Antoninum Imperator iv.1 (= Haines 1.300ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120. Marcus Aurelius' early reign proceeded smoothly. He was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.HA Marcus viii.3‚Äì4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120. Soon, however, he would find he had many anxieties. It would mean the end of the felicitas temporum (\\"happy times\\") that the coinage of 161 had proclaimed.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120, citing H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 841; 845. In the spring of 162, the Tiber flooded over its banks, destroying much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention.HA Marcus viii.4‚Äì5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120. In other times of famine, they are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.HA Marcus xi.3, cited in Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 278 n.16. Fronto's letters continued through Marcus' early reign. Fronto felt that, because of Marcus' prominence and public duties, lessons were more important now than they had ever been before. He believed Marcus was \\"beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence\\".Ad Antoninum Imperator i.2.2 (= Haines 2.35), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 128. Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: \\"Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of Cleanthes and Zeno, yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape.\\"De eloquentia i.12 (= Haines 2.63‚Äì65), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 128. The early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: Marcus was beloved by the people of Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished.Ad Antoninum Imperator i.2.2 (= Haines 2.35); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 127‚Äì28. Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at Cyzicus. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: \\"not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech\\". Fronto was hugely pleased.Ad Antoninum Imperator i.2.4 (= Haines 2.41‚Äì43), tr. Haines; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 128. War with Parthia, 161‚Äì166 Statue of Marcus Aurelius from Gabii (Italy), late 2nd-century AD, now in the Louvre, Paris In 161, Vologases IV of Parthia invaded the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled its king, and installed Pacorus, an Arsacid like himself.HA Marcus viii.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 121.HA Pius xii.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 114, 121.Event: HA Marcus viii.6; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 121.

The governor of Cappadocia, Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters was convinced by the prophet Alexander of Abonutichus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself.Lucian, Alexander 27; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 121.Lucian, Alexander 27; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 121‚Äì22. On Alexander, see: Robin Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), pp. 241‚Äì50. Severianus led his forces (perhaps the Ninth Legion of Hispania) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegeia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 278 n.19. After attempting to fight Chosrhoes, Severianus committed suicide, and his legion was massacred. The campaign had lasted only three days.Dio lxxi.2.1; Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda xxi, 24, 25; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 121‚Äì22. There were also threats of war in Britain, and in Raetia and Upper Germany, where the Chatti of the Taunus mountains had recently crossed into Roman territory.HA Marcus viii.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 122. Apparently having been given no military education by Pius, Marcus was unprepared. He had spent no part of his predecessor's twenty-three-year reign in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early careers.HA Pius viik.11; Marcus vii.2; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 103‚Äì04, 122.

The northern frontier was strategically weakened and its governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible.HA Marcus xii.13; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 123. M.

Surviving letters from Marcus to Fronto describe a holiday the emperor took in Etruria, at the costal resort town of Alsium, during which he was too anxious to relax.De Feriis Alsiensibus 1 (= Haines 2.3); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 126. Fronto encouraged Marcus Aurelius to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy),De Feriis Alsiensibus iii.4 (= Haines 2.9); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 126‚Äì27. He went so far as to write a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening, to help Marcus break his habit of spending his evenings working on judicial matters instead of relaxing.De Feriis Alsiensibus iii.6‚Äì12 (= Haines 2.11‚Äì19); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 126‚Äì27. Marcus, unable to take his former tutor's advise, wrote back: \\"I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off\\".De Feriis Alsiensibus iv, tr. Haines 2.19; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 127. Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material, and, to settle his unease over the course of the war, a long and considered letter, full of historical references.De bello Parthico 10 (= Haines 2.31), qtd. and tr. Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 127. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled De bello Parthico (On the Parthian War). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes, but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: \\"always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs\\".De bello Parthico 1‚Äì2 (= Haines 2.21‚Äì23).De bello Parthico 1 (= Haines 2.21), qtd. and tr.

Over the winter of 161‚Äì162, as more bad news arrived‚Äîa rebellion was brewing in Syria‚Äîit was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. It has been suggested that he was stronger and healthier than Marcus, and more suited to military activity.Dio lxxi.1.3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 123. Verus' biographer suggests ulterior motives, such as restraining his debaucheries, making him more thrifty, reforming his morals through the terrors of war, and helping him realize his role as emperor.HA Verus v.8; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 123, 125. Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and, in the summer of 162, Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city \\"demanded the presence of an emperor\\".HA Marcus viii.9, tr.

Marcus moved up the date; perhaps he was disturbed by stories of Verus' mistress, the low-born and beautiful Panthea.HA Verus vii.10; Lucian, Imagines 3; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 131. Cf. Lucian, Imagines, Pro Imaginibus, passim. Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 131; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 163. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father.HA Verus vii.7; Marcus ix.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 131. Civica was made comes Augusti, \\"companion of the emperors\\"; perhaps Marcus wanted him to watch over Lucius, the job Libo had failed at.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 131, citing Ann√© √âpigraphique 1958.15. Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer of the Historia Augusta says he told the senate he would); this did not happen.HA Verus vii.7; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 131. He only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east.HA Marcus ix.4; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 131.

In 163, the Parthians intervened in Osroene, a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia centered on Edessa, and installed their own king on its throne.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 130, 279 n. 38; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 163, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 169; Millar, Near East, p. 112. In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 130; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 162. Before the end of 163, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank.Fronto, Ad Verum Imperator ii.1.3 (= Haines 2.133); Astarita, 41; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 130; \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 162. Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town south-west of Edessa.Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 1098 ; Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 130. In 165, Roman forces moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, and Mannus, the king deposed by the Parthians, was re-installed.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 163, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 M 169. The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris.Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 15, 19; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 163. A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura.Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 20, 28; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 163, citing Syme, Roman Papers, vol. 5, pp. 689ff. By the end of the year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid Empire, one of Alexander the Great's successor kingdoms), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.HA Verus viii.3‚Äì4; Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 163. Birley cites R.H. McDowell, Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1935), pp. 124ff., on the date. Cassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 164.

Conclusion of the war and events at Rome, mid-160s‚Äì167 Most of the credit for the war's success must be ascribed to subordinate generals, the most prominent of which was C. Avidius Cassius, commander of III Gallica, one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of Cyrrhus. His father, Heliodorus, had not been a senator, but was nonetheless a man of some standing: he had been Hadrian's ab epistulis, followed the emperor on his travels, and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrian's reign. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the Seleucid kings.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 130, citing Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 A 1402f.; 1405; Astarita, passim; Syme, Bonner Historia-Augustia Colloquia 1984 (= Roman Papers IV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), ?). Cassius and his fellow commander in the war, Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166. After their consulships, they were made governors: Cassius, of Syria; Martius Verus, of Cappadocia.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", p. 164, citing Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat, pp. 24, 221. At Rome, Marcus Aurelius was occupied with family matters. Matidia, his great-aunt, had died. Her will was invalid under the lex Falcidia: Matidia had assigned more than three-quarters of her estate to non-relatives; her clients had convinced her to include them in codicils to her will. Matidia had never confirmed the documents, but, as she lay unconscious, her clients had sealed them in with the original, making them valid. It was an embarrassing situation. Fronto urged Marcus to push the family's case; Marcus demurred. He was going to consult his brother, who would make the final call.Ad Antoninum Imperator ii.1‚Äì2 (= Haines 2.94ff.); Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 132. The returning army carried with them a plague, afterwards known as the Antonine Plague, or the Plague of Galen, which spread through the Roman Empire between 165 and 180. The disease was a pandemic believed to have been either smallpoxConclusion by Haeser, pp. 24‚Äì33. or measles\\"There is not enough evidence satisfactorily to identify the disease or diseases\\" concluded J. F. Gilliam in his summary (1961) of the written sources, with inconclusive Greek and Latin inscriptions, two groups of papyri and coinage. but the true cause remains undetermined. The epidemic may have claimed the life of Lucius Verus, who died in 169. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian Dio Cassius, causing up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome, one quarter of those who were affected, giving the disease a mortality rate of about 25%.Dio Cassius, lxxii. 14.3‚Äì4; his book that would cover the plague under Marcus is missing; this later outburst was the greatest of which the historian had knowledge. The total deaths have been estimated at five million,\\"Past pandemics that ravaged Europe\\", BBC News, 7 November 2005 and the disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.Plague in the Ancient World Legal and administrative work, 161‚Äì180 Bust of Marcus Aurelius, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Like nearly all emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing petitions and hearing disputes‚Äîthat is, on matters of law.Fergus Millar, The Emperor in the Roman World, 31 BC ‚Äì AD 337 (London: Duckworth, 1977), p. 6 and passim.

Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced Marcus Nonius Macrinus. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure Tiberius Haterius Saturnius. Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when Marcus Iallius Bassus had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 133, citing Geza Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand (1977), Moesia Inferior: pp. 232 f.; Moesia Superior: pp. 234f.; Pannonia Superior: pp. 236f.; Dacia: pp. 245f.; Pannonia Inferior: pp. 251. Starting in the 160s, Germanic tribes and other nomadic people launched raids along the northern border, particularly into Gaul and across the Danube. This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes further east. A first invasion of the Chatti in the province of Germania Superior was repulsed in 162.McLynn, pp. 323‚Äì324. Far more dangerous was the invasion of 166, when the Marcomanni of Bohemia, clients of the Roman Empire since year 19, crossed the Danube together with the Lombards and other Germanic tribes.Bohec, p. 56. Soon thereafter, the Iranian Sarmatians attacked between the Danube and the Theiss rivers.Grant, p. 29. The Costoboci, coming from the Carpathian area, invaded Moesia, Macedonia and Greece. After a long struggle, Marcus Aurelius managed to push back the invaders. Numerous members of Germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like Dacia, Pannonia, Germany and Italy itself. This was not a new thing, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and Marcomannia, including today's Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Some Germanic tribes who settled in Ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.Dio lxxii.11.4-5; Birley, Marcus Aurelius Death and succession Head of Marcus Aurelius on a marble body originally made c. 41-54 AD during the reign of Claudius, Farnese Collection, Naples Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, in the city of Vindobona (modern Vienna), his son and successor Commodus accompanying him. He was immediately deified and his ashes were returned to Rome, and rested in Hadrian's mausoleum (modern Castel Sant'Angelo) until the Visigoth sack of the city in 410. His campaigns against Germans and Sarmatians were also commemorated by a column and a temple built in Rome.Kleiner, p. 230. Marcus Aurelius was able to secure the succession for Commodus, whom he had named Caesar in 166 and made co- emperor in 177, though the choice may have been unknowingly unfortunate; this decision, which put an end to the fortunate series of \\"adoptive emperors\\", was highly criticized by later historians since Commodus was a political and military outsider, as well as an extreme egotist with neurotic problems.Birley, \\"Hadrian to the Antonines\\", 186‚Äì191. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius' death is often held to have been the end of the Pax Romana. At the end of his history of Marcus Aurelius' reign, Cassius Dio wrote an encomium to the emperor, and described the transition to Commodus, to Dio's own times, with sorrow. > [Marcus] did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not > strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout > practically his entire reign. But for my part, I admire him all the more for > this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both > survived himself and preserved the empire. Just one thing prevented him from > being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his person > in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him. This matter must > be our next topic; for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to > one of iron and rust, as affairs did for the Romans of that day.‚Äì Cassius > Dio lxxi.36.3‚Äì4Tr. Cary, ad loc. It is possible that Marcus Aurelius chose Commodus simply in the absence of other candidates, or as a result of the fear of succession issues and the possibility of civil war. Michael Grant, in The Climax of Rome (1968), writes of Commodus: \\"The youth turned out to be very erratic or at least so anti- traditional that disaster was inevitable. But whether or not Marcus Aurelius ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrous around future successions.\\"Grant, p. 15. Writings First page of the 1792 English translation by Richard Graves While on campaign between 170 and 180, Marcus Aurelius wrote his Meditations in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The original title of this work, if it had one, is unknown. \\"Meditations\\" as well as others, including \\"To Himself\\" were adopted later. He had a logical mind and his notes were representative of Stoic philosophy and spirituality. Meditations is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty. The book was a favourite of Christina of Sweden, Frederick the Great, John Stuart Mill, Matthew Arnold, and Goethe. Modern figures such as Wen Jiabao and Bill Clinton are admirers of the book.Hays, xlix. It is not known how far Marcus Aurelius' writings were circulated after his death. There are stray references in the ancient literature to the popularity of his precepts, and Julian the Apostate was well aware of Marcus Aurelius' reputation as a philosopher, though he does not specifically mention the Meditations.Stertz, p. 434, citing Themistius, Oratio 6.81; HA Cassius iii.5; Aurelius Victor, De Caesaribus xvi.9. It survived in the scholarly traditions of the Eastern Church and the first surviving quotes of the book, as well as the first known reference of it by name (\\"Marcus' writings to himself\\") are from Arethas of Caesarea in the 10th century and in the Byzantine Suda (perhaps inserted by Arethas himself). It was first published in 1558 in Zurich by Wilhelm Xylander (ne Holzmann), from a manuscript reportedly lost shortly afterwards.Hays, xlviii‚Äìxlix. The oldest surviving complete manuscript copy is in the Vatican library and dates to the 14th century.Hadot, p. 22. Notes Citations References Ancient sources * Aelius Aristides.

Biography Gonne was the younger son of Henry and Grace Staveley Gonne, of Ringwood, Hampshire. He was educated at Westminster School, and then attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as a cadet. On 27 October 1916 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers. He was soon seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, being appointed a flying officer on 23 May 1917. Gonne was assigned to No. 54 Squadron, and flew Sopwith Pup no. A6215 to victory on 25 September and 18 October 1917, destroying Albatros D.IIIs on both occasions. His third victory came on 5 January 1918, driving down an enemy aircraft 'out of control'. On 9 January Gonne was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain. His fourth and fifth victories both came on 25 January, driving down an Albatros D.V, and sending a Rumpler C down in flames. His final tally was three enemy aircraft destroyed, two driven down out of control. Gonne was awarded the Military Cross on 1 March, and promoted to lieutenant on 27 April. After some months on home service, he returned to France at his own request to take part in the Allied offensive. Gonne was reported as missing on 8 August 1918; having last been seen flying over the Somme River at Brie, some 15 miles behind the German front lines. In The Times of 12 December 1918 it was reported that he had died in a German field hospital at Villers-Carbonnel. He is buried in Heath Cemetery in Harbonni√®res, France.

It was established over 100 years ago as a one-room schoolhouse, and today has over 250 students in 12 classrooms (K‚Äì5th). The school has a tradition of family involvement and activism that stretches back to the 19th century. In 2006, Peralta was one of six schools in California where African-American students scored an API that exceeded 800 on the state STAR test. In 2008, Peralta demonstrated that academic targets were achieved for all subgroups at the school. Since the early 1990 the Peralta staff, students, families and neighbors have been working to make the school a green oasis. Tons of asphalt have been removed and replaced with edible gardens, a small amphitheater, a new kindergarten play area, and a California natives garden. The gardens are teaching too, helping students to learn about healthy eating, science, and stewardship of the land. Families help maintain the gardens during monthly work days, which build community and give students a feeling of ownership and responsibility for their school. Peralta's gardens have been held up as local and regional models. Peralta is a community hub, with events and activities such as a community yardsale, walkathon and spring festival, Peralta in Bloom.

Born in Ghana and a naturalized citizen of the United States since 1997, she moved to the United States in the 1970s when she was in her early twenties to work as a secretary at the Embassy of Ghana in Washington, D.C., where she still works. Following the death of her uncle in 2008, she was selected as his successor through a series of traditional rituals. She is a devout Christian, and she lives in Silver Spring, Maryland. Life Bartels' husband, William Bartels, is a member of the Euro-African Bartels family, whose ancestor Cornelius Ludewich Bartels was Governor-General of the Dutch Gold Coast between 1798 and 1804, and whose son Carel Hendrik Bartels was the most prominent biracial slave trader on the Gold Coast in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. Since her accession, Bartels has spent several weeks each year in Ghana on the anniversary of her coronation. She is notably the village's first female chief; she plans to become a full-time ruler after her retirement from the embassy. \\"King\\" is the traditional title for the ruler of Otuam. Bartels, Otuam's first female King, prefers the title to \\"Queen.\\" She has stated, \\"Most of the time, a king is the one who has all the executive power to do things, while the queen is mostly in charge of the children's affairs and reporting to the king. So I really love this.\\" The residents of Otuam also traditionally address Bartels as \\"Nana,\\" which is an honorary title given to royalty and also to women with grandchildren. Bartels wakes every morning at 1 am to call Otuam in order to keep up with her regent and elders in order to carry out her duties as King. She also visits Otuam for a month every year. So far, Bartels has helped poor families pay school fees for their children, brought computers to classrooms, and helped provide Otuam with its first ambulance, as well as access to clean, running water. Since her retirement from the Ghanaian embassy in Washington, D.C., King Peggy has opened a travel agency providing informed tours of Ghana and supporting her many local improvements.

Weill, the chairman of the up-and-coming Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt, had been acquiring many of Wall Streets oldest and most venerable investment banking and brokerage firms. By 1973, Weill's firm was known as Hayden Stone, Inc. following the acquisition of Hayden, Stone & Co. Despite its strong retail brokerage business, Shearson's capital reserves were diminished and by 1974, it was clear that Shearson did not have sufficient capital to survive as an independent firm, opting to merge with Weill's better capitalized Hayden Stone, Inc.. The combined firm was renamed Shearson Hayden Stone, as Weill retained the Shearson brand, which was widely recognized as a major underwriter and brokerage.Shearson Lehman Brothers Company History. Funding Universe Weill's next major target in 1979 was another prominent investment bank, Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co., which like Shearson had been suffering financial difficulties and was looking for a potential acquiror. During Mothers Day Weekend 1979, Shearson and Loeb agreed to an $83 million all-stock merger to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades, with Weill assuming the position of CEO of the combined firm. At the time of the merger, Shearson Loeb Rhoades, with $260 million of combined assets and approximately $550 million of revenue, was among the largest investment banking houses. By most measures, Shearson became the second largest Merrill Lynch as the second largest brokerage firm in the U.S. although the merger with Loeb Rhoades was more notable for introducing a stronger investment banking business to Shearson.The Urge to Merge.

The Shearson name was finally abandoned in 1994 following Primerica's acquisition of Shearson from American Express.

Although the firm would operate as Shearson Loeb Rhoades for two years, the firm would ultimately be acquired in 1981 by American Express to form Shearson/American Express and three years later Shearson Lehman/American Express. History The firm was founded as Carl M. Loeb & Co. by father Carl M. Loeb and son John Langeloth Loeb Sr. in 1931, shortly after the onset of the Great Depression. Carl M. Loeb & Co. merged with Rhoades & Company, a white shoe Wall Street brokerage firm, in 1937 to form what became Loeb, Rhoades & Co.

Carl Loeb, who had built his personal wealth as president of American Metal Company resigned from the company and bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, at the urging of his son John in 1931. While on the New York Stock Exchange, he pushed through many reforms.Stack, Elizabeth. \\"Carl Morris Loeb.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified September 25, 2014. Three years after Loeb left American Metals, the company's stock was nearly worthless. Together with his son, Carl ran Loeb, Rhoades for its first 24 years, from 1931 until his death in 1955. John L. Loeb was a partner in the firm from 1931 to 1955 and following the death of his father became the senior partner, a role which he retained through 1977 when the firm was merged. In 1951, John Loeb became a governor of the New York Stock Exchange. In 1956, Loeb, Rhoades acquired a controlling interest in the Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company and sold its stake on December 31, 1958, a day before the Cuban Revolution. In 1973, Carl M. Mueller assumed management control of the firm before Loeb resumed his management responsibilities in the firm in 1977. Loeb oversaw the merger of Loeb, Rhoades with Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask to form Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. in January 1978 before handing over day to day control of the firm to his nephew, Thomas Kempner, a grandson of Carl Loeb who had joined the firm in 1950. The Hornblower merger turned out to be disastrous for Loeb, Rhoades. The two firms incurred significant costs attempting to merge their back office operations, both of which had issues prior to the merger. By the end of 1978, less than a year after the merger, the combined firm was losing millions of dollars. Through the 1960s and 1970s, Sanford I. Weill was acquiring brokerage firms and by 1979 was running Shearson Hayden Stone, the culmination of nearly a dozen acquisitions. By early 1979, Loeb, Rhoades, now known as Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. was suffering and looking for a potential acquiror.

Kempner in 1982 to focus on managing assets for the Loeb family, wealthy clientele and institutions. Kempner, a grandson of Carl M. Loeb, was the final chairman of Loeb, Rhoades, serving from 1978 until the sale of the company in 1979. Loeb Partners launched the Loeb Arbitrage Fund in 1988 as an investment vehicle for the Loeb family and other family office clients.

This includes electromechanical split-flap displays, vane displays, and flip-disc displays; all-electronic liquid-crystal displays, incandescent eggcrate displays, LED displays, and vacuum fluorescent displays; and even electric nixie tubes. There are several ways to form text for display. A segment display uses lines, while a dot-matrix display uses a grid of dots, and both of these are seen in LCD, LED, VFD, and vane/disc types. For split-flap displays, the characters or words are pre-printed, and for nixie tubes the shapes are also pre-formed. In any case, the display elements are controlled by electronics which activate them in the correct physical and temporal sequence to show the desired information. Text displays are used in everything from clocks (clock radios, wristwatches) to variable-message signs (departure boards, intelligent transportation systems), because until the late 2000s, they were (and in many cases still are) the least expensive for their purpose. Text display types LED text displays LED text displays refer to types that are specialized and limited to display of alpha-numeric characters. Most types display either one character or a group of characters. One character is generally displayed by a matrix of LEDs, or by a set of segments. Liquid-crystal display A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat panel display, electronic visual display, video display that uses the light modulating or polarizing properties of liquid crystals (LCs). LCs do not emit light directly. A character display type is limited to and specialized for display of alphanumeric characters. They are used in a wide range of applications, including computer monitors, television, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, signage, etc. They are common in consumer devices such as video players, gaming devices, clocks, watches, calculators, and telephones. The low electrical power consumption of LCDs enables them to be used in battery-powered electronic equipment. It is an electronically modulated optical device made up of any number of pixels filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source (backlight) or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome. The earliest discovery leading to the development of LCD technology, the discovery of liquid crystals, dates from 1888. By 2008, worldwide sales of televisions with LCD screens had surpassed the sale of CRT units. Eggcrate displays An eggcrate display is one older method of displaying an alphanumeric character. It consists of a matrix of incandescent light bulbs. A foam rubber mask with an array of holes surrounding the bulbs is attached to the display, causing it to resemble an egg crate. Some eggcrate displays use a complete 5√ó7 matrix for each digit, permitting the display of nearly all alphanumeric characters. Other types display only numeric characters and optionally a dollar sign. This type of eggcrate display is popularly used for sports scoreboards. Eggcrate displays have been used on many game shows to display contestants' scores and/or for countdown clocks because other types of displays, such as LED seven-segment displays, were prone to being washed out by bright studio lights. Though they continued to see extensive use well into the late 1990s, many shows began adopting LCDs in the 2000s. They have also been used as variable-message signs on highways, although they were later superseded by flip-disc, fiber optic, and eventually LED displays. Vane displays A vane display is an electro- mechanical type of 7-segment display. Unlike LED and VFD segmented displays, vane displays are composed of seven physical surfaces, typically painted white, but occasionally other colors, such as yellow or fluorescent green. If a segment is to be displayed as \\"off\\", it will be rotated so that its edge faces forward, with the painted surface pointing away and not visible. A segment that is to be displayed as \\"on\\" will be rotated so that the painted surface is shown.

A loose adaptation of the short story of the same name by H.P. Lovecraft, the film concerns a young female graduate student who is targeted by a man attempting to use her in an occult ritual taken from the Necronomicon. The screenplay was co-written by Curtis Hanson, while Roger Corman served as an executive producer on the film. The film's distributor, American International Pictures, had tentatively planned an adaptation of the Lovecraft story in 1963. Executive producer Corman hired Haller to direct, as he had previously directed several features for him, including Devil's Angels (1967). Though set in the fictional town of Arkham, Massachusetts, principal photography of The Dunwich Horror took place in and around Mendocino, California in the spring of 1969. The film marked Sandra Dee's first adult role, following the break in her contract with Universal Pictures, and she envisioned the picture as a major departure from the films she had appeared in as a child actor, in which she had been presented in a very wholesome way. The Dunwich Horror premiered in Chicago in January 1970, and screened throughout the country that year, as well as internationally. Critical response was divided, with some critics praising the film's technical elements and adaptation of the source material, while others felt the performances were ineffective, and the film generally mediocre. Despite this, some contemporary film scholars, such as Alain Silver, have championed the film as one of the best film adaptations of a Lovecraft literary work. Film historian Rob Craig similarly deemed it \\"one of the most overall successful adaptations of a Lovecraft source work ever committed to film.\\" Aesthetically, the film has been noted for its psychedelic imagery. Plot A woman groans and writhes with the pain of childbirth in a bedroom from a bygone era as two elderly women - who appear to be twins - and an elderly man watch. She is then led out of the room by the elderly man. Sandra Dee (center) as Nancy Wagner At the Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts, Dr. Henry Armitage has just finished a lecture on the local history and the very rare and priceless book known as the Necronomicon. He gives the book to his student Nancy Wagner to return to the library. She is followed by a stranger, who later introduces himself as Wilbur Whateley. Wilbur asks to see the book, and though it is closing time and the book is reputedly the only copy in existence, Nancy allows it under the influence of his hypnotic gaze. Wilbur's perusal of the book is cut short by Henry, who has researched Wilbur's family's sordid past. His warnings about the Whateley's go unheeded by Nancy, who decides to give Wilbur a ride back to Dunwich after he misses his bus, perhaps purposely. At a gas station on the outskirts of town, Nancy first encounters the ill-esteem in which the locals hold Wilbur. Once back at the Whateley house, she meets Old Whateley, Wilbur's grandfather. Wilbur disables her car, and then drugs Nancy. She decides under the influence of hypnosis and drugs to spend the weekend, and does not change her mind when Nancy's classmate Elizabeth arrives, with Henry, from Arkham the next morning. The duo does not abandon Nancy, however. They investigate further and discover that Wilbur's mother, Lavinia, is still alive and in an asylum. The town doctor, Dr. Cory informs Henry that Lavinia delivered twins when Wilbur was born, but one was stillborn, though he was not there for the delivery and never saw the body. The childbirth was very traumatic and Lavinia \\"lost her mind\\" during it, and nearly died. In the meantime, on the advice of the locals, Elizabeth enters the Whateley house looking for Nancy. She opens a locked door, and releases a creature which appears to be Wilbur's monstrous twin, who kills her and escapes. Upon Wilbur and Nancy's return, Old Whateley confronts them about the presence of Nancy's car, and in the ensuing argument, falls down the stairs and dies. Wilbur takes him to the local cemetery for a decidedly non-Christian burial, but the local townsfolk vociferously stop him. Wilbur's twin runs amok in Dunwich, killing several people. Lavinia dies in the asylum, looking much older than her 45 years. The Whateley estate burns down in a conflagration that may have to do with a pagan ritual. At the top of a coastal cliff, Wilbur prepares Nancy for sacrifice to bring back what he calls \\"The Old Ones.\\" Confronted by Armitage, Wilbur chants and calls down his demon father as his adversary chants reverse spells. Wilbur is struck by lightning in the ritual and falls in a ball of fire into the sea. Finally, the physically unharmed Nancy is escorted off the sacrificial altar by Armitage and Cory, who calm her by stating that the Whateley line has ended. Nancy is pregnant, presumably with Wilbur's ill-conceived child. Cast Analysis Film scholar Alain Silver considers The Dunwich Horror \\"the first geographical and architecturally apt transliteration of Lovecraft,\\" and \\"more appropriate to the source material and not just a revamping of old designs from Poe films.\\" Silver identifies one significant difference in the portrayal of Wilbur, who appears sensual and seductive in the film, whereas he is described in the story as \\"goatish\\" and uncharismatic. Scholar Rob Craig similarly notes that, in remaining true to the \\"spirit of the source work,\\" the film \\"may be, ironically, one of the most overall successful adaptations of a Lovecraft source work ever committed to film.\\" Several critics have noted that the film features prominent psychedelic imagery, particularly in its depiction of the disembodied energy that attacks several characters in the film. Production Development American International Pictures (AIP) originally announced a film version of Lovecraft's \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" in 1963. Originally, AIP had conceived an international co-production of the film between the United States and Italy. Daniel Haller, who was hired to direct, had previously directed several films for executive producer Roger Corman, including the motorcycle film Devil's Angels (1967). Commenting on the production, Haller noted that the production was partly inspired by the success of Rosemary's Baby (1968), but added: \\"We are not making a Gothic horror story. We want a much more contemporary image‚Äîone that will bring witchcraft and necromancy into an area of credibility, at least to some extent.\\" Casting Dean Stockwell and Sandra Dee in a publicity still for the film Sandra Dee was cast in the lead role of Nancy in April 1969, and paid $65,000 plus 5% of the profits. The role was Dee's first major part after the lapse of her years-long contract with Universal Pictures, and she saw it as a notable change of pace in her career. Dissatisfied with her previous work (Dee referred to her past 25 films with Universal as \\"all rotten\\"), she stated: \\"The reason I decided to do Dunwich was because I couldn't put the script down once I started reading it. I had read so many that I had to plow through, just because I promised someone. Even if this movie turns out be a complete disaster, I guarantee it will change my image.\\" However, Dee refused to be nude in the film's final sequence, which was written in the screenplay. Originally, Peter Fonda was cast in the role of Wilbur Whateley, but he backed out of the project and was replaced by Dean Stockwell. Both Stockwell and Dee were former child actors. This was the last film of actor Ed Begley, who died three months after its theatrical release. Filming Principal photography of The Dunwich Horror took place in Mendocino County, California, including the town of Little River, in the spring of 1969. Release Box office The Dunwich Horror premiered in Chicago at the McVicker's Theater on January 14, 1970. During its first week, it grossed $30,000. The following week, on January 21, it opened in Los Angeles before premiering in New York City on July 8 of that year. It premiered in London on September 20, 1970 as a double bill with The Oblong Box (1969). The film grossed $478,900 in 1970, per a May 12, 1971 report; however, a report in Variety from January 1971 indicated a total of $1,043,000 in U.S. and Canadian rentals. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on , with a weighted average rating of 4.5/10. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised the film, describing it as a \\"truly engrossing film of the supernatural that has been made with sensitivity and skill,\\" further commending its mood and atmosphere, as well as the performances of Dee and Stockwell. John Duvoli of Cinefantastique noted that the film \\"is not Lovecraftian, but it is good technical film-making,\\" also praising the special effects and score, but lambasting Dee's performances as ineffective. Ann Guarino of the New York Daily News awarded the film a favorable two-and-a-half stars out of four, noting that \\"Director Daniel Haller keeps interest high in the proceedings, but cannot avoid a letdown for, after all, he is dealing with the unbelievable.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times was less praiseful, writing that the film \\"has all the faults of Corman's various Poe adaptations (House of Usher, Pit and the Pendulum, The Masque of the Red Death), and very few of the virtues, with the exception of a beautifully Victorian interior set.\\" A reviewer for the Syracuse Post-Standard was similarly unimpressed, writing that \\"aside from being a good old-fashioned B-horror film, The Dunwich Horror has nothing startling to offer and will likely find its way to the late, late show.\\" The Tampa Tribunes Sharon Cohen felt the film's special effects were unremarkable, and commented that all of the principal cast seemed out of place: \\"Ed Begley looks uncomfortable in his role... Sandra Dee, as the virgin, looks like a chubby coed whom someone found on a Hollywood movie lot. And Dean Stockwell, with his curly long hair, looks vaguely like a warlock, but never manages to exude enough scary charm to be a convincing villain.\\" Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews gave the film a grade C, commending the film's eerie atmosphere, but criticized its uneven presentation, and found the film to be \\"dull and uninspiring.\\" Patrick Legare of AllMovie gave the film a mixed review, stating \\"Everything about the film -- the performers, the hair styles, the psychedelic imagery, the music -- has late-'60s tackiness written all over it, which leaves it very dated and not very Lovecraftian.\\" TV Guide awarded the film 2/4 stars, calling it \\"[a] fairly successful attempt at adapting H.P. Lovecraft for the screen.\\" Ain't It Cool News gave the film a mixed review, commending the film's first half and Stockwell's performance, but criticized the second half as kitsch and badly written, with the final confrontation being especially ridiculous. On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar stated that he disliked the changes to the film that departed from the original story, and criticized the performances, and underdeveloped characters. Sindelar also highlighted the handling of the film's monster as being effective and the only aspect he liked about the film. Home media The film was released on DVD by MGM on August 28, 2001. It was re-released again by the company as a part of a multi-disk set on September 11, 2001 and as a double feature with Die, Monster, Die! on September 20, 2005. Scream Factory released the film as a double feature on Blu-ray with Murders in the Rue Morgue (1971) in 2016.

Artists work with fields such as biology, robotics, physical sciences, experimental interface technologies (such as speech, gesture, face recognition), artificial intelligence, and information visualization. They address the research in many ways such as undertaking new research agendas, visualizing results in new ways, or critiquing the social implications of the research. The worldwide community has developed new kinds of art festivals, information sources, organizations, and university programs to explore these new arts. Hybrid arts is also the name of a non profit Arts education company in the United Kingdom. Set up in 2003 after a four-year development period to create a new species of training and arts engagement provider in the cultural industries...see Hybrid:arts Overview/ history of the term Many artists are responding to the central role scientific and technological research plays in contemporary culture. They are going beyond merely using technological tools and gadgets (e.g. computers) in their work to engage deeply with the processes of research. They are creating revolutionary art at the frontiers of scientific research. They see art as an independent zone of research that pursues areas of science and research ignored by mainstream academic disciplines. They are developing technologies that would be rejected by the marketplace but are nonetheless culturally critical. They are pursuing inquiries that are seen as too controversial, too wacky, too improbable, too speculative for regular science and technology. Their theoretical orientation ranges from celebration of human curiosity to critique of science's arrogance. They enter into the processes in research at all stages: setting research agendas, development of research processes, visualization, interpretations of findings, and education of the public. There has been some confusion over the last years of what to call this kind of art that crosses so many disciplines. It is descended from computer and internet art but reaches out to cover many new disciplines. Ars Electronica, which is considered one of leading world organizations concerned with experimental arts, decided three years ago to create a new category to encompass these kinds of arts. Every year they host an international competition for artists working in these experimental fields. They decided to use the name 'Hybrid Arts'. The worldwide community of artists, theorists, and journalists interested in this art are increasingly using this term. Here is a quote from their web site that offers their definition and a preliminary list of kinds of art covered. > The ‚ÄúHybrid Art‚Äù category is dedicated specifically to today‚Äôs hybrid and > transdisciplinary projects and approaches to media art.

New educational programs have been developed. Books have been written. Sample of the research fields addressed in hybrid arts -Genetics, Bioengineering, stem cells, proteomics -Art and Biology of Living Systems: microorganisms, plants, animals, ecology -Human Biology: the body, bionics, body manipulation, brain & body processes, body imaging, and medicine -Physical Sciences: particle physics, atomic energy, geology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, space science, nanotechnology, materials science -Kinetics, Electronics, Robotics: physical computing, ubiquitous computing, mixed reality -Alternative Interfaces: motion, gesture, touch, facial expression, speech, wearable computing, 3-d sound, and VR -Code: algorithms, software art, genetic art, A-life, artificial intelligence -Information Systems: databases, surveillance, RFID/barcodes, synthetic cinema, information visualization Telecommunications: telephone, radio, telepresence, web art, mobiles, locative media Festivals, shows, conferences related to hybrid arts Since much of the art does not fit into historical categories such as painting or sculpture, many museums and art festivals did not show the work. Curators who were interested created new kinds of festivals, competitions, museums and shows to present the work. Examples include Ars Electronica (note especially Interactive and Hybrid priz competitions. ISEA (International symposium of Electronic Arts), V2 - DEAF (Dutch Electronic Arts Festival), VIDA - Art & Artificial Life International Competition. Ars Electronica offers a festival each year that addresses transdisciplinary themes. Both artists and scientists are invited to speak at the conferences. Recent exhibitions focused on themes such as New Sex, Simplicity and Privacy. Organizations, information sources, art/science collaboration support, educational programs The hybrid arts community also established organizations and information sources to promote, disseminate, and interpret these new art activities. There are hundreds of such organizations of which a few examples are offered here. The external links show where to get more information. The Journal Leonardo published by MIT Press has a 40-year history of ‚Äòpromoting and documenting work at the intersection of the arts, sciences, and technology, and‚Ä¶ encouraging and stimulating collaboration between artists, scientists, and technologists.‚Äô The organization also has web sites, abstract services, and collaborates with other organizations in presenting conferences. The website We Make Money Not Art covers media/research conferences, interviews artists/researchers, and discusses developments in various fields from activism and biology to surveillance and wearables. Other organizations offer public events and facilitate the process of artists collaborating with researchers. For example, The Arts Catalyst in the UK seeks to ‚Äòextend the practice of artists engaging with scientific processes, facilities and technologies in order to reveal and illuminate the social, political and cultural contexts that brought them into being‚Äô through public symposia, exhibitions, and commissions. SymbioticA in Australia is an ‚Äòartistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning and critique of life sciences.‚Äô It ‚Äòprovides an opportunity for researchers to pursue curiosity-based explorations free of the demands and constraints associated with the current culture of scientific research.‚Äô The arts lab is sponsored by the medicine department of a university. Other examples include the Art and Genomics Centre(NL), the LABoral Centro de Arte y Creaci√≥n Industrial (ES) and Artists in Labs (CH) program. New forms of educational programs are being established at universities around the world. Students are expected to master topics in art, media, and research disciplines. For example, the U of Washington‚Äôs DXArts program offers a ‚Äòcreative research convergence zone for intrepid artists and scholars‚Äô who seek to reach out beyond the arts. The Conceptual/Information Arts (CIA) is the \\"experimental program within the Art Department at San Francisco State University dedicated to preparing artists and media experimentors to work at the cutting edge of science and technology\\". Courses cover topics such as art & biology, robotics, locative media, and physical computing. Further reading Kac, Eduardo. Signs of Life: Bio Art and Beyond.

The act ceased to be in force with the passing of the Statute Law Revision Act 1973.\\"Nauru Island Agreement Act 1919\\", ComLaw. Summary Due to the League of Nations mandate placing Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand in control of Nauru, it was necessary to construct an agreement on how the island was to be administered. Under the agreement, Nauru would be run by an administrator, which would be selected by the Australian Government for the first five years, and after that, selected in a way to be later decided. The act also required that a Board of Commissioners was to be formed comprising one member from each nation that was part of the agreement. The Board of Commissioners was given title to the phosphate deposits on the island, and any \\"land, buildings, plant, and equipment on the island used in connexion with the working of the deposits\\"; however remuneration was to be given to the previous owners. The act prohibited the supply of phosphate from Nauru to any country except Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom unless the entire Board of Commissioners agreed to the sale. For the first five years of the administration, provided that the phosphate was intended for agricultural use in the country receiving it, the United Kingdom and Australia would each receive 42% of the phosphate produced, whereas New Zealand would receive 16%. The figures were to be readjusted every five years.

A weather watch, on the other hand, typically refers to an alert issued to indicate that conditions are favorable for the development of dangerous weather patterns, although the dangerous weather conditions themselves are not currently present. Australia The Bureau of Meteorology is responsible for issuing weather warnings in Australia. The Bureau's warnings can be separated into severe thunderstorm warnings and severe weather warnings. Severe thunderstorm warnings are issued when either a severe thunderstorm is reported or if existing thunderstorms are expected to become severe. Severe weather warnings are issued when severe weather is occurring or expected in an area, which are not solely related to severe thunderstorms.  Canada  In Canada, governmental weather warnings and watches are issued by the Environment Canada. Environment Canada defines an advisory as \\"an alert to cover a wide array of deteriorating weather conditions,\\" a watch as \\"when conditions favour that severe weather forming\\" and a warning as \\"severe weather is actually occurring or is imminent.\\" . Additionally, Environment Canada breaks down weather alerts based upon the specific type of hazardous weather. These alerts are regionally issued throughout Canada and include, but are not limited to, winter storms, extreme temperature(including tornadoes), wind, tsunami, tropical cyclones and extreme precipitation amounts. New Zealand MetService is the National Meteorological Service of New Zealand, and is designated by the Minister of Transport to provide New Zealand's authorised meteorological warning service.Meteorological Services Act 1990 MetService issues Severe Weather Outlooks, Watches and Warnings under a Code of Practice that enables others to distribute this information in the national interest. Weather Warning Criteria are published on its website. Like the United States NWS, MetService breaks down weather warnings and watches based on the specific type of hazardous weather ‚Äì heavy rain, heavy snow, severe gales, and other weather likely to cause significant disruption to the general public or specific industry groups. MetService also provides Severe Thunderstorm Outlooks, Watches and Warnings to deal with heavy rain and strong wind gusts caused by thunderstorms, as well as large hail and damaging tornadoes. Philippines In the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issues rainfall advisories, thunderstorm adcisories, gale warnings, flood warnings and tropical cyclone warning signals. Sweden The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute has developed its own warning level terminology. Class 1 means forecast of weather that can mean some risks and disturbances to transport and other parts of society. Class 2 is for weather that can mean danger, damage and larger disturbances. Class 3 is for weather that can mean big danger, serious damage and major disturbances. This can refer to many types of weather related events such as wind, flooding, snow, forest fires etc. Sweden does not have as severe weather as some other countries, so class 3 events in Sweden would normally not cause very large international headlines. United Kingdom The Met Office, the United Kingdom's national weather service, does not issue separate weather warnings and watches, but has an analogous system of flash warnings and advance warnings that serve the same general role of weather warnings and weather watches, respectively. Other official meteorological departments may use similar systems but use different terms. The Met Office and other weather services have three colour coded warning levels: * Yellow: Be aware. Possible travel delays, or the disruption of your day-to-day activities. * Amber: Be prepared. Could cause road and rail closures, interruption to power and the potential risk to life and property. * Red: Take action. Widespread damage, travel and power disruption and risk to life is likely. Avoid dangerous areas. Thunderstorm warnings both Severe and Watch are also issued as of 2018. United States In the United States, governmental weather warnings and watches are issued by the National Weather Service, which is itself a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The NWS defines a watch as \\"the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event [increasing] significantly, but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain\\" and a warning as \\"hazardous weather or hydrologic event [that] is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurring\\" . Additionally, the NWS breaks down weather warnings and watches based upon the specific type of hazardous weather. These warnings and watches include, but are not limited to, flooding, severe local storms, tropical cyclones, and winter storms.

It was at one time the largest British machine tool builder.. History The business was founded in 1888 when Alfred Herbert and William Hubbard purchased for ¬£2,375 a small engineering business in Coventry. Herbert & Hubbard initially made boilers and steam engines. The firm, in Roderick Floud's paraphrasing of Herbert,. \\"came into machine tool production by accident when Alfred Herbert secured the agency for a French patent of great value in the manufacture of tubes for the fast expanding cycle trade in Coventry. On the basis of his profits from this patent the company began to make machine tools for the cycle trade.\\" In 1894 Hubbard was bought out and the business continued as Alfred Herbert Ltd focusing on machine tools. The number of employees rose from 180 in 1897 to 1,400 by 1908.DR. A. SHADWELL, Special Articles. Selected British Industries, The Times, 4 March 1908 A Herbert Lathe on display in Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. Regarding the differences (real or supposed) between American and British practice in the latter half of the 19th century, Floud. said that Herbert was \\"the [British] firm often held up as an example of the use of American techniques\\" [which sometimes emphasised focus on a narrow range of machines by any one builder] but that even Herbert \\"rejected the idea that the firm should specialize in a few types of machinery\\" [to the exclusion of a diverse mix of products]. He quoted Herbert as saying that \\"the cycle business, which was our principal customer, required in those days a variety of machines, and not many of them of one kind.\\" The firm was known for technical excellence. and competed well against other brands, especially in turret lathes., citing Carden 1909‚Äì1910, p. 225. The foreign-sales efforts of the Herbert firm are touched on in Floud's discussion of machine tool exports.. In 1899 a foundry was built at Edgwick where most of the Company's operations were subsequently based.Alfred Herbert at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography During the first half of the twentieth century it became one of the largest machine tool manufacturers in the world.. By the 1930s Alfred Herbert Limited was making profits around ¬£600,000 (2011: ¬£) . The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in March 1944 and the following year described its business as \\"Machine Tool Makers, Importers and Factors, and Mechanical Engineers etc\\". The main works covered 22 acres in Coventry and the company had operations in Argentina, France, India, Australia and \\"in normal times\\", Italy.Display Advertising: Alfred Herbert Limited The Times, 30 October 1945 It acquired Sigma Instruments in 1948. In 1975, following sustained losses, the company asked the National Enterprise Board to invest ¬£25 million in the business to provide for modernisation and to reduce borrowings.. The Company was then renamed Herbert Ltd. In the late 1970s there was an escalation of machine tool imports into the United Kingdom that left the Company behind.. The business was acquired by Tooling Investments in 1980 but then went into receivership in 1982.

Peru has some of the greatest biodiversity in the world. It belongs to the select group of mega diverse countries because of the presence of the Andes, Amazon Rainforest, and the Pacific Ocean. It has the fourth-most tropical forests of any country and the ninth-most forest area. Natural Protected Areas The Constitution of Peru of 1993 recognized the natural resources and ecosystem variety of its country as a heritage. In 1900, the National System of Natural Areas that are protected by the Peruvian Government (SINANPE) was created. This entity depends on the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA). They also created a map of protection and preservation of historical - cultural heritage and nature. This map has 49 Natural Areas (10% of the country surface) that are preserved by the Government: 8 National Parks, 8 National Reservations, 6 National Sanctuaries, 3 Historical Sanctuaries, 4 National Forests, 6 Protection Forests, 1 Communal Reservation, 2 Hunting enclosed lands and 11 Reserved Zones. National Parks are places where the wild flora and fauna are protected and preserved. Natural resources exploitation and human settlements are forbidden. Peru has over 53 natural protected areas throughout the country. Animals Peru has over 1,800 species of birds (120 endemic to Peru), and 500 species of mammals and over 300 species of reptiles. Peru has hundreds of mammals including some rare species like the puma, jaguar and spectacled bear, that live in the canopy so jungle lodges usually construct towers to observe life above. The Pacific holds a bounty of sea bass, flounder, anchovies, tuna, crustacean (crab or lobster), shellfish and seals. The Pacific also has a lot of sharks, sperm whales, and whales. The Birds of Peru have an economic importance, because of the concentrations of guano deposits that are exported to different countries. Alpaca is also a native of Peru which is now domesticated for its Alpaca fiber. Insects As of March 2009 scientists have discovered two new species of beetles, Eriopis canrash and Cycloneda andresii. Mammals Sea lions in the Ballestas Islands. Peru has over 500 species of mammals, of which about 70 are endemic and about 109 are threatened or endangered. These include spectacular species like the jaguar and spectacled bear and rare endemic species like the yellow-tailed woolly monkey. In January 2007, scientists discovered a new species of cloud-forest rodent of the spiny rat family (Isothrix barbarabrownae) in Manu. In March 2009, scientists discovered a new species of mouse (Akodon sp.nov) Birds Andean cock-of-the-rock, Peru's national bird. Peru's national bird is the Andean cock-of-the-rock. Peru has over 1,800 species of birds - the second-highest number of any country in the world. New species of birds are still being discovered and cataloged by scientists. 42 species from Peru have been officially added to science in the last 30 years. In January 2010, scientists found a new population of five Long-whiskered Owlets which are very rare in the wild. On February 22, 1990, Grace P. Servat found a new distinctive species of the Tyrant Flycatcher called twisting. Which remained undescribed and unidentified until re-discovered by Daniel F. Lane in November 2002. Then on September 15, 2003, Frank P. Lambert obtained the first-natural history of the bird. The Manu Biosphere Reserve is believed to have the highest concentration of bird species in the world, with 1,000‚Äîone out of every nine on the Earth. Reptiles Peru has around 300 species of reptiles of which around 100 are endemic. Peru's reptile fauna includes spectacular species like giant anacondas and caimans, as well as many other snakes, lizards and turtles. Amphibians There are about 380 species of frogs in Peru (based on this search at the Amphibian Species of the World website). It is easy to see a few species on night hikes in the lowland rain forest areas in Tambopata, Manu or Iquitos. Ten new frog species have been discovered over the past two years in the cloud forests of the Peruvian Andes. Frogs Ameerega macero in the Madre de Dios region Some species of frog found in Peru are: * Monkey frog - Phyllomedusa bicolor * Tree frog - Dendropsophus rhodopeplus * Three-striped poison dart frog - Epipedobates trivittatus Salamanders * Nauta mushroomtongue salamander - Bolitoglossa altamazonica * Rio Santa Rosa salamander - Bolitoglossa digitigrada * Peru mushroomtongue salamander - Bolitoglossa peruviana In March 2009, scientists discovered a pygmy frog. The pygmy frog is unlike many other species of frog because its eggs don't become tadpoles like those of most frogs. Also, they only lay two eggs. Plants Peru also has an equally diverse amount of plants. The coast of Peru is usually barren apart from some cacti that grow there. Hilly areas known as lomas such as Lachay, include many endemic species. The river valleys also contain unique plant life. The Highlands above the tree-line is known as puna, where bushes, cactus and drought-resistant plants, such as ichu grass extend up to the zone of snow- capped mountains. The most spectacular plant in Peru is the gigantic Puya raimondii seen near Huaraz. On the lower slopes of the Andes are steep-sided cloud-forests with among it can sustain moss, orchids, and bromeliads. The very wet Amazon Rainforest contains useful lumber, and resins plus strange canopy plants and palm trees. As of March 2009 Scientists have discovered a new kind of plant Senecio sanmarcosensis which is part of the high-Andean wetlands vegetation. It is only found at above sea level. Locations Peru has some good locations to watch all of this wildlife: * Bahuaja-Sonene National Park * Ballestas Islands (Islas Ballestas) * Colca Canyon * Huascar√°n National Park - This park is located in the Central part of Peru. It includes El Huascaran - the highest peak in Peru. Special species include the Spectacled Bear and the Vicuna. * Iquitos * Man√∫ National Park - Manu is located on the eastern slopes of the Andes and stretches to the lowland rain forest on the Brazilian border. * Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve - It is located in the headwaters of the Amazon River in northeastern Peru, on an alluvial plain between the Mara√±on and Ucayali river systems. It is accessible via the Amazon River through the city of Iquitos in the department of Loreto, or through the city of Tarapoto via Yurimaguas. This is one of the best places for wildlife spotting, which is a RAMSAR site and the largest government- protected area in the floodable Amazon rainforest in South America. * Pampa Galeras National Reserve.

Uniquely amongst this leadership Pequito Rebelo enlisted in the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps during the First World War, whilst also writing extensively for the integralist journals, often on the theme of his hatred for urbanism. Pequito Rebelo was involved in the monarchist uprising of 1919 and suffered serious wounds in the fighting. However, when brought to trial for his involvement he was surprisingly exonerated. New ideals Pequito Rebelo's ideas appeared to radicalise with age as he came under the influence of Georges Valois and took to writing for the syndicalist paper Politico. He looked set for a switch to the National Syndicalists but again changed his mind and became a loyalist for Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar. The two enjoyed a fairly cordial personal relationship and in 1932 Pequito Rebelo advised Salazar to abandon the Portuguese constitution and establish a new order in the country.Filipe de Meneses, Salazar: A Political Biography, Enigma Books, 2009, p. 77 They remained in regular correspondence throughout the 1930s.de Meneses, Salazar, p. 194 Adventurism Left somewhat restless by his support for the government Pequito Rebelo volunteered as an aviator in the Spanish Civil War on the side of Francisco Franco.

It was conceived as a title aimed at professional programmers, in contrast to the majority of hobbyist-oriented computer magazines of the period. Adams served as the magazine's first editor. The magazine's heyday coincided with the availability of cheap PC clones running MS-DOS and the first widely adopted version of Windows,Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, although many of .EXE‚Ä≤s readers would have been beta testers before this. both factors which encouraged the spread of programming into smaller businesses and created an audience for .EXE and similar titles that followed. Unusually for the UK, the magazine was sold primarily by postal subscription and controlled circulation, rather than in retail newsagents. This reflected its focus on a professional audience, as many readers obtained their copies through their employment. .EXE‚Ä≤s content consisted largely of practical how-to articles focusing on particular platforms or techniques, along with more general software development content, news, book reviews and regular columns. With an audience consisting primarily of PC software developers, the content was largely for the DOS and Windows platforms, although over the years .EXE published articles on OS/2, Modula-2, Smalltalk and PalmPilot development, among others. The magazine featured regular columns on C++, Java, Visual Basic and Unix and took an early interest in Linux and open source more generally, particularly under the editorship of David Mery, featuring interviews with prominent open source and free software proponents including Eric Raymond and Richard Stallman. In 1992 the magazine's publisher Process Communications was sold to Centaur Communications (now Centaur Media), ostensibly because Centaur was interested in a Process title called Software Management. In the end, Centaur elected to keep .EXE running and closed Software Management and the third Process title, BASIC Magazine. This left .EXE as the only print title aimed at software professionals at Centaur, and the only title focused on computing and technology, at least until New Media Age debuted in 1995. In 1995 the magazine was re-branded as EXE Magazine, dropping the dot, which caused some controversy among regular readers and spawned the nickname 'Dotless' for the new version. At around the same time the magazine launched an online venture called EXplodE - later EXE Online - which started as a companion title with its own editor, but was later taken over by the print editorial team and evolved into an online archive of content and a marketing vehicle for the print title. Several of EXE‚Ä≤s editorial staff were well known in the UK technology community as journalists or otherwise. The magazine's second editor, Robert Schifreen, had previously been notorious for his involvement in the hacking of a Telecom Gold account belonging to Prince Philip. Other editors or staff writers included Will Watts, Danny O'Brien, Cliff Saran and Hobbit Coward. In later years, EXE began to feature more product reviews and 'advertorial' content such as salary surveys, as its publishers sought to make the magazine more commercially focused. The magazine partnered with the UK- based Association of C and C++ Users to produce conference events. However, the market for computer magazines in general was in decline, and as knowledge and technical information about software development began to move primarily online, print titles like EXE began to lose readers and advertisers. Centaur shuttered the magazine in the summer of 2000, selling its content and branding - perhaps ironically - to the magazine that inspired its creation, Dr. Dobb's Journal. EXE was also the first home of satirical columnist Verity Stob, who went on to write for Dr Dobbs and, latterly The Register.

Its products included steam boat engines, furnaces, locomotives, and firearms (notably cannons) before, during and after the United States Civil War. The remains of the facility can still be seen today. History The Noble Brothers Foundry was built by James Noble Sr. and his six sons (William, James Jr., Stephen, George, Samuel and John) around 1855 in Rome, Georgia. The brothers ordered a lathe from Pennsylvania around the same time. This massive lathe was brought by boat to Mobile, Alabama. From there it was transported by a river boat up the Coosa River to the first waterfall. Here the lathe was unpacked and hauled by horse and cart to the foundry at First and Broad Street. The foundry manufactured steam boat engines, furnaces, and locomotives. In 1857, the foundry produced the first locomotive for the Rome Railroad, making this the first locomotive to be manufactured below Richmond. In 1861 the production of the foundry took on another role. The Confederate Government ordered the foundry to produce cannons and other war materials. A rifle plant was built by the brothers, but burned down before production got started. Jefferson Davis exempted the brothers from battlefield fighting. He proclaimed \\"... the 6 Noble brothers are exempt from the fighting as we have plenty of men to fight but few that can make cannons.\\" A Noble Brothers Foundry 954-pound cannon that was made around 1861 is on display outdoors in Naperville, IL. To see the cannon, head to Central Park off Benton Street any time of the year. Even though the foundry's production of cannon had been halted by the Confederate government due to an investigation into improper manufacture of weapons at the facility, they continued output of other war- related materials, especially locomotives, attracted the attention of the Union Army and was a prime factor in the occupation of Rome by Sherman's troops in 1864. On their way out of town at the end of the occupation, Sherman's troops burned the foundry facility to the ground, and attempted to dismantle the lathe using sledgehammers, with little success. The hammers marks are still visible today and the fire caused minimum damage to the lathe. The massive machine stayed in production until the mid-1960s. The Noble Brothers played a major role in rebuilding Rome after the American Civil War. They played key roles in the production of Rome's Clock Tower.

It enters Arkansas from Texas, concurrent with US Highway 67, at a junction with US Highway 71 on the border between Texarkana, Texas and Texarkana, Arkansas. The route leaves Arkansas on the Lake Village Bridge over the Mississippi River near Lake Village, crossing into Mississippi. Route description US 82 runs across the southern tier of counties in Arkansas, serving three cities of regional importance: Texarkana, Magnolia, and El Dorado in the Arkansas Timberlands. The eastern half of the route runs through the Lower Arkansas Delta, serving small towns and agricultural areas. US 82 enters the state from Texarkana, TX concurrent with US 67 as a pair of one-way streets. Running east as 7th Street (the westbound half of the couplet is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd), the road enters Arkansas at an intersection with State Line Avenue. The junction provides US 67/ US 82 with access northward to US 59/US 71 via US 71Y (unsigned). At Hazel Street, US 67/US 82 intersects US 59/US 71, beginning a brief concurrency east to Hickory St, when US 59/US 71 turns south toward Shreveport, LA. The intersection is near the J.K. Wadley House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The two one-way streets combine at Hickory St and run east as 9th Street to Broad Street, where US 67 turns northeast. Continuing east, US 82 intersects Interstate 49 (I-49) with a diamond interchange, the only junction with an Interstate highway in Arkansas. In east Texarkana, US 82 intersects Highway 237 south of the Texarkana Regional Airport. Highway 82 crosses the Red River East of Texarkana, US 82 runs to the east side of Miller County near the Lafayette County line and Red River. The route intersects Highway 296 before turning south toward Garland, where it intersects Highway 134. US 82 turns east and crosses the Red River to enter Lafayette County. US 82 runs east to Lewisville, the county seat of Lafayettte County, where it intersects Highway 29 just south of downtown Lewisville. The route continues east to Stamps, where a concurrency begins with Highway 53 to Buckner, where Highway 53 turns north. East of Buckley, the highway crosses into Columbia County, with the county line following Dorcheat Bayou. After passing over Dorcheat Bayou, US 82 serves as the northern terminus of Highway 344 near Lake Columbia. Continuing east to Lumber, US 82 intersects Highway 98 and turns southeast toward Magnolia. Highway 98 in this area is a former alignment of US 82, which formerly ran through Waldo and McNeil. US 82 intersects US 371 near the northwest corner of Magnolia; giving access to downtown Magnolia. US 82 serves as the northern boundary for Magnolia and Southern Arkansas University (SAU), including Walker Stadium at Goodheart Field, the football stadium. US 82 serves as the northern terminus of Highway 355 (Washington Street), which serves as the main road through campus. On the eastern side of the city, US 82 intersects and overlaps US 79 for until a junction with US 82B (Main Street). US 82B runs west toward downtown Magnolia, US 79 continues south to Haynesville, Louisiana, and US 82 turns east as a section line road toward El Dorado. Entering Union County, US 82 serves as the southern terminus of Highway 57 at Marysville and Highway 172 at Cairo before passing the South Arkansas Regional Airport. Shortly after entering the city limits of El Dorado, US 82 veers right onto an divided highway, with a former alignment continuing toward the central business district as a business route. Along the city's southwest side, US 82 serves as a northern terminus of Highway 15 at exit 18.

The highway exits the town heading due east, turns north and begins an overlap with Highway 52 and US 425\\\\. Shortly after turning north, Highway 52 breaks from the concurrency toward the west, with US 82/US 425 continuing north to Hamburg. Upon entering the city, US 82/US 425 begins overlaps with Highway 52, passing the First United Methodist Church and Hamburg Commercial Historic District. North of downtown, US 82 turns east onto St. Louis Street, with US 425 and Highway 8 continuing north on Main Street. The route runs northeast to Thebes, where it has a junction with Highway 160 before bypassing Montrose, where US 82B serves the downtown business district. US 82 has a grade-separated intersection with US 165 in Montrose before continuing east into Chicot County. The route continues east to Lake Village; from there across the Mississippi River to Greenville, MS. History The route was designated on July 1, 1931. In Arkansas, it replaced State Road 2. US 82 was realigned around Waldo and Magnolia on February 25, 1954 on to present-day US 371\\\\. The former alignment of US 82 was redesignated at Highway 98.. On May 20, 1970, this segment was bypassed by a new terrain US 82\\\\. The former routings were renumbered Highway 98 and Highway 19 (now US 371), and the Magnolia business route was created.. * El Dorado was bypassed in the 1980s; Highway 2 is now a business route. * The segment between Crossett and Hamburg has been rerouted several times, most recently in the 1970s. Highway 2 is now parts of Highway 133 and Highway 52 north of Crossett, a short spur of Highway 189 in Hamburg, and a county road from the end of Highway 189 south to Highway 52. * Montrose was bypassed in the 1940s by a railroad overpass; Highway 2 is now a minor business route. In 1989, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Act 622. This act authorized governor Bill Clinton to sign a compact with Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama to four-lane US 82 across the four states. The compact also created the U.S. Highway 82 Four Lane Construction Authority to assist the effort. Mike Kinard, state senator from Magnolia, sponsored the bill. Mississippi joined the effort in 1989, appointing three citizens to the Authority.

In C Shell, a similar functionality is provided as the \`source\` command, and this name is seen in \\"extended\\" POSIX shells as well. The dot command is not to be confused with a dot file, which is a dot-prefixed hidden file or hidden directory. Nor is it to be confused with the \`./scriptfile\` notation for running commands, which is simply a relative path pointing to the current directory (notated in Unix as a '.' character, and typically outside of the Path variable).  Arguments  The filename is the dot command's first argument. When this argument does not contain a slash, the shell will search for the file in all directories defined in the PATH environment variable. Unlike normal commands which are also found in PATH, the file to source does not have to be executable. Otherwise the filename is considered as a simple path to the file. In several \\"extended\\" shells including bash, zsh and ksh, one may specify parameters in a second argument. If no parameters are specified, the sourced file will receive the set of positional parameters available in the current context. If parameters are specified, the sourced file will receive only the specified parameters. In any case, parameter \`$0\` will be the \`$0\` of the current context.  Usages  Since the execution of the source file is done in the invoking context, environment changed within apply to the current process or the current shell. This is very different from scripts run directly by shebang or as \`sh foo.sh\`, which are run in a new, separate process space, with a separate environment. Therefore, the dot command can be used for splitting a big script into smaller pieces, potentially enabling modular design. Sourcing is also often done by the shell on session startup for user profile files like \`.bashrc\` and \`.profile\`. Source \`source\` is a shell-builtin command that evaluates the file following the command, as a list of commands, executed in the current context.\\"BASH BUILTIN COMMANDS\\", the (GNU) Linux man page for \\"source\\" in Bash-3.0. 2004 Apr 20 Frequently the \\"current context\\" is a terminal window into which the user is typing commands during an interactive session. The source command can be abbreviated as just a dot (\`.\`) in Bash and similar POSIX-ish shells. However, this is not acceptable in C shell, where the command first appeared. Some Bash scripts should be run using the \`source your-script\` syntax rather than run as an executable command, e.g., if they contain a change directory (\`cd\`) command and the user intends that they be left in that directory after the script is complete, or they contain an export command and the user wants to modify the environment of the current shell. Another usage situation is when a script file does not have the \\"execute\\" permission. Passing the script filename to the desired shell will run the script in a subshell, not the current context.

In 1977, Wen Fong, Special Consultant for Far East Affairs at the Metropolitan Museum and a professor at Princeton University, went to China and visited gardens in Suzhou with Professor Chen Congzhou, an architectural historian from Tongji University. It was their decision that the Late Spring Studio courtyard (Dian Chun Yi), a small part of the Garden of the Master of the Nets, should provide the basis of the museum's installation, for several reasons.Murck, Alfreda; Fong, Wen, A Chinese Garden Court: The Astor Court at The Metropolitan Museum of Art Reprinted from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, Winter 1980/81. Page 55 The measurements of the small court were appropriate to the area the museum had in mind.

Suzhou officials responded positively and offered a number of modifications, and offered photographs of Taihu rocks they proposed be part of the design, and by the end of 1978 an agreement was signed for the project. In China, construction began on a permanent prototype to remain in Suzhou. China granted special permission to log nan trees for the wooden pillars that are central to the architecture. Nan, which is related to cedar, was driven close to extinction during the Qing Dynasty, and is only used in exceptional constructions such as the Memorial Hall of Mao Zedong. Another critical element of the construction of a Chinese court is tile, and to meet the requirement of the project an old imperial kiln was reopened. Each ceiling and floor tile was made by hand -- or rather by foot, as the clay was pressed into frames by the workers' feet.Murck, Alfreda; Fong, Wen, A Chinese Garden Court: The Astor Court at The Metropolitan Museum of Art Reprinted from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, Winter 1980/81.

The New York Times. The American contribution was limited to preparing the modern infrastructure of ducts and circuitry, staining the wood, plastering, and painting; all other work was performed by a team of twenty-seven from the Suzchou Garden Administration. The workers included carpenters, tile workers, masons, and rock experts. Most of the fabrication had been done in China and the pieces were numbered for assembly. The wood structures rely on mortise-and-tenon and mitering techniques of joinery as old as the fourth century BC, and of uncommon sophistication; one pillar is joined to over fifteen architectural members without nails, and secured with wood pins with just a firm tap of a mallet for added stability.Murck, Alfreda; Fong, Wen, A Chinese Garden Court: The Astor Court at The Metropolitan Museum of Art Reprinted from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, Winter 1980/81.

Details in the architectural elements can be easily missed, but amplify the Chinese sensibility that informs the design. For example, the court has several examples of Chinese wordplay. The colonnade jogs around a taihu rock called a \\"bamboo shoot\\" for its tall, narrow shape. This is a \\"visual pun on the surrounding live bamboo.\\" The roof tiles, whose soft black tone is the result of firing with rice husks followed by a water bath while still warm, are fronted with stylized characters for \\"bat\\" (fu) which sounds like a word meaning happiness or good fortune, along with lu meaning wealth and shou meaning long life‚Äîthe three happinesses of an authentic Ming design.Murck, Alfreda; Fong, Wen, A Chinese Garden Court: The Astor Court at The Metropolitan Museum of Art Reprinted from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, Winter 1980/81.

Page 47 This is a style of northern China which allows more sun to be admitted to the interior than the deep overhangs more favored in the south. The court includes elaborate compositions of rocks. One large rock, part of a configuration salvaged from an abandoned garden near Tiger Hill at the edge of Suzhou, resembles a famous one in the Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou, and illustrates an important quality of rock aesthetic, that the base should be narrower than the peak.

Chinese crews in New York At the time of the installation in 1980, not long after the improvement of relations between the U.S. and China, the artisans and workers from the People's Republic of China attracted popular attention in New York.

The American foreman, Joseph DiGiacomo, is prominently quoted in the film, discussing \\"the mutual respect that developed between the American and Chinese workers.

Education 3.0 is an umbrella term used by educational theorists to describe a variety of ways to integrate technology into learning. According to Jeff Borden, Education 3.0 entails a confluence of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and education technology, using web-based digital and mobile technology, including apps, hardware and software, and \\"anything else with an e in front of it.\\" Instead of viewing digital technology as a competitor to current teaching models, Education 3.0 means actively embracing new technologies to see how they can help students learn efficiently. Writer Michael Horn describes it as moving \\"beyond mass education to mass-customized education through blended learning,\\" using the flexibility of technology to help students of varying backgrounds and skills. The term has been included in the term Entrepreneurship Education 3.0 which denotes a broadening of entrepreneurship education with interdisciplinary appeal for non-business majors, according to a report in Technically Philly magazine. With Education 3.0, classes move away from traditional lectures and instead focus on interactive learning, with question and answer sessions, reviews and quizzes, discussions, labs, and other project-based learning. It usually involves customization and personalization, such that educational content is tailored to meet the needs of specific students. It can mean reversing the traditional classroom learning, in which lectures happen in class and homework is done out of class, into flipped classrooms, such that new content is delivered online while students work on assignments together in class. The term has been used by educational theorists in South Korea and in Latin America. According to a report in Forbes magazine, schools such as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology or KAIST are actively exploring Education 3.0. In Latin America, Educaci√≥n 3.0 is being explored as a way to make education affordable to poor people throughout the region, and to help ameliorate poverty.

Yank! - O Musical won 4 Brazilian National Theatre Academy Awards (including Best Musical and Best Cast) and 2 Broadway World Brazil Awards (including Best Translation). Critical reception The New York Times gave an overall favorable review of Yank!, citing its blend of humor with drama and the quality of the songwriting. The Times noted the \\"accidental topicality\\" of the musical as it related to the DADT repeal effort. However, the paper found weaknesses in the production, notably the failure to explore some themes, specifically fidelity between gay couples and personal loyalty versus military honor. While labeling the first act \\"delightful\\", the Times found the second act to be \\"muddled\\". The creators, it says, adhere too closely to the formulas of heterosexual romantic musicals of the war era, saying that it \\"derails a show that had been moving along nicely\\". Overall, says the Times, the show suffers from being too ambitious. Awards and nominations The York Theatre production garnered nominations for several awards for the 2009-2010 season. These included nominations for two Lucille Lortel Awards, for Outstanding Musical and Jeffry Denman for Outstanding Choreographer; two Outer Critics Circle Awards, for Outstanding New Off-Broadway Musical and Outstanding New Score (Broadway or Off-Broadway); and seven Drama Desk Awards nominations, for Outstanding Musical, Bobby Steggert for Outstanding Actor in a Musical, Jeffry Denman for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical, Igor Goldin for Outstanding Director of a Musical, Joseph Zellnik for Outstanding Music, David Zellnik for Outstanding Lyrics, and David Zellnik for Outstanding Book of a Musical.

He is the President of the Front for the National Salvation of Cameroon (Front pour le salut national du Cameroun, FSNC), a minor political party. He is notorious for dismissing as fake news a video of Cameroon soldiers killing women and children in the north of the country.bbc.com Early career and imprisonment Tchiroma studied in France and became a materials and construction engineer. Working in Douala, Tchiroma was a Research Officer at the Cameroon Railways Authority (Regie des Chemins de Fer, Regifercam), the state railway company of Cameroon, until April 1984. When soldiers attempted to overthrow President Paul Biya in a coup attempt on 6 April 1984, sparking days of fighting in Yaound√©, Tchiroma was in Douala. According to Tchiroma, he was uninvolved in the coup attempt and the violence was as mysterious to him as it was to others at the time; he said that he observed the gloomy atmosphere that prevailed in the city and noted the general lack of reliable information about what was occurring in Yaound√©.Xavier Mess√®, \\"Issa Tchiroma Bakary : Je n'ai pas de rancune\\" , Mutations, 6 April 2009 . The coup attempt was ultimately defeated by Biya loyalists, and the government began rounding up individuals suspected of involvement. Tchiroma continued going to work at Regifercam, but he quickly came under suspicion of being involved in the coup attempt; he was a northerner, and northerners were considered to be primarily responsible for the coup attempt. After a few days in which his home was repeatedly searched and damaged, Tchiroma was arrested on 16 April 1984. Described as \\"a very dangerous element\\", he was taken to Yaound√© and initially imprisoned for three days in a small cell, three square meters in size, which had no toilet, light, or ventilation. Other prisoners were removed from the cell, as Tchiroma was deemed so dangerous that he needed to be kept alone. Reflecting later on the ordeal, Tchiroma said that it was the worst memory of his life and that he would not wish the experience on his worst enemy. Tchiroma was subsequently incarcerated at the Kondengui prison before being moved to the Yoko prison. At his trial before a military tribunal, he was defended by Yondo Black. While in prison, Tchiroma, who is a Francophone Cameroonian, studied English.Kini Nsom and Nformi Sonde Kinsai, \\"I Studied English In Prison ‚Äì Tchiroma\\", The Post (Cameroon), 20 June 2008. After over six years in prison, he was released in 1990. Political activities and government service during the 1990s Following Tchiroma's release, he participated in a protest in Garoua against the actions of those who, in his view, were impeding the implementation of the law providing amnesty to individuals implicated in the 1984 coup attempt. He was then arrested and jailed again. According to Tchiroma, his arrest provoked anger among northerners, and he credited Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo'o, the Secretary-General of North Province, with securing his release in order to defuse the situation. Tchiroma was Secretary-General of the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP), an opposition party, in the early 1990s.Omar Diop, Partis politiques et processus de transition d√©mocratique en Afrique noire (2006), page 118 . In the March 1992 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as a UNDP candidate in the B√©nou√© constituency of North Province.List of deputies elected in 1992, National Assembly website . Later in the year, after Biya controversially won the October 1992 presidential election, Tchiroma was appointed to the government as Minister of Transport by Biya on 27 November 1992, along with another UNDP leader, Hamadou Moustapha. He and Moustapha accepted their appointments without the approval of UNDP President Maigari Bello Bouba; the appointments were viewed by some as a way of dividing and weakening the opposition by coopting certain opposition figures.Joseph Takougang, \\"Cameroon: Biya and Incremental Reform\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. John Frank Clark and David E. Gardinier, pages 171‚Äì172.Milton H.

John Mukum Mbaku and Joseph Takougang, page 83. After Tchiroma and Moustapha were retained in their posts as part of the government named in July 1994, Bello Bouba said on 23 July 1994 that their continued inclusion in the government would mean the end of their membership in the UNDP.\\"Northern Cameroon: Attacks on Freedom of Expression by Governmental and Traditional Authorities\\" , Article 19, July 1995. Tchiroma and Moustapha challenged their removal from the party, but they were expelled by the UNDP Central Committee in January 1995.African State and Society in the 1990s, page 199. Following their expulsion, Tchiroma and Moustapha established their own \\"authentic\\" faction of the UNDP, rejecting Bello Bouba's leadership. That faction then became the National Alliance for Democracy and Progress (ANDP), a new party featuring a slight alteration of the UNDP's name, and it was legally recognized on 31 August 1995.List of political parties in Cameroon . Despite their creation of a new party, Moustapha and Tchiroma still legally contested Bello Bouba's leadership of the UNDP. In 1996, while serving as Minister of Transport, Tchiroma urged companies in the United States to invest in Cameroon, saying that the country could not develop without foreign investment.\\"African seek development partners \\\\ don't want charity, officials say. About 60 U.S. companies interested in aviation, maritime projects\\", Akron Beacon Journal, 11 September 1996, page D7.

Return to the UNDP and creation of the FSNC Tchiroma ultimately left the ANDP and rejoined the UNDP at a January 2002 party congress in Maroua. Following the June 2002 parliamentary election, Tchiroma and four other notable northern politicians released a statement in July, in which they alleged electoral fraud and announced the formation of a \\"resistance front\\". They warned that the governing Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (RDPC) was moving the country back to single-party rule and called on politicians \\"to transcend any divergence, selfishness and personal ambition in order to create a movement capable of saving Cameroon from collapse\\".\\"Five former Cameroonian ministers allege vote rigging\\", Panapress, 15 July 2002.

At the time of the October 2004 presidential election, Tchiroma was part of the opposition coalition and denounced President Biya, urging the people to vote him out.Kini Nsom, \\"Tchiroma Supports Constitutional Amendment\\", The Post (Cameroon), 22 February 2008. He took that stance even though Bello Bouba and the UNDP leadership chose to support Biya's candidacy. Tchiroma headed a panel that was tasked with choosing a joint opposition candidate for the election, which would have improved the opposition's chances of defeating Biya. The panel chose Adamou Ndam Njoya, the President of the Cameroon Democratic Union (UDC), as the joint opposition candidate; however, John Fru Ndi, the Chairman of the Social Democratic Front (SDF), reacted angrily to the decision, saying that the selection process was improper and that he would stand as a candidate despite the panel's decision. Tchiroma in turn criticized Fru Ndi: \\"The rules to which all of us willingly subscribed, including him, were respected. If he were the democrat he claims to be, he should simply bow down to the will of the majority.\\" With Ndam Njoya and Fru Ndi both standing and thereby splitting the opposition vote, a victory for Biya was considered to be almost certain.Tansa Musa, \\"Cameroon opposition fails to see eye to eye\\", Reuters (IOL), 18 September 2004. Tchiroma later left the UNDP again and founded a new party, the Front for the National Salvation of Cameroon (FSNC), which was officially registered in January 2007. At the time, he said that the FSNC \\"intends to contribute to the advent of a free society and promote the democratisation process in Cameroon\\".\\"Cameroon gets 200th political party\\", African Press Agency, 19 January 2007. At a press conference on 20 February 2008, he announced his party's support for constitutional amendments favored by the government, including the elimination of presidential term limits. Although other opposition leaders viewed the amendments as a transparent effort to allow Paul Biya to remain in power, Tchiroma argued that the amendments should be considered on their own merits. He particularly stressed his support for extending the 45-day period for organizing a new presidential election following a vacancy in the office,Aim√©- Francis Amougou, \\"Constitution : Issa Tchiroma Bakary pour la modification\\" , Cameroon Tribune, 21 February 2008 . arguing that it was \\"almost impossible\\" to do so within that length of time. He also argued that removing the presidential term limits would promote a climate of peace and stability by avoiding the uncertainty associated with a presidential succession, and he said that would in turn encourage foreign investment in Cameroon. On the same occasion, Tchiroma criticized other opposition leaders, saying that they were power-hungry and would be willing to start a civil war, while also denying that he had been bribed into supporting the amendments; according to Tchiroma, he considered the arguments of both sides, consulted constitutional experts, and then concluded that the ruling party's position was correct. In an interview published by the Cameroon Tribune on 29 June 2009, Tchiroma defended President Biya in the midst of media claims about his wealth and argued that Biya was working to \\"eradicate corruption\\". He also alleged that foreign agents were working to destabilize Cameroon.Martin A. Nkemngu, \\"Issa Tchiroma Bakary ‚Äì ¬´President Biya is Out to Eradicate Corruption¬ª\\", Cameroon Tribune, 29 June 2009.

According to Tchiroma, he learned of his appointment when someone who had just heard the announcement called him to tell him to turn on the radio. He said that he initially took it as a joke and that he was very happy when he learned it was true, while stressing that \\"the responsibility and challenge is enormous\\". He took up his post on 1 July 2009.Patricia Ngo Ngouem, \\"Mincom : Issa Tchiroma prend fonction\\", Mutations, 2 July 2009 . On 17 August 2009, Tchiroma announced that he had ordered the closure of Sky One Radio due to \\"multiple infringements of laws governing communications in Cameroon\\". According to the government, the station was trying to solve social problems through its Le Tribunal program and thereby supersede the Ministry of Social Services. Tchiroma said that he had tried three times to reach an agreement with the station management, but was unsuccessful; he added that the station would be reopened if the management \\"promises to respect the code of ethics and the ministry's specifications\\".\\"Private radio station suspended indefinitely\\", JED/IFEX, 19 August 2009. When President Biya took an expensive vacation in France in September 2009, the vacation's cost generated some anger, but Tchiroma argued that Biya, \\"like any other worker ... has a right to his vacations\\" and that in taking vacations he was free to use \\"the means put at his disposal by the sovereign people ... to provide his needs\\".Mike Pflanz, \\"Cameroon president defends ¬£35,000-a-day French holiday\\", The Telegraph, 4 September 2009. The journalist Bibi Ngota, who was arrested on charges of fraud on 10 March 2010, died at Kondengui prison in April 2010. Tchiroma said that Ngota had been HIV positive and that he had died due to infections that had \\"overwhelmed\\" his weakened immune system, despite the best efforts of prison doctors. However, some expressed skepticism regarding the official version of events, claiming that Ngota had not received treatment. Ngota's brother was angered by Tchiroma's explanation and said that he was lying.\\"Cameroon says detained journalist died of 'infections'\\", AFP, 29 April 2010. As Cameroon held celebrations marking its 50th year of independence from France in May 2010, Tchiroma acknowledged in an interview that \\"Cameroon has suffered from poor governance, mismanagement and corruption\\", while arguing that the country was making progress under President Biya. He noted that a high level of peace and stability had been preserved in Cameroon, in contrast to many other African nations. Regarding the controversy surrounding Ngota's death and allegations that he was tortured in hopes of extracting information on his sources, Tchiroma described the journalist as a \\"rascal\\" but insisted that Ngota was not subjected to torture and that his arrest had not been politically motivated.\\"Cameroon: A 50th independence anniversary amid joy and pain\\", Afrik.com, 28 May 2010. On 21 June 2010, Tchiroma announced the news that the wreckage of a missing plane carrying the Australian businessman Ken Talbot and the rest of the board of the mining company Sundance Resources had been found in Congo-Brazzaville following an extensive search. The plane had taken off in Yaound√© and was travelling to the Congolese town of Yangadou, and all 11 people on board apparently died in the crash.\\"Australian tycoon's plane found, all feared dead\\", AFP, 21 June 2010. After a gay Cameroonian man was granted asylum in the United Kingdom due to his sexuality, Tchiroma said in July 2010 that, although homosexuality was illegal in Cameroon, homosexuals were not prosecuted for their private activities. He dismissed the asylum- seeker's claims, arguing that the man had nothing to fear from the law.\\"Cameroon denies homosexuals face persecution\\", BBC News, 8 July 2010. Tchiroma stated on 20 April 2017 that Biya had ordered the restoration of internet service in Anglophone parts of Cameroon, where it had been cut off in January 2017 due to unrest. Tchiroma said that the denial of internet service was no longer necessary because the situation in the Anglophone regions had largely returned to normal.\\"Cameroun : Paul Biya ordonne le r√©tablissement d‚Äôinternet dans les r√©gions anglophones\\", Jeune Afrique, 21 July 2017 .

It opened in 1936 to build B-O-P (Buick-Oldsmobile- Pontiac) cars for sale on the west coast. It was the first GM plant to build multiple car lines, resulting from a Depression-spawned move to cut production costs by sharing components and manufacturing. South Gate was the second of several B-O-P \\"branch\\" assembly plants (the first being the Buick-operated Linden plant), part of GM's strategy to have production facilities in major metropolitan cities. The location was under the management of GM's newly created Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division created in 1945. These \\"branch\\" plants would build cars for distribution to a specific region. By 1949 it was producing full size cars from the Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac brands. During the mid-1950s it was General Motors' highest-output plant. Vehicles included the Oldsmobile 98, Pontiac Streamliner, Buick Special, and the Cadillac Series 61. It added production of the Pontiac Tempest, Oldsmobile F-85, and Buick Special alongside the fullsize cars for 1961. When the compacts became intermediates for 1964 their production ceased at South Gate, and Chevrolet Impala fullsize production was added, after the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division was renamed GM Assembly Division (GMAD) in 1965. The plant was converted from full-size car production to the subcompact Chevrolet Vega for 1975. This arrangement was short-lived, and GM returned the factory to building full-size Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, and Buick B-body vehicles for 1977. The Oldsmobile and Buick were dropped and the Cadillac DeVille added for 1979. However, due to decreasing sales of the Chevrolet B-body cars, the plant was idled in March 1980. It was then retooled once again for subcompacts, building the 1982 Chevrolet Cavalier and Cadillac Cimarron. Slow sales and efforts to reduce air quality issues resulted in the closure of the plant, with production ending on March 23, 1982. The plant site was later environmentally remediated and used as the location for new schools, including South East High School (opened 2005), which were built by the Los Angeles Unified School District to relieve severe congestion in the existing schools of South Gate.Southeast Area New HS No. 2/MS No. 3 (19370369) at California Department of Toxic Substances Control website.

Early years Augier's earliest direct political involvement began in the Republican- Socialist Party, although the main focus of his youthful energies was the Centre la√Øc des auberges, a non-political group central to the development of youth hostels in France.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 15 Although its leader Jean Giono was not a fascist, it was Augier's fascination with Giono's primitivism that eventually led the young Augier to adopt that ideology. He was also a supporter of paganism against Christian \\"decadence\\". Collaboration Augier formed his own group, the Les Jeunes de l'Europe Nouvelle, in 1941, attracting 4000 members and affiliating to the Groupe Collaboration. He became associated with the Breton nationalist Alphonse de Ch√¢teaubriant, a leading figure in the Groupe, and was for a time business manager of his journal La Gerbe. Augier then joined the political bureau of Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (PPF). He enlisted in the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism and served on the Eastern Front whilst also launching and editing the group's paper Le Combattant Europ√©en. He served in both the LVF and the French Waffen SS as a war correspondent. He was also responsible for the French Waffen SS' official organ, Devenir (\\"To become\\" or \\"Becoming\\"). However Augier, who still supported economic socialism and hoped that Nazism would take seriously the 'socialism' part of its name, grew disillusioned by the distinct lack of anti- capitalism amongst the SS men with whom he served. Post-war writing In 1945 he went underground and published Face Nord (\\"North Face\\") under the pseudonym M-A de Saint-Loup to pay for his passage to Argentina. The book had some success in France. In Argentina he acted as a technical adviser to Juan Per√≥n and also enlisted in the Argentine Army, attaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He also acted as Eva Peron's ski instructor.Uki Go√±i, The Real ODESSA, London: Granta Books, 2003, p. 167 He was pardoned and returned to France in 1953. Once back in France he published La Nuit commence au Cap Horn (\\"The Night begins in Cap Horn\\") as Saint-Loup. He may have won the prestigious Prix Goncourt for the book but Le Figaro Litt√©raire exposed Augier as the true author. Of the entire jury only Colette refused to retract her vote for Saint-Loup during the ensuing uproar.Dominique Venner, Histoire de la Collaboration, Pygmalion, 2000, p. 536 Saint-Loup continued to work as an author and journalist, writing several books about the LVF (Les Volontaires; \\"The Volunteers\\") and both the French (Les H√©r√©tiques; \\"The Heretics\\", Les Nostalgiques; \\"The Nostalgics\\") and Belgian Waffen SS (Les SS de la Toison d'or; \\"The SS of the Golden Fleece\\"). His writing was marked by a pursuit of adventure, the desire to surpass the self and an antipathy to Christian philosophy. He was an apologist for the foreign SS volunteers with whom he had served. He published several works about regionalist movements and about man's struggle to survive in wild and savage environments. He was also fascinated by cars and motorised transport and wrote biographies of Louis Renault and Marius Berliet. His last novel, La R√©publique du Mont-Blanc (\\"The Republic of Mont- Blanc\\"), was about the survival of a small Savoyard community that took refuge on the mountain to escape intermixing and decadence. Saint-Loup influenced certain pagan and far-right authors such as Pierre Vial and Jean Mabire. Later years He would later return to France where he worked closely with Ren√© Binet whilst also acting as president of Dominique Venner's Comit√© France-Rhodesia. He was featured heavily in France's far right journals until his death.

The film depicts a large part of the story twice, from the perspectives of two people. Plot As a teenager, Jan Thomas Hansen (P√•l Sverre Valheim Hagen) and a friend run off with young boy Isak in a stroller left outside a cafe by the mother. The boy runs away, slips, and falls on a rock, suffering an apparently fatal head injury. Pressured by his friend, Jan Thomas, afraid of the consequences, carries the boy into a nearby river with a strong current, where he sets him adrift. Jan Thomas testifies that the boy was killed by the fall, but he is convicted of murder. While in jail, he plays the organ for church services. As a young adult he is released from prison and works as an organ player at a church. He befriends Anna (Ellen Dorrit Petersen), the priest of the church and a single mother, and her young son Jens. Agnes (Trine Dyrholm), Isak's mother, sees that Jan Thomas has been released and is concerned for the safety of her two adopted daughters. Her panicking reaction causes strain in her relationship with the two girls, as well as with her husband. Meanwhile, her husband accepts a job offer that will move their family to Denmark, in the hopes of easing Agnes' anxiety. Agnes sees Jan Thomas together with Jens, and is also concerned that Jens may not be safe. When Jan Thomas lets Jens wait a few minutes outside Jens' school while Jan Thomas picks something up in the school, he returns to find Jens missing. Jan Thomas is very concerned when Jens is missing. Scared by ensuing events, Jens flees into the river and almost drowns. With great danger for himself Jan Thomas catches him, and holds on to a branch, after which Agnes, in a surprise twist of plot, helps them reach the shore. Jan Thomas confesses to Agnes what really happened earlier to her son Isak. The movie was released in the USA by filmmovement.com.

Background  Nabhan was the facilitator between al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab, he had been wanted by the United States since 2006, as he was a member of the east-African al-Qaeda cell responsible for several terrorist attacks in East Africa, including the 1998 United States embassy bombings and the 2002 Mombasa attacks.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.282 In 2007, in the midst of the Battle of Ras Kamboni, Nabhan was unsuccessfully targeted by an American military airstrike in the town of Ras Kamboni.

Obama picked the airstrike option as it limited the any potential collateral damage and the chances of US casualties.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.282 Raid On the day of the operation, Nabhan was seen traveling in a two-car convoy from the southern coastal town of Barawe, this was reportedly the best opportunity to target him as he would be away from civilian population, particularly as the convoy had stopped for breakfast. As a USMC AV-8B approached its release point, it reported a malfunction in its targeting system; so 4 helicopters (2 AH-6M Little Birds and 2 MH-6M Little Birds) piloted by members of the 160th SOAR, carrying a team of SEALs from DEVGRU launched from a Navy Ship off-shore. The AH-6s strafed the two-vehicle convoy, killing Nabhan and 3 al-Shabaab terrorists, the MH-6s dropped off the DEVGRU operators who cleared the vehicles and recovered Nabhan's body.

He came onto the music scene as a solo artist in 1998, with his debut album Magariro, which carried \\"Pakutema Munda \\", probably the least noticeable from that album. The first cut never received any recognition but he continued to release Vakiridzo the following year. Similarly, the response was lukewarm and in the coming 12 months, he went back into the studio and came out with Simbaradzo. Simbaradzo was to be the turning point in his career and Mundikumbuke and Amai VaRubhi brought Macheso into the limelight. He was to follow on the success of Simbaradzo with Zvakanaka Zvakadaro. He can dance, sing and play the guitar - a rare combination of skills among musicians. Zvakanaka Zvakadaro was followed, in 2003, by Zvido Zvenyu Kunyanya. In 2011 he initiated the popular Zora Butter dance which has come to be known as Macheso's initiative. Macheso was born in 1968 in Shamva, 90 kilometres to the north of Harare, to parents of Malawian origin - a fact that was to inspire him to be able to speak and sing in five languages - Shona, Chichewa, Sena, Venda and Lingala. Growing on a farm, especially before Zimbabwe 's Independence from Britain in 1980, the environment did not offer him many opportunities. In 1983, at the youthful age of 15, he left the farm compounds of Shamva and headed for Harare. Arriving in the capital at the invitation of a relative, who had been inspired by Macheso's guitar-playing prowess at the farm compounds, the two went on a music-inspired journey, joining several bands, mostly sungura-playing outfits. In 1997, he broke ranks with the Khiama Boys fronted by Nicholas Zakaria, to form his own Orchestra Mberikwazvo. He is well known throughout Southern Africa as one of the most successful singers and ranked among the best bass guitarists on the continent. He is Zimbabwe's best-ever selling artiste with his album Simbaradzo being the highest ever sold album in Zimbabwe. Macheso is arguably the best sungura artist to ever emerge from Zimbabwe. In recent years Macheso has risen to become an advertising face for many corporations that include the country's leading bakery Bakers Inn, paint company Nash Paints and humanitarian organisation Red Cross. Macheso's recent achievement was his appointment as ambassador for housing company, which deals with Enhanced Mortgaging and Housing, which targets low-income earners and self-employed clients. Macheso has also used his role to assist fellow artists acquire residential stands at affordable rates. He has ventured into charity and humanitarian work, for instance in May 2019, he started building two classroom blocks at his former primary school in Shamva; Enterprise Primary School. He also offered to pay school fees for 105 less privileged pupils at the same school.

She was once thought to be a male ruler: her outstandingly large mastaba and the royal serekh surrounding her name on several seal impressions previously led Egyptologists and historians to the erroneous belief that she may have been an unknown king.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt - Strategy, Security and Society. Routledge, London 1999, , p. 5 & 174. As the understanding of early Egyptian writings developed, scholars learned that Neithhotep was in fact a woman of extraordinary rank. She was subsequently considered to be the wife of unified Egypt's first pharaoh, Narmer, and the mother of Hor-Aha. More recent discoveries suggest that Neithhotep might have instead been a spouse of Hor- Aha, and the mother and co-regent of successive ruler Djer. Archeological evidence also indicates that she may have ruled as pharaoh in her own right, and as such would have been the earliest known female monarch in history.Owen Jarus: Name of queen Neith-hotep found at Wadj Ameyra. In: Live Science, 19. January 2016 (online). (Englisch)  Identity   Name  Neithhotep's name is connected to Neith, the goddess of war and hunting. This followed a tradition notably practiced during the first dynasty: many queens (such as Merneith/Meritneith, another possible female pharaoh and descendant of Neithhotep) and princesses (such as Aha-Neith, Her-Neith, Nakht-Neith and Qa'-Neith) also had names referencing the deity.Toby A.

At the time Neithhotep ruled, many royal titles for kings and queens hadn't been introduced yet. At this early state of hieroglyphic development, the early Egyptians may not have known yet how to express certain titles. Alternatively, the belief in the dynastic roles of queens was different from what it was in Meritneith's time.Ludwig David Morenz: Bild-Buchstaben und symbolische Zeichen: die Herausbildung der Schrift in der hohen Kultur Alt√§gyptens (Orbis biblicus et orientalis, vol. 205). Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Fribourg/G√∂ttingen 2004, , p. 79.  Attestations  Neithhotep's name was found at Helwan, Abydos and Naqada. It appears on clay seal impressions, on ivory tags, and as inscriptions on stone bowls. Most of the objects were found in her burial complex and in the tombs of Aha and Djer. On several clay seals, Neithhotep's name was written inside a double serekh, and between the merged serekhs perches the divine standard of Neith. One unusual seal impression gives the name Hetepjw.Walter Bryan Emery: √Ñgypten ‚Äì Geschichte und Kultur der Fr√ºhzeit. Fourier, Wiesbaden 1964, , p. 28.  New discoveries  A new discovery site of Neithhotep's name lies in the Wadi Ameyra at the Sinai Peninsula. At the site, several rock carvings date to the kings Iry-Hor, Narmer, Djer and Nebra. King Djer's inscription depicts at its left a procession of royal festive boats, at the right a royal serekh with Djer's name inside. The Horus-falcon atop the serekh holds a war mace, clubbing a kneeling foe. Neith-hotep's name appears at the left side diagonally above the serekh.  Historical evaluations  After the discovery of her mastaba, Neithhotep was thought to be a male ruler: her outstandingly large tomb and the royal serekh bearing her name on several seal impressions led Egyptologists and historians to the erroneous belief that she might have been a yet unknown king. However, as the understanding of early Egyptian writings developed, scholars learned that Neithhotep was in fact a female noble of extraordinary rank. Along with this realization, scholars viewed her now as the wife of king Narmer and mother of Hor-Aha. This view was promoted by clay seal impressions found in her tomb showing the serekhs of Narmer and Aha. Neithhotep's name appears on several clay seal impressions inside a serekh ‚Äì a fashion that was commonly reserved for male rulers only. Secondly, her tomb is of extraordinary size and it has its own cultic enclosure. Such a case is otherwise known only from queen Meritneith. Thirdly are the Wadi Ameyra inscriptions themselves: these reveal that Neithhotep arranged and ordered an expedition through the Wadi in attempt to mine ore and harvest feedstocks. But such an act commonly required royal powers that a mere queen consort didn't have ‚Äì not unless she was in fact an independent, fully authorized ruler.Joachim Willeitner: Die erste Frau auf dem Pharaonenthron. In: Spektrum der Wissenschaft, 16. March 2016 (online). (German) The case of queen Neithhotep shows astonishing similarities to that of queen Meritneith, who had led the royal office for her still minor son, king Hor Den. This realization lead Egyptologists now to the theory that Queen Neithhotep may have also held the royal office for a yet infant child king as some kind of substitute king. Such an act is now known to have been fairly common in early Egyptian times. Royal dynasties were founded in early times by royal mothers, not by inheritance from father to son.Joyce A. Tyldesley: Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt: From Early Dynastic Times to the Death of Cleopatra. Thames & Hudson, 2006, , p. 26-28.Silke Roth: Die K√∂nigsm√ºtter des Alten √Ñgypten von der Fr√ºhzeit bis zum Ende der 12. Dynastie. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2001, , p. 31-33. Some scholars even believe that Neithhotep may be identical to an ominous king Teti listed in the Ramesside king lists and indirectly mentioned on the famous Palermo Stone. The Palermo Stone provides an interregnum between king Aha and Djer by mentioning a \\"double date of death\\" in column I of the event years. The discrepancy between the date of death for Hor-Aha and the second death note spans around 1 year, 1 month and 15 days. Such a time span seems too short for a \\"real\\" ruler such as Hor-Aha, Djer or Wadj. It would rather fit someone who ruled as a substitute for the original pharaoh. And this, in turn, is now proven for Queen Neithhotep. Thus, the ominous entry on the Palermo Stone may indeed be a reference to the interregnum of Queen Neithhotep. This would also explain as to why no contemporary artifact from the 1st Dynasty mentions the royal name Teti, but the others (Itetj and Ita).Werner Kaiser: Zum Siegel mit fr√ºhen K√∂nigsnamen von Umm el-Qaab. In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts, Abteilung Kairo (MDAIK), vol. 43. von Zabern, Mainz 1987, p. 115-121. Equating Queen Neithhotep with Teti I is not commonly accepted. Egyptologists such as Werner Kaiser and Walter B. Emery point to several clay seal fragments with the Horus names of all kings from Narmer to Den. Such seals were discovered in Den's and Queen Meritneith's tombs and they all consequently begin their list with Narmer, who was the husband of Neithhotep. Kaiser and Emery see this as evidence that it was Narmer, not Hor-Aha, who started the First Dynasty. In addition, Kaiser points to seal fragments which mention the name Menj beside the serekh of Narmer. Thus, it is at least likewise possible that Narmer is identical to king Menes. This, in turn, would mean that the cartouche name \\"Teti\\" belongs to Hor-Aha, not to Queen Neithhotep.  Tomb  Mastaba attributed to Neithhotep which is believed to have been built by Hor-Aha. Neithhotep's tomb was discovered in 1897 by French archaeologist Jacques de Morgan at the site of Naqada, who spent just 15 days excavating the structure. The tomb was investigated again by German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt in 1898. John Garstang re-excavated the tomb in 1904 and uncovered hundreds of objects left behind by the previous excavations, around two hundred of which are now housed in the Garstang Museum at the University of Liverpool. The superstructure consisted of a huge mastaba made of hardened mudbricks, of which the outer walls were niched. It is now completely destroyed due to time- conditional erosion. Because of its huge size the tomb was once believed to be that of King Menes. The choice of place for the tomb may indicate that Neithhotep had connections to the ruling elite of a power centre based at Naqada, rather than coming from Lower Egypt, as has been traditionally assumed (based on no evidence). It was once believed that Neithhotep married Narmer in an attempt to facilitate Narmer's unification of Egypt.

Construction Disregarding self-intersecting surfaces, the small hexagonal hexecontahedron can be constructed as a Kleetope of a pentakis dodecahedron. It is therefore a second order Kleetope of the regular dodecahedron. In other words, by adding a shallow pentagonal pyramid to each face of a regular dodecahedron, we get a pentakis dodecahedron. By adding an even shallower triangular pyramid to each face of the pentakis dodecahedron, we get a small hexagonal hexecontahedron. The 60 vertices of degree 3 correspond to the apex vertex of each triangular pyramid of the Kleetope, or to each face of the pentakis dodecahedron. The 20 vertices of degree 12 and 12 vertices of degree 10 correspond to the vertices of the pentakis dodecahedron, and also respectively to the 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons of the truncated icosahedron, the dual solid to the pentakis dodecahedron.

There has reputedly been an inn on this site since 1360, although the core of the current building appears to date from the 18th century with later additions and alterations. If the 1360 foundation date was proved correct it would make The Sheep Heid Inn perhaps the oldest surviving licensed premises in Edinburgh, if not Scotland. Origin of the name Bar of the Sheep Heid Inn In addition to the question of the conjectural date, the origin of the pub's name is also a matter of some debate. From the medieval period to early modern times, sheep were reared in Holyrood Park, a royal park beside Duddingston, and were slaughtered in Duddingston before being taken to the Fleshmarket in Edinburgh's Old Town. There being no great demand for the heads (), the residents of Duddingston village became renowned for their culinary genius with this less than savoury item. Two dishes in particular were widely remarked upon, sheep heid broth (\\"powsowdie\\") and singed sheep heid. The local fame of the latter was even mentioned by Mrs Beeton in her famous cookery book.Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, p.611 Indeed, until the late 19th century the use of these heads was so commonplace that the locals used the skulls as cobbles for their pathways. So the pub's name may originate here. Alternatively, and far more plausibly, its name probably came about following the royal gift in 1580 of an ornate ram's head snuff box, given by King James VI of Scotland. Duddingston village is exactly halfway between the royal residences of Craigmillar Castle and Holyrood Palace, and James, like his mother Mary, Queen of Scots, is said to have stopped here many times and even played skittles in the courtyard behind the pub. As a mark of gratitude he presented the landlord with this highly unusual gift which remained on site for 300 years before being sold at auction to the Earl of Rosebery, whose descendants possess it still at their country seat of Dalmeny House. The pub does, however, possess a 19th-century copy behind its bar. The greater likelihood therefore is that the name was adopted for the pub to mark it apart from the many other taverns known to have existed in the locality.see Duddingston entry in the Old Statistical Account of Scotland History Skittle alley In the intervening centuries The Sheep Heid Inn witnessed many remarkable national events. The various factions of the Covenanting years were wont to stop off as they passed to and fro, as did the Jacobite Army a century later.

The Royal Company of Archers, the City Sheriffs, and the local regiments based at the nearby Piershill Barracks and Duddingston training camps, were all once regulars.

The award- winning independent production company Pioneer Productions of London was commissioned by National Geographic Channels International to produce Human Ape. Pioneer‚Äôs expertise with special effects are showcased in documentary films such as The Living Body, Life Before Birth, In the Womb: Animals, In The Womb: Multiples and The Body Atlas, all of which used wide-ranging techniques to explore the inner world of the living organisms. Human Ape was executive produced by Stuart Carter for Pioneer Productions and directed by Martin Gorst. It was commissioned by Sydney Suissa, Executive Vice President (Content), National Geographic Channels International, and distributed by National Geographic Channel and Granada International. The show was aired on both the US and internationally on National Geographic Channel beginning in March 2008. Human Ape includes brief actual footage of human and ape activities in controlled experiments, as well as state-of-the-art computer- generated imagery (CGI) to examine the relationship between humankind and our simian cousins, with whom we share 99% of our genetic material. It also tracks the progress of a human and ape from the womb to early development and beyond, analysing how both develop cognitive abilities, communicate through emotions and language, use violence and sex, and utilise tools to manipulate their environment. Bonobos and orangutans living at Great Ape Trust of Iowa are prominently featured in the documentary film. Bonobos Kanzi and Panbanisha and orangutans Knobi and Azy are extensively shown in the film, with detailed inputs from the Great Ape Trust scientists, Dr. Rob Shumaker, director of orangutan research, and William Fields, director of bonobo research. The Pioneer Productions crew filmed at Great Ape Trust in April 2007, where footage included mirror self-recognition exercises. It also includes some exciting experiments like the apes counting and identifying the numbers from 1 to 10, not only with accuracy, but also with such speed that would put a human to shame. Whereas the human child is shown to be imitating the steps taken by one researcher to open a box and get a reward, the apes quickly eliminate the redundant steps. Such experiments are counter-intuitive and offer great deal of insights into the inner wiring and workings of the human and simian brains. The film also briefly touches upon the relationship between the modified FOXP2 gene and the human language development. It documents a British family with a mutated FOXP2 gene which severely affects speech of its members. Stuart Carter, Managing Director, Pioneer Productions was quoted by the website: \\"We have long had a fascination with our genetic similarities to apes, and this film explores the question of how far these similarities go.

He was lord of Bekkerzeel, Zellik, Kobbegem, Berchem and Fenain. Life Jan Casembroot was born in Brugge, where he descended from an important family, originally from Piemonte. His father Lenaert Casembroot (1495-1558) was mayor of Brugge and his mother was Maria Reyvaert. He married Wilhelmina van Brockhorst, and had a daughter named Anna with her. He was secretary of Lamoral, Count of Egmont and he signed the Compromise of Nobles, in whose name he offered the Petition (Smeekschrift) to regentes Margaret of Parma on April 5, 1566, in which the nobles pleaded for religious freedom. Jan Casembroot was a Catholic, but became a fierce opponent of Cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle. He also opposed the Beeldenstorm. Jan Casembroot was named governor of Oudenaarde by the count of Egmont, and managed to restore order in the city. In the agreement that he signed with the calvinists, he went further than the regents had stipulated in the Accord of 25 August 1566. He was arrested together with the count of Egmont on 9 September 1567, tortured and condemned to death on 9 August 1568 by the Council of Troubles led by the Fernando Alvarez de Toledo Duke of Alva, and beheaded together with Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem on 14 September 1568 at Vilvoorde. Several of his Latin poems were published, which reportedly display a humanistic sensibility.

History  The section of the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA&MR;) between (then known as Glossop) and opened to public traffic on 8 August 1844, but initially there was no station between and Woodhead. At the start of 1847, the SA&MR; amalgamated with other companies to form the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;). On 1 August 1897, the MS&LR; was renamed the Great Central Railway and this was merged with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway on 1 January 1923.  Operation  A local millowner, Brown & Co., donated ¬£50 towards the cost of providing a station at Crowden. Plans were drawn up in April 1857, but the MS&LR; decided that the sum of ¬£400 was too much and dropped the idea; however, they did not return the donation. When Brown & Co. complained in May 1860 about their loss, the plan was revived and the station was built, with the MS&LR; meeting the balance of the ¬£450 total cost. George Benton of Glossop was contracted for the building work, but the necessary road improvements were provided by Manchester Corporation; the station being adjacent to the dam at the lower end of the Woodhead Reservoir, which belonged to Manchester Corporation. The station was opened on 1 July 1861.  Closure  The station was closed on 4 February 1957 but passenger trains continued to pass through the station until January 1970. The station continued to see freight trains travel through until July 1981, when the line between Hadfield and Penistone was closed completely.

Kelly. A Shaggy defense is a legal strategy in which the defendant denies that they were the one witnessed or recorded committing an alleged act. The strategy's name is derived from reggae musician Shaggy's 2000 single \\"It Wasn't Me\\", which is based on the concept; it was coined by Slate writer Josh Levin in 2008 to describe the defense used by singer R. Kelly while he was on trial for child pornography charges. Origin \\"It Wasn't Me\\" by reggae musician Shaggy was released in September 2000 as the first single from his fifth album Hot Shot, eventually reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and other countries. The lyrics of the song depict one man asking his friend what to do after his girlfriend catches him having sex with another woman. His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \\"It wasn't me\\". As the narrator describes all the evidence his girlfriend has against him, from a video recording to witnessing the cheating herself, his friend adamantly repeats \\"it wasn't me\\". Ultimately, the narrator says that the advice \\"makes no sense at all\\". On February 3, 2002, a video surfaced allegedly showing popular R&B; musician R. Kelly statutorily raping, and urinating on, an underage girl. The story, which was released by an unknown source, was sent to the Chicago Sun-Times, the newspaper that broke the story on February 8, 2002. This news surfaced as Kelly was to perform at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics. In interviews with WMAQ television of Chicago and MTV News, Kelly said that he was not the man in the video. In June 2002, Kelly was indicted in Chicago on 21 counts of child pornography. That same month, Kelly was apprehended by the Miami Police Department on a Chicago arrest warrant. The case earned media attention, and Kelly's insistence that he was not the man on the video as his only line of defense earned mockery. As comedian Chris Rock commented on the case during his 2004 stand up special Never Scared, \\"What the fuck is wrong with R. Kelly? He's got a lot of balls, ok? Talkin' about 'it ain't me'. Got a damn sex tape out, 'it ain't me'. Motherfucker we know what you look like!\\" When the case went to trial in 2007, Kelly based his defense on denying that it was him in the video, which led Slate writer Josh Levin to coin the term the \\"Shaggy defense\\" in reference to the song to describe Kelly's strategy: \\"I predict that in the decades to come, law schools will teach this as the 'Shaggy defense'. You allege that I was caught on camera, butt naked, banging on the log cabin floor? It wasn't me.\\"Josh Levin. May 21, 2008. \\"Dispatches From the R. Kelly Trial\\". Levin repeated the term on NPR.NPR. May 23, 2008. \\"Trapped in a Courtroom: The R. Kelly Trial\\". Ultimately, Kelly was found not guilty on all charges. Shaggy performing a song in 2009 According to Josh Levin of Slate, \\"As Kelly's lawyers mentioned multiple times, the alleged victim in this case‚Äînow a 23-year-old woman‚Äîtold a grand jury that it wasn't her. While 15 friends and relatives testified that the girl in question was indeed on the video, neither the alleged victim nor her parents showed up in court to testify for either side.\\" The prosecution witness Lisa Van Allen was easily impeached as a witness due to her clearly sordid history with R. Kelly, others, and even soliciting a bribe from an investigator in the case. One juror told the Chicago Tribune, \\"At some point we said there was a lack of evidence.\\" Use While the term remains most commonly associated with the R. Kelly trial, it has been subsequently used to describe any case where the defendant simply denies guilt in the face of overwhelming evidence. For example, in the 2010 Virginia court case Preston v. Morton, in which an allegation against a driver accused of striking a man with a tractor trailer while he was installing traffic lights was refuted by the defendant claiming that he was not the one driving the truck in question, U.S. District Judge Jackson Kiser specifically cited the alleged driver as using the Shaggy defense in his written judgement. Writing about the case, Josh Levin noted the endurance of the term he coined: \\"The Shaggy defense, like the jury system and the principle of habeas corpus, is one of the pillars underpinning American jurisprudence.\\" Additionally in 2010, Chris Hayes accused BP of using the Shaggy defense over their refusal to accept responsibility for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In 2013, The Atlantic accused the United States Department of Justice of using the Shaggy defense in regards to their refusal to respond to a lawsuit filed against them by the American Civil Liberties Union over the CIA's use of unmanned drones in warfare by claiming that the program was a state secret, even though it had been acknowledged and even defended multiple times by the Obama administration. In February 2019, Virginia governor Ralph Northam was accused of using the Shaggy defense after photographs from his medical school yearbook page surfaced showing a man in blackface next to a man wearing Ku Klux Klan robes. When the story first came out, Northam stated that he apologized for being in the image. However, a day later, Northam changed his story, claiming that it wasn't him. Multiple commentators, including CNN political analyst April Ryan and Michael Eric Dyson cited the R&B; song in their remarks on his conflicting explanations.

Munger, Sr. (January 20, 1911 - July 11, 1999) was a Minnesota politician and a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from northeastern Minnesota. First elected in 1954, he was re-elected to four more terms before running for the Minnesota Senate in 1964. Unsuccessful in that bid, he ran for the House again in 1966, and was re-elected every two years until his death in 1999. He holds the record as the longest-serving member of the House at over 42 years and seven months. Early years and political interest Munger was born in Fergus Falls and attended Fergus Falls High School, graduating in 1932. While still in high school, he supported the openly socialist Nonpartisan League. Nonpartisan League founder Arthur C. Townley became a close friend. He also campaigned for Farmer-Laborer Governor Floyd B. Olson, a confessed radical who had Nonpartisan League roots. He attended the University of Minnesota and settled in Duluth, where he was a motel owner and operator for many years. Before serving in the legislature, Munger worked with the marketing division of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, and with grain inspection for the Minnesota Railroad and Warehouse Commission. He was unsuccessful in his first bid for office in 1934 when he ran for the state House on the Farmer-Laborer party ticket. Later, he was active in the establishment and development of the Lake Superior Zoo. Legislative and environmental leadership As a Democrat, Munger represented the old districts 59, 59B and 7A in the House, with the district boundaries and numeration changing somewhat through redistricting every ten years. As the legislature was officially non-partisan until the 1974 elections, he caucused with the Liberal Caucus until declaration of party affiliation became a prerequisite for candidacy. His district included portions of St. Louis County, primarily centered around the western part of the city of Duluth. Over time, Munger came to be known as Minnesota's \\"Mr. Environment.\\"\\"Munger returns in \\"Mr. Environment\\" - Star Tribune 3/3/2009 Retrieved 2010-07-20. He earned a reputation as a pioneer, leader and activist in environmental legislation. He chaired the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee from 1973 until his death, excepting a brief interlude when Republicans controlled the House. His most noted legislative accomplishments included the passage of the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund Act, the Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling Act of 1989, the Reinvest in Minnesota (RIM) Program, the Groundwater Protection Act of 1989, the Toxic Pollution Prevention Act, and the Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991. He also led the effort to establish the Energy Task Force to Develop Alternative Energy Resource, helped secure millions of state and federal dollars to clean up the St. Louis River, and led campaigns to fund research into frog deformities and to ban the use of DDT insecticide.http://www.leg.mn/archive/LegDB/Articles/10443SessWeekly1998.pdf Besides chairing the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee, Munger also chaired the Penal Institutions Committee during the 1959-1960 legislative biennium, and the Elections Committee during the 1961-1962 biennium. Through the years, he was a member of the Appropriations, the Capital Investment, the Energy and Utilities, the General Legislation, Veterans Affairs and Elections, the Metropolitan and Urban Affairs, the Rules and Legislative Administration, and the Ways and Means committees, and of various committee incarnations and subcommittees relevant to each. Death and legacy Munger died of liver cancer on July 11, 1999, and was buried in Oneota Cemetery in Duluth. At the time of his death, he was also the oldest legislator in Minnesota history.

The wingbox is so called since, on many designs, the combination of the forward and rear wing spars and the upper and lower wing skins together form a natural \\"box\\" shape running through the wing. While internal wing structure commonly provides much of the strength via a combination of spars, ribs and stringers, the external skin also typically carries a proportion of the loads too. On many aircraft, the inner volume of the wingbox has also be used to store fuel, which is commonly referred to as being a wet wing design. In recent years, there has been an increasing use of composite materials within the wingbox; this trend has largely been pursued to achieve lower weights over designs only using conventional materials. Specifically, carbon fibre has become a popular material due to its very high strength-to-weight ratio. During January 2017, European aerospace conglomerate Airbus Group announced that they had created the world's first single-piece composite center wingbox, stating that it represented a 20 per cent reduction in the cost of manufacture by being easier to assemble.  Evaluating and Testing  Due to its crucial structural role, the wingbox is subjected to considerable analysis and scrutiny in order to be certain of its capabilities, as well to achieve optimum performance. As such, various techniques to calculate and verify the stresses involved have been devised by aerospace engineers and employed by aircraft manufacturers. The use of increasingly capable calculations and tests has been directly credited with enabling the production of lighter and more efficient wings. Towards the latter part of the twentieth century, the use of computer aided design (CAD) technology became commonplace in aerospace programmes; as such, software packages such as CATIA plays a major role in the design and manufacturing process. Furthermore, physical verification of the structural performance of the wingbox is normally demanded in the certification process of civil airliners by the certification authorities. Accordingly, it is commonplace for aircraft manufacturers to produce non-flying test units which are subjected to ground-based testing, exerting loads of up to 1.5 times the maximum aerodynamic forces expected to be encountered at any point throughout its operating life. Destructive testing of wing elements has been around since the earliest days of aviation, although the specific techniques employed have become increasingly sophisticated, particularly since the invention of the strain gauge in 1938, which has been in widespread use within the aerospace industry since the Second World War. Non-destructive testing is also performed not only during the initial certification process but often throughout an individual aircraft's life to safeguard against fatigue failure or inspect potential damage inflicted. Common techniques include visual inspection, ultrasonic testing, radiographic testing, electromagnetic testing, acoustic emissions, and shearography. Sometimes, via such techniques, the need to replace an individual aircraft's wingbox is identified; although this is a quite intensive and costly procedure, leading to operators often choosing to end an aircraft's operating life instead, such replacements are occasionally performed. During Summer 2019, the United States Air Force was compelled to ground over 100 of its Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules transport aircraft upon discovering excessive wingbox cracking for inspection and remedial work. Aircraft intended for lengthy service lives have often received replacement wingboxes as a part of life extension programmes.

It was discovered in 1977. Discovery La Mansonni√®re cave was discovered by the Speleo Club du Rond Point de L'Aigle (SCRPLA) in 1977. The discovery was published in the bulletin printed by La MJC de l'Aigle and was reported to the French Federation of Speleology at the St Etienne de Rouvray Conference. Origins The Cave was originally called \\"La Grotte de Bellou sur Huisne\\", after the name of the local commune in south eastern Orne county, Normandy. It lies in a disused chalk mine used at the time as a mushroom farm. The entrances were walled up, but permission was obtained to gain entry to the labyrinth, referred to by the mushroom workers as 'clay pockets'. It was clear that extensive digging could link up the truncated sections to lengthen the cave from 140 metres to more than one kilometre, making it one of the longest chalk caves. The tunnels are about 1.5 metres high but are extensively choked with sediment. Exploration French cavers later renamed the cave and engaged in extensive digging, removing much of the valuable varve deposits which the SCRPLA had hoped to preserve for study by professional soil scientists. The SCRPLA produced a study of the cave which has since been added to by other groups. The cave suffered considerable vandalism when the mushroom farm ceased activity, but has since been re-gated. The cave is not related to any current hydrogeological system. There are very extensive (30 km) active karst systems under the nearby Pays d'Ouche district although extensive exploration by the SCRPLA has not managed to penetrate any of these. However, they have located detailed descriptions of at least one cave explored by the Parisian water authorities in the nineteenth century. For more information on Chalk karst, the works of the great pioneer speleologist A.E.Martel should be consulted.

Journalism After studying law and letters at the University of Pisa Ferretti became a journalist, interrupting his career for army service in the First World War.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 125 Following the war he worked for the Italian administration in the newly added territory of Trentino. He then returned to journalism, serving as director of La Gazzetta dello Sport from 1919 to 1924, editor of the Il Secolo XIX from 1924 to 1926 and editor of the Corriere della Sera from 1927 to 1928. Fascism Ferretti was an early member of the National Fascist Party and was in the Lamarmora column during the March on Rome. He held a number of positions afterwards, notably head of the journalists syndicate, which he dominated along with Giorgio Pini and Telesio Interlandi, a deputy from 1924 to 1940, a member of the Grand Fascist Council and an officer in the Blackshirts. In 1926 he was appointed press secretary to Benito Mussolini and in 1928 was promoted to head of the official press office, a role in which he significantly expanded state censorship. Ferretti particularly focused on the regional press, which had often been ignored by central government, and forced it to adhere to a Professional code of conduct that he established in order to ensure a pro-fascist outlook.Doug Thompson, State Control in Fascist Italy: Culture and Conformity, 1925-43, Manchester University Press, 1991, p. 129 To this end he established a propaganda section of the press office.Christopher Rundle, Publishing Translations in Fascist Italy, p. 15 Ferretti's reforms even covered the reporting of crime, financial incompetence or the failure of businesses and banks, all of which were severely restricted due to fears that they might reflect badly on the government, which consistently claimed Italy was only progressing in both economic and social terms.Thompson, State Control in Fascist Italy, p. 130 Ferretti was succeeded as press office chief by Gaetano Polverelli in December 1931. Ferretti also served as president of the Italian National Olympic Committee and president of the Premio Letteraria Viareggio prize from 1931 to 1939. He was effectively the head of sport in fascist Italy and used his position to campaign vigorously for an increase in participation in sport, linking it to fascist notions of vitality and the development of a disciplined military spirit.Gigliola Gori, Italian Fascism and the Female Body: Sport, Submissive Women and Strong Mothers, Routledge, 2012, pp. 110‚Äì111 He was particularly influential in the growth of rugby union in Italy, lauding the game in the pages of the Corriere della Sera for its \\"extreme virile physical effort\\".Timothy J.L. Chandler, John Nauright, Making the Rugby World: Race, Gender, Commerce, Routledge, 2013, pp. 90‚Äì91 The Italy national rugby union team made its debut in 1929, during the country's fascist period. Recognising the importance of sport to national identity, as well as the popular status of those skilled at sport, he sought to portray Mussolini himself as \\"Italy's first and most complete sportsman\\" and arranged for Il Duce to be regularly photographed horse-riding, skiing, hunting, motor racing, swimming or even just in attendance at sports events.Simon Martin, Sport Italia: The Italian Love Affair with Sport, I.B.Tauris, 2011, p. 64 Ferretti continued to write for the Corriere della Sera during the Republic of Sal√≤. He remained close to Mussolini until the end, fleeing with him to Como in 1945. Post-war politics Ferretti was an early member of the Italian Social Movement and served the party as a member of the Italian Senate for Lazio. From 1959 to 1969 he was also a member of the European Parliament.

This site was formerly available in English via Yahoo!, where it was known as Yahooligans! until December 2006, and in Korean via Yahoo! Korea. The website is used for both educational and entertainment purposes. It was established in March 1996 by Yahoo! to give children a venue to find appropriate, safe Internet content. Yahoo! Kids was the oldest online search directory for children. Yahoo! Kids was discontinued in English on April 30, 2013 and Korean earlier in the year, allowing the company to redirect its resources to mobile applications. History Yahoo! Kids, originally known as Yahooligans!, was founded in March 1996 by Yahoo! to provide children with a venue to find appropriate, safe Internet content. The website was the oldest online search directory for children. The website's editors stated that Yahoo! Kids was \\"cool, goofy, fascinating, fun, hysterical, philosophical, surprising, sedate, silly, seismic, popular, obscured, useful, and interesting\\". In October 1999, The New York Times reporter Michelle Slatalla noted that Yahooligans! was a \\"heavily trafficked site\\", with 463,000 visitors accessing the website in August 1999. In October 1999, the website received an Alexa Internet rank of 991 out of 22 million content websites. In 2004, Yahoo! entered into a partnership with DIC Entertainment to establish Yahooligans! TV, which gave users access to DIC's 3,000 hours of animated children programs. DIC Entertainment president Brad Brooks stated that the partnership \\"offer[ed] advertisers a cross platform purchase\\". Yahoo! sold the ads and the revenue from the commercials was split between the two companies. Content The website was used for both educational and entertainment purposes. The Yahoo! Kids' portal had directories such as \\"Around the World\\", \\"Arts & Entertainment\\", \\"Computers & Games\\", \\"School Bell\\", \\"Science & Nature\\", and \\"Sports & Recreation\\". Under the directory \\"School Bell\\", the category \\"Homework Answers\\" allowed children to access websites pertaining to school subjects such as geography, history, and math. Under \\"Around the World\\", children could learn about countries, politics, and history. The \\"Art Soup\\" directory taught children about museums and drama, and the \\"Scoop\\" let them look at comics and newspapers. It had an Associated Press section to let children read age-appropriate articles. The parents' section of the website contained advice about being safe while browsing the Internet and links to services that \\"block and filter websites\\". The teachers' section contained lesson plans for \\"planning, implementing and assessing integrated units\\". It was separated into three ranks: kindergarten through second grade, third through fifth grade, and sixth to eighth grade. Educational professionals and former teachers screened each website listed in Yahooligans. The homepage displayed links to games, jokes, news, and sports. For the latter three, the content was crafted for those younger than 12. Yahooligans! directed viewers to child-friendly websites like those from Smithsonian Institution and Louvre. It adopted the persona of Bill Clinton's pet cat, Socks, to introduce viewers to the White House's website in 1995. Games provided on the Yahoo! Kids website included Chinese checkers, Go Fish, and Checkers. Age-appropriate offsite games were also accessible via the links under the \\"games\\" tab. The website offered an instant messaging gadget that allowed children to participate in live chats with notable people, such as Bill Clinton, J. K. Rowling, and Bill Nye the Science Guy. In March 2011, Yahoo! Kids partnered with the TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars near the season's finale to have children pose questions to Chewbacca. Question submissions were posted on SurveyMonkey, and Yahoo! Kids posted Chewbacca's answers on March 28. The approximately three minute long video consisted of Chewbacca pantomiming responses to queries such as \\"How do you deal with all that hair?\\" Reviews In August 1996, Greg Mefford of The Galveston Daily News (later renamed to The Daily News) stated that Yahooligans is \\"as much fun as it is educational, with links to darn near everything\\". Kokomo Tribune columnist Amy Irick wrote in January 1998 that Yahooligans! was a \\"great alternative to the Yahoo! search engine for younger computer users\\". In August 1999, Irick said that Yahooligans! was \\"very user friendly, just like its parent Yahoo!\\" and that its teachers' guide is a \\"must see for teachers\\". Indiana Gazettes John Smathers wrote in June 2002, \\"I can't mention kids sites without mentioning Yahooligans.com\\", praising the website as a \\"great tool to teach kids more about Internet surfing\\". In June 2005, reviewer Gail Junion- Metz of the School Library Journal praised Yahooligans! Games, writing that it is \\"[o]ne of the best spots to find kid-appropriate games that don't require downloads\\". In a September 1998 review of the website, John Hilvert and Linda Bruce of PC User (now named TechLife) wrote that \\"Yahooligans is one of the best specialized engines, particularly for homework answers.\\" In July 2007, reviewer Holly Gunn of Teacher Librarian praised Yahoo! Kids for its helpful, comprehensible results but criticized it for having an interface filled with too many ads and that was \\"too busy and filled with too many diversions. Useful material is buried amidst entertainment\\". Closure Yahoo! Kids closed on April 30, 2013. In February 2013, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer told an investor conference that the company aimed to reduce their 70 products to 12, increasing their attention on mobile device applications. In an April 19, 2013, blog post announcing Yahoo! Kids' closure, Yahoo! Executive Vice president of Platforms Jay Rossiter wrote: > [W]e want to bring you experiences that inspire and entertain you every day. > That means taking a hard look at all of our products to make sure they are > still central to your daily habits. As part of that ongoing effort, today we > are shutting down a few more products. He said that Yahoo! would redirect those resources to newer products like e-mail and weather mobile applications. Rossiter wrote that Yahoo!'s \\"youngest users\\" could continue using the company's services. Children younger than 13 could create a Yahoo! account through Yahoo!'s Family Accounts program. Young users could also find age-appropriate movies through the \\"Family Movies\\" section of Yahoo! Movies.

He is best known for his operas which followed in the same vein of Gioachino Rossini. He also produced works for solo piano, a small amount of sacred music, and some chamber music.Francesco Bussi. \\"Lillo, Giuseppe\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2001. Life and career Born in Galatina in the Province of Lecce, Lillo was the son of conductor Giosu√® Lillo. He received his earliest musical training from his father before entering the Naples Conservatory where he studied harmony and counterpoint with Giovanni Furno, piano with Francesco Lanza, and composition with Niccol√≤ Antonio Zingarelli. His first composition, a mass for four voices and orchestra, premiered to a warm reception in 1834. As a composer Lillo primarily composed music for the stage. His first opera, La moglie per 24 ore, ossia L‚Äôammalato di buona salute, premiered successfully at the Real Collegio di Musica during Carnival of 1834. He quickly gained a great deal of popularity with the Naples public with opera serias like Il gioiello (1835), Odda di Bernaver (1837), and Il conte di Chalais (1839). The pinnacle of his success came with his only opera comica, L‚Äôosteria di Andujar, which premiered in Fondo on 30 September 1840. After 1840, Lillo composed several more operas up through 1853, most of which were received with poor or mediocre responses. He was never able to re-obtain the popularity that he had enjoyed earlier in his career. Around 1840 Lillo was appointed joint music director of the Teatro di San Carlo with Giacomo Cordella. He also began teaching piano in the early 1840s. He joined the faculty of the Naples Conservatory sometime around 1850, eventually being appointed professor of harmony in 1859; a position he held until his death in Naples four year later.

Bocafloja began his musical career in the mid-1990s with the groups Lifestyle (1996‚Äì1998) and Microphonk (1999). As a solo artist since 2000, he released his demo EP album Lengua Insurrecta in 2002. Bocafloja burst on the Mexican hip hop scene with the release of his debut album, Pienso Luego Existo, in 2003. Followed by the successes of Jazzyturno in 2004, A Titulo Personal in 2005, El Manual de la Otredad in 2007, and Existo: Matriz Preludio al Pienso in 2009, Bocafloja has transgressed into one of the most revered icons in the hip hop scene in Mexico. Lyrically Bocafloja critically addresses topics such as institutionalized racism, social and political oppression, mental slavery, colonialism, and other human conditions. Bocafloja's most recent album Patolog√≠as del Invisible Inc√≥modo, released in 2012, is a concept album which narrates the experience of the body of the oppressed as a vehicle of transgression to hegemonic structures. Bocafloja is projected to release by 2014, a music video for each of the album's 16 tracks. Bocafloja is recognized in Mexico as the pioneer of the utilization of hip hop culture as an alternative tool to create awareness, developing a different form for political participation that reaches and is more relevant to marginalized youth. Bocafloja lives in New York City. Biography Early days (1995‚Äì1999) Bocafloja, like many other young people in Mexico, was first exposed to hip hop thanks to immigration patterns between the United States and Mexico. Bocafloja was drawn to rap music from a young age even without fully understanding hip hop culture. His initial musical influences were completely varied, referencing hip hop artists from the United States, given at the time Spanish language rappers were limited if not non-existent. In 1993 groups of young people who were fans of hip hop in Mexico City began to come together at small house parties. The number of youth that were associated with the hip hop scene during the early 1990s was relatively small, most of them knowing each other personally. In 1995 Bocafloja began to write his own rhymes but did not start recording until 1996. His first tracks were recorded in rudimentary home studios. Bocafloja's early rhymes reflected his adolescence and state of maturity, mimicking the excesses of commercialism: money, women, etc. It was not until years later as Bocafloja passed through a process of political awareness, in 1999, when the content of his lyrics dramatically changed as a natural product of personal transformation. Professional career (2000‚Äìpresent) In 2002 Bocalfoja released his demo EP album Lengua Insurrecta. The album, which established Bocafloja as a solo artist, represented a radical departure from his previous musical projects in his initial career with its politically infused lyrics. The LP contains 6 songs and was distributed by hand and gained underground popularity by word of mouth. 2003 marked the release of Pienso Luego Existo whose subject matter struck cords among his peers and established Bocafloja with respect and following within the burgeoning hip hop community in Mexico City and beyond. With many of the tracks the artist recounts his experiences of life in the second largest metropolis in the world and critiques the political and religious systems within the country. The album spawned several hit singles which became instant classics, \\"Chillatown\\", \\"Los Diez Mandamientos\\", \\"Avasallando\\" and \\"Pasado, Presente, y Futuro\\". Bocafloja utilized the production of ED One and collaborated with fellow MC's JR (now known as Akil Ammar), SPIA, Epik and NedMan. In 2004, Bocafloja released Jazzyturno. A departure from his previous album with jazz-infused beats. Noteworthy singles include \\"El D√≠a de mi Suerte\\" which samples Hector Lavoe's song of the same title, \\"Mi Gente\\", \\"Mujer Ser\\" and \\"Sector Lucido\\". The album features collaborations with Akil Ammar, Miguel Contreras, Skool 77, and Ximbo. Tracks are produced by Skool 77, Ed-One, Matheus Pinguim, Mother Tongue Productions, Nemezyz Beats, Nugit Productions, and Ximbo. Bocafloja Performance, Vive Latino, Mexico, 2010In 2005 Bocafloja released A Titulo Personal. The album, produced in grand part by Soulman, contains tracks with a soulful feel. The album contains the hit single \\"Tiempo\\", which has proven to be Bocafloja's most famous single. The video \\"Tiempo\\" gained popularity with frequent media rotation on various cable and network channels in Mexico. A Titulo Personal features collaborations with Menuda Coincidencia, Nico Royale (Italy), and Denisse of the group Anastasias (Brazil). The album's success gave way for Bocafloja's to win the DJ & Clubbing Awards' Hip Hop Artist of the Year Award 2006 in Mexico. El Manual de la Otredad, the artist's fourth full-length album, was released in 2007. In this album Bocafloja experiments with a new sound, utilizing stylized mainstream hip hop beats. It was the artist's intent to juxtapose fiercely politically charged lyrics with beats that the hip hop community would deem \\"commercial.\\" The album's singles included \\"Aut√≥nomo\\" and \\"Soulrebel\\" and contains collaborations with Malena Actitud Maria Marta (Argentina), Moyenei (Chile), Tek-One (Puerto Rico), and SieteNueve (Puerto Rico). For the album El Manual de la Otredad Bocafloja was awarded Hip Hop Album of the Year 2008 by the Indie-O Awards in Mexico. The album has also been the subject of several academic studies and research projects in the United States and Latin America for its poetic contribution and connection with political processes. Bocafloja performance, Festival de las Resistencias, Mexico City, 2010Existo: Matriz Preludio al Pienso, released in 2009, was the first album Bocafloja wrote and released after moving to the United States in 2008. Existo's sound is reminiscent of early 1990s classic hip hop albums with its jazz-influenced beats‚Äîa trademark of Bocafloja. The album's content does not cease to push the envelope with Bocafloja's politically infused lyric, but \\"Existo\\" stands out among previous albums with its sophisticated poetic discourse. The majority of the tracks are produced by Nuff Ced (Puerto Rico), Yallzee (Puerto Rico), and Jim B (Spain). Bocafloja collaborates with classic global hip hop artists, such as Afu-Ra, Velco (Puerto Rico), Hache ST (Dominican Republic) and Cambio from the group Para la Gente, with whom Bocafloja has formed an artistic alliance. \\"Quilombo\\" and \\"Las Estaciones\\", which was produced by Hexsagon, are the album's top singles. In 2012, Bocafloja released Patolog√≠as del Invisible Inc√≥modo. In this album, Bocafloja deals with the concept of the body as a vehicle of transgression toward hegemony. It is a project that speaks about the invisibility of people of color and the discomfort that individuals cause in certain settings. The album is composed of 16 soul and jazz-infused beats with profound, insightful, and always critical lyricism. The artist's website is quoted as stating, \\"Patolog√≠as del Invisible Inc√≥modo is a concept album, where the interconnection & interdependence of each track signifies and globalizes a musical and discursive experience. It is not about a collection of singles.\\" In this album, Bocafloja features collaborations with his fellow Quilomboarte collective, Cambio, Hache ST, Michelle Ricardo and Fabian Villegas, as well as Moyenei, Favi, Gabriel Teodoros, Siaira Harris, Alexandra Blakely, Guerrilla Queenz, Hollis Wong, R.E.A.L.I.D.A.D., and Indee Styla. Tracks are produced by Jim B, Danny B, Best Quality, Vnerable, Andino, Hexsagon, BeanOne, Kajmir, SK1, and Aaron Moore. Bocafloja has shared the stage with such artists as Dead Prez, Afu-Ra, Bahamadia, Tony Touch, Ozomatli, MV Bill (Brazil), Brother Ali, J-Live, The Beatnuts, Freestyle Fellowship, Immortal Technique, K'naan, Rascalz, Intifada (Puerto Rico), Actitud Maria Marta (Argentina), and SieteNueve (Puerto Rico), among others. Personal life Bocafloja and his wife, Monica Haro Garcia met in Mexico City, Mexico in 2006 and later married in 2008, in New York City. The couple has one child, son Emir Villegas-Garcia (born 2009). Bocafloja lives with his family in New York City. Literary projects In 2008 Bocafloja is in collaboration with Fabi√°n Villegas published ImaRginaci√≥n: La po√©tica del Hip Hop como desmesura de lo pol√≠tico. ImaRginacion es una colecci√≥n de poemas y ensayos que exploran la posibilidad de otorgarle un nuevo significado a lo pol√≠tico desarmando el discurso dominante del saber sometido. El texto invita al lector a un viaje en donde la resistencia, la rabia, la dignidad, el placer, el deseo, la lucha y la creaci√≥n se unen en un profundo proceso en busca de la emancipaci√≥n. ImaRginacion is the first literary project produced by members of the Hip Hop community in Mexico and is one of the first of its kind in the rest of Latin America and the Spanish speaking countries. Social and political views Bocafloja understands the inherent political nature of hip hop, as a musical genre born out of marginalized communities worldwide. For that reason he utilizes his musical and literary careers as a manifestation of resistance and political participation. Bocafloja's lyrics harshly critique the oppressive nature of capitalism and first world imperialism. He has been influenced by Black and Brown political struggles throughout history. Bocafloja has been connected with several political organizations that support emancipatory and anti-colonial struggles.

The city flourished from the Late Classical to the Roman times and was named after the Thesprotean tribe of Elinoi that lived in the region. It is estimated that, during the period of its peak, the population of the city reached 6000. The walls are reinforced by rectangular towers and date to the 4th century BC. The west wall was added in the Hellenistic period in order to incorporate the little port into the fortified area. Throughout the settlement are visible foundations of buildings, some of which are hewn from the rock, as well as cisterns, while at the centre of the hilltop is an open space (\\"Acropolis A\\") around which were probably clustered the public buildings of the city.

The small amusement park operated between 1891 and 1971. History Silver Beach opened as a resort in 1891 when local businessmen in boat building Logan Drake and Louis D. Wallace built vacation cottages as Silver Beach Amusement and Realty Company along Lake Michigan. Construction of buildings such as a pavilion followed and were completed in 1896. After the park was established, two of the earliest aviators, Augustus Moore Herring and Logan Archbold Vilas, used the beach to experiment with aircraft, the latter being the first person to fly across Lake Michigan when he flew from Silver Beach to Chicago. The first roller coaster, Chase through the Clouds, opened in 1905; it was replaced in 1923 by another coaster, the Velvet (later \\"the Comet\\"). Also added in 1905 were a roller rink, with a pipe organ included in 1906, both firsts in the region, and a boxing ring, with matches organized by boxer Tommy Ryan. A dance hall opened in 1907, replaced by the Shadowland Ballroom in 1927; performers would include the founders of MCA Inc., founded after Drake encouraged two performers to create the endeavor. In the ensuing decades, the park expanded, including the additions of a ferris wheel, miniature train, children's amusement ride area, and miniature golf course, and maintained continued popularity due in part to the owners providing steamboat access from Chicago. In what has become an icon of Silver Beach,Silver Beach Carousel Society a carousel had been added by 1916, taking advantage of the enlarged area of beach sand created by Lake Michigan in the years during the park's operation. Silver Beach's success continued until the 1960s, when crime and unrest became much more common, and closed on August 10, 1970 due to the escalating problems including a violent incident on July 4, 1969. The park attempted to recover but did not reopen after the 1971 season. Rides and attractions were sold and the amusement park was abandoned; the remaining structures were demolished starting in 1975.

On 21 January 1925, she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Sieglinde in Die Walk√ºre. The next day, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times: ‚Äúyoung Czech soprano...was warmly welcomed. She has a fresh and youthful voice, a little small for the demands of her role, much grace and sincerity as an actress. Not often is the figure of Sieglinde so human, so tender and so appealing to the beholder.\\" The same year she sang Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni. She sang a total of 196 performances at the Metropolitan Opera between 1925 and 1935. She sang there in a number of American premieres including Franco Alfano's Madonna Imperia (8 February 1928), Pizzetti's Fra Gherardo (29 March 1929), also in the opera ≈†vanda the Bagpiper by the Czech-American composer Jarom√≠r Weinberger (11 July 1931), and Simon Boccanegra (29 January 1932).

Gameplay David Crane's Amazing Tennis simulates the men's singles game across three set matches, the game is viewed from behind the player. Clay, grass and hard courts are available, and the player can specify handedness. There are a selection of fictional computer controlled opponents available, each with different strengths, and a two player local multiplayer option is available. Players can perform various shots, such as topspin, backspin, lob and drop shots. Reception The player prepares to serve The game enjoyed a positive critical reception. The presentation was lauded, Super Play described the impression of a 3D court as \\"the most realistic yet for this type of game\\", the sound effects as tremendous, and praised the inclusion of slow motion replays. Nintendo Power had similar thoughts on the sounds, and found that the \\"digitized voice of the scorekeeper and excellent sound effects added to the realism\\". N-Force praised the large and detailed sprites as well as the quality of animation. Rob Millichamp of N-Force described the perspective as \\"innovative and awesome\\", but it was a point of contention between critics. Mega felt the viewpoint made play confusing and difficult, while Super Play felt it made seeing where the ball was being served tricky. Both described it as the biggest detriment to the game. A concern shared by many of the critics, was the difficulty in controlling the player on the far side of the court. Due to the viewpoint and perspective of the game, the far side player sprite is significantly smaller compared to the near side player. N-Force felt this made hitting the ball a nightmare, and Super Play stated that \\"serving and receiving from that end is far too tricky.\\" Despite the criticism, reviews generally found the game enjoyable. Ed Semrad of EGM suggested that the game was \\"easily one of the best\\" tennis games, and N-Force called it \\"an amazing leap forward in tennis sims\\". Super Play concluded that although polished and enjoyable, it was not as good as Super Tennis, a previously released tennis game.

The painting currently resides at the Salvador Dal√≠ Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. This work is on loan from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. A Reynolds Morse.http://www.salvadordalimuseum.org/collection/collection_highlights.html Description This work of surrealistic art showcases a geometric figure with a tumescent red hand protruding from its head. The figure is composed of cones and triangles. Surrounding the structure are ghostly images of nude female figures and torsos superimposed on a blue, watery dreamscape. This piece was done upon Dal√≠'s return from 9 months of military duty. It was during his military career that Dal√≠ began experimenting with new subjects for his work. The Apparatus in the title refers to the geometric figure which is structured much like the human form. The figure has analogues of human arms, legs, an eye, and a head. The triangular being is propped up on what appears to be a cane, which was a leitmotif in Dal√≠'s work representing the fragility of sleep. The hand atop the figure's head is a reference to Onanism, which was a common theme in his work at the time. This period of Dal√≠'s career is referred to as the Freudian Period. This was during the Avant-Garde movement which was heavily weighted on the writings of Freud. The female images surrounding the geometric figure are representative of thoughts within the mind of the Apparatus. These images represent the delirious erotic thought processes of the artist, which was also a prevailing theme of his work.Moorhouse, Paul. Dal√≠, PRC Publishing, 1990 To the left of the geometric man is an image of a donkey on its hind legs. The donkey is being consumed by a horde of flies which are attacking its belly. This is indicative of the decomposition of the creature.

In that role, Rabbi Gottschalk oversaw the ordination of the first women to be ordained as rabbis in the United States and Israel, and he oversaw the development of new HUC campuses in Jerusalem, Los Angeles and New York City, three of the school's four campuses. Early life and education Gottschalk was born in Oberwesel, Germany on March 7, 1930, the only son of Max and Erna (Trum) Gottschalk. He was born to a family that had lived in the Rhineland for four centuries. As a child in 1937, he was admonished by his mother for leaving the house to watch Adolf Hitler pass by in a motorcade, telling him that: \\"A Jew risks a lot doing that\\". He would lose dozens of family members in The Holocaust, and maintained a commitment to the preservation of the Jewish religion and identity exemplified by his grandfather's having given him shreds of a Torah scroll the day after the November 1938 Kristallnacht that had been desecrated and thrown into a river during the anti-Jewish pogrom and telling Gottschalk that \\"one day we will put them together again\\". His father escaped Nazi Germany for New York City in 1938.Martin, Douglas. \\"Alfred Gottschalk, 79, Scholar of Reform Judaism, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, September 15, 2009. Accessed September 16, 2009. As a nine-year-old, Gottschalk was forced out of his classroom by a Nazi shouting: \\"Jews, raus! [out], raus! RAUS!\\", an incident that his successor as President of HUC, Rabbi David Ellenson described as being the impetus behind Gottschalk's \\"life's work on behalf of the Jewish people and humanity\\" and as one that Gottschalk would recall with \\"sadness, humiliation, and fury\\" 50 years later. After his expulsion from school, he recalled being beaten on Good Friday by a group of Catholic boys for the death of Werner, a Catholic boy who was said to have been killed by Jews on Maundy Thursday in the 13th century. He returned to visit his hometown of Oberwesel in September 2006, more than 60 years after he had left it, the only Jewish survivor of that town's small Jewish community. He and his mother managed to leave Germany for the United States to join his father in 1939. His family settled in Brooklyn, where he learned English while watching films he had paid for with money he had earned shining shoes. He \\"once thanked Ronald Reagan for teaching [him] English\\", having seen the President in many of the films he saw as a child new to the United States.

After his father died, Gottschalk helped support the family by playing semi professional football. He earned his undergraduate degree at Brooklyn College and then attended Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, from which he received his rabbinic ordination in 1957, simultaneously earning a master's in Hebrew literature. In 1965, he earned his Ph.D. in Bible and Jewish thought from University of Southern California with a dissertation on Ahad Ha'am, the pen name of pre-state Zionist thinker and essayist Asher Zvi Hirsch Ginsberg.

He embraced both fascism and Pan-Germanism without fully committing to Nazism. Military career A career soldier, Hiltl attended the military academy at Wiener Neustadt before being commissioned to Infantry Regiment No. 33. He also served as a tutor at Vienna Infantry Cadet School.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 184 He served for the entirety of the First World War, initially in Serbia, then Italy, before a return to Serbia and finally South Tyrol where he was captured and spent time in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp. By the end of the war Hiltl had risen to the rank of colonel.R.J.B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 441 Frontk√§mpfervereinigung After his release he formed his own 'Battalion Hiltl' as a force against growing radicalism in Austria and he soon reorganised this group as the Bund f√ºr Ordnung und Wirtschaftsschutz. This latter group soon gave way to the Frontk√§mpfervereinigung, an organisation that served a similar purpose to the Der Stahlhelm in Germany i.e. a rallying point for militant nationalist rightists opposed to the growth of socialism and communism. This group however called for a unification of the German volk and blamed the Jews on preventing this unity. Hiltl was personally noted for his anti-Semitism and when speaking to a March 1921 conference of the Antisemitenbund he called for Jews in Austria to be stripped of their citizenship, blaming them for the collapse of the Habsburg Empire.David Cesarani, Eichmann: His Life and Crimes, Vintage Books, 2005, p. 28 In 1927 the Frontk√§mpfervereinigung was involved in a confrontation with the Republikanischer Schutzbund in Schattendorf, Burgenland, on 30 January. When the Frontk√§mpfervereinigung activists were found not guilty by a jury, the socialists organised a general strike, which led to the July Revolt of 1927. Following this, the previously shared leadership was done away with and Hiltl became sole leader of the movement in September 1927. By this time, he had become a supporter of Italian fascism and under his leadership the Frontk√§mpfervereinigung abandoned any pretensions of being pan-nationalist and instead embraced fascism fully. The group operated alongside the Heimwehr, although it had a sometimes troublesome relationship with that movement, due to Hiltl's support for union with Germany. The group also had a youth wing, the Jungfrontk√§mpfervereinigung, of which a youthful Adolf Eichmann was a member. Relationship with Nazism Hiltl's support for union with Germany brought him into contact with the Nazi Party, although he was never a member as he hated party politics. Nonetheless a number of leading Nazis, including Alfred Frauenfeld, passed through his movement and he was guest of honour at the Nazi Party conference in 1929. It became a moot point with his death in 1930, although most of the Frontk√§mpfervereinigung ended up being absorbed by Austria's Nazis.  References  * Eugen von Hammer (Ed.): Oberst Hiltl.

In a network solid there are no individual molecules, and the entire crystal or amorphous solid may be considered a macromolecule. Formulas for network solids, like those for ionic compounds, are simple ratios of the component atoms represented by a formula unit. Examples of network solids include diamond with a continuous network of carbon atoms and silicon dioxide or quartz with a continuous three-dimensional network of SiO2 units. Graphite and the mica group of silicate minerals structurally consist of continuous two-dimensional sheets covalently bonded within the layer, with other bond types holding the layers together. Disordered network solids are termed glasses. These are typically formed on rapid cooling of melts so that little time is left for atomic ordering to occur. Zarzycki, J. Glasses and the vitreous state, Cambridge University Press, New York, 1982.  Properties  * Hardness: Very hard, due to the strong covalent bonds throughout the lattice (deformation can be easier, however, in directions that do not require the breaking of any covalent bonds, as with flexing or sliding of sheets in graphite or mica). * Melting point: High, since melting means breaking covalent bonds (rather than merely overcoming weaker intermolecular forces). Ebbing, Darrell D., and R.A.D. Wentworth. Introductory Chemistry. 2nd ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1998.

However, network solids with delocalized pi bonds (e.g. graphite) or dopants can exhibit metal-like conductivity. * Liquid-phase electrical conductivity: Low, as the macromolecule consists of neutral atoms, meaning that melting does not free up any new charge carriers (as it would for an ionic compound). * Solubility: Generally insoluble in any solvent due to the difficulty of solvating such a very large molecule.

From . PARP inhibitors are a group of pharmacological inhibitors of the enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). They are developed for multiple indications, including the treatment of heritable cancers. Several forms of cancer are more dependent on PARP than regular cells, making PARP (PARP1, PARP2 etc) an attractive target for cancer therapy. PARP inhibitors appear to improve progression-free survival in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, as evidenced mainly by olaparib added to conventional treatment. In addition to their use in cancer therapy, PARP inhibitors are considered a potential treatment for acute life-threatening diseases, such as stroke and myocardial infarction, as well as for long-term neurodegenerative diseases. Mechanism of action DNA is damaged thousands of times during each cell cycle, and that damage must be repaired, including in cancer cells. Otherwise the cells may die due to this damage. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy attempt to kill cancer cells by inducing high levels of DNA damage. By inhibiting PARP1 DNA repair, the effectiveness of these therapies can be increased. BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 are proteins that are important for the repair of double-strand DNA breaks by the error-free homologous recombinational repair, or HRR, pathway. When the gene for one of these proteins is mutated, the change can lead to errors in DNA repair that can eventually cause breast cancer. When subjected to enough damage at one time, the altered gene can cause the death of the cells. PARP1 is a protein that is important for repairing single-strand breaks ('nicks' in the DNA). If such nicks persist unrepaired until DNA is replicated (which must precede cell division), then the replication itself can cause double strand breaks to form.McGlynn, P. and Lloyd, B. \\"Recombinational Repair and Restart of Damaged Replication Forks.\\" Nature Reviews, 2002, pp.859-870 Drugs that inhibit PARP1 cause multiple double strand breaks to form in this way, and in tumours with BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 mutations, these double strand breaks cannot be efficiently repaired, leading to the death of the cells. Normal cells that don't replicate their DNA as often as cancer cells, and that lack any mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 still have homologous repair operating, which allows them to survive the inhibition of PARP. PARP inhibitors lead to trapping of PARP proteins on DNA in addition to blocking their catalytic action. This interferes with replication, causing cell death preferentially in cancer cells, which grow faster than non-cancerous cells. Some cancer cells that lack the tumor suppressor PTEN may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors because of downregulation of Rad51, a critical homologous recombination component, although other data suggest PTEN may not regulate Rad51. Hence PARP inhibitors may be effective against many PTEN-defective tumours (e.g. some aggressive prostate cancers). Cancer cells that are low in oxygen (e.g. in fast growing tumors) are sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Excessive PARP-1 activity may exacerbate the pathogenesis of stroke, myocardial infarction, neurodegeneration, and a number of other disease conditions due to excessive inflammation. Thus, reduction of inflammation by PARP-1 inhibition can mitigate these conditions.

Experimental: *3-Aminobenzamide, a prototypical PARP inhibitor. Combination with radiotherapy The main function of radiotherapy is to produce DNA strand breaks, causing severe DNA damage and leading to cell death. Radiotherapy has the potential to kill 100% of any targeted cells, but the dose required to do so would cause unacceptable side effects to healthy tissue. Radiotherapy therefore can only be given up to a certain level of radiation exposure. Combining radiation therapy with PARP inhibitors offers promise, since the inhibitors would lead to formation of double strand breaks from the single- strand breaks generated by the radiotherapy in tumor tissue with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. This combination could therefore lead to either more powerful therapy with the same radiation dose or similarly powerful therapy with a lower radiation dose.

It was incorporated in 1971 by Jay and Cheryl Bowman. In 1973, it became the state affiliate of the Washington, D.C. based National Right to Life Committee in response to the Supreme decision of Roe v. Wade which legalized abortion. GRTL serves as Georgia's largest pro-life organization with grassroots chapters across more than 30 counties in Georgia and more than 240,000 identified pro-life households. Georgia Right to Life is organized for activities in the areas of education, legislation, and political action. The organization uses the aforementioned methods to oppose legalized abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, human cloning and artificially produced genetic transformation. History Georgia Right to Life, which was originally titled the Georgia Right to Life Committee, was established in 1970. The organization changed its name to Georgia Right to Life in the mid-1980s. Its first major action was a letter-writing campaign in the same year. The campaign encouraged Georgians to vote for pro-life candidates. By 1971, the Georgia Right to Life Committee was incorporated and became a member of the National Right to Life Coalition. An office was set up in the garage of the Bowman's home and volunteers helped mail packets of information and a newsletter to thousands of Georgians. Several months later, Georgia Right to Life began establishing local chapters in other parts of the state. In 1973, Georgia Right to Life launched a pro- life campaign in reaction to the Supreme Court case Roe v Wade which was decided on January 22, 1973. The Bowmans appeared on television and radio programs as speakers on abortion and other pro-life issues. Jay Bowman appeared in the \\"hot seat\\" on the WAGA show \\"Confrontation\\" and Cheryl Bowman appeared on WSB-TV's \\"Today in Georgia.\\" The group gained national recognition when an article about Georgia Right to Life was printed in a 1975 issue of \\"Newsweek\\". The organization eventually relocated its office to Decatur, Georgia. The Bowmans left Georgia Right to Life in the late 1970s. Mary Boyert joined GRTL's executive committee in 1978. She served as the Education Director from 1979-1980. She was elected president of the organization in 1980. She served for three consecutive terms (1980‚Äì1986). After her third and final term, Boyert was appointed to the Executive Director position in late 1986. She held that post until being appointed the Archdiocesan Pro-Life Director in 2000. Boyert established the Georgia Right to Life Executive Committee, the Georgia Right to Life Educational Trust Fund, and the Georgia Right to Life Political Action Committee. Under Ms. Boyert's presidency, local chapters were founded and the organization's bimonthly newsletter. By the 1990s, 225,000 pro-life households identified with the organization. Mary Boyert In 2000, president-elect Caryl Swift and the State Board of Directors voted to reverse the organization's position on politicians; views on abortion in regard to rape and incest. Previously to 1999, Georgia Right to Life did not disqualify elected public officials from receiving an endorsement from the organization if they held an exception for abortion in favor of rape and incest victims. Caryl Swift and the Executive Committee reversed this position. All politicians who hold an abortion exception for rape and incest can no longer qualify for an endorsement from the GRTL Political Action Committee. In 2015, Georgia Right to Life also eliminated the \\"life of the mother\\" exception as an allowable exception held by candidates seeking endorsement, understanding that in every situation both the life of the mother and the life of the pre-born baby deserve to be fought for and protected. In 2000, Caryl Swift was elected to the presidency of Georgia Right to Life. She held the position from 2000-2007. Under Ms. Swift, GRTL began lobbying for Georgia state representatives and proposed legislation. In the last few years, GRTL has publicly endorsed Casey Cagle, Ralph E. Reed Jr., Paul Broun, and Mac Collins for higher political office. Current United States Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) did not receive an endorsement from Georgia Right to Life in the 2004 midterm elections. The REACH Benefit Dinner was first established in 2001 by the Swift administration. REACH, which is an acronym for Reaching Hearts, Changing Minds, is an annual fundraiser for Georgia Right to Life's Educational Trust Fund. Under Ms. Swift's presidency, Georgia Right to Life was able to successfully lobby the General Assembly on HB 197 in 2006. The bill created a 24-hour waiting period for all women seeking an abortion, tightened parental notification regulations, mandated that all women seeking abortion be offered the chance to view an ultrasound, and mandated all women seeking abortion be informed about fetal pain. By unanimous vote by the state board, GRTL became a faith-based organization in 2007. Georgia Right to Life is a philanthropic Judeo-Christian organization which is legally recognized as a not-for-profit. Presidents Georgia Right to Life has had a democratically elected president since its creation in 1970. All presidents are limited to three consecutive terms. Any president may serve in any position within the organization after their presidency for as long as the current president sees fit. List of presidents: * 1970‚Äì1979: Jay Bowman * 1979‚Äì1980: Kel MacDonald * 1980‚Äì1986: Mary Boyert * 1986‚Äì1988: John and Linda Fuchko * 1988‚Äì1989: Erik Petersen * 1990‚Äì1991: Tom Clark * 1991‚Äì2000: Gen Wilson * 2000‚Äì2007: Caryl Swift * 2007‚Äì2016: Dan Becker * 2016‚ÄìPresent: Ricardo Davis Recent history Today, Georgia Right to Life's activities include: the printing of a bi-monthly newsletter with a stated circulation of around 60,000, the funding a multi-media pro-life and \\"personhood\\" campaign, the drafting and promoting of legislation to restrict abortion, and the hosting of pro-life events such as the annual Georgia March For Life Memorial Service and Silent March commemorating the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Georgia Right to Life is also well known for its pro-life organization (intended for instilling, mentoring, and fostering a respect for human life in young girls), Miss Right to Life of Georgia Scholarship and Benefit Pageant. There are currently 30 adult-organized, grass roots chapters and one youth-focused and youth-organized chapter (Mission: Life, see Mission: Life section) under the Georgia Right to Life banner. Daniel Becker succeeded Caryl Swift as president of Georgia Right to Life in 2007. Under Becker's leadership, the organization has lobbied for restrictions on abortion, including the Human Life Amendment which would have defined personhood as beginning at fertilization, to be added to the Georgia Constitution. Georgia Right to Life has been written about in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, the Christian Newswire, the Christian Index, and the Times Free Press as well as highlighted by NPR and other sources of media. As mentioned, each year, Georgia Right to Life hosts the Georgia March For Life Memorial Service and Silent March at Liberty Plaza, across from the Georgia State Capitol. Rep. Martin Scott (R-District 2) and Dr. Alveda King, the niece of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., spoke at the event in 2009. In most recent news, Georgia Right to Life has received coverage for its endorsement of Governor Mike Huckabee in the 2008 presidential election and its support for The Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act, the Option of Adoption Act (placing embryos in the adoption process), and HR 334/SR 156 \\"Opposing FOCA Resolution.\\" Georgia Right to Life has also received media coverage for its strong stand in favor of the Human Life Amendment. The organization has lobbied Georgia House Speaker Glenn Richardson for a speedy vote on the amendment To date, the Human Life Amendment has not come to a vote in the Georgia General Assembly. Other GRTL-sponsored legislation which has not received a hearing in the Georgia House include SB 223 \\"The Woman's Reproductive Health Oversight Committee,\\" HR 1 \\"Ban on Abortion,\\" and HR 5 \\"Paramount Right to Life Amendment.\\" The organization's most recent projects include the \\"Abortion Holocaust Memorial Wall\\" and the \\"Choose Life\\" license plates campaign. The virtual wall is modeled after the Vietnam Memorial but it recognizes every abortion performed in the United States since 1973. In 2009, GRTL joined the non-profit organization Choose Life of Georgia in its license plate campaign. License plates which read \\"Choose Life\\" are offered to be purchased by any Georgia citizen. Proceeds from the purchases are donated to agencies that promote adoption (pro-life pregnancy centers). In 2009, Georgia Right to Life released its Candidate Affirmation statement. Any political candidate who seeks an endorsement from the organization must sign the statement. The document reads: WHEREAS, the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, \\"‚Ä¶nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law,\\" Georgia Right to Life PAC affirms the principle that the right to life is the bedrock upon which all other constitutional rights are derived. IN ADDITION, we believe in the face of compelling biological evidence that a continuum of human life and personhood begins at the moment of fertilization and ends at natural death, the ethical treatment of human embryos must include their \\"best interests,\\" THEREFORE, as a candidate for public office, I affirm my support for a Human Life Amendment to the Georgia Constitution and other actions that would support these principles. This would assure that regardless of race, age, degree of disability, manner of conception or circumstances surrounding a terminal illness, the civil rights of the pre-born at an embryonic or fetal level, and the elderly and those with mental or physical infirmities are protected by law; and are violated when we allow destructive embryonic stem cell research, therapeutic or reproductive cloning, animal human hybrids, abortion (in the rare case that the mother's life is indeed endangered by a continuation of the pregnancy, sound medical practice would dictate that every effort be made to save both lives), infanticide, euthanasia or assisted suicide. Georgia state senator Eric Johnson, Ray McBerry, Georgia state Commissioner John Oxendine, Georgia state representative Austin Scott, and Jeff Chapman, five of the Republican candidates for Governor, have signed GRTL's declaration. In 2010, Georgia Right to Life promoted a pro-life outreach campaign geared toward the African-American community. In 2014, The National Right to Life Committee voted to replace Georgia Right to Life with the Georgia Life Alliance as its official NRLC affiliate for the state of Georgia.\\"National Right to Life Welcomes Georgia Life Alliance\\".

It was originally believed to act as an irreversible inhibitor of PARP1 (hence, a PARP inhibitor) and possibly other enzymes through covalent modification, but its effects against PARP were later disproven. It underwent clinical trials for treatment of some types of breast cancer, but was discontinued after disappointing phase III clinical trials. History Iniparib was the first putative PARP inhibitor to commence phase III clinical trials. The first was for breast cancer, 2009 to 2012, Primary completion date June 2011 another was for squamous-cell lung cancer. 2010 to 2014, PCD 2012 Preliminary results in June 2009 on triple-negative breast cancer were promising. Later results showed increased median survival of triple-negative breast cancer patients from 7.7 to 12.2 months. In 2009, the FDA began fast- tracking the new drug application of iniparib for triple-negative breast cancer. However, phase III results disclosed in January 2011 were disappointing. Iniparib was also studied as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the fight against malignant glioma, including glioblastoma. Glioma is a resilient type of primary brain tumor (not metastatic) that currently has limited effective therapies, especially for patients whose tumors are in an inoperable location of the brain, such as the interior of the brainstem. During the 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology conference, Sanofi disclosed that iniparib failed to help lung-cancer patients in a late-stage trial, prompting the company to end research into the once-promising compound and take a $285 million charge.

This Noble House from the 16th century was rebuilt by Alexander van Spaen (1619‚Äì1692) into the present day castle with four equal corner towers. History The castle almost certainly originated as a large farm that was first mentioned in 1076. Only in 1530 did Charles, Duke of Guelders built a castle out of it. The towers also date from this time. From the rest of the building it has not been confirmed what is original and what is not. The family Van Spaen rebuilt the castle around the 18th century into its current state. In 1795 French troops were quartered in the castle. After they left the castle was plundered and the interior largely destroyed. The damage was restored with amongst others ornamental plaster and ceiling paintings. Ownership The estate was originally called Broekerhof, and was a place where taxes were collected. In 1076 it was donated by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor to the Sint-Pieter Chapter in Utrecht. In 1530 it was sold to Charles, Duke of Guelders. He in turn had to sell it again in 1535 because of debts. It came into possession of Charles' general Roelof van Lennep. Roelof's son Carl, mayor of Arnhem, inherited it in 1546. His son Roelof inherited it in turn in 1567. After family divisions it was sold to the baronial family Van Spaen in 1661. In 1849 baron Van Hardenbroek allowed Anna Pavlovna of Russia to use it temporarily. In 1872 it was inherited by the family L√ºps, until 2008. On July 25, 2008 part of the inventory of the castle was sold at Christie's in Amsterdam.

Designed by Universal Creative, the first installation opened at Islands of Adventure on June 18, 2010. The new ride was a redesign of an existing roller coaster known as Flying Unicorn, which the park closed in 2008 to begin its transformation. The design change was implemented to fit the new Harry Potter-themed area that was being constructed at the park. Flight of the Hippogriff is a mild alternative to the area's more extreme rides such as Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. Following a successful launch, identical versions of the roller coaster were installed at Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Hollywood over the next several years. History Islands of Adventure Flying Unicorn was one of the first rides to be added to Islands of Adventure after its grand opening, debuting on June 29, 2000, in the park's Lost Continent area. The ride took place in an enchanted forest, like something from a fairy tale. Various signs along the queue tell the story of a wizard who found a baby unicorn's horn, which it shed (once every thousand years). He then used the horn to create this ride. The magic from the unicorn's horn is used so that it can fly. Guests rode in carts designed to look like mechanical unicorns and travel over a track to the top of the lift before dropping through various dips and turns and being deposited at the start of the track. Entrance to the attraction. Following the announcement of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter section in May 2007, both Flying Unicorn and fellow previous incarnation Dueling Dragons were shown to be in the new area, but it had not been confirmed whether they were to be closed and rethemed as of that time. After eight years of operation, Flying Unicorn closed on July 7, 2008, to allow construction to proceed on the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. On September 15, 2009, Universal officially revealed the attractions that would open in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter section, confirming that Flying Unicorn would be refurbished and rethemed into Flight of the Hippogriff. The attraction soft opened on June 1, 2010, under the new name of Flight of the Hippogriff. It officially opened with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter on June 18, 2010. Universal Studios Japan A duplicate of the Orlando attraction was installed at Universal Studios Japan as part of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed area. It opened on July 15, 2014. Universal Studios Hollywood Flight of the Hippogriff was also installed at Universal Studios Hollywood and opened on April 7, 2016. This is the first outdoor roller coaster at the Hollywood location. Attraction summary Track layout Queue The roller coaster's new backstory is that Hagrid is teaching young wizards how to fly a Hippogriff by using fake replicas of the creature. The queue line weaves through Hogwarts Grounds, past Hagrid's Hut and the Forest, and leads into an open canopy where Care of Magical Creatures Class is taught, and riders board the vehicle. Ride The roller coaster takes passengers on a test flight of the Hippogriff over the Forbidden Forest and Hagrid's Hut. Riders are instructed to bow to the Hippogriff before the ride progresses up the lift hill. The cars then travel over a track, to the top of the lift, where riders have a full aerial view of The Wizarding World, and then dropped through various dips and turns around Hogwarts Grounds before being deposited at the start of the track, where Hagrid thanks riders, who then disembark.

The book covers the culture for young men transitioning from adolescence to adulthood. Kimmel interviewed 400 men aged 16 to 26 and identified a trend whereby young men increasingly delay adulthood. Kimmel notes that, in 1960, almost 70% of American men had by the age of 30 left home, completed their educations, found a partner and started work. By comparison, today less than a third of men reach these milestones before their thirties. Kimmel writes that young men are reluctant to grow up because they \\"see grown-up life as such a loss\\". In order to avoid the responsibilities of adulthood, young men retreat into a homosocial world Kimmel terms \\"Guyland\\", a social space and a stage of life where \\"guys gather to be guys with each other, unhassled by the demands of parents, girlfriends, jobs, kids, and the other nuisances of adult life\\". Young white men, in particular, feel a sense of \\"thwarted entitlement\\", believing that women and minorities have taken away traditionally white male jobs and positions.

Career  Football career  Ayers played high school football in his hometown of Toccoa, Georgia and at Darlington high school in Rome, Georgia. He played halfback. Ayers earned All Mid Conference honors and went on the University of Georgia on a scholarship he had received where he also played football. While playing at Georgia, Ayers sustained a knee injury at practice that ended his football career. Ayers helped coach the Georgia B team after his injury and was also a student trainer in 1946 through 1947.  Coaching career  Howard Ayers first head coaching job was in Lavonia, Georgia. He compiled a record of twenty five wins, three losses, and two no contests. Ayers would go on to coach at Winder, Georgia before making his way to Cedartown in 1952. Ayers was a big hit in Cedartown, known for his motivational half time speeches and his ability to get his players fired up before games. In Ayers time in Cedartown, he would gather a record of ninety one wins, forty three losses, and five no contests. He would capture two region championships, seven sub region championships, and eventually a state championship in 1963. Ayers still holds the all-time record for most wins as a coach at Cedartown. The high school stadium would later be named ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Ayers Memorial Stadium in commemoration to him. In 1964, Ayers would become an assistant coach to Vince Dooley at the University of Georgia where he would coach for seventeen years. ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù coached the freshman team and was part of recruiting. While coaching the freshman team, Ayers compiled a record of twenty eight wins with twelve losses-- the best record in Georgia Football History.  Post coaching  Ayers is still very involved with the Cedartown football program. Once a week, he makes an appearance at the Bulldogs' practice and gives motivational speeches to the team he loved and coached for so many years. A charitable golf tournament named the Doc Ayers - Ray Beck golf tournament is held annually in Cedartown. Ayers co- hosted the tournament with Ray Beck at Cherokee Country Club. All the money from the tournament goes to the Polk County Community Foundation. Many former pro football and baseball players attend every year.  Accomplishments  Howard Ayers received many honors including Georgia State Class AAA Coach of the year and has been inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame.

His research centers around the interface between computational complexity theory and cryptography. He focuses on the topics of pseudorandomness and zero-knowledge proofs. His work on zig-zag product, with Omer Reingold and Avi Wigderson, was awarded the 2009 G√∂del Prize.2009 G√∂del Prize, European Association for Theoretical Computer Science.  Contributions   Zig-zag graph product for constructing expander graphs  One of the main contribution of his work is a new type of graph product, called the zig-zag product. Taking a product of a large graph with a small graph, the resulting graph inherits (roughly) its size from the large one, its degree from the small one, and its expansion properties from both. Iteration yields simple explicit constructions of constant-degree expanders of every size, starting from one constant-size expander. Crucial to the intuition and simple analysis of the properties of the zig-zag product is the view of expanders as functions which act as ‚Äúentropy wave‚Äù propagators ‚Äî they transform probability distributions in which entropy is concentrated in one area to distributions where that concentration is dissipated. In these terms, the graph product affords the constructive interference of two such waves. A variant of this product can be applied to extractors, giving the first explicit extractors whose seed length depends (poly)logarithmically on only the entropy deficiency of the source (rather than its length) and that extract almost all the entropy of high min-entropy sources. These high min-entropy extractors have several interesting applications, including the first constant-degree explicit expanders which beat the ‚Äúeigenvalue bound.‚Äù Vadhan also came up with another simplified approachRozenman-Vadhan. to the undirected ST-connectivity problem following Reingold's breakthrough result. Also the zig-zag product was useful in Omer Reingold's proof that SL=L.  Zero-knowledge proofs  His work in this area is to use complexity-theoretic methods to understand the power and limitations of zero-knowledge proofs. In a series of papers with Oded Goldreich and Amit Sahai, they gained thorough understanding of the class SZK of problems possessing statistical zero-knowledge proofs, characterized the class SZK and proved that SZK is closed under various operations. Recently his work was trying to work on the zero-knowledge proof beyond the confines of SZK class.  Randomness extractors  With Lu, Omer Reingold, and Avi Wigderson, he gave the first construction of randomness extractors that are ‚Äúoptimal up to constant factors,‚Äù reaching a milestone in a decade of work on the subject. With Trevisan, Zuckerman, Kamp, and Rao, he developed a theory of randomness extraction (and data compression) from samplable sources, which are random sources generated by an (unknown) efficient algorithm.

The other Renault driver, Fernando Alonso, had previously made an early pitstop, and was promoted to the race lead as other cars pitted under safety car conditions. Alonso subsequently won the race after starting 15th on the grid. Piquet described his crash at the time as a simple mistake. After being dropped by the Renault team following the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Piquet alleged that he had been asked by the team to deliberately crash to improve the race situation for Alonso, sparking an investigation of Renault F1 for race fixing by F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the Formula One governing body. After an investigation, Renault F1 were charged with conspiracy on 4 September, and were to answer the charge on 21 September 2009. On 16 September, Renault stated that they would not contest the charges, and announced that the team's managing director, Flavio Briatore, and its executive director of engineering, Pat Symonds, had left the team. On 21 September, it was announced that the Renault F1 team had been handed a disqualification from Formula One. The disqualification was suspended for two years pending any further comparable rule infringements. Briatore was banned from all Formula One events and FIA-sanctioned events indefinitely, whilst Symonds received a five-year ban. Their bans were subsequently overturned by a French court, although they both agreed not to work in Formula One or FIA- sanctioned events for a specified time as part of a later settlement reached with the governing body. Background Renault F1 Nelson Piquet Jr., December 2007 The Renault F1 Formula One team came into existence with the car manufacturer Renault's re-entrance into Formula One in 2000, by purchasing the Benetton Formula One team. Italian businessman Flavio Briatore had been managing director of Benetton until 1997, when he was replaced by Prodrive boss David Richards. After managing Renault's motorsport sister company Mecachrome, he returned to the main team following the Renault takeover, again as managing director. In addition to his Formula One sporting interests, as of August 2007, Briatore was Chairman and part owner of the English football club Queens Park Rangers F.C. (QPR), which he purchased jointly with Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone, being joined later by funds from Indian industrialist Lakshmi Mittal. Spanish racing driver Fernando Alonso had been involved in Formula One since 2001, and drove for the team from 2002 to 2006. After becoming World Champion in 2005 and 2006 and a one-year stint with McLaren, he returned to the team in 2008. English engineer Pat Symonds had risen to his position as Executive Director of Engineering with Renault F1 having worked for the Benetton team, and having entered Formula One with Benetton's predecessor Toleman Motosport in the early 1980s. Brazilian racing car driver Nelson Piquet Jr. ‚Äì son of the Formula One triple-world champion Nelson Piquet ‚Äì joined the Renault F1 team as the second car driver alongside Alonso for the 2008 season, having been their reserve and test driver during 2007. Since October 2006, Piquet Jr. was also personally contracted to Flavio Briatore's management company FFBB. Before the Singapore incident, Renault F1 had not won a race for almost two years (the last Grand Prix won was on 8 October 2006, the Japanese Grand Prix), and were said to be close to quitting the sport. 2008 Singapore Grand Prix Alonso on the podium of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, with Briatore far right (white shirt) The 2008 Singapore Grand Prix was the fifteenth race of the 2008 Formula One season, and took place on 28 September 2008. The race was Formula One's first night race. On the race weekend, despite Alonso being close to the top in practice, Renault had a poor qualifying session and started well down the grid, with Fernando Alonso starting in fifteenth place, and Nelson Piquet Jr. alongside him in 16th. Alonso was eliminated during qualifying because of mechanical failure. During the warm-up lap, Piquet spun at the exact corner where he would later crash out, but was in this instance able to continue. After the race started, Alonso was the first driver to make a routine pit stop for fuel and tyres on lap 12, rejoining the race at the back of the field. He had put in a light fuel load at the start of the race in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low positions tend to do the opposite and go for heavier fuel loads to make one fewer pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as they do not want to waste a light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles. Three laps later, Nelson Piquet Jr. hit the circuit wall at turn seventeen, one of the turns on the circuit which did not have a crane nearby, necessitating the deployment of the safety car. Brazilian Felipe Massa was leading the Grand Prix for Ferrari before Piquet Jr.'s crash Safety car regulations in 2008 meant that the pit lane was closed until all cars had been bunched up behind the safety car. Hence the advantage of the lead cars would be eliminated before they were able to pit and after they did pit, they would re-enter the race at the back of the field. Alonso, having pitted just before the safety car was introduced, therefore gained a significant advantage. (Under previous regulations, the pit lane remained open during safety car incidents and the lead cars could quickly pit before their lead was eliminated and re-enter the race with less loss of track position.) In order to avoid running out of fuel, some drivers did need to pit while the pit lane was closed and they were penalised for the infraction. Most of the leading cars ended up behind Alonso and also behind some slower drivers who proved difficult to pass on the narrow circuit; those ahead of Alonso were lighter on fuel and whilst they were able to pull away, they still needed to make a pit stop. After gaining the lead in the final third of the race, Alonso went on to win the race. No action was initially taken over the crash. Piquet Jr. initially characterised the crash as a simple mistake. In the post-race press release from Renault F1, the team described Alonso's performance as a \\"brilliant tactical drive\\", while both Briatore and Symonds attributed the safety car use as a case of good luck. Following the race, freelance Formula One journalist Joe Saward, writing on grandprix.com, stated that \\"some cynics\\" were questioning the incident, but dismissed it with the opinion that \\"one likes to believe that no team would ever be so desperate as to have a driver throw his car at a wall\\". According to the Brazilian television station Rede Globo, Brazilian driver Felipe Massa, who finished the Singapore race in 13th having been leading at the time of Piquet Jr.'s crash, and eventually lost the 2008 World Championship to Lewis Hamilton by one point, did question Briatore about the crash at the time, although FIA president Max Mosley stated the sport could take no action based on \\"speculation\\". Piquet Jr. leaves Renault Fernando Alonso ended the 2008 season fifth in the Drivers Championship with 61 points, while Nelson Piquet Jr. finished in twelfth place, with 19 points. Their collective total earned Renault F1 fourth place in the Constructors Championship. Despite rumours that he was set to leave the team, Renault re-signed Piquet Jr. on a one-year contract for the 2009 season, once again alongside Alonso. By the tenth race of the 2009 season, Piquet Jr. had failed to score any points whereas Alonso had managed 13 for the team. On 3 August 2009, Piquet confirmed that he had been dropped by Renault. The departure was acrimonious, with Piquet Jr. criticising his former Renault F1 team and Briatore. He was replaced by test driver Romain Grosjean for the remainder of the season. Piquet's accusations Initial reports and investigation On 30 August 2009, reports by the Brazilian television station Rede Globo stated that Nelson Piquet Jr. was ordered to crash during the Singapore race. Formula One's governing body, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), immediately announced it was investigating \\"alleged incidents at a previous F1 event\\". It was widely reported that the race in question was the Singapore 2008 race. Renault charged On 4 September, following the investigation by the FIA, Renault F1 were formally accused of interfering with the outcome of the 2008 Singapore race and conspiring with Piquet Jr. In a statement, the FIA stated that the charges against Renault F1 included \\"a breach of Article 151c of the International Sporting Code, that the team conspired with its driver, Nelson Piquet Jr, to cause a deliberate crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix with the aim of causing the deployment of the safety car to the advantage of its other driver, Fernando Alonso.\\" The team was called to a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 21 September, days before the 2009 running of the Singapore Grand Prix. After being charged, the Renault F1 team stated that they would be making no comments until the hearing. Leaked evidence On 10 September, Piquet Jr. made the second of two statements to the FIA. On the same day, a transcript of Piquet Jr's first statement to the FIA made at their Headquarters in Paris on 30 July was published by F1SA.com (the F1 Supporters Association). In response to questions over its authenticity, the FIA president Max Mosley stated \\"I haven't seen anything which I believe to be a forgery.\\" In the transcript, Piquet Jr. states that he was asked by Briatore and Symonds to crash his car at a specific corner. Alonso denied knowing of any plan to ask Piquet to crash, stating \\"I cannot imagine these things, these situations. It's something that never entered my mind.\\" Nelson Piquet Jr. questioned whether Alonso knew that a crash was planned, citing that in his place, he would have questioned Renault's \\"senseless\\" Alonso race strategy of starting with a low fuel load and making an early pit stop on the twelfth lap. During the course of the investigation and before the WMSC hearing, Alonso was absolved of any blame by the FIA. On 11 September, Max Mosley, the FIA president confirmed Piquet Jr. would face no action after making his two statements, even if the case was found in favour of Renault. Renault start legal action Briatore at the Chinese Grand Prix, 2008 On 11 September, the day after Piquet Jr.'s statement to the FIA was leaked, Renault F1 stated that it intended to take legal action against Nelson Piquet Jr and his father in both French and British courts, stating that \\"...today the ING Renault F1 Team and its managing director Flavio Briatore personally wish to state they have commenced criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Jr and Nelson Piquet Sr in France concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail the team into allowing Mr Piquet Jr to drive for the remainder of the 2009 season\\". In response to the legal action, Piquet Jr. stated \\"Because I am telling the truth I have nothing to fear, whether from the Renault team or Mr Briatore ‚Äì and while I am well aware of the power and influence of those being investigated, and the vast resources at their disposal, I will not be bullied again into making a decision I regret\\". On 14 September 2009, Pat Symonds was also reported to have been offered immunity from action if he provided the FIA with details of the alleged conspiracy. Symonds was reported to have told FIA investigators that the initial idea of a crash had come from Piquet Jr. On 15 September, The Times newspaper published extracts of Renault F1 radio conversations transmitted before and after the Singapore race between Renault F1 personnel including Piquet Jr., Alonso, Symonds and Briatore. Briatore and Symonds depart Renault On 16 September the Renault F1 team announced it would not be contesting the charges at the meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 21 September, and stated that both Briatore and Symonds had left the team. The FIA confirmed that 21 September meeting would still go ahead following the departure of Briatore and Symonds, with sanctions against Renault F1 still possible. The day after the Renault announcement, Renault confirmed Briatore had resigned from the team, while Briatore himself stated of his departure that \\"I was just trying to save the team\\", \\"It's my duty. That's the reason I've finished.\\" World Motorsports Council meeting The extraordinary meeting of the World Motorsports Council took place on 21 September 2009 in Paris. After a ninety-minute hearing, the council imposed a disqualification on Renault, suspended for two years. This meant that if a similar incident occurred before 2011, Renault would be banned from Formula One. Briatore was banned indefinitely from any FIA-sanctioned event, while Symonds received a five-year ban. Furthermore, Briatore was indefinitely banned from managing drivers when the FIA stated that superlicences would not be issued or renewed to any driver associated with him in the future. Alonso was cleared of wrongdoing; the FIA found no evidence that he or his mechanics knew anything about the scheme. The council came down hard on Briatore because he denied his involvement despite overwhelming evidence. Symonds, in contrast, had confessed, expressing his \\"eternal regret and shame\\" for his role in the scheme. In announcing the sanctions, the council stated that Renault's actions were serious enough to merit being thrown out of Formula One altogether. However, it opted to impose a suspended sentence because Renault took swift action in forcing Briatore and Symonds to resign. The Daily Mirror described the de facto lifetime ban on Briatore as the harshest sanction ever imposed on an individual in the history of motorsport. A major contribution to the punishment of Briatore and Symonds was the testimony of an unnamed \\"Witness X\\", a Renault employee who was also present at the pre-race meeting but rejected the idea. Reaction After Renault F1 were formally charged, the alleged offence was thought to be unprecedented within Formula One. The scandal followed two recent Formula One cheating scandals: a case of industrial espionage between teams (including Renault F1); and an instance of the 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton being found to have lied to race stewards in March 2009. The scandal interrupted the team's parent company Renault S.A.'s launch of four electric vehicles at the Frankfurt Motor Show after journalists questioned Renault chief executive Carlos Ghosn over the affair, who directed all inquiries to Bernard Rey, chairman of Renault F1. On 17 September, Patrick Pelata, Renault S.A.'s chief operating officer, first representative from Renault to officially comment on the Singapore crash affair, stated that \\"The [Renault F1] team believes that a mistake has been made, and punishment must follow. Flavio Briatore considered himself to be morally responsible and resigned\\" and that the team would defer making a decision on the future options for the team. Pelata added that he did not wish the actions of Briatore and Symonds to \\"reflect upon the whole company and the entire Formula 1 team\\". In addition, Ghosn also called for calm and for Renault to \\"not react in the heat of the moment\\" while the Renault F1 team collaborated with the authorities, adding that \\"I am confident when the facts are established, we can take a very clear decision\\". Former Jordan Grand Prix F1 team principal Eddie Jordan believed that the departure of Briatore and Symonds from Renault on 16 September was an effective admission of guilt. Former three-time Formula One World Champion and former team owner Sir Jackie Stewart said of the Singapore scandal that \\"There is something fundamentally rotten and wrong at the heart of Formula One. Never in my experience has Formula One been in such a mood of self-destruction. Millions of fans are amazed, if not disgusted, at a sport which now goes from crisis to crisis with everyone blaming everyone else.\\" Former three-time Formula One World Champion and former Jaguar Racing team manager Niki Lauda, while comparing the Singapore incident to the 2007 espionage scandal, declared that \\"This [the Singapore crash incident], though, is new. The biggest damage ever. Now the FIA must punish Renault heavily to restore credibility in the sport.\\" Former 1996 F1 World Champion Damon Hill described the Singapore crash as \\"not a very good episode\\" for the sport and said of the future of F1 that \\"I'm concerned the sport is going to suffer as a genuine challenge, which is what I always felt it should be and would like it to be, of skill and competitiveness\\". Former racing driver Eddie Irvine, who retired from Formula One at the end of 2002, believed that the response to the Singapore incident had been an overreaction, stating that \\"This [Singapore incident] is probably slightly on the wrong side of the cheating thing but in days past every team have done whatever they could to win ‚Äì cheat, bend the rules, break the rules, sabotage opponents\\", \\"[t]his is just the FIA going on a crusade\\". He also speculated that the FIA would be lenient on Renault F1 and not expel them, due to the sport's current \\"shaky\\" condition after recent team departures. Chief Sportswriter Simon Barnes of British newspaper The Times sparked debate over the incident when he labelled it \\"the worst single piece of cheating in the history of sport\\" primarily because of its \\"potentially lethal consequences\\" to Piquet, the other drivers, marshals and spectators. Supporting Barnes, The Times' motor racing correspondent Edward Gorman cited the alleged top level pre-conceived elements of conspiracy that sought to sacrifice one team member to benefit another to put the incident on a par with controversies such as Ben Johnson, horse doping and illegal keels used in the America's Cup. Gorman then postulated that this incident was worse than those because Briatore and Symonds set in motion \\"an event of violent destruction, the consequences of which they could neither predict nor control.\\" Matthew Syed countered that while the incident was premeditated, \\"unspeakably unethical\\" and dangerous, it was not nearly as reckless as the East German athletics doping scandal and other instances of long-term doping. Syed also argued that the Renault team would not have been expecting injuries to result from the crash, in contrast to incidents such as the assault on ice skater Nancy Kerrigan. Responding to Flavio Briatore's resignation from Renault F1, Formula One Management's Bernie Ecclestone stated that \\"It is a pity that Flavio has ended his Formula One career in this way\\", \\"You can't defend him at all. What he did was completely unnecessary. It's a pity that it's happened\\", although Ecclestone denied that the scandal would 'finish' the sport, citing the sport's recovery from the death of Ayrton Senna and the (first) retirement of seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher. Main sponsors leave Renault F1 Renault equipment on the pitwall at the 2009 Japanese Grand Prix with ING logos covered after the company ended their sponsorship. In response to the scandal Renault's main sponsors ING and Mutua Madrile√±a ended their sponsorship agreements with Renault early, within a week after the FIA's decision and right before the next race, the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix, with the team removing their logos from the cars before the event. Major sponsor Mutua Madrile√±a withdrew its sponsorship of the Renault F1 team first, just before the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix weekend, believing that the situation \\"could affect the image, reputation and good name of the team's sponsors.\\" Mutua Madrile√±a did not withdraw sponsorship of Renault driver Fernando Alonso, as he was not implicated in the scandal. This was followed hours later by the withdrawal of title sponsor ING Group with immediate effect, who had been previously due to end their sponsorship of the team at the end of 2009. Flavio Briatore's response On 19 October 2009, Flavio Briatore announced his intentions to sue the FIA for his lifetime ban, claiming that \\"the FIA [had] been used as a tool of vengeance on behalf of one man\\" and that there were several miscarriages of justice, including a delay in summons, a failure to state the charges in advance and a lack of access to documents and \\"Witness X\\". On 5 January 2010, the French Tribunal de Grande Instance overturned his ban, and awarded him ‚Ç¨15,000 in compensation. Symonds' ban was also overturned, and he was awarded ‚Ç¨5,000 in compensation. Briatore was believed to be suing the FIA for damages in addition to getting his ban overturned, and has also stated his intention to pursue legal action against the Piquet family. FIA appeal On 11 January 2010, the FIA announced that they would appeal the decision of the Tribunal de Grande Instance to overturn the bans imposed on Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds. The FIA reinstated the bans while the appeal was active, but stated that drivers managed by Briatore would be granted their superlicences for 2010. On 12 April, the FIA announced a settlement with Briatore and Symonds, and that the legal action had been ended. Both men agreed not to work in Formula One until 2013, nor any other FIA-sanctioned championship until the end of 2011. Libel case against Renault On 7 December 2010 it was announced that Nelson Piquet Jr and his father had won a libel case against Renault at the High Court based on the allegations described above. Renault apologised to the Piquets and paid them substantial damages. Admitting they libelled the duo, a Renault statement read: \\"The team accepts, as it did before the World Motor Sport Council, that the allegations made by Nelson Piquet Junior were not false. As a result, these serious allegations contained in our press release were wholly untrue and unfounded, and we withdraw them unequivocally. We would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Piquet Junior and his father for the distress and embarrassment caused as a result. As a mark of the sincerity of our apology and regret, we have agreed to pay them a substantial amount of damages for libel as well as their costs, and have undertaken not to repeat these allegations at any time in the future. It also accepts that Mr Piquet Junior and his father did not invent these allegations to blackmail the team into allowing him to drive for them for the remainder of the 2009 season.\\" Potential consequences and aftermath It was suggested in the media that if Briatore were personally found guilty of race-fixing, he might fail the English Football League's fit-and-proper-person test which applies to football club owners and directors, whose regulations exclude people who are \\"subject to a ban from a sports governing body relating to the administration of their sport\\", though a BBC report opined that his position might be secure given that he had left Renault. The Football League stated that they would wait for the conclusion of the investigation before examining Briatore's fitness to continue to be a director of Queens Park Rangers F.C.. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further. Briatore stepped down from the club in February 2010 as a result. In addition to any sporting sanctions by the FIA, Renault, Piquet Jr. or even Felipe Massa could take legal action over the incident. It was speculated by the media that Briatore and Symonds could be extradited to Singapore to face criminal charges relating to the incident, which according to one lawyer could encompass \\"causing malicious or willful damage to property, endangering a vehicle and criminal conspiracy to commit a serious crime\\". This was thought to be unlikely however, with the Singaporean authorities believed to be unwilling to attract the negative publicity charges it would create, and also complicated by the fact that Singapore has an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (Symonds being a British citizen) but not Italy as Briatore is an Italian citizen. Piquet Jr. was criticized by many in the community and some suggest that the controversy effectively ended his hopes of continuing in F1. BBC F1 commentator Martin Brundle suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor would want to be associated with the Piquet family. Brundle noted that Piquet Jr. \\"didn't deliver at Renault, he wasn't fast enough, that's why he was released and that's why he has dropped hand grenades into the system ever since\\". Brundle was also highly critical that Piquet Jr. escaped sanction from the FIA despite admitting to race-fixing, while the others involved were heavily punished. Other leading F1 figures have echoed Brundle's sentiments. Toyota team principal John Howett was quoted as saying, \\"I think on his performance...disregarding the issue, I probably would not give him a drive and I would probably be further influenced in that decision by what took place.\\" Christian Horner, team principal of Red Bull Racing, has added, \\"I don't think we would have any interest [in Piquet Jr.] at Red Bull Racing.\\" Piquet Jr. has since joined America's NASCAR circuit, starting in the Camping World Truck Series and Nationwide Series in 2010. He drove for Turner Scott Motorsports part-time in the #30 Chevrolet Silverado in the Camping World Truck Series and full-time in the #30 Chevrolet Camaro in the Nationwide Series. In 2014‚Äì2015, Piquet Jr. took part in the inaugural Formula E season with China Racing, eventually becoming Formula E's inaugural champion by a single point over S√©bastien Buemi. Despite the controversy Alonso's career is said to have been untarnished, despite being the main person who benefited from the crash. Following the accident he raced with Ferrari (2010-2014) and McLaren (2015-2018). He is scheduled to race for Alpine in 2021 and 2022. From 2011 to 2013, Symonds returned to F1 as a consultant for the Virgin Racing. He would then serve as the chief technical officer at Williams from 2013 to 2016. Since March 2017 Symonds has been employed as Formula One's Chief Technical officer. As of September 2020, Flavio Briatore has never returned to Formula 1.  Legacy  In a 2018 retrospective article the BBC noted that nothing changed as a result of the scandal and nobody in the sport wants to talk about it.

Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are used to track movements of (usually large, migratory) marine animals. A PSAT (also commonly referred to as a PAT tag) is an archival tag (or data logger) that is equipped with a means to transmit the collected data via the Argos satellite system. Though the data are physically stored on the tag, its major advantage is that it does not have to be physically retrieved like an archival tag for the data to be available making it a viable, fishery independent tool for animal behavior and migration studies. They have been used to track movements of ocean sunfish, marlin, blue sharks, bluefin tuna, swordfish and sea turtles to name a few species. Location, depth, temperature, oxygen levels, and body movement data are used to answer questions about migratory patterns, seasonal feeding movements, daily habits, and survival after catch and release, for examples.Some examples include: Block, B, Dewar, H, Farwell, C, Prince, ED.

Marine Biology (2005) 148: 159‚Äì165 DOI 10.1007/s00227-005-0061-y A satellite tag is generally constructed of several components: a data-logging section, a release section, a float, and an antenna. The release sections include an energetically popped off release section or a corrosive pin that is actively corroded on a preset date or after a specified period of time. Some limitations of using satellite tags are their depth limitations (2000m), their costs ($499‚Äì$4000+), their vulnerability to loss by environmental issues (biofouling), or premature release through ingestion by a predator. There are two methods of underwater geolocation that PSATs employ. The first method is through light based geolocation which uses the length of the day and a noon time calculation to estimate the tags location while underwater. This method has a functional depth limitation of light penetration which can be as shallow as a few meters to upwards of hundreds of meters. Geolocation estimates based on light are usually coupled with additional satellite data like sea surface temperature or other available data input such as bathymetry, land avoidance, and physical limitations of the tagged animal. The other method available is through measuring ambient light and the Earth's magnetic field. This method has a functional depth limitation equivalent of the maximum depth limitation, generally 1800m. Magnetic based geolocation is generally not coupled with additional satellite data or other inputs, and relies on the Earth magnetic field for latitude estimations and light (noon time) for longitude estimations. General information PSATs are usually used on large marine animals and have been used in several studies of the bluefin tuna. Deployment of a PSAT on a bluefin tuna. Pop-up satellite tags range in length from about and weigh 36-108 grams in air. A tag must be small compared to the size of the animal, anywhere from 3-5% of the total fish weight, so that it does not interfere with normal behavior. These tags record information such as temperature, magnetics, acceleration, light level, oxygen levels and pressure at set intervals of a few seconds to several hours.Block, Ba, Dewar, H, Farwell, C, Prince, ED. A new satellite technology for tracking the movements of Atlantic bluefin tuna. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 95, pp. 9384‚Äì9389, August 1998; Nielson, A, Bigelow, KA, Musyl, MK, Sibert, JR. Improving light-based geolocation by including sea surface temperature. Fish. Oceanogr. 15:4, 314‚Äì325, 2006. Data are often collected for several weeks or months, but with new advances in memory technology microSD cards tags can store data for centuries. PSATs record data in non-volatile memory so that data are retained even if the power source fails. When the PSAT releases from the animal on which it was attached, it floats to the surface, and begins to transmit data to the Argos satellites at a frequency of 401.65 MHz +/-. Therefore, the tag does not have to be physically recovered for the data to be obtained. Summarized data illustrating where the fish's migration started and ended is usually recovered from the tag within about seven days; however, tags can transmit significant amounts of oceanic data for months after they release from the fish. Limitations of PSAT technology are that it is subject to loss by malfunction of the power source, environmental effects such as biofouling, ingestion by a predator, its depth limitation and cost. Most PSATS have internal software designed to detect damaging or sub-optimal conditions that will trigger an early release and transmission of data. For example, PSATs can withstand pressures to depths of depending on the model. If data indicate no change in pressure (depth) for a period of time, this could trigger an early release due to premature release (a tag pulling out of the fish early) or death of the animal to which it was attached. Such internal checks can alert researchers to unexpected or undesirable events. Ingestion by a predator is more difficult to detect in the sense of forcing a tag to report; however, in data processing it is indicated by an immediate loss of light and an increase in temperature that stabilizes while it is inside the predator.Kerstetter, DW, Polovina, JJ, Graves JE. Evidence of shark predation and scavenging on fishes equipped with pop-up satellite archival tags. Fish. Bull. 102:750‚Äì756 (2004). Types Using light level The most popular method of determining an animal's location underwater requires the tag to acquire light levels throughout the day. Observing the length of the day, from when the tag observed the first light until the last light, the tag can determine its latitudinal location (with accuracy exceeding 1 degree). From the length of day the tag computes the noon time which is converted to a longitude location (with accuracy averaging about 0.5 degree or 30‚Äì50 nautical miles). This method of geolocation is suitable for animals that inhabit clear waters near the surface. At depths or in turbid waters, light based geolocation does not work as well due to light attenuation. It also does not work well during the equinoxes when the length of day is globally uniform. Manufacturers of this technology include Wildlife Computers, Microwave Telemetry, and Lotek Wireless. Star-Oddi is in the development phase of a pop-up satellite tag as well. Using Earth‚Äôs magnetic field and light level Another approach to geolocation couples light and magnetics. This method measures the total Earth's magnetic field for latitude estimations while using light based noon time detection for longitude. These tags measure the Earth's magnetic field on their built-in magnetometers throughout the day and then take the average value as the tag's daily location. Average accuracy of this method is approximately 35 nautical miles. Manufacturers of this technology include Desert Star Systems.

Fossils have been found from the Wasatch Beds of the Willwood Formation of Wyoming, deposited during the early Eocene. The type species is O. olseni. The holotype, known as AMNH 5178, is the only known specimen belonging to the genus and consists of a skull lacking the lower jaws. The braincase is filled in by the matrix and most of the suture lines between bones are indiscernible, making comparisons with other eusuchian material difficult. Phylogeny Orthogenysuchus was first named in 1924 by Charles C. Mook and was referred to as a eusuchian, although not to any particular eusuchian group known at the time. Later publications assigned the genus to the Crocodylidae, but more recent analyses propose that it is a pristichampsid or even a synonym of Pristichampsus. In 1999, Orthogenysuchus was placed within a new clade containing the Miocene caimanines Purussaurus and Mourasuchus. Orthogenysuchus antedates these genera by around 30 million years, suggesting that they both had significant ghost lineages. Furthermore, the 1999 study proposed a clade containing only Orthogenysuchus and Mourasuchus. This clade is similar to the family Nettosuchidae, which was originally constructed in 1965 for Mourasuchus and the newly described Nettosuchus (later shown to be a junior synonym of the genus). However, the clade is based primarily on ambiguous characters as a result of the poor preservation of the holotype of Orthogenysuchus, thus has not yet been formally described. All unambiguous synapomorphies are based on the nasal region of the skull where the individual bones are easily distinguished. Orthogenysuchus shares with Mourasuchus a characteristically long, broad snout, extremely wide external nares consisting of the nasal aperture and dorsal fossa, and many small maxillary alveoli. Paleobiology Orthogenysuchus is representative of the diverse Wasatchian faunas that occurred during the early Eocene in North America. These faunas are also characterized by the appearance or diversification of many chelonians such as emydids and testudinids, as well as the occurrence of rhineurid amphisbaenians. This followed a major faunal turnover at the Clarkforkian- Wasatchian boundary which resulted in the regional disappearance of champsosaurs and the extinction of the alligatorine Ceratosuchus. The presence of Orthogenys in North America during the Eocene suggests that a dispersal event occurred of caimans into the continent from South America after the original spread of early alligatorines and caimanines into South America that occurred during the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary).

The new style is revealed to be Maddox's attempt at self-improvement in preparation for his Politics Minute appearance. A tip is revealed on the wires that Sir Elton John has reportedly assaulted a security guard in Argos branch in Wolverhampton. Tasneem worries as she tells Oliver that the edible mushroom wall chart provided with a previous edition contains a very poisonous mushroom. An investigation is also started into a reported nuclear leak at a power station which is being hushed-up. Oliver calls on Maddox to pay-off a woman who has been poisoned by the mushroom by handing over an envelope with ¬£25,000. At lunch, Amelia tries to persuade Oliver to cover up the nuclear leak story as her mother has shares in the parent company. Maddox returns from paying off the poisoned woman who settles for ¬£5,000 and is upset that the nuclear story has been spiked. He reveals he donated the remaining ¬£20,000 to Greenpeace. The assault story is almost published, except Maddox finds that the Elton John was a tribute act. Maddox's Politics Minute receives a large number of hits due to his Donald Trump-like appearance. Episode 3 Freddy believes he has an exclusive but his source is a website; politicaltart.com which frequently posts ridiculous stories much to Maddox's ire. Freddy believes that the wife of the first finance secretary is shipping gold bullion out of the country in anticipation of a banking crisis. Oliver is again not interested in a story that Maddox has written on healthy food, and instead wants to write an article on the fattest kid in the country (Terry from Tottenham). With a photograph wife of the finance secretary heading into the London Bullion Company, Freddy leaves the office to \\"chase the story\\". Amelia and Oliver have a fight, which results in Amelia changing his out of office reply during lunch resulting in some high-ranking officials at the treasury receiving an embarrassing response. Meeting his \\"source\\" in an underground parking garage, Freddy is punched during a misunderstanding. The newspaper is beaten by The Sun, who under exclusive contract with Gary from Glasgow, they beat the newspaper and Terry in the fattest kid ranking, while Oliver suggests fattening up Terry to regain the title. The finance secretary announces his resignation after it is revealed that his wife was stashing gold bullion and was prompted by Oliver's \\"coded-messages\\" in his out of office replies. Episode 4 The Politics Minute has been further cut to 38 seconds while Oliver has hired model and television star Debbie de Winter as guest columnist. Tasneem and Freddy are excited, while Maddox hates that a reality- television star is given space to write for the newspaper. Debbie hands in her copy and demands that no one rewrite her article, with Oliver eventually talking her around to having Maddox work with Debbie. Amelia discovers a story that several bankers are on the roof of Canary Wharf, drunk and throwing empty champagne bottles off. Excited for a free two-night stay in a 5-star hotel in Inverness, Maddox is disappointed that he is being required to co-write the articles with Debbie. He's even more annoyed when Oliver suggests scrapping the Scotland trip and pulling the review he was due to write from other travel sites. A public school photograph of the bankers at Canary Wharf emerges, showing Freddy in the background who is worried that his reputation as a \\"street-kid\\" will be ruined. In revenge for his cancelled trip, Maddox publishes his hotel article based on negative online reviews before discovering that the hotel is owned by a newspaper advertiser. Episode 5 The newspaper misreports that the Prime Minister was opening a new primary school, but in fact he never got into the building due to a \\"security alert\\". Amelia attempts to get Maddox to write an article on \\"turnip crinkle disease\\" affecting East Anglia, much to his annoyance while Maddox instead is more interested about the security threat and why there would be one in Chichester. Amelia and Oliver have another argument when Oliver tries to get her to view an apartment before signing the contract, however Amelia is happy with the current affair arrangements. Maddox returns from Chichester after finding that the PM is suffering depression, and is receiving help from a television psychiatrist. Oliver and Maddox are invited by the Prime Minister's wife to Downing Street who attempts to get them not to publish the story as she is concerned for his welfare. After they leave, the PM's wife calls her husband to tell him \\"it didn't work and it has to be plan B\\". The PM invites the pair to a face-to-face meeting as a delaying tactic the following morning, and instead goes on a talk show to admit his problem. Episode 6 In morning conference, Oliver announces that when each employee returns to their desk, they will find a letter announcing they are fired with employees being able to reapply for their positions. Continuing his piece on a hacker awaiting extradition to the United States, Maddox believes he can \\"go out with a bang\\" however Freddy is dubious. Amelia learns that Oliver intervened with the board on her behalf to keep her job safe, much to her dismay as she wishes to be treated the same as everybody else. Amelia decides to end the relationship. Freddy returns from Swindon after doing his own research on the hacker, finding background information about his family and childhood as he pushes Maddox to introduce a personal and entertainment angle. Tasneem and Oliver discuss her marketing ideas including space travel vouchers, recipe cards, and a Westlife CD, which Oliver does not take very well. Freddy is happy that Maddox took his advice seriously while writing the hacker article. During discussion with Oliver, Maddox finds out that the hackers extradition was won but he has a criminal history for cruelty to animals which Freddy failed to uncover. Looking at the prospect of bad press, Oliver is fired by phone call. Series 2 Episode 1 Maddox returns after two-weeks off which was originally supposed to be for a dental appointment. Upon being called into Oliver's office, he finds that the newspaper has settled prior to a libel lawsuit for comments made during the Politics Minute, which Oliver announces he is also suspending. Maddox returns to his desk to find replacement news editor Carol waiting at his desk who is annoyed at his extended time away. Masha and Carol discuss the new paywall which has seen Maddox earn 35 pence for his published content. Freddy and Maddox discuss the lawsuit, which Freddy questions due to the low viewing figures on his vodcast. Maddox heads out to meet Keith, the initiator of the lawsuit who takes some prompting to remember who Maddox is. He reveals that someone from a law firm contacted him and offered money to begin the lawsuit. Freddy receives a phone call and finds Maddox has been lying about his dental problems and instead visited a health retreat. Maddox leans on the law firm to return the money before he reports them to the solicitors regulator. Carol is given the job of presenting the Politics Minute, but has it quickly taken away again and given back to Maddox. Episode 2 While throwing out a number of letters and deleting a bunch of emails which don't interest him, Maddox almost deletes an email from a whistle blower on a Midlands hospital. The source reports that the hospital is in poor hygiene and that health and safety is ignored, and encloses a number of photographs. Freddy prompts him that his whistle blower may be uncovered, however Maddox is adamant he won't give up the source. Carol chastises both Maddox and Freddy for their expenses related to recent stories they worked on. Maddox is handed a judgement on revealing his source for the hospital story, after missing a summons hearing after not reading the letter, with failure to give the source meaning that Maddox could go to prison. Looking to Oliver for help with a lawyer, Oliver refuses and tells him to give up the source. After leaving a lunch with Carol and Oliver, Maddox is arrested and taken to prison to share a cell with Dangerous Brian. Maddox gives up the name of the source, and then settles into a depression after release from prison. Freddy analyses footage of the source being arrested, spotting that although she is a \\"cleaning lady\\", she is not what she appears. He finds that she is contracted to a private cleaning contractor and placed in the hospital as a plant in an attempt to get the company she works for a cleaning contract. Maddox prepares for early retirement due to his shame, but is cheered by the discovery. Episode 3 Maddox has to listen to details of Freddy's upcoming date with Brazilian Maria, who he discovers on Bebo. Meanwhile, writing an article on palm oil, Maddox targets chocolate manufacturers Cramtons for their use of the product. Meanwhile, Carol wishes to rid the video comments of anyone not deemed stylish or beautiful enough, much to the annoyance of Masha. Oliver rejects Maddox's copy on the palm oil article, preferring to allow the British National Party to advertise in the space instead. Maddox organises a protest, however only five protesters against the advert arrive in the newspaper lobby. Downcast, Maddox enlists Freddy's help to gain more protesters using social media. Meanwhile, Masha brings in a number of awful actors to present the video comments, however Carol complains they aren't good enough; resulting in the original commenter‚Äôs being restored. A group is started on Facebook calling for a protest against the newspaper if the advert is run, with Oliver finally deciding to pull the advert to avoid more bad press. Freddy is also delighted as the adverts removal puts him in good favour with politically active Maria. In place of the BNP advert, Oliver publishes a Cramtons advert, which immensely annoys Maddox as he reveals to Freddy that the company is hated around the world; especially in Brazil. Episode 4 Carol and Maddox get into an argument after she asks him to cover a story on an overweight Orangutan eating a Big Mac, which she tries to sell as an animal rights issue. Freddy receives a phone call from a bank worker with a tip-off that a Liberal Democrat MP Julie Compton has withdrawn ¬£50,000, which Maddox suspects is a sign of upcoming corruption. Maddox heads over to a select committee meeting she is due to attend along with Freddy. Princess Arabella, 22nd in line to the thrown, is looking to change her public image and is due to visit the newspaper which excites Masha immensely. On the stakeout, Maddox and Freddy wait in a car park as the MP and observe the MP handing over the bag containing the money to a man who they follow to the Packham Pensioners Club. Talking with Masha, Freddy reveals he knows Princess Arabella from school and is willing to introduce her and Masha. Carol is more interested however in the rumours that the princess has been sleeping with Wayne Rooney and wants to broach the question on camera. Maddox meets with the MP and confronts her with what he knows, who eventually reveals that she is paying out of her own pocket for the pensioners lunch club due to funding cuts. Maddox still plans to run the story as her actions are going against government austerity policy which causes Julie to resign. The princess cancels her visit, leaving Carol irate and Freddy with the Orangutan story which needs to be rewritten as it has died of too many burgers. Episode 5 Maddox is reading a book from author Miles Deanbrook who he plans to do an interview with. Freddy constantly harangues him for reading what he calls pretentious drivel, but Maddox manages to talk him round to reading it in exchange for copy corrections for the next week. In private, Oliver reveals that he has to make cuts, and wants Carol to get everyone to take a 25% pay cut. Masha is unhappy at the pay-cut news, and even more annoyed that Carol is not taking a cut due to her being a manager. After reading the book, Freddy notices the book appears to be written to a formula and enlists Masha in finding the oddity of the book. At a meal with Deanbrook, Maddox is interrupted by Freddy who begins to question Miles that his adjectives are all in alphabetical order, and that characters appear at regular intervals. Freddy confronts Miles that he knows he has been using a piece of software to write the book for him. Maddox writes up the piece which Oliver praises, however spikes the piece after Deanbrook is admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a breakdown, with the piece being replaced by 2,000 words on sex addiction. Masha has been hacking into the payroll computers and finds Oliver's bonus has gone up by ¬£50,000 from the previous year before using Maddox to blackmail Oliver to run the piece on Deanbrook and review the pay cuts. Episode 6 Oliver has to take a few days away from the office, and Maddox is suspicious of his excuse. Masha reveals that he is also learning Russian. Snooping on the future events calendar, Freddy and Maddox find that unscrupulous Russian oligarch Andrei Zinoviev is docked on the Isle of Wight and visiting for the same period Oliver is away. Carol puts Freddy onto a story on actress Isabella Hudson who is donating a kidney, but Carol wants dirt. Arriving at Oliver's office, Maddox confronts him on his meeting at which Oliver admits the newspaper is likely to be sold to the billionaire. Maddox suggests running a piece he had previously spiked on the Russian, and that a co-operative business model would be better than being taken over by the billionaire, but Oliver quickly rejects the likeliness of the idea. Looking at a long lens photograph of Isabella taken on a private beach, Maddox spots that there is no scar from the operation. Planning on extinction of species to fuel a vast mark-up, Oliver is uncomfortable talking to Andrei as he announces that the contracts are due to be signed tomorrow. Maddox sneaks on to the yacht and is caught by Zinoviev's guards, but managed to retrieve a document from the office which reveals that Oliver is due to be fired by the new owner despite promises to the contrary. Further digging by Freddy finds that Isabella lied about the donation for publicity, with her agents buying a kidney for the recipient to prevent the bad press. Zinoviev pulls his bid after Oliver threatens to run the previous piece, leaving the newspaper in financial trouble. Oliver announces that the newspaper is going online-only in a cash- saving effort.

The 18th century  The first lighthouse in what was to become Canada, (the second on the entire coast of North America after Little Brewster Island in Boston Harbour which was built in 1713), went into service at the French fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island in 1734. Louisbourg Lighthouse is one of the most famous light houses in Canada. Patterned after the :fr:Phare des Baleines built off La Rochelle in 1682, the Louisbourg Light was destroyed by British troops during the siege of 1758, and not rebuilt until 1842; the rubble of the original tower is still visible at the base of the current lighthouse, which dates from 1923. Next came the Sambro Island Light in 1760. Located at the entrance to Halifax harbor, it has been upgraded over the years but remains the oldest continuously operating lighthouse in North America, predating New Jersey's Sandy Hook Light by 4 years, and such venerable lighthouses as Virginia's Cape Henry Light, Maine's photogenic Portland Head Light, and Long Island's Montauk Point Light by three decades. Another early lighthouse in the Maritime provinces, at Cape Roseway dates from 1788 when Shelburne was booming as the largest settlement of United Empire Loyalists on the continent. The octagonal masonry tower on McNutts Island, Nova Scotia was braced with wooden timbers and had a clapboard exterior, and unfortunately was damaged beyond repair by fire after being hit by lightning in 1959. In 1791 the first lighthouse was built at the entrance to Saint John on Partridge Island, New Brunswick. Six years earlier, the first immigration quarantine station in Canada had been established there. The other major quarantine station, at Grosse Ile, Quebec, was built as a hasty response to the cholera epidemic of 1832. In that same year, the original lighthouse at Partridge Island was destroyed by fire. In 1859 the second lighthouse was equipped with the first steam-powered fog whistle, an invention of Robert Foulis. The third Partridge Island lighthouse was operational from 1880 until it was replaced by a concrete octagonal tower in 1959.  Early 19th century  John Ford designed Gibraltar Point Lighthouse on what is now known as the Toronto Islands in 1829. It was decommissioned in 1907, but remains as the oldest existing lighthouse on the Great Lakes, since the one built in 1804 at the mouth of the Niagara River was demolished to make room for Fort Mississauga during the War of 1812. Other early lighthouses on Lake Ontario included False Ducks Island in 1828, Point Petre in 1831, Nine Mile Point in 1833, and Presqu'ile in 1840. The latter two are still standing, although Presqu'ile had its lantern removed in 1965. In that same year, False Duck was demolished and its lantern eventually became the centrepiece of Mariner's Memorial Lighthouse Park and Museum near Milford ON. Meanwhile, in Lower Canada (i.e. Quebec), an organisation named after the British Trinity House was established in 1805. One of their first projects was to have Edward Cannon erect a circular build a lighthouse on Ile Verte at the treacherous junction of the Saguenay and Saint Lawrence rivers. The masonry tower of 1809 vintage is the third-oldest Canadian lighthouse, and served as a model for those built downstream at Pointe des Monts in 1830, at Southwest Point and Heath Point (the eastern tip) on shipwreck haven Anticosti Island in 1835, at South Pillar and Ile Bicquette in 1843, and at Ile Rouge in 1848. Cape Spear lightbouse In 1813 the earliest lighthouse on Newfoundland was built at Fort Amherst to mark \\"The Narrows\\" of St. John's harbor. Cape Spear and Cape Bonavista were built by Britain's Trinity House in 1836 and 1843, receiving the old reflector lamp apparatus from Scotland's famous Inchkeith and Bell Rock lighthouses, respectively. The shipbuilding boom in Canada's Atlantic Provinces prompted a flurry of lighthouse construction, starting in 1829 with Head Harbour on Franklin D. Roosevelt's beloved Campobello Island (New Brunswick) in the Bay of Fundy. In 1832 the original 1809 lighthouse on Brier Island at the tip of Digby Neck in Nova Scotia was replaced; the current lighthouse dates from 1944. An important beacon was built in 1830 on desolate Seal Island, Nova Scotia, offshore and at the gateway to the Bay of Fundy. The timbers of its octagonal tower have proven to be amazingly durable, although the 1903-vintage lantern and its 1st- order Fresnel lens were replaced (and moved to a replica lighthouse museum in Barrington Passage) in 1979. In fact the eight-sided wooden pattern was used in many subsequent Canadian lighthouses, notably by John Cunningham, in 1845 at wave-washed Gannet Rocks in the Bay of Fundy. The eight-sided wooden pattern was used at Port Burwell on Lake Erie, and in 1840 at Cape Forchu marking the entrance to Yarmouth harbor. In 1962 the original Yarmouth light was replaced by a distinctive concrete tower known locally as \\"the applecore\\". On Cape Breton Island after 1826, the General Mining Association consolidated the mines around Sydney Harbour and greatly increased the shipping of coal to ports on the Atlantic coast.Hornsby, Stephen J., Nineteenth Century Cape Breton, A Historical Geography, McGill/Queen‚Äôs University Press, 1992, pp. 95-110. In support of this effort, a lighthouse was built at Low Point in 1832 to aid vessels entering Sydney Harbour. This first lighthouse was an octagonal wood tower, 69 feet high, with red and white stripes and a red round iron lantern containing a third-order double bullseye lens manufactured in France by Barbier, Benard, et Turenne. This first Low Point Lighthouse was replaced in 1932 with an octagonal concrete lighthouse, surmounted by a rare circular iron lantern housing, painted red, the only remaining circular lantern in Nova Scotia; built by Chance Brothers, England's famous builders of lenses and lanterns, currently housing a rotating DCB-36 (36 inch diameter) aerobeacon. Numerous shipwrecks led to the construction in 1839 of lighthouses at Scatari Island and at both ends of St. Paul Island, Nova Scotia. The original towers were of traditional wood construction, but when the south light burned down in 1914 it was replaced by a cast-iron cylindrical tower; the north tower was replaced c. 1970. The conical brick tower built during 1845-7 at Point Prim is the oldest lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. It was designed and built by Isaac Smith, the same eminent architect who designed Province House in Charlottetown.Dictionary of Architects in Canada Isaac Smith Around mid- century, the use of whale or seal oil as lantern fuel was alleviated by the development of kerosene by Dr. Abraham Pineo Gesner. Cape Pine lighthouse Cape Race lighthouse In 1851, a 40-year-old mechanism from the Isle of May in Scotland was installed atop Newfoundland's new Cape Pine lighthouse. The tower was designed by the firm Alexander S. Gordon using the same prefabricated cast-iron approach as Gibbs Hill Lighthouse and other outposts of the British Empire. Subsequently, despite being unsuitable for the damp and cold winters, many cast-iron lighthouses were built in Newfoundland, including Channel-Port aux Basques in 1875, Lobster Cove Head in 1892, and the lighthouse which now guards the National Museum of Science & Technology which, after 50 years of service at Cape Race, was dismantled and re-erected with a new lantern at Cape North (NS) in 1906. Then in 1980, after a local outcry had kept the Seal Island lantern from being taken away, the historic lighthouse at the northern tip of Cape Breton was instead targeted for relocation to Ottawa. In 1884, public clamour following the 1867 Queen of Swansea tragedy led to a cast-iron lighthouse being erected at the summit of Gull Island, off Newfoundland's Bay de Verde peninsula. At an elevation of , it is the highest light on the eastern seaboard.  The Imperial Lights, 1857-60  Cap-des-Rosiers Lighthouse, Quebec, built in 1858. A National Historic Site of Canada. By the mid 19th century it was apparent that the economic development of British North America was being hampered by obsolete navigational aids. Lobbying by the Admiralty and by Canadian shipping magnates such as Montreal's Hugh Allan resulted in an ambitious three-year building program, where all material and construction costs would be borne by Great Britain. The so-called Imperial Towers were tall conical towers of brick or masonry construction where, in some cases, the granite was quarried and prepared by Scottish stonemasons, and shipped to the colony as ballast. By 1850s standards they must have seemed imperial, i.e. built to withstand the ages. Henri Maurice Perrault designed lighthouses in Lotbini√®re, Quebec (1860); Pointe-aux-Trembles, Quebec (1862); L'Islet, Quebec (1865); Port St. Francis, Quebec on Lake St. Peter (1865); Isle aux Prunes opposite Verch√®res, Quebec (1866); and a movable lighthouse at Isle aux Raisins, Quebec (1867). Four towers were built along the approaches to the Saint Lawrence: at on the Gaspe peninsula; in the Strait of Belle Isle; at Pointe Amour near L'Anse Amour on the Labrador coast; and at West Point on Anticosti Island. At 112 feet (34 m), the latter rivalled Cap des Rosiers as the tallest lighthouse in Canada until its replacement by an airport-type beacon and demolition in 1967. Point clark lighthouse Six Imperial Towers were built on Lake Huron and Georgian Bay in Ontario, all first lit in 1858 or 1859, because commercial shipping traffic was increasing on the Great Lakes between Canada and the U.S. due to new trade agreements and the opening of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal locks in 1855. These are located at Point Clark, on Chantry Island, Ontario and on islands named Nottawasaga, Christian, Griffith, and Cove. Construction of these limestone towers was entrusted to John Brown (1808‚Äì76).http://www.lighthousedigest.com/digest/StoryPage.cfm?StoryKey=156 They were all tall, with the exception of Christian Island, a tower comparable to Brown's 1858 lighthouse at Burlington, Ontario. The lighthouses at Point Clark, Chantry Island and Cove Island have been renovated and all six are currently automated lights. The other three vary in terms of the current condition; Griffith (on a private island), and especially Nottawasaga, are in greatest need of restoration.http://www.brucecoastlighthouses.com/lighthouses/ The Point Clark tower was formally registered as one of the National Historic Sites of Canada, the only lighthouse on the Great Lakes or Georgian Bay to receive this highest-level designation.http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep- reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16772&pid;=0 Construction of the wooden lighthouse built on a caisson offshore from Point Pelee in Lake Erie was also undertaken in 1859; it was replaced in 1902 by a lighthouse built of steel plates, which can be seen today at Lakeview Park in Windsor. The Fleet Street Lighthouse in Toronto harbour was built in the 1860s and in 1913 was moved to the corner of Lake Shore Boulevard and Fleet Street, where it can be seen today. The recently restored lighthouse at Brandy Pot Island near Riviere du Loup (PQ) dates from 1862, the same year a wooden lighthouse was built on Bellechasse Island. Kivas Tully designed a Lighthouse and Keeper's House, at Queen's Wharf, Tonronto, Ontario in 1861. The lighthouse was relocated in 1929 at Lake Shore Boulevard West and Fleet Street.Globe [Toronto], 14 June 1861, 3, t.c. Fisgard Lighthouse, Vancouver Island, BC Offshore from Vancouver Island on Canada's Pacific coast, the Imperial lighthouses at Race Rocks and what is now Fisgard Lighthouse National Historic Site were built by Herman Otto Tiedemann in 1860 to safeguard the approaches to the Royal Navy base at Esquimalt. An interesting screw-pile lighthouse was built at Sandheads off the mouth of the Fraser river in 1880; it was demolished in 1913 and replaced by a lightship. After building a long jetty to stabilize the channel location, in 1960 a new lighthouse was built at Sandheads.  Latter 19th century  The new Dominion of Canada undertook another round of lighthouse building following Confederation. The 1870s saw well over 100 new lighthouses go into operation; during this period Sable Island, \\"the graveyard of the Atlantic\\", and Bird Rock, an outcrop of the Magdalen Islands archipelago, were finally lit. Miscou lighthouse 1930 A great number of lighthouses built during the 19th century were tapering wooden towers, usually four or eight-sided. They had the advantage of being cheap to build, and in some cases could be relocated if the site was threatened by erosion. Surviving examples include Miscou Island and Mulholland Point (on Campobello Island) in New Brunswick, Margaretsville (NS), and Panmure Island, East Point, North Cape, West Point, Cape Bear, and Woods Island on Prince Edward Island. Many of the towers from the 1870-1900 period were attached to the dwelling, for example Peases Islandhttp://data2.archives.ca/ap/c/c086497.jpg and East Ironbound Island in Nova Scotia, Hope Island in Georgian Bay, or the second lighthouse at Cap Gaspe in Quebec. Their ranks include a number of picturesque harbour or range lights such as Grande Anse in NB and New London rear range light in PEI. John Corbett moved to Ottawa, Ontario in 1880 after receiving the appointment of superintendent of lighthouse construction in the Marine Department. He died in 1887. Unfortunately, there is a long list of wooden lighthouses which burned down, including the second one at Cape Ray in Newfoundland, the one on Ile Haute in the Bay of Fundy, Holland Rock in BC, and the one on remote Greenly Island, south of Labrador. The latter made headlines in 1928 when the German aircraft Bremen crash-landed thereafter making the first successful east-west transatlantic flight.  Colonel Anderson's Tenure, 1900-14  In the 1870s responsibility for navigational aids was transferred from the Department of Public Works to the Department of Marine and Fisheries. In 1904 the department's Lighthouse Board was given a broader mission, and its dynamic chairman Colonel William P. Anderson planned an ambitious construction program. Various coastal beacons were upgraded from reflector-type to state- of-the-art Fresnel lenses, manufactured by Barbier, B√©nard & Turenne of Paris (), or Chance Brothers of Birmingham (UK). In order to lessen the dependence on such foreign suppliers, the Dominion Lighthouse Depot was established in a former starch factory at Prescott, Ontario in 1903. Numerous old wooden towers were replaced by reinforced concrete or prefabricated cast-iron towers, examples being Metis, Cap de la Madeleine, Cap Chat and Matane on the Gaspe peninsula, Cape Croker on Georgian Bay, and Cape Race in Newfoundland. The latter was perhaps the most important landfall beacon for North Atlantic traffic, and remains one of a handful of lighthouses in the world equipped with a giant hyperradiant Fresnel lens. It also boasted a new diaphone or compressed-air fog horn, a 1902 invention of Toronto's J.P. Northery Ltd. In 1904, the pre-fabricated cast-iron lighthouse at Fame Point, near Anse-a- Valleau on the Gaspe coast, became the first maritime wireless (Marconi) station in North America. In 1977, this lighthouse was dismantled and became a tourist attraction in Quebec City, but it was returned to its original site in 1997 and the whole light station, known today as Pointe-√†-la-Renomm√©e, has been restored. To support the higher-order lenses (which floated in a bath of mercury), exposed ferro-concrete towers were sometimes buttressed, such as at Point Atkinsonhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:W060326_lighthouse_park_023_adj.JPG in Lighthouse Park near Vancouver BC, Natashquan Point in Quebec, Ile Parisienne in Lake Superior, or at Langara and Sheringham Point on Vancouver Island. In 1910 one of these towers was built at the windswept summit of Triangle Island, off the northern tip of Vancouver Island. However, this turned out to be a costly blunder; at an elevation of , the light was far too high to be visible in bad weather. After 10 years, the lantern was dismantled and brought back to the Coast Guard base in Victoria while the original plan of building a lighthouse at Cape Scott was carried out in 1927. Construction of Pointe-au-P√®re lighthouse The art of building tall lighthouses using reinforced concrete reached its ultimate expression in the flying buttresses of Estevan Point on the Pacific Coast, at Michipicoten Island and remote Caribou Island in Lake Superior, at Northeast Belle Isle in the Strait of Belle Isle, at Bagot Bluff on Anticosti Island, and at Pointe-au-Pere near Rimouski, Quebec. At the latter ranks with Point Amour Lighthouse as Canada's second-tallest lighthouse. Some lighthouses from the early 1900s were of traditional 8-sided timber construction, such as at Point Riche near Port au Choix, Newfoundland, Henry Island in Cape Breton (NS), at La Martre, Quebec (site of a museum) on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Lonely Island in Lake Huron, or at Pachena Point on Vancouver Island, site of the terrible 1906 shipwreck of the SS Valencia. However, the vast majority of post-1910 lighthouses replicated the octagonal pattern using the new ferro-concrete construction technique. Examples are Peggy's Cove and Western Island (NS), Cap Gaspe :File:Forillon National Park of Canada 4.jpg and Cap au Saumon (PQ), and Machias Seal Island (NB). This style was carried to impressive height (102 feet) at Cape Sable Island (NS), Long Point in Lake Erie, and Great Duck Island in Lake Huron. The ornate Point Abino Light Tower near Fort Erie, Ontario dates from 1917. It was built as a memorial to the crew of the Buffalo-based US Lightship #82 which went down with all hands during the infamous Great Lakes Storm of 1913, which claimed a total of twelve ships and 235 lives.

The synagogue was in use in the Second Temple period (50 BCE-100 CE), one of several found to date from that period and includes a carved stone representing the menorah, the seven-branched candelabrum that was located in the Temple, making it the oldest such representation in a Jewish context and one that appears to have been made by an individual who had seen the Menorah in the Temple. It is one of the Oldest synagogues in Israel. The historic synagogue was discovered in 2009 during a salvage dig conducted by Dr. Dina Avshalom-Gorni of the Israel Antiquities Authority at the location of a new hotel at Migdal Beach, the site of ancient Magdala. Magdala was a fishing town that was mentioned in Jewish documents of the period as a major site during the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War (66‚Äì73 CE) at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and is also mentioned in Christian texts as the home community of Mary Magdalene.

The walls were decorated with elaborately designed and colored frescos and the floor is partially made of mosaics. The Migdal site is just one of seven synagogues known to date back to the Second Temple period, with the relative scarcity of such houses of worship explained by the prevailing religious practice of making pilgrimages to the Temple in Jerusalem for the Shalosh regalim‚Äîthe three annual pilgrimage festivals of Pesach (Passover), Shavuot (Weeks) and Sukkot (Tabernacles)‚Äîas the primary form of worship at the time.Flower, Kevin. \\"Ancient synagogue found in Israel\\", CNN, September 11, 2009.

Dr. Avshalom-Gorni called the discovery \\"an exciting and unique find. This is the first time that a menorah decoration has been discovered from the days when the Second Temple was still standing. This is the first menorah to be discovered in a Jewish context and that dates to the Second Temple period/beginning of the Early Roman period. We can assume that the engraving that appears on the stone, which the Israel Antiquities Authority uncovered, was done by an artist who saw the seven-branched menorah with his own eyes in the Temple in Jerusalem\\".Note the carving is correctly described as a relief, not an engraving or intaglioThe large six petal rosette relief atop the stone was a common design in Jewish funerary art during the Second Temple period. Its meaning is yet unknown but it is also found among the ruins of Gamla on a lintel stone flanked by two palm trees.

The episode aired on September 28, 2009.  Plot  Hearing about Annie's death, Noah visits Claire to offer his condolences. Gretchen charms him into allowing her to tag along on their lunch outing. Noah is angry to discover that Gretchen knows about Claire's ability. He attempts to have her memory wiped but Claire tells him she does not need him to fight her battles. Noah reluctantly accepts. Claire decides to not be secretive any more and allows Gretchen to ask her anything. She invites her to be her new roommate. At the carnival, Samuel mixes up a special batch of ink as he prepares to venture out into our world. He remarks to Lydia that he has found someone he believes can fill the place left absent by his late brother Joseph. He reveals that he used to be forced to dress all prim and proper by his parents when he was young, but when he discovered his ability, he felt he was free to be \\"filthy\\". Since Joseph's death, he feels as though he is without a sense of direction. As he draws the ink into his hand, Lydia suggests that he visits his old home while he is out. Elsewhere Peter hangs up another newspaper clipping depicting the survival of all the passengers of an MTA bus crash thanks to his heroic efforts. However he soon discovers that no good deed goes unpunished when he discovers he is being sued by a William Hooper for injuring him in the midst of his rescue. Across town, Emma Coolidge reluctantly wakes up and heads out to work, donning a pair of headphones that are not attached to anything. On her way out, she notices a strange light coming out of the sink, but she quickly dismisses it as a reflection of sunlight. Peter visits Emma in the file room to request the file on William Hooper. Emma directs him to a sign stating that all requests must be written. Peter rambles on until he realizes she's not listening and notices her headphones are not attached to anything. As Emma hands him the file she accidentally knocks her coffee mug off the table. As it shatters on the floor, she is flustered to see a stream of colors leap from the shards. Peter goes to find William Hooper in physical therapy where he is actually met by Samuel pretending to be him. Peter does not remember seeing him at the crash site even though he insists he was. Peter leaves deciding to let the lawyers handle it when Samuel suggests that he could be so overworked that the fatigue caused a lapse in his memory. Meanwhile, Emma has her mother check her vision out, only to have Dr. Coolidge not find anything wrong with it and suggest that she has developed synesthesia and that her body is trying to tell her to stop filing and start healing patients. She defends herself saying she likes her job and does not like interaction with people because she cannot stand the look on their faces when they realize she is deaf. Samuel sneaks into Peter's apartment and uses his ink to imprint his image into the photo on the newspaper clipping, which convinces Peter that it is true. Peter meets Samuel and apologizes. He consoles Samuel over his loss and realizing Peter is the kind of person he is looking for, he shakes his hand and drops the charges. Samuel goes to visit his old home, only to be kept away because a party is going on inside, so in his anger, he uses his ability to sink the house and its party guests into the ground. Emma sits in a park and plays a cello, revealing a dazzling array of colors, but after she realizes she drew attention to herself, she shyly leaves. As Matt gets ready for work, he sees Sylar in the mirror and pulls his gun out, only to find he is not there. Matt and his partner Green go to make a drug bust on a guy named Keppler. While Green takes a call from the District Attorney, Matt argues with Sylar in his head, stating that he is willing to keep Sylar in his head forever if it means keeping people safe from him. When Green returns with news that the warrant is on its way to break into the house to search for Keppler, Sylar continues to toy with Matt, eventually revealing that Keppler is hiding in a nearby closet with a gun. Matt gets out of the way before he fires and then grabs Keppler, wrestling him to the floor. Matt and Green handcuff him to a chair downstairs while they search the house for the drugs. As Matt searches in the bathroom, Sylar asks Matt to look for something that does not belong. He finds a bunny doll stuffed behind the toilet as Sylar tells him Keppler is hiding something, but that it is something worse than drugs. Matt goes downstairs and riffles through some papers until he stumbles upon a ransom note. He grills Keppler about it and then finally pushes his thoughts into Keppler to tell him where the hostage is after he gives into Sylar's taunts. Keppler tells him that she is under the stairs and Matt quickly runs there only to find the little girl dead. Enraged, he begins to beat up Keppler, only to have Green return after finding the drugs in the garage. When Matt goes to show him the girl, they find she is not there and that the ransom note and bunny have also disappeared. Sylar then reveals that he used Matt's power against him. When Green tells Matt he went too far and that he cannot back him up, Matt pushes the thought into Green's mind that he was attacked by Keppler and Matt defended himself. With this new memory in his head, Green goes out to call in the bust and Sylar congratulates Matt on becoming more like him. Sylar gives Matt an ultimatum: either everyday can be like this, or Matt can find Sylar's body. Critical reception Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club rated this episode a C+.

It is a perennial aquatic plant that exist in fresh standing water or in lakes and rivers with slight currents. Description Cabomba aquatica mainly propagate by detachment of stem portions from the mother plant, and have adventitious roots that are produced in the nodes. Their stems consist of horizontal basal portions as well as ascendant portions that usually reach the surface during flower production. The stems may grow up to 20 inches (50 centimeters). The leaves of the Cabomba aquatica are floating and they produce exclusively at the apical parts of the stem; this usually accompanies flower production. The first floating leaf of this plant will always appear at the same node as the submerged apical leaf. The plant has orbicular leaves and the stems have fine and longitudinal striations which are red most of the time. Red striations may also occur on the petioles. In Cabomba aquatica, one ovule is produced from each carpel and the pollen to ovule ratio is of ca. 1000:1. This plant is facultatively xenogamous; and during fruiting, it will develop one carpel in an indehiscent and follicle-like fruit. The shape of the seed is usually oval. Distribution and habitat Cabomba aquatica is commonly known as fanwort or giant cabomba. It originated from South America. The plant does well in an aquatic condition with fresh hard water and minimal light. The plant thrives between a pH of 6-7.5 and a temperature of 72-82 degrees Fahrenheit. Uses and culture Cabomba aquatica is beneficial to lakes, dams, and even rivers because they produce oxygen and take in carbon dioxide; this helps in the overall functioning of the particular water body. The plant also provides food to some marine animals as well as other wildlife. Hence, they help maintain the aquatic ecosystem. Cabomba aquatica is also important in the aquatic ecosystem because it acts as an efficient accumulator of heavy metals in water bodies. This plant has great potential for the phytoremediation of water with heavy metals. Other aquatic plants that may serve the same purpose include: Vallisneria spiralis and Echinodorus cordifolius. This property makes these plants perfect candidates for researching, modeling, and testing various ecological theories on plant succession and evolution, as well as on metal and nutrient cycling. Cabomba aquatica is easy to culture in the laboratory and; hence, reliable items for ecotoxicological investigations. Grown plants are transferred into nutrient solution and further grown in aquariums whose environments are controlled. The aquariums should be equipped with fluorescent tubes to produce 14/10 h light (dark photoperiods) at a temperature of 24-28C. The plant is left for 3 days so as to acclimatize.

He was raised in Villa Diamante and lived there until the age of 10. After a flood in 1968, he moved back to Monte Grande. His father and stepfather were musicians. He first learned from his father, an \\"orchestra man\\", playing the high-hat with one foot, the kick drum with the other foot, the guitar, and the harmonica. He used to performed at El Chaco province in Argentina. Salinas's first time playing the guitar was at the age of five with his stepdad, accompanying him on a Chamam√©. After hearing him and his father playing music, or after being in a musical environment, he used to stay in his room and practice what he had heard. He owned his first guitar when he was twenty-seven years old. He borrowed guitars from friends in the neighborhood until they realized he kept them too long, and then they refused to lend them to him. He is self-taught. His best teachers were the records he played by his favorite musicians, which included Joe Pass, Wes Montgomery, Oscar Alem√°n, and Baden Powell. He learned from a Brazilian guitarist at the pub El Papagayo. He played at the pub for eight years, which started his career. Collaborations Universal Music Group asked him to play with B.B. King in Rio de Janeiro. Salinas replied that he would do it if it was acceptable to King. He got a response from Universal that said King was fascinated by his music, which Salinas found hard to believe. He met King at the soundcheck and King said, \\"You can can play the last song, and if people like it we can keep playing some more\\". They ended up playing four more songs. He has also worked with Adolfo Abalos, Bir√©li Lagr√®ne, Danilo P√©rez, Dave Holland, George Benson, Hermeto Pascoal, Mar√≠a Gra√±a, Mercedes Sosa, Paco de Luc√≠a, Sylvain Luc, and Tomatito. Critical reception Judith Schlesinger writing in AllMusic describes the song \\"Blue Zamba\\" on his debut album as \\"a lovely solo track that belongs squarely in the tradition of the great Latin acoustic players, but with a whiff of Joe Pass as well.

September 12, 1813), was a royalist military officer during the Mexican war of independence against Spain. He is mostly known for his capture of insurgent leaders Miguel Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende, Jos√© Mariano Jim√©nez, and Juan Aldama at the Wells of Baj√°n, Coahuila in 1811. Initially a supporter of Mexican independence who converted to the royalist cause, Elizondo is sometimes compared to the American Benedict Arnold. In 1813, after a successful campaign against rebel armies he was assassinated by one of his junior officers. Personal life Elizondo was born in the village of Salinas (now Salinas Victoria, Nuevo Le√≥n). He was son of Jos√© Marcos de Elizondo and Mar√≠a Josefa de Villarreal. He was of Spanish and Basque ancestry. During his childhood, Elizondo lived in the village of Pesquer√≠a Grande (present-day Garcia, Nuevo Le√≥n). His father owned many agricultural estates (haciendas). In 1787, at the age of twenty-one he married Mar√≠a Gertrudis. She died on March 6, 1797 while giving birth to his son, Jos√© Rafael Eusebio.\\"'Go Ahead, Guys' vs The Spanish Royal Army; Battle of Medina, Texas, August 18, 1813,\\" Los Bexare√±os, Vol. 2, No. 1, p.11, , accessed 19 Jan 2019 Ignacio Elizondo began his military career in 1798, after being appointed Lieutenant of Pesquer√≠a's provincial militia company. Two years later, he was appointed Captain of the Punta de Lampazos provincial dragoons, one of the largest military units in the New Kingdom of Le√≥n, present day Nuevo Leon. One year later Elizondo returned again to his former position at Pesquer√≠a's provincial militia. In 1806, the governor of Nuevo Le√≥n, Pedro de Herrera y Levya, appointed him to command the Eighth Dragoons, a company, which would operate in Texas against the frequent Apache attacks taking place. Elizondo requested from the Viceroy an exemption from his military command as he was having serious financial problems. He owed money to the Roman Catholic church for livestock and land he had purchased. However, Governor de Herrera, declined to exempt him from his military duties which caused friction between the two men. He subsequently married Maria Romana Carrasco and, in 1806, the couple moved to the Hacienda of San Juan de Canoas, in Coahuila state, where he also administrated the Hacienda of Alamo near the city of Monclova.\\"Go Ahead, Guys\\" Capturing Hidalgo The Mexican War of Independence from Spain began with the \\"grito\\" of the Roman Catholic priest, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, on September 16, 1810. Initially Elizondo, stationed in Texas, took the side of the rebels in the Casas Revolt. Elizondo had the responsibility of guarding royalist prisoners in Monclova, Coahuila. There, or possibly earlier, he was persuaded to join the royalists. Some historians debate whether General Ramon D√≠az de Bustamante or Bishop Primo Feliciano Mar√≠n de Porras won Elizondo over to the royalists.Las andanzas del obispo Mar√≠n de Porras y la traici√≥n de Baj√°n : diplom√°ticos de la insurgencia. by A.

Others believe he was converted by Manuel Mar√≠a de Salcedo of Texas and Sim√≥n de Herrera of Nuevo Le√≥n, while the two royalist governors were his prisoners.Harris, Charles H. (1975), A Mexican Family Empire, Austin: University of Texas Press, p. 127 Elizondo was asked to continue to pretend to support the rebels to gain intelligence about the plans of Allende and Hidalgo who were then in flight toward the United States after a military defeat in the Battle of Calderon Bridge. In March 1811, Hidalgo and Allende, rebel military leaders, and the remnants of the rebel army were in Saltillo, south of Monclova.Almaraz, Jr., Felix D. (April 1996), \\"Texas Governor Manuel Salcedo and the Court-Martial of Padre Miguel Hidalgo,\\" The Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Vol. 99, No. 4, pp. 452-454. Downloaded from JSTOR. The royalist sympathizers in Monclova included a group of large landowners of the region led by Jos√© Melchor Sanchez Navarro.Harris III, p. 131 Deceived into believing that Monclova was safely in the hands of rebel supporters, Allende, Hidalgo, other leaders, and 1,000 men of the rebel army departed Saltillo for Monclova. On March 21, 1811 Elizondo was waiting at the Wells of Baj√°n with 150 men. The rebel leaders arrived first at the wells in carriages. Elizondo greeted them with an honor guard. He led the carriages behind a nearby hill not visible from the remainder of the rebel convoy. There, his men demanded the surrender of the rebel leaders. Padre Hidalgo, on horseback, drew a pistol but was restrained from firing by a royalist soldier. Allende was in the fifth carriage, and Allende opened fire. In the return fire Allende's son and several rebel soldiers were killed. The royalists tied the hands of the rebel leaders and their escorts and escorted them to a makeshift prison camp. This process of capturing elements of the rebel army continued all day long. As each new element arrived they were taken captive by Elizondo's men. By the end of the day the royalists had 893 prisoners and had killed about 40 of the rebels who resisted. The rear guard was the only contingent in the rebel army which sensed the danger and escaped capture.Almaraz, Jr., pp 455-456\\"La Guerra de Independencia.\\" The next day Elizondo divided the prisoners into three groups: the leaders of the rebels including Padre Hidalgo; captured rebel clergymen, and the common soldiers. All prisoners were taken to Monclova first and the lesser offenders remained there for trial. Ten captured clergymen were taken to Durango and 27 military leaders and Hidalgo were taken to Chihuahua for trial. The rebel leaders and many of their followers were executed.Almaraz, pp. 456-457 Royalist soldier After the capture of the rebel leaders, Elizondo was promoted to Lt. Colonel in the royalist army. Given the importance of his capture of the rebel leaders, the reward and the honors he received were modest.\\"Go Ahead, Guys\\"Santos, Richard, \\"Bexar county's forgotten Battle of Alazan Creek,\\" , accessed 23 Jan 2018 On March 29, 1813, the royalist army in Texas lost the Battle of Rosillo Creek and on April 1 the rebels occupied San Antonio. To begin the effort to recover Texas, General Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Arredondo ordered Elizondo to reconnoiter, but not to engage in battle with, the rebel forces of Jos√© Bernardo Guti√©rrez de Lara in San Antonio. With a force of 1,050 men Elizondo crossed the Rio Grande on June 12 and, against Arredondo's orders, camped near San Antonio de Bexar and demanded Guti√©rrez's surrender. On June 20, Guti√©rrez's army of 1,500 men surprised Elizondo in the Battle of Alazan Creek and soundly defeated his forces, forcing Elizondo to retreat to the Rio Grande.Santos General Arredondo ordered Elizondo to join him in an effort to retake the Spanish colony of Texas. With 1,830 men the two commanders advanced from Mexico toward San Antonio. On August 18, 1813, at the Battle of Medina, Elizondo led a cavalry division of the Royal Spanish Army to defeat the 1,400 man rebel Republican Army of the North, crushing the so-called Guti√©rrez‚ÄìMagee Expedition as well as the insurrection in Texas.Robert H. Thonhoff, \\"ELIZONDO, IGNACIO\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed March 22, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Elizondo's last military service to the King of Spain was as the officer in command of a contingent of 500 cavalrymen dispatched by Arredondo from the capital at San Antonio, to chase and mop-up the fleeing survivors of the insurgent army immediately after the Battle of Medina. His last reports (before the incident that led to his death on his return from this successful mission) detail his march along the Camino Real toward eastern Texas, where he captured and executed many of the rebel soldiers at the Spanish hacienda of Trinidad de Salcedo (1807-1813) on Trinity River, which he depopulated and burned (see translation of Elizondo's final reports appended here).Bob D.

Death On September 3, 1813, Elizondo was critically wounded by Lieutenant Miguel (or Manuel) Serrano, while sleeping in his encampment at the edge of the Brazos River. He died a few days later.

Its goal was to provide affordable health care coverage to 98% of Connecticut residents by 2014. The name SustiNet derives from the motto of the State of Connecticut: \\"Qui transtulit sustinet.\\" (Latin: \\"[He] Who Transplanted [Still] Sustains\\"). Provisions The SustiNet law established a nine-member board to recommend to the legislature, by January 1, 2011, the details of and implementation process for a self-insured health care plan called SustiNet. The recommendations will address (1) the phased-in offering of the SustiNet plan to state employees and retirees, HUSKY A and B beneficiaries, people without employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) or with unaffordable ESI, small and large employers, and others; (2) establishing an entity that can contract with insurers and health care providers, set reimbursement rates, develop medical homes for patients, and encourage the use of health information technology; (3) a model benefits package; and (4) public outreach and ways to identify uninsured citizens.Connecticut General Assembly, Office of Legislative Research, \\"OLR Acts Affecting Insurance,\\" July 21, 2009 SustiNet emphasizes preventive care and the management of chronic illnesses. It creates a large health insurance pool by combining state employees, retirees, and people covered by state assistance programs. The pool will also be open to members of the public without insurance, those with inadequate insurance, and employers, starting with small businesses, nonprofits and municipalities. Eventually, SustiNet will be open to larger employers wishing to buy into the plan for their employees. The board establishes committees to make recommendations to it about health information technology, medical homes, clinical care and safety guidelines, and preventive care and improved health outcomes. The act also establishes an independent information clearinghouse to inform employers, consumers, and the public about SustiNet and private health care plans and creates task forces to address obesity, tobacco usage, and health care workforce issues. The effective date of the SustiNet law was July 1, 2009 for most provisions. History Since 2005, Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut has developed relationships with several key groups that would be instrumental in creating broad change in the health system, including medical societies, hospitals, businesses, labor and clergy.Hartford Courant, \\"Connecticut Clergy Pressuring State To Approve Health Insurance Plan\\", March 5, 2009 In January 2009, the foundation unveiled SustiNet, a proposal for a statewide health care plan for Connecticut that would provide residents with their choice of health coverage and care regardless of their employment status, age, or pre-existing conditions.The New York Times, \\"Hartford Hears Health Care Proposal\\", January 16, 2009 An estimated 1,000 people attended a rally at Union Station (Hartford) for the release of the plan.Fairfield County Business Journal, \\"Health care options proliferate\\", January 9, 2009 In February, the 18,500-member Connecticut Association of Realtors announced its support for the SustiNet health care plan. Realtors are independent contractors and are representative of the plight of many independent contractors and small business employees in Connecticut in that they do not have access to group health insurance.Enfield Press, \\"Realtors' Association endorses heallth care proposal\\", February 26, 2009 Also in that month, the independent statewide organization \\"Small Businesses for Health Care Reform\\" endorsed the SustiNet health care reform proposal and encouraged other business owners to review and support it.Record Journal, \\"Universal Health Care Plan Gains Steam\\", February 17, 2009 In March 2009, the foundation's SustiNet plan was formally endorsed by the Interfaith Fellowship for Universal Health Care, a group devoted to health reform, as well as by dozens of other religious leaders representing a wide range of faiths in Connecticut. Fellowship members include Rabbi Stephen Fuchs of Congregation Beth Israel in West Hartford, a co-chairman of the Interfaith Fellowship, and Bilal Ansari, a Muslim chaplain at Saint Francis Hospital & Medical Center in Hartford, where much of his counseling involves helping families cope with not just the stress of a relative's illness, but the worries about how they will pay for it.Hartford Courant, \\"Foundation Presents Plan To Provide Universal Health Coverage\\", January 14, 2009 SustiNet passed its first legislative hurdle Thursday, March 26, receiving an endorsement from the state legislature's Public Health Committee. The committee voted 22-8 to move the bill forward.Hartford Courant, \\"Health Plan Advances\\", March 28, 2009 On April 22, SustiNet received a favorable report from a second committee, the Human Services Committee, which voted 13-6 for the bill.Human Services Committee Vote Tally Sheet, Bill No.: HB-6600, \\"AN ACT CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUSTINET PLAN\\", April 22, 2009 On April 29, SustiNet received a favorable report from a third committee, the Labor and Public Employees Committee, which voted 8-3 for the bill.Labor and Public Employees Committee Tally Sheet, Bill No.: HB-6600, \\"AN ACT CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUSTINET PLAN\\", April 29, 2009 On May 7, 2009, Sustinet received a favorable report from a fourth committee, the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, which voted 13-4 for the bill.Insurance and Real Estate Committee Tally Sheet, Bill No.: HB-6600, \\"AN ACT CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUSTINET PLAN\\", May 7, 2009 On May 20, 2009, the Connecticut House of Representatives voted 107-35 for SustiNet.Hartford Courant, \\"Connecticut House Backs Universal Health Care Coverage\\", May 21, 2009 On May 30, 2009, the Connecticut Senate voted 23-12 for SustiNet.Hartford Courant, \\"Senate Approves Two Controversial Healthcare Bills Saturday\\", May 30, 2009 SustiNet was sent to Governor Jodi Rell, who vetoed it on July 8.\\"Rell Vetoes Controversial Pooling and SustiNet Healthcare Bills\\", Hartford Courant, July 8, 2009 On July 20, 2009, the governor's vetoes were overridden by the Connecticut House of Representatives with a vote of 102 to 40 and then by the Connecticut Senate with a vote of 24-12.\\"House and Senate Both Override Rell on Universal Health Bill\\", Hartford Courant, July 20, 2009 The work of the nine member SustiNet board began in July 2009 and in September two more positions were added to the board.

The community is southeast of Fairfield and about 14 miles outside city limits on U.S. Route 84. Demographics The community has a total population of approximately 1,475. Broken down, there seems to be an equal separation in gender representation with each group accounting for roughly 50% of the population. Population in July 2007: Males: 733 (49.7%), Females: 742 (50.3%) Racial Group Representation: White alone - 760 (54.1%), Black alone - 572 (40.7%), Hispanic - 54 (3.8%), Two or more races - 14 (1.0%), American alone - 3 (0.2%), Asian alone - 1 (0.07%) The average household size is 2.4 people and roughly 57% of the community is a family household, which is well below the state average. Parts of the community are fairly poor with 15% of residents earning income below the poverty level. Schools Butler is served by the Fairfield Independent School District which includes Fairfield Elementary school, Fairfield Intermediate school, and Fairfield High School. Students who wish to pursue higher education, have many options to choose from within reasonable travel distance. These options include Trinity Valley Community College (38 miles), Navarro College (42 miles), UT Tyler (63 miles), Texas State Technical College (67 miles), Tyler Junior College (69 miles), Sam Houston State University (70 miles), and Texas A&M; (73 miles). Landmarks Because Butler is a very small, secluded community the residents find a lack of resources in their area. The nearest hospitals can be located in Fairfield, TX and Palestine, TX 14 miles and 21 miles away respectively. The community is rich in history and geographical diversity. Notable sites in Butler include its many churches, historic cemeteries, lakes and reservoirs, as well as the numerous springs and creeks. History In the early 1850s, several prominent families from Butler County, Alabama, settled in area known a West Point Hill. Over time the settlement grew with the addition of a church in 1854 and the establishment of a post office in 1856. By 1858 the community had a doctor, a general store, several businesses, and a Masonic lodge. The major revenue of the town at that time was from cotton, which was shipped through Galveston by steamboat on the Trinity River. In 1872 the International-Great Northern Railroad attempted to build a line through the town, but an agreement with landowners could not be reached. The railroad instead went through Oakwood and Palestine. In 1880 the population of Butler was 300, but by 1892 it had decreased to 150, primarily due to the lack of a railroad and the decline in steamboat traffic. In 1916, the post office was closed and all mail was sent through the office in Oakwood. By 1969, all schools had been consolidated in Fairfield. Sacred Harp composer Sarah Lancaster lived in Butler for some time with her family.

Completed just too late to see service in the war, West Elcajon was nevertheless commissioned into the U.S. Navy as USS West Elcajon (ID-3907), participating in one postwar famine relief mission to Eastern Europe before decommissioning in May 1919. After decommission, the ship was laid up for several years until resuming service in 1926 as the merchant ship SS West Elcajon, operating between the United States and the Far East. In 1928, she was purchased by the Matson Line, renamed SS Golden Kauri, and employed in the timber trade between the U.S. and Australia. In late 1928, she became embroiled in a violent Australian industrial dispute. In 1938, the ship was renamed SS Waipio, and in 1946 she was sold to Panamanian interests and renamed SS Paralos.

Comdr. Roy W. Look, USNRF, in command. USS West Elcajon commenced her first and only mission for the Navy by loading 7,282 tons of flour consigned to the United States Food Administration for the purpose of alleviating a postwar famine in Eastern Europe. Departing on 1 February for the east coast of the U.S. via the Panama Canal, the ship reached Hampton Roads, Virginia on 5 March, before continuing on to Baltimore the same day to refuel. On 12 March, she sailed for the Adriatic via Gibraltar. Arriving at Trieste on 8 April, West Elcajon unloaded part of her cargo before transferring to Palermo to deliver the remainder. Having unloaded her cargo, West Elcajon departed for New York on 26 May, arriving on the 15th. On 26 May, she was decommissioned and returned to control of the U.S. Shipping Board. Merchant service West Elcajons mercantile career began inauspiciously when, not long after her decommission from the Navy, she was laid up with no work for almost five years on the mud flats at Benicia, California. With the postwar oversupply of shipping easing by the late 1920s, the ship was taken out of mothballs, reconditioned, and placed into merchant service with the American and Australian Orient Line, a subsidiary of Swayne and Hoyt, in late 1926 as SS West Elcajon.\\"News of Ships and Sailings at Pacific Ports\\", Los Angeles Times, November 13, 1926 (subscription required).

On one voyage from Los Angeles to China and Japan commencing in April 1927, for example, West Elcajon sailed with almost 8,000 tons of cargo including 70,000 cases of kerosene, 5,500 drums of gasoline, 700 tons of old newspapers and copper wire and general cargo.\\"Shipping and Los Angeles Harbor News\\", Los Angeles Times, April 7, 1927 (subscription required).

He enlisted in the United States Army for service during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and later was a Confederate Army general during the American Civil War. Following the war he returned to practicing law and later was murdered in a private feud in Tennessee. Early life and career Clanton was born in 1827 in Columbia County, Georgia,Wright, General Officers of the Confederate Army, p. 115. a son of Nathaniel Holt Clanton. In 1835 the family relocated to Macon County, Alabama, where Clanton was raised and educated. Later he attended the University of Alabama located in Tuscaloosa, but he did not graduate. Clanton chose instead to join the U.S. Army and participate in the war with Mexico. In 1846, Clanton first enlisted for six months as a private in the company of Capt. Rush Elmore, which belonged to Col. Bailie Peyton's regiment. When that term expired, Clanton joined the company of Capt. Preston Brooks of the Palmetto Regiment. Clanton and his regiment reached Mexico City following the September 1847 battle and after the occupation there had ended he returned home to Alabama. After the war, Clanton resumed studying law and in 1850 was admitted to Alabama's bar association, settling in Montgomery. Later, Clanton served in the state's legislature, and in 1860 he served as an elector on the U.S. Presidential ticket of John Bell and Edward Everett.Warner, Generals in Gray, p. 50 American Civil War service Although Clanton personally was opposed to secession, he chose to follow his home state and the Confederate cause in 1861. He first served along the Florida coast until the fall, when he was appointed a captain in the Alabama Cavalry on November 12. Soon after Clanton was given command of the 1st Alabama Cavalry regiment and was promoted to the rank of colonel on December 3.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 173; Warner, Generals in Gray, p. 50 Clanton's first major action was during the Battle of Shiloh on April 6-7, 1862, in which he was part of the leading Confederate units on the battle's first day. Clanton next fought in the battle near Farmington, Mississippi, on May 9, and then led a brigade during the Battle of Booneville on July 1, where he \\"drove the enemy from the field.\\" Sometime in 1862 Clanton resigned from the army, but was later reappointed a colonel in the Confederate service. His next assignment was as an aide-de-camp to Alabama governor John G. Shorter, and later in the same capacity to Gen. Braxton Bragg. During the spring of 1863 Clanton raised three additional regiments of infantry. Beginning that September he was given command of the 2nd Brigade in the Confederate Gulf District, holding this post into early 1864.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 173. 1864 Atlanta Campaign Clanton was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on November 16, 1863.Wright, General Officers of the Confederate Army, p. 115. Appointed from Alabama on November 18, 1863, to rank from November 16, and confirmed by the Confederate Congress on February 17, 1864. From February to June 1864 he served as aide-de-camp to Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk, and then he led the cavalry brigade of the North District in the Confederate Department of Alabama and Eastern Mississippi, a unit often styled as \\"Clanton's Cavalry Brigade.\\" Clanton fought during the 1864 Atlanta Campaign, notably in the engagement on July 14 at the Ten Island Ford of the Coosa River against Union Maj. Gen. Lovell H. Rousseau. In this battle Clanton reportedly \\"lost his entire staff\\" and \\"His bravery made him well known by the generals of the Army of Tennessee.\\" On September 23, 1864, Clanton's command was shifted to the District of Central Alabama in the Confederate Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana until that November. In January 1865 Clanton was appointed to command the Cavalry Brigade of the District of the Gulf within the same department. On March 25 he was badly wounded in the fighting at Bluff Springs in Florida. Clanton was hit in his abdomen and his back, and was captured there by Union soldiers. Clanton was paroled from Mobile, Alabama, on May 25 and allowed to go home to Alabama. Postbellum career and murder Following his release, Clanton applied for and was granted a pardon by the U.S. Government effective November 4, 1865. In 1866 he resumed his career as a lawyer, and also was very active in Democratic politics in his state. Nelson‚ÄìClanton shootout In September 1871, Clanton travelled to Knoxville, Tennessee, to represent the State of Alabama in a court case against the Chattanooga and Alabama Railroad. Clanton, aware of the strong Union sentiment in East Tennessee during the Civil War, felt he was entering hostile territory, and became convinced that the railroad company was going to try and assassinate him. On the afternoon of September 27, after the court had adjourned, one of the railroad company's attorneys, Tomlinson Fort (a friend of Clanton), took Clanton on a tour of Knoxville.Thomas Alexander, Thomas A. R. Nelson of East Tennessee (Nashville: Tennessee Historical Commission, 1956), pp. 152-166. As Clanton and Fort passed the Lamar House Hotel on Gay Street, they encountered attorney David M. Nelson (a son of prominent politician and judge Thomas A. R. Nelson), who had been drinking nearby in the St. Nicholas saloon. Their meeting grew hostile as Clanton suspected Nelson was insulting him, and he challenged Nelson to a duel, which Nelson accepted. Clanton drew a pistol and ordered Fort to step off space for the duel (which Fort refused to do, pointing out that Nelson was intoxicated), while Nelson ran back into the saloon and obtained a double-barreled shotgun. When Nelson reemerged, he fired two shots, one of which mortally wounded Clanton. Clanton fired one shot, which missed. Nelson was arrested and charged with murder. At his highly publicized trial in April 1873, Nelson's defense team argued that Nelson had acted in self-defense, and portrayed Clanton as belligerent and prone to violent outbursts. The trial concluded on April 30, and the jury deliberated for just five minutes before voting to acquit Nelson. Newspapers across Alabama railed against the acquittal, calling the trial a farce.

Meonwara means \\"People of the Meon\\" in Old English. Background The Anglo-Saxon settlements of south east Britain c. 572 AD During the period after the Roman occupation and before the Norman conquest, people of Germanic descent arrived in England. Bede recorded the event in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. He said that: It is likely that the Jutes initially inhabited Kent (Cantaware) and from there they occupied the Isle of Wight ( Wihtwara) and also possibly the area around Hastings in East Sussex(Haestingas). They also settled in what was to become Meonware. As well as Bede's description, there is other evidence of Jutish occupation. Droxford, in the Meon valley, was the site of a large Jutish cemetery. Also one of the local manors had the medieval custom of Gavelkind similar to that in Kent. Further there is placename evidence, linking Kent and Southern Hampshire. In 686, Bede tells us, that Jutish Hampshire extended to the western edge of the New Forest, however that seems to include another Jutish people, the Ytene, and it is not certain that these two territories formed a continuous coastal block. Account in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Double round barrow on Old Winchester Hill, looking down into the Meon Valley The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records a series of landings by Anglo Saxon settlers, during the years 449‚Äì514, in the area that became Meonwara. In the Anglo Saxon Chronicle the founders of Meonwara were a man named Port and his two sons Bieda and Maegla. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle version is regarded as legend rather than fact by most academics. Also the listed names may not be of Germanic origin, and Maegla appears to be a Brythonic word meaning \\"chief\\" or \\"prince\\" (i.e. cognate with Old British maglos, Welsh mael and the Breton given name Ma√´l). The West Saxons The origins of the Kingdom of Wessex are unclear. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle has a foundation story (regarded by most as legend) it describes how Cerdic and his son Cynric landed in southern Hampshire in 495, and settled the area that became occupied by the West Saxons. Historians however are sceptical of this version. Most academics believe that initially the West Saxon Royal House ruled over the Gewisse and their power base was in the upper Thames Valley. The missionary bishop Birinus established the episcopal see at Dorchester-on-Thames in the 630s. The history of the Gewisse is quite obscure before the arrival of Birinus, but there were probably several west Saxon groups located in the upper Thames Valley and Wiltshire. The Mercians The West Saxon's neighbours, to the north, were the Mercians. In the 7th century Mercian power was in the ascendent. This restricted the West Saxons ability to expand northwards and led them to concentrate on the lands beyond their southern borders. Wulfhere of Mercia advanced into southern Hampshire and the Isle of Wight in about 681. Shortly after he gave the Isle of Wight and Meonwara to √Üthelwealh of Sussex, possibly as a present after √Üthelwealh was baptised and married Eafe the daughter of Eanfrith, a ruler of the Christian Hwicce people. The alliance between the South Saxons and the Mercians and their control of southern England , put the West Saxons under pressure. West Saxon takeover  After Wulfhere's death Mercian power eventually declined followed by a time of relative peace. However, the united Gewisse, now known as the Kingdom of Wessex became resurgent under their King Caedwalla. Caedwalla, probably concerned at Mercian and South Saxon influence in Southern England, conquered the land of the South Saxons and took over the Jutish areas in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, in the late 680s. Bede describes how brutally Caedwalla suppressed the South Saxons and slaughtered the people of the Isle of Wight and replaced them with people from \\"his own province\\". Although quite young Caedwalla abdicated shortly after this campaign and in 689 went on pilgrimage to Rome to be baptised. He died about a week after his baptism, Bede says that he had received wounds during the fighting on the Isle of Wight, which may have led to his untimely death. The subsequent establishment of the very large trading settlement of Hamwic suggests that control over the Solent was a further factor motivating the conquest of the Jutish areas. With the takeover of Jutish lands by the West Saxons in Hampshire, the church of SS Peter and Paul, Winchester built by Cenwalh in 648, became the new episcopal see in the 660's. Other Settlers The settlement of Exton, on the west bank of the Meon, is named after the East Saxons, indicating some sort of settlement or other form of influence from that people. The first surviving record of the name is from 940 as East Seaxnatune.

The group placed two songs on the UK Singles Chart (1981's \\"Me and Mr. Sanchez\\", and 1982's \\"Klactoveesedstein\\"), but is perhaps better known in retrospect for launching the careers of several players who went on to form the sophisticated jazz/Latin/samba/pop group Matt Bianco. History Origin and early success (1981‚Äì1982) Blue Rondo √† la Turk was a floating collective of jazz and salsa oriented musicians, more-or-less led by singer/lyricist Chris Sullivan, whose stated goal for the band was \\"to bring back show biz\\". Sullivan co-wrote most of the band's original material; he also painted the distinctive cubist art that adorned most of the band's releases. For the earliest singles (1981's \\"Me and Mr. Sanchez\\", and 1982's \\"Klactoveesedstein\\"), the group was a six-piece: Sullivan, Christos Tolera (vocals), Mark Reilly (guitars), Mike Lloyd Bynoe a.k.a. \\"Choco Mick\\" (drums and timbales), Kito Poncioni (bass) and Geraldo D'Arbilly (percussion). All had assorted co-writing credits on the band's material, with Sullivan, Poncioni and Reilly being the most frequent contributors. Pete Wingfield produced \\"Me and Mr. Sanchez\\", which entered the UK Singles Chart on 14 November 1981, peaking at number 40. \\"Me and Mr. Sanchez\\" was also number one in Brazil for three months and was the theme tune for the 1982 World Cup. The band's follow-up single \\"Klactoveesedstein\\" was produced by Kevin Godley & Lol Creme, and entered the chart on 13 March 1982, reaching number 50. The group added Moses Mount Bassie (saxophone) as a member for their third single, \\"The Heavens Are Crying\\", written by the band with Clive Langer. This track was produced by Langer and Alan Winstanley, and failed to chart. The fourth single, recorded with the same line-up, was called \\"Carioca\\", and featured a co-writing credit for soon-to-be-official member Daniel White. Produced by Mike Chapman, this single also failed to chart. Blue Rondo √† la Turk's debut album, Chewing the Fat, was released in 1982 and included all four of their singles released to that time. Added to the line up for the album, officially swelling the group to a ten-piece, were Art Collins (saxophone), Tholo Peter Tsegona (trumpet), and Daniel White (keyboards). Chewing the Fat appeared on the UK Albums Chart, entering on 6 November 1982 and remaining on the chart for two weeks peaking at 80 on the second week. Line-up changes, second album, and dissolution (1983‚Äì1984) Following the release of the debut album and its minimal chart success, Blue Rondo √† la Turk fractured, with Reilly, Poncioni and White exiting to found the soon-to-be-chartbound group Matt Bianco. Collins, Tsegona, Mount Bassie and Bynoe also dropped out around this time, leaving the group a trio: vocalists Sullivan and Tolera, and percussonist D'Arbilly. The slimmed down group also slimmed down their name to simply Blue Rondo, and issued two non-charting singles: \\"Slipping Into Daylight\\" (1983), and \\"Masked Moods\\" (1984). Both were written by Sullivan with outside collaborators, and produced by Steve Brown. Both singles were included on the Blue Rondo album Bees Knees and Chicken Elbows, which was released in 1984 ‚Äî by which time the band had already broken up. Post-Blue Rondo activity *After leaving Blue Rondo, Mark Reilly and Danny White were both members of Matt Bianco, who had numerous hits on the UK charts in the mid-1980s. White later left Matt Bianco, and became a songwriter/producer for Basia, who also had chart success in the 1980s and 90s. *Kito Poncioni was also briefly a member of Matt Bianco, but left the group before they recorded their first album. He did however, co-write one of their hits, \\"Half A Minute\\". *During Blue Rondo's lifespan, Geraldo D'Arbilly also appeared as a session percussionist on albums by Madness and Fun Boy Three. Shortly after the group's final break up, he appeared on albums by Chas Jankel and the all- star charity single \\"Starvation/Tam Tam Pour L'Ethiopie\\". D'Arbilly subsequently moved to Brazil, where he works as a percussionist, producer and performer. *After the success of Matt Bianco, Virgin Records issued the 1986 compilation Too Soon To Come, credited to \\"Blue Rondo √† la Turk Featuring Mark Reilly & Danny White\\". The compilation featured all 6 Blue Rondo UK singles (even the ones that Reilly and/or White didn't play on), as well as assorted album tracks. The release was only made available on LP. * However, on 16 June 2014 a double-CD entitled \\"Chewing the Fat\\" was issued by Cherry Red Records, under number: CDBRED621 (ASIN: B00JVSIGJY). The two cds include 29 tracks, comprising all of the group's recordings on the original album plus various bonus tracks, 7\\" and 12\\" specials and some remixes. * Chris Sullivan ran London's Wag Club from 1982‚Äì2001, directed pop videos for the likes of Kevin Rowland, wrote for The Face and then became a staff writer and associate fashion editor for Loaded magazine. He subsequently became the Style Editor for GQ from 1997‚Äì2000 and went on to write features as a freelance for The Times, The Independent, The Telegraph, Guardian, Esquire and Italian Vogue. In 2001 he wrote the international best seller Punk and in 2012, We Can Be Heroes, which tells of the emergent New Romantic scene and the birth of clubland, as we now know it, in the UK. He also wrote the 9-part documentary series Gangs of Britain for The Crime and Investigation Channel and now has his own show on Soho Radio entitled Sullivan Suits and is the co-founder of Portobello radio.

Pacific Ports Annual, pp. 64-65. Note that Hurley's figure of 78 days for West Lianga differs from the company's own, which is 80 days. Assuming the company's figure is correct, West Hosokie would be the fastest-built ship of above 5,500 tons of the war. It may be however that Hurley's figure is for the date of completion of the ship while the company's is for the date of delivery. West Hosokie had a design deadweight tonnage of 8,800 tons and gross register tonnage of 5,600. She had an overall length of 423 feet 9 inches, a beam of 54 feet and a mean draft of 24 feet.\\"West Hosokie\\", Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Naval History and Heritage Command website. The ship was powered by a Curtis geared turbine,Silverstone, p. 169. driving a single screw propeller and delivering a speed of 11.5 knots. Service history U.S. Navy service, 1918-19 Upon delivery to the Navy on 29 August, West Hosokie was commissioned the same day for operation with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) as USS West Hosokie (ID-3695), Lt. Comdr. Charles A. Wilson, USNRF, in command. USS West Hosokie commenced her first voyage for the Navy on September 7, when she sailed for Arica, Chile to load a cargo of guano, which was duly delivered to New Orleans, Louisiana on 12 November‚Äîthe day after Armistice Day. On 20 November West Hosokie departed for Newport News, Virginia to load a cargo of Army supplies earmarked for delivery to the U.S. Army in France. She then proceeded to Baltimore to load some additional cargo before departing for France on 15 December. Unloading rail guns returned from France, March 1919. After arriving at Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France, West Hosokie unloaded her cargo and shipped an Army return cargo bound for Philadelphia, United States, departing 14 February 1919. Pausing briefly at the Azores for provisions and fuel, West Hosokie continued on to Philadelphia, where she arrived 10 March. After discharging her cargo, the ship departed for New York, where more Army supplies bound for France were loaded prior to her departure once again on 10 April. Arriving at St. Nazaire, West Hosokie discharged her cargo and loaded Army ordnance materials for the return journey to the U.S. Crossing the Atlantic once more, West Hosokie reached Newport News on 20 June. She was simultaneously decommissioned, struck from the Navy List and returned to control of the U.S. Shipping Board on 2 July 1919. Merchant service Following her Naval decommission, West Hosokie was placed into merchant service by the USSB as SS West Hosokie. Little is known about the ship's movements in the early 1920s, but she made a voyage from Antwerp, Belgium to New York in August 1920, suggesting she may have been engaged in transatlantic service.\\"Shipping and Mails\\", New York Times, August 26, 1920. On April 26, 1929, West Hosokie was purchased from the USSB by the Los Angeles Steamship Company (LASSCO), and placed into service as a coastal freighter on the west coast of the United States. Renamed SS Constance Chandler after the socialite daughter of LASSCOs founder, Harry Chandler, the ship would maintain a steady service well into the 1930s between west coast ports such as Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and Los Angeles, San Francisco and Balboa, California. She also made numerous voyages via the Panama Canal (where she sometimes ported at Col√≥n) to east coast destinations including Savannah, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida, Baltimore, Maryland and New York.Search results for \\"Constance Chandler\\" 1928-1934, news.google.com. See numerous \\"Shipping and Mail\\" type entries for the New York Times and Los Angeles Times. In 1930, LASSCO was taken over by the Matson Line, which maintained Constance Chandler on her existing routes. On 10 July 1932, about 50 miles off Cristobal, Panama, Constance Chandler caught fire in one of her cargo holds. The fire burned for 15 hours before being brought under control, after which the ship was towed 20 miles to port for repairs.\\"Plane Directs Ships to Rescue Of Vessel Afire Off Cristobal\\", New York Times, July 11, 1932 (subscription required).\\"Ship Fights Fire 15 Hours; Towed 20 Miles to Port\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, July 11, 1932 (subscription required).

After America's entry into World War II in December 1941, no more information about the ship's movements appears in contemporary newspaper records, presumably because of a news blackout, but one of the ship's last recorded journeys was a voyage from Hawaii to Australia in January 1941 to pick up a cargo of wool.\\"Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor\\", Los Angeles Times, January 14, 1941. Under Soviet Union flag On 13 January 1945, Liloa was sold to the Soviet Union, renamed SS Belorussia and commissioned to the Far East State Shipping Company.

Between the wars, she was placed into commercial service as SS West Gotomska. With America's entry into World War II in December 1941, West Gotomska participated in the convoy system that kept open the vital supply lines to Britain and the Soviet Union during the Battle of the Atlantic. In 1942, West Gotomska became one of the few survivors of the disastrous Convoy PQ 17 to Russia. In 1943, the ageing vessel was sold to Chilean interests, who renamed her SS Andalien.

Lt. Comdr. C. J. O'Brien, USNRF, was placed in command. USS West Gotomska commenced her first voyage for the Navy on 17 August when she sailed for Arica, Chile to load a cargo of guano bound for New Orleans, Louisiana. Making port at New Orleans on 11 October, the ship discharged her cargo of nitrates and then took aboard a full cargo of Army supplies earmarked for U.S. troops in France. Departing for France on 10 November‚Äîthe day before Armistice Day‚ÄîWest Gotomska arrived at Quiberon Bay, France on the 25th where she unloaded her cargo. She then took aboard 2,100 tons of Army return cargo and departed on 22 December for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving 6 January. Having unloaded her cargo at Norfolk, West Gotomska shipped 5,182 tons of fuel oil and sailed on the 25th for La Pallice, France. The ship then conducted a second run to La Pallice with Army cargo before returning, via the Azores and Philadelphia, to Hampton Roads, Virginia. She was decommissioned and struck from the Navy List on 6 June 1919. Interwar years Following her decommission, West Gotomska was returned to control of the USSB, which placed her into merchant service as SS West Gotomska. Through the 1920s, West Gotomska was employed in Transatlantic and Mediterranean service, operating between U.S. ports such as New York and Baltimore and various European and Near Eastern destinations including Marseilles, France; Manchester, England; Salonika, Greece and Oran, Algeria.Ellis Island Ship Database - West Gotomska, ellisislandrecords.org.\\"Continued from page 29\\", Baltimore magazine, March 1923, p. 30. There is no record in readily available sources of West Gotomskas movements in the 1930s, and it may be that, like many other ships in this period, she was laid up through lack of work due to the onset of the Great Depression in 1929-30. World War II In early 1941, at the height of the Battle of the Atlantic, the Irish government decided to establish its own neutral merchant marine. The government purchased three secondhand freighters for the purpose, Leda, a 4,100 ton vessel, and two ships owned by the U.S. Maritime Commission (the successor to the USSB), West Neris and West Gotomska. The two U.S. ships underwent a thorough recondition for the sale, and were slated for carrying a cargo of wheat gifted to Ireland by the U.S. government after an Irish crop failure.\\"Irish Flag To Fly From Vessel Here\\", New York Times, July 6, 1941 (subscription required). However, after Leda temporarily went missing on her maiden voyage under the Irish flag,\\"Anxiety is Felt for Irish Vessel\\", New York Times, August 31, 1941 (subscription required). the sale of West Gotomska appears to have been cancelled, as the ship remained under U.S. ownership. By early 1942, West Gotomska had become part of the North Atlantic convoy system, established to keep open the vital supply lanes between the United States and her wartime allies Britain and the Soviet Union. On 18 March 1942, West Gotomska sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia in Convoy SC-75 with a cargo of general goods bound for Liverpool, England, arriving at her destination 3 April. The next few voyages undertaken by the vessel would be made with the hazardous Russia-bound convoys.Arnold Hague Convoy Database. Click on the \\"Ship Search\\" link and enter West Gotomska for a list of wartime convoys in which the ship is known to have participated. Russian convoys On 26 March, West Gotomska departed Oban, Scotland with Convoy PQ-14, bound for Murmansk, Russia. After suffering ice damage en route however, she was diverted to Convoy QP 10, which was returning from Russia to Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. Arriving at Reykjav√≠k 21 April, West Gotomska put in for repairs. On June 27, West Gotomska set out from Reykjav√≠k bound for Russia once more, this time with Convoy PQ 17. On July 4, the convoy received an order from the British Admiralty to disperse, as German capital ships were thought to be on course to intercept. This order would have disastrous results, as the dispersed vessels became easy pickings for German U-boats and aircraft. Of the 33 ships in the convoy, only nine would make it through to their destination, the other 24 being lost to enemy action. West Gotomska was one of the lucky few to survive the voyage.\\"PQ 17: The Greatest Convoy Disaster\\", uboat.net. By November, West Gotomska was back in Britain, preparing for another voyage to Russia with Convoy JW-51A. The convoy departed Loch Ewe on 15 December, arriving at Kola Inlet, Russia on Christmas Day. With 10 passengers and a return cargo of timber, West Gotomska departed Kola Inlet for Loch Ewe with Convoy RA-53 on 1 March, arriving safely at Loch Ewe once again on the 14th. Return to the Americas On 24 March 1943, West Gotomska set out from Liverpool bound for New York City with Convoy ON-175. However, the ship straggled, and was diverted to Iceland instead, arriving on the 31st. On 19 April, West Gotomska joined a slower convoy, ONS-4, to complete the crossing, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 5 May, and from there making her way to Boston and New York. From New York, she proceeded on 11 June to Guantanamo, Cuba, arriving on the 18th. Diverted to Galveston via Key West, Florida in late June, she retraced the same route to arrive once more at Guantanamo in August. West Gotomska was subsequently chartered to Cia Sud Americana of Chile and renamed SS Andalien. Her movements after this point are unknown, but she remained under charter to the Chilean firm until 1947, and was scrapped by Northern Metals of Philadelphia in 1948.\\"Steel Shipbuilding Under the U.S. Shipping Board, 1917-1921\\", The Belgian Shiplover, No. 89, September‚ÄìOctober 1962, p. 479a.

She was commissioned the same day at the Puget Sound Navy Yard as USS Edenton (ID-3696), with Lieutenant Commander E. F. Kenney, USNRF, placed in command. Edenton began her one and only Navy mission on 11 December 1918, when she sailed for the east coast of the U.S. with a cargo of flour bound for Eastern Europe on a postwar famine relief mission. Arriving at New York on 27 January 1919, Edenton departed on 19 February for Trieste, Italy where her cargo was duly delivered. She then returned to the United States, arriving at New Orleans, Louisiana on 4 May. The ship was decommissioned a few days later on 12 May and returned to control of the U.S. Shipping Board. Interwar years Following her decommission, Edenton was placed into merchant service by the USSB as SS Edenton. The ship appears to have ranged far and wide during this period of her career. In the early 1920s, Edenton operated in both transatlantic and South American service, sailing between the United States and ports such as Rotterdam, the Netherlands and Havana, Cuba.The Ellis Island Ship Database ‚Äì Edenton, ellisisland.org.

The onset of the Great Depression in 1929‚Äì1930 substantially reduced international trade, and many mercantile vessels were laid up in this period due to lack of work. There is no record in readily available sources of Edentons movements in the later 1930s, which indicates that she may have been one of those ships laid up. World War II USAT Irvin L. Hunt stranded in the Makassar Strait in 1941. The ship was refloated and served through the end of the war. In February 1941, Edenton was acquired from the U.S. Maritime Commission by the War Department. Initially earmarked for Navy service and assigned the hull number AK-38, she was instead retained by the Army for use as a transport, and renamed USAT Irvin L. Hunt servicing the San Francisco‚ÄîHonolulu‚ÄîManila route. During July 1941 the ship ran aground in the Makassar Strait, Netherlands East Indies. The ship remained in Army service for the duration of the war, during which time she saw service in the Pacific Theater. After the war, Irvin L. Hunt was retained by the Army until January 1947, when she was returned to the Maritime Commission as SS Edenton and placed in the reserve fleet at Astoria, Oregon.

West Cresseys first and only voyage to Europe under Navy command began in January 1919 when the ship loaded a cargo of flour bound for Romania as part of a postwar famine relief mission. Sailing for the east coast of the U.S. on 12 January, West Cressey transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 2 February. Here the ship was delayed for a few days for alterations and repairs, until departing for the Mediterranean on the 12th. Calling at Gibraltar en route, West Cressey reached Constantinople, Turkey, on 10 March and discharged her cargo. She then loaded a large quantity of opium to be used for medicinal purposes along with a cargo of tobacco for the return journey to the U.S., departing 27 March. By 28 April West Cressey was back in New York City. On 13 May 1919, she was decommissioned and returned to control of the U.S. Shipping Board, thus ending her brief career with the Navy. Merchant service Following her decommission, West Cressey was placed into mercantile service by the USSB as SS West Cressey. Records of the ship's movements after this point are scarce. The vessel is known to have made a voyage from Rotterdam, the Netherlands to New York City in 1920 which indicates that she may have been engaged in regular transatlantic service.. She eventually was commercially operated by Page & Jones, Inc. (Mobile, Al.) Ellis Island Ship Database - West Cressey, ellisislandrecords.org. By 1927, the ship was operating for the Texas Oceanic Line, making a voyage in December of that year from Galveston, Texas to Liverpool, England.Item details BT 26/842/85, nationalarchives.gov.uk. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the scale of international trade fell sharply and many ships were mothballed in this period due to lack of work, West Cressey included. Laid up at New Orleans in the early 1930s, the USSB had ceased to maintain the vessel by 1933. Unlike many of her contemporaries however, West Cressey was to escape the scrap merchants' yard, and following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, steadily mounting losses of merchant ships to U-boats revived the demand for shipping tonnage. In order to help meet this demand, the successor to the USSB, the Maritime Commission, in addition to its orders for new tonnage, implemented a reconditioning program for older ships previously laid up. West Cressey became one of the ships so reconditioned, and in March 1941 she was placed back into service with the Grace Line for a monthly charter price of $16,486.\\"Lines Bid On Four Ships: Maritime Commission's Laid-Up Fleet Is Source Of Vessels\\", New York Times, February 25, 1941 (subscription required).\\"Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor\\", Los Angeles Times, March 2, 1941 (subscription required).

On 20 August 1941 the ship was purchased by the War Shipping Administration (WSA) and placed in service in Seattle, Washington operated by the American Mail Line acting as the WSA agent. From 19 May until 13 July 1942 the ship was operating under control of the United States Army in the Southwest Pacific Area without being assigned a local fleet X number. On 26 January 1943, West Cressey was transferred at San Francisco to the Soviet Union under lend-lease, and renamed SS Briansk I. Her activities are not known after this point, but in 1945 she was renamed SS Tallin. Tallin survived the war, but was stranded and lost off Cape Kamchatsky on 4 September 1946.Silverstone, p. 169.

Initially named Martha Washington, she was laid down for mercantile service as Nikkosan Maru, but following America's entry into the war, was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board and commissioned into the U.S. Navy as the supply ship USS Indiana. This name was also quickly dropped however, in favour of USS Western Front. Western Front completed several supply missions to France during the war. After decommissioning, she was placed into merchant service as SS Western Front. Less than two years later, the ship was lost in a maritime accident off Bishop Rock, United Kingdom. Construction and design Western Front was initially given the name Martha Washington by the builder, the Skinner & Eddy Corporation of Seattle, Washington, but was eventually laid down, on 25 May 1917 at the company's Plant No. 1,Pacific Ports Annual, pp. 64-65. as Nikkosan MaruGeneral Cargo Ships Built in Pacific Coast Shipyards , shipbuildinghistory.com. for the Japanese company Mitsui.McKellar, Requisitioned Steel Ships, Part II.\\"American Steamer Western Front in Flames in European Waters‚ÄîTake Off Crew\\", Spokane Daily Chronicle, 11 July 1921. On 3 August 1917, in an emergency wartime measure, the United States Shipping Board requisitioned all vessels of over 2,500 deadweight tons currently under construction in the United States, and Nikkosan Maru thus passed into the ownership of the U.S. government.Hurley, p. 39. The ship was launched on 15 September and completed 20 October, having spent a total of 150 days (122 working days) under construction. After completion, the vessel was renamed Indiana. Indiana had a design deadweight tonnage of 8,800, and a gross register tonnage of 5,742 tons. The ship had an overall length of 423 feet 9 inches, a beam of 54 feet and a draft of 24 feet 2 inches. She was powered by a Curtis geared turbineSilverstone, p. 167. driving a single screw propeller, delivering a service speed of about 11.5 knots. These specifications are identical to those of the later USSB Design 1013 standard, a design originating from the Skinner & Eddy Corporation itself, and it is likely that Indiana was similar if not identical to the 1013s later produced by the company. However, Indiana was never formally designated a Design 1013. For wartime service, the ship was fitted with one 4\\"/50 caliber and one 6-pounder gun. Service history U.S. Navy service, 1918-1919 Following her completion, Indiana steamed to the East Coast where she was inspected by the Navy on 16 September and acquired shortly thereafter. On 11 May 1918, the vessel was placed into commission for operation with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) as USS Indiana (ID 1787), but within a few days, her name was changed again, to USS Western Front. The ship would retain the name Western Front for the remainder of her brief career. Her first commander was Lt. Comdr. John Burns, USNRF.\\"Western Front\\", Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Naval History and Heritage Command website. Taking on board a cargo of steel rails, ordnance equipment, and ten locomotives, Western Front began her first passage to France on 17 May, but on the 23rd suffered a collision in convoy which sank the British cargo ship Clan Matheson. Western Front survived the collision, but was too badly damaged to continue the voyage and was forced to return to New York for temporary repairs. On 6 June she resumed the passage to France, arriving at St. Nazaire on the 22nd and discharging her cargo there. She then returned to New York, where she was drydocked at Robbins Drydock, Brooklyn, for more permanent repairs. Western Front subsequently made four more voyages carrying cargoes for NOTS to the French ports of Bordeaux, La Pallice, Quiberon, and Brest. On one run in the spring of 1919, she delivered 26 Army tanks to New York. Returning from the last of these voyages on 2 August 1919, Western Front was decommissioned on 15 August at Newport News, Virginia and returned to the Shipping Board on the same day. Loss in merchant service Western Front was subsequently placed into mercantile service as SS Western Front. Her career was not to last much longer however. On 23 June 1921, Western Front departed Jacksonville, Florida bound for London and Hamburg with a cargo of naval stores, rosin and turpentine. On 11 July, about 10 miles south of Bishop Rock, Isles of Scilly, a fire broke out which could not be contained and an explosion occurred.

Comdr. Lt. T. Ward, USNRF, in command. Laden with a cargo of flour, West Elcasco departed Seattle on 31 October, bound for the east coast. After stopping briefly at San Pedro, California, she transited the Panama Canal and arrived at New York on 2 December. With her cargo consigned to European food relief, she got underway for Europe on 8 December and arrived at Gibraltar on the last day of 1918. From the strait, she proceeded to the Adriatic Sea and arrived at Trieste, Italy on 11 January 1919. After discharging part of her cargo there, West Elcasco shifted to Gallipoli, on the Dardanelles, where she delivered the remainder of her cargo. She then took on a cargo of depth charges and headed home on 15 February. After her arrival at Philadelphia on 7 March, West Elcasco shifted to Boston and loaded a cargo of foodstuffs for France. She got underway on 8 April and delivered her cargo after arriving at Le Verdon-sur- Mer. Returning from Europe, via New York, to Boston on 9 June, West Elcasco was decommissioned on 14 June 1919 and transferred to the U.S. Shipping Board the same day. Mercantile service Little information is available regarding West Elcascos movements in the interwar period, but the ship is known to have been active from 1919 through the mid-1920s in transatlantic service, when the ship transported passengers and cargo from various ports in Spain, France and Italy to the United States. West Elcasco was sold in 1930 to the Mississippi Shipping Co. and homeported at New York. With the reduction in international trade brought about by the Great Depression however, West Elcasco like many other U.S. ships of the era was eventually laid up by the Shipping Board for lack of work. Army service With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, shipping losses caused by U-boats created an increased demand for tonnage. To help meet this demand, the U.S. Maritime Commission (successor to the Shipping Board), in addition to its orders for new tonnage, decided to recondition and return to service a number of old Shipping Board vessels laid up between the wars. In July 1940, it was announced that West Elcasco would be reconditioned and placed back into service along with nine other ships, including four more Skinner & Eddy-built ships, Eldena, Polybius and West Elcascos sister ships and , all of which had spent the latter part of the 1930s laid up at New Orleans.\\"10 More Ships End Lay-Up: Maritime Reconditioning Program Extended to 20\\", New York Times, 1940-07-09 (subscription required). In 1941, the United States Army Quartermaster Corps acquired West Elcasco and renamed her USAT Major General Henry Gibbins. In February 1942, Major General Henry Gibbins, along with the SS Florida, transported 850 troops and their weapons to the oil refinery port of Aruba, Netherlands Antilles, disembarking their cargoes on the 11th. Major General Henry Gibbins was fortunately still safely in port when German submarines attacked shipping in the area on the 16th.Burson, Ray H., \\"When Lago was Luck\\", lagocolony.com, citing from William H. Hochstuhl's German U-boat 156 Brought War to Aruba Feb. 16th, 1942, Aruba Scholarship Foundation, 2001. On 23 June 1942, Major General Henry Gibbins, sailing unescorted with a cargo of coffee, was attacked and sunk by U-158 about 375 miles west of Key West, Florida. The ship was hit on the port side by two torpedoes fired about twenty minutes apart, and sank shortly thereafter. The ship's crew of 47 along with her 21 army guards survived the attack, and were rescued within a day or two and taken to Pensacola, Florida.\\"Major General Henry Gibbins\\", uboat.net.

History Surul is a village adjacent to Visva-Bharati University, founded by Rabindranath Tagore. A major part of this central university, with the whole of its Sriniketan campus, stands within Surul Mouja. Surul consists of a large population of Bagdis, Bauris, Haris and Doms, as well as weavers. The Sarkar's who were Zamindars of this Birbhum District brought in Brahmins and other upper castes. The Sarkar family at Surul had contributed a vital role towards socio-economic development of the overall area and also towards establishment of Visva- Bharati, an Institution of National Importance.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, (in Bengali), part I, 1976 edition, pp. 304-308, Prakash Bhaban During British rule in India, this Surul used to be a very significant area, being the strategic centre of business/commerce/trade and was also the site of a commercial residency under John Cheap. After East India Company gave up its mercantile dealings in 1835, the residency was allowed to fall into decay.O‚ÄôMalley, L.S.S., ICS, Birbhum, Bengal District Gazetteers, p. 145, first published 1910, 1996 reprint, Government of West Bengal Geography Location Sriniketan now adjoins a part of Surul. It is from Santiniketan. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the area. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Physical features Surul is located in the south-eastern part of the district which is an alluvial plain between Ajay and Mayurakshi Rivers. It has hot and dry summers, spread over March - May, followed by the monsoon from June to September. 78 per cent of the rainfall occurs during this period.Choudhuri, Tapan, Unnayaner Alokey Birbhum, Paschim Banga , Birbhum Special Issue, February 2006, , pp. 60-61, Information & Cultural Department, Government of West Bengal.  Demographics  As per the 2011 Census of India, Surul had a total population of 12,160 of which 5,999 (49%) were males and 6,161 (51%) were females. Population below 6 years was 1,166. The total number of literates in Surul was 8,735 (79.45% of the population over 6 years). Infrastructure As per the District Census Handbook 2011, Surul covered an area of 8.1424 km2. There is a railway station at Bolpur 5 km away. Buses are available in the town. It has 11 km roads and open drains. The major source of protected water supply is from service reservoir and bore well pumping. There are 1,185 domestic electric connections. Amongst the medical facilities it has 1 hospital with 30 beds, 1 dispensary/ health centre, 1 nursing home and 25 medicine shops. Amongst the educational facilities it has are 4 primary schools, 1 middle school, 1 secondary school and 1 senior secondary school. Amongst the social, recreational and cultural facilities there is a working women's hostel. It has the branches of 2 nationalised banks, 1 private commercial bank and 1 cooperative bank. Education Surul Junior High School is a Bengali-medium institution established in 2009. It has arrangements for teaching from Class V to VIII. Terracotta decoration in Surul temple Culture As a result of the affluence and influence of Surul Rajbari, Sarkarbari, the overall area was rich in culture apart from being economically sound. The temples at Surul are well-protected and terracotta carvings thereon are distinct. A few of the temples were built in 1830, within a few years of John Cheap's death. Most of the temples are much older, dedicated to Shiva, one to Manasa and one pancharatna (five-towered) temple to Lakshmi-Janardan. Most of the carvings are traditional depictions such as the Ramayana war but the depictions of Europeans need special mention.(See the picture alongside). During the late 1940s Indian artist Mukul Dey extensively photo-documented the terracotta temples of Surul, which were subsequently published in an album titled Birbhum Terracottas, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, 1959. Durga Puja, Dharmaraj Puja, Kali Puja of Surul Sarkarbari still carries the tradition of the soil. The colossal buildings are still attracting visitors around the world and presently became favorite destination for film shootings. References External links * Little help matters. Intention counts.

Service history U.S. Navy service, 1918‚Äì1919 West Eldara was launched on 14 October 1918, and completed over the next few weeks. Delivered just too late to see service in the war, she was commissioned into the Navy on 23 November at the Puget Sound Navy Yard for operation with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) as USS West Eldara (ID-3704). Lt Comdr. John P. Tibbets, USNRF, was placed in command. West Eldara sailed on 8 December for San Francisco, California, entering the Mare Island Navy Yard six days later for repairs to her steering gear. Four days after Christmas, the ship got underway from the west coast, bound via the Panama Canal for New York City, where she arrived on 14 January 1919. With a cargo of flour and lard, West Eldara departed for Europe on the 24th. Upon her arrival at Gibraltar, the ship was routed on to the Near East, and on 12 February, headed for Constantinople, arriving on the 22nd. After discharging her cargo, West Eldara returned via Gibraltar to the United States, arriving at New York on 7 April. On 16 April the ship departed NY with a cargo of Army supplies destined for Antwerp and Plymouth, England. The vessel departed the British Isles on 12 May bound once more for New York, where she arrived on the 29th. On 4 June, West Eldara was decommissioned and returned the same day to the stewardship of the USSB. Merchant service In 1926, an arctic owl was found in West Eldaras icebox Following her decommission from the Navy, the USSB placed the vessel into merchant service as SS West Eldara. In May 1920, West Eldara ran aground off Honolulu while transporting a cargo of peanuts from Yokohama, Japan to Savannah, Georgia, as a result of which the peanuts were not delivered until March 1921. The Southern Cotton Oil Company subsequently sued the USSB for $198,000 for damages. The claim was dismissed in 1936.\\"Southern Cotton Oil Co. v United States et al\\", Find-A-Case Texas website. Through the mid-1920s, West Eldara seems to have been engaged mostly in transporting cargo and sometimes passengers between the United States and various European destinations. Repeat ports of call for the ship in this period included Bordeaux, Le Havre and Dunkirk, France; Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Liverpool, England. The ship also made several voyages to Seattle on the west coast of the U.S. and at least one voyage to the Philippines.Ellis Island Ship Database ‚Äì West Eldara, ellisislandrecords.org. In 1926, customs officials in the United States searching West Eldara for contraband made the unlikely discovery in the ship's icebox of an arctic owl.\\"Arctic Owl Found in Steamer Icebox\\", Hartford Courant, December 29, 1926 (subscription required). By 1928, the ship was sailing under the flag of the American Diamond Line (later known as the Black Diamond Line).\\"Peril Seen In Rival For Antwerp Runs\\", New York Times, July 30, 1939 (subscription required).

The accused pleaded self-defence and was later cleared by a Grand Jury.\\"Engineer Cleared of Killing a Seaman\\", New York Times, July 28, 1928. In 1933, West Eldara participated in two rescue missions at sea. In February, she was the first ship to come to the aid of the fishing trawler Newton, which had been gutted by a fire at sea off the coast of Boston. West Eldara stood by until a Coast Guard cutter, Mojave, arrived on the scene to tow the stricken vessel to safety. Most of Newtons crew of fourteen were rescued, but a search for two crew members who had earlier taken to one of the lifeboats was later called off.\\"Tragedy and Heroism on Fire Ravaged Trawler as She Is Towed into Port\\", The Citizen-Advertiser, February 13, 1933.\\"Two Men Perish As Fire Sweeps Boat Off Boston\\", Hartford Courant, February 13, 1933 (subscription required).\\"Fire At Sea Kills Two On Trawler\\", New York Times, February 13, 1933 (subscription required). The second incident occurred in November, when the British freighter Saxilby foundered off the coast of Ireland during a storm. West Eldara was one of five vessels which raced to the scene, but a search in stormy seas the following day failed to find any trace of Saxilbys 27 crew.\\"Liner Heads Rescues: Berengaria Races To Sinking Vessel\\", New York Times, November 16, 1933 (subscription required).\\"Ships Fail To Find Crew Of 27 In Gale\\", New York Times, 17 November 1933 (subscription required). In 1936, West Eldara was sold to A. H. Bull & Company, who renamed the ship SS Mae and homeported her in New York.West Eldara, ellisislandrecords.org.West Eldara, DANFS. Note that DANFS says the ship was sold to Bull & Co. in 1937 but this contradicts several other sources. The ship was still operating under that name when the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941. Loss After America's entry into the war, SS Mae continued to operate independently. On 17 September 1942, Mae was proceeding unescorted from Trinidad to Georgetown, British Guiana when at 06:25 she was struck by a torpedo from about 45 miles north of the Georgetown Beacon. The crew abandoned ship in three lifeboats over the next ten minutes, but Mae remained afloat so U-515 surfaced and sank the ship at 07:50 with 16 shells fired from a distance of 200 yards, killing one of the ship's crew in the process. The rest of the ship's personnel, including 32 officers and crew and nine gunners, were rescued six hours later by the Norwegian steamer S√∏rvangen and later transferred to the British steamer Gypsum King, who took the wounded by Motor Launch to Georgetown and landed the rest some time later.Allied Ships Hit by U-Boats ‚Äì Mae, uboat.net. A ship portrait of West Eldara was painted in 1924 by Victor Edouard Charles Adam (\\"V. Adam 1924\\") for the ship's then-master, William A. Reed. Her funnel is shown in the colors of the Cosmopolitan Shipping Company of Brooklyn, N.Y., which was at that time leasing her from the USSB.

Originally named War Flame, West Haven completed two supply voyages for the Navy during World War I, and two relief missions in the immediate postwar period before being decommissioned. Between the wars, West Haven was placed in commercial service as SS West Haven and operated for several different companies. In 1929 her name was changed to SS Marian Otis Chandler and in 1938 to SS Onomea. Following the outbreak of World War II, Onomea was acquired by the British Ministry of War Transport, renamed SS Empire Leopard and placed into convoy service on the North Atlantic, delivering vital supplies from the United States to Britain. In November 1942, while operating with Convoy SC-107, Empire Leopard was torpedoed and sunk by , commanded by U-boat ace Siegfried von Forstner. Construction and design West Haven was built as War Flame in Seattle, Washington in 1917 at Plant No. 1 of the Skinner & Eddy Corporation. A product of the United States Shipping Boards emergency wartime shipbuilding program, War Flame was laid down on 13 August 1917 and launched on 1 November 1917 in what was then apparently a new world keel-to-launch record of just 67 working days (81 calendar days).\\"55-Day Launching Breaks World Record\\", New York Times, 21 April 1918. Note that this article does not refer directly to West Haven, but the record referred to as set \\"five months previous\\" appears to refer to West Haven, as this was the only Skinner & Eddy ship to be launched in under 70 days on that approximate date (see Pacific Ports Annual pp. 64‚Äì65 for confirmation). The ship was completed an additional 43 working (54 calendar) days later on 24 December 1917‚Äîa keel-to-delivery time of 110 working days (135 calendar days), establishing a new company record.Pacific Ports Annual, pp. 64‚Äì65. When completed, War Flame had a deadweight tonnage of 8,480 tons (8,800 nominal) and a gross register tonnage of 5,520 tons (5,600 nominal). The ship had an overall length of 423 feet 9 inches, a beam of 54 feet and a draft of 24 feet 2 inches.Jordan, p. 404. Note that statistics for these ships may differ slightly depending on the reference. War Flame was powered by a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine supplied by the Puget Sound Machinery Depot of Seattle, with cylinders of 25, 42 and 72 inches respectively and a stroke of 48 inches,\\"Register of Ships Em-Ex\\", reach.ent. According to the website, the info about the engine was \\"transcribed from the Lloyd's Register of British and Foreign Shipping\\". which drove a single screw propeller and delivered a service speed of 11 knots. Service history U.S. Navy service, 1918‚Äì1919 After completion, War Flame was handed over on 24 December 1917 to the U.S. Navy, who named the ship West Haven. On 18 June 1918, the vessel was commissioned into service at New Orleans as USS West Haven (ID-2159) for operation with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), with Lt. William M. Tonken, USNRF, in command.\\"West Haven\\", Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Naval History and Heritage Command website. Laden with general Army supplies, West Haven departed New Orleans on 3 July and steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, where she joined a convoy sailing for Europe. She arrived at Bordeaux, France, on 12 August 1918 and unloaded her cargo over the ensuing days. Departing Bordeaux on the 21st, West Haven arrived at New York on 5 September. After shifting to Philadelphia the same day, the vessel there took on board 5,125 tons of general Army supplies before departing on 17 September and steaming to Norfolk, whence she got underway on 23 September in a convoy bound for France. After discharging her cargo at Brest, West Haven departed that French port on 3 November. While the vessel was steaming home, the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918 ending World War I. However, the return of peace did not change the ship's duties, as there remained the postwar task of reconstructing Europe which had been devastated by the war. Following a brief layover in New York, West Haven loaded 7,075 tons of general Army cargo at Baltimore and sailed on 5 December, bound for France. The ship made La Pallice on 2 January 1919, discharged her cargo over the ensuing days, picked up a return Army cargo, and sailed for Norfolk on the 26th. En route home, she ran low on fuel and was forced to reduce her speed to three and one-half knots. She finally reached Bermuda on 28 February. After topping up her bunkers, West Haven arrived at Norfolk on 4 March to load 673 tons of cargo for her fourth and final voyage for NOTS. Departing 28 March, she arrived at La Pallice on 12 April where she discharged her cargo. Moving on to Brest, West Haven loaded 2,306 tons of captured German ordnance, aviation supplies and 375 tons of steel rail ballast for the return journey. Departing for New York on 17 May, West Haven made an intermediate stop on 23 May at Ponta Delgada, Azores, probably to refuel, before continuing on to her destination.\\"Transport Brings In Ship Damaged By Fire\\", New York Times, 8 June 1919. Some days later, West Haven came across the stricken British steamer Beechleaf. The 10,000 ton cargo carrier had been in transit from Baton Rouge to Ireland with a cargo of fuel oil when her engines and steering gear were disabled by a fire which killed one crewman and severely burned another. West Haven took the disabled vessel in tow to Ambrose Light, arriving 7 June, before continuing on to New York where she berthed the following day. Soon after arriving at New York on 8 June, West Haven was placed in line for demobilization. She was accordingly decommissioned on 21 January 1920, simultaneously struck from the Navy List and returned to the USSB. Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Steamship service, early 1920s SS West Haven at sea, early 1920s After decommissioning from the Navy, West Haven was returned to the USSB and sold in 1920 to the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Steamship Corporation, which appears to have put the vessel into service as a coastal freighter, operating between the west and east coasts of the U.S.\\"Shipping and Mails\\", New York Times, 3 June 1920.\\"Arrivals and Clearances at World's Ports\\", Los Angeles Times, 1 April 1922 (subscription required). In November 1921, West Haven sailed from the east coast to Los Angeles with the unusual deck cargo of a fifty-ton Lawler racing yacht, Idalia, owned by C. B. Eyer of the Golden State Woolen Mills. At Los Angeles Harbor, the yacht was lifted from West Havens deck by slings suspended from shear legs at the docks of the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, after which West Haven was moved away and the yacht lowered into the water. Idalias arrival in this unusual manner was hailed as an innovation likely to give \\"great stimulus to the yachting spirit\\" of Los Angeles.\\"Yacht Brought On Ship: Pleasure Craft Carried on Deck to Local Harbor\\", Los Angeles Times, 18 November 1921 (subscription required). In September 1922, West Haven was repossessed by the USSB after the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Steamship Corporation went bankrupt.\\"Ship Board Drops Suit: Obtains Steamers Cape Romain and West Haven by Settlement\\", New York Times, 10 September 1922.\\"West Haven (ID 2159)\\", navsource.org. No further records of the ship's movements appear until 1929, indicating that the USSB may have laid the vessel up through the 1920s because of the postwar oversupply of shipping. LASSCO and Matson Line service, late 1920s‚Äì1930s In February 1929, West Haven was sold by the USSB to the Los Angeles Steamship Company (LASSCO), who at this time were in the process of expanding their line from four ships to ten.Drake, Waldo: \\"Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor\\", Los Angeles Times, 19 April 1929 (subscription required). LASSCO renamed the ship SS Marian Otis Chandler after the wife of LASSCOs founder, Harry Chandler, and placed the vessel into service once again as a coastal freighter. In a repeat performance of West Havens rescue of the stricken freighter Beechleaf in June 1919, Marian Otis Chandler participated in the rescue of another vessel on the high seas, the USSB freighter West Hardaway, in December 1929. After battling gales for three weeks in the North Atlantic, West Hardaway had run out of fuel and was drifting helpless when Marian Otis Chandler arrived on the scene to tow the vessel 500 miles to Halifax, Nova Scotia. West Hardaway, which had been on a voyage from Grangemouth, Scotland to Norfolk, Virginia, sustained some damage in the episode.\\"Tows Steamer 500 Miles: One Shipping Board Vessel Brings In Another Buffeted by Gales\\", New York Times, 28 December 1929. In June 1930, Marian Otis Chandler was placed into service between Los Angeles and Hawaii after the LASSCO liner City of Honolulu was badly damaged in a fire.Drake, Waldo: \\"Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor\\", Los Angeles Times, 2 June 1930 (subscription required). Marian Otis Chandler continued making runs to Hawaii until early 1931, when she resumed coastal service. Over the next few years she operated from Los Angeles to west coast ports such as Seattle and Aberdeen, Washington; Portland and St. Helens, Oregon; and to east coast ports including Richmond, Virginia and Philadelphia.Examples: \\"Other 6 ‚Äì No Title\\", Los Angeles Times, 1932-26-04; \\"Other 9 ‚Äì No Title\\", Los Angeles Times, 1932-11-25; \\"Other 6 ‚Äì No Title\\", Los Angeles Times, 1931-05-23; \\"Other 18 ‚Äì No Title\\", Los Angeles Times, 1931-02-11; Cave, Wayne B.: \\"Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor\\", Los Angeles Times, 1935-02-18; \\"Other 10 ‚Äì No Title\\", Los Angeles Times, 1931-02-12 (subscription required). By about 1934, Marian Otis Chandler appears to have been shifted back to making regular runs to Hawaii. In 1937, the Los Angeles Steamship Company was wound up and its assets sold to the parent company, the Matson Line. The Matson Line continued to operate Marian Otis Chandler in the Hawaiian trade into the late 1930s.Examples: \\"Other 4 ‚Äì No Title\\", Los Angeles Times, 1934-05-29; Drake, Waldo: \\"Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor\\", Los Angeles Times, 1935-03-23; Drake, Waldo: \\"Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor\\", Los Angeles Times, 1935-07-09; \\"Other 41 ‚Äì No Title\\", Los Angeles Times, 1936-06-04; \\"Other 40 ‚Äì No Title\\", Los Angeles Times, 1936-08-11; Drake, Waldo: \\"Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor\\", 1937-07-27 (subscription required). In 1938, Matson renamed the ship SS Onomea.Jordan, p. 404, see the entry for Onomea.West Haven, miramarshipindex.org.nz. World War II In 1940, Onomea was acquired by the British Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) in order to help alleviate the shipping shortage caused by losses to German U-Boats. Renamed SS Empire Leopard, the ship would spend the next two years in convoy service between the United States and Britain, during the Battle of the Atlantic. Between February 1941 and August 1942, Empire Leopard completed five round trips across the Atlantic, carrying vital supplies of steel, sulphur and other goods from the United States to the British industrial cities of Liverpool and Hull.Arnold Hague Convoy Database, convoyweb.org. Click \\"Ship Search\\" link and enter the name Empire Leopard. After crossing from Liverpool to the United States in February‚ÄìMarch 1941, Empire Leopard picked up a cargo of steel at Baltimore and joined Convoy HX-130 at Halifax, Nova Scotia bound for Liverpool and Hull, arriving at the latter destination in late June. Returning to Hampton Roads, Virginia in July, Empire Leopard loaded a cargo of sulphur and completed her second round trip to Britain with Convoy SC-50, arriving at Hull on 8 November. Empire Leopards third round trip was completed from New York with Convoy SC-67 in February 1942, this time with a cargo of general goods bound for the Tyne, England. The fourth was made from Philadelphia to Hull with Convoy SC-82 in April‚ÄìMay 1942 with a cargo of steel and general supplies. Empire Leopards fifth and final successful round trip between Britain and the United States was completed from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Hull in August 1942, sailing in Convoy SC-95 with a cargo of steel and general goods. Two ships in this latter convoy were sunk by U-boats during the crossing. Final voyages Following the discharge of her cargoes at Hull, Empire Leopard made her final voyage to North America via Methil and Loch Ewe, Scotland to Botwood, Newfoundland via St. John's in September‚ÄìOctober 1942. At Botwood, the ship took on a cargo of 7,410 tons of zinc concentrates and munitions and sailed for St. John's on 24 October, arriving 26 October. At St. John's, Empire Leopard joined another 44 merchant ships and a small number of escorts preparing to sail for Liverpool as Convoy SC-107. The convoy departed for Liverpool on 30 October. On 2 November 1942, Convoy SC-107 was intercepted by the German wolf pack Veilchen (\\"Violet\\"). U-boat ace Siegfried von Forstner commanding was the first to score a kill. At around 4:10 am, U-402 fired two torpedoes, sinking the cargo ships Dalcroy and Rinos. U-402 struck again a few hours later, firing two torpedoes at 8:03 am, one of which hit and sank Empire Antelope and the other hitting Empire Leopard, which caused the ship to explode. All the crew on board Empire Antelope were rescued, but of the 34 crew and seven gunners aboard Empire Leopard, only three crew members survived. The survivors from both vessels were picked up by the British rescue ship Stockport and transferred to Reykjav√≠k, arriving there on 8 November. Wolf pack Vielchen would sink more than a dozen ships from Convoy SC-107 (including, coincidentally, Hobbema, a sister ship of Empire Leopard) before being driven off by Liberator aircraft from No. 120 Squadron RAF a few days later.Allied Ships Hit by U-boats ‚Äì Empire Leopard, uboat.net.

Commissioned into the Navy just three months before the end of World War I, West Hobomac completed three voyages during the war, and made several more on the Navy's behalf in the immediate postwar period prior to decommission in 1919. Between the wars, the ship operated as the merchant vessel SS West Hobomac. With the outbreak of World War II, West Hobomac was acquired by French interests and renamed SS Ile de Batz. After the Fall of France in June 1940, Ile de Batz was seized by the British and placed into service under the British flag.

Comdr. Peter F. Johnson, USNRF, in command. After taking on a cargo of 7,928 tons of coal, West Hobomac departed Portland, Oregon on 26 August 1918, bound for Iquique, Chile. Arriving at her destination on 23 September, West Hobomac discharged her cargo and loaded 824 tons of nitrates bound for the United States. Returning north along the Pacific coast of South America, West Hobomac transited the Panama Canal and arrived at New York on 8 November, three days before the end of World War I, where she unloaded her cargo. While still berthed at New York, West Hobomac received repairs to her engine and steering gear, underwent alterations to her crew's quarters, and refueled. West Hobomac departed New York on 30 November, bound for France with a cargo of Army supplies, and arrived at Brest nine days before Christmas. Discharging her cargo, the vessel loaded 226 tons of Army return cargo and additional ballast, and on 18 January departed once more for New York. Arriving at her destination 6 February, the ship remained there for nearly two weeks, unloading and taking on board 6,392 tons of cargo for transport to the Netherlands. Reaching Rotterdam on 11 March, West Hobomac unloaded and departed that port, in ballast, on the 23rd, bound for the United States. At New York, she loaded 5,252 tons of foodstuffs and relief supplies and sailed on 23 April for Belgium, arriving at Antwerp on 12 May where she discharged her cargo. Departing for the United States on 16 May, West Hobomac arrived at Newport News, Virginia on 5 June. On 10 June, the ship was decommissioned, struck from the Navy List, and returned to control of the United States Shipping Board. Interwar years In the interwar period, the USSB placed West Hobomac into commercial service. Little information is available concerning the ship's movements in this period, but it is known that the vessel was active in trade between the United States and EuropeThe Ellis Island Ship Database ‚Äì West Hobomac, ellisislandrecords.org. as well as ports in the Mediterranean. In 1933, the ship was acquired by the Lykes Brothers-Ripley Steamship Company consortium (later known as the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company.

Interwar years Following her decommissioning, West Humhaw was quickly placed into merchant service by the USSB as SS West Humhaw. The vessel's movements in the interwar period are poorly documented, but it appears that the ship was initially placed into transatlantic service. The Ellis Island ship database records that West Humhaw made a number of voyages from 1919 through the early 1920s from various ports in Europe, such as Danzig, Poland; Hamburg, Germany; Plymouth and London, England; and Pauillac, France, to New York.Ellis Island Ship Database - West Humhaw, ellisislandrecords.org. West Humhaw was eventually turned over to the American-West African Line for operation between the U.S. and Africa. The date of the turnover is not available, but by 1924 West Humhaw was already operating between New York and African destinations such as Nigeria, Liberia, the Cape Verde and Canary Islands, and C√¥te d'Ivoire. After her turnover to the American-West African Line, the ship would remain under the control of this company for the rest of her career. World War II Following the outbreak of World War II, West Humhaw like most other U.S. merchant ships was fitted with some defensive armament, which in West Humhaws case included a 4-inch gun, two 20mm antiaircraft guns, and two .30 caliber machine guns. To man the weapons, a group of 16 U.S. Navy armed guards was provided.Allied Ships hit by U-boats - West Humhaw, uboat.net. With America's entry into the war in December 1941, West Humhaw soon found herself part of the Allied convoy system. In July‚ÄìAugust 1942, West Humhaw participated in convoys sailing from Trinidad to New York via Key West, Florida. In September, the ship returned in convoy to Trinidad via Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

U-161 fired four torpedoes, one of which hit and damaged the merchant ship Benalder and another of which struck West Humhaw. Once it became clear the vessel could not be saved, West Humhaws crew abandoned ship, which sank by the bows in about thirty minutes. Fortunately, no lives were lost in the attack, and the survivors were rescued after about 45 minutes by the Motor Launch HMS ML-281, which transferred them to Takoradi.

After unloading and undergoing general repairs at New York following her arrival on 4 April, West Lashaway was simultaneously decommissioned, struck from the Navy List and returned to control of the USSB on 12 April 1919. Merchant service Following her decommission, West Lashaway was placed in mercantile service by the USSB as SS West Lashaway. From 1919 through the mid-1920s West Lashaway was active in transatlantic service, carrying cargo between New York and various European ports such as Lisbon, Portugal; La Pallice, France; Valencia, Spain and Genoa, Naples, Palermo, Trieste and Fiume, Italy.Ellis Island Ship Database - West Lashaway, ellisislandrecords.org. By the early 1930s, West Lashaway had been chartered to the American-West African Line (Barber Steamship Lines), and would spend much of the decade plying the trade routes between U.S. ports such as Boston and New York and various African destinations such as Lagos, Nigeria; Accra, Ghana and the Belgian Congo. West Lashaway appears to have had quite an eventful history through this part of her career.

On April 5, 1941 the West Lashaway docked in Boston and a stowaway female Basenji dog was found half-starved in the cargo hold. She had survived a 21 day journey from Monrovia, Liberia with a stop at Freetown before docking in Boston. She was adopted by a local breeder and became one of the earliest founders of the Basenji breed in the United States. Sinking After the United States entered World War II in December 1941, West Lashaway continued to operate in the Africa trade. On the night of 30 August 1942, while returning to the United States from Matadi, Congo with nine civilian passengers and a cargo of 7,670 tons of tin, copper, cocoa beans and palm oil, West Lashaway was struck on the starboard side at around 2:30 pm by two torpedoes fired from . The ship sank very quickly‚Äîin two minutes or less‚Äîand consequently there was no time to launch any lifeboats. Fortunately, the vessel was also equipped with a number of prepared wooden rafts which floated free when the ship went down, allowing the survivors to board them.Whitbeck, Part 1. Survivors' ordeal Shortly after the sinking, U-66 surfaced and briefly opened fire with small arms, but soon departed, leaving a total of 42 survivors on four rafts from the ship's original complement of 56. The rafts stayed together for the first few days, but then two became separated and were never seen again. The remaining two, which had been lashed together, later decided to separate in hopes of increasing their chances of being found. One of these rafts contained 19 people, including the ship's captain, 11 crew, two armed guards, and five of the ship's original nine passengers including a missionary's wife, Mrs Bell, and her two children aged 13 and 11, and two children from another family. The captain and one of the armed guards died within the first few days, leaving a total of seventeen. The occupants of this raft initially assumed they would be rescued quickly, but two weeks went by until even with strict rationing they were running low on food and water. They were eventually sighted by aircraft and some supplies dropped. After nineteen days on the open sea, they were rescued by the destroyer , but not before the rescuers had fired 16 rounds at the raft in the mistaken impression it was a German submarine. After transfer to the Dutch merchant steamship Prins William Van Oranje, the survivors were landed at Barbados.Whitbeck, Part 2. One of the children, Robert Bell, would later write a book, In Peril on the Sea: A Personal Remembrance, about the ordeal. 25 days after the sinking of West Lashaway, the raft which had been cut loose washed up on the island of St. Vincent, with the body of Gunner's Mate 3/C Dalton Munn, and the sole survivor of this group, boatswain Elliott Gurnee.

Howard had only been 1-for-3 in field goal attempts prior to his game-winning kick. Playoffs With the loss, William & Mary finished the regular season 9‚Äì2 (6‚Äì2 CAA). When the FCS playoff bracket was announced, the #6 Tribe found out that they would be hosting the #15 Weber State Wildcats on November 28. In the first-ever meeting between the schools, William & Mary utilized a season-high four interceptions (two returned for touchdowns) to easily handle the Wildcats 38‚Äì0. In the second round, William & Mary traveled to Carbondale, Illinois to take on the #1 ranked Southern Illinois Salukis. The Salukis boasted an offense that averaged more than 400 yards per game and over 34 points per game. After trailing 3‚Äì0 at the end of the first quarter, William & Mary's defense (#1 in the nation for rushing, #3 overall) stymied Southern Illinois for the remainder of the game and the Tribe stunned the host 24‚Äì3. The victory marked head coach Jimmye Laycock's 200th career victory (all at W&M;), and also made him just the 13th FCS head coach to ever earn that many wins. It also helped the Tribe tie a single season school record of 11 wins which had been set back in 2004, the first and last time that they had reached the national semifinals. On December 11 at 8:00 p.m., #6 William & Mary versus #2 Villanova met once again at Villanova Stadium for a national semifinal face-off. The game was broadcast live on ESPN2, and either winner of this match-up was going to make their first-ever national championship appearance in football. The Wildcats (12‚Äì1‚Äì0) came back from a 10‚Äì0 halftime deficit to defeat the Tribe for the second time in that season, 14‚Äì13. Villanova would then move on to defeat the Montana Grizzlies, 23‚Äì21, in the national championship.

Following her recondition, West Maximus was transferred to management of the Moore-McMormack shipping line of Baltimore, and the vessel was still in service with that company when the United States entered the war in December 1941. World War II With America's entry into World War II in December 1941, West Maximus quickly became engaged in convoy duty. The ship participated in her first wartime convoy in mid-1942, when on 17 June she loaded a cargo of steel and general goods at Baltimore bound for Liverpool, England. From Boston the vessel proceeded in convoy to Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia, where on the 26th she departed in an escorted convoy for Liverpool, arriving at her destination 11 July. After unloading her cargo, the ship commenced the return to the U.S. on 19 July, but on 4 August the convoy in which she was sailing was dispersed and West Maximus proceeded alone to New York.Arnold Hague Convoy Database, convoyweb.org.uk.

With her cargo unloaded, West Maximus joined an escorted convoy for the return to New York, departing 26 September and arriving safely on 17 October. Rescue at sea From New York, West Maximus departed in an unescorted convoy to South America, arriving at Guantanamo, Cuba 19 November and Trinidad on the 24th. From this point, she proceeded on December 5 to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During this voyage, the captain of West Maximus, Otto Heitman, observed what he first feared might be an enemy submarine, but soon realized the object of his attention was an empty lifeboat. On further investigation, two more lifeboats were spotted, containing 41 survivors from the torpedoed British ship MV Teesbank. After rescuing the survivors,Infield, Chapter 6. Heitmann proceeded to the port of Rio, arriving December 22. Here, as a token of gratitude and a memento for the rescue, he was presented with a silver cigarette case by British members of the Rio community. Return to Atlantic service Departing Rio December 31, West Maximus returned to Trinidad and thence to Guantanamo, where she sailed in an unescorted convoy on 29 January for New York, arriving 4 February. At New York, West Maximus loaded a general cargo again bound for Liverpool. Leaving in an escorted convoy on 14 March, the ship reached her destination on 3 April 1943. Final voyage After unloading her cargo at Liverpool, West Maximus prepared to return to the United States in what would turn out to be her final voyage. On 21 April the ship joined Convoy ONS-5 for her return to the United States. A few days into the voyage, the convoy ran into a Force 10 gale and its speed was reduced to only three knots, allowing a wolf pack of 27 U-boats to gather for interception. The wolf pack attacked on the night of 4‚Äì5 May, and one of the first ships struck was West Maximus, hit by a torpedo from that blew off a large section of the ship's stern. The vessel remained afloat, but while her crew were waiting for rescue, U-264 fired two more torpedoes which struck the ship at 1.10 and 1.30 am respectively on 5 May, and West Maximus went down by the bows about ten minutes later. Six of the ship's complement of 62 were killed in the attack, including an officer, four crew members, and an armed guard. The survivors were rescued at 11am that morning by and evacuated to St. Johns, arriving 8 May.Allied Ships Hit by U-boats - West Maximus, uboat.net. Convoy ONS-5 would go on to lose a total of 12 ships to U-boat attack (one of which, coincidentally, was , a sister ship of West Maximus), but 13 U-boats were also damaged or destroyed in the battle. In spite of its heavy losses therefore, Convoy ONS-5 is considered to be the turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic, as U-boats from this point were to suffer increasingly heavy losses for steadily diminishing results.

The yard is notable for completing more ships for the United States war effort during World War I than any other American shipyard, and also for breaking world production speed records for individual ship construction. In total, the company built 75 ships‚Äî72 cargo ships and three oil tankers‚Äîfrom 1916 to 1920, including 32 completed for the Emergency Fleet Corporation during the war. The yard was closed in 1921 as a result of the severe postwar shipbuilding slump. Skinner & Eddy later became a shipping line operator, and appears to have been wound up in the early 1970s. Background The Skinner & Eddy Corporation was founded in January 1916 by two entrepreneurs, David E. \\"D.E.\\" Skinner and John W. Eddy, owners of the Port Blakely Mill Company since 1903.\\"A Brief History\\", Port Blakely Companies website. Shortly after its establishment, Skinner & Eddy Corp. began leasing the shipyard of the Seattle Construction & Drydock Company, located between Connecticut and Dearborn Sts., Seattle. Seattle Construction & Dry Dock was itself a successor to the Moran Brothers shipyard, which around the start of the 20th century had been one of America's largest shipyards, responsible for building Seattle's first battleship, , in 1906.\\"Pier 36 -- Seattle Waterfront\\", historylink.org. On April 6, 1917, 15 months after Skinner and Eddy Corp. began leasing the yard, the United States entered World War I. Skinner & Eddy responded to the news by purchasing an additional of Seattle waterfront property from the Seattle Dock Company and the Centennial Flouring Mill for $1,500,000 and $600,000 respectively, which they used to begin building a second shipyard, which became known as Plant No. 2. After securing lucrative contracts from the Emergency Fleet Corporation for the construction of merchant ships for the war effort, Skinner & Eddy was also able in June 1918 to make an outright purchase of the yard of Seattle Construction and Dry Dock, which was named Plant No. 1. Facilities When completed, Skinner & Eddy's facilities included ten building slipways‚Äîfive at each Plant‚Äîand four outfitting docks. A five- section, drydock capable of servicing vessels of up to 15,000 tons was also acquired, along with a 50-ton floating crane.Pacific Ports Annual, p. 405. Most of the ships built by the company during the war were constructed at Plant No. 1,Pacific Ports Annual, pp. 64-65. as Plant No. 2 was still under construction for much of this period. With its two plants, which together covered about of waterfront property, Skinner & Eddy was Seattle's largest shipbuilding company, at its wartime peak employing about 13,500 people. World War I Launch of the freighter Stolt Nielson from the Skinner & Eddy yard on 22 May 1917 The first seven ships built by Skinner & Eddy were for private contractors. The company completed its first ship, Niels Nielson, on November 9, 1916, and had completed a further two by the time the United States entered the war in April 1917. These three ships along with four partially completed vessels were then requisitioned for war service by the newly created United States Shipping Board (USSB). Thereafter, Skinner & Eddy was to build ships exclusively for the USSB, through the latter's agency, the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFT).\\"General Cargo Ships Built in Pacific Coast Shipyards\\" , shipbuildinghistory.com. Skinner & Eddy soon began to distinguish itself by its production speed. Prior to its operations, a cargo ship built and delivered in the United States in under 250 days was considered fast,Pacific Ports Annual, p. 402. but as early as June 1917, the company under the capable direction of its general manager, David Rodgers, completed a freighter, Stolt Nielson, in under 150 days. In November 1917, the company established a world keel-to-launch production speed record of under 70 days, maintaining and improving on the record over the following five months. In early 1918, another U.S. company briefly established a new world keel-to- launch record of 61 days, but Skinner & Eddy recaptured the record in April with the 55-day launch of West Lianga, a ship that was also completed in the record time of 80 days.\\"55-Day Launching Breaks World Record\\", New York Times, 21 April 1918. Thereafter, all the company's ships built during the war were each completed in well under 100 days, with a best performance by war's end of 79 days from keel laying to delivery. Good management alone was probably not entirely responsible for the company's outstanding performance however; Skinner & Eddy also paid its employees highly competitive wages, which enabled the company to attract the best and most skilled workers. The company's improved performance over time is also reflected in its total production figures. In 1917, the company produced a total tonnage of 72,800 tons; the following year it raised production more than threefold, to 232,400 tons. In all, Skinner & Eddy delivered 32 ships to the EFT, including 29 freighters and three tankers, over the course of the war‚Äîmore than that of any other shipyard in the country. Postwar history Since it was a widely held belief in the United States that a shipbuilding boom would follow the end of hostilities, the USSB declined to cancel many of its wartime shipbuilding contracts at the end of the war. In Skinner & Eddy's case, this meant that the company was to complete a further 43 ships for the USSB in the postwar period. In 1920 however, the USSB cancelled a contract for an additional 25 ships, prompting the company to launch a $17 million claim against the government for lost anticipated profits, later reduced to a $9 million claim.\\"Ex Parte in the Matter of Skinner & Eddy Corp., 265 U.S. 86 (1924)\\", justia.com. Skinner & Eddy delivered its last ship in February 1920, but failed to secure any further shipbuilding contracts after this date because of the severe postwar shipbuilding slump. In 1923, the Skinner & Eddy shipyard was permanently closed, and the company's proprietors, D.E. Skinner and John Eddy, dissolved their longstanding business partnership. John Eddy returned to the lumber business, and Skinner became sole proprietor of the Skinner & Eddy Corporation, which retained its original name. Skinner & Eddy now entered the shipping line business with the purchase of the Pacific Steamship Company, which operated from the company's former Plant No. 2. The company also invested heavily in Alaskan salmon canneries. In 1944, Skinner & Eddy bought the Alaska Steamship Company, and in the postwar period also operated a cruise line. D.E. Skinner's grandson, David E. \\"Ned\\" Skinner II, discontinued the business in 1971, moving the family assets into real estate. His Skinner Corporation would eventually become one of America's largest private companies.\\"Skinner, Ned (1920-1988) and Kayla (1919-2004)\\", historylink.org. The ships SS West Arrow, one of the first ships built by Skinner & Eddy. This ship was very similar in design to the USSB Design #1013 ships that would later be built by the company Skinner & Eddy produced a total of 75 ships from 1916 to 1920 (the yard no. sequence ends at 76 as the number 13 was skipped). Most of the ships were freighters, but three 10,000-ton tankers were amongst the seven ships built for private contractors prior to the U.S. entry into World War I. The company built three different types of standard freighters for the USSB, all of them of Skinner & Eddy's own design. The USSB designated these types as Design 1013, Design 1079 and Design 1105 respectively. The Design 1013 ships were 8,800 tons deadweight, with a length of 423 feet 9 inches (410 ft between perpendiculars), beam of and hold depth of Some examples of this type of ship were turbine powered and others were fitted with triple expansion engines. Some were also completed as oil fired and others as coal fired vessels. Skinner & Eddy built a total of 24 ships of this type.McKellar, Part I. Most of the ships completed by the company during the war were of this type. The Design 1079 was of 9,600 tons deadweight, turbine-powered and oil fired, with dimensions of 409.6 x 54.2 x . Skinner & Eddy was the only company which built this type.McKellar, Part V. A total of 23 were completed. The Design 1105 was also 9,600 tons deadweight, oil-fired and with triple expansion engines. Dimensions were 401.5 x 54.8 x . Again, Skinner & Eddy was the only company which produced this type. A total of 14 were built.McKellar, Part VI. Additionally, eleven 8,800 deadweight-ton freighters, similar if not identical to the Design 1013s were built prior to the manufacture of the USSB types listed above. All types had a typical service speed of between 11 and . In service , one of three Skinner & Eddy freighters converted into destroyer tenders Of the first 39 ships built by Skinner & Eddy during and shortly after World War I, 23 were immediately commissioned on completion into the U.S. Navy, and served briefly as supply ships before decommissioning in 1919. A further three were assigned Navy ID's but never commissioned. In 1921, three Skinner & Eddy ships (including one of those previously assigned a Navy ID) were converted into destroyer tenders and commissioned into the U.S. Navy as , and respectively. All three of these vessels would remain in Navy service through the end of World War II.See DANFS entries for individual ships. Only one Skinner & Eddy ship was lost (to enemy action) in World War I. In the interwar period, most of the company's vessels were engaged in commercial service. Three, , Elkton and Nile were lost to maritime accidents in the 1920s, and seven more were scrapped in the 1930s, probably because of the oversupply of shipping. World War II took a heavy toll of Allied merchant vessels, and of the 64 Skinner & Eddy ships that saw service in the war, 31, or almost 50%, were lost to enemy action, most of them to U-boats. Another two were deliberately sunk as breakwaters during the Normandy Campaign. The 31 that survived the war were mostly scrapped in the late 1940s and 1950s, and only four were still in existence by 1960. The last Skinner & Eddy vessel to see service was probably Edray, transferred to the Soviet Union under lend-lease during World War II and scrapped in 1967. Fate of the shipyards Following the closure of the Skinner & Eddy shipyards in 1923, the company's Plant No. 2 was sold in 1924 to the Pacific Steamshp Company, which built a new office and terminus on the site. The site also became the terminus of the Admiral Line, which did considerable trade with Siberia and the Orient. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the site became a Hooverville for Seattle's unemployed. During World War II, the Hooverville was razed to make way for a huge supply depot run by the Army Quartermaster Corps, and after the war it became a base for the U.S. Coast Guard. As of 2003, the site was the location for several large container shipping terminals. Skinner & Eddy's Plant No. 1, meanwhile, has become part of Seattle's SoDo district.

Once claimed by Spain then France who sold it to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Having just made the largest land purchase in the history of the nation, the government was eager to discover what $15,000,000 had bought. They sent out scouts, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, then Army Lieutenant Zebulon Pike to explore. Although neither group traveled in the area, their descriptions of the land and a growing fur trade encouraged adventurers to head west. In 1817, the US War Department sent Stephen Long, a Major in the Topographical Engineers, to explore the upper Mississippi. Following the North and South Platte Rivers, Long likely saw the St. Vrain Valley in July of 1820.‚ÄúRivers, Edens, Empires: Lewis & Clark and the Revealing of America.‚Äù Library of Congress. https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/lewisandclark/lewis-after.html accessed Sept. 11, 2020.

In 1848, gold was discovered in California bringing a wave of eager gold-seekers headed west. A few made their fortunes, but more often prospectors headed home with empty pockets or found work in the communities that had sprung up around the prospectors.‚ÄúCalifornia Gold Rush.‚Äù The History Channel https://westernmininghistory.com/articles/11/page1/ accessed Sept. 11, 2020. Some who left the goldfields found their fortune in land and sent word to their families. That sparked a new wave of immigrants moving west. The Oregon Trail passed by Fort Laramie, north of the St. Vrain Valley, and was a major route for the steady stream of immigrants moving from east to west. Historians estimate a combined 150,000 prospectors and immigrants traveled through Fort Laramie, north of the St Vrain Valley, between 1841 and 1853.Boyles, Berlyn L. ‚ÄúThe Massacre of the Hungate Family,‚Äù The St. Vrain Valley: Its early history (Longmont: StVrain Press, 1969), p.22. Native Americans watching these travelers had cause for concern; their way of life was in jeopardy. The immigrants did not understand the Native American tribes any more than the Native Americans understood them. Tensions rose. Although the government tried to address the issues through treaties, the government also broke those treaties. Bison hunters actively sought hides decimating the Native Americans' food supply while settlers were encroaching on what was supposed to be their land. The Native Americans' only recourse was to push the white men out. In 1858, gold was discovered near Denver. Another wave of adventurers set off seeking their fortune. Again a few were lucky, but far more became discouraged with the search and left the goldfields.‚ÄúThe Colorado Gold Rush.‚Äù Western Mining History https://westernmininghistory.com/articles/11/page1/ accessed Sept. 11, 2020. Many of them found land to their liking and made a home. Agriculture began to develop and cities were formed. Milo Smith, Perry L. Smith, and Elisha Duncan settled east of St. Vrain Creek and Boulder Creek on land that would one day become St. Vrain State Park.Patent #60842- Military Bounty Land Warrant in favor of Mary Jacobs, widow of David Jacobs assigned to Perry L.Smith;https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/ .

Life was good along the St. Vrain, but stories of trouble with Native Americas made the settlers wary. In June of 1864 the Hungate family, living northeast of Denver City, was murdered by a raiding tribe.Boyles, Berlyn L. ‚ÄúThe Massacre of the Hungate Family,‚Äù The St. Vrain Valley: Its early history (Longmont: StVrain Press, 1969), p.44.

The settlers felt they needed to protect themselves, so they formed the Home Guard with 4 officers and 58 volunteers. The government provided each man a six-shooter and a rifle, and they drilled twice monthly on Elisha Duncan‚Äôs homestead. Perry L. Smith donated a plot of land for a fort, and the community came together in July to build a sod fort.Boyles, Berlyn L. ‚ÄúThe Massacre of the Hungate Family,‚Äù The St. Vrain Valley: Its early history (Longmont: StVrain Press, 1969), 44. They cut the sod into strips one foot wide and two feet long and stacked them like bricks. The walls were two feet thick. The fort was 100 feet by 130 feet with portholes large enough to shoot through spaced every eight feet wide and eight feet high above the ground. There were sod benches two feet wide and three feet high lining the walls, so defenders could move along any wall in any direction to protect the fort from attack. Inside two structures were built in opposite corners to store supplies. Their roofs could be used as observation towers. They filled voids or gaps in the walls with mud and coated the walls from the bottom to the top both inside and out. Because it was close to where the St. Vrain and Boulder Creek join, it was called Fort Junction. In August of 1864, Elbridge Gerry made a historic ride along the South Platte to warn settlers of an impending attack. Two men were sent from the Platteville station to warn settlers along the lower Boulder and St. Vrain. Community members loaded their valuables into wagons and rushed to the fort, but no attack ever came. After a few days, everyone went back home.Sorenson, Paul, Firestone Historical Commissioner ‚ÄúFort Junction and the Lower Boulder and St. Vrain Home Guard‚Äù Aug 22, 2008. From February of 1866 to May of 1867, Fort Junction was used as a post office with Perry L. Smith appointed as postmaster.Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832-1971. NARA Microfilm Publication, M841, 145 rolls. Records of the Post Office Department, Record Group Number 28. Washington, D.C.: National Archives. Then in 1868 three other settlers were killed and the fort was used once again to protect settlers, but again there was no attack. After that, the fort was used as an occasional stopover place for travelers, and eventually, it was absorbed back into the prairie. The Chicago Colony Colorado came to the St. Vrain Valley in 1872 as one of only a few successful planned colonies in the Colorado Territory and was incorporated as Longmont in 1873.Encyclopedia Staff, \\"Chicago-Colorado Colony,\\" Colorado Encyclopedia, last modified July 31, 2020, https://coloradoencyclopedia.org/article/chicago- colorado-colony. Then in the late 1800s, a coal seam was discovered in the Carbon Valley, southeast of present-day St. Vrain State Park. The McKissick Mine was opened in 1887 and others followed drawing coal miners, not just from the United States, but also from Greece, France, Bulgaria, and Italy. Those miners settled in and around three distinct towns. Frederick is in the middle and incorporated first in 1907. It was followed by Dacono in 1908 to the south, and Firestone in 1908 to the north. These towns grew up around the mines and miners. Although the mines were all shut down by the 1970s, fossil fuels continue to be a big part of the area economy.‚ÄúHistory of Firestone.‚Äù History of Firestone Firestone, CO - Official Website, www.firestoneco.gov/281/History-of-Firestone; McKay, Brenda, and Sam Wallace.

Instead in 1962, the gravel ponds were turned over to the State Parks Department for a state recreation area. It was up to the Parks Department to turn the 50 acres of land and 80 acres of water into a recreation area named for Roy N. Barbour, an area resident and avid conservationist who was credited with helping to establish a chapter of the Izaak Walton League in Longmont.‚ÄúGravel Pit Renovated.‚Äù Colorado Transcript Golden Colorado Vol 102-No.85 July 16, 1968 From the Archives of the State Historical Society Denver, Colorado‚ÄúBarbour Ponds: Place to fish, boat state ecreation area‚Äù Longmont Daily Times Call 8 September 1977.

Game, Fish, and Parks improved existing roads, built new ones, and spent $6,529 to install four toilets, five shade shelters, picnic tables, and grills to prepare the area for visitors. Two of the ponds were reserved for carp. Others received species such as bluegill, sunfish, bass, and bullheads. Trout were not stocked because the water is too warm for their survival. Barbour Ponds drew visitors from the Denver area in search of fishing and seasonal duck hunting. In 1967 the area had 60,000 visitors. In 1968 the state allocated $55,000 to construct a 25 site campground with modern sanitary facilities, running water, turnouts and shade shelters, tables and grills. As visitation continued to grow the park service made more improvements. In 1975 the park roads remained closed a little later than usual as park personnel did some upgrades. When it opened in July of that year, it had received a facelift with significant improvements. There were 75 campsites, improved parking, and paving provided a better experience for visitors.‚ÄúBarbour Ponds Recreation Area Reopens‚Äù Longmont Daily Times Call July 1, 1975.

In 1994, the State Department of Transportation project to rebuild the I-25 Highway 119 intersection led to a resurgence of interest in Fort Junction. A ground-penetrating radar survey revealed possible ruins. Construction was halted and archeologists were called in, but the only artifacts found were a chair leg less than 20 years old. A historical marker commemorating the fort was moved from the northwest corner of the intersection to its current location near the Park-N-Ride on the southeast corner, and construction resumed. But interest in the old fort was sparked. Johnnie St. Vrain, a columnist for the Longmont Daily Times-Call, reported on the archeological activity and got three different possible locations for the Fort. The first reader said the fort was built about a mile west of the confluence of the rivers. That was supported by another who said according to a map of the Colorado Territory at the Library of Congress, the fort was just west of the confluence. That would mean it was somewhere between the current car dealership on the south side of Highway 119 and the confluence of the rivers. Another reader wrote in that area farmers had found remains, and it was just where the marker suggested about, ‚Äú200 yards due east,‚Äù of the original marker location, that would put the fort near the highway. Another person, who had been studying the fort for a long time and had a hand-drawn map from the time when the fort was used as a postal stop, believes the fort was built on land now owned by St. Vrain State Park. He used satellite imagery, but because the fort had been constructed of sod, there would be no foundation. He was looking for a raised area roughly 100 by 130 feet where the sod had been absorbed into the ground. He did find a promising area, but nothing definitive was ever found.  Recent history  The land was the beginning, but the plans would require almost $15 million over 10 years to develop new recreational opportunities at St. Vrain State Park.Smith, Jerd. ‚ÄúBig Boost For Land Preservation-55,000-Acre Parcel Ang Sites to Gain from GOCO Funds‚Äù Rocky Mountain News December 2, 2004 page 34A. The plan included adding five more ponds from pits dug by gravel companies and a network of trails that will help connect open lands, park areas, and trails from Longmont under I-25 into Weld County. They also planned to add campsites with both water and electric bringing the total number of campsites to 160. By 2004 a new entry station was built, water and electric were installed, and preliminary work was done for improvements through 2007.St. Vrain State Park, History of St.Vrain State Park: Based on Park Manager‚Äôs Reports and other Published Sources. In 2005 trees and bushes that would provide a buffer for and animal habitat were planted along the south and east boundaries of the park. These buffer zones would be irrigated using a ditch and playa concept. Forty-five new campsites were built with water, sewer and electricity. The road around Pelican Pond and the southern portion of the park were permanently closed to vehicular use. Americorp volunteers helped to plant 100 large cottonwoods in the new campground. Mallard pond was restored with new shoreline grading, rock fishing piers and native plantings along the shoreline. The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts joined to help plant a native garden at the new camper services building. Youth Corp helped with fencing and weed control. Americorp came back later in April with 600 volunteers for another session and planted 5000 trees and shrubs to finish the wildlife habitat buffer. In 2006 dry weather put all the new plantings at risk and kept park personnel in crisis mode watering everything to keep it alive until monsoon rains dropped 1.5 inches of water in July averting a plant die-off. In the fall Pelican Pond got shoreline grading and seeding. Two Boy Scouts working on their Eagle projects helped with plant restoration activities at Pelican Pond. St. Vrain State Park had been transformed from a ‚Äúlittle fishing park‚Äù to a restored riparian area earning praise from area newspapers. In May of 2015, Blue Heron Reservoir opened helping to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the park.‚ÄúBlue Heron Reservoir (Formerly Barbour Ponds) Grand Opening New 99.1 Country, accessed July 11, 2019, https://newcountry991.com/blue-heron- reservoir-formerly-barbour-ponds-grand-opening-this-weekend/. It is the largest Great Blue Heron rookery in the state. Visitors who came to celebrate the park's anniversary would have been able to walk nature trails around ten of the ponds, enjoy birdwatching, and photography. They could spend the night in up to date campsites, fish in stocked ponds, and enjoy views of Longs Peak.  Present day  Compared to when it was first seen by Stephen Long, St. Vrain State Park is much bigger and more natural, having been returned to a wetland area.

It is located between the Barangays of San Mariano and Dagupan in Lal-lo, Cagayan. The airport has been built to support the Cagayan Special Economic Zone in northern Cagayan, in tandem with Port Irene that will handle seaborne traffic. The airport is currently served by the charter airline Royal Air.  History  With an estimated total cost of P1.66 billion ($34.2 million), the 150-hectare airport hub is the result of a 50-year joint venture agreement between Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA) and Cagayan Land Property Development Corporation (CLPDC) with the private consortium contributing 58.3% in equity or P966 million while CEZA's share is 41.7% or P691 million. The airport was envisioned to be the international gateway in Northeast Luzon. Initially, it was constructed to serve the domestic flights to other airports in the country and international flights to Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and China. An aviation park and hangar hub was also envisioned for the airport where business and private jets can park. On June 23, 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) granted the airport new certification allowing it to handle aircraft with a capacity of up to 100 seats, up from only 29-seat capacity aircraft under the previous certification. The new certification has allowed the possibility of regular commercial flights to begin operation at the airport. At the time of the new certification, the airport has fielded around 168 flights ranging from tourism, diplomatic visits and emergency services. Meanwhile, the airport served its first two commercial flights with two planes from Macau landing in the airport in March 2018. Facilities The airport's major facilities are the control tower, passengers‚Äô lounge. It also has a runway measuring long by wide, following the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

In Europe, while mountain ranges presented challenges to transport, they could mostly be avoided. In North America, however, the Appalachian Mountains presented a barrier that could not be easily out-flanked. Initially, European settlers found gaps in the mountains, among them the Cumberland Gap and the Wilderness Road. Early roads Map showing the route of the National Road at its greatest completion in 1839, with historical state boundaries Native American trails were the first in Appalachia. One of the earliest used by Europeans was Nemacolin's Path, a trail between the Potomac and the Monongahela River, going from Cumberland, Maryland, to the mouth of Redstone Creek, where Brownsville, Pennsylvania is situated. The French and Indian War created a need for roads through Appalachia. In 1755, General Edward Braddock of the Coldstream Guards was sent to rout the French from Fort Duquesne along Nemacolin's Path. From Fort Cumberland, Braddock's army cut a military trail through the wilderness. This would become known as Braddock's Road. Another was a British military trail built in 1758 by General John Forbes of England from Chambersburg to Pittsburgh during the French and Indian War, later known as the Pittsburgh Road and the Conestoga Road. The first modern road to be built through Appalachia was the National Road starting at Cumberland, an early hub of Appalachia, generally following Braddock's Road, heading west first to Wheeling, Virginia. Other roads soon followed such as the Northwestern Turnpike and James River and Kanawha Turnpike. Water By 1772, George Washington had identified the Potomac and James rivers as the most promising locations for canals to be built to join with the western rivers. Washington proposed a canal to connect the Potomac River and the Ohio River and founded the Potowmack Company. In 1824, the holdings of the Potowmack Company were ceded to the Chesapeake and Ohio Company. Construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony on July 4, 1828 by President John Quincy Adams. It followed the course of the Potomac River to Cumberland, Maryland. Had it been completed it would have continued west from Cumberland along the Potomac River and then followed the Savage River, crossing the Eastern Continental Divide near present-day Deep Creek Lake, and eventually following the Youghiogheny River to navigable waters. The James River and Kanawha Canal was a project first proposed by Washington when he was a young man surveying the mountains of western Virginia. In 1785, the James River Company was formed, with George Washington as honorary president, to build locks around the falls at Richmond. By then, Washington was quite busy since he was elected president in 1789. The goal was to reach the Kanawha River at its head of navigation about east of what is today Charleston, West Virginia. The canal eventually extended west of Richmond to Buchanan, Virginia. By 1851 westward progress had stopped due to increasing competition from the railroads. Even today river systems provide transport through barge traffic on the Ohio River system. The Monongahela River is navigable its entire length, deep into the interior of West Virginia, with a series of lock/dams ensuring a depth. Rail The next major transportation leap for Appalachia was the railroad. The Baltimore and Ohio was the first to cross. It was finished to Piedmont, Virginia on July 21, 1851, Fairmont on June 22, 1852, and its terminus at Wheeling on January 1, 1853. In 1855 the Norfolk and Western Railway, under the direction of Frederick J. Kimball, began to push across Appalachia. Starting from Big Lick, the lines extended to the Pocahontas coalfields in western Virginia and West Virginia and on north to Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio. The Southern Railway linked Charleston, South Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee, crossing Appalachia in 1857 in the Asheville, North Carolina area, although rail expansion halted with the start of the Civil War. By 1867 the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway had reached the eastern edge of the mountains and was also reaching for the Ohio valley via the New River and Kanawha valleys of West Virginia. The West Virginia stretch of the C&O; was the site of the legendary competition between John Henry and a steam-powered machine; the competition is said to have taken place in a tunnel south of Talcott, West Virginia, near the Greenbrier River. In 1888, the C&O; built the Cincinnati Division, from Huntington, West Virginia, down the south bank of the Ohio River in Kentucky and across the river at Cincinnati, connecting with the \\"Big Four\\" and other midwestern railroads. Henry G. Davis started the West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway in 1880. In the ensuing years it opened a huge swathe of timber and coal territory in northern West Virginia to use. It started in Piedmont, West Virginia, and pushed west creating such towns as Elkins, Davis and Thomas. It pushed east to Cumberland, Maryland, where it connected with traffic from the C&O; Canal and the National Road. West from Elkins, Davis created the Coal & Coke Railway to Charleston, completing another crossing. These eventually formed the core of the Western Maryland Railway. The Western Maryland's Connellsville Extension was built west from Cumberland to Connellsville, Pennsylvania, beginning around 1906 and was completed in 1912. Today the crossing of the Eastern Continental Divide by the West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway is abandoned and is used as a Rails to Trails corridor. The other crossings are either part of CSX or the Norfolk Southern Railway and remain the only rail crossings of Appalachia. Cumberland still serves as a major rail hub for Appalachia where two main lines head west. Highways Auto trail sign pre-U.S. Highway system In 1880 the Good Roads Movement was formed. They knew outside of cities, roads were dirt or gravel, mud in the winter and dust in the summer. In its early years, the main goal of the movement was education for road building in rural areas between cities, such as Appalachia, to help rural populations gain the social and economic benefits enjoyed by cities where citizens benefitted from railroads, trolleys and paved streets. This eventually led to the auto trail system of highways. The first crossing Appalachia was the Lincoln Highway, which would later become US 30. This was closely followed by the Dixie Highway, first planned in 1914 to connect the US Midwest with the Southern United States, crossing Appalachia following what is now US 25. Other auto trails crossing Appalachia include the Jefferson Davis Highway, Lakes-to-Sea Highway, Lee Highway, and National Old Trails Highway. The next great leap in transportation was the creation of the U.S. Highway system in 1926, replacing the auto trails. The longest primary US highway contained in Appalachia is US 11 traversing the eastern side. US 21 was another primary US highway, but much of its route has been decommissioned and replaced with Interstate 77. These make/made up the north-south routes. East-west routes include US 30, US 33, US 40, US 50, US 60, and US 70. Many spur routes such as US 220 and US 119 serve various parts of Appalachia. Local transport conditions in Appalachia during the mid-twentieth century. Cattle rest on an unpaved mountain road in Breathitt County, Kentucky, 1940. Photo by Marion Post Wolcott. The Pennsylvania Turnpike was the first long-distance rural controlled-access highway in the United States and also the first one to cross Appalachia. It was known as the \\"tunnel highway\\" because of the seven mountain tunnels along its Appalachian route. On October 1, 1940 the first section of turnpike opened, running from US 11 near Carlisle (southwest of Harrisburg) west to US 30 at Irwin (east of Pittsburgh). Crossing was completed with the Western Extension, from Irwin to US 22 east of Pittsburgh, opened August 7, 1951. The remainder opened to traffic on December 26, 1951, taking the highway west almost to the Ohio state line. The Pennsylvania Turnpike remained the only superhighway crossing Appalachia until the interstate system that was authorized by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. Today seven Interstates cross Appalachia east to west, starting with Interstate 86, Interstate 80, Interstate 70, Interstate 64, Interstate 26, and Interstate 40. There are three Interstates crossing north to south: Interstate 75, Interstate 77 and Interstate 81. Interstate 26 in particular is undergoing an extension from Asheville, North Carolina to Kingsport, Tennessee. Among the projects associated with the extension is a future multi-million dollar bridge crossing the French Broad River in Asheville. Appalachian Development Highway System However, despite the fact that the region is crisscrossed by many U.S. and Interstate highways, those routes primarily serve cross-country traffic rather than the locals themselves. Towns closer to the major highways and nearer to the many larger cities fringing the region (Pittsburgh, Wheeling, Columbus, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., etc.) are disproportionately better-off than rural regions in the mountainous interior. Instead of being tied to the land, jobs in the towns tend to emphasize industry and services‚Äîimportant signs of a more diversified economy. Nonetheless, aside from the major urban centers along its perimeter, the entire Appalachian region still suffers from population decline and the loss of younger residents to the cities. To reverse decline and spur economic growth, Appalachian governors have prioritized the creation of a modern highway system accessible to local residents as the key to economic development. As a result, in 1965, the Appalachian Regional Commission created the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) which was the first highway system designed specifically to service Appalachia. The ADHS was designed to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the Interstate system, connect Appalachia to the interstate system, and provide access to areas within the region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation. The ADHS is currently authorized at , including added in January 2004. These routes are known as corridors. They are built to a higher standard than US Highways, but less than Interstate standard, although some such as Corridor E were built to be interstates. Recreation The creation in 1936 of the Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine, helped open the area to hikers and outdoor enthusiasts from all over the world.

Touted as Colorado's answer to Lake Powell, this reservoir on the San Juan River begins in Colorado's San Juan Mountains and extends into New Mexico. Its area is , and it has of shoreline in two states. Park activities include boating, houseboating, fishing, camping, and wildlife viewing. There is a New Mexico state park at the southern end of the lake.  History  The area where Navajo State Park now sits was originally inhabited by the Ancestral Puebloans who abandoned the area around 1050 A.D. because of a serious drought at that time. The Ute and Navajo tribes settled the area during the 14th century. The 10 explorers of the Dominguez‚ÄìEscalante Expedition were some of the first white men entering the area. Their mission was to create a route from New Mexico to California for the Spaniards. In the early 1880s, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad laid their tracks in the area. The railroad served the area until 1967 and was an important part of the economy. The Navajo Dam was constructed in 1962 to provide irrigation water for the Navajo Nation.  Ecology  Many migratory and resident birds are known in this area, including several species of raptors, pinyon jay, black-billed magpie, common raven, and waterfowl and shorebirds which are attracted to the reservoir. Mule deer are a common sight, as are cottontail rabbit, coyote, red fox, porcupine, striped skunk and ground squirrel. Rare wildlife species present include the river otter (which has been reintroduced to the Piedra River), the bald eagle, and the white pelican (a summer resident). Anglers are attracted by the warm- and cold-water fishing opportunities, which include largemouth and smallmouth bass, crappie, bluegill, catfish, northern pike, rainbow trout and kokanee salmon. Park uplands are dominated by pinyon-juniper woodland, sagebrush shrubland and western slope grassland communities. Short-statured pinyon pine and Utah juniper trees with an understory of shrubs and grasses comprise the pinyon- juniper woodland community, occupying dry slopes, hills and mesa tops. Common understory plant species include Gambel oak, big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, western wheatgrass, galleta and blue grama. The sagebrush shrubland community is dominated by big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Gambel oak and skunkbrush sumac. This shrub community occupies more mesic slopes and provides understory for the pinyon-juniper community. Western slope grasslands support the sod-forming blue grama, galleta and western wheatgrass, and the bunchgrasses Indian ricegrass, needle-and-thread grass and Junegrass. Wetland, riparian and aquatic plant communities have become established around the reservoir, in the San Juan and Piedra river valleys above the reservoir and on ground water seeps.  Geology  Navajo State Park features a 15,000 surface-acre reservoir formed in the San Juan River Valley of southwestern Colorado. The San Juan River is joined by the Piedra River near the northern park boundary. Uplands within the park are characterized by flat-topped mesas and gently rolling hills, occasionally cut by steep-sided canyons. The uplands are Tertiary sedimentary rocks deposited during Eocene times, which are represented by sandstones and conglomerates of the San Jose and Blanco Basin formations and Telluride Conglomerate. Quaternary surficial deposits are present along both rivers as alluvium, terrace gravels and alluvial fan deposits.

Music video The music video features a dream sequence of all four band members being chased by dozens of school uniformed students. The band runs up the stairs to the roof of a building and jump off the roof into a body of water, to which all the students follow. As they continue to run away in the water, everyone of the band members are tackled into the water one by one by the students. As Good is tackled, the video then cuts to Good sliding into a rain-soaked soccer field. As he gets up, he sees the students at the other side of the field taunting him. One student (the same one who tackled him) spits towards Good from the top of the group. Good runs towards them and jumps into the group of students and is quickly defeated, shown lying on the ground with his eyes closed. Good then wakes up in his bedroom and sees the girl who tackled him and spat at him in his dream staring at him. The camera then moves behind the girl, showing a large knife in her hand behind her back as the video cuts to black. Filming The music video was directed by Bill Morrison and produced by Paddy Gillen. The video was filmed over a three-day period in many popular locations in Vancouver, such as the Pacific Coliseum, the Pacific National Exhibition and the Vancouver Aquatic Centre. The video had the highest budget of any MGB music video, costing an estimated $150,000.

Established during the local gold mining boom, it is considered a ghost town. History Placer was unofficially established in 1885 as \\"Tom East\\" and platted in 1898 by pioneer landowner L. M. Browning, who had arrived in the area in 1870. Tom East was an early southwest Oregon miner, who came to the U.S. from England as a young man. He was mining in Josephine County by 1855, and at least three Tom East Creeks and one East Creek were named for him. In the 1870s, he prospected and mined along the Rogue River, eventually settling on Brushy Bar near the future site of the community of Marial, where he lived until his death in 1897. The first post office at this locale was applied for in 1893 by Newell Fillmore Inman with the name Tom East, but the Post Office Department changed the name to \\"Placer\\". Placer was named for the placer mines in the area. Placer post office ran from 1894 to 1924, with mail then going to Leland. Placer was established as a supply center for the Tom East and Upper Grave Creek mines and was on the stagecoach line between New Leland and the Greenback Mine. In its heyday, Placer had two large hotels, two large mercantiles and three saloons‚Äîthe only ones on Upper Grave Creek‚Äîas well as other small businesses, including a newspaper edited by Nellie Anderson. Placer grew rapidly with the development of the Columbia placer mine and the Greenback quartz mine, which was the richest mine in Oregon by feet of tunnel mined.

The Barack Obama \\"Joker\\" poster is a digitally manipulated image of former United States President Barack Obama, designed by Firas Alkhateeb in January 2009, that was adopted by some critics of the Obama administration and described as the most famous anti-Obama image. The image portrays Obama as comic book supervillain Joker, based on the portrayal by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight (2008). Alkhateeb has said the image was not intended to make a political statement. He uploaded the image to the photo-sharing website Flickr, from where it was downloaded by an unknown individual who added the caption \\"socialism\\". Described by The Guardian as the \\"American right's first successful use of street art\\", since April 2009, the poster was frequently used by anti-Obama protesters. Origin The first known use of Obama's image being \\"Jokerized\\" was published on Myspace by a user listed as Ross Brummet in August 2008. The image was of a smiling Barack Obama, his face painted over with Joker-style makeup, and the quote \\"The U.S. deserves a better class of war criminal, and I'm going to give it to them.\\"Brummet, Ross (August, 2008) Obama photo , (myspace.com) Retrieved December 25, 2012 A second instance, and the first to receive media coverage, occurred at a rally for Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden at Florida State University on November 2, 2008. Two members of the FSU College Republicans created the poster from an Obama \\"Hope\\" poster they had purchased from the school's College Democrats club, and used it to demonstrate outside the Biden event. This design featured the caption \\"Why So Socialist?\\", a parody of The Dark Knights \\"Why So Serious\\" tagline. The students dismissed criticism of the poster, explaining that it was simply a pop culture reference designed to \\"get the attention of a college audience\\". The version of the image that was eventually popularized was created by Alkhateeb, a 20-year-old Palestinian American history student at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He digitally manipulated the Obama photograph from the October 2006 Time magazine cover, using Adobe Photoshop. His version did not contain the \\"socialism\\" label. Alkhateeb was influenced by artist Shepard Fairey, designer of the Obama \\"Hope\\" poster, and wanted to practice a \\"Jokerize\\" technique he learned in class. He digitally added the Joker face paint over the Obama image and uploaded it to Flickr on January 18, 2009. Alkhateeb is said to have had no ill-will towards Obama, but was simply bored. Reaction Media coverage The image went largely unnoticed until an unknown person began placing posters of the image, with the added label \\"socialism,\\" throughout downtown Los Angeles, California. In April 2009, Bedlam magazine became the first media outlet to report on Obama \\"Joker\\" signs being spotted in Los Angeles. During the summer months, Obama \\"Joker\\" posters were distributed in Florida and Atlanta, Georgia. In August 2009, the posters became a viral phenomenon online. The poster quickly became the center of an international \\"media typhoon\\" widely covered by news outlets such as CNN, Fox News, and the Drudge Report. Media coverage ranged from praise for the image's artistic value to critics labeling the poster racist. Culture critic Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post described the poster as a \\"subtly coded, highly effective racial and political argument\\". Thomas Lifson, editor of The American Thinker, described it as \\"open mockery of Barack Obama, as disillusionment sets in with the man\\", and The First Post suggested the image marked \\"a turning of the tide of public opinion against a president who promised so much\\". Film critic Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the poster as \\"the single most chilling‚Äîand brilliant‚Äîpiece of poisonous political propaganda I think I have ever seen.\\" Copyright and free speech controversy The media coverage resulted in Flickr removing all copies of the image, citing a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice, and deleting forum threads discussing the image. The takedown was met with much backlash from the Flickr community and caused Flickr to change their DMCA takedown policy. The new policy provides for a page to remain if a takedown notice is filed against it, but for the image to be replaced with one that reads: \\"This image has been removed due to a claim of copyright infringement.\\" A spokesperson for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group, defended Alkhateeb's image citing fair use protection. As a result of Flickr removing the Obama \\"Joker\\" image, some online communities viewed Alkhateeb as the most visible representative, in August 2009, of free speech on the Internet. Protest symbol The image was adopted by some of Obama's critics and used for posters, T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other merchandise. The image is considered by some a symbol of the Tea Party protest movement. During the September 12, 2009, Taxpayer March on Washington, the largest demonstration against the Obama Administration's policies to date, protesters denouncing deficit spending and the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, dubbed \\"Obamacare\\" by critics, carried Obama \\"Joker\\" signs captioned . Criticism Some Democrats have called the image racist, suggesting a similarity to blackface makeup that was used during minstrel show performances. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, said, \\"Depicting the president as demonic and a socialist goes beyond political spoofery. It is mean-spirited and dangerous. We have issued a public challenge to the person or group that put up the poster to come forth and publicly tell why they have used this offensive depiction to ridicule President Obama.\\" Ray Tampa, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter in St. Petersburg, Florida, had a differing opinion: \\"I see it as the Joker, and being that I see it as the Joker I will have to say that it's fair game\\". Alkhateeb, in response to the usage of his image, said, \\"To accuse [Obama] of being a socialist is really ... immature. First of all, who said being a socialist is evil?\\" He also stated \\"socialism is an idea thats time has come and passed. It‚Äôs basically like calling someone a loyalist to the British crown\\".

His broad ranging body of work embraces the full gamut of the performing and visual arts and includes film, theatre, musicals, large scale shows, World Expos, dance, music, and architectural design. Glen Goei was the Artistic Director of Mu-Lan Arts in London from 1990 to 1998. It was the first Asian theatre company to be established in the United Kingdom. He is currently the Associate Artistic Director of the Singaporean theatre company, W!LD RICE. Goei's film Forever Fever was the first Singapore film to achieve a worldwide commercial release. The film was distributed in America and the UK by Miramax, which then signed him on an exclusive three-picture deal. In 1994, he received the National Youth Award for his contribution to the arts from Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. Early life Born in 22 December 1962 and the youngest of seven children, Goei attended the Anglo Chinese School in Singapore from 1969 to 1980, then Jesus College, Cambridge University, in the UK from 1983 to 1986, where he earned his B.A. Honors, M.A. in History. He spent the next two years at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, receiving a Postgraduate Diploma in Drama, and later studied Filmmaking at New York University (1994-1995). Career Goei's professional career started with his Olivier Award-nominated performance in the title role of M. Butterfly opposite Anthony Hopkins in London's West End. It grew through his multi-award-winning tenure as Producer and Artistic Director of Mu-Lan Arts in London - the first Asian theatre company to be established in the United Kingdom. Mu-Lan's productions, like The Magic Fundoshi, garnered acclaim in London, Singapore and worldwide - including awards for Best Original Play, Best Production and Best Comedy at the Sunday Times Fringe Awards. In 1998, Goei's film career began with his first feature Forever Fever (a.k.a. That's The Way I Like It), which he wrote, produced and directed. The film was produced under his production company, TigerTiger Productions. It was the first Singapore film to achieve a worldwide commercial release after being picked up by Miramax for distribution in America and the UK. Following its success, Miramax signed him on an exclusive three-picture deal. His second film The Blue Mansion had its commercial release in October 2009. It was shown at the Pusan and the Tokyo International Film Festivals. Filmed at the historic Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion in Penang, the murder-mystery revolves around a wealthy man who dies suddenly and returns as a ghost to uncover the circumstances surrounding his death. In 2013, Goei announced that acclaimed cinematographer Christopher Doyle will be shooting his third film, Yellow Flowers, a.k.a. The Hangman‚Äôs Breakfast. Written by playwright Haresh Sharma, the film touches upon Singapore's death penalty, telling the story of a single mother Eleanor on death row for unknowingly smuggling drugs, her rebellious only child who refuses to visit her, Eleanor‚Äôs young lawyer Nadya who also has issues with her own mother, and the prison‚Äôs reluctant executioner Gopal, who develops a friendship with Eleanor. In 2014, Goei wrote his first book for children, Little Red in the Hood, which transplanted the traditional fairy tale to a Singapore setting. Published by Epigram Books, the children's picture book was illustrated by Drewscape, and a part of its proceeds went to charity. In 2015, Goei's film project, Revenge of the Pontianak, was selected to be one of the 10 films to be part of the Berlinale Talent Project Market at the Berlin International Film Festival. Revenge of the Pontianak pays homage to the popular Malay horror films produced by the Shaw and Cathay studios in Singapore back in the 1950s and is produced by Tan Bee Thiam. Filming began in Malaysia in 2018, with Gavin Yap joining the production as co-director. Revenge of the Pontianak is set to have its theatrical release in August 2019. Underpinning Goei's work in film has been his constant and substantial contribution to Singapore theatre, principally as Associate Artistic Director of the acclaimed Singapore company, W!LD RICE and frequent director for the most commercially successful company, Dream Academy. His productions for W!LD RICE have included hits such as Boeing Boeing, The Magic Fundoshi, Blithe Spirit, Emily of Emerald Hill, La Cage aux Folles and his internationally lauded interpretation of The Importance of Being Earnest. Goei's work with Dream Academy includes the hugely popular The Revenge of The Dim Sum Dollies, Dim Sum Dollies - The History of Singapore Part 1 and 2, The Little Shop of Horrors and Into The Woods.  Personal Life  Goei is openly gay. He lives in Singapore with his partner and is an advocate for LGBT+ rights. He is a key figure behind the Ready4Repeal campaign, a petition urging the Government of Singapore to repeal Section 377A of the Penal Code, which criminalises sex between mutually consenting adult men.

In his Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema, Jasper Sharp uses Female Cats as an example of the range of themes possible in the Roman Porno genre, calling it an Argento-esque thriller. In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, the Weissers compliment Yamashiro's direction as the best thing about the film. They write that he, \\"goes the extra mile to compose many astonishingly good-looking sequences, punctuated by some creatively stylish camerawork.\\" A lesbian shower sequence between Mineko and Sachiko is singled out for praise.

He resigned from the post following allegations of corruption and subsequent removal proceedings.  Childhood and education  P.D Dinakaran was born in a Dalit Christian family at Arakkonam, North Arcot (now Vellore District). He did his schooling and then attended the Madras Christian College, Chennai and studied chemistry. He obtained his Masters in Political Science and Public Administration and Bachelor of Law Degree from Madras Law College. Career He started his career in Madras High Court. He also practised in the State and Central Administrative Tribunals at Madras. He served as Legal Adviser and Standing Counsel for Pondicherry University and for several State owned Corporations, such as Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC), Tamil Nadu Sugar Corporation, Tamil Nadu Sugar Federation Limited, Tamil Nadu Co-operative Milk Producers Federation (Aavin). He was also standing counsel for various religious institutions, such as Churches of South India, Madras Diocese and Coimbatore Diocese and Sri Subramania Swami Temple, Tiruttani and for several Local Bodies, Educational Institutions, Teacher's Federations, Agriculturists Associations, Marketing Societies and Social Organisations. On 28 August 2009, the Supreme Court of India announced that Dinakaran would be elevated to a Supreme Court Judge, but this was halted due to allegations of corruption and surrounding controversy. Dinakaran subsequently refused to go on leave when asked by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan and was transferred to the Sikkim High Court. On 29 July 2011 he resigned from the post of Sikkim High Court Chief Justice. He was facing impeachment allegedly on the charges of corruption and judicial misconduct. Controversies In September 2009, allegations were made against Dinakaran by several members of the Bar Council of India including Former Union Law Minister Ram Jethmalani stating that he had huge assets and land acquisitions in his Hometown Arakkonam more than what was fixed by the Tamil Nadu Land reforms. The lawyers requested Chief Justice of India and Union Law Minister not to appoint Dinakaran as Supreme Court Judge and initiate an enquiry process regarding the allegation. The members wrote a letter to President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union Law Minister to intervene in this matter. Justice Dinakaran had not been performing any judicial functions since December 2009 when the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha admitted a motion seeking his removal on charges of corruption and abuse of his judicial office. The Supreme Court collegium headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan had decided to replace Justice Dinakaran with Uttarakhand High Court Chief Justice JS Khehar, and recommended transfer of Dinakaran to the Sikkim High Court. Later, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh questioned about the desirability of shifting Chief Justices. The Law Ministry returned the file to the collegium for consideration afresh. As a result, the collegium, headed by the then incumbent Chief Justice of India, S.H. Kapadia, met and reconsidered the whole issue and stuck to the earlier decision to shift the Chief Justices. The Sikkim Bar Association opposed the transfer of Dinakaran to the Sikkim High Court and asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the proposal, (which requires approval from Indian President Pratibha Patil). The Sikkim Bar Association president D R Thapa had asked \\"How come the person be fit to be discharge judicial duties in one state if he has not been found worthy of doing the same in another state?\\" Impeachment proceedings and resignation Facing impeachment on charges of corruption and judicial misconduct, he resigned from the post of Sikkim high court Chief Justice on 29 July 2011 expressing \\"lack of faith and confidence\\" in the three-member inquiry Committee probing charges against him. \\"Before demitting office, I must confess with a very heavy heart that in spite of my constitutional position, I have been denied fair opportunity to defend myself and my reputation by the Judges Inquiry Committee,\\" he said in a two-page letter of resignation sent to President Pratibha Patil. Justice Dinakaran, a Dalit, also said he had a \\"sneaking suspicion\\" that his \\"misfortune\\" was because of the circumstances of his birth in the socially oppressed and underprivileged section of the society. This opinion of his at the time of resignation is surprising to say the least because of following facts: # At first, Supreme Court of India had decided to elevate him as a Judge of the Supreme Court of India. # Then cases of misconduct and corruption were alleged against him by Chennai-based Forum for Judicial Accountability, in September 2009. These allegations were confirmed by the Tiruvallur Collector in two reports. Only after this, the Supreme Court of India collegium dropped Justice Dinakaran's name for elevation. # Thereafter on a complaint from 76 members of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha chairman admitted a motion for the removal of Justice Dinakaran. # After that, Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari had in January 2010 constituted the three-member panel comprising Supreme Court Justice Aftab Alam (judge), Karnataka High Court Chief Justice J S Khehar and senior advocate P P Rao to examine the 12 charges framed in the notice of motion adopted by the House. # Supreme Court of India bench headed by a very senior judge, Justice GS Singhvi permitted Dinakaran's plea seeking Rao's removal just on the ground that Rao was biased against him. However, the same bench refused to quash the charges framed by three-member panel saying \\"They are legally trained minds who can detect the fabricated material. In fact, it (three-member panel) would offer protection to a judge also from baseless allegations,\\" Mysteriously, on 4 August 2011, Justice Dinakaran had a \\"change of heart\\" and wrote to the law ministry seeking to withdraw his resignation. But the ministry rejected his request. However, his pre-emptive resignation did manage to scuttle the probe against him as the chairman of Rajya Sabha, Hamid Ansari, quietly buried the inquiry committee citing Dinakaran's resignation in July.  Post retirement benefits  On 15 January 2012, it became public through an RTI query that Justice Dinakaran along with his other colleague facing similar accusations Justice Soumitra Sen will keep getting their post-retirement benefits, even though they resigned ahead of impeachment proceedings against them, as there are no Constitutional or statutory provisions restricting their entitlements in such a scenario.

He began his military career before World War I when he enlisted as a private in the 3rd New York Infantry Regiment. Joining the Air Service, he became an ace in France in 1918, credited with five aerial victories. George, known as \\"Pursuit\\" George to distinguish him from Harold L. George (\\"Bomber\\" George), commanded the 5th Interceptor Command (Provisional) on Luzon following the attack by Japan on the Philippine Islands, then directed the remnants of the Army's air forces in the Philippine Islands after Far East Air Force commander Maj. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton evacuated to Australia on 24 December 1941. World War I service George joined the New York National Guard on 5 July 1916, during the crisis caused by Pancho Villa's raid on Columbus, New Mexico. His unit was federalized and deployed to the Mexican border, where he served as a sergeant until 5 October. George enlisted as an aviation cadet on 15 April 1917, in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. He completed flying training on the Curtiss biplane at Hazelhurst Field, Mineola, New York, received a rating of Reserve Military Aviator, and was commissioned a first lieutenant in the Signal Officers Reserve Corps (SORC) on 15 September 1917. He went to Kelly Field, Texas, for additional training before going to Tours, France, as commanding officer of the 201st Aero Squadron in October 1917. For six months he instructed other pilots at the Air Service AEF's training center at Issoudun. He then took pursuit pilot and gunnery courses himself and went into combat in August 1918 with the 185th Aero Squadron, and later duty with the 139th Aero Squadron. George arrived at the 139th Aero Squadron on 18 September 1918. He scored his first two victories on 27 October, near Bantheville, France, he struck a formation of four enemy Fokkers, destroying two and driving the other two away. George shot down a Fokker D.VII single- handed and shared a second win with Robert Opie Lindsay. Two days later, he doubled again, sharing the wins over Fokker D.VIIs with Edward Haight and Karl Schoen. On 5 November, he shared his fifth victory over a D.VII with two other pilots, and became an ace. His Distinguished Service Cross came through after war's end, in 1919 After his return to the United States, George married Vera McKenna, whom he had met in Tours where she was working, on 5 April 1919, in New York City. They had two children, Robert (b. 1920) and Peggy (b. 1922). Between wars After the war he returned to the United States for duty at Langley Field, Virginia. In November 1919 he became flight commander and commanding officer of the 19th Pursuit Squadron at March Field, California, serving until March 1922. During that time he applied for and received a regular Army commission as captain, Air Service, 0n 1 July 1920, when the Air Service became a combat arm of the line. He went to Fort Douglas, Utah, for three years as Air Service Officer to the 104th Division. He was transferred to the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field in March 1925, as an instructor for two years, commanding officer of the 43d School Squadron, and Chief of Pursuit Instruction to July 1929. He was then assigned to France Field, Panama for a two-year tour, as operations officer and commanding officer of the 24th Pursuit and 7th Observation Squadrons, respectively. He returned to Langley Field on 25 June 1932, as commanding officer of the 33d Pursuit Squadron, followed by assignments as intelligence and operations officer of the 8th Pursuit Group. In 1934 he commanded a sector of the Eastern Zone of Army Air Corps Mail Operation, responsible for Air mail operations on routes between Newark, New Jersey; Cleveland, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri; and Memphis, Tennessee. From September 1936 to June 1937, he attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, followed in 1937-1938 by the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. His next assignment was to Selfridge Field, Michigan with the 1st Pursuit Group, where he commanded its 94th Pursuit Squadron. On 1 February 1940, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and named commander of the 31st Pursuit Group, newly activated at Selfridge. George commanded an aircraft-ferrying flight to Panama via Mexico and Central America, exactly 20 years after he had flown a DeHaviland plane to the Pacific Coast and return to New York in an early-day transcontinental reliability test flight.

On 4 May 1941, Brig. Gen. Henry B. Clagett arrived at Manila in the Philippines to command the newly created Philippine Department Air Force. George, promoted to colonel on 9 October 1940, accompanied him as his chief of staff. As the War Department belatedly attempted to expand the defenses in the Philippines, the air forces evolved first into the Air Force, United States Army Forces Far East in August, and then into the Far East Air Force in November 1941. Clagett was named commander of the 5th Interceptor Command (Provisional) and George remained as his chief of staff after a short stint as head of supply for FEAF. When Clagett was sent to Australia in mid-December, George inherited the pursuit command, and when Brereton and a small staff also left on 24 December, George became de facto commander of the remaining Army aviation units and personnel. He was promoted to brigadier general on 25 January 1942, and made his command post at Mariveles on the Bataan peninsula. On 11 March 1942, he was evacuated from Corregidor by PT boat along with Gen. Douglas MacArthur. General George was awarded the Silver Star for his actions on Corregidor.

It is a five-story Romanesque Revival structure built for the local Scottish Rite branch of Freemasonry. It was declared a historic landmark in 1980. Description The five-story Romanesque Revival building was built for use in the Scottish Rite branch of Freemasonry. It was built from 1925 to 1926 from steel frame and reinforced concrete with exterior granite terra cotta. Architects Wright & Gentry prepared the drawings for the building as well as the Long Beach York Rite Temple. The general contractor on the project was W.E. Campbell. The building's auditorium is considered an outstanding example of early 20th Century opulence. The 30-foot-high ceiling has hand-painted designs. The stage measures 27 feet across the front curtain area and is 40 feet deep. It is used for theatrical performances, weddings, and other events. There is seating for 800. History The groundbreaking for the building was in July 1925. The skeleton of steel, weighing approximately 500 tons, was installed in just 27 days. Some 250 tons of ornamental terra cotta purchased from the Los Angeles Pressed Brick Company were also used on the structure. Architect Parker O. Wright described the choice of materials as follows: \\"Steel was selected because buildings of this type are more enduring and more nearly earthquake proof than those of any other material.\\" The cathedral was dedicated in September 1926 in a three-day ceremony during which several hundred individuals were invested with various degrees of Masonry. At the time of its opening, the Los Angeles Times called it \\"one of the most beautiful structures of its kind in the West.\\" The total cost of the building with furnishings was estimated to be $500,000. In 1980, the building became the eighth structure to be designated as a Long Beach Historic Landmark. At the time, the Los Angeles Times referred to it as an \\"enormous\\" building with an \\"imposing facade\\" and an \\"elaborately decorated main auditorium.\\" See also * List of City of Long Beach Historic Landmarks References Category:Buildings and structures in Long Beach, California Category:Masonic buildings in California Category:Masonic buildings completed in 1926 Category:Landmarks in Long Beach, California ","title":"Scottish Rite Cathedral (Long Beach, California)"},{"id":"24372390","text":"Inception is a 2010 film directed by Christopher Nolan.

Vdara opened on December 1, 2009 as a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Infinity World Development. Vdara's 57-story, tower houses 1,495 suites; an , two-story spa, salon and fitness center; a market and a bar. It also has a pool and deck area. Vdara does not contain casino space and, along with Waldorf Astoria, is one of two non-gaming, non-smoking hotels within CityCenter. In 2010, it was discovered that the hotel's reflective surface and concave design can act as a parabolic reflector that creates conditions of extremely high temperature at the pool deck. In 2011, Vdara received its first AAA Four Diamond Award. The hotel's name was thought up by the property‚Äôs original design-group: The \\"V\\" in Vdara stands for \\"Vegas\\" and \\"ara\\" is meant to evoke established high-end boutique hotels, such as the Aviara or Bacara. History Vdara, designed by Rafael Vinoly of RV Architecture, LLC, is a condo-hotel, located between the Aria Resort & Casino and the Bellagio. Vdara's 57-story tower houses 1,495 units, ranging from 526 to 1,750 sq ft (48.9 to 162.6 m2). The Architect of Record was Leo A. Daly, while the Detroit-based firm Hamilton Anderson Associates was the Architect of Record for the interior guest rooms. Tishman Construction Corporation served as Construction Manager, and Perini Building Company was the project's General Contractor. Vdara was the first tower to open December 1, 2009. Vdara was the first of the six high rises in the project to be topped out on May 14, 2008. Vdara was the first of six projects to be completed as part of the $8.5 billion CityCenter complex. Vdara's opening on December 1, 2009 was followed by The Crystals, a retail shopping center; Mandarin Oriental and Aria Resort & Casino in the same month. Prior to its opening, Vdara was designated as a LEED Gold award building and received a five-key rating from the Green Key Eco- Rating Program. Designed by Rafael Vi√±oly of RV Architecture, LLC, Vdara's 57-story crescent-shaped structure is formed by three parallel, offset arcs of varying heights. Because of its staggered arc design, Vdara contains six corner suites per floor, compared to four in a conventional building. The curvature of the building was designed as complementary to the arcs of Aria Resort & Casino, which is located across a shared circular driveway. Facilities Art Artwork is incorporated into Vdara's interior and exterior design. Nancy Rubin's canoe sculpture Big Edge is displayed at the entrance of the hotel and an painting by Frank Stella hangs above the registration desk in the lobby. Suites Vdara contains 1,495 suites which include studios, deluxe studios, one- and two-bedroom suites and one- and two- bedroom penthouses. The units range from in size and contain a kitchen as well as a washing machine and dryer. The suites at Vdara are sold as private residences and owners have the option to participate in a rental program to lease their condos as hotel rooms when they are not residing there. The unsold pool of condos are structured as permanent hotel rooms managed by MGM Resorts International. Attractions Looking up at the Vdara, 2010 An two-story spa and salon called Spa & Salon Vdara is made up of 11 private treatment rooms, a sauna, a steam room, co-ed lounges, a full service salon, a fitness center and a smoothie bar.

Vdara has approximately of meeting space that includes a ballroom and three breakout rooms, one of which is a 14-person board room. Solar convergence In 2010, it was established that the building's reflective surface and concave design can act as a collecting mirror. The parallel incoming radiation from the sun is partially reflected and focuses in one dimension to a still onedimensional vertical line that lies about f = 50 m in front of the facade and hits the ground.Vdara hotel maps.google.com ‚Äì satellite view allows to see, that the concave ‚Äì full rectangular ‚Äì rectangular forefront facade has a horizontally bending radius r of about 100 m, which makes the focal length (f = r / 2) to be about 50 m, is bent about circular, is about 60 m broad and its area faces to SSW. The much less compact facade right behind the first one has a similar radius and faces to south. Vdara lies 36.11 degrees north, the air temperatures can rise pretty high in Las Vegas. Some sources claim: The reflected rays of the sun create dangerous conditions of extremely high temperature at the pool deck. Hotel employees as well as local news outlets have reportedly taken to calling the phenomenon the \\"death ray,\\" with the management describing it as a \\"solar convergence\\". Vdara management has considered various solutions but the challenge in overcoming the structural, design problem is that the sun and its reflection are targets that are constantly moving during the day and as every season progresses. In the meantime, management has installed large blue umbrellas over the pool deck to protect bathers,\\"The 'death ray hotel' burning Las Vegas visitors came up with a simple fix\\" by Leanna Garfield, Business Insider, 30 June 2016 while the hotel's glass exterior has been covered with non-reflective film.\\"'[Vdara] was a completely different problem,' said Vi√±oly, insisting he was following a masterplan that specified arc-shaped towers.

It generally refers to debt that is more than 3 years old, is long forgotten about or belonged to someone else ‚Äì like someone with the same name or a deceased parent. The amount owed can grow to hundreds or thousands of dollars more than what was originally owed. A great example of this is from George Lovelock. George missed an 11 cent Verizon bill and seven years later it had grown to $4,000.00. Sometimes it was never owed, was owed by a deceased parent, or that was previously owed by the presumed debtor, but was previously paid in full, settled, discharged via bankruptcy or a dismissed court case, is beyond the statute of limitations, or is otherwise not legally collectible, but that a collection agency or other similar service is aggressively attempting to collect, often fraudulently. While the concept of phantom debt is quite old, it has gotten a lot of attention since the 1990s. Very often, collectors of phantom debt use intimidating, abusive, or otherwise illegal tactics in an attempt to collect phantom debt that include frequent phone calls, calls to the victim's place of employment, or threats of scary consequences against the victim that sometimes include arrest and/or criminal prosecution. In the United States, such tactics violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Sometimes, the source of phantom debt is from collectors who buy the debt from other collectors for pennies on the dollar, then take action that is not always legal in order to collect it. Techniques used include suing or threatening to sue, reaging it on the victim's credit report, or promising to remove a negative credit mark in exchange for a partial payment. When the latter occurs, the agency will often not follow through, and will re-sell the debt to another similar agency that will engage in the same practices.

He became a lieutenant-colonel in the Territorial Army between the wars, returning to the RAF in World War II, and rising to the rank of squadron leader. Biography Early life and background Gribben was born in County Down, Ireland, and in the 1911 Census was recorded as resident at Dunnanew, Rossconor, unmarried, aged 23, and working as a draper's assistant in Castlewellan. He was living with his mother Alice Gribben, father Thomas, and six siblings. World War I Gribben joined the army soon after the outbreak of World War I, being commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the 5th Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles on 15 August 1914. He was promoted to lieutenant on 22 May 1915, and was later seconded to the Royal Flying Corps to train as a pilot, being appointed a flying officer on 24 December 1916. Gribben was posted to No. 70 Squadron in early 1917. He flew a Sopwith Camel to score five victories between 17 July and 13 August, his final tally being two enemy aircraft destroyed, and three driven down out of control. On 9 September, he returned to England to serve with No. 44 Squadron as a night fighter pilot flying a Camel.Shores et.al. (1990), p.177. On 26 September he was awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 8 January 1918. His citation read: ;Military Cross :Lieutenant Edward Gribben, Royal Irish Rifles, Special Reserve, and Royal Flying Corps. ::For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on offensive patrols. In every combat he has been most conspicuous, continually attacking superior numbers of the enemy, destroying some and driving others down out of control. He fights with great dash and skill, and whenever any machine of his formation is in difficulties, he is invariably at hand to render assistance. On 1 January 1918 he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. Gribben then served as a test pilot at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. He returned to combat on 2 October 1918 as a flight commander in No. 41 Squadron. Two days later, he and his Camel were badly shot up by a Fokker D.VII; although wounded in the arm, Gribben crash-landed safely. Inter-war career Gribben left the RAF on 24 January 1920, being transferred to the unemployed list. He relinquished his army commission in what was now the Royal Ulster Rifles on 1 April 1920. On 4 May 1920 he was granted a short service commission in the RAF with the rank of flight lieutenant, but this was cancelled on 10 August 1920. Gribben return to the military when appointed a captain in the 18th Battalion, London Regiment (London Irish Rifles), a Territorial Army unit, on 15 March 1930. On 1 November 1934 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. On 1 November 1938 Gribben retired from the London Irish, giving up his command. World War II and after Just prior to the outbreak of World War II Gribben joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, being commissioned as a flight lieutenant on 1 September 1939. He was promoted to squadron leader on 16 December 1941. He remained a member of the Air Force Reserves post-war, finally relinquishing his commission on 10 February 1954, at the age of 65.

Plot Recently widowed Margery Heywood (Penelope Keith) and her cleaning woman Gladys Gladwell (June Brown) disturb a would-be burglar breaking into Margery's house in Kent. Margery attacks the burglar with a heavy glass vase, and knocks him unconscious. Believing that she has killed him, she panics and flees the house with Gladys, leaving behind her handbag. In Gladys's car, the two women decide to try to reach Margery's son Graham in Milton Keynes, hoping he'll give them shelter and money, but the trip turns into a comedy of disasters. They are forced to break into a pharmacy to obtain insulin for Gladys's diabetes, 'do a runner' from a petrol station and dodge police cameras on the M25. Margery is devastated to learn of a twenty-year affair between her late husband and Gladys - and that her son knew of it. His father also secretly bought a boat and planned to sail away with a childhood friend. With the police, led by about-to-retire Detective Inspector Woolley (Roger Lloyd-Pack) on their trail, the two women drive to Fleetwood, only to meet the childhood friend.

Bronze Statue of Johannes van der Kemp at Maropeng (Exhibition Long March to Freedom) Dr Johannes Theodorus van der Kemp (17 May 1747 in Rotterdam ‚Äì 15 December 1811 in Cape Town) was a military officer, doctor and philosopher who became a missionary in South Africa. Early life The second son of Cornelius van der Kemp, Rotterdam's leading reformed clergyman, and Anna Maria van Teylingen, he attended the Latin schools of Rotterdam and Dordrecht. He subsequently enrolled at the University of Leiden in 1763 where he studied medicine, but when his elder brother Didericus was appointed as professor of church history he abandoned his studies. Army career He joined the dragoon guards and fathered an illegitimate child, Johanna (‚ÄòAntje‚Äô), whom he brought up himself. In 1778 he fell in love with Christina (‚ÄòStijntje‚Äô) Frank (d. 1791). He lived with her for a year before being reprimanded by the Prince of Orange on this irregular state of affairs. As a result, he both married Stijntje, on 29 May 1779, and quit the army. Return to medicine Returning to his medical studies again, this in Edinburgh, he completed his Medical Doctorate within two years. He also prepared for publication a treatise in Latin on cosmology, entitled Parmenides which was published in 1781. He returned to the Netherlands, where he practised as a doctor first in Middelburg and then near Dordrecht. On 27 June 1791, his wife and daughter Antje were drowned in a yachting accident from which he only just escaped. As a result of this incident he experienced an emotional conversion back to the reformed Christianity of his family. He served as a medical officer during the revolutionary campaigns in Flanders and then as hospital superintendent at Zwijndrecht, near Dordrecht. Whilst there in 1797 he came to hear of the formation of the London Missionary Society.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://us.geocities.com/saintsnseasons/VdKemp1E.html&date;=2009-10-25+04:37:44 Missionary work After making contact with the London Missionary Society he helped found the Dutch version Nederlandsche Zendinggenootschap. He was ordained in London in November 1798 and began recruiting men for the society. He sailed from London in December 1798 as one of the first three agents sent by the society to Cape, arriving in March 1799. Whilst there in 1799 he published the first work in book-form in South Africa, which was an 8-page translation, into Dutch, of the London Missionary Society's letter that he brought out to the inhabitants of the Cape.

From the Xhosa he received the name Jank' hanna (‚Äòthe bald man‚Äô). War between Cape Colony and the Xhosa soon drove him back and from 1801 onwards he worked exclusively within the colony, mainly with dispossessed Hottentots. In 1803 he established a mission settlement for vagrant Hottentots at Bethelsdorp where local farmers accused him of harboring lawless elements. He countered with a list of alleged ill-treatment of the Hottentots by local farmers, but the evidence proved unsatisfactory and the farmers were acquitted. On 7 April 1806 he married Sara Janse, a freed slave 45 years his junior, and had four children with her. This situation and his attitudes caused great opposition from within the colony, and he was for a time ordered by the government to leave Bethelsdorp. Armed with a background in European and classical philology, he pioneered in the study of Xhosa and Khoikhoi languages. He was recalled to Cape Town by the Governor in 1811 and died soon afterwards In print Sarah Millin, one of the most popular English-language novelists in South Africa during her lifetime wrote The Burning Man about the life of van der Kemp. The life of Johannes van der Kemp during his mission in Bethelsdorp is included in the novel Praying Mantis by Andr√© Brink.

CAN aims to educate the public about the health impacts of air pollution and to mobilise public support for cleaner air in Hong Kong. According to Civic Exchange's environmental program director Mike Kilburn, CAN was created with the purpose of encouraging the public to speak out and support government measures that could improve the quality of air in Hong Kong. History CAN was established in July 2009, following a Civic Exchange conference focused on Hong Kong's air pollution situation in January of the same year. The Civic Exchange held a conference titled \\"The Air We Breathe ‚Äì A Public Health Dialogue\\", during which the idea of an organisation exclusively focused on air pollution aimed toward creating change at the highest level of government sparked. Objectives Clean Air Network envisions to clean up Hong Kong's air until it meets World Health Organization's recommended safe level in order to protect public health. CAN's mission is to amplify voices of individuals, groups and organisations, and together urge the government to take appropriate measures to clean up Hong Kong's air immediately. In 2017, CAN focused primarily to tackle local roadside air pollution, while regularly monitor the progress to reduce emission from marine vessels, power plants and regional sources. Approach Describing itself as a network, the company strives to bring together and amplify the voices of individuals, groups and organisations in order to pressurise the government to take immediate actions to clean Hong Kong's air. The establishment is focused on informing the general public and aims to present information in ways that are digestible to laypeople. The organisation consistently supports the government in its endeavours to clean up Hong Kong's air through non-confrontational means, acting as its \\"honest mirror\\".\\"A Snapshot of CAN's Recent Achievements\\", Clean Air Network, 21 May 2012 CAN works closely with District Councilors, Legislative Council members, and private sector corporations. The company also maintains close relations with the Environmental Protection Department and provides research reports, fact sheets and other documents on issues related to its work to help raise awareness and provide information to policy and decision makers. CAN has also given numerous talks at educational institutions. In addition to speaking to and maintaining close relations with student groups at many of Hong Kong's universities (Hong Kong University, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology), CAN has also spoken at local and international schools. The organisation also offers a student air monitoring program, which allows students to physically monitor the air pollutants of their school and home environments first-hand. Within the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, a total of 11 schools will have participated in their program. The company believes that the involvement of youth is essential in laying the foundation for an environmentally-conscious society, and thus has pioneered many activities specifically suited for them. The Clean Air Network regularly uses social media, including services such as YouTube and Twitter, to spread its message and to provide updates on air pollution-related issues. For instance, the organisation offers real-time email alerts that note when air pollution levels reach hazardous levels (API exceeding 100). CAN also offers a weekly e-newsletter that summarises news headlines, events, and other information relevant to air pollution and its operations. Additionally, they hold unique educational events targeting the public, ranging from scavenger hunts to film festivals. For example, CAN held a mask design competition in the district of Sham Shui Po (\\"ÁΩ©Èáè‚îÄÊ∑±Ê∞¥ÂüóÂè£ÁΩ©Ë®≠Ë®àËºÉÈáè\\" in Chinese) which engaged local artists and emphasised the severity of air pollution in Hong Kong. CAN also works towards gathering and articulating the public's opinion by both conducting in-house surveys and by offering a database of survey results from external organisations. For example, the organisation administered surveys from 10 paediatrician's offices that looked at parent's knowledge and attitudes towards Hong Kong's air quality and their children's respiratory health. Work Anti-Idling Bill The Anti-idling Ordinance has been a significant milestone in the regulation of Hong Kong's road side emissions. The bill, first brought to the public attention in June 2010, was intended to prevent motorists from keeping their engines on while not in motion. The anti- idling ban now offers a three-minute grace period every hour a vehicle is running and various other exemptions. CAN has been in support of the bill since its inception. In June 2010, during the Legislative Council's hearing of public statements for and against the anti-idling bill, the organisation secured the appearance of two Hong Kong medical associations, the Hong Kong Society of Pediatrics and the Hong Kong Asthma Society, represented by Dr. Aaron Yu Chak-man and Dr. Alfred Tam Yat-cheung, respectively. Both doctors defended the bill and fielded questions from groups against the anti-idling ordinance. CAN also helped to bring about the unprecedented appearance of students at such events when students from Chinese International School, respectively, implored lawmakers to protect their health instead of subordinating society's interests to narrow constituencies‚Äô demands. CAN also backed the Secretary of the Environment, Edward Yau by accompanying him during his consultation with Hong Kong's transportation industry workers. CAN also recognises that exemptions to the anti-idling bill must be put into place, but must be done so cautiously in order to avoid defeating the purpose of the bill. Although such a law would not be the end all and be all solution to improving Hong Kong's roadside air quality, CAN's CEO Joanne Ooi believes that it is \\"a crucial step to changing attitudes in society at large towards air pollution.\\" Environmental Impact Assessment The Clean Air Network has worked towards encouraging the Panel of Environmental Affairs to review its Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance and to make amendments so that public health is considered during the assessment of new infrastructure projects. CAN wrote a letter to LegCo outlining the possible amendments to the Technical Memorandum. These changes suggested that the EIA should describe how the environment and community might be affected by the above change and what possible mitigation measures the party could use. With a third runway proposed to be built by the Hong Kong Airport Authority, CAN has done much to ensure that the project would not proceed unless a fully comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment has been carried out by the HKAA. The organisation jointly sent a letter to urge the EPD to seek further information from the HKAA to resolve or amend its EIA so that the project profile meets the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance. During the public consultation period, CAN was present along with 11 other environmental groups to voice their concerns. According to SCMP, this public consultation was \\"a first in the history of EIA submissions in terms of the level of attention it [received] from environmental groups\\". According to CAN's Campaign Manager Erica Chan, \\"Many important issues are not explored in-depth in this project profile and that gives us a great deal of concern as to how much the development of the third runway will aggravate air pollution in Tung Chung and its surrounding areas, and even all of Hong Kong.\\" Hong Kong Chief executive Candidates With CAN's campaigning and petitioning, the organisation was able to bring the issue of air pollution onto the radar of the Hong Kong Chief executive Candidates during the years of 2011‚Äì2012. In December 2011, CAN presented the three Chief executive Candidates Henry Tang, CY Leung and Albert Ho with a \\"Clean Air Ballot\\" and a symbolic pair of black lungs. All three candidates accepted CAN's \\"clean air ballot\\" and pledged to improve air quality. This event received much note from the local news. On 3 March 2012 CAN, along with the WWF-Hong Kong, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth hosted an Environmental Policy Forum where the candidates did a question and answer period with the public. This was an achievement as this forum both began a dialogue on environmental issues and allowed the public to voice their concerns. PM2.5 The organisation offers self-monitored air quality reports twice daily from Monday to Friday, which has been available even before the government's release of air quality data. Their data is taken from their Sheung Wan office and is based on an hourly average. CAN also offers alerts when API levels reach hazardous levels (above API 100). This information is accessible on their website and through their various social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter. CAN also rents out PM2.5 monitoring machines, SIDEPAK AM510s, thus allowing people to monitor the air quality in their own homes and neighbourhoods. The organisation has used their PM2.5 data as a means of bringing attention to the health concerns associated with Hong Kong's air pollution. For instance, their preliminary air quality monitoring showed that PM2.5 levels exceeded the recommended guidelines from the WHO. CAN also intended for their self-monitored report to act as a catalyst in encouraging the government to publish citywide PM2.5 levels in real-time. CAN believes that real time PM2.5 data is necessary, as \\"people need to know, right now, the level of air pollution harming their health,\\" according to CAN campaign manager Erica Chan. Eventually, through politicising and lobbying, CAN influenced the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) to monitor PM2.5 levels every hour and to release the data to the public. Data is now gathered from 14 different monitoring stations, although the organisation still finds the government's actions inadequate as a majority of monitors are placed above ground level and do not accurately measure the pollutants the average person would be exposed to. As well, six districts in Hong Kong still lack air quality monitoring stations, with the said districts being the Southern District, Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City, North, Sai Kung and Tuen Mun. Social Media and Technology Aside from the use of Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms, Clean Air Network has used other technological means to engage with the public. In Sept 2009, CAN teamed up with a youth filmmaking non-governmental organisation, Focus on Film, to raise public awareness about the issue of Hong Kong's air quality. \\"Clean Air 1‚Äì2 Go\\" involved 200 students who made short films about Hong Kong's air pollution that were eventually aired on monitors in Hong Kong's major malls. During the Summer of 2010, CAN introduced a suite of innovative environmental information tools comprising a Real-time Air Pollution Facebook Widget, Real-time Air Pollution Email Alerts (Beta), an iPhone app and Daily Lunchtime Roadside Pollution Tweets. These tools give the public immediate, updated readings about air pollution and, in some cases, push alerts, in a convenient, readable format, allowing them to stay on top of air pollution conditions in real time. Of particular significance is a public service announcement CAN released. The video stars popular celebrities Daniel Wu, Ana R., Simon Yin and Cara G, and is shot in the style of a 1980s-style infomercial. The PSA is a fake advertisement about canned oxygen brand and takes a humorous, satirical approach in order to provoke viewers to imagine pollution so bad that one has to purchase healthy air from a can in order to perform even everyday functions. This video is claimed to be the most successful in Hong Kong NGO history and has since gone viral, with the Cantonese version receiving more than 210K views. CAN also organised Hong Kong's first flash mob dedicated to air pollution in June 2011. In this event, 80 volunteers wearing gas masks and T-shirts bearing health messages pretended to die from air pollution by laying sprawled on the pavement outside of Sogo. The bizarre sight garnered the attention of passersby and educated them about the health concerns associated with air pollution. Air Quality Objectives Prior to 2009, Hong Kong's AQOs had not seen revision for more than 20 years. CAN believes that relevant AQOs are essential to having good air quality and that in constructing the air quality objectives, the government should hold the protection of public health as their primary objective. CAN has pressured the government to update and enforce its Air Quality Objectives on many instances. In January 2011, CAN, Friends of the Earth and other green groups filed an ombudsman complaint collectively in order to protest the government's failure to fulfill their promise to review and revise the Air Quality Objectives. The organisations requested that the government set a timetable to meet the objectives and explain to the public whether any progress has been made. Although following the complaint the government was not found guilty of maladministration, the ordeal was able to garner public attention towards the government's lack of action. In December 2011, CAN held a Dark Christmas Carnival in protest of Donald Tsang's had promised that by the end of the year ‚Äìgenerally lax attitude towards cleaning Hong Kong's air. Approximately 50 participants decked out in black clothing and costumes gathered in causeway bay, where they filled black balloons with polluted air. The crowd then marched to the Government House where the balloon was popped and the gift of polluted, roadside air was given to Donald Tsang. At the scene, CAN's CEO Stephen Wong gave a speech where he explained that the state of Hong Kong air is at critical levels and that the gift was in hopes of allowing the Chief Executive to understand how it feels to breathe in roadside air. This event saw much coverage from local news stations, including Oriental Daily, Apple Daily, MingPao, and Yahoo. In light of Donald Tsang's failure to keep his promise of announcing new AQOs within 2011 and to \\"combat air pollution in order to protect public health,\\" Clean Air Network collaborated with Friends of the Earth in a petition for clean air. 10,000 signatures were collected during the petition, numbers which represented a significantly stronger response from the public, in comparison to their petition held throughout the year of 2010, where 25,000 signatures were collected. Although the Clean Air Network was content with the government's proposal of new AQOs in 2012, the organisation still saw that they were not up to par in protecting public health. Clean Air Network's CEO Helen Choy stated that the AQOs \\"are not even close to being comparable to the WHO's recommended guidelines\\" and that the Government \\"should set a clear timetable for adopting the WHO's recommended guidelines\\". The organisation has also done independent research surrounding the issues with the new AQOs which they have published, including a budget study which outlined the government's economic investments towards cleaning Hong Kong's air. Community Outreach The Clean Air Network greatly focuses on dispersing information about air pollution through various facets in order to reach a great demographic. In the spring of 2011, CAN joined up with Sotheby's and 40 international artists to hold a Clean Air Auction, the first of its kind and scale in Asia. Environmentally-themed artwork was on display in IFC's oval atrium in March and subsequently auctioned in April at Sotheby's Hong Kong Contemporary Asian Art Spring Auction at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center. The auction ended with the sale of 42 lots and raised a total of $2.2 million. As well, CAN holds an annual event called the Airmazing Race, a scavenger hunt intended to raise awareness towards air pollution through the completion of various tasks. On 25 July 2011, CAN held their first instalment of The Airmazing Race where Approximately 300 youths aged 11‚Äì18, representing 75 schools, competed in this scavenger hunt for clean air. The race consisted of tasks that ranged from finding and photographing Hong Kong's three air monitoring system to taking photographs with \\"the blue man\\". The race is also to be held again in July of the following year where around 800 students are expected to take part. Education During the first half of 2011, CAN wrote six bilingual educational modules about air pollution for secondary school students and teachers to assist in the teaching of Hong Kong secondary school's Liberal Studies requirement. The materials were made available to the public through Ming Pao's Liberal Studies portal. Letters were sent to all schools in Hong Kong informing teachers and principals about the availability of the materials. CAN also routinely holds student air quality monitoring programs in conjunction with schools in the Hong Kong area. This program has been done with approximately 20 schools, including the Diocesan Boys' School and Lingnan Secondary School.

Life at Constantinople As Gregory‚Äôs father was an important governor and a formidable general, Alexios I was keen to align him with the imperial family. Consequently, Gregory was with his father in Constantinople during the late 1080s when he became engaged to a daughter of Alexios‚Äô brother, the sebastokrator Isaac Komnenos. Gregory was left with the imperial court as his father returned to Trebizond. Shortly afterwards Gregory‚Äôs mother died, and his father soon remarried, this time to a noblewoman of the Alani who happened to be the first cousin of Isaac Komnenos‚Äô wife. When this became known in the capital, Gregory‚Äôs engagement was quietly broken off as they were now considered close relatives and according to civil and the ecclesiastical laws, such marriages were forbidden. Alexios, however, was worried about Theodore‚Äôs reaction, so he kept Gregory at the court as a hostage in order to ensure Theodore‚Äôs continued good behaviour, reassuring Theodore with the claim that he was contemplating marrying Gregory to one of his own daughters. Theodore soon returned to the capital and hatched a plan to abduct his son and return with him to Trebizond. He took the boy as far as the port of Pharus before fleeing by ship into the Euxine. Alexios was soon advised and he responded by sending a squadron of ships to capture father and son. They overtook Theodore near the town of Aeginus and advised him to hand over his son to the emperor‚Äôs representatives. To persuade him they once again reiterated the emperor‚Äôs desire to marry Gregory to one of his daughters, Maria Komnene. Seeing he had no choice Theodore complied and Gregory soon found himself once again sequestered within Constantinople. Defiance against Alexios I On his return Alexios only ratified the marriage-contract by the usual legal formalities and placed Gregory in the care of one of the Empress‚Äô attendants, the eunuch Michael. Michael soon instituted a rigorous educational and martial program for the boy, which Gregory soon grew to resent. He disliked his tutor, had a hard time following the rules, and was irritated at not being treated with the respect a future member of the imperial family deserved. His thoughts soon turned to how he could escape from the court and return to his father. Gathering a small group of conspirators, some of whom were soldiers who were close to the emperor, Gregory outlined his plans for escaping. One of them did report Gregory‚Äôs plans to Alexios, but the emperor refused to believe him. So those few who were loyal to Alexios then hatched a plot to capture the unsuspecting Gregory and his supporters red-handed. When Gregory insisted that he wanted to flee Constantinople immediately, they told him that they would not go along with his plan unless he guaranteed his plot to them by an oath. Gregory agreed and so they took him to the church where one of the nails of Jesus Christ‚Äôs crucifixion was kept. Here they told him to steal the sacred relic and bring it out so that he could swear by it. Gregory, being young and na√Øve, listened to them and stole the sacred object. At that point, one of the men who had kept the emperor apprised of the conspiracy went to fetch some guards and returned shouting, \\"Look, here is Gabras, and the sacred nail is within his clothes next to his chest.\\"Comnena, p. 212 Gregory was arrested and brought into the emperor‚Äôs presence, where the nail was revealed. On being questioned he admitted everything while also revealing the names of his fellow conspirators. Alexios found him guilty and sent him to George Mesopotamites, Dux of Philippopolis, who was ordered to keep him imprisoned in one of the towers in the city. Gregory‚Äôs co-conspirators were all banished or imprisoned. References Sources * Anna Comnena, The Alexiad, translated E.R.A.

He played college football at Michigan from 2006 to 2009. He was signed by the Chicago Bears as an undrafted free agent in 2010, but was released during the final cuts and played on practice squads in 2010 for the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts. At Michigan, Minor finished second on the team in rushing both as a freshman and sophomore and led the team in rushing both as a junior and senior. As a junior, he was an honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference selection by the coaches. He had previously been ranked as the number one high school football fullback in the nation, according to Rivals.com. He spent his first two years at Michigan serving as one of the primary backups to Mike Hart. In his third year, he emerged from a field of five running backs who were vying to replace Hart as the leading rusher and scorer. He has shared starting responsibilities in his junior and senior seasons. He entered his senior season on the watch lists for the Doak Walker and Maxwell Awards. ESPN.com ranked him as the 22nd best player and third best running back in the Big Ten Conference before the season started. Youth career Minor grew up as a Michigan Wolverines fan. His mother, Julie Gilliam, has pictures of him at age six wearing a Michigan uniform. At age nine, Minor wrote the university to inquire about becoming a Michigan football player. Every year he and his mother watched the Michigan - Ohio State game and rooted for Michigan. High school Minor inherited the Varina High School starting varsity team role as a sophomore in 2003, and he gained 209 rushing yards in his first start. That season, he helped his team reach the Virginia Central Region, Division 6 championship (the qualifying game for the Virginia High School League state semifinals). He concluded the regular season as an All-District first-team selection and after the playoffs was selected as a second-team all-region choice. During the season, he rushed for 1,750 yards and 22 touchdowns for the 10-2 (7-0) Varina Blue Devils. Minor also played varsity basketball as a sophomore. During the season, he once made seven three-point field goals in a game. As a junior, when Varina's former Capital District offensive player of the year Army Spc. Clarence Adams III died serving the 91st Engineer Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division in Baghdad, Iraq, Minor gave up his number 3 to wear Adams' #33 as a tribute. In the District championship game, he rushed for 239 yards on 27 carries, including four touchdown runs. In the subsequent Central Region, Division 6 semifinals, he set a Central Region playoff record by rushing for 296 yards, but his undefeated top-ranked team was upset. He concluded the season as both a first- team all-district and all-Metro Region selection after compiling 2,091 yards rushing and scoring 32 rushing touchdowns (plus 2 receiving touchdowns). He was also selected to the Group AAA Virginia High School Football Coaches Association all-state second-team by the coaches. Entering his senior season, he was ranked as the sixth best senior football player in Virginia by TechSideline.com. The Roanoke Times described him as \\"one of the top five recruits in the state\\" at the time of his August 2005 visit to see the first day of Virginia Tech Hokies football practice. At the time, he was considering Miami, Michigan, Florida, Virginia Tech, Tennessee, LSU and Ohio State. However, he started the season on crutches, due to a torn hip flexor. He returned to the lineup for the team's final regular season game and rushed for 174 yards on 28 carries. Davon Morgan, his cousin, who now plays strong safety for Virginia Tech, was the team's quarterback. Despite missing most of the season, he was still honored as an all-district and all-region selection. His three-year career totals were 4,259 yards and 64 touchdowns. As a graduating senior he was the number one ranked high school football fullback in the nation, according to rivals.com. Following his senior season, he scored the only touchdown in the East-West Virginia High School Coaches Association All- star game. College career Minor eludes James Laurinaitis during the 2008 Michigan ‚Äì Ohio State rivalry game Lloyd Carr era In January 2006, Minor selected the University of Michigan. Although he did not enroll in the 2006 Summer semester, he reported to Michigan on June 16 for strength and conditioning training. Minor and fellow freshman Carlos Brown were behind three returning running backs (Mike Hart, Kevin Grady and senior Jerome Jackson) on the depth chart entering the season. Minor was considered the less heralded than Brown, who was regarded as the fastest player on the team. On opening day, only Hart and Grady had more carries than Minor, in part because Jackson, who entered his senior season with 505 career rushing yards, did not dress. In his first carry as a Wolverine, he rushed for 24 yards against the Vanderbilt Commodores during the September 2 season opening game. Nonetheless, the depth chart was not very clear behind Hart. By late September, Minor was clearly third on the depth chart and it seemed that Brown might be redshirted. When Hart left the game due to injury against Michigan State on October 7, Minor scored his first touchdown on a 40-yard run. He had his first 100-yard game on November 4, when he rushed for 108 yards on 12 carries, including a 40-yard touchdown run in a 34-26 win against Ball State. As a true freshman member of the 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team, Minor rushed for a total of 238 yards on 42 carries, which was second on the team to Hart. During April 2007, Grady tore his anterior cruciate ligament and was lost for the season. In August, Brown broke his hand. It appeared Minor was seriously injured on October 13 when he was carted off the field and left the stadium wearing a protective boot on crutches. However, he recovered and for the next two weeks he and Brown combined to replace the injured Hart. He had his second 100-yard game and first 150-yard game on October 27 of that season during the 34-10 Little Brown Jug game victory against the Minnesota Golden Gophers when he rushed for 157 yards on 21 carries, including a 46-yard run and one touchdown. Although Hart returned to play in the Paul Bunyan Trophy game against Michigan State on November 3, he left the game early and Minor started the second half. Hart missed the next game on November 10, but Brown and Minor had poor performances. In all three of Hart's full game absences, Brown was the starter. As a sophomore on the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team, Minor improved his rushing totals to 385 yards on 90 carries, which was again second on the team to Hart. Rich Rodriguez era alt=American football player in white, yellow and blue uniform prepares to hand the football to a teammate. In 2008 Rich Rodriguez replaced Lloyd Carr as head coach. In the spring, Brown broke his finger weightlifting and Grady was still trying to get healthy. In early August, it appeared that juniors Brown and Minor would vie for the starting job because fourth-year junior Grady was under suspension related to driving while intoxicated charges. However, in camp it became apparent very quickly that true freshmen Sam McGuffie and Michael Shaw, would have a significant role in the newly installed spread option offense. With both Brown and Minor nursing injuries, McGuffie was tentatively penciled into the starting position on the depth chart. Minor is among those storming the field with the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team as it enters Michigan Stadium. As a junior member of the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team, Minor became the team leader in rushing. However, he only started four games, while McGuffie started 6, Brown started 1 and Shaw started 1. McGuffie was the starter until he lost the job to Minor. Minor gave way to Shaw (November 8) and Brown (November 15) as the starter due to his injuries. Minor totalled 533 yards on 103 carries. He had nine rushing touchdowns and added two as a receiver. Of these eleven touchdowns, seven came in a three-week span that included a 117-yard two-touchdown rushing effort against Penn State on October 18 and a 155-yard three-touchdown rushing effort against Purdue on November 1. Sandwiched between these efforts, Minor scored on a 19-yard reception to complement his 55 yards and a rushing touchdown in the Paul Bunyan Trophy game against Michigan State on October 25. The Penn State game was Minor's first career start. During Minor's junior year, he played with a wrist injury that impaired his ability to hold the football with his right arm and his ability to stiffarm opponents. He was impaired by a variety of injuries throughout the season. At the conclusion of the 2008 Big Ten Conference football season, Minor was chosen as an honorable mention all-conference selection by the coaches. Minor runs the ball with blocking by Kevin Grady (24), Mark Huyge (72), Martell Webb (80), Mark Ortmann (71), David Moosman (60), Stephen Schilling (52), and Perry Dorrestein (79) McGuffie transferred to the Rice Owls after the season. As a senior member of the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team, Minor was named to a pair of watch lists: (Doak Walker Award and Maxwell Award). He was also selected by ESPN as the 22nd best player and 3rd best running back (behind Evan Royster and John Clay) in the Big Ten Conference before the season started. Minor missed the first game of the season due to a high ankle sprain. In the second game, which was the 2009 Michigan ‚Äì Notre Dame rivalry game, he rushed for 106 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries during the 38-34 victory over Notre Dame. The ankle sprain hampered him much of the season and caused him to miss the October 17 game against Delaware State. He had a season-high 154-yard, 3-touchdown effort against Purdue on November 7. A shoulder injury kept him out of the last game of the season against Ohio State. Over the course of his collegiate career, he accumulated 20 rushing touchdowns and 1,658 yards. The torn rotator cuff also kept him from participating in the January 23, 2010 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. Professional career 2010 Minor signed with the Chicago Bears on April 24, 2010, after going undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was released on September 1. He then signed with the New Orleans Saints to their practice squad. However, Minor was back with the Bears before being released at the beginning of October and signed by the Indianapolis Colts. Minor was released by the Colts in October. In November, Minor tried out for the Green Bay Packers before ending the season as a member of the Denver Broncos' practice squad. 2011 On September 4, 2011, the Broncos placed Minor on injured reserve. They waived him on October 10. In November 2011, he was \\"charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute\\" by the Virginia Commonwealth University police department following a traffic stop. He is scheduled for a traffic court appearance on January 18.

Background  Police had known about the alleged abuse since 2005, when M first came forward, but could not act because she did not want to co-operate after her father threatened violence against her mother and siblings. The J family had been known to authorities for more than 30 years at the time the abuse came to light; three of RSJ's six children with his wife had died and others have spent time in state care. The allegations first emerged in a news report, that said authorities had failed to investigate after being warned of the abuse years earlier. During the years of abuse, M gave birth to four of her father's children, each in major hospitals in the state capital Melbourne. One child, a girl, died from severe brain and respiratory developmental problems at eleven weeks of age; two of the surviving boys are seriously intellectually disabled; and the third boy has a major speech impediment and social interaction problems. None of the children had fathers listed on their birth certificates, raising concerns about why questions were not asked at the time. The victim's mother was allegedly unaware of any abuse, despite sharing a house with her daughter, husband, and grandchildren until 2005. Trial RSJ was charged with 83 sexual abuse offences by police in June 2008 after DNA tests showed he was the father of M's children. M and her three surviving sons were taken into the care of the Victorian authorities. RSJ appeared in court in November 2009, where he pleaded guilty to ten counts of incest, two counts of indecent assault of a girl under the age of 16, and one count of common assault. He asked for the remaining 70 counts against him to be taken into consideration. During his sentencing in February 2010, County Court Judge Susan Pullen said: > \\"You defiled your daughter over many years on a regular basis. Your > offending involved a gross breach of trust. To describe your treatment of > your daughter as appalling is a gross understatement.\\" RSJ was sentenced to 22 years and five months' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 years and will be placed on the sex offender registry for the rest of his life. Time in custody taken into account, he will be eligible for parole in February 2027 at the age of 84. His appeal against the sentence was dismissed on 29 June 2012.

Somarelang Tikologo promotes the internationally acclaimed Waste Management Hierarchy of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, with an aim to ultimately achieve safe and proper landfill disposal with a focus on recycling. This waste management approach aims at conserving and protecting the limited and fragile natural resources, maintaining a healthy and clean environment, and a conducive environment for sustainable development.Statement from the Somarelang Tikologo website, click on Waste Management. Somarelang Tikologo has an on-site Recycling Center where anyone in Gaborone can drop off recyclable materials. Once sorted, the plastics and glass are transported by truck to recycling facilities in South Africa and all paper products are transported by truck to recycling facilities in Zimbabwe. The costs to transport all recyclable materials in this way is generously donated by Kgalagadi Beverages Trust. Resource Conservation The Somarelang Tikologo Resource Conservation Subcommittee conducts demonstration projects at local schools in Gaborone, as well as country-wide awareness-raising campaigns to educate Botswana about the importance of conservation of these resources. Popular topics of education include increasing the efficiency with which resources are utilised as well as to ensure equity in the distribution of the benefits accrued from harnessing said resources.Statement from the Somarelang Tikologo website, click on Resource Conservation Environmental Planning The Environmental Planning Sub-Committee aims to promote the integration of environmental issues into urban planning in Greater Gaborone and the rest of Botswana.

Ecological Park Community Playground Somarelang Tikologo is located inside an ecological park at Plot 3491 Ext 4 in Gaborone, Botswana. The park was officially opened by the Botswana Minister of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism, Hon. Onkokame kitso Mokaila on February 27, 2009. The park itself consists of five main components: Playground for children, the Green Shop, Community Organic Garden, Recycling Center, and Eco Cafe. Playground For Children The playground is open to the community for families and children to visit anytime during business hours. The purpose of the playground is to demonstrate fun and environmentally friendly ways that locals can make their own yards more entertaining, and also to help establish Somarelang Tikologo and thus Recycling as a welcomed part of the community.

All plastics and glass are transported by truck to recycling facilities in South Africa and all paper products are transported by truck to recycling facilities in Zimbabwe. The first of its kind in Botswana, this drop-off center has been used as a pilot project for the development of a number of other recycling drop-off centers constructed within Gaborone. It provides opportunities for Batswana (people of Botswana) to participate in the whole waste management process, which begins with sorting waste at home.Statement from the Somarelang Tikologo website.

Biography Urquhart was born in New York City and claimed to have been educated in a convent. On February 19, 1881, she made her first stage appearance, as a chorus girl in the Richard D'Oyly Carte and E. E. Rice Opera Companies' production of Billee Taylor at New York's Standard Theatre.Stone, David. Belle Urquhart at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, August 27, 2001, accessed June 26, 2010 She had a small role in an opera called Elves and Mermaids, which lasted only three performances because the manager absconded with the box-office money. She was also in the chorus in another D'Oyly Carte production, Claude Duval, the following season. Afterwards, Urquhart signed on with Augustin Daly's company from 1882 to 1883, acting in The Passing Regiment, Needles and Pins, and The Squire. In The Squire, the then 17-year-old played a 97-year-old woman, not without some reservations. She was persuaded to return to light opera because it paid better, though she stated in an interview that \\"I prefer legitimate drama to comic opera\\". Nonetheless, she had much success, with major roles in the genre, including the hit operetta Erminie, which ran from 1886 to 1888 at the Casino Theatre; Gilbert and Sullivan's The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), as Dame Carruthers; and W. S. Gilbert's translation of Offenbach's Les brigands (1889), as the Princess of Granada. As a leading lady in Erminie, according to a theatre program, she started a fashion trend by foregoing her petticoats \\"to accentuate her gorgeous figure\\". Urquhart also appeared in vaudeville. In 1897, she performed a sketch of her own devising at the Union Square Theatre, in which she \\"did little more ... than display her form in a handsome gown to the utmost advantage\\". p. 87 She later performed in several Broadway plays: The Diplomat (1902), Arms and the Man (1906), and How He Lied to Her Husband (1906). Urquhart was married for six years to Guy Standing, eight years her junior, from 1893 until they divorced. She was stricken with peritonitis on January 21, 1907. Two operations failed to save her, and she died on February 7, 1907, in Rochester, New York.

Murad, Leela Mishra as (Badi Bhi), Dev Kishan, Jugnu and V. Gopal are also featured in the film. Though the film didn't do well commercially, it was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 46th Academy Awards, but didn't receive a nomination.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Plot Moti (Amitabh Bachchan) is a \\"gur\\" (unrefined concentrated cane sugar) trader who trades in the seasonal Gur made of \\"Khajur\\" (date- nectar). During the offseason, he meets a girl, Phoolbanu, and falls in love with her. Moti approaches Phoolbanu's father, who asks for mehar (Bride price), which he does not have. Majubee(Nutan), a widow who is Moti's business associate prepares the Gur for him to sell. Her Gur (and consequently Moti's) is very famous and people always prefer to buy from Moti. Moti decides to marry Majubee so that he does not have to pay her, and hence can save more and sooner. Majubee, unaware of Moti's ulterior motive, is first surprised by the proposal, but later accepts it. At the end of the season, Moti saves enough for the meher and divorces Majubee. This incident shocks Majubee and people of the community. Moti meets Phoolbanu's father and asks again for his daughter's hand. Satisfied with the meher, he marries off his daughter (Phoolbanu) to Moti. All is fine till the Gur season arrives. Phoolbanu is terrible at making Gur, and Moti's customers stop buying from his shop. Meanwhile, a fish trader (Majhi) asks Majubee to marry him. He is honest with her to say that he has small children and wants Majubee to look after them. He always treats her with courtesy. It is almost the end of the Gur season, and Moti does not make a good profit that year. He finally is left with no other option than to request Majubee to make a few vats of Gur for him to sell. He takes two cans of date- nectar and approaches Majubee at her husband's house to request her to make him some Gur to sell. He is followed by Phoolbanu. At first, Majubee is very angry on seeing Moti but understands that he is in a pitiful condition and is indirectly begging her forgiveness. She also sees Phoolbanu listening to everything from behind a fence. As the eyes of the two ladies meet, they start weeping and hug each other affectionately.

L.L.C., more than 450 items of stolen construction equipment were reported to Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association in 2008 in Japan alone. In the United States, the National Insurance Crime Bureau estimated that by 2007 more than $1 billion in construction equipment was stolen each year. In the United Kingdom, according to the 2009 Equipment Theft Report, published by the National Plant & Equipment Register, the most commonly stolen items in that country in 2008 were trailers (911 thefts), excavators (849), site dumpers (244) and telehandlers (202). The biggest increases in thefts were in agricultural tractors (up 149 percent), quad bikes (up 83 percent), forklift trucks (up 67 percent), and portable generators (up 55 percent). TER manager Tim Purbrick said organized criminals found construction theft very lucrative. Anti-theft measures As of 1998, the Home Depot chain of stores, which rent construction equipment, implemented two policies which dramatically reduced theft, according to the company: It stopped leaving equipment in trailers, ready for hauling away, and it used tire locks rather than chains to secure equipment in place. \\"When would-be thieves see that they have to load the equipment onto a trailer, which takes extra time, makes more noise and may draw attention to their actions, they decide it's not worth the trouble,\\" Dan McAreavey, product manager for Home Depot Tool Rental for North America, told Rental Equipment Register, a business publication.Trunko, Michael, \\"Anti-Theft Systems: Jaws of a Pit Bull\\", Rental Equipment Register, February 1, 2002retrieved September 25, 2009 In the United Kingdom, the Construction Equipment Security And Registration (CESAR) and The National Plant & Equipment Register programs allow companies to register equipment to help recover stolen items. In 2008, a trend was identified in the United Kingdom in which criminals rented equipment for fake sites and then vanished once the equipment was delivered. \\"Early indications are that CESAR registered plant is up to six times more likely to be recovered than non-CESAR registered items\\", according to RSA (formerly Royal Sun Alliance), a British insurance company. RSA recommended that rental businesses be sure to identify those leasing equipment and either establish credit with customers or use credit or debit cards for payment.

It is on U.S. Route 61, to the north of St. Francisville, Louisiana. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The plantation's gardens The plantation was created by Dr. Samuel Flower, a Quaker physician who relocated from Pennsylvania during the 1770s when the area was British territory. Later, when Spain gained control (see St. Francisville, Louisiana, history), he gave medical treatment to Governor Manuel Gayoso. When Dr. Flower died in 1813, the year after Louisiana became a state, his eight heirs would divide thousands of arpents of land in the Felicianas, Rapides Parish, along Bayou Manchac, and in the Mississippi Territory. The family residence bordering Bayou Sara, appraised in the estate division at $12,300, was left to Dr. Flower's 20-year- old married daughter Harriett. Harriett Flower's husband, Judge George Mathews, was a superior court judge in the Mississippi Territory and then in the Territory of Orleans, appointed by President Thomas Jefferson. He became the chief justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court after statehood. His father, General George Mathews, was an American Revolutionary War hero who survived being bayoneted several times to become a US Congressman, military general, and two-term Governor of Georgia. Harriett and Judge George Mathews lived at Butler Greenwood and raised indigo, cotton, sugarcane, and corn, shipping the crops from their own dock on Bayou Sara and extending their landholdings to include a productive sugar plantation in Lafourche Parish that, according to Lewis Gray's figures, placed them among the top-producing 9% of sugar planters in the state in the 1850s. After the death of Judge Mathews in 1836, his widow continued to run the plantations with help from her son Charles Lewis Mathews. In the census of 1860, both Harriett and her son list their occupations as planter, their household including Charles‚Äô wife Penelope Stewart, their children, an Austrian music teacher, and an Irish gardener, with 96 slaves living in 18 dwellings and their personal estate valued at $260,000. In that year the of Butler Greenwood Plantation produced 130 bales of cotton, 2000 bushels of corn, 175 hogsheads of sugar and more than 10,000 gallons of molasses. Their other plantations covered nearly worked by some 400 slaves and were equally productive in 1860, although after the Civil War the labor force had fallen to a field gang of only 27 freedmen working for monthly wages on the home place. Today Now the home of the seventh and eighth generation of the family, author Anne Butler and her daughter Chase Poindexter, Butler Greenwood is a simple, raised cottage-style plantation house filled with oil portraits, Brussels carpet, gilded pier mirrors, Mallard poster beds, fine china and silverware, a French Pleyel grand piano, and the area's finest original Victorian formal parlor, its twelve matching pieces still in their original upholstery. The house is surrounded by formal gardens and extensive groves of live oak trees. The original detached brick kitchen dates from the 1790s, the garden gazebo from the 1850s. Butler Greenwood Plantation is open for house tours and overnight stays in bed and breakfast cottages on the plantation grounds.

Hyderabad fitted with loudspeakers. Loudspeakers were invented in the early 20th century, and they were introduced in mosques in the 1930s, where they are used by a muezzin for the adhan (\\"call to prayer\\"), and sometimes for khutbah (sermons). Outdoor loudspeakers, usually mounted on tall minarets, are used five times a day for the call to prayer, sometimes starting as early as 4 a.m. Some mosques have loudspeakers that are powerful enough to be heard as far as 5 km (3 mi) away. In areas where more than one mosque is present, the loudspeaker sounds overlap one another, especially in the early morning when sounds are more clearly heard. Loudspeakers are sometimes also used inside mosques to deliver sermons or for prayer. The first known installation of a microphone‚Äìloudspeaker set occurred in 1936 in the Masjid Sultan in Singapore; it was reported that the summons to prayer could 'carry more than a mile'. Though some mosque attendees were sceptical of this new electric system, most believed it was necessary to empower the muezzin's voice to transcend a modern city's noises. Electrically amplified adhans have become commonplace in countries such as Turkey and Morocco, whereas in others such as the Netherlands only 7 to 8% of all mosques employ loudspeakers for the call to prayer.  Legality  Limitation on calls to prayer by Muslims exist in countries including the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, the UK, Austria, Norway, and Belgium. Some cities have independently banned or restricted the use of loudspeakers by mosques, including Lagos, Nigeria, and some communities in the US state of Michigan. In November 2016, a proposal to prohibit the use of loudspeakers by religious institutions during rest hours was approved in Israel.  Opposition  The installation of outdoor loudspeakers on mosques has frequently met with opposition in communities where Islam is a minority religion, but also in Muslim-majority countries. Germany In Cologne, Germany, the proposed construction of the Cologne Central Mosque encountered strong criticism from some area residents; a ban on broadcasting the call to prayer over loudspeakers outside the building was among the first stipulations that the mosque's supporters had to agree to when seeking a building permit. India In India, noise pollution activists have called for restricting the use of loudspeakers, stating religion is not a ground to violate noise rules. In 1999, in debating a proposed blanket ban on loudspeakers atop mosques, some political leaders in India alleged that loudspeakers had been used to create communal tension, and that they had been used to incite a riot in Nandurbar, Maharashtra state, on November 10, 1999. Two mosques have been constructed close to the Mahabodhi Temple in Bihar and one mosque just behind the Bodh Gaya Mandir. The use of loudspeakers for call to prayer (Azaan) has caused disturbance to Buddhists engaged in meditation and recitation of prayers at the Bodh Gaya Temple. One writer said, \\"it may be time to pose the question publicly: since Bodhgaya is the Buddha‚Äôs place of Enlightenment, shouldn‚Äôt Muslims be sensitive to Buddhist feelings?\\". Indonesia Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has recognized that the overzealous use of sound amplification by its many mosques is an environmental issue and appears to be taking official measures to curb the problem. However, in August 2018, a woman who complained of the volume of her local mosque's speakers was eventually given an 18-month prison sentence for blasphemy, while mobs burned 14 Buddhist temples following the news of her complaint against the loudspeakers. As a direct response to this incident, Indonesia's Ministry of Religious Affairs issued a circular on Adhan or the Islamic call to prayer, with guidelines on when and how it ought to be broadcast by mosques. United Kingdom On 5 May 2020 Waltham Forest council, London, gave eight mosques permission to publicly broadcast its call to prayer during Ramadan.https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/05/call-prayer-broadcast-first-time- london-borough-lockdown-ramadan-12658639/ On 14 May 2020 Newham Council followed suit, granting permission to nineteen mosques within the London borough to publicly broadcast its call to prayer during ramadan.https://www.newham.gov.uk/news/article/389/newham-council-gives- permission-for-broadcast-of-muslim-call-to-prayer-during- ramadanhttps://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/mosques-to-broadcast-call-to- prayer-1-6655484 Many residents in the area of Newham, in dispute of the decision, wrote to the Mayor's office occupied by Rokshana Fiaz.

This upset many of the non-Muslim residents of the area, which has a large and long-established Polish Catholic population. Proponents pointed out that the city was already subject to loud bell ringing from the local church, while opponents argued that the church bells served a nonreligious purpose. Later that year, the city amended its noise regulations to limit the volume of all religious sounds. Prior to this, other mosques in the Detroit area had been using loudspeakers to broadcast their calls to prayer without incident.

They have more to do with the mechanisms of how people learn, remember, problem-solve, and pay attention, rather than with actual knowledge. Cognitive skills or functions encompass the domains of perception, attention, memory, learning, decision making, and language abilities. Specialisation of functions Cognitive science has provided theories of how the mind works, and these have been of great interest to researchers who work in the empirical fields of brain science. A fundamental question is whether cognitive functions, for example visual processing and language, are autonomous modules, or to what extent the functions depend on each other. Research evidence points towards a middle position, and it is now generally accepted that there is a degree of modularity in aspects of brain organisation. In other words, cognitive skills or functions are specialised, but they also overlap or interact with each other. Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, has been shown to be related to either visual or linguistic processing, depending on the task; although there are also aspects that differ from them. All in all, research evidence does not provide strong support for classical models of cognitive psychology. Cognitive functioning Cognitive functioning refers to a person's ability to process thoughts. It is defined as \\"the ability of an individual to perform the various mental activities most closely associated with learning and problem solving. Examples include verbal, spatial, psychomotor, and processing-speed ability.\\"National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorC Cognition mainly refers to things like memory, speech, and the ability to learn new information. The brain is usually capable of learning new skills in the aforementioned areas, typically in early childhood, and of developing personal thoughts and beliefs about the world. Old age and disease may affect cognitive functioning, causing memory loss and trouble thinking of the right words while speaking or writing (\\"drawing a blank\\"). Multiple sclerosis (MS), for example, can eventually cause memory loss, an inability to grasp new concepts or information, and depleted verbal fluency. Humans generally have a high capacity for cognitive functioning once born, so almost every person is capable of learning or remembering. Intelligence is tested with IQ tests and others, although these have issues with accuracy and completeness. In such tests, patients may be asked a series of questions, or to perform tasks, with each measuring a cognitive skill, such as level of consciousness, memory, awareness, problem-solving, motor skills, analytical abilities, or other similar concepts. Early childhood is when the brain is most malleable to orientate to tasks which are relevant in the person's environment.

The company sells royalty-free and rights-managed video footage and audio clips. It currently specialises in the space flight and space exploration. Archive film sourced by Footagevault formed the basis of the 2007 documentary feature film In the Shadow of the Moon and the spin off Discovery Channel series Moon Machines. Through their work on these projects and as a consultant to the series NASA's Greatest Missions the company has played a key role in the Discovery Channel‚Äôs legacy project, working to help preserve NASA's film archive. The company is located in London, England.  History  Footagevault was founded by Christopher Riley and grew from an interest he gained in archive film whilst working on the BBC landmark series The Planets; in the late 1990s when he first spent time working with NASA's film archive at both the Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Jet Propulsion Labs in Pasadena, California. Returning to this film archive after leaving the BBC, he started to supply it to other documentary film productions through his first company The Attic Room. Footagevault was formed in 2006, when streaming video was still in its infancy. The searchable web site was launched the following year to coincide with the release of the documentary feature film In the Shadow of the Moon for which the company had sourced and supplied all the NASA archive. The Apollo flight film collection had been stored under liquid nitrogen at the Johnson Space Center, since its return from the Moon in the early 1970s and only brought out a handful of times, most recently in early 2005 when NASA transferred the films onto High Definition tape. Through Footagevault, In the Shadow of the Moon was the first film production to make use of these new 2005 digital HD transfers. Since then the company has pioneered the publishing of the collection online in a fully searchable form, making it accessible for the first time in this way to historians, scholars, film makers and journalists. In an attempt to further share the Apollo film archive Footagevault has also partnered with NASA's Apollo Flight Journal setting the footage in its proper historical context within each mission. In 2009 Footagevault collaborated with the London Science Museum on a project to project this complete Apollo film archive in public for the first time. 'Apollo raw and uncut' ran through July and August 2009 in the museum's Energy Briefing Room.  Collection  Footagevault's collection currently specialises in space flight, spanning the 20th century, from Sputnik 1 and Yuri Gagarin's Vostok 1 flights to the International Space Station missions, and from the first robotic lunar missions to the most recent NASA missions to Mars and Saturn. They hold footage of most of NASA‚Äôs planetary missions from the 1960s to today and early Air Force experiments in human space flight; from Joe Kittinger‚Äôs famous high altitude parachute jumps to the first manned capsule flights into space. As part of this collection they curate an extensive collection of Earth views filmed from orbit and historic views of how computer technology supporting the missions has changed on the ground during the last 50 years.

A similar term, mean circulatory filling pressure, (MCFP) is defined as the mean pressure that exists in the combined circulatory system & pulmonary system when there is no blood motion. The value of MSP in animal experimental models is approximately 7 mm Hg. It is an indicator of how full the circulatory system is (i.e. the volume of blood in the system compared to the capacity of the system), and is influenced by the volume of circulating blood and the smooth muscle tone in the walls of the venous system (which determines the capacity of the system). MSP is measured in two ways experimentally, and as a result has two alternative naming conventions. MSFP is measured after clamping the aortic root and the great veins at point of entry to right atrium. On the other hand, MCFP is measured experimentally by briefly inducing cardiac arrest or naturally during cardiac arrest once the blood redistributes. It may also be estimated in vivo using a series of inspiratory holds when a patient is on a mechanical ventilator. It can be used to demonstrate effects of drugs on the venous tone while the circulating blood volume remains constant, or to measure haemodynamic changes during haemorrhage. Mean systemic pressure increases if there is an increase in blood volume or if there is a decrease in venous compliance (where blood is shifted from the veins to the arteries). An increase in mean systemic pressure is reflected in a shift of the vascular function curve to the right. Mean systemic pressure is decreased by a decrease in blood volume or by an increase in venous compliance (where blood is shifted from the arteries to the veins).

FABIG has become an internationally recognized body for the development and dissemination of guidance for hydrocarbon fires and explosions for offshore platforms and onshore petrochemical plants.FABIG Website, About FABIG The mission of FABIG is to disseminate knowledge and best practice and to develop guidance on the prevention and mitigation of fires and explosions and on the protection of facilities and personnel against fires and explosions.FABIG Website, FABIG Mission and Objectives FABIG Membership comprises 85 member organizations worldwide derived from the oil and gas industry and including oil and gas companies, consultants, contractors, regulators, verifiers, manufacturers and university researchers. All the supermajors are members of FABIG.FABIG Website, FABIG Members History  Article R607, FABIG Technical Newsletter Issue 49 (Special 15th Anniversary Edition), Feb 2008 On 6 July 1988, the Piper Alpha disaster claimed the lives of 167 people and destroyed the Piper Alpha platform. The accident, which is the worst offshore accident to date, drew the attention of the offshore industry and the regulators to the damage that could arise in the event of an explosion and fire on an offshore platform, and triggered changes that have shaped the current offshore regulatory and operating environment. Following the recommendations of the public inquiry led by Lord Cullen which followed Piper Alpha, the Offshore Safety Division (OSD) was created in April 1991 within the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to take responsibility for safety of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS), and the Safety Case Regulations 1992 (SCR 92) The Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992, SI 1992/2885 came into force on 30 November 1993. The SCR 92 have been the key instrument of new the goal setting regime for the UK offshore industry. The offshore industry responded to the challenges presented by the disaster through initiatives including joint industry projects sponsored by organizations with full scale fire and/or explosion tests. The first major research project that followed the Piper Alpha disaster was Phase 1 of the Joint Industry Project on Blast and Fire Engineering for Topside Structures (BFETS) that was undertaken between May 1990 and July 1991. It resulted in 26 reports that summarized the industry understanding of fire and explosion engineering and in the release of the Interim Guidance Notes (IGN). These guidelines were called \\"interim\\" due to fast changing design concepts and the numerous gaps in understanding of loading and resistance to explosion and fire that were highlighted in BFETS Phase 1. FABIG was created within this context of research and change of the offshore industry in March 1992, with a view to continue the dissemination of information on hydrocarbon fires and explosions and be the main forum for discussion of fire and blast issues. The FABIG activities have been running since 1992. The topics covered by FABIG has expanded to cover onshore fire and explosion issues as well as human factors, integrity management of ageing assets, LNG and hydrogen. Activities FABIG activities are aimed at practitioners involved in the design, operation and inspection of offshore installations and onshore petrochemical plants. FABIG organizes Technical Meetings and publishes Technical Notes and Technical Newsletters for the dissemination of knowledge and best practice on fire and explosion issues. Technical meetings FABIG has organized more than 55 technical meetings comprising presentations from industry experts covering fire and explosion issues such as design of structures and equipment against fires and explosions, risk assessment, mitigation systems, fire and explosion modelling, dispersion modelling, human factors, integrity management of ageing assets, compliance with regulations, LNG, key performance indicators, etc.FABIG Website FABIG Technical Meeting Reviews The results of the Joint Industry Project Phase 1 on the Buncefield Explosion Mechanism were disseminated for the first time at the FABIG Technical Meeting of June 2009.

A private home, it is open, by prior arrangement, for exclusive-use events and accommodation. It is north-east of the village of Kincardine O'Neil, and east of Aboyne on the north side of the River Dee, Aberdeenshire. History Kincardine Castle The castle was built in 1894-6 to Scots Baronial designs by Niven and Wigglesworth of London. David Barclay Niven trained in Dundee and moved to the office of Sir Aston Webb in London where he swiftly became principal designer at the time Webb was working on designs for the Victoria and Albert Museum. Webb later went on to design notable London buildings including Admiralty Arch, The Mall and the principal facade of Buckingham Palace. Herbert Hardy Wigglesworth trained in Aberdeen under Alexander Marshall Mackenzie before moving to the London office of Ernest George and Peto. The architects set up in business together and Kincardine Castle was their first major commission. They were influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and this shows in the design which incorporates features from five centuries of building styles. The building is essentially an essay on architecture. The entrance tower hints back to a 14th century keep with its plain rendered walls, battlement and cap house. There's even a high- level door half hidden by the ornate portico. The addition of windows in the SW face of this tower in the 1930s somewhat detracted from the intended effect. Another tower consists of twin drum towers corbelled to the square and back again to round turrets and these twin towers are linked with an arch - the whole is similar in effect to the Seaton Tower at Fyvie Castle from 1599. While the building has five circular turrets it also has one square turret very similar in style to those at Crathes Castle (late 16th Century). Much of the remainder of the building reflects fairly standard Scottish Baronial architecture from 17th and 18th centuries. The rear elevation of the building is the plainest and more akin to the work of Charles Rennie Macintosh though the architects retained crow-stepped gables and as a result the property doesn't leak as disastrously as Macintosh's Hill House. It is a category B listed building. The house was built on the site of, and incorporating part of, an earlier building called Kincardine Lodge, dating from around 1780. Around 1900, T. H. Mawson discussed the possibility of planning gardens, but no plans were produced. At the heart of a estate, the castle is not open to the public, but serves as a venue for meetings, private dining, marquee events and weddings. There are extensive gardens including a Walled Garden, Planetary Garden and Wilderness which are open for one day in June under the Scotland's Gardens scheme and at Pop-up events such as the regular First Friday caf√© held on the 1st Friday of each month (except August). In 2016 Kincardine Castle featured on an episode of Oighreachdan na h-Alba/Great Estates, a BBC Alba documentary series taking an in-depth look at the workings of country estates.

Until annexation in 1898, Hawaii was an independent sovereign state, recognized by the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany with exchange of ambassadors. However, there were several challenges to the reigning governments of the Kingdom and Republic of Hawaii during the -year (1887‚Äì1895) period. Rebellion of 1887 King KalƒÅkaua In 1887, a group of cabinet officials and advisors to King KalƒÅkaua and an armed militia forced the king to promulgate what is known by its critics as the \\"Bayonet Constitution\\". The impetus behind the imposition of the 1887 constitution was the frustration amongst members of the Reform Party (also known as the Missionary Party) with the growing debt of the Kingdom, the spending habits of the King, and general governance of the Kingdom. It was specifically triggered by an ill-fated attempt by Kalakaua to create a Polynesian Federation under his rule, and a bribery scandal Kalakaua was involved in regarding opium licenses. \\"For instance, in 1887 he was accused of accepting a bribe of $71,000\\", footnote 73 \\"The opium scandal and fragmentary news concerning the Samoan embassy led to unprecedented criticism and unrest by a political opposition that had by this time gone far beyond venting its dissatisfaction through political action.\\" The 1887 constitution stripped the monarchy of much of its authority, imposed significant income and property requirements for voting, and completely disenfranchised all Asians from voting.Russ, The Hawaiian Revolution, p. 20. Only well-to-do Europeans, Americans and native Hawaiians were given full voting rights. When KalƒÅkaua died in 1891 during a visit to San Francisco, his sister Liliuokalani assumed the throne. Native Hawaiians on the other hand, according to Queen Liliuokalani in her autobiography, called her brother's reign \\"a golden age materially for Hawaii\\" and felt that the new constitution was imposed by a minority of the foreign population because of the king's refusal to renew the Reciprocity Treaty, which now included an amendment that would have allowed the US Navy to have a permanent naval base at Pearl Harbor in O'ahu, and the king's foreign policy. According to bills submitted by the King to the Hawaiian parliament, the King's foreign policy included an alliance with Japan and supporting other Malay countries suffering from colonialism. Native Hawaiians were deeply opposed to a permanent US military presence in their country. At the time of the Bayonet Constitution of 1887 Grover Cleveland was president, and his secretary of state Thomas F. Bayard sent written instructions to the American minister George W. Merrill that in the event of another revolution in Hawaii, it was a priority to protect American commerce, lives and property. Bayard specified, \\"the assistance of the officers of our Government vessels, if found necessary, will therefore be promptly afforded to promote the reign of law and respect for orderly government in Hawaii.\\" In July 1889, there was a small scale rebellion, and Minister Merrill landed Marines to protect Americans; the State Department explicitly approved his action. Merrill's replacement, minister John L. Stevens, read those official instructions, and followed them in his controversial actions of 1893. Charles S. Campbell, The Transformation of American Foreign Relations: 1865‚Äì1900 (1976), pp. 178‚Äì79. Rebellion of 1888 A plot by Princess Liliuokalani was exposed to overthrow King KalƒÅkaua in a military coup. Rebellion of 1889 In 1889, a rebellion of Native Hawaiians led by Colonel Robert Wilcox and Robert Boyd attempted to replace the hated Bayonet Constitution and stormed 'Iolani Palace. The rebellion was later crushed. The United States landed Marines to protect American interests, an action later officially endorsed by the State Department. Charles S. Campbell, The Transformation of American Foreign Relations: 1865‚Äì1900 (1976), pp. 178‚Äì79. Rebellion of 1892 A plot by Native Hawaiians led by Colonel Robert Wilcox attempted to overthrow the monarchy. Coup d'√©tat of 1893 According to Queen Liliuokalani in her autobiography, Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen, immediately upon ascending the throne, she received petitions from 2/3 of her subjects and the major Native Hawaiian political party in parliament, Hui KƒÅlaiƒÅina, asking her to proclaim a new constitution. Believing her actions were supported by both her cabinet and her Native Hawaiian subjects, Liliuokalani drafted a new constitution that would restore the monarchy's authority and strip American and European residents of the suffrage they had obtained in 1887 by threat of force against King Kalakaua. In response to Liliuokalani's attempt to promulgate a new constitution, a group of European and American residents formed a \\"Committee of Safety\\" on January 14, 1893 in opposition to the Queen and her plans. After a mass meeting of supporters, the Committee committed itself to the removal of the Queen, and seeking annexation to the United States.The Morgan Report, p. 817. \\"There was talk at the meeting of the committee at W.R. Castle's, on the next (Sunday) morning, of having resolutions abrogating the monarchy and pronouncing for annexation, offered at the mass meeting;\\" United States Government Minister John L. Stevens Follow the explicit policy that it been laid out by President Cleveland's Secretary of State back in 1887, on the need to use American military forces to protect American interests in Hawaii during a revolutionary episode. Campbell, The Transformation of American Foreign Relations: 1865‚Äì1900 (1976), pp. 178-79. Stevens summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the U.S.S. Boston and two companies of U.S. sailors to land on the Kingdom and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. This deployment was at the request of the Committee of Safety, which claimed an \\"imminent threat to American lives and property\\". The Royal military and police forces made no effort whatever to interfere, to stop the revolution, or to protect the Queen. Historian William Russ states, \\"the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.\\" A provisional government was set up with the strong support of the Honolulu Rifles, a militia group which had defended the Kingdom against the Wilcox rebellion in 1889. Under this pressure, Liliuokalani gave up her throne to the Committee of Safety. The Queen's statement yielding authority, on January 17, 1893, also pleaded for justice: : I Liliuokalani, by the Grace of God and under the Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the Constitutional Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional Government of and for this Kingdom. : That I yield to the superior force of the United States of America whose Minister Plenipotentiary, His Excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared that he would support the Provisional Government. : Now to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life, I do this under protest and impelled by said force yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall, upon facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representatives and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the Constitutional Sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands. Despite repeated claims that the overthrow was \\"bloodless\\", the Queen's Book notes to the contrary that Lilu'okalani received \\"friends [who] expressed their sympathy in person; amongst these Mrs. J. S. Walker, who had lost her husband by the treatment he received from the hands of the revolutionists. He was one of many who from persecution had succumbed to death.\\" An immediate investigation into the events of the overthrow was commissioned by President Cleveland and conducted by former Congressman James Henderson Blount. The Blount Report was completed on July 17, 1893 and concluded that \\"United States diplomatic and military representatives had abused their authority and were responsible for the change in government.\\"Ball, Milner S. \\"Symposium: Native American Law,\\" Georgia Law Review 28 (1979): 303. Minister Stevens was recalled, and the military commander of forces in Hawaii was forced to resign his commission. President Cleveland stated \\"Substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character as well as the rights of the injured people requires we should endeavor to repair the monarchy.\\" Cleveland further stated in his 1893 State of the Union Address and that, \\"Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our Government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention.\\" Submitting the matter to Congress on December 18, 1893, after President Sanford Dole refused to reinstate the Queen on Cleveland's command, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under Chairman Morgan, continued investigation into the matter. On February 26, 1894, the Morgan Report was submitted, contradicting the Blount Report and finding Stevens and the U.S. troops \\"not guilty\\" of any involvement in the overthrow. The report asserted that, \\"The complaint by Liliuokalani in the protest that she sent to the President of the United States and dated the 18th day of January, is not, in the opinion of the committee, well founded in fact or in justice.\\"Reports of Committee on Foreign Relations 1789-1901 Volume 6 (The Morgan Report), p. 385. After submission of the Morgan Report, Cleveland ended any efforts to reinstate the monarchy, and conducted normal diplomatic relations with the Provisional Government and later, the Republic of Hawaii. He rebuffed further entreaties from the Queen to intervene further in the matter. The Republic of Hawaii was established July 4, 1894 under the presidency of Sanford Dole. Black Week Although not a rebellion, the Black Week was a near-war event directly related to the Hawaiian rebellions. United States Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens was forced to retire after supporting the overthrow of the monarchy. He was replaced by James Henderson Blount. After completing the Blount Report, Blount was replaced by Albert S. Willis. Willis, despite the America‚Äôs neutrality toward Hawaii, threatened an amphibious invasion to force the Provisional Government to restore the Queen. The threat failed to restore the monarchy, but did prolong annexation. Rebellion of 1895 In 1895, a counter-rebellion led by Colonel Samuel Nowlein, Minister Joseph Nawahi, members of the Royal Household Guards, and later Robert Wilcox attempted to overthrow the Republic of Hawaii and restore the monarchy, and led to the conviction and imprisonment of the former Queen Liliuokalani and dissolution of the exiled royal government. According to A History of Hawaii by Professor Ralph Kuykendall, the 1895 counter-rebellion was also heavily financed by Chinese and Japanese immigrants, who had felt some loyalty to Queen Liliuokalani.

He received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 1967 and a Ph.D. in Mechanics and Material Sciences from Johns Hopkins University in 1974.  Academic career  Dr. Chih-Ming Ho started his career at the University of Southern California (USC) in 1975 and rose to the rank of full professor. In 1991, he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles to lead the university's establishment of the micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) field, while serving as the founding Director of the Center for Micro Systems. He held the Ben Rich-Lockheed Martin Professor Chair until he retired in 2016, and currently is a UCLA Distinguished Research Professor. Ho was the Director of the NASA supported Institute for Cell Mimetic Space Exploration and the Center for Cell Control at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. He served as UCLA Associate Vice Chancellor for Research from 2001 to 2005.  Research accomplishments   Control of turbulent flows  Ho was the first to introduce the idea of actively perturbing the free shear layer with subharmonics of its Kelvin-Helmholtz instability frequency for increasing the entrainment of the ambient fluid into the jet stream[2,3]. Furthermore, with an elliptic jet of small aspect ratio, he found that the entrainment of the elliptic jet can be up to five times higher than that of a round jet at a passive control mode[4]. Ho applied micro shear stress sensor arrays to detect the turbulent separation line at the leading edge of airfoil and used micro actuators to produce asymmetric separation vortices, such that the aircraft can be maneuvered in rolling, pitching and yawing modes[5,6]. These innovative flow control technologies made him a global front-runner in aerodynamics during the 1980s.  Microfluidics  In early 1990s, Ho was among the pioneers of studying flows inside microfluidic channels[7,8] and micro bio-molecular sensors[9,10]. Microfluidic devices are in the dimension of microns, which match the cell sizes, such that only a minute amount of bio sample is needed for analysis. With surface molecular modifications, amperometric sensors can detect DNA/RNA even without PCR amplification in 2000s[9]. In addition, because the electrokinetic forces also work in the micro/nano scale range, it became possible to detect single molecules in microfluidic device[10]. These bio-marker sensors can have ultrasensitivities in body fluids, blood, saliva and urine[11].  AI personalized medicine  Almost all diseases are treated by combinatorial drugs. However, M drugs with N doses for each drug constitute a huge search space of NM possible combinations. In addition, the interactions among drug molecules and omics mechanisms are an insurmountable maze. Around 2010, Ho applied the mechanism independent artificial intelligence analysis and discovered that drug-dose inputs are correlated with phenotypic outputs with a Phenotypic Response Surface (PRS)[12,13,14], which is governed by a second order algebraic equation. The coefficients of the second order algebraic equation can be determined by a small number of calibration tests. Hence, the AI-PRS equation in turn eliminates the need for big data training set for AI analysis, which is not feasible in in vivo tests, especially in clinical setting. AI-PRS is an indication agnostic and mechanism free platform technology, which has been successfully demonstrated in about 30 diseases, including cancers[15,16], infectious diseases[17,18] and organ transplants[19]. The AI-PRS platform can realize unprecedented levels of adaptability to identify the optimized drug combination for a specific patient, even if dynamic changes to the regimen and dose/drug optimization are needed on a continuous basis[15,19].  Honors and awards  Ho was ranked by Thomson Reuters ISI as one of the top 250 most cited researchers in all engineering categories (2001-2014). In 1997, Dr. Ho was inducted as a member of the National Academy of Engineering. In the next year, he was elected as an Academician of Academia Sinica. Ho has received a Doctor of Engineering Honoris Causa from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and he holds ten honorary professorships, including the Einstein Professorship from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Ho was elected a Fellow of American Physics Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Services in Professional Communities In services to professional societies. Ho was a Chair of the Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD) for the American Physical Society, which is the platform in the United States for scientists interested in fundamental fluid dynamics. He was on the advisory board for the AIAA Journal and is a member of the IEEE/ASME coordinating Committee of Journal of MEMS. He was an Associate Editor of the ASME Journal of Fluids Engineering and an Associate Editor of the AIAA Journal. He also has served as a Guest Editor for the Annual Review of Fluid Dynamics. He also has chaired or served on many advisory or organizing committees of international conferences on high technology topics. Ho has served on advisory panels to provide assistance to China, France, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, on the developments of nano/micro technologies.  Industrial participation  Ho is a co-founder of GeneFluidics, which specializes in rapid PCR-less molecular based identification of pathogen- specific sequence.

The Revolution culminated in the territorial elections of 1954 where the long reign of the Hawaii Republican Party in the legislature came to an abrupt end, as they were voted out of the office to be replaced by members of the Democratic Party of Hawaii. The strikes by the Isles' labor workers demanded similar pay and benefits to their Mainland counterparts. The strikes also crippled the power of the sugarcane plantations and the Big Five Oligopoly over their workers. Prelude Asian plantation workers filling bags of sugar during the 1910s. Hawaii had a dominant-party system since the 1887 revolution. The 1887 Bayonet Constitution took most of the power away from the monarchy and allowed the Republican Party to dominate the legislature. Besides a brief change of power to the Home Rule Party following annexation, the Republicans had run the Territory of Hawaii. The industrialist Republicans formed a powerful sugar oligarchy, the Big Five. During the controversial Kahahawai murder and trial Republicans displayed their power by reducing the 10-year sentence for manslaughter to one hour. Many felt the trial was a failure of justice from political forces. But this was not the only case of the government‚Äôs abuse of power; past misdeeds were mainly centered around economic gain. Among the unhappy residents of Hawaii was John A. Burns, a police officer during the trial. Burns founded a movement by collecting support from the impoverished sugar plantation workers. He also restored strength to the divided and weak Democratic Party of Hawaii. ILWU The Hilo Longshoremen led by Jack Kawano began unified strikes in the 1930s. The Hilo Longshoremen merged with the ILWU, and Jack Wayne Hall was sent to Hawaii. Among these unified strikes was the disastrous 1938 strike in Hilo against the Inter-Island Steamship Company. During World War II striking was put on hold as the members dedicated their efforts towards the war. In 1944 the ILWU and Communist Party of Hawaii put their support behind the Democratic Party since it became apparent that Burns and his movement wanted to empower the working class. This meeting in 1944 has been considered the beginning of the movement. The movement became known as the \\"Burns Machine\\". Burns admitted in 1975 that Communist Party members in the ILWU provided vital experience in maintaining secrecy and organizing support among labor workers while keeping the early movement underground. Japanese laborers on Maui harvesting sugar cane in 1885. After the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy by a group of foreign and local residents, the members were not restrained in industrializing the Islands, forming plantations and the Big Five. Economic inequality increased, largely caused by the hyper-concentration of wealth among the planters. On the plantations earlier strikes had failed, as when an ethnic camp went on strike the other ethnic groups' camps acted as strikebreakers; the traditional example was the Japanese and Filipino camps' rivalry. The next generation of workers were children of the immigrant workers, born in Hawaii: Niseis, were a major demographic factor in favor of the movement. Many immigrant workers were denied citizenship but could live and work in the islands under contract. The children of these workers who were born in Hawaii automatically became citizens and at this time they began to come of age to be registered voters and could express their dissatisfaction with their votes. They also had gone to school with children from the other ethnic camps and sometimes intermarried them, and therefore did not express the strong ethnic rivalries that their parents had. After the meeting in 1944, Jack Hall began organizing these plantation workers in a strike campaign known as the March Inland for better working conditions and pay. After the war, Burns was able to gain support from Japanese American veterans of the 100th and 442nd returning home. He encouraged the veterans to become educated under the G.I. Bill and to run for public office. Daniel Inouye, who would become a very prominent US senator, is considered the first of the veterans he recruited and was a prominent member of the movement. March Inland Hall and Kawano's strikes resumed after the war. The ILWU helped to organize the plantation workers spreading unionization from the sea to the land. This allowed the movement to organize general strikes in the sugar industry and pineapple industry, not just strikes at the docks. The Hawaiian sugar strike of 1946 was launched against the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association and the Big Five leaving the cane fields derelict. The 1947 Pineapple Strike followed on Lanai but ended in failure and was tried again in 1951. The 1949 Hawaiian Dock Strike froze shipping in Hawaii for 177 days, ended with the territorial Dock Seizure Act. Native Hawaiians Native Hawaiians were on both sides of the Revolution; they were at the time in a social limbo in having less power and rights than Hawaiians of European descent but more than Hawaiians of East Asian descent. Older Native Hawaiians tended to fear the change would further decline their status, while youths embraced the prospect of gain by ousting the status quo. House Un-American Activities Committee As the movement developed the more communist components began to show through. The strikes were increasingly politicized and at the 1949 strike the White Republican aristocracy who were owners in the Big Five became concerned over the communist trend by workers. On October 7, after the 1949 dock strike that year, the territorial legislature requested the House Un-American Activities Committee to investigate the strikes that had become frequent in the territory. On August 28, 1951, the FBI rounded up seven members of the movement including Jack Wayne Hall, Charles Fujimoto (chairman of the Communist Party of Hawaii), and Koji Ariyoshi (editor of the Honolulu Record), who had also published pro-communist work. The Hawaii 7 were charged under the Smith Act for conspiring to overthrow the government; all were released by 1958. Political elections and reforms In the 1950 Democratic Convention John A. Burns was elected chairman of the convention and decided that the Party was ready for a strong push at the 1950 elections. But with its progress, the party was dividing into two factions: the right-wing \\"Walkout\\" who opposed Burns and the left-wing \\"Standpat\\" members who supported Burns. Among the Standpats was John H. Wilson, the founder of the Democratic Party of Hawaii himself, although he did not always agree with Burns, allied with him. With the fracture of the conservative members, the party began to slide farther leftward. Burns wished to re-establish the party ideology as Center- Left. He had Party members sign an affidavit pledging their loyalty to the Democratic Party and not the Communist Party, to deflect communist criticisms and keep the far left in check. During this time communists refrained from discussing their ideology. The rivalry between the two halves of the Democratic Party lead to several defeats in the elections against the Republicans. Leading up to the 1954 elections the Walkout faction had collapsed into smaller factions proving no threat to the Standpat faction, who effectively took over the party. So during the 1954 territorial elections, the Democrats took 11 seats in the legislature, seating a total of 22, while the Republicans had just eight. The Democrats began to reform the government installing a progressive tax, land reform, environmental protections, comprehensive health insurance plan and expanded freedoms of collective bargaining. President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Republican Samuel Wilder King as governor. King acted as an obstructionist by using the veto 71 times during his administration. Burns commented that during these times the Democrats were more focused on building the Democratic government rather than running it. Following Statehood, Burns - who, until then, had lost his elections - was elected Governor of Hawaii. The strike campaign by the ILWU continued until 1958 when another large sugar strike called the Aloha Strike took place from February 1 to June 6 and ended the campaign. Statehood Copy of official ballot (inset) and referendum results approving Admission Act. Statehood for Hawaii failed to gain much support in Congress until 1953 when the United States House of Representatives passed a statehood bill (which did not become law). Burns attempted to collaborate with Alaska, which was also pressing to become a state.Whitehead, John S. Completing the Union: Alaska, Hawai‚Äôi, and the Battle for Statehood.

Symptoms, which are extrapyramidal in nature, progress slowly and generally do not become apparent until adulthood. These symptoms include chorea, dystonia, and cognitive deficits which worsen with age. This disorder is autosomal dominant and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the light chain subunit of the ferritin protein. Wild type ferritin functions as a buffer for iron, sequestering it and controlling its release. Thus, mutations in the light chain of ferritin result in the accumulation of iron in the brain which can be imaged using MRI. Currently, neuroferritinopathy is the only neurodegenerative disease with an iron accumulation in the brain classified as an autosomal dominant syndrome. Treatment of neuroferritinopathy is focused on managing symptoms associated with chorea and dystonia using standard medications for each. The disorder is progressive and symptoms become worse with age. Fewer than 100 cases of neuroferritinopathy have been reported since its identification in 2001. Its incidence has been largely localized to Northeast England suggesting a founder effect. Due to its genetic nature, current research is focused on therapeutic management of the symptoms caused by the disorder. Signs and symptoms Neuroferritinopathy has several distinguishing signs and symptoms. These fall into two categories: diagnostic findings and physically visible symptoms. Diagnostic findings Symptoms categorized as medically tested and diagnosed include iron accumulation in the brain, basal ganglia cavitation, and neurodegeneration. Patients who are diagnosed with neuroferritinopathy have abnormal iron accumulation in the brain within the neurons and glia of the striatum and cerebellar cortices. Along with the accumulation of iron in the brain, neuroferritinopathy typically causes severe neuronal loss as well. Secondary symptoms may also arise. It is possible that the initial iron accumulation will cause additional neuronal damage and neuronal death. The damaged neurons may be replaced by other cells in an effort to reverse the neurodegeneration. These cells often have a higher iron content. The breakdown of the blood brain barrier may also occur due to the loss of neurons and will subsequently allow more iron to access the brain and accumulate over time. Neuroferritinopathy is mainly seen in those who have reached late adulthood and is generally seen to slowly progress throughout many decades in a lifetime with the mean age of onset being 39 years old. A loss of cognition is generally only seen with late stages of the disease. Diagnosed patients are seen to retain most of their cognitive functioning until the most progressive stages of the illness sets in. Physical symptoms Symptoms categorized as physically visible symptoms include chorea, dystonia, spasticity, and rigidity, all physical symptoms of the body associated with movement disorders. The symptoms accompanying neuroferritinopathy affecting movement are also progressive, becoming more generalized with time. Usually during the first ten years of onset of the disease only one or two limbs are directly affected. Distinctive symptoms of neuroferritinopathy are chorea, found in 50% of diagnosed patients, dystonia, found in 43% of patients, and parkinsonism, found in 7.5% of patients. Full control of upper limbs on the body generally remains until late onset of the disease. Over time, symptoms seen in a patient can change from one side of the body to the opposite side of the body, jumping from left to right or vice versa. Another route that the physically visible symptoms have been observed to take is the appearance, disappearance, and then reappearance once more of specific symptoms. While these symptoms are the classic indicators of neuroferritinopathy, symptoms will vary from patient to patient. Causes Neuroferritinopathy results from abnormal brain iron accumulation. This iron accumulation is due to mutations in the FTL polypeptide, which is responsible for encoding proteins involved in iron metabolism. Neuroferritinopathy is most commonly caused by a single insertion of the nucleotide adenine into the gene for L-chain ferritin which in turn, alters the carboxyl end of the entire protein chain. However, exact location of the insertion in the exon varies by family. Neuroferritinopathy may also be caused by the insertion of two extra nucleotide bases. The insertion of bases into the L-chain ferritin gene causes the chain to lengthen and alter the sequence of the amino acids found in the gene, also known as a frameshift mutation. These mutations result in decreased iron-binding ability. The oxidative damage caused by increased iron leads to apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Accumulation of iron in the brain is extremely dangerous as excess iron catalyzes the formation of free radicals, which have damaging effects to the brain. The iron accumulation characteristic of neuroferritinopathy particularly affects the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex regions of the brain. Mechanism The protein ferritin functions to sequester and release iron, acting as an iron buffering system in cells. Iron is essential to brain function in oxygen transport and cellular metabolism for example. However, careful control of iron is important as increased brain iron levels catalyze the formation of free radicals that create oxidative molecules via the Fenton Reaction. These oxidative molecules can cause oxidative brain damage. Iron that is bound to ferritin in nonreactive. Fenton Reaction (1) Fe2+ \\\\+ H2O2 ‚Üí Fe3+ \\\\+ HO‚Ä¢ + OH‚àí (2) Fe3+ \\\\+ H2O2 ‚Üí Fe2+ \\\\+ HOO‚Ä¢ + H+ The ferritin protein is made up of heavy chain (H) and light chain (L) subunits. In neuroferritinopathy, the gene encoding the light chain is mutated. Several different mutation variations have led to diagnosis as neuroferritinopathy; all of these mutations occur in the light chain. A mutated light chain is believed to inhibit ferritin‚Äôs ability to effectively sequester and hold iron. Without control of iron, it is free to cause oxidative brain damage as described above. The concentration of iron in a healthy brain varies greatly from region to region. The specific regions of the brain that are associated with motor functions appear to have larger accumulations of iron than non- motor-related regions. This observation of varying iron concentrations is a possible explanation for the correlation between movement disorders and the iron imbalance within the central nervous system. Diagnosis Neuroferritinopathy is primarily diagnosed in older adults, specifically in adults affected by Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, as iron accumulates in the brain over long periods of time. Neuroferritinopathy is diagnosed using either neuroimaging techniques, physiological tests, or genetic testing. Classification All brain iron disorders were previously labeled pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration formerly known as Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, after the scientists who first discovered individuals with abnormal iron levels in 1922 (subsequently renamed after discovering their Nazi party ties). Brain iron disorders are now divided into three categories: genetic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, genetic systemic iron accumulation with neurologic features, and acquired diseases associated with iron excess or iron deficiency. Neuroferritinopathy is classified under the first category, genetic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Neuroferritinopathy is classified as a late-onset basal ganglia disease and is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease. Four different alleles are responsible for neuroferritinopathy. Three arise from nucleotide insertions in the ferritin light chain (FTL) polypeptide gene while the fourth arises from a missense mutation in the FTL gene. Neuroimaging MRI Neuroferritinopathy is most commonly diagnosed using MRI and other neuroimaging techniques. MRIs help identify the iron deposits in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex common to neuroferritinopathy. MRIs of affected individuals also show mild cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, or tissue breakdown, and gas cavity formation in the putamen. Most importantly, the MRIs show misfolded ferritin proteins and iron deposits in the glial cells of the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and purkinje cells, causing neuronal death in these areas. Physiological testing Blood tests usually come back normal in affected individuals, so they do not serve as a reliable means of diagnosis. Blood tests can show low serum ferritin levels. However, this is unreliable as method of diagnosis, as some patients show typical serum ferritin levels even at the latest stages of neuroferritinopathy. Cerebral spinal fluid tests also are typically normal. Ferritin aggregates found in the skin, liver, kidney, and muscle tissues may help in diagnosing neuroferritinopathy. More cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers are also often found in the muscle biopsies of affected individuals. Genetic testing Genetic testing can confirm a neuroferritinopathy diagnosis. A diagnosis can be made by analyzing the protein sequences of affected individuals and comparing them to known neuroferritinopathy sequences. Treatment Due to neuroferritinopathy‚Äôs genetic etiology, the disorder is not currently curable. Furthermore, progression of the disorder is unable to be effectively halted. Therefore current treatment focuses on managing symptoms of the disorder. No medication is available to treat all symptoms. Botox has been shown to help with focal dystonia. The dopamine depleter Tetrabenazine shown to help with involuntary movements. Symptoms affecting movement (dystonia) have also been treated with L-Dopa, orphenadrine, benzhexol, sulpiride, diazepam, clonazepam, and deanol. Parkinsonian symptoms were not decreased by L-Dopa. Iron supplements should be avoided. Epidemiology Map of England Neuroferritinopathy was first discovered in 2001, with its first case being reported in Cumbria from Northern England. The discovery of neuroferritinopathy was mediated by a study done on a large family suffering from a dominantly inherited basal ganglia disease. The disease was reported to be instigated by a mutation on the ferritin light chain polypeptide, (FTL1), and was found to cause iron accumulation in the brain and neurodegeneration. Following in suit of the location of the first case of Neuroferritinopathy, the majority of patients diagnosed with the disease have also been found in Northern and Northeast England. The localization of the majority of cases to Northern and Northeast England suggests that a common ancestor may be responsible for many or possibly all cases. Despite there being fewer than 100 cases reported and the disease‚Äôs general location of Northern and Northeast England, multiple more cases of neuroferritinopathy have been diagnosed around the rest of the world in recent years. Research  New potential treatment options being researched are Venesection (removing red blood cells), Iron chelation with deferiprone, and Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone).

It acts as a potent full agonist for the 5HT2A receptor. Anecdotal reports from users suggest 25B-NBOMe to be an active hallucinogen at a dose of as little as 250‚Äì500 ¬µg, making it a similar potency to other phenethylamine derived hallucinogens such as Bromo-DragonFLY. Duration of effects lasts about 12‚Äì16 hours, although the parent compound is rapidly cleared from the blood when used in the radiolabeled form in tracer doses. Recently, Custodio et. al (2019) evaluated the potential involvement of dysregulated dopaminergic system, neuroadaption, and brain wave changes which may contribute to the rewarding and reinforcing properties of 25B-NBOMe in rodents. The carbon-11 labeled version of this compound ([11C]Cimbi-36) was synthesized and validated as a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography (PET) in Copenhagen. As a 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET radioligand, [11C]Cimbi-36 was hypothesized to provide a more functional marker of these receptors. Also, [11C]Cimbi-36 is investigated as a potential marker of serotonin release and thus could serve as an indicator of serotonin levels in vivo. [11C]Cimbi-36 is now undergoing clinical trials as a PET-ligand in humans.  Toxicity and harm potential  25B-NBOMe has been used in clinical trials with an evaluation dose for safety consideration to humans of only 1 microgram. Such a dose is only 1/300th the dose expected to be hallucinogenic to humans and it is expected that recreational use would greatly exceed doses determined to be safe to humans. One case has been reported on where 25B-NBOMe was identified as the cause of death for a 17-year-old boy. The drug was also implicated in the death of an 18-year old male, however it was not reported whether the presence of the drug was confirmed postmortem. Several deaths have been attributed to its close analogue 25I-NBOMe.

It is located at the southwest corner of the intersection of Markham Road and Nugget Avenue in the former city of Scarborough. It is one of the most widely recognized Masjids in the Greater Toronto Area and has hosted many internationally renowned speakers and guests. The current imam and Director of Religious Affairs of the Masjid is Yusuf Badat. History The Islamic Foundation of Toronto was established in 1969, when an old building was purchased at Rhodes Avenue and converted into a mosque. The site, where the Islamic Foundation currently stands, was purchased in 1984. At the time, an elementary school was also conceived as an integral part of the Foundation. The majestic three-storied building in its current form, made from white stone, was completed in 1992 at a cost of about six million dollars, almost all of which was raised by the local Muslim community. A tall minaret captures the skyline, complemented by a copper-cladded dome, symbolizing the Muslim presence in Canada. The building is in area, with prayer halls for men and women, 12 classrooms, a cafeteria and kitchen, a gymnasium, a library, a mortuary, an elevator and over 200 parking spaces.http://www.islamicfoundation.ca/about_us.aspx In August 2017, the Islamic Foundation abruptly closed the high school portion of the school, leaving over 160 students scrambling to find a new school before the school year started in September. This was devastating news for hundreds of parents and children, many of whom had contributed thousands of dollars and a significant number of volunteer hours for the school. As of November 2017, the elementary and middle school portions were still open, though enrollment has significantly decreased. On March 16, 2020, all facilities were closed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic in Ontario. The foundation announced that \\"no prayers will take place until further notice\\" citing Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health's recommendation to close places of worship. Activities and organization A side view of the Masjid The Islamic Community Centre is accessible by public transportation and is open for the five daily prayers. The Friday congregation prayer is attended by almost 2,000 worshippers. The full-time school has a qualified staff with over 300 students from Junior Kindergarten to grade eight. More than four hundred students attend the evening and weekend Islamic classes. The governing body of the Islamic Foundation is an elected Majlis consisting of seven members. To ensure accountability, there is also an elected board of trustees which holds the title to the property and advises the Majlis. The audited accounts are published yearly, and the books and meetings are open to the members, as required by the constitution of the foundation. Nonetheless, the Majlis has been known to have issues with transparency and has been accused of selfish practices, especially due to the recent sudden shut down of the high school.

A network is a system whose elements are somehow connected (Wasserman and Faust, 1994).Wasserman, S., Faust, K., 1994. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY. The elements of a system are represented as nodes (also known as actors or vertices) and the connections among interacting elements are known as ties, edges, arcs, or links. The nodes might be neurons, individuals, groups, organisations, airports, or even countries, whereas ties can take the form of friendship, communication, collaboration, alliance, flow, or trade, to name a few. In a number of real-world networks, not all ties in a network have the same capacity. In fact, ties are often associated with weights that differentiate them in terms of their strength, intensity, or capacity (Barrat et al., 2004) and Horvath (2011). On the one hand, Mark Granovetter (1973) argued that the strength of social relationships in social networks is a function of their duration, emotional intensity, intimacy, and exchange of services. On the other, for non-social networks, weights often refer to the function performed by ties, e.g., the carbon flow (mg/m2/day) between species in food webs (Luczkowich et al., 2003), the number of synapses and gap junctions in neural networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998), or the amount of traffic flowing along connections in transportation networks (Opsahl et al., 2008). By recording the strength of ties, a weighted network can be created (also known as a valued network). Below is an example of such a network (weights can also be visualized by giving edges different widths): File:Weighted network.svg Weighted networks are also widely used in genomic and systems biologic applications. (Horvath, 2011).Horvath, S., 2011. Weighted Network Analysis. Applications in Genomics and Systems Biology. Springer Book. . For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) is often used for constructing a weighted network among genes (or gene products) based on gene expression (e.g. microarray) data (Zhang and Horvath 2005). More generally, weighted correlation networks can be defined by soft-thresholding the pairwise correlations among variables (e.g. gene measurements). Measures for weighted networks Although weighted networks are more difficult to analyse than if ties were simply present or absent, a number of network measures has been proposed for weighted networks: * Node strength: The sum of weights attached to ties belonging to a node (Barrat et al., 2004) * Closeness: Redefined by using Dijkstra's distance algorithm (Newman, 2001) * Betweenness: Redefined by using Dijkstra's distance algorithm (Brandes, 2001) (details) * The clustering coefficient (global): Redefined by using a triplet value (Opsahl and Panzarasa, 2009) * The clustering coefficient (local): Redefined by using a triplet value (Barrat et al., 2004) or using an algebraic formula (Zhang and Horvath 2005) A theoretical advantage of weighted networks is that they allow one to derive relationships among different network measures (also known as network concepts, statistics or indices). For example, Dong and Horvath (2007) Dong J, Horvath S (2007) Understanding Network Concepts in Modules. BMC Systems Biology 2007, June 1:24 show that simple relationships among network measures can be derived in clusters of nodes (modules) in weighted networks. For weighted correlation networks, one can use the angular interpretation of correlations to provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and to derive unexpected relationships among them Horvath and Dong (2008) Software for analysing weighted networks There are a number of software packages that can analyse weighted networks, see Social network analysis software. Among these are the proprietary software UCINET and the open-source package tnet.

Most notably, it is home to a historic collection of tree peonies collected and developed by William H. Gratwick III and Nassos Daphnis in about the 1940s-1960s. Linwood Gardens was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.  William H. Gratwick, Sr.  William Henry Gratwick, Sr. (1839-1899), was born in Albany and moved to Buffalo, NY in 1877 to found the lumber business Gratwick, White and Fryer Lumber Company, with offices in Tonawanda, Buffalo, and Detroit. The company owned timberland in Michigan and six ships to transport the timber on the Great Lakes. The Gratwick family lived at 776 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo in architect Henry Hobson Richardson's last commissioned home, an imposing brownstone, which stood until 1919. William succumbed to colon cancer in 1899, but notably was treated by Dr. Roswell Park of Buffalo during his illness. Mrs. Martha Weare Gratwick, William's widow, donated $25,000 to Dr. Park which assisted in the establishment of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, the first institution in the world to focus solely on cancer research. The remaining fortune earned by William was split among his three children, including his son, William H. Gratwick, Jr.  William H. Gratwick, Jr.  When his father died, \\"Harry\\" assisted in management of the lumber company but preferred other pursuits, including real estate projects in the Midwest and acting as Vice-President of the New York State Board of Charities. With the inheritance he also scouted out a farm property in Livingston County, New York, which proved suitable for the establishment of a summer estate, which was a popular investment for those of means. The property was purchased in 1900 and construction began shortly after. Harry worked with Green and Wicks, a prominent Buffalo firm, to design the summer house, and hired Boston landscape architect Thomas Fox to plan out the surrounding roads and garden areas between about 1901-1910. The results still stand today, with some alterations. The gardens were recognized with the Historic Landscape Award from the Landmark Society of Western New York in 2015. When Harry died in 1934, the estate was taken on by his son, William H. Gratwick III.  William H. Gratwick III  \\"Bill\\" was known as a renaissance man; some of his interests included the breeding and showing of heritage horned Dorset sheep, breeding and training Arabian horses for dressage and driving, carriages, sculpture, and local theater and musical productions. His most lasting legacy, however, is the collection of Japanese and hybrid tree peonies that are still curated at Linwood Gardens, many important varieties of which were developed at the property beginning in the 1940s. In 1938, Bill met Arthur P. Saunders, a chemistry professor and prominent American hybridizer of the tree peony. He introduced over 300 herbaceous peony varieties and over 70 varieties of tree peony in his lifetime, most notably creating distinctive yellow cultivars. Bill Gratwick worked with Saunders for a little over a decade, and imported over 100 select Japanese tree peony plants and 500 seeds from the Chugai Monastery in Japan to complement the Saunders collections. Bill carried on Saunders' work after Saunders' death in 1953, and Gratwick eventually introduced twelve of his own cultivars.  Nassos Daphnis  Born in Greece, Nassos Daphnis (1914-2010) was an American painter who met Bill Gratwick and was introduced to the world of the tree peony in the late 1930s. For most summers of his life, he visited Linwood Gardens and became deeply involved in hybridizing tree peonies as well as painting them. His 48 cultivar introductions are in tones of pink, yellow, white, mauve, and maroon and are named after figures in Greek mythology. The collection of tree peonies at Linwood Gardens reflects the cultivars that he developed on the property and his legacy.  Linwood Music School and York Opera Company  Harriet L. Saltonstall Gratwick (1907-1999) was married to William H. Gratwick III and founded the Linwood Music School in 1948, which operated until 1963. Harriet, who graduated from the Eastman School of Music, ran the school during the summer at the Gratwick Estate and offered courses in voice, piano, organ, cello, and other musical instruments. Children performed in choral concerts in the gardens, and professional musicians were invited from Rochester and Buffalo to perform free concerts for the community. Mrs. Gratwick also helped establish the York Opera Company, which put on community productions of Gilbert and Sullivan musicals.

It was the last major military operation by royalists who opposed the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Because of its brevity and lack of casualties, this conflict is largely forgotten; in some cases those who rediscover it coin a new name for the conflict, but it is frequently referred to as the ‚ÄúCounter- revolution‚Äù.  Background   Republic of Hawaii  Following the 1887 Hawaiian Constitution and the 1893 coup d'√©tat, a temporary government was formed by the Committee of Safety until an assumed annexation by the United States. They were successful with President Benjamin Harrison in negotiating an annexation treaty; however, Harrison's term in office came to an end before the treaty could be ratified by Congress. The new President, Grover Cleveland, opposed the idea of annexation, being an anti-imperialist himself, and withdrew the annexation treaty upon taking office. After commissioning the secret Blount Report, he stated that the U.S. had inappropriately used military force and called for the reinstatement of Queen Lili ªuokalani. The matter was referred by Cleveland to Congress after Sanford Dole refused Cleveland's demands, and the U.S. Senate held a further investigation, culminating in the Morgan Report, which completely rejected that there had been any U.S. involvement in the overthrow. The Provisional Government feared that President Cleveland might continue to support the queen by restoring the monarchy. The Provisional Government also realized there would be no annexation until Cleveland's term of office ended; and they wanted to establish a more permanent government until another president, more favorable toward annexation, came to office. Therefore, the Provisional Government called to order a Constitutional Convention on May 30, 1894. The Constitutional Convention drafted a constitution for a Republic of Hawaii. The Republic of Hawaii was proclaimed on 4 July 1894 at Aliiolani Hale. The Republic was a single-party oligarchy.Noenoe Silva (1998). 'The 1897 Petitions Protesting Annexation '.  Royalist plans  Sans Souci Hotel was one location the conspirators meet, run by Royalist George Lycurgus. In 1895, Robert Wilcox was brought into a plot to overthrow the Republic of Hawaii and return Queen Liliuokalani to the throne. Among the plotters was Sam Nowlein, former Head of the Royal Guards of Hawaii (which had been disbanded in 1893); Joseph Nawahi, former Minister of Foreign Affairs; Charles T. Gulick, an advisor to both KalƒÅkaua and Liliuokalani; and William H. Rickard, a sugar planter of British parentage. These men planned to attack government buildings in downtown Honolulu at night. They had recruited a number of poor Hawaiians, most of them day laborers from the outskirts of Honolulu, but failed to fill their quota of 700 recruits. In addition the recruits lacked weapons, training and discipline, and were pitted against the formidable forces of the Provisional Government, which had spent the royal treasury and secured loans to arm itself thoroughly against such an attack. The rebels had purportedly smuggled arms to Liliuokalani to resupply them once the palace was secured. A shipment of guns and ammunition from California had been smuggled on board the Schooner Wahlber to be put aboard the Steamer Waimanalo near Rabbit Island and shipped to a secret Honolulu location.  Battle of Diamond Head  Diamond Head and Waikƒ´kƒ´ beach,1890 Rumors were circulating on January 6, 1895, that armaments were being landed on Waikƒ´kƒ´ beach, Oahu. A squad of six policemen led by Captain Parker, a veteran of the 1889 rebellion who commanded the 30 Royal Guards in the Palace, had been sent to Henry Bertelmann‚Äôs house near Diamond Head to search for the weapons. They did not know Bertelmann was a Lieutenant in the insurgency. As Deputy Marshal Brown read the warrant to Bertleman, the squad was fired upon by three Royalists returning from the beach, that took shelter in Bertleman‚Äôs canoe house. The police advanced toward the canoe house until the Royalists were driven off, but not before Charles L. Carter, an armed civilian accompanying the police, was shot three times in the chest. Bertleman shot and wounded police lieutenant Holi as the policemen returned to the house. The policemen subdued Bertleman and another rebel, John Lane, in the first clash and took shelter in Bertleman‚Äôs house. 70 royalists in the surrounding area joined the battle attacking the house. They were commanded by Colonel Robert Wilcox and Lieutenant Lot Lane, an intimidating six foot Irish-Hawaiian. The Royalists surrounded the house but three men escaped: Captain Parker, Deputy Marshal Brown, and Alfred Wellington Carter (Charles Carter's cousin). The police officers mounted their horses and sent word of the uprising, while Alfred Carter searched for a doctor. A detachment of the National Guard of Hawaii, Company E commanded by Lt. King, drove back the Royalists towards Diamond Head by 9:00, allowing Alfred Carter to bring doctors Walter, Murry, and Doyle to his cousin. The battle continued into the night. The Royalists managed to repel the soldiers from their fallback position. By dawn of January 7, the government forces withdrew to Sans Souci Beach in Waikiki near Sans Souci Hotel run by Royalist George Lycurgus at Kapiolani Park west of Diamond Head and awaited reinforcements, ending the battle. C. L. Carter, nephew of supreme court justice Albert Francis Judd and son of former Kingdom diplomat Henry A. P. Carter, died from his wounds later that day. Two other police officers were also wounded and sent to a hospital. Bertleman and Lane were sent to the police station, where they were imprisoned. Although the royalists had triumphed in the first battle of the war, they had lost the element of surprise. Consequently, this victory would be short-lived.  Battle of M≈ç ªili ªili  Honolulu On January 7, 1895 martial law was declared in Hawaii by President Sanford B. Dole. The men led by Lt. Sam Nowlein rendezvoused with Col. Robert W.K. Wilcox at Diamond Head. Following the Republic government‚Äôs humiliating defeat, Marshal Edward G. Hitchcock deployed men and three artillery cannons to stop the Royalists‚Äô march on Honolulu. An additional detachment of 25 men led by Lt. Coyne was sent, and met Lt. King near Sans Souci Beach at Kapiolani Park on the east end of Waikiki. King had sent a group of men to the rim of Diamond Head to attack the Royalists from above, while Coyne had received a field piece and zeroed in on a group of 100 Royalists on the slopes of the volcano. The artillery was at first too inaccurate to be effective, and it took several barrages to dislodge Wilcox‚Äôs men. It is noted that one round was so inaccurate that it missed Diamond Head completely, sailing over the crater and landing in the sea. The final bombardment inflicted several casualties and scattered the group. Wilcox saw no tactical importance in remaining on Diamond Head and ordered his men to retreat to Waialae to rest. The new strategy was to move north into Ko ªolau mountains then west, avoiding the Government forces in south. Nowlein's men opened fire near Diamond Head at Mauumae at a group of police along Waialae Road commanded by T. B. Murray and, though they caused no casualties, the police withdrew anyway. The Republic‚Äôs army moved toward the Royalists with two of the government's cannons. The third cannon was put aboard a commandeered tugboat named Eleu to form a makeshift Patrol Boat. The Eleu attacked Wilcox‚Äôs men with grapeshot at Waialae, on the northeast side of Diamond Head. The Royalists were centered around Anton Rosa‚Äôs residence, the former headquarters for the Royalists with an arms cache, which was captured. Nowlein's men were to capture Punchbowl, but had been waiting in hiding at Mauumae as government troops were moving toward Diamond Head. T. B. Murray's group of police on reconnaissance along Waialae Road were sent toward their position. As they approached, Nowlein's men fired at them and the policemen retreated. Murray's men returned with Company F commanded by Captain C. W. Zeiler from Palolo, sent to engage Nowlein at Kaimuki as they moved toward Moiliili. Nowlein's men were driven back to Mauumae, where there were ammo caches and boulders for cover. The fighting led to a deadlock. Due to the distance between the opposing forces, and protective cover on both sides, neither combatant could inflict casualties on the other. Finally the government forces broke the stronghold when a howitzer was brought to bear to end the stalemate and 33 of Nowlein's men surrendered, though Nowlein himself escaped with officers and a few men although he disliked the idea of abandoning his men, his officers convinced him that it was strategic to prevent him from being captured or killed if he remanded in the stronghold. As the Eleu began to attack Waialae, Wilcox moved his men through the mountains, advancing toward Honolulu. His men moved to the settlement of Moiliili, at the mouth of MƒÅnoa Valley, where they encountered a line of Captain Zeiler‚Äôs Company, and also met with artillery fire. Captain Camara supported Zeiler in securing his flank, positioning his Company C in Nuuanu and Punchbowl, cutting off the western advance by the Royalists. The Royalists retreated and entrenched themselves among the stone walls and lantana foliage of the area. Zeiler advanced on them. Wilcox awaited Nowlein's attack on Punchbowl to relieve his men of the government forces, but this never came. The Royalists could not hold their ground against Zeiler's men and retreated into the valley. At the end of the battle 40 Royalists surrendered and were taken prisoner, while one of Zeiler's men was wounded. The battle had lasted a day, and several Royalists had been killed.  Battle of MƒÅnoa  National Guard Company F commanded by Captain C. W. Zeiler shortly after the Battle of MƒÅnoa MƒÅnoa Valley The final battle took place on January 9. The Royalists had withdrawn following their defeat at Moiliili. Wilcox was down to 100 men and retreated into MƒÅnoa Valley. Most of Wilcox's men had not eaten since the start of the rebellion and spirits were low. The Republican Government forces did not immediately pursue the Royalists because a riot had broken out among Japanese plantation workers in Ewa, and the government, in reaction, drew forces away from the nearly crushed rebellion to deal with this new threat. Reconnaissance patrols were sent into and around the Koolaus and concluded that the Royalist force was still in MƒÅnoa Valley. They employed the Eleu to patrol the coast and destroyed suspicious unattended boats. The government forces that remained were ordered to guard the entrance to the valley in order to keep the Royalist force contained. A Royalist force of 50 men was spotted on the evening of the 9th attempting to scale Tantalus and move through Punchbowl to enter the city. A gun battle ensued between Company A commanded by Capt. P. Smith, backed by Company D. commanded by Lt. Jones with a field piece against the Royalists, leaving one Royalist dead. The Royalists were pushed to the back of the valley where they were surrounded by mountains on three sides. Until nightfall, the doomed company withstood the ensuing siege and artillery barrage in the pocket known as ‚Äúthe Pen‚Äù, at the base of Pu ªu Konahuanui. The Royalists then climbed the steep slopes to escape under the cover of darkness. The battle had lasted three hours with two rebels captured, three confirmed dead, and most managing to escape. After the climb up the ridge the royalists‚Äô fates varied. Many felt the revolution was a failure and deserted. Others wished to continue the fight but were separated from Wilcox‚Äôs leadership and would eventually be captured or killed by government forces routing out the remaining Royalists. Wilcox moved over ancient footpaths to Nuuanu Valley and Kalihi, where the group of 10 eventually disbanded.  Aftermath  Citizens' Guards in Nuuanu Valley sent to drive out remaining insurgents Skirmishes continued for a week after the victory in MƒÅnoa as the military eradicated the areas of resistance in the Ko ªolaus. Contrary to popular belief of the tropical forests of Hawaii having excesses of edibles they are actually scarce. The early native Hawaiians brought crops of their own when they settled the islands, although vegetation is bountiful, few plants are fit for eating. As a consequence most insurgents were driven out by starvation. All the Royalist leaders were arrested. A barracks was converted into a prison to hold the captured rebels. On January 8, 1895, the captain of the Steamer Waimanalo, William Davies, and several crewmembers were arrested for distributing arms. Nowlein was caught with three lieutenants on January 14 in Moiliili. They had been fed by native Hawaiian sympathizers while in hiding. Wilcox hid for several days in the mountains and made his way to Nuuanu Valley and Kalihi with 10 loyal conspirators, but the group was disbanded. He surrendered on January 16, 1895, in a fishing hut near Kalihi. Lane hid in the Ko ªolaus above MƒÅnoa for ten days after the final battle. He came out of hiding after fighting subsided believing a foreign intervention had come, after asking a passerby he discovered the revolution was crushed. Contrary to the fears of Lane and the warning to government forces to use caution when encountering him, he surrendered peacefully to police becoming the last insurgent to be captured. After being brought to police headquarters he was escorted by six guards in fear he may overpower the regular amount for a normal prisoner. He was locked in with over a hundred under-nourished prisoners of war, he protested that night using the guards‚Äô fears about him to provide food for his fellow inmates. It was believed that most of the Royalists had evaded capture, and with their identities not known had slipped back into the community to return to their lives before the revolution. Iolani Palace throne room A weapons cache was found and attributed to Liliuokalani. She was arrested on January 16. Wilcox was tried for treason (as he had after the Wilcox Rebellion of 1889) by a military tribunal with the other military leaders. This time he was found guilty and sentenced to death, but the sentence reduced to 35 years. Liliuokalani and other political leaders were tried and convicted for misprision of treason by those who had overthrown the Kingdom. The former attorney general of the Kingdom Paul Neumann served as legal defense, and prosecutor was William Ansel Kinney. Liliuokalani formally abdicated her throne to prevent further bloodshed over the controversial government in a five-page letter on January 24, 1895. The president of the republic, Sanford B. Dole, pardoned the royalists after they served part of their prison sentence.

Because her parents thought it better for her health, she was sent to Britain and left in charge with an aunt - the Aunt Miriam of the book. They lived in Buckinghamshire and Kent before going to Sutherland, and except for a brief period in a kindergarten, all her education was undertaken by her aunt. When her aunt married and moved abroad, the author trained as a typist and took a job in an office but tried to find work outdoors during the summer months.

She later noted that she had to enter the hall alone as there was no escort system in the early years and that she had thought: \\"God, this is embarrassing\\". As the Dublin Rose, she beat four other contestants; two from the United Kingdom, one from New York City and one from Tralee. Her prize involved the presentation of trophies at the races in Tralee for one week. Her win was not broadcast on national television, as was the case in later years, but it was shown to an audience in a local parish hall. T. Ryle Dwyer's The Rose of Tralee, Fifty Years A-Blooming stated that \\"a whole entertainment ecosystem\\" involving donkeys and sheepdogs emerged from O'Sullivan's victory in the pageant. Despite this, media hype was virtually non-existent when compared to modern festivals and O'Sullivan managed to get away with claiming that her cousin had won instead of her. O'Sullivan was heavily involved in the promotion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Rose of Tralee. On 24 January 2009, she appeared alongside then Rose Aoife Kelly on Tubridy Tonight to discuss the event's fiftieth anniversary on live television. She also contributed to Five Decades of Roses, a documentary which was originally aired on 24 August 2009 and gained a 36% audience share. Upon her return as judge for the fiftieth anniversary, O'Sullivan described that year's bunch as \\"absolutely splendid and well-travelled\\" and said she was \\"astounded\\" by them. She described the judging process as \\"both interesting and challenging\\". O'Sullivan partied all night, provoking that year's winner Charmaine Kenny to say she felt like \\"a bit of a party popper\\" for having had one hour of sleep and \\"a bit of a lightweight beside her\\". O'Sullivan, instead of going to bed, then embarked on a 3 kilometre (2 mile) walk the following morning. Victoria Mary Clarke later wrote in the Sunday Independent of how O'Sullivan \\"glided glamorously through the hotel\\", commenting that \\"when I am her age, I would not object to being like her\\".

The group began as the acoustic trio of vocalist and guitarist Ash Gale as well as guitarists Jason Shepherd and Luke Zecchin, before they were joined by bassist and vocalist Jeremy Wright with drummer Suresh Meyer. The band released an extended play (EP) in 2007, entitled Including the Atmosphere. In 2008, they toured with local acts such as Thirsty Merc and went into record their debut album. They signed to Warner Music in early 2009 and released their debut single \\"Solutions\\", which peaked at number 48 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was followed up by the single \\"Drive Away\\" and tours supporting Evermore and The All-American Rejects. They released their debut studio album Fall into Place in September 2009, which peaked at number 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart. On December the 21st 2012 the band played their \\"farewell gig\\", indicating that the band is no longer together. Lead singer Ash Gale has since released three solo EP's (Roll With The Gold. Brave The Sea, and Whatever The Ending), and his song 'Sing My Way' from was released on a Jeep Grand Cherokee television advertisement across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Another of his songs, 'Sweet Release Devour' appeared on the US television show 'Shameless' In 2018 after a 6-year break, the band reunited to play at 'Handpicked Festival' in November 2018 alongside Boy & Bear, Ball Park Music, BROODS, Vera Blue and Alex Lahey. The band has also been booked to open for Dashboard Confessional in Adelaide, South Australia as part of Dashboard Confessional's 2018 \\"Good Things Festival\\" at Jive in December 2018. In January 2019 The band supported 'The Veronicas' as part of the Australia Day celebrations. History Formation and first release The origins of the band emerged from the formation of an acoustic trio in Adelaide, South Australia in 2006, involving vocalist and guitarist Ash Gale, as well as guitarists Jason Shepherd and Luke Zecchin. The band soon became a full five-piece act, with bassist and vocalist Jeremy Wright and drummer Suresh Meyer joining. The formation came about in 2006, when the members all sat together in the car park of an Adelaide shopping centre eating takeaway pizza and discussing the future of the band. The band name, The Sundance Kids, came from the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid - which the members had never even seen until early 2009. Wright is a former member of the band ThinkTank (alongside the producer of Fall into Place, Darren Thompson). In the past he had toured with Idlewild and Rancid. The band's debut release was the 2007 extended play Including the Atmosphere. They followed it up with support slots on numerous national tours with Thirsty Merc and Angelas Dish, as well as touring alongside Avalon Drive, where they would decide the headline act for each night by coin toss. Debut album: Fall into Place The Sundance Kids attracted some interest from major record labels before deciding to record their debut album on their own to ensure they had full creative control. The entire project was self-funded, with the band choosing to record with a record producer they knew, keep to a budget and back themselves to take the direction they wanted to go. It was recorded in Adelaide over a couple of months during late 2008 and early 2009, with the help of sound engineer Darren Thompson who works with a lot of interstate bands from around Australia. The band then sent the record to Los Angeles to be mixed by Brian Petrowsky. The band were eventually signed to Warner Music, with their first single \\"Solutions\\", which originally appeared on their EP, being released in May 2009. It found mainstream radio airplay and consequently peaked at number 48 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. The album's second single, \\"Drive Away\\", was released in June 2009 and also attracted mainstream radio airplay. The music video for \\"Drive Away\\" was filmed in the band's hometown of Adelaide; notably around the city's CBD, the Adelaide Hills, Aldinga Beach and McLaren Vale. The band did this to show how thankful they were for the amount of home-town support they receive; \\"We wanted to make it obvious that it was filmed in there. It's important for us that people know we're proud to come from Adelaide. We get a lot of flak about it, but we take it on the chin.\\" Following the release of the singles, they supported Evermore on their Australian tour and were the local act supporting on the sold-out tour by The All-American Rejects and Hoobastank. The album was finally manufactured eight to twelve months following the completion of production, with the finished product being made ready to hit the shelves in September 2009. Fall into Place was released through Warner and Loud and Clear Records on 4 September 2009, debuting at number 50 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. The Sundance Kids have said the album is based on what they were going through at the time of writing; it's about \\"reflecting on circumstances and the happenings of relationships with loved ones.\\" Gale has named Jeff Buckley, Keane and Damien Rice as among his influences. Whilst touring with The All- American Rejects in 2009, their lead singer Tyson Ritter described the music as 'Jeff Buckley pop'; guitarist Zecchin mentioned, \\"He called it Buckley Pop. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll live up to it, but we can try.\\" The band doesn't intend on relocating in the near future, Gale saying \\"If we were going to move anywhere at all it would be overseas, but that would be a long way in the future.\\" They are scheduled to do a headline tour to support the debut album in October 2009, with the possibility of doing some summer festivals at the end of the year.

The attacker was armed with Molotov cocktails and an axe. Fifteen people were injured in the attack, two of them severely. The attacker was also injured. Police arrived on the scene shortly after the attack began, shot the attacker, and took him into custody. Attack details The attacker entered the school building around 08:30 (UTC+1), armed with an axe, two knives and three Molotov cocktails. He hurled one of the incendiary devices into an eleventh-grade classroom, attacked a fleeing student with the axe, then threw another Molotov cocktail into a ninth-grade classroom across the hall. The student who had been attacked with an axe sustained a life- threatening concussion, another student incurred severe burns, and eleven other students as well as two teachers were lightly injured. At 08:35, an 18-year-old student notified the police, who arrived a short time later. The 18-year-old, who had been active for several years in the volunteer fire department, then began working to extinguish the fire. At this point, the attacker had locked himself in a bathroom stall. As he left the stall, he threatened the police officers with a knife. The police opened fire at 08:43, severely injuring the attacker with three shots to his arm, abdomen, and chest. Background The attacker, whom police later identified as Georg R., was 18 years old at the time of the attack and was himself a student at Carolinum. He had been undergoing psychotherapy for some time prior. He had been planning the attack intensively for months and had prepared a will. He had a date picked for the attack since the beginning of June 2009, but due to last-minute technical difficulties in preparing the Molotov cocktails he postponed the attack by a day. The police investigation later revealed that the attacker had felt unfairly treated, excluded, and unrespected; that he had been worried about passing the Abitur (university entrance exam); and that he had wished he had a girlfriend. He did not want to live anymore and had planned to be killed in the attack, and he had wanted to kill as many students and teachers as possible at the same time. No violent computer games, violent videos, or firearms were found at the attacker's home. While after previous attacks the public debate revolved mainly around changes to gun laws or laws for the protection of youth, the debate following this attack was confined to the problem of school bullying. Aftermath In reaction to the attack, the police union advocated the introduction of an early warning system for schools. Several state governments expressed a desire to increase the number of school psychologists. The German Association of Cities and Towns, in view of the attack as well as the recent death of Dominik Brunner, came out in favor of an advisory council on youth violence, based on the model of the German Immigration Council, which works in cooperation with the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. This advisory council on youth violence would develop plans for initiatives such as using the Internet for antiviolence training and increasing security in public spaces. In addition, local authorities supported greater integration among education, judicial, and youth welfare departments, as well as a safety partnership between police, municipalities, schools, and sports associations. The 18-year-old who had placed the emergency call was nominated by a classmate for the XY Prize for Civil Courage. Trial The Ansbach prosecutor's office charged the suspect, who was 19 years old at the time the trial began, with 47 counts of attempted murder, two counts of attempted manslaughter, 13 counts of grievous bodily harm, as well as attempted first-degree arson. The Ansbach District Court commenced the trial on 22 April 2010. After the charges were read, the trial was closed to the public until the pronouncement of the verdict. On 29 April 2010, the defendant was found guilty of all 47 counts of attempted murder, among other charges, and sentenced to nine years of juvenile detention. The juvenile-crime chamber of the Ansbach District Court further ordered his indefinite commitment to a psychiatric clinic.

It only saw combat once during its existence, which was assisting the Soviet Union in crushing the Prague Spring. It maintained close ties to the Warsaw Pact along with other Eastern Bloc countries. It dissolved in 1989 and retained its current form through the Hungarian Defence Force.  History  After the 1948 creation of the HPA the allies and the Soviet Union permitted it to have a 65,000 strong Army and an Air Force with 5,000 personnel and 90 aircraft. The first Minister of Defence Mih√°ly Farkas completely based the HPA off Stalinism until the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. The HPA mimicked the Soviet Army's Political commissar model, In which party members could teach the ideas of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism to soldiers of the HPA. After Stalin's death, De- Stalinization swept through the HPA quickly leading to the resignation of Farkas as Minister of Defence. In 1956 the Soviet Army invaded Hungary due to the revolutions that were taking place. As a result, the Soviets took away most of the HPA's equipment, and dismantled the Air Force. In 1959 they began rebuilding the HPA and the new Hungarian leader J√°nos K√°d√°r, asked for 200,000 Soviet troops from the Southern Group of Forces to stay in the country, which led to the government to rely more on the Soviets leading to the deterioration of the HPA. In 1968 it joined Soviet troops in invading Czechoslovakia and restoring order in Prague. Out of the mobilised 4 were killed in accidents. Soviet troops relaxed their control during the era of Mikhail Gorbachev, and Hungary later became a Democratic Republic. As it moved on from socialism the HPA was converted into the new model, officially dissolving the HPA and retaining its current form in the Hungarian Defence Force.  Composition  left The HPA's manpower by 1989 was approximately 100,000 and about 64,000 were conscripts. It had the smallest number of aircraft and least equipment in the Warsaw Pact. The HPA has two branches: * Ground Forces * Air and Air Defence Forces The branches not under the Ministry of Defense were the following: * People's National Police * People's Security Police * State Border Guard * Workers' Guard Corps The ground forces accounted for 77 percent of the HPA.  Organization  HPA troops on parade in April 4th. The combined strength of the HPA in 1989 was 100,000 personnel. The HPA was divided into the Ground and Air Forces. The Ground Forces were organized into:Order of battle of Hungarian People's Army, 1963. * 5th Hungarian Army at Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r ** 7th Motor Rifle Division at Kiskunf√©legyh√°za ** 8th Motor Rifle Division at Zalaegerszeg ** 9th Motor Rifle Division at Kaposv√°r ** 11th Tank Division at Tata ** 34th Special Reconnaissance Battalion at Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r * 3rd Army Corps at Cegl√©d ** 4th Motor Rifle Division at Gy√∂ngy√∂s ** 15th Motor Rifle Division at Ny√≠regyh√°za Air Forces Headquarters at Veszpr√©m * 11th Air-defense Artillery Brigade at Budapest, after 1977 √ârd * 1st Air Defense Division at Veszpr√©m ** 47th Fighter Regiment at P√°pa ** 31st Fighter Regiment at Tasz√°r ** 104th Air-defense Artillery Regiment Nagytarcsa after Szabadsz√°ll√°s * 2nd Air Defense Division at Miskolc ** 59th Fighter Regiment at Szolnok ** 105th Air-defense Artillery Regiment at Miskolc  Equipment  In the 1950s the Army was equipped with T-34/85 tanks, as well as 68 IS-2s, which were in service between 1950-1956. After the crackdown of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 all were returned to the Soviet Union.http://epa.oszk.hu/01600/01639/00008/pdf/EPA01639_elso_szazad_2012_tel_061-069.pdf The Army had 1,200 T-54 and T-55 tanks in 1988. It also had about 100 Soviet made T-72's in its inventory. The HPA's artillery included 225 M-1938 122 mm and 50 M-1943 or D-1 howitzers. It also included 90 2S1 122mm and 20 2S3 152mm self-propelled guns.  Military conscription  Tisztavat√°s on Kossuth Square, 1969. Most conscripts were poorly trained, and therefore they were used as a labor forces. All of the conscripts had to go through a few weeks of rifle training before they go into workers branches. During the conscription period opinion towards the HPA became very negative and it caused many young men to make excuses on why they should not be drafted (mainly fake medical excuses).

(Blood Simple in the UK) is a 2009 film directed by Zhang Yimou. It is a remake of Blood Simple, the 1984 debut of the Coen brothers, whose films Zhang Yimou lists as among his favorites. The film transports the original film's plot from a town in Texas to a noodle shop in a small desert town in Gansu province. The film is a mixture of a thriller and screwball comedy. The film stars Sun Honglei, Ni Dahong in the thriller segment while comedians Xiaoshenyang and Yan Ni star in the comedic segment. The film has been described as a considerable departure from the director's previous works. Premise Set in a Chinese noodle shop in the desert, the restaurant owner plans to murder his adulterous wife and her lover. Cast *Sun Honglei ‚Äì Zhang *Ni Dahong ‚Äì Wang *Xiaoshenyang ‚Äì Li *Yan Ni ‚Äì Wang's Wife Production Principal photography began in June 2009, and the film was released on December 11, 2009 in China. Reception The film made its international premiere in competition at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. The film received polarizing responses from audiences, with some noting the film's visual inventiveness and non-serious tone, while others criticized the film maker's use of slapstick humor and over-the-top style. Zhang revealed at the Berlinale that the Coen brothers had written to him after seeing a copy of the film, and expressed that they loved the changes made in this version. Derek Elley of Variety described the film as a \\"much more ascetic, chamber-like dramedy\\" that is a \\"pretty close adaptation\\" and \\"spiced up with some pratfall humor and visually enhanced by saturated lensing.\\" Elley also noted \\"Coen aficionados won't be surprised by any of the subsequent twists in the tale, and general auds will be pleasantly amused, as Zhang tries to manipulate events for his own purposes.\\" Maggie Lee of The Hollywood Reporter is more mixed on the film, and described it as \\"a high-rolling but garish production with untranslatable regional ribald humor\\", and noted the changes from the original with \\"pacing is much more frenetic with characters and cameras in restless motion. The intervals are crammed with exotic sight gags and colloquial wordplay, such as a dough-making scene choreographed like a plate-spinning acrobatic show or the group hip-hop dance routine.\\" Some critics also viewed the film as unique in Zhang's filmography. James Marsh of Twitch Film described the film as \\"a spectacular departure from his previous work\\", and praised the film's first half as \\"breakneck paced\\" and \\"many laughs to be had throughout\\", but noted \\"The second half takes a deliberate shift into darker territory, as those already familiar with the story will know, and while handled effectively in its own right, it does lose some of the energy generated in the first half.\\" However, Marsh states \\"that said, the film must certainly be deemed a success, both as an experimentation for the director, as an adaptation of Blood Simple and as a screwball comedy in its own right.\\" Edmund Lee of Time Out Hong Kong described the film as \\"surely one of the year's unlikeliest projects\\", and a \\"sacrilegiously funny period remake.\\" Lee further states: \\"Zhang has traded Texas' oppressively bleak vista for China's visually intoxicating desert landscape for this enthralling film, at once hilarious and cruelly ironic.\\" However, Perry Lam in Muse criticized it, stating: \\"The story unfolds in an almost surreal, suspiciously computer-generated setting that is decisively closed off to outer reality. Zhang, who usually cares deeply about his characters, loses his intense emotional command over his actors.\\" Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent reviewing the film at the Berlinale states \\"Zhang Yimou's remake of the Coen brothers' Blood Simple is exhilarating and inventive\\", and \\"Zhang's formal mastery is little short of astonishing...there are few film-makers who use colour or sound editing in such a bravura way.\\" The film cost approximately $12 million to make, notably less expensive than Zhang Yimou's most recent historical epics. The film, in spite of the polarized reception, was successful at the box-office, and went on to gross 261 million yuan ($38 million) in less than six weeks, tripling the film's budget.

Although predominantly a black and white film, the \\"Harlem Madness\\" number was filmed in Technicolor under the direction of Sammy Lee. The film is a \\"talkie\\", but MGM also issued it in a silent version, with Alfred Block writing the titles. The film was remade in 1949 as Take Me Out to the Ball Game.  Plot  Major league baseball player Jack Glennon (Schenck) watches out for alcoholic teammate Jerry Burke (Van). Both men are interested in Mary (Love), but Jack marries the gold-digging Daisy (Doran), who lures him away from baseball to the vaudeville stage. Later, Jerry and Mary become romantically involved, and Jack rejoins the baseball team after divorcing Daisy. Jerry notices that Jack is not playing well and is unhappy, and realizes that he must still be in love with Mary. He steps away from Mary, allowing her to be with Jack. Jack plays baseball well once again, and the team wins the World Series.  Cast   Reception  The film received lukewarm reviews.

He was managing director of the Savoy hotel group from 1941 to 1979 and its chairman from 1948 to 1984, continuing as president until his death. He was also chairman of the Savoy Theatre from 1948 until his death. In 1973‚Äì74, he was Lord Mayor of London. Wontner was appointed general secretary of the Hotels and Restaurants Association of Great Britain in 1933 at the age of 25. He shepherded the Savoy hotel group properties through the difficult World War II years, restoring their lustre after the war, and successfully preserved the group's independence against take-over bids in the 1950s, 1970s and 1980s. As chairman of the Savoy Theatre, he personally supervised its rebuilding after it was destroyed by fire in 1990. Wontner was closely involved in the City of London as a leading member of two of its ancient guilds and as alderman, chief magistrate and Lord Mayor. He was knighted in 1972. Biography Early years Wontner was the elder son of the actor-manager Arthur Wontner and his first wife, the actress Rose Pendennis, whose real name was Rosecleer Alice Amelia Blanche, n√©e Kingwell.Baker, Anne Pimlott. \\"Wontner, Sir Hugh Walter Kingwell (1908‚Äì1992)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 16 September 2009 He was born Hugh Walter Kingwell Wontner Smith, but his father changed the family name in 1909, dropping the \\"Smith\\". Wontner was educated at Oundle School and in France, but was not, he said later, an academic pupil.The Times, obituary, 27 November 1992 After working in the H√¥tel Meurice in Paris, Wontner joined the secretariat of the London Chamber of Commerce from 1927 to 1933. In 1933, at the age of 25, he was appointed general secretary of the Hotels and Restaurants Association of Great Britain. In 1936 Wontner married Catherine Irvin. They had two sons and one daughter. Savoy Group Wontner's work with the Hotels and Restaurants Association brought him into close contact with Sir George Reeves-Smith, managing director of the Savoy hotel group, who was the association's founder chairman. Reeves-Smith was impressed by Wontner's administrative abilities, and, as The Times noted, \\"the young man had other qualities also which appealed to the veteran managing director: a discerning palate for wines, a taste for travel, and a consuming passion for the theatre.... Wontner must have seemed ideal Savoy material.\\" In 1938 he invited Wontner to join the group as his assistant. When Reeves-Smith died at the age of 77 in May 1941, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, the Savoy chairman, had no doubts about the succession and appointed the 32-year-old Wontner as managing director of the Savoy group, which included the Berkeley and Claridges hotels as well as the Savoy. The Savoy Hotel Carte died in 1948, and as his heir, Bridget D'Oyly Carte, did not wish to become chairman,The Times obituary notice for Bridget D'Oyly Carte, 3 May 1985, p. 11 the Savoy board elected Wontner, the first person to combine the roles of chairman and managing director since the Savoy's founder, Richard D'Oyly Carte. Wontner remained managing director until 1979 and chairman until 1984. He was elected life president of the group in 1990. When Wontner took over, World War II was at its height, and he and his staff had to cope with bomb damage, food rationing, manpower shortage, and, at first, a serious decline in the number of foreign visitors. After the U.S. entered the war, business picked up as the Savoy Hotel became a favourite of American officers, diplomats, journalists and others. The hotel became a meeting place for war leaders: Lord Mountbatten, Charles de Gaulle, Jan Masaryk and General Wavell were among the regular Grill Room diners, and the hotel's air-raid shelters were \\"the smartest in London\\". Wontner co-operated fully with the government's wartime restrictions, helping to draw up an order imposing a five shilling limit on the price of a restaurant mealAbout ¬£10 in 2009 terms: see \\"Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present\\" and advising the government on managing the change from wartime rationing to peacetime conditions. After the war, Wontner set about restoring the standards of the Savoy group to their pre-war glory, investing a great deal of capital in repairing war damage, upgrading facilities and enhancing the prestige of the hotels in the group. Under his control Claridges became a home in London for numerous statesmen, from President Tito and King Hussein to Gandhi, while the Savoy attracted such show business stars as Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren and was visited by British royalty including George VI and Elizabeth II. Under Wontner's leadership, the group bought the Connaught Hotel in 1956, and in the early 1960s decided to relocate the Berkeley from Piccadilly to new premises in Knightsbridge for an opening in 1972. Wontner was cautious about expanding the Savoy group internationally, concerned that over-expansion might prejudice standards, but in 1970 he added the Lancaster Hotel in Paris to the group. Business methods Planter in the embankment gardens between the hotel and the river, commemorating Wontner's tenure Throughout his career, according to The Times, \\"Wontner was admired by business associates for his acumen, integrity and loyalty while being accused by his critics of aloofness and arrogance. Beneath a genial manner there certainly lay steely determination and a fair degree of ruthlessness.\\" Under his leadership, the Savoy group successfully fought off several hostile takeover bids using, on occasion, controversial stratagems to defeat the bidder.The Economist, 12 December 1953, p. 45 In 1953 the entrepreneur Charles Clore attempted to buy the Savoy group, and when his bid was rejected he sold his shares to the property developer Harold Samuel, who planned to redevelop the Piccadilly site of the Berkeley Hotel. Wontner temporarily transferred possession of the freehold of the Berkeley from the Savoy group to its staff pension fund until the bid was withdrawn. After this first attempted takeover, Wontner insured against future bids by issuing new shares in the group which carried 40 times as many votes each as the normal shares. These special shares were held by Bridget D'Oyly Carte, Wontner and their allies. The financial magazine The Economist found this ploy outrageous: \\"On grounds of principle, it is difficult to find condemnation too severe for what the Savoy Hotel board have done. They have taken, without the consent of their shareholders, a valuable property in which the shareholders have an equity and of which the best use is open to dispute. They have made it impossible for the shareholders ... to exert any control in future over the disposition of that property.\\" Nevertheless, Wontner's share structure enabled the board to defeat later takeover bids by Trafalgar House and Trusthouse Forte. During the latter, Charles Forte managed to acquire 69 per cent of the group's shares, but only 42 per cent of the voting rights, and was furious at being outwitted by Wontner, whom he accused of having \\"a great gift for supercilious indifference\\".quoted in DNB Having thwarted this final takeover bid, Wontner retired from his executive roles and accepted the position of president of the Savoy group. Other interests and honours Wontner had many other interests, prominent among which was the City of London, where he was at various times the Master of two Livery Companies, an alderman of the City Corporation, chief magistrate and, in 1973‚Äì74, Lord Mayor. He advised the royal household on its catering at Buckingham Palace and elsewhere, and in 1953 was appointed Clerk of the Royal Kitchens ‚Äì the first holder of the post since the early nineteenth century. He also inherited his father's love of the theatre and served as a member of the board of trustees of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and of the committee of the Barbican Centre.\\"Wontner, Sir Hugh (Walter Kingwell)\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 16 September 2009 He was proud of being a member of the Old Stagers, England's oldest amateur dramatic society, and of his association with the Savoy Theatre, of which he was chairman and managing director from 1948 until his death. When the theatre was destroyed by fire in 1990 Wontner personally supervised the reconstruction. The topping-out ceremony gave him great pleasure, and only a few days before his death he was looking forward to presiding over the re-opening in 1993. He was the recipient of many international honours, including Honorary Citizen of St Emilion, 1974; Freeman of the Seychelles, 1974; Order of Cisneros (Spain), 1964; Officer, L'√âtoile Equatoriale (Gabon), 1970; M√©daille de Vermeil, City of Paris, 1972; Ordre de l'√âtoile Civique (France), 1972; Officier du M√©rite Agricole (France), 1973; Commander, National Order of the Leopard (Zaire), 1974; Knight Commander, Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark), 1974; Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia, 1974; Knight Commander, Royal Swedish Order of the Polar Star, 1980; and a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John, 1973. His British honours were MVO 1950, CVO 1969, Knight Bachelor 1972, and GBE 1974. Wontner died of a heart attack in London, aged 84.

(Marie Th√©r√®se F√©licit√©; 16 May 1736 - 28 September 1744) was a French princess, daughter of Louis XV of France and Marie Leszczy≈Ñska. Biography Marie Th√©r√®se F√©licit√© de France was born at the Palace of Versailles as the seventh daughter and ninth child of Louis XV of France and his Polish-born consort Marie Leszczy≈Ñska. Known as Madame Sixi√®me from her birth, she was later baptised Marie-Th√©r√®se-F√©licit√© and was known as Madame Th√©r√®se. As the daughter of a king of France, she was a fille de France, (daughter of France). This rank allowed her the style of Royal Highness and she was the most important lady at court after her mother and her older sisters. However, daughters of the king were usually known as Madame followed by their baptismal name. In the case of Louis XV's daughters, when they were young, their baptismal name was replaced by an ordinal number as per their \\"arrival\\"; accordingly, Madame Th√©r√®se was Madame Sixi√®me, as the sixth daughter. When she was barely two years old, Madame Sixi√®me was taken to the Royal Abbey of Fontevraud in the Anjou province of France. She left with her sisters Princess Victoire of France (1733‚Äì1799), Princess Sophie of France (1734‚Äì1782) and Princess Louise of France (1737‚Äì1787). The princesses left Versailles on 6 June 1738 accompanied by furniture and a military escort. During her childhood, Madame Sixi√®me was often ill, and her governess noted that it was probably due to the warm climate of the region. In mid-September 1744, Madame Sixi√®me fell ill with smallpox. On 27 September, she was baptised. Her nurse and valet stood in as godparents. She died the following day. She was eight years old and had never seen her parents since her arrival at Fontevraud. Madame Th√©r√®se was buried at the Abbey of Fontevraud, which, in earlier times, had been the traditional burial place of members of the House of Plantagenet.

The station closed fully in 1945 when Wantage Tramway ceased operations. History Formed in 1873 to link Wantage Road station with its terminus at Wantage the line was cheaply built parallel to what was then the Besselsleigh Turnpike, and now the A338. The line was opened for goods on 1 October 1875, and to passengers on 11 October. The tramway junction was to the east of Wantage Road station; interchange passengers walked under the bridge to reach the tramway yard, where the westernmost siding (parallel to the road) was reserved for passenger tramcars. For most of its operation the line was well used and profitable but the advent of popular road transport saw a steady decline in passengers and freight.

With its distinct box-shaped oriental motif, TARIC makes a rather unusual and highly visible landmark in the city of Toronto, primarily due to its location on a vacant space near the very busy multi-level Hwy 401/Hwy 400 interchange. History and organization Building of TARIC was originally conceived after securing a grant from the World Islamic Call Society, following which purchase of of land was completed in 1977. However, it was to take well over a decade to accumulate the necessary additional funds for the construction of a building. The current building structure was completed and opened to public in 1991, and is in fact only the first of a two-phase complex of a much larger building. The TARIC building houses a library, a gymnasium and the main prayer hall. With a full-time imam, weekend classes on Arabic and the basics of the Islamic religion are taught, as well as dawah programs and dialogue with local community and neighbourhood organizations. TARIC's goal is to bring the simple, honest message of Islam to Muslims and non-Muslims alike. This means stressing the importance of the five pillars of Islam encouraging Muslims to read the Qur'an, and to constantly practice zikkir (the remembrance of Allah). Activities The issue of Gulf Weekly of 25‚Äì31 May 1995 said \\"..The TARIC Islamic Centre, probably the most vibrant and effective in reaching out to non-Muslims is, perhaps the premier Muslim outfit in Metropolitan Toronto.\\" A large number of programmes are carried out at the Centre. Some of these include, Adult Tarbiya class on Sundays, Arabic language classes, A marriage introduction service, Marriage and family counseling, Conducting marriages and funerals, An Islamic bookstore, Interfaith dialogue, Dawa programmes for non Muslims, Mosque visits, Political and social awareness programmes, Seminars on Islamic and secular subjects, Family nights, Summer camps, Weekly youth activities, and other Women‚Äôs programmes as well. At one time, TARIC had also established a full-time Islamic school from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8 in a building leased from the Toronto District School Board.

He was the only player to have captained a Burnley team in a winning FA Cup Final. Career Boyle was born in the village of Hoyland in Yorkshire in 1886. He started his career at Barnsley. In 1912 Boyle crossed the Pennines to sign for Burnley for what was then a club record fee of ¬£1,150. He was described as a great header of the ball, an excellent passer with great leadership qualities, and as being one of the best players ever to play for Burnley. Having lifted the FA Cup in 1914, he then became the first Burnley captain to lift the League Championship Trophy as Burnley won the 1920‚Äì21 title. By then, he was 33 and his career was coming to an end. That season was to be his last full season in the first team. He made his last appearance for Burnley during the 1921‚Äì22 season, and after a further year playing in the reserves he signed for Wrexham, where he ended his playing career. After his playing career, he had a spell coaching in Germany. He won only one England cap against Ireland in Belfast in 1913. He also played in four representative matches for the Football League.
