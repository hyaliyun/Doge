Johannsen earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1978, traveled throughout Europe and returned to Madison to earn a master's degree in English nearly a decade later. After living in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia for twenty years, she made her home on VanWinkle Grove, in Berea, Kentucky with her husband Kevin Barbour Millham. She published three books, as well as numerous travel articles, magazine articles and internationally used textbooks. Writings With Al Fritsch, Johannsen was co-author of Ecotourism in Appalachia: Marketing the Mountains, which won the 2004 Caudill Prize. The Caudill award is made by Bookworm and Silverfish in Rural Retreat, Virginia to recognize outstanding investigative writing about Appalachian issues similar to Harry Caudill's Night Comes to the Cumberlands. Johannsen was co-editor (with Bobbie Ann Mason and Mary Ann Taylor-Hall) of Missing Mountains: We went to the mountaintop, but it wasn't there.

With the ‚Äúone person, one language‚Äù approach, each parent consistently speaks only one of the two languages to the child. For instance, the child's mother might speak to him or her exclusively in French, while the father might use only English. Reasoning Traditionally, the ‚Äúone person, one language‚Äù method has been regarded as the best method for bilingual language acquisition free of mixed utterances. The term ‚Äúone person, one language‚Äù was first introduced by the French linguist Maurice Grammont in 1902. He theorized that by separating the languages from the beginning, parents could prevent confusion and code-mixing in their bilingual children.Barron-Hauwaert 2004, p. 2. George Saunders wrote in his book Bilingual Children: From Birth to Teens that the ‚Äúone person, one language‚Äù approach ‚Äúensures that the children have regular exposure to and have to make use of each language. This is particularly important for the minority language, which has little outside support.\\"Saunders 1988, p. 49. This method has also been linked to an early development of metalinguistic awareness.De Houwer 1996, sec. 4.2. Implementation In a study published in the Infant Mental Health Journal, Naomi Goodz found that fathers tend to adhere more strictly to the ‚Äúone person, one language model\\" than mothers.Goodz 1989, 39. Even when parents reported strictly following a ‚Äúone person, one language‚Äù scheme, naturalistic observations found repeated instances of language mixing in both parents.De Houwer 1996, sec. 4.4. Masae Takeuchi conducted research on 25 Japanese mothers in Melbourne, Australia who were using the one person, one language approach to support their children's Japanese/English bilingual development. Takeuchi found that consistency is the key to the success of the approach. Most of the children in Takeuchi's study did not end up using Japanese actively after leaving school and only those children who were raised by mothers who consistently insisted on speaking only Japanese went on to use Japanese actively as adults.  Alternatives  Alternatives to \\"one person, one language\\" (OPOL) are \\"minority language at home\\" (ML@H), \\"time and place\\" (T&L; = specific language for specific time and/or place), \\"mixed language policy\\" (MLP = mixing languages depending on situation, topic, etc.), and individual family-based models.Arancha Ruiz Mart√≠n (January 2017): Mixed system 1: A language strategy for bilingual families.

It opened in 1953 and is located on Pine Forest Road. It is christened after the nickname of Pensacola‚Äî\\"City of Five Flags.\\" It runs several local classes during the regular racing season (March ‚Äì October). These classes include Super Late Models, Pro Late Models, Pro Trucks, Outlaw Stocks, Sportsman, and Pure Stocks. The races are usual held on Friday nights bi-weekly. The track has also hosted many regional touring series. Five Flags hosted a Grand National (now NASCAR Cup Series) race the year that the track opened (1953). The race was won by Herb Thomas driving his Fabulous Hudson Hornet. Other major tours that it has hosted included the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series East in 2013 and 2014, NASCAR Southeast Series from 1991 through 1997, the ARCA Racing Series from 1992 to 1996, an ASA National Tour date in 2002, and the CARS X-1R Pro Cup Series from 2001 to 2003. In 2019, the ARCA Menards Series returned to the track, but for one year only. After the merge between ARCA and NASCAR after the 2019 season, the former NASCAR K&N; Pro Series East, (now called ARCA Menards Series East) will run a race at Five Flags Speedway in 2020. The track's signature event is the Snowball Derby, run every December since 1968. ESPN said that the \\"Snowball Derby is one of the premier late- model stock-car races in the country, attracting some of the top drivers.\\" Due to the track lay-out and the highly banked turns, Five Flags is an extremely fast track. The current track record for Super Late Models is 16.120 seconds, set by Ty Majeski in qualifying for the 2015 Snowball Derby. Five Flags is also well known for having an abrasive surface that quickly wears tires. This characteristic rewards drivers who do not abuse their tires and is considered by many to be part of the appeal of the track.

It is produced using sugar, flavoring agents and thickeners as primary ingredients. Instant pudding can be used in some baked goods. Manufacturing Many flavors of instant pudding are produced. Sugar, a flavoring agent, and thickeners are primary ingredients. Instant chocolate pudding mix is manufactured using cocoa. A key ingredient in instant pudding is gelatinized starch, a dried instant starch that readily absorbs liquids, which causes the pudding to gel when mixed with milk. Additional ingredients sometimes used as a thickener include gums that are soluble in cold water, such as carrageenans and alginates. Phosphate salts are sometimes used, which contribute to the gelling of the finished product. Some Jell-O brand instant puddings are vegan, such as those in vanilla, lemon, banana cr√®me, and pistachio flavors. Many flavors of instant pudding are produced, with manufacturers including Kraft Foods and Jel Sert whose products are marketed under the Jell-O and Royal brand names. Nutrition information One serving (one-quarter of a box) of dry Jell-O chocolate- flavored instant pudding contains 110 calories, 430 mg sodium, 8 g carbohydrate, 18 g sugars, and 1 g of dietary fiber. It also contains 4% of the daily Recommended Dietary Allowance of iron. Instant pudding mixes are produced in non-fat and sugar-free varieties. Preparation Instant pudding is typically prepared by combining the powdered mix with milk and mixing the ingredients. Puddings may be cooled in a refrigerator before serving. Uses In addition to being eaten as-is and used as a pie filling, instant pudding can be used in baked goods such as cakes and cookies. Instant pudding added to cake mix can result in a denser and moister cake compared to cakes prepared without it. The use of instant pudding can cause a cake to fall or shrink as it cools, more than a cake prepared without the pudding. Use of a small amount of instant pudding lessens shrinkage compared to using a whole box. Cookies prepared using instant pudding may be moister compared to those without it.

It is known only from three isolated populations in Fiordland. Distribution and habitat The distribution of S. homerensis is not known to overlap with that of any other grasshopper species and it is known only from the Earl Mountains.Morris, S.J. 2003: Two new species of Sigaus from Fiordland, New Zealand (Orthoptera: Acrididae). New Zealand entomologist, 26: 65‚Äì74. PDF S. homerensis is one of three known alpine grasshoppers found in Fiordland, the other species being Alpinacris tumidicauda and Sigaus takahe. Known sites of S. homerensis are regularly swept clear of tall plants by avalanches, making these areas more sparsely vegetated than the surrounding. Similar terrain and vegetation is found outside the known distribution, however, S. homerensis are not found in these areas. A possible explanation of this could be associated with avalanches, vegetation height and sunshine hours. This region receives high rainfall (about 8000 mm/year) coupled with the lowest sunshine hours in New Zealand (1400 to 1600 h/year). It appears that these small cleared areas are better for S. homerensis than avalanche- free areas with their taller vegetation. New Zealand Acrididae are diurnal sun-baskers and require basking surface to become active for the day. S. homerensis prefer altitudes between , however, it can be found as low as and as high as .

An earlier version, \\"Rosin the Bow\\" (not \\"Beau\\") refers to rosin with the bow of a violin, but both cover the same general subject (see below: Full lyrics). There are many variations of the song(s), and the tune has been re-used in other songs for political campaign jingles, slave songs, comedy songs, or other folk songs. Early versions of \\"Old Rosin the Beau\\" relate the story of a man who was popular in his youth, then in late life, the ladies refer to him as \\"Old Rosin, the beau\\", as he prepares for the grave. As a drinking song, the chorus chimes, \\"Take a drink for Old Rosin the Beau\\" and uses dark comedy, with jests about his grave or tombstone, taken in stride while repeating the sing-song melody. The song is structured where soloists can sing a verse, and then the group can join the chorus/refrain portion after each verse. Partial lyrics The lyrics depend on which version of the song is considered. The 1838 version of \\"Old Rosin the Beau\\" begins with the following verse: \\"anonymous - Public Domain Music\\", pdmusic.org, 2010, web: PDM-38or. The lyrics, as arranged by J. C. Beckell in 1838, are as follows: The original folk song, \\"Rosin the Bow\\" begins as follows: Early history Both the tune and early lyrics for \\"Rosin the Bow\\" are traditional (with no known author). In 1838, the variation \\"Old Rosin the Beau\\" was published as a \\"Comic Song Dedicated to the Members of the Falcon Club by the Publisher\\" (Ld. Meignen & Co.), arranged by J. C. Beckell. Other texts Several US presidential campaign songs were set to the tune of \\"Old Rosin the Beau\\", including for William Henry Harrison (\\"The Hero of Tippecanoe\\"), Henry Clay (\\"Harry, the Honest and True\\") and Abraham Lincoln (\\"Lincoln and Liberty\\"). A 19th-century American hymn by Seymour Boughton Sawyer, \\"How bright is the day when the Christian\\", was set to the tune and published as \\"Sawyer's Exit\\" in the Sacred Harp edition of 1850, in a three- part arrangement attributed to John Massengale.Shaping the Values of Youth: Sunday School Books in 19th Century America (UMiss website) The tune has been used in \\"Acres of Clams\\" (aka \\"Old Settler's Song\\"). It is also the melody to \\"Down in the Willow Garden\\" (aka \\"Rose Connolly\\"). Randy Sparks later used it for the song \\"Denver\\", performed by The New Christy Minstrels on their 1963 live album, The New Christy Minstrels ‚Äì In Person. The melody was also used in several Irish rebel songs including \\"The Boys of Kilmichael\\", \\"The Men of the West\\" and \\"The Soldiers of Cumann na mBan\\". On his album The Irish-American's Song, David Kincaid used the tune as the setting for a Confederate version of \\"Kelly's Irish Brigade\\", a song from the American Civil War, earlier set to \\"Columbia, Gem of the Ocean\\".

The affair took place on December 6, 2010, at Kronstadt boulevard in the north of Moscow. Sviridov's death provoked a number of high-profile rallies and rioting in the capital as well as in Saint Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don and other cities across Russia.

More than 10 people were involved in the conflict between fans of FC Spartak Moscow and natives of the North Caucasus. The suspected killer and his friends were released and rumoured to have done so through bribing the police. It has now come to light that Aslan Cherkesov, who fired the bullets that killed Sviridov, was convicted in 2009 of grievous bodily harm and drug possession, which carry severe penalties in Russia. Despite this, he appears to have avoided jail, which has given further weight to the allegations of bribery and criminality. Further anger was caused by the fact that the killing mirrored that of journalist Yuri Volkov. Also a Spartak Moscow fan, Volkov and his friends were attacked by a gang of Chechen men in July 2010. The suspected killer was released by the police with no charge. Official statements said lack of evidence was the reason, but there were open claims that the police had been bribed by members of Chechen diaspora.The Manege of Xenophobia Opinion The Moscow Times Russian Protests Erupt Over Soccer Fan's Killing - NYTimes.com Despite Cherkesov and his gang claiming to be acting in self-defence, witnesses state that it was they who actually initiated the brawl, as well as outnumbering the Russian Spartak fans 8 to 5. Sviridov and his friends were by a bus stand, waiting for a taxi to arrive. The Russian men were laughing and joking amongst themselves when the Caucasian group, passing by, confronted them and accused them of laughing at them.

E. Smythe (1861‚Äì1922), was a journalist, writer and founder of the Little Landers movement, which aimed to settle small suburban lots with people who would farm their own properties, live off the land and sell or trade the surplus for needed income. In 1908 he set up such a colony in the Tijuana River valley (now San Ysidro, California), and in 1913 he joined in developing a similar venture in Tujunga, California.Joe Stone, in a 1959 San Diego Tribune article cited in \\"William Ellsworth Smythe (1861‚Äì1922)\\", San Diego History Center website Smythe described the basic structure of the Little Land philosophy as colonies that \\"would provide low priced land, a public irrigation system and a cooperative market for the colony's products.\\" Smythe in 1893 (Los Angeles Times drawing) Personal life Smythe was born December 24, 1861, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to William Augustus Smythe, a wealthy shoe manufacturer, and Abbie Bailey Smythe. In 1882 he and Harriet Bridge were married. They had three children. Smythe died at the age of 61 on October 6, 1922, in his apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York City. He was survived by his son, W.E. Smythe Jr.\\"W.E. Smythe Dies Here,\\" New York Times, October 8, 1922 Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website. Journalism In high school he was editor of the school newspaper and later, in 1881, at the age of twenty, he tried to establish a printing business, but failed. Between 1888 and 1890 he published the Kearney Enterprise in Kearney, Nebraska. In 1889 a feisty Nebraska newspaper publisher named Edward Rosewater made Smythe the editor of the Omaha Bee. \\"The next year a terrible draught gripped the Great plains. Smythe saw farmers abandoning their land and, within sight of creeks that had carried water a year before, shoot their livestock because they couldn't prevent the beasts from dying of thirst.\\" Smythe obtained the publisher's approval for a series of articles about the importance of irrigation. He researched the subject carefully, going back to the times of ancient Egypt, and published articles daily. He wrote for national magazines. He spoke at public meetings and became chairman of the influential National Irrigation Congress. Eventually he traveled the breadth of the country to drive home his message. He founded a magazine, Irrigation Age, which he edited until 1896. Settlements Smythe organized a cooperative settlement called New Plymouth in Idaho and advised developers near Sacramento, California, and in Lassen County, where he founded the town of Standish. He moved to San Diego in 1902 and promptly ran unsuccessfully for Congress in the newly created Eighth District, as a Democrat, garnering 40.8 percent of the vote. Imperial Valley In 1904 he traveled to Washington, D.C., to lobby for Imperial Valley farmers who wanted public ownership of the irrigation system in their valley. This trip earned him the scorn of Harrison Gray Otis's Los Angeles Times, which wrote > Investigation shows that the Imperial Water Users' Association has paid > Smythe $2000 cash. Whether he presented an itemized bill showing all this to > have been used as \\"expense money\\" was not learned.

Access to this link requires the use of a library > card. Little Landers In 1908 he formed a corporation that bought 700 acres of the Belcher Ranch on the U.S. side of the Tijuana River, which is shared with Mexico, and immediately changed the name of the entire community to San Ysidro, after the patron saint of farmers in Spain.This was the first Little Landers colony, which attracted some 300 families to its promise.\\"Hotel: Residents Spend the Future in a Room With a View of the Past,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 12, 1987, page SD-D-4 Access to this link requires the use of a library card. Smythe lived there from 1909 to 1911, overseeing a market that the farmers set up in San Diego to sell their produce. Smythe began writing editorials in 1912 for the Scripps newspapers, whose publisher, E.W. Scripps, lived in San Diego, and he published a Little Landers magazine. He opened a Little Landers colony called Runnymede. In 1913, M.V. Hartranft, a Glendale, California, land developer with utopianist ideas, joined with Smythe in forming a Little Landers colony in Tujunga, just north of the Verdugo Mountains in Los Angeles County.Marlene A.

Bibliography Smythe's most famous work was The Conquest of Arid America (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1900). Writing two books occupied his time between 1902 and 1907. They were Constructive Democracy and History of San Diego. He published a third book as well, in 1921, City Homes on Country Lanes, and another, Reclamation of Arid America.

He was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1881. His undergraduate education was in the South, at Wofford College from 1897 to '99, and at Richmond College (now the University of Richmond), where he received his B.A. in 1904. He spent two years of graduate work at Johns Hopkins, and received his M.A. at University of Chicago in 1910.Jacob F. Rivers, Cultural values in the Southern sporting narrative, pp. 139-142 He worked as an assistant professor of English at Richmond (1910-'11), Missouri State Normal School ('11-'13), and Wake Forest ('15-'17). Derieux had already published a few stories, and in 1917 he joined the editorial staff in the New York offices of The American Magazine,\\"Samuel A. Derieux\\", New York Times, February 28, 1922, where he then published one in each of the next two years, and two to six a year thereafter. He was among the winners of an O. Henry memorial award in the awards' first year, and was the first author to accumulate three of the awards ('19, '21, and‚Äîposthumously  '22). He died in Manhattan of appendicitis at the age of 41 on February 25, 1922.  A Boy and His Dog  In 1946, Derieux received posthumous story credit for the short film A Boy and His Dog. (The film's 6 characters correspond closely to the most important of those of his O. Henry-winning 1918 story \\"The Trial in Tom Belcher's Store\\", including the subtle point that the crucial character Squire Kirby is (once) addressed as \\"Jim Kirby\\", and (once) referred to as \\"Squire Jim Kirby\\", in the story, which corresponds to the film cast's character being specified as \\"Squire Jim Kirby\\". The story parallels in essentials the (widely circulated) plot summary for A Boy and His Dog that is attributed to David Glagovsky by the Internet Movie Database.Plot Summary for A Boy and His Dog (1946) While they agree in starting the action on Friday, the film's summary is more detailed in specifying Monday as the day of the trial; the story simply says \\"Then one afternoon...\\" (not \\"the next day\\"), following a Saturday of hunting by an unknown interval, and places the trial on the day following the consequently unspecified afternoon.

In 1974, Marine Corps were disbanded from the services of Pakistan Armed Forces by President, later elected Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as the Service branch had completely failed to achieve any minor or major objectives in the both 1971 Winter War and the Bangladesh Liberation War. On April 14, 1990, the Marine Corps were recreated in the Pakistan's Pakistan Defence Forces, and is recognized as one of her seven uniformed services as of 2000. In 1990, Pakistan Navy decided to establish the first Marine Battalion at Qasim Fort which was at that time under the operational control of PNS Himalaya. On November 25, 1990, the PNS Qasim was given commissioned as the headquarters/logistic base of Pakistan Marines. The Commissioning Crew consisted of eight senior flag rank officers, 67 Chief Petty Officers and Sailors from general Service and 43 Marines office r. The base oversaw and witnessed the Indo-Pakistani War of 1999, Atlantique Incident, 2002 Indo- Pakistani Standoff, War on Terror and Sir Creek Conflict. Organisation Marines Training Centre (MTC) The Marines Training Centre (MTC) was established in 1990 to impart basic and advanced training for the Pakistan Marines (PM). During the 1990s, the Pakistan Army provided and trained the 1st Marine Offence Battalion as well as running the Training Centre. In 2000, the Pakistan Navy took control of the centre while the Army continued to train the Marines. In 2004, as Marines were given the status of one of the seven recognised uniformed services of the Pakistan Armed Forces, the PM took control of the Centre. As of today, there are large numbers of United States Marine Corps and Royal Marines personnel, as military advisors, providing training for the Marines. Pakistan Naval Police The MTC is also the headquarters of the Pakistan Navy Police (PNP), and conducts basic and refresher training for PNP personnel. Creeks Battalion The Creeks battalion was raised in April 1999 by the Pakistan Army with the objective to thwart external threat in creeks, through a forward presence and active surveillance in peacetime, as well as defending designated areas of responsibility during wartime.

Life Maud (Magdalena) Mannoni (maiden name: Van der Spoel) was born in the Belgian city of Kortrijk, but spent her early childhood in Ceylon. After studying criminology at Brussels University, she began a training analysis with one of the pioneering Belgian psychoanalysts, Maurice Dugautiez. Thereafter she moved to France in 1949, where she married Octave Mannoni. While in Paris, she made contact with Fran√ßoise Dolto, and had further analysis with Jacques Lacan, supporting him during the 1953 split, and again after that of 1963, along with her husband Octave, Serge Leclaire, and Jean Clavreul.√âlisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (Cambridge 1997) p. 293 On the backward child Lacan, in the first of his seminars to be published, singled out ‚Äúour colleague Maud Mannoni, [with] a book that has just come out and which I would recommend you to read...The Retarded Child and the Mother‚Äù.Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (Penguin 1994) p. 238 In that book she concludes that the subnormal patient has not been able to separate his or her ego from the mother.Neville Symington, Becoming a Person through psychoanalysis (London 2007) p. 139 Instead, a kind of symbiosis takes place: the roots of such psychoses, in the words of the Lacanian Bernard Touati, ‚Äúare inscribed in the maternal unconscious, with the psychotic child being unrecognised as a desiring subject...and frozen as partial object subjected to maternal omnipotence‚Äù. From 1964, and the launch of the Lacanian movement onwards, Mannoni began to have a revolutionary influence on an entire generation in France‚Äîparents, teachers, child therapists, and analysts alikeQuestia: About the Author‚Äîthrough her work. She died in Paris. The child's speech Mannoni drew a distinction between what she called parole pleine and parole vide‚Äîfull and empty speech‚Äîin relation to the language of the child.Michael O'Loughlin, The Subject of Childhood (2009) p. 34 Empty speech refers to the language of a child saturated by the symbols of parental knowledge, as opposed to 'full speech'‚Äîspoken from the heart. Linking her analysis to Alice Miller's view of the over-dutiful child, Mannoni argued that ‚Äúthe subject of the words is not necessarily the child‚Äù,O'Loughlin, p. 84 being particularly concerned with how an emotionally engulfing parent prevents the child from owning and inhabiting his or her own experience. Every child, she points out, is born into a pre- existing parental discourse; and in certain circumstances the alienating burden of parental expectation can block a child's sense of entitlement to its own speech‚Äîits own life.Guy Hall et al., Theory and Practice of Child Psychoanalysis (2009) p. 41 Support centres and anti-psychiatry Mannoni specialised in mental illness in children, and in 1969 established the school of Bonneuil-sur-Marne, a community live-in project for children with autism and psychosis. In doing so, she has been described as ‚Äúprofoundly influenced by the antipsychiatry of R. D. Laing and D. Cooper‚Äù,Jacquy Chemouni, Histoire de la Psychanalyse en France (1991) an influence which can also be seen perhaps in her view of the child as the dysfunctional family's spokesperson. Until it was reformed as a day hospital in 1975, Bonneuil would be a leading institutional influence, known for its wide variety of therapeutic methods and its disregard for traditional boundaries.E.

He was shot to death by the police on 20 March 1923.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Crimes-that-rocked- Madras/articleshow/3465354.cms History Born in the state of Travancore, he grew up working as a farm-hand, until in his early to mid-twenties he took to the road and became a highwayman along the Travancore-Madras Presidency border, operating mainly in the districts of Kanyakumari and Tinnevelly. He formed a band of desperadoes which, at its height, comprised some twenty to thirty men, notably amongst them, Kasi Nadan, Kalluli Mangan and Doravappa, Jambulingam's right-hand man. They started by waylaying travellers on the highways between Madras and Travancore, an act in which they were in no small measure helped by the poor policing of the densely forested frontier. Also abetting them was the division of jurisdiction between the British forces in the Presidency and the Royal Police in Travancore. Jambulingam Nadar's modus operandi was to have his gang lay in wait in thickets or copses, signalling each other with owl-hoots or whistles, awaiting unwitting passers-by on foot or on bullock-cart. Upon locating a suitable target they would track them down until a safe opportunity presented itself to ambush them, without risk to themselves. After relieving their victims of their valuables, they would turn their bullocks loose, to give themselves time to get away. Emboldened by the success of their ventures in the forests, they started striking in the smaller towns and villages in the area, especially in the early hours of the morning, expanding their haunts to include parts of modern-day Tuticorin district, making a regular menace of themselves, and constituting an excellent bogeyman for the children of the area. Their fast-growing notoriety brought upon them the unwelcome attention of the law, by the mid-1920s, with the Madras and Travancore police commencing joint patrols of the forests of Aramboly, where Jambulingam was reputed to have his hide-out. Rewards offered for information leading to Jambulingam's capture were to no avail for long, for he maintained the favour of the villagers and peasants by parcelling out his loot with them. However, c. 1926-'27, information was provided to the Madras Police by one of Jambulingam's gang-members, which led to his being surprised near Aramboly and shot in the act of making his escape. While Doravappa attempted to continue their nefarious work, he was captured by the police in a short while. The gang disbanded soon thereafter. Legacy A biography was written of Jambulinga Nadan, after his death, by one of the police-officers entrusted with his capture. At the height of their terror, a popular Tamil ditty made the rounds of the area. It ran thus: Jambulinga Nadan pora vazhi, jannalgal ellam thavudu podi, Kasi Nadan pora vazhi, kadhavugal ellam thavudu podi, Kalluli Mangan Pora vazhi, kallugal ellam thavudu podi, Doravappa pora vazhi - enn aatha! naan poga matein. To translate into English: Jambulinga Nadan's way is marked with broken windows, Kasi Nadan's way is marked with stoved-in doors, Kalluli Mangan's way is marked by stones powdered, Doravappa's way - I wouldn't venture that for the love of my mother! In popular culture Jayan portrays Jambulingan in the 1979 Malayalam film Vellayani Paramu. The 1982 Malayalam film Jambulingam stars Prem Nazir in the lead role.

Applying pressure. B. Tool heats target and melts through it. C. Screw thread tapping. Friction drilling is a method of making holes in metal in which the material is pushed out of the way with the aid of heat from friction. The process is also called thermal drilling, flow drilling, form drilling, or friction stir drilling. Friction drilling is commonly used on bicycle frames, heat exchangers, and to create holes for mounting bearings. History In 1923, the Frenchman Jean Claude de Vali√®re tried making a tool that could make holes in metal by friction heat, instead of by machining. It was only a moderate success, because at that time the right materials were not yet available. Moreover, he hadn't yet discovered the right shape for this kind of tool. It was not until the 1980s that a useful tool could be produced. Principle Friction drilling uses a conical bit made of very heat-resistant material such as cemented carbide. This device is pressed against a target material with both high rotational speed and high pressure. That way, there is a high local production of heat which softens the object, making it plastic. The tool then \\"sinks\\" through the object, making a hole in it. Lubricants help prevent work- material from adhering to the bit. Unlike drilling, material that is flowed is not lost but it forms a sleeve around the hole. The length of that sleeve is up to 3 times the original thickness of the material. The presence of this metal lip around hole edges makes connections stronger. Several options are available with this technology. Bits may include a cutting device that removes the typical \\"collar\\" of plastified material that flows upwards, so that an even top surface is the result. Drilled starter holes may be used to reduce the required axial force and to leave a smooth finish in the bushing‚Äôs lower edge. Internal screw threads may be cut with taps or rolled with dies. Advantages * Very quick process (2 to 6 seconds) * The process reshapes all material so that no material is lost. The excess material forms a sleeve that is about 3 times longer than the original thickness of the target material, which makes it possible to make very strong bolt joints in thin material. * It is a clean process because no litter (particles) is produced. * No access needed to back of workpiece, as with rivet nuts. * Works in almost all kinds of metal. Disadvantages * Friction drilling is not possible in massive material since displaced metal must be able to flow somewhere. Maximum material thickness is typically half of the hole diameter with bit manufacturers providing specific guidance. * The target material must be able to withstand the added heat. Materials that have been painted, plastic coated, galvanized, or heat treated are often unsuitable for this process. * Requires higher motor capacity and rotational speed than conventional drills.

Many students who perform in the Athletic Band also perform in The Ohio State University Marching Band. Each Athletic Band features full contemporary concert band instrumentation, including woodwinds. It performs throughout the year at various athletic and goodwill functions across campus. Members of the Athletic Band receive course credit for their band participation.http://osumarchingband.com/athletic History Military band Military training was an important part of the early curriculum at Ohio State, and a band was formed to provide music for the cadets to drill to. The first appearance of a marching band was in 1878, as a 12 piece fife and drum corps. The first marching band in 1878 was sponsored by the Military Department at OSU, and continued to perform for military functions until 1881, when a missing mouthpiece incident led to the student director's expulsion from the university, and the Military Department refusing to sponsor a program. Various student-led bands with no university faculty were formed and performed through 1896. In 1896, the Military Department decided to once again sponsor a band, hiring Gustav Bruder as their director. Under Bruder, and later Eugene J. Weigel, the band grew in size to a block of 64, and later 100 bandsmen. They also began playing and marching for most military and athletic events. By 1929, the Marching Band, which Weigel limited to an even 100 musicians, was composed mostly of upperclass ROTC cadets. This caused many of the freshman and sophomore students to be unable to march. Weigel, in his desire to create a more well-rounded music program at the university, created two Regimental Bands to complement the Marching Band. These bands, known as the Infantry Regimental Band and the Artillery Regimental Band, helped to train new students in the marching style of the Marching Band. These bands met primarily in the Winter and Spring Quarters, and were often complemented by the upperclass members of the Marching Band, looking to continue to improve their marching and musicianship. In 1934, Weigel removed all woodwind instruments from the marching band (flutes, clarinets, saxophones, etc.) The only exception to this was during World War II. From 1943‚Äì1945, director William McBride allowed woodwinds, vocalists, young, old, and even citizens of the campus community to wear the uniform and perform at home football games. The Regimental Bands continued to complement the Marching Band throughout the 1940s and 1950s. In 1952, the ROTC department, by directive of the Department of Defense, had to sever ties with the Marching Band program. This allowed the general membership of The Ohio State University to try out and become members of the Marching Band. The Regimental Bands, which were combined into one Military Band, continued to perform during the Winter and Spring, and were conducted by the Band Staff of the Marching Band. Under director Charles Spohn, the Military Band became an ensemble that was highly respected. In 1970, the Military Band recorded the album Adjutant's Call. The Military Band was eventually merged with the Buckeye Scarlet and Gray bands. Athletic band In 1947, Jack O. Evans created the first Activities Band on campus. The Activities Band, from inception, allowed both men and women. This band performed at concerts, Men's basketball games and some pep rally events across campus. In 1956, the band's name was changed to the Buckeye Band. Enrollment in the Buckeye Band was open to students who played any concert band instrument, unlike the Marching Band which was limited to brass and percussion only. In the late 1950s, with membership passing 130 members, the Buckeye Band was split into two bands: Buckeye Scarlet and Buckeye Gray. These bands were run separately from the Marching and Military Bands until 1979. In 1980, the Military band took over the performance of Basketball games from the Buckeye Bands. The Buckeye Bands became concert bands solely, taking on the names \\"University Band\\" and \\"Symphonic Band.\\"http://music.osu.edu/bands/history The new Military Band performed at Men's and Women's Basketball games, the Spring Football Game, ROTC parades, other campus events, and concerts throughout the city. The Military Band continued to also be a source of training for prospective members of the Marching Band, as well as an ensemble for veteran Marching Band members to stay in shape with. By 1980, the Military Band's uniforms were replaced for Men's Basketball games. The band started wearing gray slacks and white shirts with a red vest for these games. The military style uniforms continued to be used for concerts, parades, and the Spring Football Game. The Military Band met twice a week, and once the Spring Football Game was over, the remainder of the year was typically spent teaching more advanced marching fundamentals used by the Marching Band. As the Military Band began performing at Men's and Women's Basketball, various different uniforms were experimented with for these athletic events, including scarlet and gray striped Waldo sweaters, jerseys, and T-shirts. The Men's Basketball Band was an auditioned band, while the bands that performed at other events were open enrollment. In 1988, the Marching Band received funds for new uniforms. Dr. Jon Woods kept the old Marching Band uniforms for use by the Military Band. These uniforms were used by the Military Band until the 1992 Spring Football Game. After that game, it was decided to retire the military uniforms and standardize the Spring Military Band with red polo shirts and gray pants. In 1994, Dr. Jon Woods decided to retire the name \\"Military Band,\\" since the band typically performed at only one ROTC event, and did not wear any type of military uniform. The program was restarted in the autumn of 1994 as the Athletic Band. The Athletic Band continued to perform at the same functions as the Military Band did during Winter and Spring Quarters. In the Autumn Quarter of 1996, Dr. Jon Woods was approached by the OSU Athletic Department to form a Fall Quarter Athletic Band. This band would perform at women's volleyball games during the Autumn and then perform at pre-season Men's Basketball and hockey games. The first Volleyball Band at OSU premiered with 14 students, one of whom was the conductor. The band continued to experiment with various uniforms, including track suits, T-shirts, and polos. As enrollment increased, the Athletic Band would be split into evenly orchestrated smaller bands, which rehearsed together and occasionally performed as a full ensemble. In the early 21st century, with declining enrollment, the Winter Athletic Band ended auditions for the Men's Basketball Band, and rather split up the total enrollment of the band into smaller bands of relatively equal instrumentation. In 2006, the Band Staff launched a program called the \\"Total Band Program.\\" This program emphasized the importance of the Athletic Band alongside the Marching Band. The Marching Band would host an event every Spring known as Junior & Senior Night, which invited high school students to tour the Marching Band facilities and perform with the Marching Band in a concert at the end of the day. High school students would be given a tour in small groups by Squad Leaders and other members of the Marching Band. This event was opened to Athletic Band in 2006, and Junior & Senior Night was opened to all students who played any band instrument. Students who play woodwinds would be given tours and information by section leaders of their respective sections in Athletic Band. The Band Staff also decided to remove Fall, Winter, and Spring, from the Athletic Band name, allowing for one continuous band through the year. A new logo, a crest of similar design to the Marching Band crest, was commissioned, and embroidered on new polo shirts. These efforts by the Band Staff have helped to bolster enrollment in the Fall Quarter, as well as continue to provide for a very robust Winter and Spring Quarter band. The 2006 Spring Athletic Band marching in the Kentucky Derby Parade. Beginning in 2011, the athletic department requested that the Men's Basketball Band did not total more than 57 musicians, to maximize the number of seats for spectators. This arrangement made the Band Staff determine in the fall of 2012 that the Men's Basketball Band should once again be an audition band, to allow for the best musicians to perform at those games. In 2012, Ohio State transitioned from quarters to semesters, allowing for only Fall and Spring Bands. The Fall Band began rehearsing twice a week (Fall Band used to rehearse once a week only), and with more emphasis on musicianship, memorization, and choreography, the Athletic Band program has continued to evolve into a highly energetic program that complements the Marching Band throughout the year. The Athletic Band performs at Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and Women's Volleyball, Men's and Women's Ice Hockey, Men's Soccer, Wrestling, the Spring Football Game, an ROTC Pass-In- Review, as well as an annual concert on campus. Typically the Fall Band program numbers around 200 musicians, with the Spring Band often totaling more than 300. The school fight songs‚Äî\\"Buckeye Battle Cry\\" and \\"Fight the Team Across the Field\\"‚Äîwere first performed by the Marching Band in the early 20th century. Other traditional songs performed by the band are the 1960s pop hit \\"Hang on Sloopy\\" and the famous \\"We Don't Give a Damn for the Whole State of Michigan\\", which was popularized by James Thurber in the Broadway production of The Male Animal. Several other popular charts include Al Jarreau's \\"Boogie Down,\\" the Michael Stanley Band's \\"My Town,\\" Royal Crown Revue's \\"Hey, Pachuco!\\" and recent hits such as Adele's \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" and Bruno Mars' \\"Locked Out of Heaven.\\" The Athletic Band performs music of many different styles and genres, which allows for a variety of music to be played at performances, and also allows to expand the musicianship of the performers in the ensemble. Composition Every September, the Marching Band holds tryouts. Roughly 400 or more people try out for the Marching Band's 228 positions. As such, a significant number of musicians are cut. The Band Staff offers all of those cut the opportunity to return to the Band Center the following week to play through various School Songs and popular music pieces. Many students who have committed to moving in early, as well as Columbus-local students, return for these pre school year rehearsals. Marching Band candidates make up a significant proportion of the brass and percussion sections of the Athletic Band. Many students who do not make the Marching Band their first or second year improve their marching and musicianship via the Athletic Band and subsequently make the Marching Band. Many students who tried out for the Marching Band and subsequently join Athletic Band find the atmosphere more to their preference, and stay with Athletic Band. Other students, including most woodwind players, join Athletic Band because of the atmosphere, schedule, and performance opportunities. The Athletic Band is a non-audition band (with the exception of the Men's Basketball Band), meaning any student with previous music experience is allowed to join. In sections such as the Trumpets and Trombones, part placement hearings are held. These do not deny a person the ability to perform, however, it will denote which part they play for that Semester, such as Trumpet 1, 2, or 3, or Trombone 1, 2, or 3. These hearings consist of scales, range exercises, and reading the School Songs. Marching Band members who also play in Athletic Band will often play the same instrument in both, though exceptions have happened in the past. Because of this, some instruments read music that would normally be out of range, such as the E‚ô≠ Cornet, which often plays Alto Saxophone parts an octave higher. Members of the Athletic Band who have not previously been in the Marching Band are eligible to play E‚ô≠ Cornet, Flugelhorn, and Bass Trombone on an individual basis. Typically, Flugelhorns play the 3rd trumpet part, while Bass Trombones may play either specifically written for Bass Trombone, or the lowest trombone part. The band consists of the following instrumentation: * E‚ô≠ Cornets * B‚ô≠ Trumpets * B‚ô≠ Flugelhorns * F Mellophones * B‚ô≠ Trombones * B‚ô≠ Bass Trombones * B‚ô≠ Baritones * B‚ô≠ Sousaphones * C Piccolos * C Flutes * B‚ô≠ Clarinets * E‚ô≠ Alto Saxophones * B‚ô≠ Tenor Saxophones (occasionally) * E‚ô≠ Baritone Saxophones (occasionally) * Snare Drums * Tenor Drums * Bass Drums * Cymbals On occasion, other instruments may show up playing on parts in their natural range. Some instruments that have been in Athletic Band include Oboes, Bassoons, Bass Guitar, concert Tubas, and Marching Brass not normally associated with the Marching Band. For Spring Athletic Band, the band is broken down into a block band for the field performances at the Spring Football Game. The instrumentation of the Spring Band is not modified to fit the block, rather the block is modified to accommodate the number of musicians. For purposes of band quality, and because of a limited number of seats at various athletic events, the band is divided as evenly as possible into two larger bands called Scarlet and Gray, which each compose of one half of the band, as well as numerous other bands, labeled A, B, and C (sometimes even D, E, F, etc.), which are all divided as evenly as possible. The smallest bands typically perform at Women's Basketball and Volleyball Games, so the greatest number of tickets can be available for the numerous fans. The Athletic Band is unique in that there is no limit to the number of Semesters one may spend in the program. The Marching Band only allows for 5 years and completions of the course curriculum, unless there are extenuating circumstances. A student may petition for a sixth year, but unless a year could not be completed for reasons beyond their control: i.e. death in the family, military service, etc. it is rare and almost impossible to be granted a sixth year. Athletic Band has a credit maximum as well. The Band Staff does not limit Athletic Band members to the credit maximum though. Many students choose to take Athletic Band as an audited course (receiving credit hours but no grade), or as an Independent Study course under one of the Band Staff. As such, some students through the years have accumulated 20+ quarters and semesters of seniority in the program (the average four year college student would spend 12 quarters or 8 semesters in the program). Because of the nature of the program, it is also open to PSEOP students (high school juniors and seniors taking college courses on campus), graduate and doctorate level students, the Office of Continuing Education's Senior Program (persons 60+ years of age who qualify for free non-credit courses at OSU), as well as OSU Faculty and Staff. There are some musicians who regularly perform with the band with 25+ quarters and semesters of seniority. The purpose of seniority within the Athletic Band is to select members for tournament trips. NCAA rules set the limit of musicians at any tournament game at 30: 29 musicians plus a director. For Men's Basketball, the band is selected from the 57 members of the Men's Basketball Band based upon seniority and instrumentation. All of the instruments are represented except bass guitar, electric guitar, crash cymbals, and tenor drums. Jon Waters conducts the Men's Basketball tournament band. Out of the rest of the Athletic Band, those with the highest seniority per section are invited to play for the Women's Basketball tournament, directed by Dr. Chris Hoch. Those who do not make that group are invited to perform for the Men's Hockey tournament, directed by one of the graduate assistants. Seniority also assists in picking section leaders, primarily for Spring Band, when the Athletic Band performs a full pre-game and halftime show. Often one member of Athletic Band will be the \\"head\\" squad leader and a member with less seniority, but performs with both the Marching and Athletic Bands, will be \\"assistant\\" squad leader, helping mainly with marching and attendance. Student staff As well as the 200‚Äì300 marching and playing members of the band, there are 14 additional student staff members who do not march. The student staff is responsible for the day-to-day happenings on the student level of the band. There are two head staff members who oversee the student staff. These staff members also work for the Marching Band during the Fall. The 14-member student staff consists of: * Head secretary, two assistant secretaries and one librarian/secretary * Head manager, who oversees two uniform managers, one seamstress, two instrument managers, two record fund managers, and two A/V technicians. All staff members wear the Athletic Band uniform and work throughout the entire school year in the band offices. The student staff is in charge of holding director ladders for stability during field performances. Extra staff members not holding ladders stand along the sidelines to scan the field for wayward hats, mouthpieces, or tuning slides that may fall off during a performance. Traditions Each fall, the Athletic Band is invited to perform at the Homecoming Skull Session with the Marching Band. This showcases the many talented musicians that make up both the Marching and Athletic Bands. The Athletic Band arrives at St. John Arena well before the Marching Band, and plays several pieces for the fans in attendance. Typically, an Ohio high school marching band is also present for these Skull Sessions, and the Athletic Band trades off performances with this high school band. Performances of School Songs and associated traditions show off the common bonds that both bands share, while the diverse selection of music that the Athletic Band plays shows off the differences from the Marching Band. While the Marching Band is required to memorize all show and stand music, and the Athletic Band is not, the Athletic Band will typically play a far greater range of musical genres during an event than the Marching Band does at a typical football game. The 2006 Fall Athletic Band performs at the Homecoming Marching Band Skull Session. The varied instrumentation of the Athletic Band is seen clearly. Script On Ice Script Ohio was first performed by The Ohio State University Marching Band on October 24, 1936 at the Ohio State versus University of Pittsburgh football game. According to The Ohio State University Library, a similar floating formation was first performed during the 1932 season by the University of Michigan Marching band; however, it was a set-piece, instead of being formed in a follow-the-leader style drill. The Script Ohio is the most identifiable trademark associated The Ohio State University Marching and Athletic Bands. It was devised by band director Eugene J. Weigel, who based the looped \\"Ohio\\" script design on the marquee sign of the Loew's Ohio Theatre in downtown Columbus. In the early 2000s (decade), the Athletic Band directing staff, as well as the Athletic Department, realized the wild popularity of the Script Ohio. Having been performed at professional football games, a World Series game, and on the deck of the USS Enterprise, the Athletic Dept wanted to bring this longstanding tradition to new audiences, and asked the Band Staff if it would be possible to create a Script Ohio on an ice rink. The directing staff decided to try it, and an instant hit was created. Members of the Athletic Band put on ice cleats strapped march on the ice between periods of Men's Hockey games, typically a Friday night OSU vs. Michigan or Michigan State hockey game. Because of the dangers of marching on ice, the Script on Ice was highly modified from the Marching Band's counterpart. The full Athletic Band, led by one of the Marching Band's Drum Majors, marches out onto the ice through the visiting team tunnel, at a tempo much slower than the Marching Band's 180 beats per minute. The band turns and faces the home and visitor sides of the arena, playing Buckeye Battle Cry. After a drum roll-off, the band begins playing a shortened version of Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse. Every 32 counts, a section of the block band breaks formation and marches into the shape of the letters in the trademark Script Ohio. The Script on Ice is completed with the traditional dotting of the \\"i.\\" Traditionally, the \\"Ice Dot\\" is reserved for Sousaphone players who have never been in the Sousaphone section of the Marching Band. The rules for an Ice Dot are somewhat relaxed compared to the Marching Band rules. In the Marching Band, dotting the i is an honor reserved only to fourth and fifth year members of the Sousaphone section. Because of this, all fourth years are guaranteed one dot, but quite often they may do multiple dots their fourth and fifth years. In Athletic Band, the Ice Dot eligibility is based on seniority. Once a student dots the ice, they are no longer eligible to dot. This routinely allows for students who may only be in their second or third year of Athletic Band to have an Ice Dot. The Ice Dot tradition varies on the abilities of the individual Sousaphone player: some Sousaphone players attempt to strut, some do the traditional bow, most play the solo during the sung portion of Buckeye Battle Cry, however, all Ice Dotters are led to the place of honor by the Drum Major. After the completion of Script on Ice, the band stands in place and performs a short version of Hang On, Sloopy! and then plays the traditional marching cadence of both the Marching and Athletic Bands, and marches off the ice. As the title of this section suggests, the Athletic Band does not stop at performing Script Ohio at hockey games. Script Ohio's have been performed at many other events, including in the bottom of the unfilled, Olympic size swimming pool at Ohio State's McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion prior to opening. In 2007, Athletics asked if the band would be willing to perform a Script Ohio on the Basketball court at the OSU vs. Wisconsin Men's Basketball game. Because of the limitations of the court, not as many students could participate, but it was wildly popular, and has been a tradition performed at both Men's and Women's Basketball games. In 2012, the Athletic Band performed Script on Ice at the OSU vs. Michigan hockey game held at Progressive Field in Cleveland. St. John Pep Rally Before the Spring Football Game, the Athletic Band performs a concert of their pre-game and halftime music on the grassy knoll outside of St. John Arena. This pep rally is not only designed to pump up fans of Ohio State Athletics, it also functions as a last-minute music rehearsal for the Athletic Band, much in the same fashion that the Skull Session operates for football games and the Marching Band. In 2008, Athletics started adding a Men's Lacrosse game before the Spring Game as a chance to break an NCAA attendance record. While there are not too many opportunities for a band to perform during a lacrosse game, the directors decided to split the band in half. Half of the band would perform a Pep Rally during the first half of the lacrosse game, and the other half during the second half of the game. Because of the decision to add a lacrosse game directly before the Spring Game, it was decided to add a pre- game and halftime show to the lacrosse game as well. The first lacrosse game played at Ohio Stadium to include a pre-game and halftime show was in 2008 when OSU hosted the U.S. Air Force Academy. Spring Football Game The Spring Football Game has been an Ohio State tradition for many years. This pits the football team against itself as a type of public practice, which also gets fans pumped up for the upcoming football season. Since the days of the Military Band, there has been a band to perform a halftime show for the fans. Every year, students studying Marching Band Technique at OSU are given the chance to help write the drill for the pre-game and halftime shows performed by the Athletic Band. Students are often given the chance to arrange music for the halftime show as well. Since 2008, the Athletic Band has performed their pre-game and halftime shows twice: one time each for the lacrosse game, and one time each for the football game immediately following. Both the pre-game and halftime shows require full music memorization, which is checked by section leaders and directing staff. Drill charts for the Athletic Band often are extensively modified on-the-fly since performer numbers are not set. One Spring may have 250 people, and the following year may have 350. Often the drill is simpler than that of the Marching Band, allowing for the fact the rehearsal schedule is only twice a week, as opposed to the Marching Band, which rehearses daily. Musical selections have included Latin, Broadway, Heavy Metal, Big Band, etc. The Athletic Band's show music is as varied as the Marching Band's. Cedar Point and Spring Trips Each year, the Athletic Band is the featured guest of Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio. The Athletic Band performs the opening ceremonies for the first day of the regular season at the amusement park. They are then invited to enjoy the park for a few hours before another mid-day performance, and then the remainder of the afternoon for fun and entertainment. In past years, the band has performed at Cleveland Indians games, the West Virginia Strawberry Festival in Buckhannon, WV, the Indianapolis 500 Parade, and the Kentucky Derby Parade. These performances are typically in the spring, when the Marching Band is no longer rehearsing, leaving the Athletic Band as ambassadors of the university around Ohio and neighboring states.

It was taken over by the Prussian State Railways in 1866. Establishment After the Taunus Railway (Taunus-Eisenbahn) from Frankfurt reached Wiesbaden in 1840, a private company was founded to continue the line along the Rhine. This was originally called the Wiesbaden Railway Company (Wiesbadener Eisenbahngesellschaft); from 1853 it was called the Nassau Rhine Railway Company (Nassauische Rhein Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft); and after 1855 it was called the Nassau Rhine and Lahn Railway Company (Nassauische Rhein- und Lahn Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). The company was given a concession on 23 June 1853 by the Duchy of Nassau for the construction of the Nassau Rhine Valley Railway from Wiesbaden to R√ºdesheim and Oberlahnstein. On 31 March 1857, this was followed by the concession for the Lahn Valley Railway from Oberlahnstein to Wetzlar. Only parts of the 188 kilometres of lines covered by the concession were completed due to insufficient funding. Therefore, on 14 October 1858, the Duchy of Nassau withdrew the company‚Äôs concession and took over operations on the lines. The state formally took over the concession on 2 May 1861 on these lines: *30 km of the Rhine Valley Railway from Wiesbaden via Biebrich to R√ºdesheim *21 km of the Lahn Valley Railway from Oberlahnstein to Nassau. On 20 November 1861, the company was reconstituted as the Nassau State Railway.Karl Friedrich Walbrach: Leben und Wirken des Eisenbahnplaners Moritz Hilf (1819-1894). In: Nassauische Annalen 112 (2001) 388. The Nassau State Railway completed the 56.6 km long gap in the Rhine Valley line between R√ºdesheim and Oberlahnstein on 22 February 1862. The remaining 78 km of the Lahn Valley Railway to Wetzlar was completed in three sections on 10 January 1863. This work was directed by the railway surveyor and engineer, Moritz Hilf. Connections to other lines  In Wiesbaden the Nassau state railway connected with the Taunus Railway from Frankfurt to Wiesbaden, opened in 1839 and 1840. At the end of the Lahn Valley line in Wetzlar, it connected with the Deutz-Giessen line completed in 1862 by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn). In order to make a connection in the Rhine Valley with other rail companies, there were two subsequent concessions: *The Bingerbr√ºck‚ÄìR√ºdesheim train ferry was opened between Rudesheim and Bingen in 1862, connecting the line to the Rhine-Nahe Railway Company‚Äôs (Rhein-Nahe-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) Nahe Valley Railway. This created a freight connection between the Rhine-Main and Saar areas and opened a new market for Saar coal. The ferry carried freight wagons until 1900. *A concession was granted to connect Oberlahnstein with the Rhenish Railway Company‚Äôs (Rheinischen Eisenbahngesellschaft), requiring bridges over the Lahn and the Rhine. A train ferry connected Oberlahnstein with the Rhenish Railway‚Äôs West Rhine line (Linke Rheinstrecke) at K√∂nigsbach station for two years from the second half of 1862. It primarily served the transport of ore from the Lahn valley and the supply of industry in the Lahn valley with Ruhr coal. The Pfaffendorf Bridge over the Rhine at Pfaffendorf (Koblenz) and the bridge over the Lahn between Niederlahnstein and Oberlahnstein were put into operation on 3 June 1864. Takeover by Prussia  With the end of the Duchy as an independent state as a result of the Austro-Prussian War, the Nassau State Railway was absorbed by the Prussian State Railways. An attempt by the Rhenish Railway Company, to take over the Nassau State Railway and to operate the planned extension along the Rhine failed because of the demands of the Prussian state. Since Prussia's budget was strained by the war, it made the sale of the railway conditional on the simultaneous takeover of the loss- making Rhine-Nahe Railway Company. The Rhenish Railway Company was not willing to take over the Rhine-Nahe Railway Company, which would have undermined the profitability of its Eifel line, then under construction. The Prussian State Railway preserved the organisation of the former Nassau State Railway and it was initially an independent division, based in Wiesbaden. Following the nationalisation of the Prussian private railways, its assets were incorporated in 1880 in the Prussian State Railway's Frankfurt am Main division.

Although the Muslim Umayyads secured control of Septimania, their incursions beyond this into the Loire and Rh√¥ne valleys failed. By 759 they had lost Septimania to the Christian Franks. The invasion of Gaul was a continuation of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania into the region of Septimania, the last remnant of the Visigothic Kingdom north of the Pyrenees. After the fall of Narbonne, the capital of the Visigothic rump state, in 720, Umayyad armies composed of Arabs and Berbers turned north against Aquitaine. Their advance was stopped at the Battle of Toulouse in 721, but they sporadically raided southern Gaul as far as Avignon, Lyon and Autun. A major Umayyad raid directed at Tours was defeated in the Battle of Tours in 732. After 732, the Franks asserted their authority in Aquitaine and Burgundy, but only in 759 did they manage to take the Mediterranean region of Septimania, due to Muslim neglect and local Gothic disaffection. Umayyad conquest of Septimania By 716, under the pressure of the Umayyad Caliphate from the south, the Kingdom of the Visigoths had been rapidly reduced to the province of Narbonensis (Septimania), a region which corresponds approximately to the modern Languedoc-Roussillon. In 713 the Visigoths of Septimania elected Ardo as king. He ruled from Narbonne. In 717, the Umayyads under al-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi crossed the Pyrenees for the first time on a reconnaissance mission. The following campaign of conquest in Septimania lasted three years. Late Muslims sources, such as al- Maqqari, describe Musa ibn Nusayr (712‚Äì714) as leading an expedition to the Rh√¥ne at the far east of the Visigothic kingdom, but these are not reliable. The next Umayyad governor, al-Samh, crossed the Pyrenees in 719 and conquered Narbonne (Arbuna to the Arabs) in that year or the following (720). According to the Chronicle of Moissac, the inhabitants of the city were slaughtered. The fall of the city ended the seven-year reign of Ardo and with it the Visigothic kingdom, but Visigothic nobles continued to hold the Septimanian cities of Carcassonne and N√Æmes. Nevertheless, al-Samh established garrisons in Septimania (721), intending to incorporate it permanently into al-Andalus. However, the Umayyad tide was temporarily halted in the large-scale Battle of Toulouse (721), when al-Samh (Zama to the Christian chronicles) was killed by Odo of Aquitaine. In general terms the Gothic Septimania surrendered to the Muslims in favourable conditions for them, allowing the Umayyads to rule the region with the conditioned support of the local population and the Gothic nobles. In 725, his successor, Anbasa ibn Suhaym al-Kalbi, besieged the city of Carcassonne, which had to agree to give half of its territory, pay tribute, and make an offensive and defensive alliance with Muslim forces. Nimes and all the other main Septimanian cities fell too under the sway of the Umayyads. In the 720s the savage fighting, the massacres and destruction particularly affecting the Ebro valley and Septimania unleashed a flow of refugees who mainly found shelter in southern Aquitaine across the Pyrenees, and Provence. Sometime during this period, the Berber commander Uthman ibn Naissa (\\"Munuza\\") became governor of the Cerdanya (also including a large swathe of present-day Catalonia). By that time, resentment against Arab rulers was growing within the Berber troops. Raid into Aquitaine and Poitou Umayyad Hispania in 732, Septimania is to the northeast, around Carcassonne Uthman ibn Naissa's revolt By 725, all of Septimania was under Umayyad rule. Uthman ibn Naissa, the Pyrenean Berber lord ruler of the eastern Pyrenees, detached from Cordova, establishing a principality based on a Berber power base (731). The Berber leader allied with the Aquitanian duke Odo, who was eager to stabilize his borders, and is reported to have married Odo's daughter Lampegia. Uthman ibn Naissa went on to kill Nambaudus, the bishop of Urgell, an official acting on the orders of the Church of Toledo. The new Umayyad governor in Cordova, Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, mustered an expedition to punish the Berber commander's insubordination, surrounding and putting him to death in Cerdanya, according to the Mozarabic Chronicler, a just retribution for killing the Gothic bishop. Umayyad expedition over Aquitaine Emboldened by his success, he attacked Uthman ibn Naissa's Aquitanian ally Duke Odo, who had just encountered Charles Martel's devastating offensive on Bourges and northern Aquitaine (731). Still managing to recruit the necessary number of soldiers, the independent Odo confronted al-Ghafiqi's forces that had broken north by the western Pyrenees, but could not hold back the Arab commander's thrust against Bordeaux. The Aquitanian leader was beaten at the Battle of the River Garonne in 732. The Umayyad force then moved north to invade Poitou in order to plunder the Basilica of Saint-Martin-de-Tours. Battle of Poitiers (732) Odo still found the opportunity to save his grip on Aquitaine by warning the rising Frankish commander Charles of the impending danger against the Frankish sacred city of Tours. Umayyad forces were defeated in the Battle of Poitiers in 732, considered by many the turning point of Muslim expansion in Gaul. With the death of Odo in 735 and after putting down the Aquitanian detachment attempt led by duke Hunald, Charles Martel went on to deal with Burgundy (734, 736) and the Mediterranean south of Gaul (736, 737). Expansion to Provence and Charles Martel Departure of Umayyad troops from Narbonne to P√©pin le Bref, in 759, after 40 years of occupation. Still, in 734, Umayyad forces (called \\"Saracens\\" by the Europeans at the time) under Abd el-Malik el Fihri, Abd al- Rahman's successor, received without a fight the submission of the cities of Avignon, Arles, and probably Marseille, ruled by count Maurontus. The patrician of Provence had called Andalusi forces in to protect his strongholds from the Carolingian thrust, maybe estimating his own garrisons too weak to fend off Charles Martel's well-organised, strong army made up of vassi enriched with Church lands. Charles faced the opposition of various regional actors. To begin with the Gothic and Gallo-Roman nobility of the region, who feared his aggressive and overbearing policy. Charles decided to ally with the Lombard King Liutprand in order to repel the Umayyads and the regional nobility of Gothic and Gallo-Roman stock. He also underwent the hostility of the dukes of Aquitaine, who jeopardized Charles' and his successor Pepin's rearguard (737, 752) during their military operations in Septimania and Provence. The dukes of Aquitaine in turn largely relied on the strength of the Basque troops, acting on a strategic alliance with the Aquitanians since mid-7th century. In 737, Charles captured and reduced Avignon to rubble, besides destroying the Umayyad fleet. Charles' brother, Childebrand, failed however in the siege of Narbonne. Charles attacked several other cities which had collaborated with the Umayyads, and destroyed their fortifications: Beziers, Agde, Maguelone, Montpellier, Nimes. Before his return to the northern Francia, Charles had managed to crush all opposition in Provence and Lower Rhone. Count Maurontus of Marseille fled to the Alps. Loss of Septimania Muslims reasserted their authority over Septimania for another 15 years. However, in 752, the newly proclaimed King Pepin, the son of Charles, led a new campaign into Septimania, when regional Gothic allegiances were shifting in favour of the Frankish king. That year, Pepin conquered Nimes and went on to subdue most of Septimania up to the gates of Narbonne. In his quest to subdue the Muslim Gothic Septimania, Charles had found the opposition of another actor, the Duke of Aquitaine. The Duke Waiffer, aware of Pepin's expansionist ambitions, is recorded as attacking him on the rearguard with an army of Basques during the siege of Narbonne. It was ultimately the Frankish king who managed to take Narbonne in 759, after vowing to respect the Gothic law and earning the allegiance of the Gothic nobility and population, thus marking the end of the Muslim presence in southern Gaul. Furthermore, Pepin directed all his war effort against the Duchy of Aquitaine immediately after subduing Roussillon. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, fulfilled the Frankish goal of extending the defensive boundaries of the empire beyond Septimania and the Pyrenees, creating a strong barrier state between the Umayyad Emirate and Francia. This buffer zone known as the \\"Spanish March\\" would become a focus for the Reconquista. Legacy Arabic words were borrowed, such as tordjman (translator) which became drogoman in Proven√ßal, and is still in use in the expression \\"par le truchement de\\"; charaha (to discuss), which became \\"charabia\\". Some place names were also derived from Arabic or in memory of past Muslim inhabitance, such as Ramatuelle and Saint-Pierre de l'Almanarre (from al-manar i.e. 'the lighthouse').

Domscheit-Berg apparently told weekly Der Freitag that \\"I took no documents from WikiLeaks with me\\", leading to suspension of mediations. Domscheit-Berg was eventually kicked out of Chaos Computer Club due to his conduct during the mediation and for requesting the Chaos Computer Club to test OpenLeaks' security. This decision was revoked in February 2012 by the general assembly of the Chaos Computer Club. WikiLeaks and other sources later confirmed the destruction of over 3500 unpublished whistleblower communications with some communications containing hundreds of documents, including the US government's No Fly List, 5 GB of Bank of America leaks, insider information from 20 neo nazi organizations and proof of torture and government abuse of a Latin American country. OpenLeaks In December 2010, Domscheit-Berg announced the intention to start a site named \\"OpenLeaks\\" with the intention of being more transparent than WikiLeaks. \\"In these last months, the WikiLeaks organization has not been open any more. It lost its open-source promise.\\" Instead of publishing the documents, Domscheit-Berg said that his proposed OpenLeaks process would send the leaked documents to various news entities or publishers.Greenberg, Andy, \\"WikiLeaks' Stepchildren\\", Forbes, 17 January 2011, p. 20. OpenLeaks was supposed to start public operations in January 2011. However, on 23 December 2012 Domscheit-Berg announced on the website that the organisation would not go ahead as previously intended and would now only focus on spreading information and expertise regarding how to set up and run leak websites rather than directly facilitating leaks themselves.

Egg on Nezara viridula head. Life cycle Trichopoda pennipes first appears in the late spring or early summer and feeds on nectar sucked from flowers such as Queen Anne's lace and meadowsweet. It may be seen hovering over other plants in search of suitable bugs on which to lay its eggs, most commonly squash bugs and southern green stinkbugs. The female fly lays several small, pale-coloured, oval eggs on a large nymph or an adult bug. In fact the larvae are parasitoids of several true bugs, particularly squash bugs and leaf-footed bugs in the family Coreidae (including the large-sized Leptoglossus occidentalis), stinkbugs in the family Pentatomidae and other pentatomorph bugs (Largidae and Scutelleridae species). When the eggs hatch, the larvae burrow into the bug. If there are several larvae in one host, only one survives. After feeding on the bug's tissues, the cream-coloured larva emerges and falls to the ground where it pupates in a reddish-brown puparium formed from the last larval skin. The bug meanwhile dies. After about two weeks, an adult fly emerges from the pupa. After mating, a female fly may lay several hundred eggs in total. There are up to three generations of the fly each year and the parasitoid overwinters as a second instar larva within the body of the overwintering host.Hoffmann, M.P. and Frodsham, A.C. Natural Enemies of Vegetable Insect Pests. (1993) Cooperative Extension, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. Use in biological control Trichopoda pennipes is used as a biological control agent for agricultural pests. One of the principal host species for T. pennipes is the southern green stinkbug, Nezara viridula. This is a crop pest that originated in Ethiopia but now has a worldwide distribution and is named for the foul-smelling defensive secretion it exudes from a gland on its thorax. This exudate appears to be fairly effective in preventing predation by birds but is well tolerated by T. pennipesEisner, T., Eisner, M. and Siegler, M. Secret Weapons: Defenses of Insects, Spiders, Scorpions, and Other Many-Legged Creatures. (2005) Belknap Press which seems to be highly attracted by an aggregation pheromone produced by the male bugs. This results in a higher proportion of males being parasitised than females. There seem to be different biotypes across the United States, preying on different hosts in different regions. In northern California, a population of the fly parasitised the bordered plant bug, Largus succinctus, but did not attack the squash bug, Anasa tristis. In an experiment, T. pennipes was collected from squash fields in New York State and released near squash fields in California. The insects targeted the squash bugs and established permanent populations. Their eggs are now found deposited on nearly 50% of the squash bugs in the area but it is unclear how effective this is in controlling the crop pests. On the southern green stink bug, the rate of parasitism can be as high as 93% and up to 80% on the squash bug. However, T. pennipes does not prevent all crop damage as the bugs continue to feed and reproduce after being parasitised, though the reproductive organs begin to atrophy when the parasitoid reaches the second instar stage. Control of the pest is more effective when nymphs are parasitised since half of these die before becoming adults and any that overwinter will die before laying eggs.

It bore the name Berthelot before independence and had the name Daoud after independence. It is a mainly agricultural region situated in a forested area. During the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, many inhabitants of the rural areas of the Saida region and even from Sidi-bel-abb√®s fled their villages to live in the commune of Youb and many of them have remained there without returning to their homes, although they have benefited from State aid to restart their agricultural activities. Part of the forest of Sidi Douma located in the commune was ravaged by a major fire in June 2005.

It is situated in the northwestern part of the country, in the Hauts Plateaux region, and has a typical Mediterranean climate. Established as an official commune on April 15, 1886, A√Øn El Berd is known for its beautiful countryside views and sites, as well as for its vineyards, olive trees, and wheat products. During the French colonial era, the surrounding areas, then called Saint-Marc and Saint-Henri, gave wines of good quality, and in 1889 and 1900 won silver and gold medals, respectively.  Settlements  A√Øn El Berd Commune consists of two main settlements: * A√Øn El Berd - with a population of 12,179 is the capital of A√Øn El Berd commune. The colonial name was \\"Oued-Imbert\\", which is a contraction of its name Oued A√Øn El Berd. Before the French colonial era, A√Øn El Berd was inhabited by the tribe of Ouled Sidi Ma'√¢chou. It is situated 25 km from Sidi Bel Abb√®s and 57 km from Oran on national highway N13. * Ouled Ali - population of 3,487.  Demographics  During the French colonial era, the area around A√Øn El Berd from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abb√®s was heavily populated with French colonists, sometimes referred to as Pied-Noir. After the massacre of Pieds-Noirs in Oran by the suburban Muslim population in which European people were shot, molested and brought to Petit-Lac slaughterhouse where they were tortured and executed, the Pied-Noir exodus began in earnest. By September 1962, cities such as Oran and Sidi Bel Abb√®s were half-empty. Despite losing so many people in the Pied-Noir exodus, the region is currently rebounding. The population of the commune in 1933 was 41,645. In 1998 the population was 13,779. And according to the 2008 census, the population was 16,013.

Located in a country side, the town is heavily surrounded by farms and large fields mostly consisting of wheat and olive trees. The town was originally named after Mr.TASSIN who stopped at the stagecoach relay of Hassi-Zehana in 1883.  History  In 1883, a French official, Mr. TASSIN, director of civil affairs for Admiral de Gueydon traveling from Tlemcen to Sidi-Bel-Abb√®s , stopped at the stagecoach relay at Hassi-Zehana \\"Auberge du Roulage\\". This then included only a well dug by engineering, at the time of the conquest of 1830, a Moorish cafe (modest hut of brushwood) and \\"L'Auberge du roulage\\", the only European construction of the place.  Colonization center  Having noticed the magnificent plain surrounding the site, the official informed the Governor of Algeria of his discovery. The following year, he took the decision to install a colonization center there which soon took the name of TASSIN. The land was bought from the native owners and divided into 110 lots, of which 4 were granted to French people in Algeria and 65 to French people from mainland France from the Garonne, Massif Central and Rh√¥ne regions, including 9 Hermillon families. TASSIN - Main Street Creation of the village In Hermillon, a small mountain village, life was very rough at that time. Winter is endless, the harvest uncertain, life difficult. In 1888, Mr. SERAIN the teacher, often listened to the complaints of these fellow citizens, when the inhabitants met at school, the evening after supper. The women talked about their household chores, the men asked the teacher for advice. They complained about their fate, lamented the climate, cursing the snow that covered the whole country, preventing them from picking up the grass essential for their dairy cows. \\"Why don't you go to Algeria?\\" one day the teacher told them. The idea took shape and one day in April 1889, Monsieur SERAIN and a resident of Hermillon set off in recognition of the other side of the Mediterranean. The concession requests having been accepted, 9 families from the village, 65 people (26 adults and 39 children) were designated for the settlement of TASSIN. Leaving provisionally women and children, the men left on December 2, 1889 The teacher and his family joined them a few days later. Arriving in a torrential rain, the newcomers had to stay in gourbis and wooden huts. The following January, the Savoyards began to build their dwellings: four large yellow walls with a frame covered with tiles and a chimney in a corner, 8 meters long by 5 meters wide and 3.5 meters high. A unique piece that served as a kitchen, living room and bedroom. They organized a raising of chickens and dairy goats behind the houses. The surrounding land was made up of holm oaks, jujube trees, carob trees, wild olive trees, dwarf palm trees that had to be cleared. This work was carried out by experienced Spanish charcoal burners. A beautiful red clay- limestone soil appeared and cultivation began. In 1895 TASSIN had become a fully-fledged commune and in 1900 there were over 200 houses there. In the main street shaded by plane trees, shops opened their doors and administrations began to set up. The 300 original settlers had become a thousand and among them there were 87 people from Hermillon.  Places of interest  TASSIN-Old Wine factory.  Wine Factory (The cooperative cellar)  alt= Probably one of the well known places in town, The wine factory is an essential piece of town's history.This building is located near the west entrance. The cooperative cellar was created in 1932. It had the particularity of being equipped with centrifugal pumps which allow handling from 300 to 400 hecto-hours. It was particularly designed to make quality wine, thanks to the variety of grape types brought by them. cooperative, local and fruity which were the specialties of the wine of the region. Its creation had allowed the storage and vinification of grapes belonging to winegrowers who did not have a personal cellar. Its capacity was 49,000 hectoliters. It is Mister GAGNET, the winemaker and wine merchant, who since the foundation of the Cooperative has been handling the wines. The dedicated and competent Board of Directors is chaired by Mr. GRANIE.

The Grand Prince, first-born son of King Taejong of the Joseon dynasty and his consort Queen Wongyeong, elder brother of Sejong the Great, and ancestor of Syngman Rhee, Korean independence activist and first President of South Korea. Biography He was born as Yi Je (ÊùéË§Ü in Hanja, Ïù¥Ï†ú in Hangul) in 1394. Originally his father appointed him as the Crown Prince but he eventually executed the Queen Wongyeong's brothers and in the 18th year of his reign replaced prince Yangnyeong with his third son prince Chungnyeong as his successor https://books.google.com/books?id=p3yW5MdzKnUC&pg;=PA49&dq;=Yangnyeong&hl;=ru&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjIovjtvPLeAhWSlIsKHeNECdAQ6AEITTAF#v=onepage&q;=Yangnyeong&f;=false . Known for his literature and calligraphy skills, the former Crown Prince viewed himself as lacking in the requisite skills for kingship and believed that Sejong was destined to become king. Considering it his duty to make Sejong king, he purposely acted extremely rude in the court, lost his position as a prince, married a peasant and was eventually officially banished from Seoul in June 1418. Grand Prince Hyoryeong, Yangnyeong's second brother, had similar feelings about Sejong being king, and so became a monk in a Buddhist temple. Possibly King Tajong's willingness to execute troublesome family members helped encourage his first two sons to step aside and allow King Taejong's third and favorite son to become King Sejong. This plot ultimately brought Sejong to the throne. Later, Yangnyeong became a wandering traveler and lived in the mountains.Naver Encyclopedia, \\"ÏñëÎÖïÎåÄÍµ∞ [ËÆìÂØßÂ§ßÂêõ, 1394~1462]\\", Naver\\" After Sejong had taken the throne, the relationship between the brothers was strong, and Sejong often invited Yangnyeong to the palace. Yangnyeong lived as a wanderer and died in 1462, almost living for 68 years.Naver Encyclopedia, \\"ÏñëÎÖïÎåÄÍµ∞ [ËÆìÂØßÂ§ßÂêõ, 1394~1462]\\", Naver\\" The tomb of Prince Yangneong was reopened in 2018 to the public after 18 years of closure.

History The town was going to be named \\"Meslen el-kebch\\" (spine sheep) but the notable of the city decided to not adopt it, concerning the current name of the city in base it's el arrouche ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±Ÿàÿ¥ which in some sorts refers to tribes . Located halfway between the ancient Cirta (Constantine) and the ancient Skikda, the history of El Harrouch remains strongly linked to the two major urban centers. There is however very little information about the area before the Roman occupation, though pre Roman tombstones, shine some light on that period. When the French troops arrived in El Harrouch, the remains of the Roman road from Stora to Cirta were still visible and usable. It was by following this ribbon of stones that the battalions arrived on the coast. In 1838, the first military detachments settled permanently in El Harrouch where four bastions, ensured the defense of the camp. The first settlers arrived soon after. Twice the Government had to repopulate this settlement center, the colonists having been decimated by cholera and earthquakes. The settlement of El Harrouch was mainly Belgian and German families. The commune of El Harrouch was created by decree of 28 August 1881. Ali Kafi Algerian President (1992-1994) was born in the town and Khaled el-Hassani ben el-Hashemi was married there.

It revolves around Shibnath Roychoudhury a very successful businessman who can goes to any length to make his way smooth and his younger son Bishwanath Roy Chowdhury who opposes him since the latter dwells on humanity and morality. The film stars Pradeep Kumar, Nirmal Kumar, Supriya Devi, Kushal Chakraborty, Chumki Chowdhury, Rituparna Sengupta, Pallavi Chatterjee, Kaushik Banerjee, Manoj Mitra, Mita Chatterjee and Kabir Suman. The film brought back Kushal Chakraborty and Rituparna Sengupta together 12 years after they had collaborated in Shishir Majumdar's Bengali family drama Shesh Chithi (1994). Plot Amar Mallick and Shibnath Roy Choudhury are business partners. While Amar is honest, Shibnath is dishonest. The latter depends on the advice of the beguiling advocate J. B. Ganguly but fears Amar's wrath since he knows that Amar may turn hostile at him if he ever discovers his illegal practice. Ganguly advised Shibnath to get Debu, the elder son of the latter married to Sanjukta, the only daughter of Amar. Shibnath believes that Amar will never turn hostile if a connubial relationship is formed between them. Debu and Sanjukta marry but Shibnath's perception turns out erroneous when Amar again threatens him against his illegal practice. He seeks help from Ganguly and the latter gets Amar assassinated by his concubine Monika. Shibnath sells the colony of the workers of his factory to a promoter named Jalan. Jaya, the daughter of Subal who is a worker at the factory implores Bishwanath Roy Choudhury, the younger son of Shibnath Roy Choudhury to restrain Jalan from embezzling the colony. Bishwanath meets Jalan and succeeds to change Jalan's mind. Bishwanath visits J. B. Ganguly and tells him that he suspects him to the assassinator of Amar. Ganguly instructs Monika to get Bishwanath assassinated. Ganguly's daughter Mithu who is in love with Bishwanath overhears this. She rushes to Bishwanath and warms him against her father. This is overheard by Shibnath who at once goes to Ganguly's place and shoots him.

The reservoir and its peripheral areas provide for recreation facilities such as boating, surfing, golfing, etc. and has a hotel on its bank. There is a fishery development in the reservoir supported by a hatchery on its banks. Irrigation and hydropower developments have also been planned from the stored waters of the reservoir. Location The dam is about west of Kabul and is built on the Paghman River. Features Qargha Reservoir The dam was built in 1933. It has a height of . The dam length is and top width is . A sluice gate of the dam which was damaged has since been restored. The reservoir water spread area behind the dam is . The reservoir was developed for the purpose of recreation in the 1950s when Daud was the President of the country. It is now a popular picnic location, particularly on Friday's when it is visited by a large number of picnickers. During the Seventh Fiver Plan of the country, the stored water from the dam was planned for supplementing drinking water to Kabul city. An irrigation canal is proposed to be built from the dam, and survey for the same has been completed from the dam up to Badambagh. This canal is proposed for providing irrigation and expand horticulture. The reservoir has been developed for trout fishing with a hatchery set up close to the reservoir. As part of recreation, apart from the lake side upscale Spojhmai hotel, there is a 9-hole golf course at the extreme periphery of the reservoir. A new hydrological station has been set up since 2008 at the location of the reservoir for planning of water resources development as part of the network of 174 hydrological stations and 60 snow gauges and meteorological stations proposed in the country. This project is funded by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). As part of future planning for alternate sources of energy, utilization of the stored waters of the reservoir and the drop available in the dam has been studied. There was a terrorist attack by the Taliban at the hotel on the edge of the reservoir on 22 June 2012, as it was suspected that it was one of the main centres of prostitution and partying in Kabul. Twenty people including security personnel and the terrorists were killed in the encounter. Fish hatchery The reservoir feeds a fish hatchery and stocks the rainbow trout fingerlings. The hatchery was set up in 1967 close to the dam and draws water from this reservoir. The hatchery was established in the 1970s when 30,000 trout fingerlings were produced and then stocked in the Qargha Reservoir and in many other rivers such as Panjsher, Bamian, Salang and Sarde. The objective of stocking in the reservoir was meant as a recreational fishing activity under licensed sport fishing. Under UNDP/FAO assistance the hatchery was rehabilitated in 1987, and during 1988-89 egg incubators were repaired and set up with new egg trays to restart production. Eggs were imported from Denmark in 1988. These were stocked in the floating cages moored in the reservoir so that fishes grew into marketable size. Concrete raceways adjoining the farm were also repaired and put to use. In 1989, the fish farm was capable of producing 10 tons of rainbow trout. However, subsequently production was affected due to terrorist activity. In 2013, USAID suspended the project claiming that the local governor failed to pay 1.1 million Dollars for the %10 of the costs agreed. Planning for Hydropower development US Army Corps of Engineers in their studies for \\"Potential Renewable Energy Technologies in Northwest Kabul\\", have examined utilization of the storage of Quarga reservoir and the head created by the dam. Two alternatives have been studied. In the first alternative the head available at the dam location of about below the dam could generate power of 26 KW with regulated releases from the dam giving an annual energy generation of 227,760 kWh. In the second alternative a head of could be created over a distance of from the dam which could be utilized for power generation of 103 KW with energy generation of 902,280 kWh, drawing water from the reservoir through a penstock pipe line.

His job was to intensify propaganda against the terrorists and to the public, through his position as Chief News Editor of Radio Malaya. After Sir Henry Gurney, his main support, was assassinated in an ambush on 6 October 1951, his services were 'no longer required' and his contract was not renewed. Turning to freelancing for the Singapore Standard, he gained the permanent position of News Controller for Radio Singapore in 1951. It was while in this position he became friends with Lee Kuan Yew. According to Josey, it was because he put on the radio the strikers' arguments (strike in 1951) for the first time which infuriated the British colonial people, and amused Lee, which sparked their friendship. In July 1952, Josey along with De Goh Keng Swee and Kenny Byrne formed the short-lived Council of Join Action. By 1954 he had become a full- time Journalist for the Singapore Standard. Singapore became part of Malaysia in 1963, and in 1965 Josey was served with a banishment order by the Malaysian Government for \\"interfering with the internal politics of Malaysia\\" and was told to leave Singapore by 19 July 1965.

The dispute was won by Bonville and thus Blackborough descended by the great heiress Cecily Bonville (1460-1529) to her grandson Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, 3rd Marquess of Dorset (1517‚Äì1554). On the attainder of the latter in 1554, the estate escheated to the crown, and was sold to Sir John Wyndham, of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset.Pole, p.195 Blackborough House Blackborough is home to the Grade II listed building Blackborough House. This was built in 1838 by George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont. Originally designed as an Italianate palace, there were no funds to complete it on this scale, so it was constructed as two smaller, linked buildings. The house was variously used as a school, a religious institution for wayfarers and for training conscientious objectors for relief work As of 2016, the house is semi-derelict but has been purchased by a developer who plans to restore it and turn it into an events venue.

At the end of the reign of Ali Ben Yo√ªsof in 1192, the Masmo√ªda already had formidable forces. Heading eastwards, the Almohad (ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ≠ÿØŸàŸÜ in Arabic) troops commanded by Abd El Moumen Ben Ali arrived at the mountains of Tlemcen. In Spain, as in the Maghreb, the Almoravids were unable to resist the Almohads. Only the \\"veiled men\\" who held the Balearics escaped: the Beni Ghanya, who will play a not insignificant role in the history of Algeria. Ibn To√ªmert, known as El-Mahdi, was the precursor of the Almohad movement. A disciple of the theologian Ghazali, this reformer wanted to apply the precepts of his master in the West. Everywhere he censures abuses and captivates listeners by his eloquence. It bears controversy in the field of theology, whereas the Almoravids made jurisprudence, their weapon of combat. His followers; The \\"Al-Muwahhidun\\" (Unitarians) professed the dogma of the unity of God in all its purity. Ibn To√ªmert will meet Abd El Moumen near Bougie (present Beja√Øa), during his trip to the Orient (1117). The Master of the Under recognized in him the predestined man: \\"The mission on which the life of religion will rest will triumph only by Abd El Moumen, the torch of the Almohades.http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/T228508/ABD_AL_MU_MIN.htm Abd El Moumen led three campaigns that led to the unification of North Africa [ref. necessary]. From this period dates the first cadastre of North Africa in 1159, Abd El Moumen ordered the surveying of Ifriqiyya and the Maghreb. Measurements were made from the Cyrenaica to the Wadi N'un, from one to the other. From this surface one third was cut off for mountains, rivers, salt lakes, roads and deserts. The remaining two-thirds were stricken with the Kharadj or land tax. This was a great innovation. The sovereign Almohads of the Maghreb enjoyed great prestige both in the East and in the West. However, the Almohad Empire, plagued by internal struggles for power and the difficulty of governing such a vast empire, began its decline. It was first Spain, which escaped the Almohad caliphate, followed by the Hafsides in 1229 (present-day Tunisia), Tlemcen with the Zianides in 1235 (current Algeria), and the Merinids in 1269 (present Morocco) who took Marrakech. This was the end of the Almohad dynasty. Thus the Almohad dynasty reigned over North Africa and half of Spain from 1147 to 1269.

History  In 1927 the watering trough and the semicircular basin which occupied the crossroads of the two main roads disappeared and were replaced by the Monument to the Dead of the War of 1914‚Äì1918, which marked the town center of Marengo Hadjout. In 1848, the village was named Marengo. In 1958, the commune became part of the department of Algiers. After Algerian independence, it was renamed Hadjout. Marengo was founded on September 17, 1848; the plan of the village was signed by the captain of the genius Victor de Malglaive on December 29, 1849. By decree of February 11, 1851 that Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, French, Signa, this village of colonists was given the name of Marengo, to honor the dedication of Colonel Gaspard, Joseph, Marie Caponne (1787-1862) who participated in the Napoleonic and Algerian conquests.  Transport  Hadjout has a large bus station providing inter-wilayas links, plus an urban railway station, which guarantees connections between Hadjout and other localities. The road transport network of the municipality consists essentially of three national roads: the national road 42, linking Nador to the north and To the southeast, National Road 42A to reach Boumedfaa to the south, and National Route 67 Algeria, the main road to the north-east Kol√©a and further on Tessala El Merdja.  Demography  In 1926, Marengo counted 5217 inhabitants, of which 1200 were of European origin. The population then increased rapidly due to the birth rate of ethnic Algerians, the attraction of the center, and then external events that caused both a European and Algerian influx to the town, considered a safer place. At the 1954 census, the commune counted 13,400 inhabitants, including 122 foreigners and 10822 Algerians. In 1960, according to the figures communicated by Mr. Frachon, there were about 19,500 inhabitants, 3,500 Europeans and 16,000 Algerian Muslims. The Europeans had a total of 812 families (average 3.10 people per family) the Muslims 2444 (average 4.52 people per family). The density of the population is then 125.76 inhabitants per square kilometer. After the independence of Algeria in 1962, the municipality was renamed Hadjout (named after a local tribe) and counted 10000 inhabitants. At the 1998 census, the commune of Hadjout had 44,065 residents. In 2008, the population of the commune was 48,561.  Economy  Hadjout is known mainly for its agricultural side, it is one of the most important cities of the Metidja. A daily market with an area of 11500 m 2 attracts the clientele of the surrounding wilayas, it stands at the western exit of the city. A communal covered market was built during the colonial period in 1935. Apart from the agricultural side, it also has an important industrial zone for the region at the northern exit of the city, and several dealers of vehicles of the major French, Japanese, Korean and Chinese brands have settled in the city.  Sport  Stade 5 Juillet 1962 in Hadjout. The city's sports infrastructure consists mainly of a football stadium built during the colonial era.

This agricultural locality is a hundred kilometers (62 mi) distant of Algiers. Novi, renowned for its fertile soil, vineyards and wines, is located by the sea. It is a modern village despite its traditionally typical so-called \\"colonization\\" villages with its well-traced streets, airy, lined with houses and villas resplendent with whiteness. Novi agricultural colony, originally managed by the military authority, was founded by decree of the National Assembly of 19 September 1848 and by order of the Minister of War Louis Juchault de Lamorici√®re (1806-1865) on September 27 of the same year. It's one of the first 7 centers of colonization created in Algeria. Names After the independence of Algeria on July 5, 1962, the town of Novi became known as Sidi Ghiles.  History  Inhabitation Located in the middle of charming vineyards of Algeria, and situated between the sea and mountains, Sidi Ghiles is one of the prettiest villages in the region. The initial population of Novi was mainly made up of the political deportees of 1848, this center became an annex of Cherchell. It was, then, a municipality that covered an area of 1647 hectares with a population of 1047 inhabitants including 423 French. Most of the other inhabitants were native Berbers indigenous to the surrounding hills and Atlas Mountains. In 1903, Mayor L√©on Roseau gave Novi a school group; in 1908 some owners grouped themselves to create a cooperative cellar of 5,000 hectares whose notoriety has crossed the borders of North Africa.Histoire d'un village d'Alg√©rie : Novi, coloniale agricole de 1848 par Henri Roseau (p22) The Department The department of Algiers is one of the French departments of Algeria, which existed between 1848 and 1962. Considered a French province, Algeria was departmentalized on December 9, 1848. The departments created in this date was the civil zone of the three provinces corresponding to the Beyliks of the regency of Algiers recently conquered. Therefore, the city of Algiers was made prefecture of the department bearing its name, then covering the center of Algeria, leaving to the east the department of Constantine and to the west the department of Oran. On January 28, 1956, an administrative reform to take account of the strong demographic growth experienced by the country, amputated the department of Algiers from its hinterland and thus creating May 20, 1957, three additional departments: the department of Medea, the department of Orleansville and the department of Tizi Ouzou. The District of Cherchell, in the department of Orleansville, consisted of 8 localities: Bouyamine - Cherchell - Genoa Fountain - Gouraya - Marceau (Menaceur) - Novi - Villbourg - Zurich (Sidi Amar).

It was formerly the official residence of the naval officer commanding, HM Dockyard, Trincomalee and later the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station of the Royal Navy until 1957 when British forces departed from Ceylon. History Navy House The British colonists seized the Port of Trincomalee from the Dutch in April 1795. This resulted in the British East Indian Fleet establishing their naval fortress in one of the most beautiful natural harbors in the world. The Chief of Customs of that time, Mr Lisigun, rented a 20-acre block of land near the harbour with a house perched on a small hill. It was to house the British Admiral and other high-ranking officers. Muslim carvings on door frames of the house, and 16th- century carvings of the crescent and star which was on a tall wall in the southern corner of the building, pave the way for speculation that the house was built by the Muslims from a village closer to the fort. The Dutch subsequently renovated the house converting it into a larger Dutch-style residence. Further refurbishment to the house concealed this artwork. The commander of the British East India Fleet, Vice Admiral William Drury, was the first person to reside in this house and the first admiral to occupy the home was Vice Admiral Samuel Hood in 1811. He was instrumental in converting the Trincomalee harbour into one of the major ports in the South East Asian Region. Having commanded the Navy for 13 months, he sent a letter to the Under Secretary of Colonial Estates in Britain, requesting that this House be completely taken over by the Royal Navy. It was only 29 years later his request was heeded and in 1840, and The Admirals House was secured by the Royal Navy for 1750 pounds. On 22 December 1811, Captain Robinson of the 19th Infantry Battalion became the owner of the house paying 1312 pounds, and he subsequently decided to sell the house for 2000 pounds. The house was valued and sold to the Royal Navy for 1750 pounds. Admiral Samuel Hood expanded the house into a large mansion, which he occupied it until his death. He loved Trincomalee harbour very much and in 1812, during his period, he built the dockyard and rebuilt the Admirals House almost changing everything except for the foundation. A naval artisan who built a verandah around the house named it the ‚ÄòStern Walk‚Äô. The living room facing the harbour is in the Western side and the main bedroom is in the middle of the house. It is believed that the Southern and Eastern parts of the Verandah had been built in the 19th century. In 1827, Rear Admiral John Hage, added a picturesque view to the house by planting coconut palms around the house. With the dying of coconut palms, 49 palm trees were brought from the Andaman Islands and planted by the daughter of Admiral Fisher and the wife of Admiral Fullerton. The Banyan tree which was planted during the same year had grown into a large tree by 1955. It expanded covering more than 300 yards. It is believed that this is the largest banyan tree in Sri Lanka. The giant bell(gong) hanging at the entrance of the house was brought from the Vanquished Fortress in Burma in the 16th Century. Rear Admiral Charles Austin who died while he was serving here had donated this bell in 1850. John Austin, his brother was a famous writer in the 19th century. The security of the house was done by the British Rifle Regiment as Trincomalee lasted as a garrison fortress and 1857 on wards its security was carried out by the Ceylon Rifle Regiment. Since the turn of the 20th century it was kept under the supervision of a senior naval officer who was stationed in Colombo. In 1905 it was again opened for Rear Admiral Sir George Warrender who had a residence in Bombay. He took away furniture, kitchen appliances and some crockery etc. to the Navy House there. Rear Admiral Sir Edmond Slade who succeeded Rear Admiral Warrender brought back all the items that had been taken away to Bombay. In 1924 with the supply of material to develop and renovate the radio broadcasting stations in Matara and Trincomalee, colourful bulbs and fans were fixed. The house was closed up for a period of time and its reopening in 1924 saw the beginning of a new era for the Navy House for all the subsequent residents sought to maintain the house and its surroundings. Rear Admiral Herbert Richmond set the precedent by maintaining the place, clearing the area around the house and adorning the place with flowers. In 1932 the wife of Vice Admiral Fullerton gave a new look to the Navy House. Bougainvillea plants from the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens were planted in front of the tennis court. The next admiral also maintained the house thereby making the Navy House a symbol of beauty. In 1935 a water supply system was established in the house. In 1937 a breadfruit tree was planted and wild orchids were introduced in 1938 further enhancing the beauty of the house. Once the Naval Headquarters was relocated to Colombo, the officers were provided with accommodation near the Victoria Arcade Building in Colombo Fort. From then onwards officers no longer resided in the Navy House. Vice Admiral JF Somerville was the last officer to reside in there until it was again occupied in 1941. The dining hall was converted into an officers' mess, the sitting room into a big restaurant and the Bed Rooms into cabins. Hence the beauty of the house gradually diminished. This was further exacerbated with the bombing of Trincomalee Harbour by the Japanese on 5 April 1942. The officers who lived in the Dockyard were then sheltered in the Navy House which affected the quality and the value of the house. Taking into consideration the strategic location and the operational importance of Trincomalee Harbour in 1946, the Admiral‚Äôs office was relocated to Trincomalee. In the aftermath of the war the Navy House required extensive renovation and this was done by then Commander-in-Chief Sir Arthur F E Palsier. The billiard room was extended, the dining hall was converted into a food preparation room, and the dining hall in the middle of the house was changed into a reception hall to welcome guests, and extra bedrooms were converted into bathrooms. He furnished the House with artifacts from England. Most importantly he regained its lost glory. The beauty of the surrounding of the house was restored by Admiral Sir Henry Oliver in 1951 by introducing bush type plants, called Hibiscus. In 1952 Admiral William Slayter also did many changes to the house. Old wooden pillars were replaced by iron pillars, the ceiling was fixed with a ceiling board and the roof was fixed with concrete. In 1954, the wife of Admiral Charles Norris did some changes too by adding new electrical equipment and painting the building. The last admiral who resided in the Navy House, Admiral Hilary Biggs, built a duckpond near the garage. His tenure there was short and in 1957 he organized a dinner dance as he was quite reluctant to leave this place. On 15 October 1957, the Trincomalee Naval Dockyard was officially handed over to the Sri Lankan government by the Royal Navy and since then the property been a possession of the Sri Lanka Navy.English translation by Capt Akram Alavi SLN, of the Sinhala article titled \\"Nawika Medura\\" written by Lieutenant Commander (Retd) HCL Caldera SLN for \\"The Quartermaster\\" magazine in the year 2000 coinciding with the Sri Lanka Navy's Golden Jubilee.

Her transition began in late 2005 and lasted approximately a year, after which she took the stage name Brittany CoxXx. At the start of 2008, agent David Forest confirmed her return to adult film productions, her first performance being in Brittany's Transformation in collaboration with Barresi, who she trusted and respected after their earlier work together. CoxXx declared that she was \\"really looking forward to working again with Pleasure Productions and Paul Barresi,\\" adding that \\"[i]t's funny how things happen in life. Everything seems to come full circle.\\" The film Brittany's Transformation told the story of her transitioning and was well received. Barresi put together the financing for the film and chose to include older footage of Stonie to tell her transition story. Barresi described the film as unlike any transsexual movie made before. The film was nominated in the 2009 AVN Awards in the category of \\"Best Transsexual Release\\", while CoxXx herself was nominated in the \\"Transsexual Performer Of The Year\\" category. Speaking about Brittany's Transformation, CoxXx commented that \\"since this is my first movie as a woman ‚Äì in my new bod, which I totally love by the way ‚Äì it's a whole new experience onscreen for myself and for the viewers\\". She was partnered with Christian XXX in the final scene of the film. J. C. Adams, who has been writing about gay pornography since at least 1998, commented that CoxXx's transsexual performance \\"may actually be the first time a gay adult performer has undergone the switch and re-emerged as a MTF actor. (Others have donned drag, of course, but that's a different animal.)\\" Jason Sechrest claimed that CoxXx was the first to move from gay male to trans woman porn star, describing the movie as \\"groundbreaking\\", although adult trans-actress Stasha in fact did that already in the early 90s, gaining attention after previously having performed in gay porn under the names Angelo and Steven Moore before transitioning to Stasha. Lucas Entertainment performer Christina Cruz has since followed Brittany by also transitioning from the gay male market to the transsexual market. According to Gay Porn Times editor J. C. Adams, the report of CoxXx's transition was in the top ten most popular stories they covered in 2008. Chi Chi LaRue commented on the difficulties CoxXx faced, observing that \\"she was happier once she transitioned\\" but also that many \\"people didn't show her support or respect her decision.\\" Post- acting and death  CoxXx left the adult industry in 2009 and moved to Florida, where she spent several months in hospital battling Hepatitis B and liver disease. By January 2010, her hepatitis was reported to be almost undetectable and she was recovering well. By September, CoxXx was reported as fully recovered and made a live appearance at Micky's in West Hollywood, California, stealing the show. CoxXx subsequently started a business in Fort Lauderdale, Florida - Couture Visions Photography - which she owned and operated until her death. CoxXx died at Broward Health in Fort Lauderdale on December 6, 2016 at the age of 38. She was survived by her father, two of her brothers, and her paternal grandmother. CoxXx was remembered fondly by adult industry figures. Chi Chi Larue described CoxXx as a \\"true original\\" who was \\"very beautiful in both of his and her lives\\" and \\"grabbed the bull by the horns and did it his way. She will definitely be missed. Rest in peace sweet angel.\\" The JRL Charts President reflected on McKay introducing him to Stonie, who he described as an \\"upbeat young man [sic] who had high hopes for a career in the gay adult film industry [who] became a true friend for many years. ...

It took place at the small settlement of El Herri, near Kh√©nifra in the French protectorate in Morocco. The battle was part of the Zaian War, in which the confederation of tribes sought to oppose continued French expansion into the interior of Morocco. Having captured the strategic town of Kh√©nifra earlier in the year, the French, under General Hubert Lyautey, entered negotiations with Mouha ou Hammou Zayani, who led the Zaian. Lyautey thought that peace could be achieved and ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Ren√© Laverdure, who commanded the garrison in Kh√©nifra, not to launch any offensives. Laverdure became frustrated with the lack of action and, on 13 November, led almost his entire garrison in an attack on the Zaian encampment at El Herri. The attack initially went well, with his artillery and cavalry clearing the tribesmen from the camp, looting the Zaian tents and capturing two of Hammou's wives. However, the French encountered a significant Zaian force during its withdrawal to Kh√©nifra. This force engaged the French with harassing fire, forcing them to move only under the cover of their artillery. Laverdure then ordered his wounded back to Kh√©nifra with a guard of a company of infantry, which were joined by large numbers of other troops who broke ranks to join the column. Whilst making a river crossing, Laverdure's rear guard and artillery were overrun and annihilated. Laverdure's remaining troops then formed square and fought a desperate last stand against several thousand tribesmen before they were also overrun and killed. The French losses were significant: some 623 North African, Senegalese and French soldiers (including Laverdure) were killed and 176 wounded. The Zaian lost around 182 men killed. The column of wounded reached Kh√©nifra just ahead of pursuing Zaian forces and the town came under siege. Lyautey was dismayed at Laverdure's actions and was briefly of the opinion that he had cost him the war. However, a relief force reached Kh√©nifra within a few days and the situation stabilised. The Zaian War lasted until 1921 when negotiations secured the submission of much of the confederation to French rule and a military offensive pushed the remainder into the High Atlas mountains. Background France's protectorate of Morocco was established after French intervention in the Agadir Crisis of 1911.. Resident General Louis-Hubert Lyautey served as the head of government and one of his main aims was to secure the \\"Taza corridor\\" in the Middle Atlas mountains linking Tunis to the Moroccan Atlantic coast.. He was opposed by the Berber tribes in the area, amongst them the Zaian confederation led by Mouha ou Hammou Zayani.. Hammou had opposed the French intervention since 1877 and led between 4,000 and 4,200 tents (the tribal unit of measurement) of people.. French attempts to persuade Hammou to submit had failed and in May 1914 Lyautey authorised General Paul Prosper Henrys to take command of all French troops in the area and launch an attack on Taza and Kh√©nifra, vital parts of the corridor... Despite some fierce engagements with the Zaian in the Kh√©nifra area, Henrys secured the two towns by the middle of June and inflicted substantial losses on the tribes.. As part of the defence of the area, Henrys established three Groupes Mobile, mobile columns of troops who could react quickly to threats. A Groupe Mobile was established at Kh√©nifra under Lieutenant-Colonel Ren√© Laverdure, another to the west under Lieutenant-Colonel Henri Claudel and a third to the east under Colonel No√´l Garnier-Duplessix.. July saw increasing attacks on Laverdure's command and the outbreak of the First World War which significantly reduced the number of French forces based in Morocco.. Lyautey was determined to hold Kh√©nifra to use as a bridgehead for further expansion of French territory and referred to it as a bastion against the \\"hostile Berber masses\\" upon which the \\"maintenance of [his] occupation\\" depended. The Oum er Rbia at Kh√©nifra Successfully repulsing additional attacks on Kh√©nifra, Henrys thought he had the upper hand, having proven that the reduced French forces could resist the tribesmen.. The Zaian were now contained within a triangle formed by the Oum er Rbia, the Serrou river and the Atlas mountains and were already in dispute with neighbouring tribes over the best wintering land. Battle Laverdure's attack Laverdure had been in Kh√©nifra for five months when Hammou set up camp at El Herri, a small village away, for the winter. Hammou had been promised peace talks and had just lost control over five tribes who began negotiations for submission to French rule. Henrys believed that Zaian resistance was near its end and that the war would soon be over. Lyautey wished to keep the situation calm and twice refused Laverdure permission to attack the camp at El Herri, for fear that it would affect the peace talks and that Laverdure had insufficient forces available for the assault.. He was instead ordered to keep to the French bank of the Oum er Rbia and had permission only to send troops out for convoy protection, wood gathering and road building. Senegalese Tirailleurs taking part in a bayonet charge in a drawing taken from a contemporary Russian magazine However Laverdure decided to disobey his orders to remain in Kh√©nifra and marched on El Herri with almost the entire garrison. He was said to be frustrated with the lack of action on the front and may have been persuaded by a Makhzen soldier eager to avenge a personal affront he had received from Hammou. Laverdure's column consisted of six infantry companies of Algerian and Senegalese Tirailleurs, a party of irregular Goumiers, two batteries of 65mm and 75mm (the famous Soixante-Quinze) cannon and a squadron of Spahi cavalry: numbering 43 officers and 1,187 men in total... This amounted to less than half the troops he had had in September when he was first denied permission to launch an attack.. Laverdure marched at 2.30 am on the morning of 13 November 1914 without informing his superiors, only leaving behind a note saying he was going to \\"annihilate\\" Hammou's camp. Laverdure's column reached El Herri at dawn and found the encampment of 100 tents. Most of the Zaian men were out of camp at the time, leaving behind the non-combatants, and Laverdure achieved complete surprise.. The first that many of the Zaian knew of the attack was when his artillery shells began exploding amongst the tents. This was followed up by a cavalry charge which cleared the camp but was halted by a group of tribesmen who had rallied on a hilltop to the south and inflicted \\"numerous losses\\" on the horsemen.. Laverdure had to send in his infantry to remove these Zaians, before looting the encampment. Hammou escaped in time but two of his wives were captured before the French headed back to Kh√©nifra at around 8.30 am, leaving the looting to tribesmen of the A√Øt Ichkern, formerly Hammou's allies, who assumed he was now beaten. Zaian counterattack The return to Kh√©nifra was initially hampered by attacks by small groups of tribesmen who were beaten off, but discovered the relatively small number of troops in the French column. Word was passed to others and soon a force, estimated at 5,000 by the French, was assembled. These men consisted of almost the entire Zaian tribe and elements of the Mrabtin, A√Øt Harkat, A√Øt Ischak and A√Øt Ichkern (the latter, seeing the French falling back, had changed allegiance once more).. Zaian tactics were to harass the flanks and rear of the column and to occupy any convenient high ground for sniping attacks.. The French found they could not move in safety without heavy covering fire from the artillery, which was reduced in effectiveness by the dispersed positions of the Zaian tribesmen and their use of cover. Hammou's nephew, Moha ou Akka, led a force of several thousand tribesmen around the French to cut off their route back to Kh√©nifra. At this point Laverdure ordered one company of his Senegalese infantry to leave the column to accompany a convoy of wounded soldiers to Kh√©nifra.. Many of his other troops, seeing the Senegalese leaving, broke ranks and followed in panic. Laverdure attempted to continue his withdrawal but, just having crossed the Chbouka river, his rearguard was surrounded and attacked repeatedly from all sides, being quickly overrun. The gun batteries soon suffered the same fate, their crews also being killed. The Zaian assembled on the ridges surrounding the remaining French troops, who had formed a defensive square, before launching a final attack with \\"several thousand\\" men. This attack lasted just a few minutes and, after a desperate struggle, the square was broken and the remainder of the column was wiped out. The Zaian chased down and killed any of the survivors who attempted to hide in the scrub. The wounded and their escort struggled into Kh√©nifra at about noon, narrowly outpacing the Zaian who had stopped to loot the bodies of the French dead. These men, numbering 171 men and five officers wounded and 426 men and five officers able bodied, were the only French survivors of the battle. A total of 623 French troops had died, along with around 182 of the Zaian. French losses amounted to 218 Algerian or Tunisian Tirailleurs, 210 French soldiers and 33 French officers, 125 Senegalese Tirailleurs and 37 Moroccan Goums killed. The French officers suffered the highest casualty rate of any group with 90% of them being killed or wounded (including Laverdure who died in the final attack); four of the five unwounded officers belonged to the cavalry.. Around 65% of the entire force had been killed or wounded and the French were forced to abandon 4 machine guns, 630 small arms, 62 horses, 56 mules, all of their artillery and camping equipment and much of their personal belongings.. Hammou took much of this with him when he escaped to the mountains of the Middle Atlas.. Aftermath A Soixante-Quinze similar to the four lost by the French at El Herri The disaster left Captain Pierre Kroll as the senior officer of the remnants of the Kh√©nifra garrison, some three companies of tirailleurs (one of which was an ad hoc unit made up from the partially equipped and shaken survivors of the battle). Having secured the defences he immediately telegraphed Lyautey and Henrys to inform them of events, the first they had heard of Laverdure's foray. Lyautey was briefly of the opinion that the event would cause the loss of the whole of Morocco. The next morning Zaian horsemen appeared on the hilltops to the south and east of the city. Kh√©nifra soon came under constant siege from the tribes. Henrys left Fez for Meknes from which he telegraphed Lyautey promising to \\"strike hard and fast\\" so that the \\"Laverdure disaster\\" did not threaten the French position in Morocco. He said that \\"everyone, everywhere must be aware of the fact that our forces are numerous, that strong columns are already on their way to Khenifra, and that the repression will be swift\\". Henrys dispatched Garnier-Duplessix's Groupe Mobile to Kh√©nifra from El Graar and ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph D√©rigoin to form another Groupe at Ito for mobile support. Garnier-Duplessix was forced to fight his way through groups of Zaian tribesmen and did not reach the town until 16 November. Henrys joined D√©rigoin and entered the town himself two days later, encountering no resistance on the way. Another part of the Kh√©nifra relief force was the 6th battalion of the 2nd French Foreign Legion who marched from Mrirt and saw action at El Hammam and along the Oum er Rbia.. By the end of the month, the French garrison had swelled to 7,000 troops, an all-time high. Henrys, Garnier-Duplessix and Kroll were all promoted shortly after the battle in recognition of their actions to prevent the loss of Kh√©nifra. As a show of force, Henrys led excursions from Kh√©nifra to El Herri on 19 and 20 November. He observed many campfires and some groups of tribesmen but on the whole the Zaian, who had moved their main camps away from the area, kept their distance. Henrys observed the field of battle and ordered the burial of the French dead, finding many stripped of their clothing and some mutilated or decapitated by post-mortem dagger wounds. Laverdure's body and those of six of his officers were missing, having been removed by Hammou for use as trophies but were later exchanged for Hammou's captured wives. The Zaian leader displayed these trophies and captured weapons to nearby tribes to encourage them to support him, a tactic that proved particularly successful with the tribes to the north. Although French forces subsequently fought several successful actions against the Zaian and recovered the captured weapons, El Herri showed that they could be beaten.. The battle, along with the siding of the Ottoman Empire with the Central Powers in the First World War and slow French progress on the Western Front, led to increasing numbers of recruits for Hammou.. Hammou's son, Hassan, surrendering to General Poeymireau The Zaian war continued for many years after El Herri with Henrys changing tactics from negotiation and bribery to \\"submit or starve\\".. Subsequent victories in the Middle Atlas restored the French image of superiority in force and led to increasing submissions and the withdrawal of the Zaian deeper into the mountains. By 1917, the French had managed to establish a military road straight through the Middle Atlas, limiting the free movement of the Zaian. The end of the war came through political rather than military means with Hammou's sons submitting, on his advice, to the French in June 1920.. Their submission persuaded 3,000 tents of Zaian to follow and within six weeks just 2,500 tents remained opposed to French rule.. Hammou was killed in Spring 1921 by a Berber war party led by Hassan and soon after a combined French and Berber attack on Bekrit defeated the last remaining Zaian force, ending the seven-year-long war.. After the war, French expansion in the area continued and they brought almost the entire Middle Atlas under their control by June 1922. Reasons for French defeat General Mangin whose opinions on the war Lyautey blamed for Laverdure's actions Though they held him in high regard, Lyautey and Henrys blamed Laverdure for the defeat, with the latter describing the Lieutenant-Colonel's march from Kh√©nifra as a \\"poorly prepared and poorly executed\\" \\"act of indiscipline\\". Laverdure was thought to have underestimated the ability of the Berbers to operate offensively in mountainous terrain against his column. His motive for the \\"inexcusable imprudence\\" of disobeying orders is thought to have been for personal glory and to bring the war to an early conclusion. One of the survivors of the battle, Jean Pichon, said that Laverdure was \\"haunted by the obsessive temptation\\" of defeating Hammou.. Lyautey stated, in a letter to Minister of War Alexandre Millerand, that Laverdure, had he not died on the field, would have deserved \\"the most severe punishment\\" at the hands of a military tribunal. It is thought that Laverdure's actions may have been influenced by a school of thought, advocated by General Charles Mangin, that bold movements would intimidate the North African tribes into submission.. This school of thought was critical of Lyautey's campaign of negotiation backed up by the threat of military power, arguing that it cost too many casualties and that a bolder commander should be appointed instead.. Mangin's opinions had many advocates among the French officers of the colonial forces in Morocco, keen to end the war quickly and transfer to the Western Front, were praised by newspapers, books and journal articles in France and had the support of part of the Chamber of Deputies. Lyautey believed that he had to constantly battle against this school of thought and could not hope to defeat the men who followed it as they were \\"self-satisfied with its infallibility and convinced of the pitiful inferiority of those who do not submit to it blindly\\". Legacy The battle was a shock to the French who had not expected the tribes to get the better of a well-armed column. Lyautey himself said that \\"in our entire colonial history there has never been a case of the destruction of such an important force, of the loss of [almost] all its officers ..., of the disappearance of so much materiel and booty of war\\". The battle has been described variously as the worst ever defeat of French forces in Morocco, the worst in North Africa and one of the worst in the French colonies. The heavy losses suffered at El Herri overshadowed the planning of French military policy for Morocco during the First World War. Today the battle is celebrated by the Moroccan press as a historic event in Moroccan history, alongside other instances of resistance against French and Spanish occupation.. An obelisk was erected near to the battlefield in 1991 and was unveiled by two Moroccan ministers, Moulay Ahmad Alawi and Muhammad El-Ansar, listing the names of the 182 Moroccan dead. Hammou is recorded on the obelisk as being a \\"proud champion\\" of \\"national resistance\\". The monument's Arabic text contains some mistakes, recording the French dead at 700 in number (Henrys recorded 623) and giving the year of the battle as 1912.

After working for six years in Serbia, Greece and eastern Europe, he was recently based for four years in Istanbul. His work in Turkey led to a series of photographs titled Fault Lines/Turkey/East/West, which has led to several exhibitions and a book. Georgiou has also taught photography at Barnet College in London and a number of workshops in Europe.\\"Double master-class by Vanessa Winship and George Georgiou: Documentary practice and narrative, the long term project\\" , International Summer School of Photography (ISSP), Ludza.

Arriving somewhere new, Georgiou's approach is first to unburden himself of preexisting images of the place and to try to see through superficial differences with places he knows; he then looks for commonalities and actual differences.Colin Pantall, \\"Parallel lines\\", British Journal of Photography, 7 January 2009, p.17. He starts by himself and only when well underway hopes to attract commissions and make sales.Pantall, \\"Parallel lines\\", p.21. Georgiou's early work was in black-and-white but for Fault Lines and subsequent work he moved to colour, using a compact camera with an articulated LCD that may be viewed from above, like the ground glass screen of a twin-lens reflex camera; this is because he believes it less intimidating for the people photographed than a camera held to the eye.Miranda Gavin, \\"George Georgiou: Fault Lines\\", HotShoe, June‚ÄìJuly 2010. Georgiou belongs to Panos Pictures. His noncommercial approach has presented challenges; speaking in 2009, he described himself as having large debts but remaining optimistic.Pantall, \\"Parallel lines\\", p.25. Turkey Georgiou had long been curious about Turkey, and when his visit to Istanbul in 2003 coincided with bombings he determined to learn more about the issues involved.Adam Stoltman, \\"George Georgiou in Modern Turkey\\", New York Times, 20 August 2010. The eventual theme to his work in Turkey gradually emerged as he observed bleak new collective housing springing up for an incongruous urbanisation of the rugged Anatolian plateau. The resulting work, Fault Lines/Turkey/East/West, explores the notion of an East/West division and the additional and complex fault lines ‚Äì religious/secular, tradition/modernity, and more ‚Äì that cross the Turkey of today. Georgiou started the work in monochrome but soon moved to colour. Photographing in spring and autumn helped in subduing the light and avoiding the blue skies familiar from National Geographic and the like. In a review of Georgiou's exhibition Fault Lines at Side Gallery (Newcastle), Katie Lin found that his photographs evoked sadness rather than sympathy resulting from \\"the desolation and emptiness that features in so many of his shots\\". In some cases, this desolation was exaggerated by the \\"disproportional space awarded to the sky\\" or by the look of the \\"faces of passersby who just happened to get caught in the frame\\". But overall she found the photographs were \\"thought-provoking and beautiful in content, composition and colour, a fantastic display of the everyday life experience of Turkish people\\".Katie Lin, \\"Review of George Georgiou‚Äôs exhibition Fault Lines at Side Gallery, Newcastle\\", HotShoe. Retrieved 12 December 2010. Adam Stoltman wrote for the New York Times that in Fault Lines: > Through a series of haunting architectural and landscape scenes of Turkey's > rush toward modernization ‚Äì and the resulting tension between the secular > and the modern ‚Äì George Georgiou has visually put his finger on a kind of > listless alienation which at times can seem to pervade globalized society. Georgia and the Ukraine In late 2010 Georgiou had been working for five years on In the Shadow of the Bear, a project that looks at the aftermath of the peaceful \\"Rose\\" and \\"orange\\" revolutions that took place in Georgia and the Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia's resurgence as a major international power and its continuous involvement in the two nations' affairs. The project looks at signs in the domestic and public spheres, that when taken together build up a representation of how the people of Georgia and the Ukraine negotiate the space that they find themselves in;\\"George Georgiou to speak at Vision 2010\\", \\"Latest news\\", Vision 10.

SS indicated that the vessel was a submarine, and the K suffix that it was a hunter-killer. The United States Navy does not currently operate any submarines of this type, and so the designation is inactive.  History  The start of the Cold War in the mid-1940s and the threat of Soviet submarines in the Atlantic led several Western navies to build or adapt submarines to specialize in hunting other submarines. The changes included streamlining to make them quieter and improved acoustic sensors. This type of vessel was given the classification SSK in United States service. The changes were eventually incorporated into all submarines, allowing the SSK role to be subsumed into the regular attack submarine role and the classification became obsolete. The only purpose-built ones were the three Barracuda-class:  * These were small submarines equipped with enhanced hydrophones and designed to lie in wait for Soviet submarines off the Russian coast. They were designed to be cheaply built for easy mass-production in the event of a war, and were all reclassified as SS or SST boats in 1959 when they were relegated to training duties. Seven World War II submarines were also given the SSK classification in the late 1940s following streamlining and sensor upgrades.

He was born in Strasbourg, France in 1749, and studied at the local Gymnasium from the age of nine. He was influenced by the master of the school Dr Lorenz . In 1766 he joined the University of Strasbourg and studied for nine years. He was ordained, and went as a missionary to southern India in 1776 at the recommendation of Dr Freylinghausen of Halle. His first appointment along with Johann Wilhelm Gerlach was at the Danish Lutheran Tranquebar Mission at Tranquebar; in 1806, he moved to an English mission in Madras, where he died in 1836. Continuing the work of earlier naturalists in the region including Johann Gerhard K√∂nig, Rottler became an enthusiastic botanist, who collected more than 2000 plant samples from southern India and sent them to Europe for study and research. Rottler also studied the Tamil language and compiled a dictionary. He married a Dutch lady, a widow of a Dutch ship captain, in 1779 and who died in Vepery in 1827 from cancer. He corresponded with Dr Schreber at the University of Erlangen and received a Doctor in Philosophy in 1795. In 1795 he accompanied Sir Hugh Cleghorn, secretary to Lord North. Cleghorn made use of Rottler's knowledge of botany and natural history. A trunk full of plant specimens was sent to the Great Herbarium of King's College London. In 1873, this collection was transferred to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. In 1803, Rottler was put in charge of the Vepery mission to replace Paezold who had moved to teach Tamil at the Fort William College. His findings were published in Europe in 1803, but went largely overlooked for many years. Most of Rottler's botanical collections are in the Royal Herbarium of Munich. Many of his plants were described by Carl Ludwig Willdenow, Martin Vahl and others. The genus Rottlera was named after him by Vahl but is now a synonym of Mallotus. A memorial tablet to Rottler is in the Vepery church.

The mosque was originally built in 1438 and later rebuilt in 1833 by Abdurrahman Pasha.Xhamia e Pashes History T√ºrbe near the Colored Mosque The ≈†arena D≈æamija was originally built in 1438.Pg 106 - The architect behind the ≈†arena D≈æamija was Isak Bey. Most mosques of the time had sultans, beys or pashas financing their constructions, but the ≈†arena D≈æamija, however, was financed by two sisters from Tetovo.Enduring Time ¬´ Notes from Near and Far As with many mosques, a hammam was built nearby across the river. The site used to include an Inn as well as a bathhouse on the other side of the river. The current courtyard of the ≈†arena D≈æamija is filled with many flowers, a fountain, and a T√ºrbe. The octagonal \\"t√ºrbe\\" houses the resting places of Hurshida and Mensure, the two sisters who financed the construction of the mosque in 1438. Abdurrahman Pasha, a great enthusiast of art who was fond of Tetovo, reconstructed the ≈†arena D≈æamija in 1833. In 1991, the Islamic Community in Tetovo built walls around the mosque in the typical classical Ottoman style. In 2010, a renovation of the exterior paintings was completed and, with a ‚Ç¨94,700 grant from the United States State Department, the fa√ßade was reconstructed and preserved in 2011. Architecture Medresa with-in the complex of the decorated mosque Unlike the traditional Ottoman ceramic tile decorations in mosques, the ≈†arena D≈æamija has bright floral paintings.Lonely Planet Western Balkans - Google Books More than 30,000 eggs were used to prepare the paint and glaze that went into the elaborate decorations. Another major difference between the ≈†arena D≈æamija and other Ottoman mosques is that the ≈†arena D≈æamija does not have a distinctive exterior dome,Balkanology :: Macedonia :: Skopje and Surroundings as the architecture of the mosques styles the early Constantinople Ottoman Architecture. The distinguishing feature of the mosque is its painted decorations. Abdurrahman Pasha commissioned, for this purpose, masters from Debar who painted the ornamentation with oil paints. In addition to the geometric and floral ornamentation, landscape is also encountered. Among the pictorial decorations, especially attractive is the depiction of Mecca, a rare and perhaps the only example of the illustration of the shrine of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, in southeast Europe.

The traditions exist since 1735, when the institution was founded and named to Bergschola. The school had students from all over Europe and the Habsburg Empire. When education started, the newcomers did not have an opportunity to have an accommodation or a medical treatment, therefore they were supported by the older ones. But the newcomers had to undergo several probes and also an ‚Äôexam‚Äô to be in favour with older students. The traditions helped to create a solidarity and a communion between them. The traditions are also originated in the system of guilds back to the 12th and 14th century. Nowadays, the spirit of the traditions are kept alive by students of Hungarian universities such as those in Miskolc, Sopron, Duna√∫jv√°ros and Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. The main components of the tradition are the various uniforms, special evenings, songs and the Salamander by graduating students. Uniforms The ancestor of all uniforms were the miners‚Äô uniform. The function of it was to protect the miners at work. However, the uniforms are now different according to the several professions and faculties: Gruben Uniform of the miners and the metal workers. It is black with a velvet. Auf or aufhauer Uniform of the metal workers, mechanics, organisers and teachers of technical subjects. It is coloured black or blue with a colorful velvet. Walden Wore by the foresters, woodcutters and geodesists. It is fawn-coloured with a green, black or blue velvet. There are other uniforms, which firstly appeared in the year 2000 at the University of Miskolc. These are: Juratus for the jurists Individual economist costume for the economists Bocskai and Kazinczy individual costumes(in Hungarian: egyenviseletek) for arts students Stefania for the medical faculty Besides, the uniforms can have patches or accessories such as a long stem called ‚Äôfokos‚Äô (Hungarian). Today, these function only as ornaments. Special evenings and songs Originally, the special evenings, (in Hungarian: szakestek) were organised to discuss the features of professional issues. Nowadays, these issues gave way to civilised fun. There are still several remarks made by students on these evenings about professional issues, but these were made in a rather funnier way. Only the ‚Äôbaptised‚Äô and invited students can participate in the special evenings. The students usually sing songs together during the event and there are so-called office-holders with names of Latin-German origin. Some of them are wearing a ribbon and they are holding particular duties during the evening. Salamander It is the farewell ceremony since 1830 by the university leavers who keep the spirit of the school traditions. In the course of it, the graduating students participate in a procession which traditionally takes place through the city centre and they are holding torches and lamps while they are singing songs which are originated from Selmec.

Its segments were originally aired between shows on Noggin from 2003 until 2009 and on Nick Jr. from 2009 to 2012. The title characters are a yellow moose teacher named Moose A. Moose and his blue bird friend, Zee D. Bird. They acted as the on-air hosts of the channels. In 2015, the segments were repurposed for the Noggin app, packaged as a series. The show premiered on April 7, 2003. Plot A yellow moose teacher named Moose and his bird friend Zee introduce preschoolers to concepts such as math, reading and colors. Before he is introduced, he is most likely a friend of Noggin's former host, Feetface, whom gives request for Moose as host while announcing Feetface's departure from the network. Characters *Moose A. Moose ‚Äì A yellow-colored anthropomorphic and a very friendly moose who teaches lessons to viewers through questioning. He encourages curiosity and is very knowledgeable. He is voiced by Paul Christie. *Zee D. Bird ‚Äì A small silent blue bird who communicates through blinking, flapping her wings and staring. She acts as Moose's sidekick and assists viewers in figuring out answers to questions. Episodes Over 100 shorts were produced over the series' nine-year run. 46 of these shorts have been released as part of the Noggin subscription service as of November 11, 2015. Recurring segments *Mighty Fine Art ‚Äì Moose and Zee discuss a painting or artist at the art museum. *Puzzle Time ‚Äì Moose asks the viewer to solve a puzzle by finding shapes, matching two images or spotting the difference in a group of pictures. *Music Video ‚Äì Moose sings about a season, holiday or concept. *In Other Words ‚Äì A specific word is introduced and explained to the viewer. *Class Pet Time ‚Äì The life of an animated, hamster-like pet named \\"Chip-Chip\\" is presented. The shorts are narrated by Moose, with children's voices commenting on Chip-Chip's actions. *Story Time ‚Äì A well-known story is read aloud, occasionally by Moose himself. *Little Green Fingers ‚Äì A live- action segment featuring a type of plant. These shorts were only aired on Nick Jr. UK (until being added to the Noggin app under the title \\"Zee's Garden\\"). *Zee's Bookshelf ‚Äì Zee introduces an upcoming television program. Ebb and Flo was aired exclusively between these segments. Broadcast Several weeks before the series' first airing, advertisements featuring Moose A. Moose and Feetface were broadcast on Noggin to notify viewers of upcoming schedule changes. The series premiered on April 7, 2003, as part of the Noggin channel redesign. Three other programs premiered alongside Moose and Zee: Tweenies, Miffy and Friends, and the first full-length episode of Oobi (Oobi shorts had aired since 2000). Moose and Zee would continue to air daily on Noggin through the channel's rebranding as Nick Jr. on September 28, 2009, and would air its last episode on February 29, 2012. The series is not currently airing on television, but is available for viewing as part of Viacom's Noggin streaming app released in March 2015. The original 2015 commercial for the Noggin app depicts a child viewing Moose and Zee episodes, marking the first time since 2012 that the characters have been seen on television. From 2008 until 2012, Moose and Zee shorts were added monthly to the \\"Preschool\\" folder included as part of the Nickelodeon On Demand service. During that time, all \\"Nick Jr. On Demand\\" promo videos featured Moose A. Moose. The series was dubbed into Spanish in late 2015, with the dubbed episodes included as part of the Latin American Noggin application. Select episodes were aired on Nick Jr. Latin America at the time of the app's release. In other media Online The series' title characters were prominently featured on Noggin.com (and NickJr.com, to a lesser extent) from 2003 onward. About one hundred online printables and crafts were created to coincide with new shorts. Recipes such as character cakes and meals inspired by the shorts were accessible through the websites for several years. Many digital games based on the series were made available, such as \\"Doodle Pad,\\" \\"What's the Word, Bird?\\" and \\"What's Different\\". Video clips from Moose and Zee episodes included as part of the \\"Nick Jr. Video\\" service were live on NickJr.com until early 2012. The Moose and Zee characters were also the focal point of two (now defunct) online learning programs. The first was titled \\"MyNoggin\\" and was available at www.mynoggin.com in 2008 through 2009. MyNoggin subscriptions were available for online purchase, as well as through several prepaid game cards sold at most major retailers. The service was also advertised in many issues of the Parents' Choice Award-winning children's publication Nick Jr. Magazine. After the Noggin network was rebranded as Nick Jr. in late 2009, MyNoggin was replaced by \\"Nick Jr. Boost.\\" Nick Jr. Boost was very similar to MyNoggin and continued to use Moose A. Moose as its mascot until its close in 2013. The Boost program was a premium subscription service like its predecessor, with paid membership (stickers valid for a free month of Boost were attached to early releases of Nickelodeon's \\"The First Day of School\\" DVD). In early 2010, a mobile application based on the show titled \\"A to Z with Moose and Zee\\" was made available for purchase in the iOS App Store worldwide. The game, aimed at preschoolers, was designed to teach children the letters of the alphabet. The app was compatible with updated iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices at the time and was sold for $1.99 in U.S. dollars. It has since been removed from the App Store. As part of the revival of the Noggin brand as an app in 2015, Moose and Zee were reintroduced.Noggin.com as of January 30, 2017 Live shows In late 2009, Nickelodeon partnered with Key Brand Entertainment to produce \\"Storytime Live!\\", a theatrical performance featuring Nick Jr. characters. Moose and Zee was one of the several Nick Jr. programs showcased as part of the production, with a full-size Moose costume and Zee puppet created by Geppetto Studios. Nickelodeon created a different mascot-style costume of Moose A. Moose for \\"meet-and-greet\\" event appearances, taking place at locations such as the Nebraskan \\"Kidz Explore\\" festival. The meet-and-greet costume design differed greatly from the older Storytime Live! version, with the Moose costume being much larger and more similar to his square shape as seen in the show. Merchandise In November 2005, Noggin released products such as clothing, notebooks, holiday ornaments and greeting cards featuring the Moose and Zee logo and its characters. These products were available through the Noggin.com online store. In 2010, Moose and Zee plush dolls, figures, shirts and \\"crazy straws\\" featuring the characters were sold at Nickelodeon's Storytime Live! performance and at Nickelodeon Universe. Several of these items are currently available at Nickelodeon Universe's online store. A series of short stories and paper activities based on Moose and Zee titled \\"Learn with Moose and Zee!\\" was produced in 2011. The individual stories and activities were included at the ends of many Dora the Explorer books released that year, such as \\"Dora Saves the Enchanted Forest,\\" \\"Dora and Diego Help the Little Wolf,\\" and a reissuing of \\"At the Carnival.\\" No full-length Moose and Zee books were released. Although the series was never given a DVD release of its own, Moose and Zee shorts were attached to several Nick Jr. DVDs. These include the 2010 DVD Let's Hear It For the Laurie Berkner Band! (which includes the shorts \\"Everywhere I Go,\\" \\"Music Makes Me,\\" \\"We're Goin' on a Trip,\\" and \\"Word of Wonder\\") and the Dora the Explorer DVD Explore the Earth! (which includes the shorts \\"I'm In Neighborhood\\" and \\"Explore the Seashore\\"). In addition to physical DVD releases, some episodes of the series are available for digital download on the US iTunes Store. The episode \\"I Don't Like Candy Corn\\" is available as part of the collection Nick Jr. Haunted Halloween, Vol. 3 and the episode \\"Winter Wonderland\\" is available as part of Nick Jr. Wintertime Adventures. Several products given to attendees of \\"Club Noggin\\" (an interactive hour-long program taking place at General Growth Property malls across the United States) featured Moose and Zee. These products included posters, cut-out crafts and \\"badges\\" made of fabric. Club Noggin distributed them from 2004 until 2006. The Moose and Zee characters are the \\"hosts\\" of a Nintendo-produced game for the Wii console, \\"Nickelodeon Fit.\\" Players cannot play as Moose or Zee.

Carra Saint-Cyr entered active service in 1774, with the Bourdonnais regiment, and was a part of the French expeditionary corps during the American War of Independence. He was a captain and held a position in the military commissariat. With the outbreak of the Wars of the Revolution, Carra Saint-Cyr resumed active duty, serving in the army of the West as aide-de-camp to general Jean-Baptiste Annibal Aubert du Bayet, subsequently accompanying Aubert du Bayet to Constantinople, where the latter was appointed ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Carra Saint-Cyr then served as consul in Wallachia, before returning to France, in 1798. He was at Marengo in 1800 and became a general of division in 1803. Named governor of Magdeburg in 1806, he was created baron of the Empire two years later and in 1809 he held the command of an infantry division during the War of the Fifth Coalition, playing an important role at the battle of Aspern-Essling. He was named governor of Dresden and in 1813 governor of Hamburg and in this capacity evacuated the city with his troops and was defeated on the Elbe. For this, he was disgraced, but general Dominique Vandamme still gave him the command of a division, with the mission of defending the Ems river. With the Bourbon Restoration of 1814, Carra Saint-Cyr was created count and named governor of the French Guiana, a position that he would hold from 1814 to 1819. His name appears on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Dec. 2010 MacConnel received his BA, with honors, from the University of California, San Diego in 1969 and his MFA, also with honors, in 1972.  Career  MacConnel had a lot of trouble starting out as an artist due to the fact that he had to come up against the minimalism of the time in the 1970s. During the Minimalist movement, artists weren't interested in color or even painting for the most part; MacConnel's art just wasn't accepted as serious. It also had partly to do with his material, instead of painting on stretched canvas, MacConnel instead painted on fabric and bed sheets, which he would tear apart and sew back together again. It wasn't until MacConnel was in an exhibition in (Germany) that his art became recognized. :\\"It wasn't really until a German collector who wrote a newsletter for German collectors saw the work in a show that I was in Germany and was overcome by it. He thought it was really brilliant for some reason. And that's when a contingent of Europeans really started looking at what we were trying to do. Particularly in my case, what I was trying to do. And found that it resonated in that area for them as a new avenue into the future, really, of what art making might be. So it was revolutionary in some ways in terms of, like, the status quo\\".

A book, Collection Applied Design, which he had found in China Town a few years before, inspired the exhibition. This book was pages of clip art and logos put together randomly, in no certain order, and without an index, which inspired his series of works, \\"10 Items or Less\\" which he put into the show. * Age of Plastic was his next big exhibition which he added more of the sculpture aspect of his work. He had been collecting beach items that had washed up on shore for two decades and finally decided how he wanted to utilize them. He used them into a series of works titled \\"Trashy Beach Clowns\\" where he used his found objects and transformed them into clown figures. * Another well recognized series of works that is more recent is \\"Woman with Mirror\\" in 2007. In this series he went back to his original medium of painting with acrylics.

Parma Calcio 1913 covers nearly 100 years of the football from the club based in Parma, Italy. Established in 1913 the club would eventually go on to win titles on the national and international stage. The club is most famous for the period in which it collected all of its eight major titles, between 1992 and 2002. The club was declared bankrupt in 2015. Early years (1913‚Äì1940) A football club was founded in Parma in July 1913 as Verdi Foot Ball Club in honour of famous opera composer Giuseppe Verdi, who was born in the province of Parma, adopting its unique white shirts emblazoned with a black cross on the front. The genesis came about after Verdi's death was commemorated with the dispute of the Coppa Verdi; the players who competed formed the basis of the first team of Parma Football Club, formed in December of the same year. Parma began playing league football during the 1919‚Äì20 season, finishing second in Emilian Championship qualifying. In 1922, the president at the time, Ennio Tardini, launched his plans to build a stadium for the club, as Parma initially had no permanent home, having previously used the Piazza d'Armi for two spells, land on the outskirts of the south-east of Parma and the Tre Pioppi. The Stadio Ennio Tardini would be named in the Italian lawyer's honour after he died before the stadium was opened the following year. Parma were participating in the Emilian regional championship at this point, from which they would qualify to play nationally by performing well. They achieved their first promotion from a regional league during the 1924‚Äì25 season, moving from the Seconda Divisione to the Prima Divisione, before becoming founding members of Serie B after finishing runners-up in the Prima Divisione in the 1928‚Äì29 season. Parma made their debut in Serie B on 6 October 1929, beating Biellese 2‚Äì0. The team remained in Serie B for three years before being relegated to the Prima Divisione at the end of the 1931‚Äì32 season, the year before the club changed its name to Associazione Sportiva Parma. Having finished in the top two positions for three consecutive seasons in the Prima Divisione, Parma were accepted into the renamed third tier of Italian football for the 1935‚Äì36 season, Serie C, where they competed for the rest of the decade, achieving a best finish of fourth in 1939‚Äì40. Life as a provincial club (1940‚Äì1968) A graphical representation of the attendances at the Tardini since 1986. The red line represents the season high, the blue line the season average and the green line the season low. After finishing as runners-up in 1941‚Äì42, Parma very nearly achieved a return to Serie B the next year, winning seventeen matches of nineteen and scoring 82 goals to top their group, before progressing to the final, where they would have won promotion but for their disqualification due to alleged corruption on the final day of the season in their match against Lecco. Italian football was then brought to a halt as World War II intensified, although Parma did make an appearance in the Campianto Alta Italia in 1944. Following the restart of organised football, Parma enjoyed three years in Serie B, then split into two regional divisions, before again being relegated in 1948‚Äì49 to Serie C after losing their relegation play‚Äìoff by four goals to one against Spezia in Milan. Il Crociato then spent another five seasons in Serie C, where they finished second place on two occasions before gaining promotion once again in 1953‚Äì54 with the help of the prolific Czechoslovakian left-winger J√∫lius Korostelev, who scored 15 of the side's 45 goals. While Korostelev headed the scoring charts that year, William Bronzoni was more consistent and remains the club's record league goalscorer to this day, having netted 78 times from 1945 to 1953 Following this promotion, one of the most successful periods in the club's history began, as the team would spend eleven consecutive years in the second tier and consistently finish mid-table; they would end up as high as ninth position in 1954‚Äì55, which represented a record for the club at that time. The stars of this era were Paolo Erba, who was named the capocannoniere, the league's top scorer, in 1956‚Äì57, and Ivo Cocconi, who set the club's appearance record, playing 308 times. Parma also made their debut on the European stage during the 1960‚Äì61 season, defeating Swiss side AC Bellinzona in the Coppa delle Alpi. The club's form dropped, however, and they were once again relegated to Serie C in the 1964‚Äì65 season, finishing last with just 23 points. Parma spent just one season in Serie C before they were relegated for a second successive season and found themselves in Serie D in 1966. The club was in turmoil and, having been ordered into liquidation by the Court of Parma in 1968, it was the absorption of local side A.C. Parmense that brought about a change of fortunes in both financial and sporting terms and led to a change of name to Associazione Calcio Parma. Dipping into and out of lower league obscurity (1968‚Äì1985) Parma topped their regional division in 1969‚Äì70, earning themselves promotion to Serie C, where they would remain for three years. In 1969, the club signed winger Bruno Mora, who was capped 21 times for Italy, went to the 1962 World Cup, won Serie A twice and the European Cup once and was the first person from Parma to play for the national team when he made his debut in 1959. He had previously turned the opportunity to play for Parma down due to its relatively small size, but he ended his career at the club in 1971 after a two-year stint wearing the cross. He would later manage the club for a short period in the early 1980s before his death in 1986. The club crept back into professional football with promotion to Serie B during the 1972‚Äì73 season after a 2‚Äì0 play-off victory over Udinese in Vicenza, but would spend just two seasons in the league, although they did manage to finish as high as 5th in 1973‚Äì74, setting a new club record in the process. Relegation the following year saw the club return to Serie C, where they would stay until their promotion under Cesare Maldini in 1978‚Äì79. Maldini-led Parma beat Triestina 3‚Äì1 after extra time in a play-off match, thanks to two goals from a young Carlo Ancelotti, who moved to Roma that summer after his starring role. However, they only lasted a season in Serie B and began the 1980s back down in Serie C. In 1982‚Äì83, Massimo Barbuti arrived at Parma, a player who is still referred today as l'idolo della Nord, or the idol of the North. He was so called for his popularity amongst those sitting in the Curva Nord, where Parma's staunchest fans have historically sat during home matches at the Tardini. Parma returned to Serie B as champions after winning their division in 1984 with 18 goals from Barbuti and final day victory over San Remo with Juventus-bound Stefano Poli scoring the only goal of the game. Il Ducali's stay in Serie B was shorter than hoped as they spent just one season in the league, finishing third from bottom and being relegated as a result. The disappointment led to the departure of cult hero Barbuti, a striker who scored 37 league goals in 98 appearances in just three years for the club and was loved by the fans for his tireless running, goalscoring record and manic celebrations in front of ‚Äì and sometimes in ‚Äî the Curva Nord at the Stadio Ennio Tardini. Two promotions (1985‚Äì1990) Parma continued to yo-yo between the leagues and returned to Serie B under Arrigo Sacchi in 1986 after finishing level on points at the top of the league with Modena, having never previously seriously threatened to do so. Promotion was secured on the final day of the season with a 2‚Äì0 victory over Sanremese, a day on which Alessandro Melli, a player who would go on to play an important role in some of Parma's most famous triumphs and enjoy considerable success at the club in the process of doing so, scored his first goal for the Gialloblu. Parma's first season back in Serie B was a successful one, missing out on promotion to Italy's top tier by just three points and eliminating A.C. Milan from the Coppa Italia, a result that convinced their owner, Silvio Berlusconi, to hire Sacchi as the new manager of the Rossoneri. His replacement, Zdenƒõk Zeman, was fired after just seven matches and replaced by Giampieri Vitali, who secured two mid-table finishes before being replaced in 1989 by Nevio Scala, who would introduce a 5‚Äì3‚Äì2 formation that would be the basis for much of the club's success during his reign. Scala's Parma led Serie B at the half-way mark and, despite the distress of a stadium disaster in a home match against Reggina in January and the death of owner Ernesto Ceresin in February seeing the Ducali fall to eighth, a late run of form and victory on the final day against old Derby del Grana rivals Reggiana with goals from fan favourite and right winger Marco Osio and forward Alessandro Melli meant Parma secured a historic promotion to Serie A on 27 May 1990. After Parma's promotion, Calisto Tanzi increased his stake in the ownership of the club to 45% with the purchase of the deceased Ceresin's sons' shares and named Giorgio Pedraneschi as president. This would allow Scala to supplement the squad that achieved promotion from Serie B, which included central defenders Luigi Apolloni and Lorenzo Minotti ‚Äì Minotti also went on to captain the side ‚Äì and star striker Alessandro Melli, with players such as Tomas Brolin, Claudio Taffarel and Georges Grun. Serie A and Scala's success (1990‚Äì1994) The patch worn over Parma's badge in the seasons following their three Coppa Italia triumphs Parma's first ever game in Serie A was a 2‚Äì1 defeat at home to Turin giants Juventus, which was followed by an inaugural Serie A victory 15 days later: 1‚Äì0 victory over Diego Maradona's Napoli. Parma ended their first ever season in Serie A in sixth place, which meant they qualified for the UEFA Cup. However, the 1991‚Äì92 season saw Parma exit the UEFA Cup to CSKA Sofia in the first round despite the notable additions of Antonio Benarrivo and Alberto Di Chiara, each of whom were full- backs that would go on to appear for Italy. The club had more success on the domestic front, where they finished sixth in the league ‚Äì lack of a prolific scorer costing Parma the chance to fight Torino for third ‚Äì and prevailed in the Coppa Italia final against Juventus. Losing the away leg 1‚Äì0, Parma managed to secure their first ever major trophy when they won the home leg 2‚Äì0 with a goal from Alessandro Melli on the stroke of half-time before Marco Osio struck on the hour mark. In 1991, Parmalat acquired the football club outright. Parma's squad was further improved by the summer arrival of Colombian striker Faustino Asprilla and they managed a first major international trophy in 1993 when an early volley from captain Lorenzo Minotti from a corner, an Alessandro Melli header and a late Stefano Cuoghi strike helped Parma to a 3‚Äì1 victory in the Cup Winners' Cup over Belgian side Royal Antwerp at Wembley Stadium in England on 12 May 1993. They also managed a record high finish of third place, but slipped to defeat in the 1992 Supercoppa Italiana against A.C. Milan. The following season, the club were successful in the European Super Cup; winning an all Italian final against AC Milan. Having lost the first leg at home by a single goal to nil, victory was nonetheless secured after goals from new players Nestor Sensini and Massimo Crippa. The same season, however, they lost the Cup Winners' Cup 1‚Äì0 in the final against Arsenal and slipped to 5th in the league due to a leaky defence, despite new signing Gianfranco Zola scoring eighteen league goals as part of Parma's three-pronged forward line, alongside Brolin and Asprilla. More international fame (1994‚Äì1998) The next year, bolstered by the acquisitions of Fernando Couto and Dino Baggio, Parma would face Juventus in a two-legged final, as they did in the 1992 domestic cup final, only this time the prize at stake was greater: the UEFA Cup. Dino Baggio scored the only goal of the first leg ‚Äì played in Parma ‚Äì with a far post header from close range and he scored again with a neat lob over Angelo Peruzzi in reply to Gianluca Vialli's strike in the second leg, which was staged in Milan, to give Parma a 2‚Äì1 aggregate win and a second major European trophy. Parma lost the Coppa Italia final, which pitted the same sides against each other over two legs, 2‚Äì1. Despite the signings of Hristo Stoichkov and Filippo Inzaghi and the encouraging form of young goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, a trophy-less 1995-96 followed and after seven years that yielded four major trophies, Nevio Scala, also Parma's longest-serving manager of all time, stepped down as manager. Carlo Ancelotti replaced him. The man presiding over the club's affairs during this period, president Pedraneschi, was also replaced by Stefano Tanzi, son of president Calisto. Stadio Ennio Tardini, Parma's home stadium Ancelotti and Tanzi immediately overhauled the team that summer, signing Hern√°n Crespo, Enrico Chiesa and Z√© Maria and selling Stoichkov, Couto, Inzaghi and Di Chiara. As the new leadership continued to make changes to the team, Zola, who had scored 49 goals in 102 league games for Parma, was sold to Chelsea for ¬£4.5M in November 1996 as he was incompatible with the formation switch from 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 to 3‚Äì5‚Äì2, a decision Ancelotti has since expressed his regret over. However, the side packed full of stars were guided to the club's best ever league finish under Ancelotti in 1997: second place and only two points behind champions Juventus, who converted a dubiously awarded penalty against Parma in a 1‚Äì1 draw in May. As a result, Parma made their first appearance in the Champions League, but having beaten Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to qualify for the group stages, further qualification and a quarter-final was in part denied by a Borussia Dortmund side led by Nevio Scala. This, coupled with a disappointing finish in fifth position in Serie A led to the sacking of Ancelotti and the appointment of Alberto Malesani. A positive was the emergence of young talents Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram, all of whom would later win World Cups for their countries. Further domestic and international success (1998‚Äì2001) A ticket to the 1999 UEFA Cup Final against Marseille, held in Moscow, Russia Malesani's first business was the completion of the transfer of Juan Sebasti√°n Ver√≥n from Sampdoria. Despite a disappointing finish in fourth place in Serie A, this season remains Parma's most successful ever, winning two cup competitions as Parma adopted yellow and blue horizontal stripes for the first time in many years. On 14 April 1999, Parma and Fiorentina played out a 1‚Äì1 draw in the first leg of the Coppa Italia final with Crespo opening the scoring before compatriot Gabriel Batistuta equalised late on. Crespo scored twice in the second leg, played on 5 May in Florence, which ended 2‚Äì2, meaning Parma won on the away goals rule, lifting their second Coppa Italia. Just three days earlier, Parma had won their second UEFA Cup with a comfortable 3‚Äì0 victory over Marseille at the Luzhniki Stadium. Crespo capitalised on an early defensive error by the French defence to open the scoring, before a well-placed Paolo Vanoli header before half-time and an Enrico Chiesa volley secured the triumph. The UEFA Cup win was later tainted by the release of footage showing Fabio Cannavaro receiving injections of neoton, raising suspicions that he was doping, although these claims have never been proved true. Joy at an early season trophy, the Italian Super Cup after victory over league champions A.C. Milan, was somewhat tempered by the sale of Ver√≥n, who was replaced by the disappointing Ariel Ortega, and early Champions League elimination at the hands of Rangers. Parma went on to finish fourth for a second consecutive season in the league, level with Internazionale, but losing the play‚Äìoff 3‚Äì1 against the Milan giants, consigning them to UEFA Cup football. In the ensuing summer, Hern√°n Crespo was sold to Lazio for a then world record transfer fee in search of a league title, with Mat√≠as Almeyda and S√©rgio Concei√ß√£o coming the other way and part of the fee used to fund the purchases of Savo Milo≈°eviƒá, but Parma would endure an unsatisfactory season in the ownership's eyes and Malesani made way for a brief return for Arrigo Sacchi in January 2001, who soon succumbed to poor health. New coach Renzo Ulivieri took over and led the side to fourth in the league once more, this time securing Champions League qualification, although Parma did lose the Coppa Italia final to Fiorentina 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. Replacing Crespo's goals had proved difficult and, although Marco Di Vaio proved a hit, M√°rcio Amoroso's continued poor form saw him offloaded to Borussia Dortmund for German record 56 million Deutsche Mark (‚Ç¨28.6 million) . Co-currently Parma signed Hidetoshi Nakata for 55 billion lire (‚Ç¨28.4 million) Emergence of financial troubles (2001‚Äì2004) The sale of Gianluigi Buffon and Lilian Thuram to rivals Juventus for a combined 180 billion lire (‚Ç¨92.96 million) paved the way to a disastrous start to the 2001-02 season, another early Champions League exit, this time at the hands of Lille, and the sacking of Uliveri in October and the hiring and firing of Daniel Passarella just two months later. Pietro Carmignani, perennially associated with the side's youth team, was appointed head coach and secured the most recently won prize in Parma's trophy cabinet when Parma came up against Juventus in yet another major final. Juventus won the first leg in Turin by two goals to one with Hidetoshi Nakata's injury-time goal proving crucial. Parma won the second leg 1‚Äì0 with an early deflected goal from J√∫nior, giving Parma the victory on away goals and a third Coppa Italia triumph. Only a run of good form late in the season saved Parma from relegation to Serie B. By 2002, every player that started the 1999 UEFA Cup triumph over Marseille had been moved on out of necessity. Parma's continued success throughout the 1990s and early 2000s earned them a tag as one of the \\"Seven Sisters\\" (Sette Sorelle), who dominated Italian football in that period, alongside Fiorentina, Internazionale, Juventus, Lazio, Milan and Roma. Cesare Prandelli was announced as the new man-in-charge of the Emilian side in May 2002. However, once more the winning players from the previous season were sold to raise money: Fabio Cannavaro went to Internazionale when he was club captain, Marco Di Vaio to Juventus and Johan Micoud to Werder Bremen and Parma slipped to an early season defeat in Tripoli to Juventus in the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana, but the depleted squad managed to finish above expectations in fifth place with the goals supplied by Adrian Mutu and Adriano in an attacking 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 formation, making up for the departure of Marco Di Vaio, and defensive solidity provided by Daniele Bonera and Matteo Ferrari. The following season, The sale of left-sided captain-to-be Mutu to Chelsea, injury to star striker Adriano, the culmination of Parmalat's financial meltdown - which resulted in the arrest of president Calisto Tanzi for embezzlement of money from parent company Parmalat and the re-formation of the club under a new name, Parma Football Club - and the threat of the club's continuing existence made life difficult for Parma, but they again finished fifth, in no small part due to the prolific Alberto Gilardino, who netted 23 league goals, a club record. On 28 April 2004, however, the club was declared insolvent. Calisto Tanzi's resignation came in January 2004. Decline on and off the pitch (2004‚Äì2008) Milan's San Siro in September 2007 After years of corporate and financial crisis due to the Crac Parmalat, Parma A.C. was renamed to Parma F.C. in June 2004. Prandelli's departure as manager preceded the 2004‚Äì05 season, as did the decision to revert to the club's traditional colours: white shirts again being adorned by black crosses, replacing the yellow and blue hoops associated with Parmalat's ownership. The club had to come out from previous sugar daddy model and saw Matteo Ferrari and Matteo Brighi were sold to Roma. Although Parma reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, they plummeted to their lowest finish since promotion fifteen years earlier, appointing and relieving Silvio Baldini of his duties in the space of a few months and hiring Pietro Carmignani. All of this despite another 23-league goal haul from Gilardino. Parma's league position meant they had to contest a two-legged play-off against Bologna in order to stay in the top tier of Italian football. They won the play-off 2‚Äì1 on aggregate, having lost the first leg at home by a solitary goal. With the club still not having found a new owner after it was put up for sale at the beginning of January 2005, Enrico Bondi was made president and charged with securing a sale, continuing to sell Parma's most valuable assets, such as Alberto Gilardino, who left for A.C. Milan at the cost of ‚Ç¨25M in the summer of 2005, having scored 50 league goals in 95 matches, and French goalkeeper S√©bastien Frey who departed for Fiorentina. The Emilian outfit ended the following season with a finish in tenth place, but the Calciopoli scandal saw their official position changed to seventh and assured them a return to the UEFA Cup. Players such as Daniele Bonera continued to be sold on for money and another new coach, Stefano Pioli, was appointed as the 2006‚Äì07 season approached. Claudio Ranieri, who saved Parma from relegation in 2007 On 24 January 2007, Tommaso Ghirardi was announced as new owner of Parma FC following a public auction sale following a failed bid from ex-Real Madrid director Lorenzo Sanz the previous year, which failed to meet the then-asking price of ‚Ç¨27m. Ghirardi, a 31-year-old entrepreneur and owner of Serie C2 club AC Carpenedolo, also became president of Parma F.C., ending three years of state-controlled management. Having qualifying for the Round of 32 of the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Cup, Parma were eliminated from the competition by S.C. Braga, who prevailed by a single goal to nil in both legs; the home match was played behind closed doors after the Italian Government ruled that Parma's stadium did not meet requirements set out following recent riots in a league match in Sicily. On 12 February, second- last placed Parma fired head coach Pioli and replaced him with Claudio Ranieri who, against overwhelming odds, managed to avoid relegation to Serie B on the final day of the season, before leaving at the end of the season. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Parma again battled with relegation. Three different head coaches (Domenico Di Carlo, H√©ctor C√∫per, and caretaker Andrea Manzo) took charge that season, but none were able to preserve Parma's Serie A status, as they lost 2‚Äì0 at home to champions Internazionale on the final day of the season, Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá eventually sealing their fate and consigning them to Serie B football after eighteen years in the top flight. Up and down after Ghirardi's purchase (2008‚Äì2015) Parma's stay in Serie B started badly under Luca Cagni, who was sacked six games into the season and replaced by Francesco Guidolin who guided the club to joint top at the half-way mark and a second-place finish, ending the season unbeaten at home and fired on with goals from Alberto Paloschi and Cristiano Lucarelli, finally securing promotion back to Serie A with a 2‚Äì2 draw on 16 May 2009 with two games left to play. Parma went on to finish the season in second place, 4 points behind eventual winners Bari. Parma's return to Serie A in 2009‚Äì10 started with good form, winning eight of the first sixteen matches and sitting in fourth position before Christmas, as Daniele Galloppa became the first Parma player to represent Italy in over three years, the longest period without Parma representation since Alberto Di Chiara became the first to play for Italy in 1992. Although Parma's form dropped off in the new year, despite the re- signing of fans' favourite Hern√°n Crespo they did manage to finish eighth in the final standings, narrowly missing out on qualification for the Europa League, just three points behind rivals Juventus. Head coach Guidolin's contract was not renewed and he left for Udinese, swapping posts with Parma's newly appointed Pasquale Marino in the summer of 2010. Parma started the 2010‚Äì11 season poorly and lay in sixteenth position at the Christmas break despite an unlikely return to form for Hern√°n Crespo who had scored eight goals, as pressure on Marino from the boardroom grew. However, Marino's time in charge ended on 3 April, when he was sacked by President Tommaso Ghirardi after a disappointing home defeat to rock-bottom Bari, which saw Parma fall within two points of the relegation zone with seven matches to go. His replacement, Franco Colomba, was appointed as a replacement on 5 April, having been out of a job since August, when he left Bologna before the first game of the season. Colomba brought about a dramatic change in fortunes, winning four of the seven games he took charge of, including three consecutive victories against top opposition (Internazionale, Udinese and Palermo) and the completion of a season double over rivals Juventus in the penultimate game of the season, having celebrated avoiding relegation the weekend before. On 9 January 2012, Ghirardi sacked Colomba and replaced him with Roberto Donadoni following a winless run of six matches that culminated in a 5‚Äì0 loss to Inter. Donadoni introduced a 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation that offered more defensive solidity than Colomba's 4‚Äì4‚Äì2. After a shaky start, Donadoni's side finished the season with 7 consecutive wins, a new club record in Serie A, and an impressive finish in eighth. The club was declared bankrupt in 2015 restarting from Serie D. Another rebirth (2015‚Äìpresent) The re-founded club, S.S.D. Parma Calcio 1913, was formed in July 2015, taking its name from the year of foundation of the predecessor club and beating off competition from a rival to secure a place in the 2015‚Äì16 Serie D under article 52 of N.O.I.F. as the representative of Parma. Ex-head coach Nevio Scala was appointed as president and former player Luigi Apolloni was chosen as head coach. In the club's first season, it sold over 9,000 season tickets, more than doubling the Serie D record. They won their first ever game in Serie D 2‚Äì1 against Villafranca Veronese, with 10,000 supporters in attendance.http://gazzettaworld.gazzetta.it/news/fans-parma-victory/ References Parma Parma Calcio 1913 ","title":"History of Parma Calcio 1913"},{"id":"30019078","text":"This is a list of Turkish Navy miscellaneous ships that have served past and present, from 10 July 1920Cevat √úlkekul, \\"Kurtulu≈ü Sava≈üƒ±'nda T√ºrk Denizcileri ve Cumhuriyet Bahriyesinin Kurulu≈üu\\" , Piri Reis Symposium, Office of Navigation of Hydrography and Oceanography. to present.

His compositional approach has combined traditional techniques with elements of the avant-garde. For most of his life resident in the UK, he has now retired from composition and currently lives in France. Biography Born in Paris, Wilkinson studied composition at Columbia and Princeton Universities; he also took some private lessons with Var√®se in New York. He published a number of analytical articles on works by Var√®se and Boulez. In England, he became one of the first independent composers to make use of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop after it opened in 1958. For a time Wilkinson was resident composer and musical director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, then musical director of the Royal National Theatre (1963‚Äì74). One of the first scores he composed in that post was for Peter Shaffer's The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1964); the result deeply impressed the playwright, who has described Wilkinson's work as \\"perhaps the best score for a play to be written since Grieg embellished Peer Gynt\\".Shaffer, Peter. The Collected Plays. Harmony Books, 1982: p. x Wilkinson subsequently wrote the incidental music to Shaffer's play Equus (1973). Other National Theatre productions for which Wilkinson wrote incidental music included Tom Stoppard's plays Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1967) and Jumpers (its premiere production, 1972). He also taught at the Royal Court Theatre studio, under the directorship of Keith Johnstone, from the autumn of 1964. Through his work at the National Theatre Wilkinson met Piers Haggard, who was working as an assistant director: the two worked together on the National Theatre production The Dutch Courtesan (1964).http://theatricalia.com/play/4k5/the-dutch-courtesan/production/9yj Having directed several TV dramas, Haggard was about to direct his first feature film and invited Wilkinson to score it.Wilkinson, Marc.

Literary origins Farmer has stated that he derived Khokarsa from Ambrose Bierce's short story \\"An Inhabitant of Carcosa\\" (1891), in which the narrator's spirit visits an ancient fallen civilization. Over time, Farmer states, the syllables of the name \\"Khokarsa\\" were transposed so that the civilization eventually became known as \\"Carcosa\\".Farmer, Philip Jos√©, \\"A Letter from Philip Jos√© Farmer\\" in Heritage of the Flaming God, Alan Hanson and Michael Winger, eds., Spokane, Washington: Waziri Publications, pages 87‚Äì88. An examination of Farmer's notes relating to the Khokarsa series has indicated that he also drew on classical sources to create his fictional civilization, such as Robert Graves' The White Goddess (which inspired the matriarchal basis of Khokarsan culture), Jessie L. Weston's classic Arthurian study From Ritual to Romance (whose \\"freeing of the waters\\" theme influenced Farmer's conception of the downfall of Khokarsan civilization), and the plays of Euripides (Farmer drew his depiction of the Khokarsan oracles directly from Euripides' description of the Oracle of Delphi).Carey, Christopher Paul, \\"The Archaeology of Khokarsa\\" in Farmerphile: The Magazine of Philip Jos√© Farmer, no. 9, July 2007, Paul Spiteri, ed., pages 2‚Äì7. Fictional history The origins of the Khokarsan civilization date back to 12,000 B.C., as the Khoklem people were expanding over the northern shore of the Kemu (the prehistoric northern inland sea of Central Africa). At this time, a man known as Sahhindar, the Gray-Eyed God, appeared in the region and came to be regarded by the locals as the god of plants, of bronze, and of Time, reputedly having been exiled from the land by his mother, the fertility goddess Kho, because he stole Time from her. Sahhindar appeared and reappeared among the Khoklem over a period of two thousand years, teaching them how to domesticate plants and animals, mine copper and tin, and make bronze tools, as well as teaching them the concept of zero. By circa 10,000 B.C. when the Khokarsa series begins, Sahhindar has brought the Khoklem from the Old Stone Age to the Bronze Age. ‚ÄúThe Chronology of Khokarsa‚Äù addendum in Hadon of Ancient Opar hints that Sahhindar is actually John Gribardsun, the time-traveling protagonist from Farmer‚Äôs 1972 novel Time‚Äôs Last Gift,Farmer, Philip Jos√©, \\"Chronology of Khokarsa\\" in Hadon of Ancient Opar, New York, NY: DAW Books, page 205. one of Farmer's many characters based on Tarzan. Geography and culture The empire of Khokarsa was centered on the shores of prehistoric Africa‚Äôs two great landlocked seas, the Kemu to the north in the Chad Basin and the Kemuwopar to the south in the Congo Basin. Around 13,000 B.C., a group of tribes called the Khoklem (the People of Kho) emigrated from the temperate savannas of what would later become the Sahara Desert after the end of the Ice Age, reaching the shores of the Kemu and pushing the Neanderthals and Neanderthal-human hybrids (the Klemqaba, or People of the Goat) to the south, and possibly assimilating some of them. Another group called the Klemsuh (the Yellow People) arrived in the area at approximately the same time. These peoples made livings fishing and hunting and gathering until the appearance of Sahhindar, the Gray-Eyed God, who taught them agriculture and advanced their culture dramatically. In 11,800 B.C., the hero Gahete of the Klemreskom, the People of the Fish-Eagle, was the first human to land on the island of Khokarsa in the northern Kemu. This island would eventually become the capital and hub of the great Khokarsan Empire. In the series, Opar is merely a mining outpost city in a much larger civilization created by Farmer. By the time of Hadon of Ancient Opar and Flight to Opar, the Khoklem had settled the shores of both primordial inland seas and founded the expansive Bronze Age civilization of Khokarsa. The Khokarsans had a written syllabary, understood the principles of algebra, employed catapults and Greek fire, had an advanced navy of unireme, bireme, and trireme galleys, implemented a solar calendar, and established a samurai- like class of swordsmen called the numatenu who wielded iron broadswords. The Khokarsan civilization was matriarchal, with the high priestess of Kho serving as queen and controlling everything in the society but military, naval, and engineering sectors, these latter being under the direct jurisdiction of the king, the high priest of the sun god Resu. At the opening of the Khokarsa series circa 10,000 B.C., a power struggle between the priestesses of Kho and the priests of Resu has been ongoing for over 800 years. This conflict erupts into civil war when King Minruth IV refuses to relinquish the throne to the hero Hadon, whose victory as champion of the Great Games of Klakor should bestow upon him the traditional right to marry the high priestess and assume the kingship. Because of Minruth‚Äôs play for power, the thirty queendoms of the empire are thrown into a state of bloody revolution as the priests attempt to assert their newfound authority over the priestesses.

Location Aghribs is a village and commune in the Kabylie region of Algeria. It is located 40 km north east of Tizi Ouzou and approximately 150 km east of Algiers. The village is at an altitude of 800 metres above sea level and at a distance of 10 km from the Mediterranean Sea. The People As a village, Aghribs is home to about 2000 people. It is the birthplace of Said Sadi, the co-founder and ex-president of the RCD, the Rassemblement pour la Culture et la Democratie. As of April 2013, the village oldest resident is Mr. Said Ameur, who is 104. Although archives are inexistent, it is a well established fact that Aghribs was founded by a family or families that left the village of Adrar, a village just a few kilometres away. Today, Aghribs‚Äôs main families are : Ameur, Ait Lounis, Belkacem, Ait Amara, Ait Yahya, Sadi (or Saadi), Meziani, Laimeche, Tamani, Aider and Ait Aider. In addition to these long established families, many others have joined the village in recent years. The School The School with the original building at the forefront The village school is one of the first schools opened in Kabylie by the old colonial power, France, opening its doors for the first time in 1892. During the war of independence (1954 -1962) Aghribs served as military camp for the French army. Parts of the school were used as a prison and interrogation centre. After Algeria‚Äôs independence in 1962, and until 1972, the military barracks were used as an orphanage for hundreds of children, orphaned by the war, who came from all over Kabylie. As a result, thousands of Kabyle children were educated at the village school. The Commune Administratively, Aghribs has seen many changes. From a Commune in its own right under the French, it became part of the commune of Freha in 1962. In 1984, following a national electoral boundary reorganisation, the village became a commune. The town hall is now located in the new town of Aguni Cherqi, a couple of kilometres outside the village. The economy There are no industries or large scale artisanal activity within the village. Agriculture is practiced on a very small scale and is used mostly to supplement family incomes. The village can still be considered fairly wealthy thanks to remittances from its hundreds of sons and daughters who work elsewhere in the country or overseas. Historically, Aghribs was well known for its Monday market. For over a hundred years, the market was a place where thousands of economic transactions were carried out every Monday by people who would come from all over Kabylie. The main activities included buying and selling animals (cows, oxen, sheep, donkeys,...), food stuffs (cereals, olive oil, spices, meat,...), agricultural tools, and so forth. However, in recent years, the market has shrunk markedly and is no longer the strong economic driver it once was. The War of Independence During the war of independence (1954 ‚Äì 1962), like most villages in Kabylie, Aghribs suffered heavy casualties. Twenty four men and a woman, most in their twenties and the youngest only seventeen, lost their lives. Here they are: Aider Amar, Aider Boudjema, Aider Said Ameziane, Ait Aider Amar, Ait Aider Md Arezki, Ait Aider Said Oubelaid, Ait Aider Said (Oumeri, Ait Aider Said Ouramdane, Ait Amara Md (MohandOuh), Ait Lounis Amar, Ait Lounis Ferroudja, Ait Lounis Lounes, Ait Yahia Ali, Ameur Amar, Ameur Ferhat, Belaidi Ramdane, Belkaceme Ahmed, Belkaceme Meziane, Bensaid Rabah, Laimeche Amar, Laimeche Md Amechtouh, Meziani Md, Sadi Abdellah (Amirouche), Sadi Ouidir (Rabah), Sadi Said.

After the independence of Algeria, the commune was called A√Øn El Hammam within the framework of the arabization of the names of place. However, the town (now the capital of the commune) continues to be locally named Michelet, or Michli, Michyi, which are eroded or Kabylian forms of Michelet. Asqif n-·π¨mana is only the name of a part of this urban center with sprawling ramifications. Indeed Asqif n Tmana is the old northern entrance of the town corresponding to the ancient hamlet of Ait-Sidi-Said comprising the cemetery where is buried the bard Kabyle Si Muhand U M'hand . Other information, refer to another former name of the region before the French colonization, which was Tala BUDHI (literary translation: the fountain of butter). History During the Roman Empire the town was called Trisipa and was a civitas. Trisipa was the seat of an ancient bishopric, which survives today as a titular bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church. Two bishops of the town are known. Victor, attendee at the Council of Carthage (411) and Felix, who signed a group letter to Paul, the Patriarch of Constantinople regarding Monothelites.Joseph-Anatole Toulotte, Geography of Christian Africa: Proconsular.

Politics and Administration   Seat of the People's Municipal Assembly  The seat of the People's Municipal Assembly (French: Assembl√©e Populaire Communale or APC) is located in the Ighil n'Ssebt area, erstwhile location of a weekly market by that name, at the southern end of A√Øt Hichem, on the premises of a former workroom once run by the White Sisters. New premises intended to house the elected assembly's administrative center are in the process of being constructed in the Taqa√¢ett Idebbalen area at the other end of A√Øt Hichem.  The People's Municipal Assembly  Seat of the PMA of A√Øt Yahia A√Øt Yahia's first elected People's Municipal Assembly was presided by Hocine Ben Younes from the village of A√Øt Ziri. Hocine Ben Younes died during his term, and was replaced by his first vice president, Mohamed Ait Tayeb from the village of Igouras, who served until the end of the term in 1989. Since the arrival of the multiparty system in Algeria in 1989, it has been the FFS (Socialist Forces Front) and the RCD (Rally for Culture and Democracy), two parties with a stronghold in the Kabylie region, who have succeeded to the presidency of the municipal assembly. The RCD won the 1989 elections. Boussa√¢d Ait Oufella, from the village of Tagounits, was elected president of the municipal assembly. In 1994, the RCD and the FFS boycotted the elections. The State, to fill the vacancy, appointed a municipal executive delegation. Djillali Ben Gougam, from the village of A√Øt Ziri, was appointed as the head of this delegation. In 1997, the FFS won the elections with a relative majority. Mourad Ait Hamadouche, from the village of Taka, was elected president of the PMA. He stepped down in 2000, before the end of his term. His first deputy, Mohand Ben Slimane, from the village of Koukou, succeeded him until the end of the term. In 2002, Mohand Ben Slimane, then member of the FFS, was reelected to the head of the PMA. But when the FFS decided to step back from municipal leadership, Mohand Ben Slimane withdrew from the FFS and thus remained at his post of president (as an independent) until the end of his term. In the municipal election of 2007, the commune's presidency went to Tahar Ben Slimane of the RCD, which obtained a majority of seats. The eleven seats of the assembly were shared between three parties: RCD, FFS, and FLN. In 2012, an agreement was sealed by the elected officials by constituting a majority in order to manage the commune's affairs and the FLN runs the commune.  Schools  The large villages each have a primary school: A√Øt Hichem, A√Øt Ziri, Tafraout, Issendl√®ne, Koukou, Tagounits, Takanna, Taka, Igoufaf, and A√Øt Si Amara.

Its GPS coordinates are 36.49935,3.936558. In truth, Bounouh is the name of a town and, mistakenly, its name has been given a meaning to represent the whole Arch of Ath Sma√Øl. This Ath Sma√Øl should not be mistaken for a namesake in the Wilaya of Beja√Øa. The Arch of Ath Sma√Øl is located to the south west of the Wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou and is in close proximity to the Da√Øras of Boghni (driving distance from Bounouh is about 10.9 km through Thala Oulili and Amezaourou and under 9.6 km through Ighil Aanane and Amezaourou) and Dra√¢-El Mizan (driving distance from Bounouh is approximately 13 km) whereas the bird's flight distance from Bou-Nouh to Boghni is merely 5 km and this is testimony of the hilly landscape. Boghni to Dra√¢ El Mizan driving distance is 15.4 km. It has become fashionable to change the spelling of Bou-Nouh to Bounouh! There is also Ait Bounouh in Tiznit, Morocco. Ait Sma√Øl is a mountainous region and offers many beautiful landscapes. Thala Oulili is merely 400m above sea level whilst Helouane is at an altitude of more than 1200m. Again there is a namesake Helouane within the Wilaya of Beja√Øa. There are sensational panoramic views and splendid walks throughout Ath Sma√Øl to charm any demanding visitor. The Arch of Ath Sma√Øl has an area of 26.99 km2http://www.tiziouzou-dz.com/decoupage-administratif.htm# with 80% in rural setting. The population is 9,731 inhabitants distributed over 23 villages. Ath Sma√Øl is bordered by Boghni to the North, the villages of Ath Mendes and Ath Kouffi (District of Boghni) to the East, The Djurdjura Mountains, Ait Laaziz and Taghzout (Province of Bouira) to the South and finally Frikat and Ain Zaou√Øa on its Western flank. As is customary throughout Kabylia, villages in Bounouh are often perched on hills so as to defend themselves against any invasion. Recently, people from Tizi L Had, Ibouhat√®ne, Chebaba, and other villages have started to settle in the plains of Lemhella where the number of houses has kept increasing year on year.

From L‚ÄôMerdja, one can visit Amalou (36.496125,3.944991) and Awrir (36.502363,3.941618). From Bou-Nouh, one can return towards Taghza following the road of Ath Sma√Øl-Boghni and passing by Ikhalfounene (36.50155,3.935797), Amezaourou (36.511493,3.944541), Alma B-Uli (36.514571,3.935335), Lejnan N Cheikh (36.515942,3.936376), and Taghza. From Taghza, one could drive back to Boghni following the road of Ath Sma√Øl-Boghni also known as Ighil Aanane (36.522925,3.941939) and pass at close proximity to the forest of Tazrouts (36.522822,3.944128) and finish at the higher secondary school (Lyc√©e) Zamoum Mohamed of Boghni. History During French occupation of Algeria, Bou-Nouh was a commune within the District of Dra√¢-El Mizan and ahead of the now Da√Øra of Boghni. Ath Sma√Øl entered history at the beginning of the 16th century. The Turks (Ottoman Empire) set up a Bordj, a few hundred metres from the Lyc√©e Zamoum (close proximity to family Terkmani) in Boghni to collect taxes. This was attacked and subsequently destroyed on 16 July 1756 by Iflissen and Ath Sma√Øl and consequently the Turks left the garrison. However, nothing is said or mentioned about the megalithicMegalith structures in Tissamamine. Tissamamine is known locally as the shortcut to walk from Bou- Nouh towards Chebaba. Back in the 70's, it was littered with large T shaped structures. Their significance is not clear and not documented. Nowadays, only the large and bulky axial rocks lay on the ground as sadly the flat stones have been broken down and used in the construction of private houses. There was however one remaining structurePhotograph needed on the grounds of Cheikh Ben Abderrahmane until 2011 when this one also mysteriously disappeared without a trace, its fate unbeknown to the locals. Even the ground around its placement was completely reshaped to wipe out any trace of existence. Visitors to the mosque could lean at its entrance and call their beloved ones to come back, especially immigrants. It was told that outcomes were excellent. According to religious records, the Catholic Church was set up in Bou-Nouh in 1876http://www.djurdjurakabylie.com/Les%20chretiens%20de%20Kabylie/Les%20chretiens%20de%20Kabylie.htm and references therein. Also and search for Boghni and Bou-Nouh. and soon after the boys and girls schools (in Bou-Nouh) were founded in 1877 and 1892, respectively . It is not clear from the records as to when Bou-Nouh benefited from a health clinic. The Catholic Church held a conference in 1937 in the commune and this denotes the importance and prestige of Bou-Nouh. However, long before the French set foot in Algeria, one could not forget the illustrious Cheikh Sidi M'hamed Ben Abderrahmane who had set up his own illuminating Tariqa Rahmani in Ait Sma√Øl in 1769! The Rahmania, which preached a form of passive religious belief, was to play a role in Algerian insurrection against the French. Inside the mosque there is a poster summarizing the spiritual and combative sides of Cheikh Ben Abderrahmane. Even after his death, his mosque continued to play a massive role in all uprisings and this led to several closures as a form of punishment. Cheikh Mohand Ameziane Aheddad, from Seddouk Oufela (Beja√Øa), a fervent preacher of the Rahmania which he studied in Ath Irathen and Ath Sma√Øl, allied himself along El Mokrani in 1871 to lead a rebellion against the French invasion. After his capture, Cheikh Aheddad died on 29 April 1873 at the prison of El Koudiat (Constantine) at the age of 83 and he was initially buried in Constantine against his known wish and then later exhumed and reburied in Seddouk to fulfil his request to be buried in his beloved home town. After the conquest of Kabylie in 1871, the French embarked on founding a number of towns between Dra√¢-El Mizan and Larba√¢ N Ath Irathen (ex Fort Napol√©on and Fort National), such as Dra√¢-El Mizan (1873), Beaupr√®tre (1874), Pirette (now Ain Zaouia) (1875), Tizi-Gheniff (1875) and Boghni (1876). From Larba√¢ Nath Irathen to B√©ja√Øa were created Fr√©ha (1882), Azazga (1882) and Yakouren (1888). Then the French adopted, using a number of measures between 1871 and 1878, the American Homestead rule to confiscate and give land free to French Colons and their number swelled to 207,615 on 1 January 1888!Le d√©veloppement g√©ographique de la colonisation agricole en Alg√©rie, Henri Busson, in Annales de G√©ographie, Year 1898, Volume 7, Number 31, pp. 34-54. This led to the beginning of the erosion of the socio-economic structure which supported Kabylie and to a larger extent Algeria. Although, it could be argued that land productivity increased, the (agricultural) food exports from Algeria to France soared from 9.7 to in excess of 125million French Francs for only the ports of Algiers, Annaba, and Oran over the period of 1838-40 to 1885-87. Library Farid Ali Tizi L Had, destroyed by the French in November 1958 but the mosque and eucalyptus tree survived the relentless bombing The indomitable Ath Sma√Øl, who rose against the Turks and French colonisation, played its crucial part in the Algerian war for independence which started in 1954 and lasted until 1962. Many regional leaders originated from Ath Sma√Øl and several people lost their lives or have been imprisoned. Tizi L Had was turned to rubble by the French canons in November 1958 and, as by miracle, only the mosque stood unshaken. Both Bou-Nouh and Boghni honoured a number of the heroes by naming streets and schools after them. The widows from Ath Sma√Øl often evoke a number of poems to recount the horrors of the war and their sufferings. Students at the University Mouloud Mammeri of Tizi-Ouzou originating from the Arch of Ath Sma√Øl took part in the foundation of the Comit√© Anti-Repression in 1980 and played an active role in the movement that fashioned the Berber Spring which led to the recognition of the Berber language and culture,M'hamed Lakrimi in autobiography, unpublished. threatened with certain extinction. After independence, the strong but not so rich Bounouh lost its status of commune and the ever-developing Boghni was promoted in its place. At Ath Sma√Øl, all roads pass by the side of the villages, because the villages came to exist first and the road network followed much later on. At Ath Sma√Øl, even walking paths had names such as Adjroud, Lburath, Tissamamine, Tassawent L Had, etc. Even small patches of land carried names which are beyond comprehension such as Alma Bwuli (literally land of sheep), Lemhella, Taghza, Tabaquit Irumiyen (literally the French or Roman table), Lemqessa, etc. This demonstrates the historical heritage of Ath Sma√Øl. In Boghni, however, the road network came to exist first as part of the link between Dra√¢-El Mizan and Larba√¢ Nath Irathen (ex- Fort Napol√©on and Fort National) and then people moved in afterwards. Based on knowledge from the early 1970s, a large number of the first inhabitants or the people to set up business in Boghni originated mostly from Ath Sma√Øl such as the families Hadjarab, Abbas, Amrani, Ayad, B√©char, Bouha, Boukhalfa, Chabane, Chemoune, Chergui, Djebbar, Guirad, Hamoudi, Idir, Kaanane, Lamrani, Riche, Semsar, Touah, Zourdani, etc. and very few from other villages such as the Families of Iouadarene, Saidani [Moh Said Nath Ou Said was the first to own a lorry in Boghni] and Yahiat√©ne (Ath Mendes), Agdal, Dahmani, Kadri, Larbi and Yahiaoui (Ath Kouffi), followed by the Haddadi (La√¢zib N‚ÄôCheikh). There was only a tiny influx from neighbouring Mechtras and Ouadhias which were already benefiting from good infrastructure in terms of land, roads and water. Other families include Amarouche (from B√©jaia), Belhadj Ali, Berkouk, Benamar, Dr Ben Lahreche, Benlarbi, Berkouk, Hamrani, Haroun, Kara, Lamara, Madani, Marouf (from Ath Yenni), Meghari, Mitiche, Tamimount, Touati, etc. Other families which settled in Algiers and in other parts of Algeria are Aissani, Lakrimi, Sa√¢di, Amrioui (Tizi L Had) and Ziani (Ibouhat√©ne). The Catholics established a College of Further Education (Centre de Formation Professionnelle) in Boghni where the first 20 technicians to be employed by Sonatrach when it opened the Arzew oil refinery (near Oran) were formedC'√©tait une longue fid√©lit√©: √† l'Alg√©rie et au Rwanda, Armand Duval, 1998, , page 81. included pupils from Ath Smail.

A new Town Hall with better facilities was built and the old town Hall was changed into a Center of Further Education. Economics and infrastructure Despite its glorious past and harbouring several wealthy families, people from Ath Sma√Øl never sought to invest locally and Bou-nouh is actually a poor town. In a census published in 2001, it is lagging in 11th place from the bottom, behind 40 other communes within the province of Tizi-Ouzou.Carte de la Pauvret√© en Alg√©rie, published by Agence nationale de l‚ÄôAm√©nagement du Territoire, 2001, pages 92-93, Minist√®re de l‚ÄôAction Sociale et de la Solidarit√© Nationale, Programme des Nations Unies pour le d√©veloppent, also available from Neighbouring Frikat has a much higher ratio of wealth than Bou-Nouh. The poverty index means that Bou-Nouh could not self-support itself. Its entrepreneurial citizen preferred to invest and set up their commercial ventures and industries outside Ath Sma√Øl, namely in Boghni and as far afield as Algiers. In truth, the landscape, road networks and lack of electricity, water and telephone were not conducive to a business and entrepreneurial environment. Despite one hydroelectric power station on its territory and another in adjacent Ath Kouffi, the homes in Ath Sma√Øl only received electricity in the late 80‚Äôs after much protest and people stopped lighting their candles and afegag. Drinking water is now available in most houses and it is planned to supply cooking gas to every house in Ath Sma√Øl. Although several villages have now been connected with gas the actual supply is yet to be switched on. Due to be inaugurated in November 2012, the valve has remained shamefully and indeterminately closed because villages not yet connected to the gas supply objected. The stalemate is beyond reason; when some villages were not connected to electricity in the 1980s, such was the case of Thala Oulili and Taghza, the villages which today objected to the switching of the gas never uttered a shred of support and these villages went on went for years without any electricity and intermittent drinking water. The local administration has a challenge to resolve this very sad state of affairs! Most farming land is located in Azaghar. Azaghar represents a truly vast expanse and for land attached to Ath Sma√Øl this represents Thiwririne, bordering Frikat and Ain Zaou√Øa, Lemqessa, Thoulmouts, Taghza, and Lemhella where wheat, barley and fodder are cultivated. This is why the French erected a railway line crossing this rich and vast land to transport the goods. Viaducts in good condition are still in existence at Thiwrine, known locally as Lghar n Tekoukt, and at Laanasser in Boghni either side of the river between Azagher (land of Saidani Moh Said N Ath U Said) and Azouggar (land of Yahiatene). As far as trees are concerned, olives yield the largest revenue in Ath Sma√Øl followed by dried figs and acorns. Families cultivate their small holdings from September to May and allotments along the river in the summer. People also raise chicken and sometimes sheep or cows to help supplement the family income by selling a lamb or a calf every year. Ath Sma√Øl is also famous for its craft in pottery, raffia, weaving and sewing of Berber dresses. Otherwise, Ath Sma√Øl has little to offer in terms of jobs and industry. There is only one post office which covers all villages, two middle secondary schools and six primary schools for a sparse population scattered over 23 villages and nearly 10,000 inhabitants . School children lead a demeaning life, without public transport to school; they endure long and arduous journeys, as is the case for the children from Thiwririne and Taghza to attend The Primary School Ahmed Zourdani at Ibouhat√©ne and from Helouane or Taghza or Thala Oulili to the Brothers Kaanane middle secondary school at Bou-Nouh. These walking journeys consist of a few kilometres return journey to school on a daily basis. Bounouh have just commissioned a second middle school,Enfin un deuxi√®me coll√®ge pour la commune de Bou-Nouh (Boghni), Journal Libert√©, 13 Septembre 2011. two health clinics at Helouane and Ath Telha, and the library named after Farid Ali, premises for the unemployed, cooking gas, and a highly performing football team, The IRBB (Itihad Ryadhi Baladiat Bounouh), to foster the fantastic local talent. However, children are very motivated and their dedication is unsurpassable given the miserable economic and sociological upheavals in Kabylie. Nowadays, there are still 600 pupils from Ath Sma√Øl commuting to the higher secondary school (Lyc√©e Zamoum) in Boghni. It is for this reason that the town has tabled a proposal for a high secondary school to share with the neighbouring commune of Frikat, etc. It was not until the late 1980s that Ath Sma√Øl had its first children complete postgraduate studies. During French colonisation, good pupils from Ath Sma√Øl achieved an excellent and envious Certificat d‚ÄôEtudes Primaires (aged 12 to 13) and stopped education (mostly due to family pressure and lack of means to pursue their studies). Of course there were a few exceptions such as Belaid Zawadi, Ahcene Lamrani, Belkacem Lakrimi, and a few others. Given the lack of employment, people feel compelled to emigrate outside the region and look for work in other parts of Algeria and even abroad. Families rely immensely on war and work pensions to stave off the nightmare of poverty. The lack of economic development at Ath Sma√Øl is also rendered even more difficult, in fact complicated, by its proximity to Boghni which used to be the most developed town in Algeria in the 70s. Again in the 70s and 80s, Ath Sma√Øl was neglected by the administrators of Boghni to the extent that the provision of public transport was withdrawn. Fortunately, the Belgacem brothers from L‚ÄôMerdja stepped in with their coaches to take people to Boghni, Draa El Mizan and even to Rouiba for people employed at the state company for transport, SONACOM. Nowadays, the commune of Bou-Nouh continues to search for its destiny. It is heavily dependent on state subsidies and its administrative representatives shoulder a massive responsibility. Arts Ath Sma√Øl is well known for its pottery, despite the proximity of Ma√¢tkas and Ouadhias. Women decorate their own designs ;http://kimvip.skyrock.com/5.html and http://www.culture.fr/recherche/?typeSearch=collection&SearchableText;=Bou- Nouh&SearchWhere; they exploit several kinds of clay which they steal from open fields, usually on the day of the market which men attend in Boghni on Sundays. Women are very entrepreneurial; they make soap using spent cooking oil and marinate olives, tomatoes and peppers. During shortages of candles, they light the afegags using again spent oil. They embraced Recycle, Reduce and Reuse from an early age; in hardship, this was their motto. Just like men went to markets in Boghni on Sundays and Dra√¢-El Mizan on Thursdays, women had their own market on Wednesdays. Although, men were tolerated, stalls were run by women. They sold jewellery, pottery, and craft objects, especially made using raffia. The market is held near the Catholic Church. Monument Rabia Ziani, a passionate, well published writer and pedagogue, is from Ath Sma√Øl.http://www.livrescq.com/livrescq/?p=865 [Rabia Ziani : Ma vie est un roman in LivrEscq, Litt√©rature Alg√©rienne no 7, 15 July 2010] and http://www.blogg.org/blog-85611-billet- rabia_ziani_portrait_d_un_ecrivain_race-1219811.html.

Religious heritage Cathedral Inside Cheikh Ben Abderrahmane mosque Cheikh Ben Abderrahmane provides a vantage point for a panoramic view of its surrounding villages and extends to Boghni Ath Sma√Øl has a unique experience in the coexistence of two religions, namely the Catholic Church with the Nuns and Priests in Bou-Nouh and Islamic mosques of Sidi Ben Abderrahmane barely a kilometre away, Reba√¢ine Wali (40 Saints) at Awrir, Sidi Mansour at Tizi L Had, Si Mhend U Idir at Ibouhat√©ne, and Ath Sidi Lounis at Tala Oulili. Nowadays, it is mostly for the Cheikh Ben Abderrahmane that Ath Sma√Øl is most famous for. The Saint exists both at Ath Sma√Øl and Al Hama in Algiers. Even his death in 1793 became a legend; the people of Algiers and of Ath Sma√Øl embarked in a dispute about his corpse because each side wanted him for their region and started stealing each other his corpse. Calm resumed when both the inhabitant of Ath Sma√Øl found the Saint buried at their cemetery and the people of Algiers also found the Saint at their cemetery. It was customary for the Ath Sma√Øl to vow on (literally: the Saint who split in two), in reference to this mysterious doubling of the tomb. This explains why he is also known as Bou Qabrine, i.e. the Saint with two tombs. Today, the two zaou√Øas of Bou-Nouh and Algiers which carry his name continue to draw visitors from all corners of Algeria, especially at religious festivals. The Cheikh Sidi M‚Äôhemed Ben Aberrahmane is a native of Ath Sma√Øl and was born around 1715 in the village of Ba√¢li. He is said to be a descendant of Fatima Ezzahra, the daughter of Prophet Mohamed (his lineage is Cheikh Sidi M‚Äôhemed son of Abderahmane son of Ahmed son of Ben Youcef son of Abi Kacem son of Ali Ibrahim son of Abderahmane son of Ahmed son of El Hussein son of Mohamed son of El Hussein son of Fatima Ezzahra).Une histoire, des artistes, et une qu√™te de d√©veloppement, Amar Ouramdane, La D√©p√™che de Kabylie, 28 Juillet 2008. He studied cultural sciences at the Zaou√Øa of Cheikh Essedik Ouarab of Larba√¢ N Ath Irathen, moved to Algiers, accomplished his Hajj at Mecca (Saudi Arabia) and then to El Azhar in Cairo (Egypt) where he spent 25 years studying and carrying out research in theology .For his different placements, he is also known as Sidi Abderrahmane El Gechtouli El Djerdjeri Al Azhari. He learned the figh under Cheikh Mohamed Salem El Hafnaoui who sent him to India and Sudan to teach the Koran and the Sunna. He invented his own religious path called Tariqa Rahmania. After fulfilling this mission, he returned to Egypt. In 1769, he returned to Algeria, further developed his path and settled himself between Algiers and Ath Sma√Øl where he set up the zaou√Øa of the Ghechtoula at Ath Sma√Øl. It is thus at Ath Sma√Øl where he established his zaou√Øa and taught Koran and the El Khaloutia method to his followers. After a few years he felt the urge to expand his teaching to a larger audience. He settled in El Hama (Algiers) where again he established his zaou√Øa. He died in 1793 at Ath Sma√Øl. Given the common heritage, Bou-Nouh is now twinned with Sidi M‚Äôhemed in Algiers.

He was the leader of the MacShane in the late 16th century and early 17th century, and sought control of the O'Neill Clan, fighting with his brother against Hugh O'Neill. Early life Henry was born to the ruling family of Ulster at the time. His father is known to history as \\"Shane the Proud\\", though in his own lifetime he went by Sean Donnellach O'Neill, as he was fostered by the Donnelly clan. It is believed Henry's mother was Catherine MacDonnell, Shane's first wife, which makes him one of Shane's oldest and legitimate children. He had many half brothers, but his only full brother was Shane Og, Shane O'Neill's oldest son. He was fostered in the households of the O'Cahan's, the O'Cuinn's and possibly MacDonnell Gallowglass, due to the danger posed by other O'Neill family members. Henry led his half brothers Hugh Gaveloch and Con MacShane O'Neill. Collectively the brothers were known as the \\"Mac Shanes\\", and waged a continual war from 1583 to 1591 for domination of Ulster with the backing of a Scottish army made up of Macleans and MacDonnells. Push for power Henry and Con made a push for power in the summer of 1584; their actions precipitated the temporary collapse of the authority of Turlough Luineach O'Neill. Hugh and Art spent two years in Scotland looking for help from their kinsman Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean. Maclean landed with a force of 3,000 men in Lough Foyle and travelled to free Henry and Con from the custody of Turlough. Although Henry and Con remained with Turlough, the O'Donelly's and O'Cahan's defected to Mclean's side. When Turlough was thought to have died, the brothers were freed. But Con left, and without his presence western Tyrone was exposed to a direct attack from Hugh Roe O'Donnell, the R√≠ of Tyrconnell. Although after the death of Turlough, Henry was the strongest candidate for becoming the O'Neill, Hugh O'Neill made a direct bid for leadership and mustered a large force, marching toward the inaugural stone in Tullyhogue. Henry was unable to quickly retaliate, as he and his brother Art were imprisoned in Dublin Castle in 1585 by Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, who was on a tour of the north that year. They both escaped, ironically, with Hugh Roe O'Donnell in 1592. Hugh Roe returned to Tyrconnell, but the MacShanes were not so lucky. Art died from exposure, having suffered more for his advanced age compared to his companions during his imprisonment, and after having a rock dropped on his foot during their flight from the castle, in Glenmalure, during the escapers' desperate trek towards the land of Fiach McHugh O'Byrne, and Perrot enabled Hugh O'Neill and Turlough Luineach to attack the territory of James O'Donnelly, the main supporter of the MacShanes. Relationship with Hugh O'Neill He opposed his first cousin, Hugh M√≥r O'Neill, the 2nd Earl of Tyrone continuously during the 1590s and into the 1600s, alongside his brothers. Henry and Hugh M√≥r battled for supremacy over two decades, and Henry was subject to long imprisonment by Hugh; but after Henry's son married Hugh's daughter he fought for Hugh during the Nine Years' War. When Hugh Rua fled to Europe, the English seized his lands and set up a jury to redistribute them; the jury contained many of his enemies, including Henry and some of his brothers. Henry was granted a large estate from this land in Orior, County Armagh.  Known children and grandchildren Children *Henry Og MacShane - Henry's son, Henry Og, married Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone's daughter Cortine, and was knighted Sir Henry McShane O'Neill. He was killed by the forces of Sir Cahir O'Doherty on 6 May 1608 during O'Doherty's Rebellion following the Burning of Derry. Henry Og had a son named Sir Felim Roe, and a daughter who married Brian mac Hugh Oge O'Neill, Lord of the Feeva, ancestor of Charles Henry O'Neill \\"The Barrister\\", of the Feeva, ancestor of the O'Neill Conroys of Newfoundland through his only daughter Elizabeth and James Gerv√© Conroy, whose descent is now numerous. Padr√© Carlos, or \\"San Carlos\\" of Monsef√∫ Per√∫, (died 1966) was of this line. *Con Boy McShane ‚Äì Son of Henry.

He was an emeritus professor in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University. Education Acton began his education in the Salem City School system. He left at the end of 9th grade to attend boarding school at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, from which he graduated in 1939. He then attended Princeton University, obtaining his Bachelor of Science degree in 1943, and his Master of Science degree in chemical engineering in 1944. He was drafted into the Army in June 1944, and worked for the U.S. Army at Oak Ridge, at a facility that played a key role in the Manhattan Project, for the remainder of World War II. After the war, he became the second graduate from Carnegie Institute of Technology to earn a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. Career Acton spent three years at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards' Institute for Numerical Analysis at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he worked on a machine called SWAC (Standards Western Automatic Computer), one of the first digital computers. In 1952, he returned to Princeton to teach in the mathematics department, and served as director of the Analytical Research Group.Leitch, Alexander (1978) A Princeton Companion, Princeton University Press. While there, his group worked on military weapons, contributing to systems such as the U-2 spy plane and the Nike anti-aircraft missile. He also became an expert and teacher on the IAS Machine, another of the first computers, which was located at the Institute for Advanced Study. During this time, Acton worked with other important figures in early computing, including Princeton Professor John Tukey, who coined the terms \\"software\\" and \\"bit,\\" and Thomas Kurtz, who went on to co-invent the computer language BASIC. Other contemporaries he knew and worked with included Albert W. Tucker, Grace Hopper, Richard Feynman, James H. Wilkinson, Claude Shannon, John Backus, and John Nash. Acton moved to the Department of Electrical Engineering in 1955. In 1963, he made the first of two extended visits to the Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur, India, where he helped establish the school's early computing facilities and courses. He initially stayed for one year, and he returned in 1967 to teach and offer organizational advice. As computing evolved, Princeton's electrical engineering department added \\"computer science\\" to its name before the Department of Computer Science became its own department in 1985. Acton retired as professor of computer science in 1989. Books Acton is known for his 1970 book Numerical Methods That Work, which was reissued in 1997 by the Mathematical Association of America. More recently, he published Real Computing Made Real: Preventing Errors in Scientific and Engineering Calculations. Philanthropy Before his death, Acton made several anonymous scholarship donations to students in the Salem City School District in Salem County, NJ. Before he died, he made it clear to friends and confidants that he wanted youth in the Salem area, where he was born and raised, to have access to the educational experiences he enjoyed. The Forman S. Acton Educational Foundation was officially incorporated in October 2014, and it currently provides financial assistance for youth in the greater Salem community.
