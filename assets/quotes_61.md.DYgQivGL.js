He took the single wicket of the 19-year-old John Dewes and scored 1 and 6 with the bat. The following year he appeared thrice for Glamorgan, claiming seven more wickets (though never more than two in an innings) and managing a top score of 21 in his final game at Derby. After this, he did his National Service, played league cricket for a while in the north of England, and eventually emigrated to Canada.

It is the fifth track on Davis's 1959 album Kind of Blue and an innovative experiment in modal jazz. The track features Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb and Bill Evans. The piece has no written melody, but is rather defined by a set of chord changes that are improvised over using various modes. Each musician separately chose the number of bars for each of the modal passages in his solo. Davis gets credit for the song form, but Evans is credited with the opening 4-bar vamp over Cmaj7 and G9sus4, which is the opening theme to his ballad improvisation \\"Peace Piece\\". Because of the presence of this vamp, \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" is usually played as a ballad. The modes used in \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" are as follows: *C Ionian (natural major scale) *A Mixolydian (Major with a minor 7th) *B Ionian *G Harmonic Minor over D Phrygian Dominant (alternates over bass notes D and E) *G Dorian An alternate take of \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" is included on most recent re-issues of Kind of Blue as the sixth and last track.

The aim of the essay is to ridicule contemporary poets.  Content  \\"Peri Bathous\\" is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the \\"dunces\\". It is a prose parody of Longinus' Peri Hupsous (On the Sublime), in that he imitates Longinus' system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets. According to John Upton, the title reflects an actual phrase in Longinus' treatise, Œµ·º∞ ·ºîœÉœÑŒπŒΩ ·ΩïœàŒøœÖœÇ œÑŒπœÇ ·º¢ Œ≤Œ¨Œ∏ŒøœÖœÇ œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑, in which \\"Œ≤Œ¨Œ∏ŒøœÖœÇ\\" is a scribal error for \\"œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÖœÇ\\".John Upton, Critical Observations on Shakespeare, 2nd ed., London, 1748, pp.255‚Äì256. Upton's reading of Longinus does not, however, appear to have been universally accepted. With the essay, Pope introduced the use of the term \\"bathos\\" (Greek Œ≤Œ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ, depth, the antonym to ·ΩïœàŒøœÇ (hupsos), height) to mean a failed attempt at sublimity, a ridiculous failure to sustain it, or, more generally, an anticlimax. Although Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to \\"sink\\", the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things. First, it violates \\"decorum\\", or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition. = Comic use of the figures of speech = In chapter X, titled Of Tropes and Figures: and first of the variegating, confusing and reversing Figures, Pope explains the comic use of the tropes and figures of speech.William Kurtz Wimsatt, Monroe C. Beardsley (1954) The verbal icon p.176 This part is continued in chapter XI, titled The Figures continued: Of the Magnifying and Diminishing Figures. Among the figures covered are: Catachresis.  Models of reference  The nearest model for Pope's essay is the Treatise of the Sublime by Boileau of 1712. Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's (and Swift's) literary adversaries, Leonard Welsted, had issued a \\"translation\\" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau. Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this \\"sublime,\\" Pope commented upon and countered their system with his Peri Bathous in the Swift- Pope-Gay-Arbuthnot Miscellanies. Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be \\"awe-inspiring,\\" Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might \\"sink\\" in poetry, satirizing the very men who were allied with Ambrose Philips. Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's Odes, and the rivalry broke down along political lines. One example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting. In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial genres, still life ranked the lowest. However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word \\"stiffen,\\" evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this \\"low\\" genre: :Many Painters who could never hit a Nose or an Eye, have with Felicity copied a Small-Pox, or been admirable at a Toad or a Red-Herring. And seldom are we without Genius's for Still Life, which they can work up and stiffen with incredible Accuracy. (\\"Peri Bathous\\" vi).

It was inaugurated in 1910. Description The bridge is a combined arch and beam bridge made of three reinforced concrete beams vaulted underneath and resting on two supports. Its vertical sides dressed in granite, the bridge is 11.1 metres wide with a 6.7 metres wide roadway. In contrast to the parallel bridge Malmskillnadsbron, the Bridge of Regeringsgatan is using three arches to cross Kungsgatan; the central span, 14.5 metres in length, passes over the roadway below; while the two spans on it sides, 5.5 metres in length, passes over the pavements of Kungsgatan. The unwieldy intermediate supports makes effective usage of the street width below impossible, and substituting the present construction have therefore been suggested.  Notes  * In Swedish the word viadukt has a slightly different meaning from viaduct in English, and can thus signify basically any bridge stretching over land, typically a street or a railway, and itself typically part of a railway or motorway, regardless of the number of spans. Thus, in Swedish the Bridge of Regeringsgatan is therefore officially called a viadukt but name is here translated using the English word \\"bridge\\" instead.

The high-speed network began with the opening of the HSL 1 to France in 1997, and since then high-speed lines have been extended towards Germany with HSL 2 in 2002, HSL 3 from Li√®ge to the German border in 2009, and HSL 4 from Antwerp to the Dutch border in 2009.  Services  Four high-speed train services currently operate in Belgium: Thalys, Eurostar, InterCityExpress (ICE) and TGV. All operators stop in Brussels-South railway station, Belgium's largest train station. Some services also stop in Li√®ge and Antwerp. However, it's not possible to book a ticket on a domestic route between Brussels and one of these cities by Thalys. Frequent Belgian IC trains (that run every 15-30min) will do so instead and use the same high-speed lines. Eurostar connects Brussels to London St Pancras. The German ICE operates between Brussels-South, Li√®ge-Guillemins railway station and Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof via K√∂ln (Cologne). Thalys connects Brussels with Paris (in 1h22), Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Cologne and D√ºsseldorf. Lines There are three high-speed lines in Belgium which support operation, and one that supports speeds up to . All are electrified at , unlike most of the rest of the network which uses . = HSL 1 = HSL 1 connects Brussels with the French border. long ( dedicated high-speed tracks, modernised lines), it began service on 14 December 1997. The line has appreciably shortened rail journeys, the journey from Paris to Brussels now taking 1:22. In combination with the LGV Nord, it has also impacted international journeys to France and London, ensuring high-speed through-running by Eurostar, TGV, Thalys PBA and Thalys PBKA trainsets. The total construction cost was ‚Ç¨1.42 billion. = HSL 2 = HSL 2 runs between Leuven and Ans. long ( dedicated high-speed tracks, modernised lines) it began service on 15 December 2002. Combined with HSL 3 to the German border, the combined eastward high speed lines have greatly accelerated journeys between Brussels, Paris and Germany. HSL 2 is used by Thalys and ICE trains as well as fast internal InterCity services. = HSL 3 = HSL 3 connects Li√®ge to the German border. long ( dedicated high-speed tracks, modernised lines), it was completed on 15 December 2007, but trains did not start to use it until June 14, 2009. HSL 3 is used by international Thalys and ICE trains only, as opposed to HSL 2 which is also used for fast internal InterCity services. = HSL 4 = HSL 4 connects Antwerp north to the Dutch border where it meets the HSL-Zuid. It is long, comprising dedicated high speed tracks and modernised lines. Mostly completed in 2007, the opening of the line was delayed till December 2009 due to problems with signalling. HSL 4 is used by Thalys trains and fast internal InterCity. Initially, NS Hispeed (now NS International) planned using the newly orderd V250 for the fast Fyra train service between Brussels, Antwerp, Rotterdam and Amsterdam. Due to technical problems with the model, this plan was scrapped. The NS has orderd 20 new ICNG trains for service on this route. Between Brussels and Antwerp (), trains travel at on the upgraded existing line (with the exception of a few segments where a speed limit of is imposed).

There is also a project under way to renovate Mechelen railway station, which involves the construction of tracks at the edge of the station set aside for passing high-speed traffic. When this line is completed, there will be a near-continuous stretch of high- speed line from Brussels to Amsterdam, save for the section between Mechelen and Antwerp. It is not known whether the Belgian government plans to construct a line between Mechelen and Antwerp. There are also areas where the trains cannot run at high speed near the stations: - for trains leaving Brussels, 220 km/h will not be possible until the trains reach Schaarbeek and HSL-4 does not begin until a few kilometres after Antwerp. The track around Rotterdam station has curvatures that are too tight to allow trains to run at full speed and trains run on conventional track between Schiphol and Amsterdam. = EuroCap- Rail = EuroCap-Rail is a proposed high-speed rail axis connecting Brussels, Luxembourg (city), and Strasbourg‚Äîthree cities which, combined, are the homes of six of the seven institutions of the European Union and unofficially called the capitals of Europe.

Construction of the first high-speed rail in Germany began shortly after that of the French LGVs (lignes √† grande vitesse, high-speed lines). However, legal battles caused significant delays, so that the German Intercity-Express (ICE) trains were deployed ten years after the TGV network was established. InterCityExpress The first regularly scheduled ICE trains ran on 2 June 1991 from Hamburg- Altona via Hamburg Hbf ‚Äì Hannover Hbf ‚Äì Kassel-Wilhelmsh√∂he ‚Äì Fulda ‚Äì Frankfurt Hbf ‚Äì Mannheim Hbf and Stuttgart Hbf toward M√ºnchen Hbf on the new ICE line 6. The ICE network is more tightly integrated with pre-existing lines and trains as a result of the different settlement structure in Germany, which has almost twice the population density of France. ICE trains reached destinations in Austria and Switzerland soon after they entered service, taking advantage of the same voltage used in these countries. Starting in 2000, multisystem third-generation ICE trains entered the Netherlands and Belgium. The third generation of the ICE has a service speed of 330 km/h (205 mph) and has reached speeds up to 363 km/h (226 mph). Admission of ICE trains onto French LGVs was applied for in 2001, and trial runs completed in 2005. Since June 2007, ICEs service Paris from Frankfurt and Saarbr√ºcken via the LGV Est. Unlike the Shinkansen in Japan, Germany has experienced a fatal accident on a high-speed service. In the Eschede train disaster of 1998, a first generation ICE experienced catastrophic wheel failure while travelling at 200 km/h near Eschede, following complaints of excessive vibration. Of 287 passengers aboard, 101 people died and 88 were injured in the resulting derailment, which was made worse by the train colliding with a road bridge and causing it to collapse. The accident was the result of faulty wheel design and, following the crash, all ICE wheels of that design were redesigned and replaced. International operators Thalys trains began running in Germany in 1997, from the Belgian HSL 3 to Aachen and Cologne using the Cologne‚ÄìAachen high-speed railway. TGV POS trains began running in Germany in 2007, to Karlsruhe and Stuttgart using the Mannheim‚ÄìStuttgart and Karlsruhe‚ÄìBasel high- speed lines. Swiss SBB high-speed services using the New Pendolino from Frankfurt to Milan on the Karlsruhe‚ÄìBasel line started in 2017. Transrapid Germany has developed the Transrapid, a maglev train system. The Transrapid reaches speeds up to 550 km/h (340 mph). The Emsland test facility, with a total length of , operated in until 2011 when it was closed and in 2012 its demolition was approved. In China, Shanghai Maglev Train, a Transrapid technology based maglev built in collaboration with Siemens, Germany, has been operational since March 2004.

The main service on this route is Flytoget, commuting between Oslo Airport and the metropolitan areas of Oslo at speeds of up to 210 km/h (130 mph). It was extended westwards to include the city of Drammen in 2008, though not at high speed.Airport train bound for Drammen - Aftenposten.no The high-speed section is also used by express and regional trains between Oslo and Eidsvoll. In September 2010, Jernbaneverket awarded several contracts for research into new high-speed routes in Norway. These focus on six routes; five from Oslo to Bergen, Kristiansand/Stavanger, Trondheim, Gothenburg, and Stockholm, plus a sixth coastal route through Bergen, Haugesund and Stavanger. Background Compared to continental European countries, Norway is far more sparsely populated and quite mountainous. On the one hand this causes problems filling up trains, especially compared to other European projects and will give difficulties reaching necessary passenger numbers. On the other hand, Norwegians travel considerably more long-distance than other Europeans, for instance three of Europe's 11 busiest air routes are within Norway. Also, the long-distance road network of Norway has relatively low average speed, making air travel the main long-distance travel option today. The slow roads makes it easier for trains to compete, even though the road network also is being upgraded. For example, a 4-lane motorway will exist from Oslo to Hamar long before the planned double-track railway will. The difficult geography with fjords and mountains has historically meant circuitous routes of both roads and rail lines. Estimates for construction costs have shown that building in Norway is considerably cheaper than on the continent, due to the ability to build tracks straight on bedrock. Also the tunnels usually can be made without sealing (like the many road tunnels) Furthermore, expropriation costs are lower since most of the corridors will go through unpopulated areas. So far, train speed has not been prioritised on long-distance railways in Norway. Oslo-Bergen (526 km) takes about 6:40 in 2007. Oslo-Trondheim (552 km) takes 6:45. These times are about the same as during the last decades, and give an average speed of about 80 km/h. Oslo-Gothenburg is a little faster at 89 km/h, but this is due to Swedish rail quality (112 km/h) rather than Norwegian (72 km/h). As can be seen in the chapter \\"Future plans\\", not much will be built before 2020, and no new track will be operated above 200 km/h in this time. If there is a decision to really build new long-distance high-speed lines it will represent a big change in national transport policy. The situation changed in 2018 after new transportation investment plan.https://www.globalrailwayreview.com/news/68626/norway-nok-120-billion- rail-projects/ It is claimed that additional 270 km of high-speed lines will be built until 2029. Plans In Norway there are plans to build a few 200 km/h railways in near future. This limit of 200 km/h might be raised slightly in the future on certain straight parts of track. There is a decision from around 2012 of trying to allow 250 km/h on new projects, because an EU directive mandates this on new mainlines. *Between Oslo‚ÄìSki a new tunnel will be built, partly suitable for 250 km/h (to be finished around 2021). *A new high-speed track for Vestfoldbanen, Drammen‚ÄìT√∏nsberg is to be finished around 2024. A new railway is being built between Holm and Nykirke allowing 250 km/h is due to open in November 2016, almost all in tunnel. It will be the first railroad section that allows 250 km/h and includes a new Holmestrand station. A new railway is being built between Larvik and Porsgrunn allowing 250 km/h is due to open in 2018, mostly in tunnel. The rest of the railway Drammen‚ÄìSkien will be upgraded. A new railway will be built between Porsgrunn and the S√∏rlandet Line around Ris√∏r, mostly in tunnel. No decided time schedule. *The new track Eidsvoll‚ÄìHamar on the Dovre Line is expected to be finished around 2024, with 200 km/h most of the track. A new railway built between Langset and Kleverud allowing 200 km/h was opened in December 2015. *A new track Ringeriksbanen Oslo‚ÄìH√∏nefoss, mostly in a tunnel, will cut travel time between those two cities with up to one hour (indicated time gains depend on political prioritisations.) No decided time plan. *In about 1995 a new double track Ski-Moss was constructed, which is straight enough for 200 km/h for most of the route. However, only 160 km/h is permitted on this stretch (with an average speed of just 105 km/h). The route can easily be upgraded. =Long-term plans= There is also a political climate for building more high-speed railway services in Norway. The Norwegian National Railway Administration, Jernbaneverket, has paid for an analysis on the possibilities for building high-speed railway services in Norway. The VWI Stuttgart (Institute of Transportation Research at the University of Stuttgart, Germany) has done this analysis. The conclusions indicate that the most interesting corridors are Oslo-Gothenburg (in Sweden) and Oslo-Trondheim (through the √òsterdalen valley).http://www.norskbane.no/nb/AbstractVWI.pdf The Oslo-Bergen corridor could expect the highest passenger count, but is much more expensive to build. According to the report, the lines are assumed to be single-track railways, with up to 4% grade, dedicated to high-speed passenger trains with a 250 km/h (155 mph) maximum cruise speed. Closer to the big cities, the railways would be double-track and also be used for regional trains. The feasibility study has suggested that a passenger count of 5000 per day per line could be expected if rail is competitive with air travel. This is much lower than German or French high-speed lines, and building double tracks will not be economical. It will, however, be hard to get below three hours from Oslo to Bergen or Trondheim on single track, as meeting trains will be very sensitive to delays. Travel time above three hours makes it hard to compete with air travel. There is no single-track high-speed railway in operation in the world at the moment (one such, the Botniabanan in Sweden is built for 250 km/h, but does not operate above 200). The VWI investigation suggests very long passing loops (15 km) to be able to pass at 160 km/h, and accept some delays without delaying meeting trains. Since these railways would be high- speed only, the passing loops need only to be 30 minutes travel time (80‚Äì100 km) apart (assuming one train per hour per direction). Though the initiative to the analysis itself is an evidence of a promising political climate for high-speed railways, the analysis has been heavily criticized for not being done by a recognised competence in this area, for being based on inaccurate facts, and for using gross miscalculations of important data, like potential passenger numbers and potential costs of building new high-speed tracks. Mainly these criticisms are from lobbyist organisations which prefer railways to Bergen and √Ölesund, which has been seen as too expensive by VWI. Especially the recommendation by WVI to use √òsterdalen (with very sparse population) and only one stop there has been criticised. The Red-green coalition government did, with support from the Progress party and the Conservative Party, declare in 2013 that there will be no high-speed railways outside the regional network around Oslo until at least year 2030. They claim it is a waste of money.Vraker lyntog-planer (in Norwegian) Their opinion became opposite after new plans approved in 2018, government decided to spend more to transportation as a reaction to the same decisions abroad. = Suggestions for high-speed railway networks = There are also several independent initiatives for high-speed railways in Norway: * Norsk Bane is an initiative for a high-speed railway network that will cover large parts of Southern Norway. It is backed by local organisations like municipalities. It has several lines that can be considered independently, but at its greatest extent it will include the major cities of Bergen, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Trondheim and √Ölesund with a hub in Oslo. In addition there will also be a line through the Vestfold region and lines both west and east of the Mj√∏sa lake. This project will however need political support before it can be started. Norsk Bane has criticised the VWI investigation mainly because it did not prioritise railways to Hordaland and M√∏re og Romsdal. Norsk Bane has been criticised because they assume 250 km/h average speed (between stops) at 250 km/h cruise speed and assuming 2:30 travel time Oslo-Trondheim including seven stops (490 km). This is not possible even on a double track railway. * Den s√∏rnorske h√∏yhastighetsringen is a political initiative for building a high-speed railway ring that will include the major cities Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger and Kristiansand, in addition to the densely populated Vestfold region. This proposal wants to use the existing corridors of Bergensbanen and along the south coast. This is also a lobbyist organisation backed by local forces.

In February 2009, the government of Portugal announced plans to build a high-speed rail line from Lisbon to Madrid; this plan was cancelled in March 2012 amidst a bailout programme of financial assistance to the Portuguese Republic. The project was valued at ‚Ç¨7.8 billion and the government had claimed it would create 100,000 jobs.\\"Portugal to press on with Madrid-Lisbon high-speed train link\\", by Elisabete Tavares, The Guardian/Reuters, 6 Feb. 2009 The line would link to Spain's Southwest Corridor. Current operations Since the late 1990s Comboios de Portugal (CP) has run the Alfa Pendular service, connecting Portugal's mainland from the north border to the Algarve at a speed of up to (in specific sections), which reduced the travel time between Porto and Lisbon by approximately 30 minutes. The service is operated using 10 Italian-designed Pendolino tilting trains. Based on the Italian ETR 480, trains were assembled in Portugal at the former SOREFAME/Adtranz plant in Amadora. Fiat Ferroviaria was the main contractor, with Siemens AG and ADtranz as subcontractors. In addition to these high-speed trains, CP InterCity \\"corail\\" coaches have been upgraded to running. These are hauled by CP 5600 locomotives (identical to the Spanish RENFE Class 252).http://www.railfaneurope.net/list/portugal/portugal_cp-uvir.html These \\"corail\\" coaches are based on French SNCF Corail cars but their carbody is made out of stainless steel, manufactured at the SOREFAME plant. Current infrastructure The Northern Line was modernised to allow trains to run at 220 km/h between Lisbon-Alverca, Vila Franca de Xira‚ÄìSantar√©m, Pombal‚ÄìAlfarelos and Mealhada‚ÄìEspinho, and to allow full use of the tilting to achieve speeds between 140‚Äì180 km/h in the remaining intermediate sections. Work is underway to continue to bring these intermediate stretches up to standards. The Southern Line was modernised to allow trains to run at 220 km/h between Lisbon-Pinhal Novo and Gr√¢ndola‚ÄìFuncheira; work is underway in a new variant between Pinhal Novo-Grandola to allow seamless 220 km/h running all the way from Lisboa to Funcheira (150 km). Alfa Pendular trains with their top speed of 220 km/h are in fact the only reason the top speed is 220 km/h. The tilting trains run in most slower sections at 20/40 km/h above conventional trains speeds. On high speed sections conventional trains run at 200 km/h and Tilting trains at their 220 km/h top speed. The true speed limit on these long sections is well above 220 km/h. In February 2011, trains began using the Alc√°cer Bypass, cutting 6.7 km of the Southern Line through means of a 29 km line that includes a bridge across the Sado River. Trains will be able to travel at 200 km along the section, or 220 km with tilting technology. The new bypass will cut 10m from the journey times of trains traveling south from Lisbon towards the Algarve.http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single- view/view/alcacer-cut-off-opens.html Trains run hourly between Lisbon and Porto, most being Alfa Pendular (2 stops at Coimbra and Aveiro), other Alfa Pendular and some InterCity (which loco hauled 200 km/h trains with 5/14 cars) call at 6 to 9 intermediate stops. Additionally some Alfa Pendular and Intercity trains run north to Guimar√£es and Braga and others go down the south line to service Faro, which is served by two Porto - Lisboa - Faro Alfa Pendulars and three Lisbon - Faro InterCity (limited to 160 km/h due to the refurbished Sorefame coaches used on the route). Previous plans for high- speed rail In 2005 the Portuguese government had approved the construction of three high-speed lines: * from the capital Lisbon to Porto (300 km/h new HSL expected to be finished in 2015). The two biggest cities of Portugal would be at a distance of a 1h15 train trip. * from (350 km/h mixed traffic HSL expected to be complete by 2013Alta Velocidade em S√≠ntese ) bringing the countries' capital cities within three hours of each other (less than 2h45 expected). * from Porto to Vigo (250 km/h mixed traffic new line between Braga and the border) which would connect both extremes (Porto and Vigo) in less than 45 minutes, would link to . On December 12, 2009, the Portuguese Ministry of Public Work, Transport and Communications announced the ELOS consortium was awarded a 40-year contract to build, finance and maintain the first 165 km section of the high speed line from Poceir√£o to the Spanish border, Caia. The route's length is 165 km. The PPP contract was formally signed on 8 May 2010 and included construction of a broad-gauge freight track between Evora and Caia. Completion was expected by the end of 2013. However, with the Great Recession, and the resulting European sovereign-debt crisis, major public works projects in Portugal were frozen to reduce the amount of public debt. In this context the later elected (2011) Portuguese government withdrew the high- speed railway plans in favour of a plan to develop standard-gauge freight routes to the rest of Europe. After a court battle with the ELOS consortium the high speed rail project was terminated by the Portuguese government.

The Conservative government of Edward Heath, elected at the 1970 general election, had previously abolished the Prices and Incomes Board in November 1970, shortly after taking power, relying on competition to keep prices down. At the same time, the Industrial Relations Act 1971 was intended to rein in the trades unions. The Conservatives' economic policy was not successful, and the government took a U-turn. A 90-day freeze of pay and prices (as well as rents and dividends) was introduced on 6 November 1972 under the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972. This was replaced by a Price and Pay Code, which strictly limited increases, supervised by a new Price Commission and a Pay Board. The Conservatives were unable to keep power after the inconclusive February 1974 UK general election, and the Pay Board was abolished in July 1974 by the minority Labour government led by Harold Wilson, but the Price Commission continued.

She went by the name of 'Tanya' and performed the ballad \\"I colori della felicit√†\\". Adopting the stage name Lara Saint Paul, she performed in the 1966 Festival delle Rose with the song Il pieno and was a finalist in the 1967 Festival della Canzone Napoletana for her performance of Te faie desidera'. Her first big success arrived when she returned to the Sanremo Music Festival in 1968 as one of the two performers of the song Mi va di cantare. The other performer was Louis Armstrong, and they performed alongside Lionel Hampton. She also participated in Sanremo in 1972 with Se non-fosse tra queste mie braccia lo inventerei and in 1973 with Una casa grande. She was a finalist three times in the Sanremo Music Festival. In 1988, Lara Saint Paul was a producer and conductor for the Sanremo Music Festival at the Casin√≤ di Sanremo. Music Lara Saint Paul has worked with many notable talents in the music industry. Her songs Non preoccuparti and Adesso ricomincerei were produced and arranged by American producer Quincy Jones and recorded by an orchestra of Italian musicians, including Pino Presti on electric bass, Angel Pocho Gatti and Victor Bacchetta at the piano, and Tullio De Piscopo on drums, in 1973. In the same year she released an Italian cover version of Killing Me Softly with His Song, originally composed by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel, titled Mi fa morir cantando. Lara Saint Paul has worked and performed with notables such as Ray Charles, Lionel Hampton, Louis Armstrong, Roberta Flack, Frank Sinatra and Stevie Wonder.

A succession of major work projects, institution establishments and direct involvement in world enterprise accelerated the settlement's development. Significant events in the history of Cairns were the construction of the Cairns-to-Herberton railway line commencing in 1886, the establishment of the Cairns Harbour Board in 1906, official recognition as a city in 1923, military occupation in 1942 by the World War II defence forces, the construction of concrete high rise apartments in 1981, the opening of the international airport in 1984, and the establishment of an international-standard convention centre in 1996. Prior to Cairns settlement =Original inhabitants= The Aboriginal population is believed to have entered Australia at least 60,000 years ago. Current opinion favours migration through various parts of northern Australia including Cape York Peninsula. Traditional local Aboriginal stories recall hunting and fishing on land that once extended past Green Island during a time of lower sea levels. Archaeological evidence shows Aboriginal peoples living in rainforest in the Cairns area for at least 5,100 years, and possibly for much of the often suggested 40,000-year period. (Quoting Nicky Horsfall) The first recorded human occupants of the Cairns area were Australian Aboriginal peoples. Tribal groups speaking the Gimuy Walubara Yidinji language were generally on the south side of the Barron River. On the northern side, particularly in the coastal area from the Barron to Port Douglas, Yirrganydji groups generally spoke dialects of the Djabugay language. Yidinji (also known as Yidinj, Yidiny, and Idindji) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is within the local government areas of Cairns Region and Tablelands Region, in such localities as Cairns, Gordonvale, the southern part of the Atherton Tableland including Atherton and Kairi. The area is known in the local Yidiny language as Gimuy. =James Cook= On 10 June 1770, English maritime explorer Lieutenant James Cook visited and gave a European name to the inlet. In his journal, he commented, \\"The shore between Cape Grafton and Cape Tribulation forms a large but not very deep bay which I named Trinity Bay after the day ‚Äì Trinity Sunday ‚Äì on which it was discovered.\\" Cook hauled his ship, the HM Bark Endeavour into Mission Bay, at the southern end of Trinity inlet between Cape Grafton and False Cape, and went ashore for a short time with Sir Joseph Banks near the present site of the Yarrabah Aboriginal community. =Phillip Parker King= Lieutenant Phillip Parker King, one of the most important early charters of Australia's coast, made three marine surveying expeditions to northern Australia in 1819, 1820, and 1821. All three expeditions included visits to Fitzroy Island, located about from Cairns. On King's first visit, he drew attention to the availability of drinking water and the presence of Aboriginal people in the area. =Owen Stanley= In June 1848, Captain Owen Stanley undertook a ten- day hydrographic depth sounding survey of the Trinity Bay region. His consequent official map listed \\"Native Huts\\" at present-day Palm Cove, and \\"Many Natives\\" and \\"Native Village\\" on the stretch of coast immediately north. Green Island was marked \\"Low Bushes\\", and the future site of Cairns was indicated as \\"Shoal\\" and \\"Mangroves\\". Settlement =Assessment of site= The first historical event of significance leading up to the establishment of Cairns was an essay published in a Sydney newspaper in 1866. The article, by J. S. V. Mein, a ships commander appointed to set up a b√™che-de-mer plant at Green Island,Sydney Morning Herald 26 February 1866, Mein family documents p1 Cairns Historical Society helped increase southern awareness of the northern location. 1874 map showing native wells situated within the future site of Cairns With the arrival of the beche de mer fishermen from the late 1860s came the first semi-permanent British presence in the area. On the site of the modern-day Cairns foreshore, there was a large native well which was used by these fishermen. A violent confrontation occurred in 1872 between local Yidinji people and Phillip Garland, a beche de mer fisherman, over the use of this well. The area from this date was subsequently called Battle Camp. In 1872, William Hann led a prospecting expedition in the Palmer River, where an extensive gold field was located. Announcement of this location in September 1873 by James Venture Mulligan resulted in an influx of prospectors, which became the basis for the first large non-indigenous populations to inhabit Far North Queensland.Discoverers of the Palmer River Gold Fields Petition Qld Votes and Proceedings 1874 Vol 2 p755 In 1873, the extensive and detailed reports of the George Dalrymple exploration party indicated the assets and potential of Trinity Inlet: Dalrymple also noted the number of Aboriginal groups in the area: \\"Many blacks were seen round the shores of the bay. Blacks camp fires burn brightly during the night in glens of the mountain sides.\\"George Dalrymple, Narrative and Report of the North Coast Expedition 1873 p630 / 632 In March 1876, three years after the Palmer River discovery, James Mulligan announced that an even larger and more extensive gold field had been found at the Hodgkinson River on the Atherton Tableland, west of Trinity Inlet.Warners expedition notes published Brisbane Courier 14 April 1876 This site was of sufficient size to warrant serious consideration to the building of a track to the coast, and the establishment of a coastal wharf and settlement to export the mineral. Sub-Inspector Alexander Douglas-Douglas of the Native Police led a party to cut an access track in three days, from the tableland to the coast through of thick lawyer vine scrub. He met up with another Sub-Inspector in Robert Arthur Johnstone who was proceeding from the coast and the track was completed on 23 September 1876. It was later named the Douglas Track.Jones, Dorothy Trinity Phoenix p 69 =Official settlement= Around the same time, another group led by prospector William \\"Bill\\" Smith travelling from the Hodgkinson goldfields, cut an alternate route to the coast at Trinity Inlet. This was called Smith's Track and the place on the inlet where it finished was called Smith's Landing. Closer investigation by several official expeditions to Trinity Inlet established its potential for development into a port. Brinsley G. Sheridan, a police magistrate from Cardwell, surveyed the area around Smith's Landing and planned a settlement which he called Thornton. However, the coastal site of Battle Camp where the more direct Douglas Track finished became the preferable place of settlement. The first government officials arrived by boat and pitched their tents opposite the site of the present-day Pacific International hotel.Cairns Post Cairns Jubilee Special Issue 1 November 1876 p18 On 7 October 1876, the Governor of Queensland, William Wellington Cairns, proclaimed the new northern port at Trinity Bay which was named Cairns in his honour.Cairns Post Cairns Jubilee Special Issue 1 November 1876 p4 On 1 November 1876, the township was inaugurated at a luncheon given by Captain T.

The area is roughly bounded by Rodheath, Stoneygate Road, Roman Road, and Beechwood Road to the north, Hatters Way to the south, the M1 to the west, and Waller Avenue and Chaul End Lane to the east. History Challney was originally just another name for Chaul End up on the hill to the south of the district.This is stated in a deed of sale of rectoral tithes dated 1599 (H. Cobbe, Luton Church: Historical and Descriptive, George Bell, 1899, page 45). Medieval forms of the name included Chalveleye, Challe, Challeye and Chaleie (S. Coleman, Caddington and Kensworth, Bedfordshire County Council (Bedfordshire Parish Surveys, Historic Landscape and Archaeology, 4), 1985, , page 63). Why would the name of Chaul End be used for a district of Luton? One link is that some of the Chaul End land, such as Badgerdell Wood, was originally in the parish of Luton (Cobbe, pages 43 and 599). Another link is that the part of Challney ward to the south of Dunstable Road was in Chaul End Field, and in the parish of Caddington before it was transferred to Luton in 1928, 1934 and 1964 (Coleman, page 11 and map 2).

He was a son of the Champion sire Sir Gallahad III, and his damsire was U.S. Horse of the Year Reigh Count, who won the 1928 Kentucky Derby. Owned by Ethel V. Mars' Milky Way Farm Stable, named for her company's famous chocolate bar brand, Gallahadion raced at age three in California. Although he was unplaced in the Santa Anita Derby and the San Juan Capistrano Handicap, after winning the 1940 San Vicente Stakes and finishing second in the Derby Trial, Gallahadion was entered in the Kentucky Derby. Triple Crown races In the 1940 Kentucky Derby, Edward R. Bradley's colt Bimelech, the 1939 U.S. 2-Year-Old Champion, was the overwhelming favorite, bet down to 40¬¢ on the dollar. Mioland, owned by Charles S. Howard of Seabiscuit fame, was a very distant second choice at more than 6:1 odds. Given almost no chance, Gallahadion was sent off as a 36:1 longshot but under jockey Carroll Bierman scored an upset over Bimelech. For owner Ethel V. Mars, whom the May 9, 1940 Centralia Illinois Evening Sentinel reported had spent more than $500,000 buying horses since 1935 with the eye to winning the Derby. Gallahadion was her eighth horse to run in the Derby in the past six years. Previously, Mrs. Mars' best results came in 1935 and 1937 when her horses finished third. A severe cold kept her at home and she was not at Churchill Downs to see her horse capture the one race she had wanted to win most of all. In the second and third legs of the U.S. Triple Crown, Bimelech won both races. Gallahadion finished third in the Preakness Stakes, then found the extra distance in the 1¬Ω mile Belmont Stakes too much and was unplaced. During the remainder of 1940, Gallahadion met with little success, as he did the following year when he raced at age four.

His work on the Merchant Shipbuilding Advisory Committee and on the Admiralty Shipbuilding Council was recognized officially in June 1921, when he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, this following the CBE that he had been awarded three years previously. He served two terms as President of the North-East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders, and was a director of Messrs. Ruston-Bucyrus Ltd, specialists in excavating machinery which incorporated the old established firms of Ruston and Hornsby Ltd. of Lincoln and the Bucyrus-Erie Co. of South Milwaukee USA.

The area is roughly bounded by Telscombe Way and Someries Hill to the north, Wigmore Park to the south, Buckingham Drive and Wigmore Lane to the west, and the edge of Luton to the east. History Before being engulfed by Luton, Wigmore was a small hamlet with few scattered residential houses. It was centred on Wigmore Hall, a farmhouse built in the early 19th century, which still stands at 66 Eaton Green Road. It was not until the 1970s when extensive development began, consisting mostly of suburban low-density residential housing. The 1980s saw further development, as the estate now stretches from the original eastern edge of Luton to the county border. Local Area Wigmore Lane, the main road through the area, is the home to Luton's only Asda supermarket, the Wigmore Place retail area, the Wigmore House offices and a number smaller chain stores and independent shops. Wigmore Hall now houses the Active Luton headquarters. The area is also home to Wigmore Primary School.  London Luton Airport  Wigmore is notable for its proximity to London Luton Airport, one of the busiest airports in the United Kingdom. Despite being located directly next to the airport, Wigmore suffers from little aircraft noise due to not being on the flight path and the nearby green space Wigmore Park acting as a buffer zone. London Luton Airport's growth in recent years spawned proposals to purchase and demolish homes in southern Wigmore to construct a second runway north of the current one. However, the Airport authority withdrew this plan in favour of one to develop without the need for an additional or extended runway.  Politics  Wigmore is part of the much larger Wigmore ward, which also includes parts of Vauxhall Park, Napier Park, Ramridge End, and Putteridge. The ward represented by Cllr Peter Chapman (Liberal Democrats), Cllr Diane Moles (Liberal Democrats) and Cllr Alan Skepelhorn (Liberal Democrats). The ward forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Luton South, and the MP is Gavin Shuker (Change UK). Wigmore is situated within the East of England (European Parliament constituency).

Early life Takeyama was born in Osaka, but moved frequently as his father, a bank employee, was often transferred. From 1907-1913, he lived in Gyeongseong (modern Seoul), Korea, then under Japanese rule. After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University's Department of German Literature, he was sent by Ministry of Education to Europe, where he studied for three years in Paris and Berlin. Literary career On returning home in 1932, Takeyama taught German language as a professor at First Higher School, and also translated works of German literature into Japanese. Among the works he translated were Goethe's An Anthology, Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra and Out of My Life and Thought: An Autobiography by Albert Schweitzer. However, despite his close connections with Germany, he was very leery of the Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and published an editorial called Doitsu, atarashiki ch≈´sei? ('Germany, the medieval age refurbished?'), in which he was critical of foreign totalitarianism. In 1944, Takeyama relocated to Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture after his home in Tokyo was destroyed in the air raids. He lived in Kamakura until his death in 1984. After World War II, Takeyama became famous for his novel, Biruma no Tategoto (\\"Harp of Burma\\"), which was serialized in Akatonbo ('The Red Dragonfly'), a literary magazine aimed primarily at children, over 1947-1948, before being published in book format in October 1948. An award- winning novel, it was subsequently translated into English under UNESCO sponsorship, and made into a well-known 1956 movie. In 1948, he wrote Scars, set in northern China, which Takeyama had visited in 1931 and 1938. In 1950, during the height of the popularity of socialism in Japanese politics, Takeyama again spoke out, this time against Stalinism, and warned that totalitarianism can come from the left end of the political spectrum, as well as the right. In 1951, Takeyama resigned his teaching position in favor of literary criticism, publishing Sh≈çwa no Seishin-shi (\\"A Psychological History of the Sh≈çwa period\\") and Ningen ni Tsuite (\\"On Human Beings\\"); however, throughout his career, Takeyama had a very diverse range of interests. In 1959, Takeyama created a literary magazine, Jiyu (\\"Freedom\\"), together with fellow novelist Hirabayashi Taiko. He also started to write travelogues. His works Koto Henreki: Nara (Pilgrimage to the ancient capital, Nara), and Nihonjin to Bi (The Japanese and Beauty) combine his broad and deep understanding of the classic arts of Japan and his sensitivity to European literature. He also wrote Yoroppa no Tabi (\\"Travels in Europe\\") and Maboroshi to Shinjitsu: Watashi no Sobieto Kembun (\\"Fantasy and Truth: My Observations of the Soviet Union\\"), in which he analyzed Western civilization and his perception of the failure of the communist system in the Soviet Union. Takeyama became a member of the Japan Art Academy in 1983, and in the same year he was awarded the Kikuchi Kan Prize for an anthology of eight of his most notable works. He died in 1984, and his grave is at the Kamakura Reien Cemetery.

After sufficient testimony regarding the issue is presented to the host and her panel, the audience is then welcome to give additional feedback to each party as well. At the end of each segment, the \\"Archis\\" hand down their opinion on the case based on whose side they believe holds the stronger argument, followed by the audience doing the same. The host then concludes with her own opinion on the issue and gives final advice to the feuding participants. =Los Archis= During these cases, the host is assisted by a panel of three observers known as \\"Los Archis\\" (which is short for either \\"Los Archiamigos\\" or \\"Los Archienemigos\\", Spanish terms best translated within the show's context as \\"The Arch-allies\\" or \\"The Arch- objectors\\", depending on whose side of the dispute the panel is leaning towards), who question the parties and can provide advocacy to their situation. Past Archis included Rafael Mercadante and Paula Arcila.

Heinrich Luden. Heinrich Luden (10 April 1778 - 23 May 1847) was a German historian. Luden was born in Loxstedt in the district of Stade. At the age of 17 Luden went to the Domschule (Cathedral School) in Bremen. He subsequently studied theology at the University of G√∂ttingen, where he came under the influence of the historians August Ludwig von Schl√∂zer and later Johannes von M√ºller and devoted himself to the study of history. He was briefly employed as a private tutor in the house of Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland in Berlin, in 1805 producing his thesis in Jena on Christian Thomasius. He further published biographies of Hugo Grotius (1806) and Sir William Temple (1808). In 1806 Luden succeeded Friedrich Schiller as Extraordinary Professor of History at the University of Jena, in 1810 attaining the post of Ordinary Professor. He dedicated himself to German history, with the intention of developing a German national consciousness. He continued this theme in subsequent numerous publication on the theme of unity and freedom. In his lectures, much attended by the Burschenschaften (student associations) he championed the ideal of the sovereignty of the people, showing the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1817, with certain other professors, including the medic Dietrich Georg von Kieser and the philosophers Lorenz Oken and Jakob Friedrich Fries he participated in the Wartburg festival. In 1820 Luden entered the Landst√§nde of the Grand Duchy of Saxony-Weimar-Eisenach as a deputy and remained one of its most active members until 1832. Following the Karlsbad Decrees Luden was forbidden from lecturing on political subjects. Among his students were the assassin Karl Ludwig Sand and the K√∂nigsberg historian Johannes Voigt.

The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment. While his paintings were recognized as exceptional by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery in London since 1863 and is regarded as a masterpiece of British art. The painting depicts a natural philosopher, a forerunner of the modern scientist, recreating one of Robert Boyle's air pump experiments, in which a bird is deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers. The group exhibits a variety of reactions, but for most of the audience scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird. The central figure looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome. Historical background Title page of Robert Boyle's New Experiments of 1660, in which he detailed how to perform the experiment. In 1659, Robert Boyle commissioned the construction of an air pump, then described as a \\"pneumatic engine\\", which is known today as a \\"vacuum pump\\". The air pump was invented by Otto von Guericke in 1650, though its high cost deterred most contemporary scientists from constructing the apparatus. Boyle, the son of the Earl of Cork, had no such concerns‚Äîafter its construction, he donated the initial 1659 model to the Royal Society and had a further two redesigned machines built for his personal use. Aside from Boyle's three pumps, there were probably no more than four others in existence during the 1660s: Christian Huygens had one in The Hague, Henry Power may have had one at Halifax, and there may have been pumps at Christ's College, Cambridge, and the Montmor Academy in Paris.Shapin 1984, pp. 481‚Äì520. Boyle's pump, which was largely designed to Boyle's specifications and constructed by Robert Hooke, was complicated, temperamental, and problematic to operate. Many demonstrations could only be performed with Hooke on hand, and Boyle frequently left critical public displays solely to Hooke‚Äîwhose dramatic flair matched his technical skill.Jardine 2004, pp. 104‚Äì106. Despite the operational and maintenance obstacles, construction of the pump enabled Boyle to conduct a great many experiments on the properties of air, which he later detailed in his New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects, (Made, for the Most Part, in a New Pneumatical Engine). In the book, he described in great detail 43 experiments he conducted, on occasion assisted by Hooke, on the effect of air on various phenomena. Boyle tested the effects of \\"rarified\\" air on combustion, magnetism, sound, and barometers, and examined the effects of increased air pressure on various substances. He listed two experiments on living creatures: \\"Experiment 40\\", which tested the ability of insects to fly under reduced air pressure, and the dramatic \\"Experiment 41,\\" which demonstrated the reliance of living creatures on air for their survival. In this attempt to discover something \\"about the account upon which Respiration is so necessary to the Animals, that Nature hath furnish'd with Lungs\\", Boyle conducted numerous trials during which he placed a large variety of different creatures, including birds, mice, eels, snails and flies, in the vessel of the pump and studied their reactions as the air was removed.West 2005, pp. 31‚Äì39. Here, he describes an injured lark: By the time Wright painted his picture in 1768, air pumps were a relatively commonplace scientific instrument, and itinerant \\"lecturers in natural philosophy\\"‚Äîusually more showmen than scientists‚Äîoften performed the \\"animal in the air pump experiment\\" as the centrepiece of their public demonstration.Elliott 2000, pp. 61‚Äì100. These were performed in town halls and other large buildings for a ticket-buying audience, or were booked by societies or for private showings in the homes of the well-off, the setting suggested in both of Wright's demonstration pieces.Egerton, 1998, pp. 337‚Äì38. One of the most notable and respectable of the travelling lecturers was James Ferguson FRS, a Scottish astronomer and probable acquaintance of Joseph Wright (both were friends of John Whitehurst). Ferguson noted that a \\"lungs-glass\\" with a small air-filled bladder inside was often used in place of the animal, as using a living creature was \\"too shocking to every spectator who has the least degree of humanity\\".Baird 2003. The full moon in the picture is significant as meetings of the Lunar Circle (renamed the Lunar Society by 1775) were timed to make use of its light when travelling. Wright met Erasmus Darwin in the early 1760s, probably through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when he stayed in the Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, it is more likely that this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar Circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle. Painting =Background= Candlelit scene by Godfried Schalcken During his apprenticeship and early career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, he was an accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright was influenced by the work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.Nicolson 1968, p. 39. Wright's An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump forms part of a series of candlelit nocturnes that he produced between 1765 and 1768. There was a long history of painting candlelit scenes in Western art, although as Wright had not at this date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might have seen in the original, as opposed to prints. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century Utrecht Caravaggisti, thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the Leiden fijnschilder Godfried Schalcken (1643‚Äì1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.Egerton (1998), pp. 334‚Äì335, and Nicolson (1968), pp. 39‚Äì40 and 47. Waterhouse (1978), p. 285, says Wright \\"must have seen some works by Honthorst or Schalken\\". Although he was the leading expert writing in English, Nicolson does not suggest that Wright is likely to have known of the 17th-century candlelit narrative religious subjects of Georges de La Tour and Trophime Bigot, which, in their seriousness, are the closest works to Wright that are lit only by candle. The Dutch painters' works and other candlelit scenes by 18th-century English painters such as Henry Morland (father of George) tended instead to exploit the possibilities of semi-darkness for erotic suggestiveness. Some of Wright's own later candlelit scenes were by no means as serious as his first ones, as seen from their titles: Two Boys Fighting Over a Bladder and Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight.Egerton (1998), p. 336. Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight (1765) A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery (1768) The first of his candlelit masterpieces, Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight, was painted in 1765, and showed three men studying a small copy of the \\"Borghese Gladiator\\". Viewing the Gladiator was greatly admired; but his next painting, A Philosopher giving that Lecture on the Orrery, in which a Lamp is put in place of the Sun (normally known by the shortened form A Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrery or just The Orrery), caused a greater stir, as it replaced the Classical subject at the centre of the scene with one of a scientific nature. Wright's depiction of the awe produced by scientific \\"miracles\\" marked a break with traditions in which the artistic depiction of such wonder was reserved for religious events,Brooke 1991, p. 178. since to Wright the marvels of the technological age were as awe-inspiring as the subjects of the great religious paintings.Nicolson 1968, p. 40. In both of these works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe.Guilding, p. 83. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were an essential part of the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Am√©d√©e-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.Egerton, 1998, 342. The painting was one of a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French- dictated hierarchy of genres in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated as seriously as the costumed history painting of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the Orrery and Air Pump subjects resembled conversation pieces, then largely a form of middle- class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when Johann Zoffany began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces.Waterhouse (1978), pp. 215‚Äì216, 270, 285‚Äì286. The 20th-century art historian Ellis Waterhouse compares these two works to the \\"genre serieux\\" of contemporary French drama, as defined by Denis Diderot and Pierre Beaumarchais, a view endorsed by Egerton.Waterhouse (1978), pp. 285‚Äì286, and Egerton (1998), p. 334. An anonymous review from the time called Wright \\"a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way\\".Solkin 1994, p. 234. The Orrery was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers, an amateur astronomer who had an orrery of his own, and with whom Wright's friend Peter Perez Burdett was staying while in Derbyshire. Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with his son next to the orrery. Ferrers purchased the painting for ¬£210, but the 6th Earl auctioned it off, and it is now held by Derby Museum and Art Gallery.Uglow 2002, p. 123. =Detail= Detail from the painting An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump followed in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94¬Ω inches (183 by 244 cm), shows a grey cockatiel fluttering in panic as the air is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: one of the girls worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers to the left of the painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatiel saved.Jones 2003. Aside from that of the children, little sympathy is directed toward the bird; David Solkin suggests the subjects of the painting show the dispassionate detachment of the evolving scientific society. Individuals are concerned for each other: the father for his children, the young man for the girl, but the distress of the cockatiel elicits only careful study.Solkin 1994, p. 247. To one side of the boy at the rear, the cockatiel's empty cage can be seen on the wall, and to further heighten the drama it is unclear whether the boy is lowering the cage on the pulley to allow the bird to be replaced after the experiment or hoisting the cage back up, certain of its former occupant's death. It has also been suggested that he may be drawing the curtains to block out the light from the full moon. An earlier oil sketch showed the demonstrator in a more reassuring pose. The bird here was a common songbird.The sketch extends somewhat further to the right than shown here. The full image is reproduced in Egerton (1998), p. 339. Jenny Uglow believes that the boy echoes the figure in the last print of William Hogarth's The Four Stages of Cruelty by pointing out the arrogance and potential cruelty of experimentation, while David Fraser also sees the compositional similarities with the audience grouped round a central demonstration.Fraser in Egerton 1990, p. 19. The neutral stance of the central character and the uncertain intentions of the boy with the cage were both later ideas: an early study, discovered on the back of a self-portrait, omits the boy and shows the natural philosopher reassuring the girls. In this sketch it is obvious that the bird will survive, and thus the composition lacks the power of the final version.Nicolson 1968, p. 45. Wright, who took many of his subjects from English poetry, probably knew the following passage from \\"The Wanderer\\" (1729) by Richard Savage:Egerton 1998, p. 339. > :So in some Engine, that denies a Vent, :If unrespiring is some Creature > pent, :It sickens, droops, and pants, and gasps for Breath, :Sad o'er the > Sight swim shad'wy Mists of Death; :If then kind Air pours powerful in > again. :New Heats, new Pulses quicken ev'ry Vein; :From the clear'd, lifted, > life-rekindled Eye, :Dispers'd, the dark and dampy Vapours fly. Trinities. The cockatiel would have been a rare bird at the time, \\"and one whose life would never in reality have been risked in an experiment such as this\\".Egerton 1998, p. 340. It did not become well known until after it was shown in illustrations to the accounts of the voyages of Captain Cook in the 1770s. Prior to Cook's voyage, cockatiels had been imported only in small numbers as exotic cage-birds. Wright had painted one in 1762 at the home of William Chase, featuring it both in his portrait of Chase and his wife (Mr & Mrs William Chase) and a separate study, The Parrot.Egerton 1990, pp. 58‚Äì61. In selecting such a rarity for this scientific sacrifice, Wright not only chose a more dramatic subject than the \\"lungs-glass\\", but was perhaps making a statement about the values of society in the Age of Enlightenment. The grey plumage of the cockatiel also shows much more effectively in the darkened room than the small dull-coloured bird in Wright's early oil sketch. A resemblance has been pointed out between the group of the bird and the two nearest figures and a type of depiction of the Trinity found in Early Netherlandish painting, where the Holy Spirit is represented by a dove, to which God the Father (the philosopher) points, while Christ (the father) gestures in blessing to the viewer.First mentioned in Busch 1986, in the chapter \\"Wright und sein Rekurs auf die christliche Bildtradition,\\" pp. 29‚Äì49; Egerton 1998, p. 340. On the table are various other pieces of equipment that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, and close to the man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time.Nicolson 1968, p. 114. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment;Alternatives for the object in the bowl have been suggested, including lungs (which would be relevant to demonstrations of the properties of air), and Hockney suggests it may even be a ball of sulphur which is creating the illumination for the scene as it reacts with the liquid. William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas‚Äîthe two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatiel's struggle for life. =Style= Frye's mezzotint figures (left) are thought to have inspired those of Wright (right). Frye's chalk drawing (left) was obviously the inspiration for this observer (right). The powerful central light source creates a chiaroscuro effect. The light illuminating the scene has been described as \\"so brilliant it could only be the light of revelation\\".Kimmelman 1990. The single source of light is obscured behind the bowl on the table; some hint of a lamp glass can be seen around the side of the bowl, but David Hockney has suggested that the bowl itself may contain sulphur, giving a powerful single light source that a candle or oil lamp would not.Hockney 2001, p. 129. In the earlier study a candle holder is visible, and the flame is reflected in the bowl. Hockney believes that many of the Old Masters used optical equipment to assist in their painting, and suggests that Wright may have used lenses to transfer the image to paper rather than painting directly from the scene, as he believes the pattern of shadows thrown by the lighting could have been too complicated for Wright to have captured so accurately without assistance. It may be observed, however, that the stand on which the pump is situated casts no shadow on the body of the philosopher, as it could be expected to do. Wright's Air Pump was unusual in that it depicted archetypes rather than specific people, though various models for the figures have been suggested. The young lovers may have been based on Thomas Coltman and Mary Barlow, friends of Wright's, whom he later painted in Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman (also in the National Gallery) after their marriage in 1769; Erasmus Darwin has been suggested as the man timing the experiment on the left of the table, and John Warltire, whom Darwin had invited to help with some air pump experiments in real life, as the natural philosopher;Nicolson 1968, p. 117. but Wright never identified any of the subjects or suggested they were based on real people. In The Orrery, all the subjects have been identified apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760‚Äì1761 and the figure of the boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man leaning on a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even the figure of the natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work there is no evidence of him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the Air Pump was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.Nicolson 1968, pp. 41‚Äì45. Wright's scientific paintings adopted elements from the tradition of history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, as well as his close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a snapshot of the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.Solkin 1994, p. 235. Reception Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman may have been the model for the two lovers. The scientific subjects of Wright's paintings from this time were meant to appeal to the wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the Lunar Society: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as Josiah Wedgwood, who later commissioned paintings from him.Harrison 2006, p. 317. The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like The Orrery, Wright apparently painted Air Pump without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr Benjamin Bates, who already owned Wright's Gladiator. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the Hellfire Club. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: Pd¬£200 is shown in one place and ¬£210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for ¬£130, stating that the low price \\"might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures, and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum.\\"Nicolson 1968, p. 105. Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received ¬£30 in part payment.Nicolson 1968, p. 235. Detail of the painting Wright exhibited the painting at the Society of Artists exhibition in 1768 and it was re-exhibited before Christian VII of Denmark in September the same year. Viewers remarked that it was \\"clever and vigorous\\", while Gustave Flaubert, who saw it on a visit to England in 1865‚Äì66, considered it \\"charmant de na√Øvet√© et profondeur\\". It was popular enough that a mezzotint was engraved from it by Valentine Green which was published by John Boydell on 24 June 1769, and initially sold for 15 shillings. This was reprinted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, in increasingly weak impressions.Egerton 1998, p. 342. Ellis Waterhouse called it \\"one of the wholly original masterpieces of British art\\".Waterhouse, 1978, 286. From Bates, the picture passed to Walter Tyrell; another member of the Tyrell family, Edward, presented it to the National Gallery, London, in 1863, after it had failed to sell at an auction at Christie's in 1854. The painting was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1929, although it was actually on loan to Derby Museum and Art Gallery between 1912 and 1947. It has been lent out for exhibitions to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1976, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm in 1979‚Äì1980, and Paris (Grand Palais), New York (Metropolitan) and the Tate in London in 1990. It was reclaimed by the National Gallery from the Tate in 1986.Egerton 1998, 332. \\"Egerton (1990)\\" is the catalogue for the 1990 exhibition Wright of Derby in London, Paris and New York. They describe its condition as good, with minor alterations visible on some figures. It was last cleaned in 1974.Egerton 1998, p. 334. The striking scene has been used as the cover illustration for many books on topics both artistic and scientific. It has even spawned pastiches and parodies: the book cover of The Science of Discworld, by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen, is a tribute to the painting by artist Paul Kidby, who replaces Wright's figures with the book's protagonists.

It specializes in the design, production, and publication of illustrated books and multimedia products. The company is known for producing Madonna's books, including Sex (1992) and The English Roses (2003), as well as the Miss Spider series, created originally by David Kirk. The company began publishing its own books in 2000, after acquiring its first imprint one year earlier. In 2005, the company had its name change to Callaway Arts & Entertainment to signify its change in direction.  History  Callaway Editions was founded in 1980 by Nicholas Callaway. The company began by producing photography books, with the first of its books by artist Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. After producing Alfred Stieglitz: Photographs & Writings (1983), by Sarah Greenough and Juan Hamilton, the company began branching out by including books about design, sculpture and contemporary culture. The company produced Madonna's coffee table book, Sex (1992), which was published by Warner Books. The book, which was accompanied by a CD, was part of a new strategy by publishers to attract customers. The single \\"Erotica\\" was included in the CD and served as promotional material for her album. The book sold 1.4 million copies, which made it the bestselling illustrated book in history, and also guaranteed some notoriety for the Callaway Editions. With the help of Charles Melcher, Callaway Editions also produced in the same year Ferrington Guitars, its first product in the \\"BoundSound\\" series, which used the same strategy of selling the book alongside a CD. On November of the same year, the company announced Malcolm Speaks Out (1992), a \\"BoundSound\\" book with photos of Malcolm X and a CD with some of his speeches. The company was considered to be \\"at the forefront of the book-CD trend,\\" and they believed that record stores would become an important section for selling books in this series. In a 1999 profile by Fortune, the company's founder said their strategy was different from most other publishing companies. Instead of publishing a large amount of books hoping some will sell well, Callaway Editions instead focuses on a smaller number of titles, and \\"markets them like crazy.\\" Madonna's book was among one of the company's biggest seller, at the mark of 1.4 million units worldwide, which marked it as the bestselling illustrated book in history at the time. = Publishing = In 2000, one year after acquiring Callaway Golf Media Venture, Callaway Editions moved from being a \\"book packager\\" to a publishing house. According to its founder, one of the reasons for the change was \\"the new channels of distribution\\", which would allow to reach broader markets, while still serving the US region through specialty retailers. In its publishing list were included 20 titles, ranging from children's books to photography, fashion and art, among other areas. These also included books under their new imprint, Callaway Golfer. That same year, the company's website was launched, and Callaway announced his company would soon begin working on e-books, focusing on titles for children. The company changed its name to Callaway Arts & Entertainment in 2005, to signify the company's change of direction. Two years later, after having watched a speech by Steve Jobs and spending some time in Silicon Valley, Nicholas Callaway noticed the importance of technology for business. He then adopted a model he called \\"a platform-agnostic intellectual property and production company.\\" In 2011, Callaway said the company had stopped publishing books directly, instead choosing to license the company's titles to other publishers. This included the ending of his business that was responsible for selling products such as backpacks and watering cans. Callaway also said at the time that the company's intention when signing new books is to produce an interactive app, instead of a physical book.  Imprints and divisions  = Callaway & Kirk Company = In 1991, Callaway met David Kirk after buying one of his toys, \\"Sneaking Baby Alligator with Spinning Eyes\\". Callaway, who, at the time, was looking to expand the catalog of the company, saw Kirk's drawings in the toy's box and tracked him down to make a publishing deal. Kirk, who had been working as a toymaker for some years, mostly making toys for \\"Peter-Pan adults\\" and selling them for a higher price, also had been considering writing a children's book. Kirk, whose idea to create Miss Spider came from his daughter's interest on insects, had already made a deal with Rizzoli International Publications, for $5,000 in advance, but Callaway offered a new deal of $20,000. After being rejected by several publishers, Scholastic accepted Callaway's terms of a large printing volume, in part due to the publisher's large distribution channels of schools and fairs. In 1994, the first Miss Spider book, called Miss Spider's Tea Party, was released. The first book had a successful launch, with Madonna reading on a live broadcast in 1995. On that same year, the Callaway & Kirk Company was created to manage Kirk's creations. By 1999, they had already published eight children's books, with the most recent one being Nova's Ark (1999), which utilized 3D art for its illustrations, instead of the usual paintings. The book sold 400 thousand copies in its release year. In 2003, a one hour special was released on Nickelodeon, called Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Kids. The special, which aired on 31 March, was co-produced by Nelvana, and had actress Brooke Shields as the voice of Miss Spider. On September 2004, a new television show, Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends, debuted on the same channel, with a daily average viewership of around one million children. The show was Nick Jr.'s highest rating premiere since 2001, when Bob the Builder premiered. = Callaway Golfer = In early 1998, it was announced that Callaway Editions and Callaway Golf Company, headed by Nicholas' father, Ely Callaway Jr., had created a new joint venture, called Callaway Golf Media Venture. The venture was focused on making and publishing books about golf with the help of well-known writers. On November of the same year, the Callaway Golf Company announced that, due to financial difficulties and after downsizing, they would be selling their shares of the venture to Callaway Editions. During the acquisition, Nicholas Callaway announced the rebranding to Callaway Golfer, and would work as an imprint of the company. The company also retained part of the original board, which included Ed Brash and golfer journalist, Larry Dorman. The acquisition was finalized on April 1999, and its first books were published in 2000, coinciding with the company's change of direction to work as a full-on publisher. = Callaway Digital Arts = On August 2010, the company established the Callaway Digital Arts, Inc., with offices in New York City and San Francisco. This division is responsible for developing and publishing apps on the iPad. Callaway Digital Arts was funded after Apple's CEO, Steve Jobs, showed interest in a mobile app that had been released earlier in the year by Callaway Arts & Entertainment. The app was an interactive version of the Miss Spider's Tea Party book from 1994. Callaway Digital Arts received a total of $6 million in funding, which included financing by Ram Shriram and Mark Pincus. One of its first partnerships was with a company headed by Martha Stewart, with whom Callaway struck a deal to publish some of her recipes on the iPad. They've also partnered with the company behind Sesame Street to release a digital version of the book The Monster at the End of this Book, as well as apps focused on the Thomas and Friends series. On October 2011, the company announced the appointment of Rex Ishibashi as its CEO. On February 2012, it was announced that Lisa Holton, CEO and founder of Fourth Story Media had been named VP of content development for Callaway Digital Arts. This move was done to help develop an interactive educational program that was being funded by the Department of Education, but it also resulted in the acquisition of some properties that were held by Holton's former company.

She was later transferred to the French Navy as Bambara. Swearer was laid down by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newark, New Jersey on 12 August 1943, launched on 31 October 1943, and commissioned on 23 November 1943. Swearer was named for Lt. Walter John Swearer who was killed in action aboard during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in October 1942. History =World War II= 1944 From commissioning until mid- January 1944, Swearer was attached to the Operational Training Command, Atlantic Fleet for shakedown training and post-shakedown availability. On 19 January 1944, she put to sea from New York City in the screen of a convoy of troop transports bound for the Panama Canal. She transited the canal at the end of January and continued on to Hawaii. Swearer arrived in Pearl Harbor on 15 February and remained there until the 29th, conducting training and undergoing repairs. On the 29th, she set sail for Eniwetok Atoll in the screen of a convoy and, after a stop at Kwajalein, reached her destination on 8 March. For a little more than ten months, Swearer contributed to America's war effort in the Pacific by shepherding the logistics groups which supported the fighting. During the bulk of the time, she operated from Eniwetok and Ulithi atolls, screening the fueling group of the 3rd/5th fleets to and from fueling rendezvous. In being so engaged, the destroyer escort participated in the raids on Palau, Yap, Woleai, Truk, Sata-wan, and Ponape in March and April 1944. In early April, she also screened escort carriers from Manus to resupply rendezvous with the larger carriers then engaged in operations in western New Guinea. After a month at Pearl Harbor in repairs, she returned to the central Pacific and to screening duty with the fueling group. She participated in the capture and occupation of the Mariana Islands between June and August, then moved south to Manus to screen escort carriers during the western Carolines and Leyte operations. In November, Swearer resumed duty with the fueling group. During these last three months with the fueling groups, she supported the fast carriers as they struck Luzon in the Philippines and as they made their sweep of Formosa, the China coast, and of the Nansei Shoto. 1945 After repairs and upkeep at Ulithi in the western Carolines, from 21 January to 6 February 1945, Swearer joined a convoy of cargo and troopships bound for the invasion of Iwo Jima. The convoy stopped at Guam for a week, then headed for Iwo Jima on 6 February. Swearer and her convoy arrived off the island on 19 February, the date of the assault. For five days, she patrolled the transport area and helped fight off Japanese air attacks, before departing on the 23rd for Leyte Gulf in the Philippines. The destroyer escort remained in San Pedro Bay until 19 March, preparing for the invasion of Okinawa. Between the 19-26 March, she screened a convoy of cargo, troop, and amphibious warfare ships to the Okinawa staging area at Kerama Retto. Swearer remained in the vicinity of Okinawa for three months, patrolling, screening, escorting, and fighting off kamikaze attacks. She was attacked by a \\"Zeke\\" on the day of the invasion, but her gunners brought him down before he could crash her. On 16 April, a \\"Val\\" tried to crash-dive Swearer, but again her gunners brought him down. The destroyer escort continued to patrol Kerama Retto until 5 July. She suffered two more air attacks during that time, one by a bomber on 13 May and another by a torpedo bomber on 27 June. In both cases, however, neither plane nor ship inflicted damage upon the other. For the duration of the war the Swearer was under the command of Captains John M. Trent and Kenneth H. Hannan. During her long tour of duty the Swearer received a total of 9 battle stars, 7 for the Philippine liberation and 2 for surviving without injury or damage following actions of aerial strafing, aerial torpedo, dive-bombing, two kamikaze attacks, and Typhoon Cobra. Swearer returned to Eniwetok on 12 July, and headed for the United States on the following day. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she entered San Diego on 27 July, and commenced overhaul. Three months later, she headed south to the Panama Canal, transited it on 4 November, and headed north to Norfolk, where she arrived on 10 November. =Decommissioning and transfer = On 25 February 1946, Swearer was placed out of commission and berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida. She remained there until the spring of 1950, when she was moved to Philadelphia to repair for turnover to the Republic of France. On 16 September 1950, she joined the French Navy as Bambara (F-719), and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 October 1950. Bambara was stricken by the French Navy and broken up in 1959.

The Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the agency with overall responsibility for environmental protection in the Republic of Ireland and monitors rates of recycling in Ireland along with other measures of environmental conditions in Ireland. The EPA, along with Repak, the principal organisation for packaging recycling in Ireland, report on recycling rates each year. In 2012 Ireland‚Äôs MSW recycling rate was 34%, while the rate of packaging recycling reached 79% (the second highest in the European Union behind Germany).Waste Atlas(2012). Country Data: IRELAND The amount of municipal waste generated per person per year in the Republic of Ireland has fallen significantly in recent years (from over 800 kg of waste in 2007 to 570 kg per person in 2012).Waste Atlas (2012). Country Data: IRELAND This figure remains above the European Union annual municipal waste average of 503 kg per person however. Each local council in Ireland has considerable control over recycling, so recycling practices vary to some extent across the country. Most waste that is not recycled is disposed of in landfill sites. Plastic Bag Levy One noticeable success in Ireland's environmental track record was the introduction of a plastic bag levy in 2002, the first country in the world to do so. All consumers were required to pay 15c for a plastic bag; this led to an immediate decrease of over 90% in the amount of plastic bags in circulation. From 328 bags per inhabitant per year when the levy was introduced, usage fell to 21 bags per capita. The levy encouraged retailers to switch to paper bags, and encouraged consumers to bring their own bags when shopping. The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System showed that when the levy was introduced, 5% of all litter was plastic bags. The 2006 figure is 0.5%. Media coverage also helped raise awareness about the damage plastic bags do to the environment. There has been some evidence of complacency, however, suggesting that the number of plastic bags had begun to rise again to 33 bags per capita. To address this, the levy was increased in July 2006 to 22c; preliminary figures indicate the rate has again fallen to 21 bags per capita. In Dunnes Stores single use bags are no longer sold. Customers may purchase a bag for life priced at ‚Ç¨1. WEEE The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive was introduced into Irish law in August 2005. Under this law, retailers of electrical goods are required to provide free in-store take back for old electrical goods for customers buying new electrical equipment. The cost of this is passed onto consumers. Ireland is the top country in Europe for electronics recycling as a result of the WEEE directive, with 30,000 tonnes of electrical and electronic being collected in 2008. This works out at around 9 kilograms per person, a figure more than double the EU target.BreakingNews.ie ‚Äì Ireland tops EU table for electronics recycling (20 April, 2009) Packaging Repak is Ireland's packaging recovery organisation. Repak is a not for profit company set up by Irish business and owned by its members. Repak charges fees to its members in accordance with the amount and type of packaging they place on the Irish market. These fees are used to subsidise the collection and recovery of waste packaging through registered recovery operators across Ireland ‚Äì so that the individual member companies are exempt from this requirement. Repak is approved under licence by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to operate as a compliance scheme for packaging recovery. Since Repak was set up in 1997 packaging recycling in Ireland has grown from a very low base to the point where Ireland is now one of the leading recycling countries in the EU. For more, see www.repak.ie Practices around the country Although waste collection practices vary in each county in Ireland, most services share the guiding principles that waste is sorted into different categories at household level and that waste collection charges are highest for waste going to landfill sites. Waste collection services have been increasingly run by private companies, rather than local government, over the last decade. In Dublin several companies now compete to provide waste collection services. Grey bins are used to collect non-recyclable waste. Green bins, used to collect packaging waste and glass, are collected every two weeks-householders can dispose of paper, cardboard, cans, plastic bottles and tins in this bin, and it is illegal to dispose of such waste in a grey bin.Dublin City Profile, p. 57. National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis (NIRSA). January 2002.Grey bins are used to collect non-recyclable waste. Annual Report, p. 19. Dublin City Council, 2001. \\"Recycling Initiative: Last year [2000] Dublin City Council commenced a major recycling drive with the aim of dramatically reducing the amount of waste. A dual bin system was introduced for individual households, a grey bin for general waste and a green bin for dry recyclable waste. Nine Bring Centres, which consist of bottle banks and recycling facilities were made available at various locations around the City in 2001. At the end of the year 54 public and 53 private bring centres were in operation.\\" Most householders have to pay every time their grey bin is collected. In 2008 Dublin City Council introduced use of a third bin (brown bin) to households in Dublin City Council area. This was introduced to reduce landfill use for compostable waste. Households use this brown bin to dispose of compostable waste such as grass and hedge cuttings and uncooked food waste. Dublin City Council began to charge for waste collection to fund improvements in recycling facilities. Nine Bring Centres, which consist of bottle banks and recycling facilities were made available at various locations around the City in 2001. At the end of the year 54 public and 53 private bring centres were in operation.\\" Most householders have to pay every time their grey bin is collected but pay a lesser fee for collection of their brown bin and no fee for collection of their green bin. This system is designed to discourage people from using the grey bin and therefore to reduce the amount of waste going into landfill. In Dundalk, took over from the Dundalk Town Council for waste disposal. They have since in introduced a green bins (2001) and brown bins (2007) along with the black bin. Up until the 2007 the black bins were collected every week but now they are collected every second week with the other bins been collected the week the black bins are not collected. Variations of this system are in place across the country. Some local authorities, such as Limerick County Council, now outsource all waste collection to private authorities. Householders can choose what size bin they want, and pay accordingly. However, they are not charged every time the bin is collected. Other councils operate a weigh-and-pay system, where households are charged according to the weight of the waste collected,for example,South Tipperary County Council charge 14c per kg (accurate as of 31 August 2007). Recyclable waste in South Tipperary is collected separately in plastic bags which are purchased at local shops, together with stickers that are placed on the bags. In Galway city, over 50% of waste is now recycled, the highest proportion in the country. Websites have been set up where people can post their junk or items they no longer need and have it taken away, such as , or the well known freecycle sites. There has been a sharp increase in the number of bottle banks and recycling facilities across the country over the last 10 years, but facilities continue to struggle with demand. Greyhound Recycling and Recovery is one of the major private waste collection company in the area.

The canal connects Lilla V√§rtan to Lake Brunnsviken, and delimits Bergshamra, the northern part of Solna, from the northern part of Djurg√•rden. The name √Ölkistan first appears on a map of Djurg√•rden dated 1649, pointing out √Öhlekijstetorpet (\\"The Eel Hatch Cottage\\"), √Öhlekijstebackan (\\"The Eel Hatch Hillside\\") and √Öhlekijste wijken (\\"The Eel Hatch Bay\\"). In a rivulet leading to the bay eels were caught using cages (in Swedish called kista, \\"coffin\\"), which gave the area its present name. The cottage is mentioned as a tavern in 1789. By the mid-19th century, mud threatened to cork the rivulet, which would effectively have turned Lake Brunnsviken, being used as refuse dump as it was, into a sewer. King Charles XV therefore ordered the present canal to be constructed in 1863, which lowered the water level of Brunnsviken by two metres. A wooden bridge with a mobile flap leading over the canal was added at the same time. The bridge was substituted in 1937 by a bridge with an roadway and a horizontal clearance of 8 metres, rebuilt in 1972. There was a railway stop at √Ölkistan from 1885 until 1923, at the Roslag Railway. The railway is still operational, but the trains do not stop at √Ölkistan anymore. , no ships wider than 4.0 metres or deeper than 1.6 metres are allowed in the canal. Next to √Ölkistan is a residential area, Sf√§ren (\\"The Sphere\\"), with a local centre.

(2 March 1756 - 21 August 1845) was a French royalist politician, writer and artist. He was a deputy for the Seine-et-Marne ' in the French Legislative Assembly, served as President of the same body, and from 26 September 1815 to 7 May 1816, he was the French Minister of the Interior. His political career had him rubbing shoulders with Louis XVI, Napoleon Bonaparte, the Count of Artois (the future Charles X of France), and finally Louis XVIII. He was banished and recalled four times by different regimes, never arrested, succeeding each time in regaining official favour. In a long and eventful career, he was successively a monarchist deputy during the Revolution and under the Directoire, an exile during the Terror, a deputy under Napoleon, Minister of the Interior to Louis XVIII and eventually, at the end of his political career, a simple ultra-royalist deputy. He is remembered now for the fiery eloquence of his speeches, and for his controversial reorganisation of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1816 while Minister of the Interior. A man of order, he was a moderate supporter of the Revolution of 1789 and ended his political life under the Restoration as a radical counterrevolutionary. Military education under the Ancien R√©gime Coat-of-arms of the Vaublanc family. Born and raised at Fort-Dauphin, Saint-Domingue (now Fort-Libert√©, Haiti), into an aristocratic family from Bourgogne, he was the eldest son of Vivant-Fran√ßois Vi√©not de Vaublanc, commanding officer of Fort Saint-Louis in Fort-Dauphin. He saw Metropolitan France for the first time at the age of seven. After military education at the Prytan√©e National Militaire in La Fl√®che, and at the √âcole Militaire in Paris from 1770 to 1774, he was decorated with the Order of Saint Lazarus (before he had even set foot outside the school) by the Comte de Provence, the future Louis XVIII, Grand Master of the Order. He was admitted as second-lieutenant to the R√©giment de la Sarre, which was controlled by the Duc de Liancourt from 1776 to 1782, and in which his uncle Charles was lieutenant-colonel. He was garrisoned successively at Metz, at Rouen and at Lille, before obtaining lettres de service for Saint-Domingue to attend to family affairs.Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne, ed. Michaud (suppl√©ment page 170) There he married one Mademoiselle de Fontenelle, and returned to France in 1782 with a daughter. He purchased the office of lieutenant des mar√©chaux de France for Dammarie-les-Lys, near Melun, and a house in the region, giving his profession as gentleman-farmer. The responsibility of his station was to act as arbiter in legal disputes which involved points of honour, and this permitted him to make the acquaintance of a number of aristocrats in the region. It also gave him the time to study agriculture, literature and the arts. Political career during the French Revolution =Convocation of the French States-General (1789‚Äì1791)= Seduced at first by the new ideas of the Revolution, he threw himself into a political career by becoming an aristocratic member of the bailliage of Melun in 1789. He was elected secretary of this assembly, under its president M. de Gouy d'Arcy, grand bailli of Melun, a fellow member of the famous explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville. The Assembly was assigned the task of drawing up a list of grievances to be submitted to the King and naming a deputy to the States-General. Vaublanc supported Fr√©teau de Saint-Just, an elected d√©put√© de la noblesse for the bailliage of Melun who was to become a member of the National Constituent Assembly.M√©moires sur la R√©volution de France et recherches sur les causes qui ont amen√© la R√©volution de 1789 et celles qui l'ont suivie (tome I, livre II, chapitre II, page 182), Chez G-A. Dentu, imprimeur-libraire, rue d'Erfurth, n 1 bis, Paris, 1833. In 1790, Vaublanc became a member and later president of the conseil g√©n√©ral of Seine-et-Marne. This gave him the right to preside over the administrative directory of this '.M√©moires (tome I, livre II, chapitre IV, page 256) =Losing ground to the Jacobins under the Legislative Assembly (1791)= After the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the electoral colleges reconvened to elect new deputies. Vaublanc was elected president of that of Seine-et-Marne. On 1 September 1791, he was elected deputy of Seine-et-Marne at the Legislative Assembly, the eighth out of eleven,by 273 votes out of 345.Dictionnaire des parlementaires fran√ßais depuis le 1er mai 1789 jusqu'au 1er mai 1889 publi√© sous la direction de MM. Adolphe Robert, Edgar Bourloton et Gaston Cougny, Paris, Bourloton Editeur, 1889‚Äì1891, 5 vol.; in-8. He was one of the few to have any political experience, notably on the question of the Antilles, in an assembly composed essentially of political novices. Faithful to their promises, not one former member of the Constituent Assembly had been admitted. =A leader of the Club des Feuillants (1791‚Äì1792)= From this point on, he took the name of Vi√©not- Vaublanc, which he retained until the end of the First Empire in 1814. From the very moment of his appearance, he made himself conspicuous by delivering a speech which denounced the humiliating terms on which Louis XVI was to be received by the Assembly the next day.M√©moires (tome I, livre III, chapitre I, page 285)According to custom, a chair in the form of a throne, covered with gold and fleur de lys, was to be reserved for the King. Couthon proposed to give him a chair similar to the President's; Grangeneuve asked that the words Sires and Majest√© \\"which are the inventions of servility, be replaced by Roi des Fran√ßais, a much more attractive appellation.\\" A motion was voted on, which resulted in the King's chair being lowered by one step. When Louis XVI threatened to boycott the Assembly, a compromise was reached and the seat of the King was lowered. See Feuillant et Girondins ao√ªt 1791 - 20 avril 1792 by Dom H Leclerc, Paris, 1940, Letouzet et Ane, 87 boulevard Raspail. As a result of these statements, he was elected president from 15 November to 28 November 1791 by the assembly, the majority of whom were royalist.L'ami des citoyens, num√©ro 13, 16 November 1791, imprimerie Demonville. Louis XVI On 29 November, Vaublanc was assigned the task of composing a message to the King, asking him to withdraw his veto of the decree of 9 November, a decree designed to slow the massive emigrations (then encouraged by the priests and the nobility) by threatening reprisals against German princes who continued to offer refuge to the armies of French noblemen (such as those of the Comte d'Artois, and of the Prince of Cond√©). The assembly was so pleased with his work that they asked him to read it to the King personally. Louis XVI replied that he would take the request into serious consideration, and, several days later, personally announced his decision on the matter. On this occasion Vaublanc made a name for himself by informing the assembly \\"that the King had made the first bow, and he had only returned the gesture.\\"Biographie universelle (suppl√©ment page 171) The anecdote reveals the shift in constitutional forces: the legislative power, embodied in the Legislative Assembly, was clearly ascendant over the executive, embodied in Louis XVI, who was now no more than the \\"King of the French\\" or roi des fran√ßais. Vaublanc now sided with the constitutional monarchists and joined the Amis de la Constitution (dubbed the Club des Feuillants) with 263 other colleagues out of the 745 deputies. He became one of its principal figures, along with Jacques Claude Beugnot, Mathieu Dumas and Jaucourt, after the departure of Barnave and C. Lameth. He vigorously opposed revolutionary governments and was characterised by his loyalty to the King, his opposition to repressive measures against rebellious priests and to laws confiscating the goods of √©migr√©s, and his denunciation of the massacres at Avignon. Debate became steadily more extreme. The crowds attending these debates often shouted at him (as they did at Charles de Lacretelle) \\"√Ä la lanterne!\\"Charles de Lacretelle in \\"Dix ans d'√©preuve sous la R√©volution\\" (1842) Nicolas de Condorcet, his hostile colleague in the Legislative Assembly in 1791, said of him: \\"There are, at all meetings, these noisy air-headed orators, who produce a great effect through the constant repetition of redundant inanities.\\"Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXeme si√®cle edited by Pierre Larousse. Brissot, one of the chief Girondists in the Legislative Assembly, nicknamed him le chef des bicam√©ristes.M√©moires (tome I, page 338) =The fall of the monarchy (1792)= In 1792, he defended the Comte de Rochambeau before the Assembly and obtained his acquittal. Following the majority of the Assembly who sought to abolish slavery in the Antilles, he nevertheless took aim in a speech of 20 March at those hardline abolitionists like Brissot who knew little of life in the colonies and of the risks of civil war given the diversity of ethnicities and social conflicts in Saint-Domingue. He supported the law of 4 April 1792 which granted citizenship to all \\"coloured men and free Negroes\\". At the meeting of 10 April, he declared himself in favour of the progressive abolition of the slave trade throughout the colonies, following the examples of Denmark and Great Britain. On 3 May 1792, he supported the proposition of Beugnot which provoked an accusatory decree from Marat and the abb√© Royou, and on 8 May, at the Assembly, he addressed the Jacobins in these terms: \\"You wish, sirs, to save the Constitution; and yet, you cannot do so without beating down factions and the factious, without setting everything besides the rule of law to one side, without dying with the Law and for the Law, and I declare that I shall not be the last who shall die with you, in order to see it preserved; believe it, sirs....\\"Dictionnaire des parlementaires fran√ßais On 18 June, he was elected a member of the Commission des douze (Committee of Twelve), created by Marat to examine the State of France and to propose means of preserving the Constitution, liberty, and the Empire. He gave his resignation on 30 July. The defence of La Fayette Following the events of 20 June 1792, La Fayette arrived in Paris on 28 June, hoping to convince the King to leave in order to head the armies assembled in the north. At the head of the National Guard, he tried to close down the political clubs, but his attempt failed, partly because of the Court's refusal to support him. In reaction to this, the left wing of the Assembly decided to charge Lafayette with treason. On 8 August 1792, ill at ease and shocked by the course of events, Vaublanc delivered a speech before the Assembly, in which he defended, vigorously, and courageously, against the lively opposition of the Jacobins who dominated the Assembly and of the man in the street, General La Fayette, who stood accused of violating the Constitution. He later claimed to have succeeded (with the help of Quatrem√®re de Quincy) in rallying 200 undecided deputies to his position. La Fayette was acquitted, by 406 votes out of 630.M√©moires (tome II, page 202) On departure, Vaublanc and about thirty other deputies were threatened, insulted and jostled by the hostile crowd which had attended the debate. Some deputies even took refuge in the guardroom of the Royal Palace, later exiting through the windows. Hippolyte Taine wrote: \\"After the principal defender of La Fayette, M. de Vaublanc, had been assaulted three times, he took the precaution of not immediately returning home; but the rabble besieged his house, shouting that eighty citizens must die by their hands, and that he should be the first; twelve men climbed to his apartment, ransacked it, and continued the search in neighbouring houses, hoping for members of his family if he himself could not be seized; he was informed that if he returned to his domicile he would be slaughtered.\\" As a result, on 9 August, Vaublanc asked for the removal of the f√©d√©r√©s and marseillais. The request was rejected by a majority of the Assembly.M√©moires (tome II, livre III, chapitre IX) August 10 On 10 August 1792, the day that marked the downfall of the Legislative Assembly and the Monarchy at the hands of the Paris Commune, he witnessed from his carriage the toppling of the statue of Louis XIV in what is now the Place Vend√¥me. He enjoined the Assembly to leave Paris for royalist Rouen to escape the revolutionary pressures, and he avoided an assassination attempt when he was narrowly saved from a sabre cut by a young officer of genius, Captain Louis Bertrand de Sivray, who was to make a name for himself as general. He was one of the eyewitnesses of the arrival of the Royal Family, who, after the March on the Tuileries, placed themselves under the protection of the Legislative Assembly at the Place du Carrousel. The incident is described in his memoirs.M√©moires (tome II, livre III, page 232) =Exiled during the Convention and the Reign of Terror (1792‚Äì1795)= 250px 350px The second volume of his memoirs provides insight into the general atmosphere at the time of the Terror, as felt by an aristocratic royalist, who was at risk of being arrested at any moment and finishing up on the scaffold, and yet forced to travel back and forth over the territory of the brand new French Republic. On the evening of 10 August he was obliged to take refuge at the home of Armand- Gaston Camus, the Assembly's archivist. Several days later he moved to the Hotel Strasbourg, on the rue Neuve Saint Eustache. On 3 September 1792, hearing a commotion in the courtyard, he thought himself betrayed; but it was in fact the passage of a rabble brandishing the head of the Princesse de Lamballe on a pole. The Committee of Public Safety, newly established, published a decree in which it was revealed that he was on the list of outlaws drawn up by the Municipality of Paris. This forced him to leave the city, first for Normandy, where he reunited with his family, then for his country house at B√©lombres near Melun. He lived in hiding for several months; it was there that he learnt that the newspaper Gorsas accused him among others of having \\"accepted 300,000 francs from the Queen for the purpose of organising the Counter-Revolution in Provence\\", and that he \\"met with them secretly.\\" The Law of Suspects went to the vote on 17 September 1793. His name appeared within. A revolutionary detachment came and ransacked his house, and he \\"fled by the highways\\" entirely on foot, throwing himself on the mercy of chance. He wandered from inn to inn, entering (he later wrote) every town in a terror of being recognised, especially when going to local authorities in order to get his passport stamped. At the trial of Marie Antoinette, on 14 October and 16 October 1793, his name appeared next to that of Jaucourt in the papers of the prosecutors. Opting at first for the south of France, and Bordeaux in particular, he changed direction after having learnt of the ferocious oppression led there by Tallien, the Convention's representative, and the dangers that travel in those regions entailed. He passed through Poitiers, and La Rochelle, where he stayed for one month. Wishing to avoid taking the risk of enlisting in the National Guard, where he could well be recognised, he feigned illness and obtained a medical certificate which would allow him to take a thermal cure at Cast√©ra-Verduzan in the Gers region. To allay suspicions, he took the precaution of regularly pricking his gums in order to simulate \\"incurable scurvy.\\" It was while at this spa that he learnt of the fall of Robespierre on 27 July 1794. He waited four months for his proscription to be lifted before returning to Paris. =A counterrevolutionary activist under the Directory (1795‚Äì1799)= On his return to Paris in the spring of 1795, he published his \\"Reflections on the foundations of a constitution\\" (R√©flexions sur les bases d'une constitution), under the pseudonym of L.-P. de S√©gur, tabled by his friend Bresson, then a deputy at the National Convention. In this work, he advocated the creation of two parliamentary chambers instead of one (as was the case under the Convention), in the belief that having only one chamber had been one of the causes of the Terror. He also advocated the installation of a single person as head of the Executive, for the sake of efficiency, as opposed to the Directory's five. After the appearance of this book, the committee entrusted with the drawing up of the Constitution of Year III (comprising Daunou and Fran√ßois-Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas) invited him to elaborate on his theories, but he refused. His ideas were nevertheless broadly followed, and two chambers representing the Legislature saw the light of day with the names \\"Council of Ancients (Elders)\\" and \\"Council of Five Hundred\\" (Conseil des Anciens and Conseil des Cinq- Cents). Opposed to the Decree of Two Thirds, he took on an active r√¥le with Antoine Chrysostome Quatrem√®re de Quincy at the time of the insurrection of 13 Vendemaire IV (5 October 1795). On this occasion, he discovered the tactical genius of Bonaparte, who became known as le g√©n√©ral Vend√©miaire. He was a member of the central royalist committee entrusted with replacing the Convention. On 17 October, as head of the royalist faction of the Faubourg Poissonni√®re, he was condemned to death in absentia by a military commission presided over by General Lostange, which had its headquarters at the Th√©√¢tre- Fran√ßais. This obliged him to go into hiding for a second time, mostly at the residence of Sophie Cottin, a friend of Bresson's wife. He took advantage of his stay there by making sketches of Cottin. Several days later, the Convention, forced to hold new elections, assembled the electoral colleges. This election brought a majority of royalists into the Senate and into the Council of 500. The college of Melun elected Vaublanc as deputy for Seine-et- Marne and as a member of the Council of 500; however he had to wait for his friends Desfourneaux and Pastoret to overturn his sentence (by reason of unconstitutionality). This was made easier because of the fear inspired in the Assembly by Conspiration des √âgaux at the end of August 1796. On 2 September 1796, he delivered the famous speech \\"I swear hatred for royalty!\\" which, according to legend, was interrupted by a highlander who shouted \\"Speak up!\\"  to which Vaublanc responded instantly: \\"Keep it down!\\" The elections of Year V (May 1797), in which one third of the representatives were replaced, turned the tables in favour of the royalists, who achieved a majority in both chambers. On 20 May 1797 (20 prairial V), Charles Pichegru was elected president of the Council of 500 and Barb√©-Marbois of the Council of Elders. Vaublanc himself was named membre du bureau of the Council of 500. On the same day, the Legislature proceeded to replace the republican Director, Le Tourneur (who had gained the position by drawing straws), with the moderate royalist Fran√ßois de Barth√©l√©my, at that time the French ambassador to Switzerland. Vaublanc voted against his nomination, preferring General Beurnonville, who was known for his forcefulness. The new majority supported freedom of the press, which allowed attacks on the Directory to be made with impunity. The Club de Clichy, of which Vaublanc was a prominent member, began to control the two councils, and directly threatened the Directory. He was appointed to their committee of inspectors, and given the r√¥le of policing the councils and maintaining their security from within. As a result, he had the power to give orders to the councils' brigadiers. The Directory, cornered, counterattacked with the 80,000-strong army of Sambre-et-Meuse, which approached Paris under the command of Hoche. At the same time, Vaublanc pleaded for and obtained from the Council an order dissolving all clubs, including those of the Jacobins. On 16 July 1797, under pressure from the councils, the three republican directors, Barras, Reubell and La Reveilli√®re-L√©peaux, ordered a ministerial reshuffle disadvantaging the royalists. On 3 September, Vaublanc, with his colleague Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse and other clichiens, was a hair's breadth from achieving a coup d'√©tat against the triumvirate of republican directors. Their plan, which convinced the director Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot, was simple. Vaublanc was charged with delivering a speech on 4 September before the Council of 500 which would demand the impeachment of the triumvirate. Meanwhile, General Pichegru, who had been persuaded by Carnot to join the conspiracy at the head of the Legislature's Guard, would come to arrest the directors.M√©moires (tome II, livre IV, chapitre IV) Unfortunately for him, General Bonaparte, then head of the Arm√©e d'Italie, intercepted a royalist agent, Louis-Alexandre de Launay, comte d'Antraigues, in possession of documents revealing the conspiracy and the treason of Pichegru. He sent General Pierre Augereau and his army to Paris, where the general advertised the treason with posters in the streets. The principal conspirators were either arrested and deported to Guyana (like Pichegru and Barth√©l√©my), or forced to flee (like Carnot and Vaublanc). The latter managed to escape the city limits of Paris, which was then still in a state of siege, by hiding in a carriage. This escape was achieved through the connivance of Rochambeau. Vaublanc made it to Italy with the help of various disguises; on his way he passed through Switzerland, where he stayed with his friend Pastoret. Under Napoleon The coup d'√©tat of 18 Brumaire VIII (10 November 1799), and the accession to power of the Consulat, which gave amnesty to the proscribed, permitted him to return to France, where he was presented to Bonaparte. =Deputy to the Corps l√©gislatif (1800‚Äì1805)= Ingres. In 1800, Vaublanc was elected by the conservative Senate to be deputy for Calvados, one of 300 members of the Legislature (Corps l√©gislatif), and to fulfil the duties of questeur for a five-year term. Among those duties was that of issuing regular reports on the Consulate for the rest of his life. The admiration and respect which he felt towards Napoleon for having \\"reestablished order in France and put an end to the persecution of priests\\" can be seen in several of his speeches at this time: for example that of 24 flor√©al X to the consuls, in his capacity as deputy to the Legislature, a speech which is flattering to the First Consul, or that of 24 niv√¥se XIII (13 January 1805), this time delivered before Napol√©on I, who had in the meantime become empereur des fran√ßais, when together with Jean-Pierre Louis de Fontanes, Acting President of the Legislature, Vaublanc attended the inauguration of a marble statue of the Emperor in the hall of the Legislature, which had been commissioned to honour the \\"father of the Civil Code.\\" He was President of the Legislature from 21 April to 7 May 1803. On 4 November 1804, Pope Pius VII stayed the night at Vaublanc's house in Montargis, 28 rue de Loing, while travelling to Paris for the coronation of the Emperor. =Prefect of Moselle (1805‚Äì1814)= At the end of his term as deputy, in 1805 the electoral college of Seine-et-Marne put him up as a candidate for the Senate, but he was not retained. Interested by the administrative and territorial reorganisations that were taking place, he managed to obtain a prefecture, and on 1 February 1805 at Metz he was named pr√©fet de la Moselle (prefect or chief administrator of the d√©partement of Moselle). He became known for his activism and for his habit of roaming his d√©partement on horseback and not by stagecoach as was customary for prefects. Napoleon rewarded him for his zeal: he was made Commander of the L√©gion d'honneur, knighted on 28 November 1809, made baron d'Empire on 19 December 1809 (a hereditary title), and was bestowed on 17 July 1810 with a majorat in Hannover. In June of that year he had an audience with the Emperor at the time of his passage through Metz, during which, according to the third volume of his Memoirs, he strongly objected to the idea of a campaign against Russia. During the campaign of 1813, after the withdrawal of the Mainz Army from Leipzig, a large number of wounded soldiers took refuge in Metz, resulting in a typhoid epidemic of which Vaublanc fell victim; he escaped death narrowly. In 1814, he opened the gates of Metz to welcome the coalition forces. Under Louis XVIII =For the First Restoration and against the Hundred Days (1814‚Äì1815)= Maintained as Prefect of Moselle after the First Restoration, he was made an officier of the Legion of Honour on 23 August 1814. After the return of Napoleon he kept Metz loyal to Louis XVIII and, with Marshal Oudinot, the military governor of Metz, he attempted to hinder any Bonapartist rallies. An ordre d'arrestation, published by Marshal Davout in Le Moniteur Universel, forced him to flee towards Luxembourg, joining Louis XVIII at Ghent. It is said that, on meeting the officer assigned to arrest him, he said: \\"Do not worry about me. Better worry about your own self; no-one must see you leaving by the large courtyard\\", and led him to a side exit before galloping away on his horse. On his arrival, he encountered Chateaubriand, who mentions him in his M√©moires d'Outre-tombe: \\"M. de Vaublanc and M. Capelle joined us. The former said he had everything he could possibly need in his portfolio. You want Montesquieu? here you go; Bossuet? there you are.\\"M√©moires d'Outre-tombe (troisi√®me partie, livre VI, chapitre VI) He submitted to the King, via the Comte d'Artois, several essays on the state of the country, and predicted that His Majesty \\"would be on his way back to Paris in two months or less.\\" After the Second Restoration, in order to thank him for his loyalty Louis XVIII named him State Councillor on the spot, and, on 27 December 1815, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. In July, he sent him to Marseilles to be Prefect of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, and to liberate five to six hundred Bonapartist prisoners, a surprising act which was appropriate under the circumstances (Marseilles being under English control, and convulsed by anti- Bonapartist violence). =Ultra-royalist Minister of the Interior (1815‚Äì1816)= Wishing to live down his Bonapartist past, he became known as one of the most fervent leaders of the party of \\"Ultras\\", even going so far (while Minister of the Interior) as to remove the letter N from the bridges of Paris. On 26 September 1815, thanks largely to the support of his friend the Comte d'Artois, the King named him Minister of the Interior and of Public Instruction. The new President of the Council, the Duc de Richelieu, who had been forced to nominate him, had a ruling on his nomination suspended, but he was not quick enough and on hearing the good news Vaublanc wasted no time in establishing himself firmly in his new ministry. This nomination demonstrates the influence that the Comte d'Artois exercised over the governments of his brother. He kept a rival court at the Marsan Pavilion and sought to restore Absolutism by rolling back the innovations that had been ushered in by the Revolution. Rudolf von Thadden, a contemporary German historian, summed up the comments of Martignac on 2 April 1829 by saying that his nomination was due more to his background than to his talents. Breathless devotion Vaublanc, at the head of his ministry, engaged immediately in Counter- Revolutionary activity that was so frenetic that even the King was to be describe it as \\"breathless devotion\\". On the tabling by the Keeper of the Seals of a law that would reestablish cours pr√©v√¥tales or \\"special courts\\" before the Chamber of Deputies (nicknamed the Chambre introuvable), Vaublanc shouted out: \\"France wants its King!\\" To great applause, both the deputies and the public gallery rose to their feet and repeated \\"Yes, France wants its King!\\" On 2 October 1815, one of his first measures was to send out a circular to all the departmental prefects informing them of their priorities in this troubled time: \\"The very first priority should be given to the maintenance of order (...) true vigilance foresees disorderliness and renders the use of force unnecessary.\\" He used his powers to lock down the prefectural system to the advantage of the royalists, by transferring or sacking twenty-two prefects. By the end of his incumbency not one prefect even slightly implicated in the events of the Hundred Days was still in office. On 18 November, he signed a statute that replaced the general staff of the National Guard with a committee of three Inspectors-General who were the members of the council of the Colonel-General  none other than the Comte d'Artois. The statute also removed the right of the other ministers to review any nominations to these positions. This permitted the Ultras to infiltrate the organisation more easily. By a statute of 13 January 1816, he shortened the terms of mayors and deputy-mayors by two years; Vaublanc explained this measure to a prefect thus: \\"By accelerating the turn-over of mayors and deputy-mayors, you must get those people out of the way who, without a formal recall, would continue in a station to which they appear ill-suited.\\" The Institut de France, of which the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise forms part In countersigning the statute of 21 March 1816, he aided the controversial reorganisation of the Institut de France, perhaps persuaded by a letter from Jean Baptiste Antoine Suard, secretary in perpetuity of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise: \\"I can never tire of repeating that there is manifest in this institute a remnant of the Revolutionary spirit, whose influence must urgently be quelled by wise foresight working through statutes which you shall put into effect\\"; this statute gave him the direct power to name nine of the eleven academicians. This radical submission of academia to \\"royal benevolence\\" met a mixed reception. In particular, the liberals reproached him for replacing the poet Antoine Vincent Arnault with the Duc de Richelieu, Pierre Louis Roederer with the Duc de L√©vis, and Charles-Guillaume Etienne with the Comte Choiseul- Gouffier. The new acad√©miciens had no significant literary achievements. This affair earned him the nickname Maupeou de la litt√©rature. Throughout this time of purging, he proposed the creation of a Ministry of Fine Arts for Chateaubriand, but this idea was turned down by the Duc de Richelieu. On 6 April 1816 Vaublanc was elected membre libre of the Academy of Fine Arts, from which he had ousted the painter Jacques-Louis David. Fall from grace In his capacity as Minister of the Interior, he had to draft a new electoral law. Vaublanc proposed, without much enthusiasm (and with the precedent of Article 37 from the Charter of 1814), an annual re-election of one fifth of the Chamber according to a two-tier system aimed at keeping the Chamber in Royalist hands. This proposal was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies, on 3 April 1816, by 89 votes to 57. Hoping to stay in power as long as possible, the Chamber tabled a counter-proposal involving a general election every five years, which in turn was rejected by the Government. As a result of the impasse, France briefly had no electoral law. On 10 April 1816, to a full house, the Police Minister Decazes heckled him: \\"You are nothing more than the Minister of the Comte d'Artois and you want to be more powerful than the Ministers of the King!\\" Vaublanc responded scathingly: \\"If I were more powerful than you, I would make full use of those powers to have you charged with high treason for you are, M. Decazes, indeed a traitor both to King and country.\\" On 13 April 1816, he aided the expulsion of some students from the Polytechnic, perpetrators of \\"disturbances and indiscipline\\", the majority in fact being Bonapartists who were being expelled for political reasons. France's allies, still present in the country, became uneasy about the dissensions within the French government. The Russian Ambassador, a Corsican named Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo, went so far as to blame Vaublanc for a large part of it: \\"One of the principal sources of the disorder has been the heterogeneous composition of the ministry; the defection of that of the Interior has greatly weakened the authority and the influence of the Crown on the Chambers.\\" The battle of personalities within the Ministry of the Interior (Vaublanc versus Richelieu and Decazes), the tight links between Vaublanc and the future Charles X, the hysterical outburst of 10 April, and Vaublanc's report to the King in which he absurdly insisted on \\"the indespensability of a firmer and more resolute pace\\" all led to his downfall. Richelieu demanded that the King dismiss Vaublanc, threatening to resign if he did not. The King finally acquiesced, and, when he asked for the statute so he could countersign it, the episode (according to the account of Louis-Mathieu Mol√©) descended into farce.Mol√©: \\"M. de Richelieu started to obey, but found that he had forgotten or lost the key to his portfolio; feeling how important it was not to let slip this opportunity, the blood rushed into his face, and, vexed beyond endurance, he finally took his portfolio in both hands, tore it in half, and extracted the statute, whereupon the King, without showing the least sign of emotion or surprise, signed the nomination of M. Lain√© to the post of Minister of the Interior.\\" Replaced by Joseph Louis Joachim Lain√© shortly after the failure of his plans for electoral reform, he left on 8 May 1816, the same day as the Minister of Justice, Fran√ßois Barb√©-Marbois, who had been sacked at the insistence of the Comte d'Artois in a tit-for-tat deal. The King recompensed Vaublanc with the titles of State Minister and Member of the Privy Council. Deputy of the chamber (1820‚Äì1827) and afterwards On 13 November 1820 he was elected to the Chamber as deputy for Calvados. He was re-elected on 10 October 1821, became a vice-president of the Chamber during the 1822 session, was re-elected again on 6 March 1824, but lost in 1827. He was at the same time selected to be deputy for Guadeloupe, where he was the co-proprietor of a sugar plantation in the parish of Basse-terre. In this capacity he recommended several changes in the judiciary and in the administration of the colonies, including the construction of storehouses. With two of his colleagues in the chamber, Comte de la Breteche and Baron de Vitrolles, he oversaw some ultra-royalist periodicals, starting with La Quotidienne and Le Drapeau Blanc. In January 1823, he came out in favour of the Spanish Expedition, and was named a member of the board of inquiry, presided over by Marshal Macdonald. He had just been reappointed to the State Council (on 25 July) with the written promise of a peerage, when the statues of July 1830 deposed Charles X. He retired from public life after the accession of Louis- Philippe and worked on his memoirs until his sight failed. He died at the age of eighty-nine, on 21 August 1845, in Paris at his house on the rue du Bac.

The design has a double outline with five curved arms enclosing several so-called 'cup' marks, the like of which can be found on other stones nearby. The design is unique in the British Isles, so its close similarity to Camunian rose designs in Italy have led some to theorise that the two are connected. In fact, the troops stationed in Ilkley during Roman occupation were recruited from the Celtic Lingones. This tribe was native to Gaul, but in around 400 BC, some migrated across the Alps to the Adriatic coast. Some believe the Ilkley Lingones were recruited from here rather than from Gaul. It is possible that the Italian Lingones passed through the Valcamonica region at some point, took on the swastika designs they found as part of their tribal symbolism, and carved it on the nearby moor when stationed in Ilkley.

It runs generally parallel to Offa's Dyke, sometimes within a few yards but never more than away. It now appears insignificant, sometimes a raised hedgerow and in other places is now no more than a cropmark, the ditch long since filled in and the bank ploughed away, but originally it was a considerable construction, considered to be strategically more sophisticated than Offa's Dyke. The date of construction is disputed, ranging from sub-Roman to the early ninth century. Construction and siting It consists of the usual bank and ditch of an ancient dyke, with the ditch on the western side, meaning that the dyke faces Wales and by implication can be seen as protecting the English lands to the east. The placement of the dyke in the terrain also shows that care was taken to provide clear views to the west and to use local features to the best defensive advantage. Dating controversy The dyke was previously thought to date to the early 8th century, constructed by Aethelbald king of Mercia who reigned from 716 to 757. Aethelbald's successor, Offa, built the dyke which carries his name at some point during his reign (757 to 796). Excavations in the 1990s at Maes-y-Clawdd near Oswestry uncovered the remains of a small fire site together with eroded shards of Romano-British pottery and quantities of charcoal, which have been dated to between 411 and 561 AD (centered around 446 AD). This evidence would seem to place the building of the dyke in the era of the post-Roman kingdom whose capital was at Wroxeter (just south of modern-day Shrewsbury) about to the east. The dating of the fire site and hence the dyke has been disputed, and it has been suggested that owing to the difficulties inherent in radiocarbon dating, this single date cannot be fully trusted and also that the dyke could easily have been built on top of the fire site at a later date. Excavations in 2006 suggested a much later date of 792‚Äì852, and the earlier date is now thought to relate to a fire site of a sub-Roman earthwork which preceded the actual dyke. It has been tentatively suggested that the likely context for construction is in the 820s, when the Mercian king Coenwulf was fighting against a resurgent Welsh threat. Wat's Dyke Way The approximate line of the earthwork is followed by the Wat's Dyke Way, a waymarked long-distance path running for from Llanymynech in Powys to Basingwerk Abbey on the River Dee near Holywell. It was opened in 2007.

This was announced by the club in March 2015Randers FC uden Borring p√• ubestemt tid, bold.dk, 9 March 2013 Two days later, he signed a contract extension on two- years. The personal reasons were shortly after being published. The problem was that Borring's wife, Kira Egsgaard Borring, had left him, and had come along with Borring's team-mate, Christian Keller. Borring went out to the medias and said that he wouldn't play for Randers once again, as long as Keller was on the team: \\"Directly asked if I want to play with him again, I can clearly answer no. One thing is, that I have lost everything for my ex- wife, especially when we got to children, but another thing is, that I have a captain, who stabbed me in the back and has violated the rules of the locker room, so I‚Äôm sad and disappointed, and I‚Äôm still in shock.\\" Randers took the captaincy from Keller as a result of his doing. The other players in the squad supported Borring. On 23 March 2016, Borring left Randers due to the romantic involvement between team-mate Christian Keller and Borring's ex-wife. Borring's coach Colin Todd revealed in June 2016, after Borring had joined Br√∏ndby IF, that he had told Keller that he had lost all of his respect for him and Keller wouldn't play for him once again as long as he was the coach. =Br√∏ndby IF= After Borring left Randers, he had bids from three Norwegian clubs and interest from Lyngby Boldklub, but signed for Br√∏ndby IF on 29 April 2016.Br√∏ndby snupper fri Borring, bold.dk, 29 April 2016 Borring could join Br√∏ndby immediately, but first play matches for the club from the coming season.

Piel became a director in 1912, turning out such box-office successes as Mann Gegen Mann (1928), Achtung! - Auto-Diebe! (1930) and Artisten (1935). His last directorial effort was 1953's Gesprengte Gitter (Elephant Fury, a.k.a. Panic), which he also produced, wrote, and starred. Early life After attending elementary school in Benrath and High School in Derendorf, Piel became a cadet in 1909 on a sailing ship, the Grand Duchess Elizabeth. In 1911, however, he finished his cadet hood and moved to Berlin in 1912 where he created the \\"Art Film Publishing House Company\\" and made, as a director, screenwriter and producer, his first feature Black Blood (1912) with Curt Goetz in the lead role. Further films followed, based on adventure and action.  Career  Piel received the nickname \\"the dynamite director\\" because of his penchant for including explosion sequences in his films. These were authentic: Piel had befriended a demolition engineer who was often commissioned to dynamite bridges and other condemned structures slated for demolition. The engineer notified Piel of these assignments in advance: Piel filmed the explosions, then inserted the footage into his films. In 1915, Piel became bored with just standing behind the camera and he started to act. The first film with him as a leading actor, ', was a science fiction adventure, where he had to deal with robots. ', 1916 included for the first time scenes with wild animals, which he had partly trained himself and which he used later in other films. Harry Piel acting in a film This was followed by a number of films between 1918‚Äì1919, in which he played the detective \\"Joe Deebs\\" eight times and with the film To the Large Unknown Quantity (1919) began to be credited by the name \\"Harry Peel\\" internationally. In 1927 he cast himself in a double role together with Marlene Dietrich in the film His Greatest Bluff. Also, in 1927 Piel married the actress Dary Holm (1897‚Äì1960), who appeared in several of his films In 1930 he directed the comedy Him or Me (1930), and many successful adventure films were to follow, such as Shade of the Underworld (1931), Johnny Steals Europe (1932), The Ship Without a Port, The Call of the Jungle (1935) and His Best Friend (1937). In 1933 Harry Piel became a patron member of the SS and also joined the NSDAP. This, however, did not avert difficulties with the Nazis, and his film Panik (1943) was banned for its all too realistic air attacks. It depicted a German hero who traps wild animals in Africa for German zoos. At the film's climax, an air-raid on a German city frees the zoo animals from their cages; when they run loose in the streets, the people are terrified and only the heroic trapper can recapture the beasts. During World War II, this film was suppressed by Reich censors who did not want the German people to believe that Germany was in danger from aerial bombardments. Seventy-two negatives of his films, nearly all his silent film, were destroyed in an air attack. After the collapse of the Third Reich, Harry Piel, who had been a sustaining member of the SS, and had at first concealed this, was sentenced to six months detention and five years professional disqualification. After his denazification, he founded \\"Ariel Film\\" in 1950 in Hamburg with which he had only moderate success. After Gesprengte Gitter (Elephant Fury, 1953), Piel withdrew from filmmaking. He died in 1963.

(1924). A Magician Among the Spirits (via archive.org) c. 1849 ‚Äì 1909 or later) was a late 19th- and early 20th-century medium and criminal. She was convicted of fraud several times in the US, and was tried for rape and fraud in London in 1901. She was described by Harry Houdini as \\"one of the most extraordinary fake mediums and mystery swindlers the world has ever known\\". Biography Although many sources claim that Ann O'Delia Diss Debar was born as Editha Salomen in Kentucky in 1849, no documentary proof exists. Another commonly reported birth name is Ann O'Delia Salomon.Michael Cantor. (2015). Herrmann the Great - A Journey through Media. USB 978-1329084834 She herself claimed to have been born in Italy in 1854, the daughter of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and his notorious mistress, the dancer Lola Montez, and that she was raised by foster parents from a young age. Her actual father, Prof. John C.F. Salomon, was a Professor of Music at Greenville Female Institute, also known as Daughters' College and now exists as the Beaumont Inn in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Ann O'Delia Diss Debar (also spelled Ann O'Delia Dis Debar) is the most frequently referenced of the many names used by her in her lifetime, including Editha Lola Montez, Della Ann O'Sullivan, Vera Ava, Madame Messant (or McGoon), Swami Viva Ananda, Laura Horos (or Swami Laura Horos) and Laura Jackson.Lewis Spence. (2003). Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology. Kessinger Publishing. p. 439. British occultist Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (1854‚Äì1918) briefly believed that she was Anna Sprengel. She apparently became involved with Victoria Claflin and Tennessee Claflin, popular exponents of spiritualism, in the 1860s and 1870s, and was a disciple of Madame Blavatsky. She claimed to be the wife of West Virginia statesman Joseph H. Diss Debar, and produced \\"spirit paintings\\" by Old Masters. She was prosecuted several times for fraud. One notable example was the case of Luther R. Marsh, a wealthy and distinguished lawyer who had studied in the law office of Daniel Webster. Diss Debar persuaded the elderly Marsh to give her his townhouse on New York's Madison Avenue; for this she was imprisoned for 6 months in June 1888 on Blackwell's Island. The magician Carl Hertz appeared at the prosecution for the Horos trial in New York. Hertz helped send Horos to jail by duplicating in court the tricks she had used in her s√©ances.Milbourne Christopher. (1969). Houdini: The Untold Story. Crowell. p. 160. Under the name Vera P. Ava, she was convicted of larceny in Illinois and sentenced March 24, 1893 to the Joliet Correctional Center (then Joliet Penitentiary) for two years. According to the New York Times, during the trial she claimed not to be the \\"famous spook priestess\\" though the article continues to say, \\"that she is Dis Debar (sic) no one doubts.\\" Soon after she emerged from prison, she married William J. McGowan, who \\"had considerable money. He died soon afterward.\\" She married Frank Dutton Jackson in Louisiana in 1899, calling herself Princess Editha Lolita. As Editha Loleta Jackson, she was expelled from New Orleans in May 1899 as a swindler. She was imprisoned for 30 days later that month.John Mulholland (1938). Beware Familiar Spirits. Scribner. pp. 251-260. After 1899, she spent some time in South Africa, calling herself Helena Horos of the College of Occult Sciences. Diss Debar and Jackson went to England, calling themselves \\"Swami Laura Horos\\" and \\"Theodore Horos\\". They set up a \\"Purity League\\" at the Theocratic Unity Temple, near Regent's Park in London, and worked as fortune tellers and diviners, advertising their services in newspapers, such as The People and the now defunct Western Morning Advertiser. They were arrested in Birkenhead in September 1901, and charged with obtaining property by false pretenses, rape and buggery. The charges seem to have arisen from decadent sexual practices at their temple in London. The couple defended themselves, but Diss Debar was sentenced to 7-years imprisonment, and her husband to 15 years. She was held in the prison in Aylesbury, released on parole in July 1906 and immediately went missing, apparently leaving England for the United States. Thereafter, she was wanted by Scotland Yard. She was next found in Cincinnati in 1909, under the name Vera Ava. In August 1909, Diss Debar attempted to start a new religious cult called the New Revelation in New York City, but abandoned the plan at the School of Mahatmas on 32nd Street one week before it was to open after journalists revealed her true identity.

The Rother Valley Railway (RVR) is a heritage railway project based at Robertsbridge in East Sussex, England. It takes its name from the original name for what later became the Kent and East Sussex Railway, running from Robertsbridge through to Headcorn in Kent, via Tenterden. The project is to replace the ‚Äòmissing link‚Äô between Robertsbridge, a station on the Tonbridge to Hastings mainline, and Bodiam on the Kent and East Sussex Railway, a heritage railway which operates from Bodiam to Tenterden. A charity supported by a society of volunteers are attempting to re-establish the railway link. The RVR began by reinstating the first few hundred yards of line eastwards from Robertsbridge, and also a short stretch westwards from Bodiam. In 2010, the latter section was further extended to reach Junction Road. In summer 2011 work began at Robertsbridge to extend further eastwards to Northbridge Street, which entailed the rebuilding of five bridges. By June 2012, this further extension was also completed. In September 2013, a Gala weekend at Robertsbridge marked the progress to date and the start of the next phase - the re-instatement of the section between Northbridge Street and Junction Road, for which statutory permissions are being sought. While the RVR does not yet feature regular passenger trains, the base at Robertsbridge houses a small shop and visitor centre open to the public each Sunday, utilising a building formerly used as the London terminus of the Orient Express. There is also a small collection of historic railway vehicles in various stages of preservation. Origins The Kent & East Sussex Railway Preservation Society was formed in 1961 following closure of the line by British Railways. After many trials and tribulations, the Tenterden Railway Company Limited was incorporated in 1971 as a Company limited by guarantee and in 1973 was successful in purchasing that part of the line between Tenterden and Bodiam. The Tenterden Railway Company is now known as The Kent & East Sussex Railway (K&ESR;), as of January 2004. The preservationists wanted to reopen the line through to Robertsbridge, but were refused permission by the then Transport Minister Barbara Castle to take over the section between Bodiam and Robertsbridge, despite taking the Minister to the High Court. The latter section was lifted and became abandoned in the mid 1970s. The reason for this refusal was the Ministry plan to build a by-pass to take the A21 around Robertsbridge. K&ESR; focussed efforts on the eastern end of the line. Trains first ran again on the Kent & East Sussex Railway on 3 February 1974 between Tenterden to Rolvenden, the line gradually being restored and extended in stages, reaching Wittersham Road in 1977, Northiam in 1990 and finally Bodiam on 2 April 2000, exactly 100 years to the day since the original opening of the line to passengers. A separate Company, the Rother Valley Railway (East Sussex) Ltd, was formed on 22 May 1991 with the approval of the Tenterden Railway Company to reconstruct the railway between Bodiam and Robertsbridge and has since simplified its name to Rother Valley Railway Ltd. The plan is that K&ESR; will operate this extended railway once completed, as its constitution provides. Achievements Since 1991, the Rother Valley Railway has been acquiring parts of the trackbed as and when possible. Negotiations continue with two remaining landowners to secure the remainder of the route. Planning permission was secured for its scheme at Robertsbridge, and the whole route is safeguarded in the Council's local plan. Liaison continues with the relevant authorities. From 2009 to 2010 the RVR with help from K&ESR; and volunteers were able to complete the extension westwards from near Bodiam station, through Quarry Farm, to the B2244 (Junction Road). The first official train ran on the weekend of 19/20 March 2011. Attention then focussed on extending from Robertsbridge to Northbridge Street, and this was followed by work to recast the Robertsbridge section in readiness for the planned eventual join-up with K&ESR;'s track, once the necessary permissions have been obtained and construction completed. A gala weekend in 2013 saw a steam passenger train operating at Robertsbridge for the first time since the early 1960s, running up to Northbridge Street. December 2016 saw the reconnection of the RVR to the Network Rail system some 50 years after closure. Planning permission to reinstate the final section eastwards from Northbridge Street to Junction Road was granted in 2017. RVR applied to the Secretary of State for a Transport and Works Act Order on 19 April 2018. Many representations for and against the scheme were submitted, and in June the Secretary of State for Transport announced that a public local inquiry would be held. This inquiry is scheduled to begin on 26 May 2020, following which the Inspector will submit a report to the Secretary of State, with recommendations. The application will then be decided by the Secretary of State. In Spring 2019 work began to prepare the former trackbed between Austen's Bridge and Junction Road for tracklaying. This section was acquired by RVR, leaving just two stretches still to be acquired. A small collection of rolling stock is stored at Robertsbridge, with several items undergoing active restoration. The RVR also owns a steam locomotive, Charwelton, which has been working on the K&ESR; but is currently under overhaul. Rolling stock The following locomotives are on site *\\"Titan\\", a Drewry shunter, Vulcan Foundry works number D140. *\\"Dougal\\", a Drewry shunter, Vulcan Foundry works number D77 pic. * D2112, an ex-BR class 03 shunter. In addition are a number of other wagons and carriages undergoing or awaiting restoration. Future plans The Rother Valley Railway proposes to restore the missing rail link between Bodiam and Robertsbridge. This is approximately a long section. There will be an end-on link with the Kent and East Sussex at Bodiam enabling through running. Trains will run into the Rother Valley Railway's own new station at Robertsbridge, the platform for which is now completed, together with a toilet block forming part of the planned new station building. The railway was reconnected to the Network Rail (NR) mainline in December 2016 to permit stock transfers, and use of the RVR by NR plant for training and other purposes. Several bridges need to be rebuilt between Northbridge Street and Junction Road, and three road crossings made, including the A21 Robertsbridge by-pass. The proposal to build this road was the major reason preventing the acquisition of this section of the railway by the Tenterden Railway Company in the 1960s, and the railway land was subsequently sold off to local farmers. There has been some resistance from two landowners with regard to the proposed reinstatement, while the third section of route adjoining Junction Road has now been acquired by RVR Ltd. On 16 March 2017, Rother District Council granted planning permission for the reinstatement of the line between Northbridge Street and Junction Road. In 2018, the RVR applied for a Transport and Works Act order which, if approved, would give the statutory powers to complete the reinstatement of the line and operate it. See also * Kent and East Sussex Railway * Colonel Stephens * From 1988 until the early 1990s, another \\"Rother Valley Railway\\" had a brief existence on the site of station near the River Rother in South Yorkshire. The line had three locomotives on loan, a five-ton steam crane and a membership of over eighty. Although the line featured in a two-page article in The Railway Magazine in 1990, little seems to have happened and the society faded away. After many years details have been published stating that the society was unable to gain agreement with the necessary local authorities, so was unable to proceed. They sought another opportunity elsewhere, which they found by taking over Cleethorpes Council's struggling miniature railway, turning it into the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway in 1991.

For example, if it is believed that the decisions of sending at least one child to public school and that of voting in favor of a school budget are correlated (both decisions are binary), then the multivariate probit model would be appropriate for jointly predicting these two choices on an individual-specific basis. This approach was initially developed by Siddhartha Chib and Edward Greenberg. Example: bivariate probit In the ordinary probit model, there is only one binary dependent variable Y and so only one latent variable Y^* is used. In contrast, in the bivariate probit model there are two binary dependent variables Y_1 and Y_2, so there are two latent variables: Y^*_1 and Y^*_2 . It is assumed that each observed variable takes on the value 1 if and only if its underlying continuous latent variable takes on a positive value: : Y_1 = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if }Y^*_1>0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}, \\\\end{cases} : Y_2 = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if }Y^*_2>0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}, \\\\end{cases} with : \\\\begin{cases} Y_1^* = X_1\\\\beta_1+\\\\varepsilon_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y_2^* = X_2\\\\beta_2+\\\\varepsilon_2 \\\\end{cases} and : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\varepsilon_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\mid X \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N} \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&\\\\rho\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho&1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) Fitting the bivariate probit model involves estimating the values of \\\\beta_1,\\\\ \\\\beta_2, and \\\\rho .

Multivariate Probit For the general case, \\\\mathbf{y_i} = (y_1, ..., y_j), \\\\ (i = 1,...,N) where we can take j as choices and i as individuals or observations, the probability of observing choice \\\\mathbf{y_i} is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{y_i}\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) = & \\\\int_{A_J}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{A_1}f_N(\\\\mathbf{y}^*_i\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) dy^*_1\\\\dots dy^*_J \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{y_i}\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) = & \\\\int \\\\mathbb{1}_{y^* \\\\in A} f_N(\\\\mathbf{y}^*_i\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) d\\\\mathbf{y}^*_i \\\\end{align} Where A = A_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times A_J and, : A_j = \\\\begin{cases} (-\\\\infty,0] & y_j^* = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (0, \\\\infty) & y^*_j = 1 \\\\end{cases} The log-likelihood function in this case would be \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\log\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{y_i}\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) Except for J\\\\leq2 typically there is no closed form solution to the integrals in the log-likelihood equation. Instead simulation methods can be used to simulated the choice probabilities. Methods using importance sampling include the GHK algorithm (Geweke, Hajivassilou, McFadden and Keane), AR (accept-reject), Stern's method. There are also MCMC approaches to this problem including CRB (Chib's method with Rao-Blackwellization), CRT (Chib, Ritter, Tanner), ARK (accept- reject kernel), and ASK (adaptive sampling kernel).. A variational approach scaling to large datasets is proposed in Probit-LMM (Mandt, Wenzel, Nakajima et al.).

Meelick () is a small village in County Clare, Ireland, situated a few kilometres north of Limerick in the Mid-West Region. History From 1956, the area was home to 161 Hungarian refugees fleeing the Soviet repression in that country (see 1956 Hungarian Revolution). They were housed in Knockalisheen Camp, a disused army barracks dating from the Emergency.D√°il Debate on Hungarian Refugees, 1957 In 1957, complaints and disputes between the refugees and the authorities over living conditions and enforced idleness led to a mass hunger strike. After three days, the D√°il and the Irish Red Cross negotiated an end to the strike. By the summer of 1958, most of the refugees were allowed to move to Germany and the USA while a few chose to remain in Ireland. During their stay at the camp, the 51 children attended the local St Munchin's Girls' School where they were taught both the English and Irish languages. Since the 1990s the camp has again been used to house asylum seekers, now mostly from African countries. Community The village has a local GAA club and other local amenities such as a community centre, tavern, and shop. Historically the village of Meelick was located in an area commonly known as Stonepark, where the church and school are situated. However, during the early 1980s, the development of housing estates began where the majority of Meelick residents now live. Before this, Meelick didn't even warrant a place on the map and even with the development of new housing and the resulting population boost, Meelick can still be seen on very few maps. The three main housing estates built were Ballycannon Heights, Elton Court and Kylevoher. With the turn of the 20th century, two new estates, Elmwood and Glen Abhainn were developed. Other residential areas near Meelick include Cappantymore, Moneen, Stonepark (the original village location), Woodcock Hill and Ballycannon North.

It functions as a think-tank, library, non-profit consulting firm for the courts, advocate for judicial and legislative reform, and a center of education in the field of judicial administration.National Center for State Courts Mission The NCSC's mission is to improve judicial administration in the courts of the United States and courts throughout the entire world. To accomplish this goal, the NCSC acts as a non-profit provider of many services to the courts including: research studies, consulting, a variety of educational programs, an extensive web database of information on court administration, the largest library of materials on court administration in the world, and continued assistance in the improvement of inter-branch relations through its lobbying and advocacy services.National Center for State Courts History In March 1971, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Warren E. Burger, called for the creation of a central resource for the state and local courts at the First National Conference of the Judiciary, in Williamsburg, VA. This conference, attended by the President, Chief Justice, and Attorney General of the U.S. in addition to over 400 other members of the legal community, was the largest and most diverse group to come together to discuss judicial administration in the state courts. It was a reflection of the continuing difficulties faced in the nation's courts during the tenure of the previous Chief Justice, Earl Warren, recognized by both Chief Justice Burger and then-President Richard Milhous Nixon. While the more popular Chief Justice has been widely credited with the first call for the creation of such a resource, in fact, President Nixon was the first to express his support for a central resource for the state and local courts during his opening remarks, which actually occurred the day before Burger's announcement.Low, Erick. The National Center for State Courts: A Commemorative History of Its Structure and Organization in Honor of 20 Years of Service to the State Courts. Williamsburg, VA: National Center for State Courts: April 1991. p. 3 Nixon noted the significance of the already existent Federal Judicial Center to the nation's federal courts; stating that it was long-overdue for the state courts to have a similar resource. Chief Justice Burger issued his call for a permanent central resource for the state and local courts on the following day. Entrance sign for the NCSC Structure and divisions The NCSC is divided into three primary offices in the United States, with satellite offices appearing internationally depending on project assignments. Headquarters, in Williamsburg, VA, houses the Research and Technology Services, Knowledge and Information Services (KIS), Association Management, Communications and Publications, and the Institute for Court Management (Education) divisions. It serves as the primary hub and meeting point for all the Center's various activities and houses the NCSC's library which contains the largest known collection of court-administration materials. There are two smaller permanent offices, one in Denver, CO which houses the Court Consulting Services Division; and another in Arlington, VA which houses the Government Relations and International Programs divisions.National Center for State Courts Notes and references Category:Courts in the United States Category:Legal organizations based in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Williamsburg, Virginia Category:Think tanks based in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1971 Category:1971 establishments in Virginia ","title":"National Center for State Courts"},{"id":"8870857","text":"Nola is a genus of moths described by William Elford Leach in 1815.

Sonnenfeld, and David Naguib Pellow . It is published by Temple University Press. In three parts, the book looks at global electronics, environmental justice and labor rights, and electronic waste and extended producer responsibility. In four appendices, the book also deals with the principles of environmental justice, the computer take-back campaign, sample shareholder resolutions, and the electronics recycler's pledge of true stewardship. This 357-page book was put together by \\"scores of people around the world (who) have been involved over the course of several years in the conceptualization, development, editing and production (of it)\\".  \\"New wave of technology\\"  In his Foreword to the text, former Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower makes out a case to explain how \\"technology happens\\". He writes: \\"Take cars. After Henry Ford began mass production, it took only a flash in time for these four-wheeled chunks of technology to wholly transform our landscape, environment, economy, culture, psychology, and ... well, pretty much our whole world. For better or worse, cars created freeways, shopping malls, McDonald's, drive-in banking  even the Beach Boys!\\" Hightower argues: \\"A new wave of technology is sweeping the land. It is embodied in the tiny chips (and the computers they power) that are radically and rapidly transforming our world  and, like the automobile, not always for the better.\\" He also contends that the story of the \\"dark side of the chip\\" needs to be \\"told and retold\\" across the \\"global village\\" before it is too late to do anything about it. The book narrates the story of how the high-tech industry grew in the \\"Valley of Heart's Delight\\" (before the place got renamed to Silicon Valley) and how Santa Clara Valley fruit-processing workers such as Alida Hernandez got reinvented into \\"clean room\\" workers. This \\"deplorable pattern is still being replicated around the world\\".  Stories of electronic workers suffering toxic exposures  The book contains stories about electronic workers suffering toxic exposures and fighting over it. From the Southwestern US and the Maquiladora region on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, to Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, China, and India. The book argues that \\"far too (words) have been addressed to the downside of the (electronics industry's) revolution\\". Its co-editors, in a signed article titled \\"The Quest for Sustainability and Justice in a High-Tech World\\", say: \\"Although most consumers are eager to enjoy their latest electronic games, few relate the declining prices of these and other electronic technologies to the labor of Third World women, who are paid pennies a day.\\" Other issues focused on by the co-editors include environmental degradation, occupational health hazards, and the \\"widespread ignorance\\" of the \\"health and ecological footprints of the global electronics industry\\". There are problems of contamination by hi-tech manufacturing (of workers, air, land and water) from all around  Silicon Valley in the United States, Silicon Glen in Scotland, Silicon Island in Thailand, and Silicon Paddy in China. It contrasts the reality between the \\"CEOs and upper management\\" drawing \\"multimillion dollar salaries and 'golden parachutes'\\" as against the reality of the production workers living in packed dormitories and often facing sweatshop conditions.  Unsung heroines and heroes  While acknowledging the work of the hi-tech revolution pioneers, the book's editors also points to the \\"accomplishments of the unsung heroines and heroes of this revolution's other side\\". Including Santa Clara Center for Occupational Safety and Health founder Amanda Hawes; San Jose, California housewife Lorraine Ross, who battled against Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation's polluting practices in Silicon Valley; Thai occupational health physician Orapan Metadilogkul who confronted Seagate Corporation; and Scottish semiconductor worker Helen Clark \\"who gave her life fighting to provide a voice for poisoned workers of National Semiconductor's plant in Silicon Glen\\".  Globalisation of electronics, labor rights, product end-of-life  Its editors say the book has \\"two geographical frames of reference\\"‚Äîthe vicinity of San Jose, California (or, Silicon Valley), and \\"parts of the world increasingly integrated into global networks of electronics production, consumption, and disposal\\". The volume looks at three \\"broad, integrative themes\\": the globalization of electronics manufacturing; labor rights and environmental justice; and the product end-of-life cycle issues (e-waste, and extended producer responsibility). In terms of global electronics, the book focuses on Silicon Valley (where the United States electronics industry's roots lie, and which has a three-decade history of community and worker dialog and struggle). It also looks at electronics manufacturing in China, India, Thailand, and Central and Eastern Europe. In terms of labor rights and \\"environmental justice\\", the book looks at the stories of workers and environmentalists taking up such issues  \\"work hazards, antiunion hostility, and environmental health perils\\"‚Äîin countries that range from the United States, to Mexico, Scotland, and Thailand, among others. E-waste issues get looked at in the context of trading or dumping from the North to South. \\"But as nations like India and China increasingly modernize, their own industries and consumers are contributing to the problems as well,\\" says the editors.  Failed to keep pace with social and environmental advances  They argue that while the electronics industry leaders have produced \\"enormous technical innovation over the years\\", they have failed to keep \\"sufficient pace with the socially and environmentally oriented advances that are available to them.\\" In their chapter titled \\"The Quest for Sustainability\\", the co-editors suggest that sustainability, environmental justice and labor rights \\"cannot lie solely in the hands of either the social movements or the captains of industry or the representatives of the state\\". Instead, it suggests, all citizens and stakeholders must play a role in shaping the industry, its workers, and the environment wherever communities get affected.  \\"Downside not addressed\\"  Says an introduction to its contents: \\"Of the millions of words written over the past several decades about the electronics industry's incredible transformation of our world, far too few have been addressed (to) the downside of this revolution. Many are surprised to learn that environmental degradation and occupational health hazards are as much a part of high-tech manufacturing as miniaturization and other such marvels\\".  Third World women's labor, pollute surroundings  The editors also comment: \\"Although most consumers are eager to enjoy their latest computers, televisions, cellular phones, iPods, and electronic games, few relate the declining prices of these and other electronic technologies to the labor of Third World women, who are paid pennies a day. Fewer still realize that the amazingly powerful microprocessors and superminiaturized, high-capacity memory devices harm the workers who produce them and pollute the surrounding communities' air and water\\".  Comments on the book  Sandra Steingraber calls this book \\"essential reading for anyone who owns a cell phone or a computer\\" and says \\"our digital possessions connect us not only to global information but also to global contamination and injustice\\". Nicholas Ashford calls the work \\"an impressive, comprehensive critique and hopeful, but realistic, blueprint for transforming the global electronics industry into a sustainable one encompassing technological advance, environmental improvement, and equitable, safe, and secure employment\\". Jan Mazurek says that \\"contrary to high tech's clean image, this pioneering work illustrates the industry's environmental and economic downsides from the birthplace of Silicon Valley to the four corners of the globe to which the industry recently has spread\\". Mazurek comments that this book is \\"told from the compelling and passionate perspective of workers and activists involved in these struggles\\".  Regions covered  Chapters of the book cover \\"Made in China\\" electronics workers, Thailand's electronic sector's corporate social responsibility, electronic workers in India, workers in and around Central and Eastern Europe's semiconductor plants (Russia, Belarus, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Romania), Silicon Valley's Toxics' Coalition and workers' struggles, Mexico, Taiwan's Hsinchu Science Park, other issues from Taiwan, high-tech pollution in Japan, the electronic waste trade, e-waste in Delhi, producer responsibility laws in Sweden and Japan, among other themes.

BNP government increased the age of chief justice retirement in unconstitutional way to bias the appointment of the head of the caretaker government. CTG manages the government during the interim 90-day period and parliamentary elections. Political conflict began with the alleged appointment of a Chief Advisor, a role which devolved to the President, Dr. Iajuddin Ahmed. The interim period was marked from the beginning by violent protests initiated by the Awami League, with 40 people killed and hundreds injured in the first month. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party had its own complaints about the process and the opposition. After extensive negotiations as the CTG tried to bring all the political parties to the table and had agreement for a scheduled election, on 3 January 2007, the Awami League said that it and the smaller parties of its Grand Alliance would boycott the general election to be held on 22 January 2007. They complained about the lack of an accurate voters list. More widespread violence and political rioting followed. The \\"bitter rivalry\\" between the Awami League and BNP has affected the nation for the last two decades, although their political positions are not so far apart. The parties are led by women who represent assassinated leaders: Sheikh Hasina, the eldest daughter of father of the nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, since 1981 has been head of the Awami League. Khaleda Zia, the head of the BNP, is the widow of a late president Ziaur Rahman, who as President founded the party in the late 1970s. On 11 January 2007 the military intervened to support the caretaker government of President Iajuddin, who had already declared a state of emergency. He accepted the resignations of most of his advisors. He also resigned as Chief Advisor, being replaced on 12 January by Fakhruddin Ahmed, who had worked for the World Bank. The government suppressed political activity to try to restore stability. In the spring, it started to work on corruption cases, charging 160 persons, including both party leaders, other politicians, civil servants and businessmen for actions going back to the late 1990s. The nation has had an extreme reputation for corruption under both the major political parties. In addition, some observers speculated that the caretaker government was trying to force both party leaders into exile to stabilise the country and reduce the political polarisation. The CTG also charged Sheikh Hasina for alleged murder for the deaths of four persons during protests in the fall of 2006. The High Court held that Khaleda Zia could not be charged under emergency law for events that happened prior to the emergency but on appeal, in September 2007 the Bangladesh Supreme Court ruled that the Zia trial should proceed. Near the end of 2008, the caretaker government moved to restore democratic government and held elections in December. The Awami League and Grand Alliance won by a two-thirds majority, and formed a government in 2009. Background According to Bangladesh's unique system, at the time of national parliamentary elections, which must be held within ninety days of dissolving a parliament, a caretaker government is entrusted to oversee the process and manage in the interim. First established in an informal way, the CTG provisions were incorporated by amendment in 1996 into the constitution. It stipulates that the Chief Advisor position (with the status of Prime Minister) is filled by the appointment of the last retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He appoints a maximum of ten advisors (with the status of ministers) to assist in managing the government. The caretaker government runs all the state's affairs during the 90-day interim, including conducting the nationwide parliamentary elections. During this interim period, the Defense Ministry's charge is transferred to the country's President of Bangladesh, who assumes the role of Commander-in-Chief.  Protests  At the end of BNP's 2001‚Äì2006 term, the Awami League questioned the neutrality of K. M. Hasan, the immediate past Chief Justice, who was in line to become Chief Advisor of the caretaker government. With uncertainty about who would be appointed as CA, Awami supporters led protests and violence beginning on 28 October, which resulted in 40 deaths and hundreds of injuries in the first month.\\"Opposition welcomes B'desh U-turn\\" , BBC News, 26 April 2007. Caretaker government is formed At the backdrop against the situation, the former Chief Justice K. M. Hasan declined to take the job of Chief Advisor (CA), citing health reasons. However, according to the provision, the constitutional obligations must be performed without fear and favour. Hindering this sacred responsibility is deemed to be serious violation of the constitution, which is to be punished in highest order. According to a BDNews24 report based on later Wikileaks, Justice Hasan had started recruiting advisors before he was sworn in. President Iajuddin Ahmed directed his Presidential Advisor to organise meetings with the four major political parties representing parliament, but the parties were unable to agree on an appointment for Chief Advisor, although five men were considered. Justice Mainur Reza Chowdhury was discussed as a nominee, but he died before appointment. Two retired justices of the Supreme Court: Justice M. A. Aziz and Justice Hamidul Haq, were also considered. Aziz was Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) at that time. The Awami League complained about him in that position, so did not accept him for CA. Justice Haq was disqualified as he had been appointed Chairman of the Judicial Training Institute by the immediate past BNP government. Having held a for-profit office is a disqualification for the CA. In addition, BNP opposed his nomination as CA. Justice Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury was considered. He had retired before Mainur Reza Chowdhury. The BNP opposed him, as the Parliamentary Adviser of Khaleda Zia was against him. In August 2012, The Daily Star reported that Khaleda Zia has said she regretted having opposed Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury's appointment at the time. Given the parties' failure to agree on a candidate, according to the constitution the position devolved to the President, Iajuddin Ahmed, serving since 2002. He took it on in addition to his regular responsibilities, which under the caretaker government included the Defense Ministry. Iajuddin Ahmed formed a government, appointing ten advisors to a council to act as ministers. He appointed his press spokesman, the journalist Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, as his chief Presidential Advisor, with the status of Minister of State. Chowdhury had the responsibility to negotiate with the political parties to bring them to participation in the election. The Awami League agreed to take part in the elections, but demanded that Iajuddin Ahmed make mass changes to the administration to free it from what they called the BNP's politicisation. They also demanded that a new and accurate voter list be compiled. The BNP also had its own issues against the opposition. Hussain Muhammad Ershad, head of the Jatiya Party allied with BNP, asked the CTG not to extend date of submission of nominations for candidates, as requested by Awami League, as his candidates had filed on time. At Sheikh Hasina's demand, a presidential advisor negotiated with the Election Commission to gain a two-day extension for filing of nominations\\"Election extension for filing nominations\\", Daily Star, 30 November 2006 On 23 December 2006, all political parties joined the planned elections of 22 January 2007. The last day of nomination filing was extended to 26 December 2006 to accommodate all political parties, as requested by Sheikh Hasnna to Mukhles Chowdhury. On 3 January 2007, the last day possible, the Awami League declared that they and their allies would boycott the election. The withdrawal added to the political uncertainty and more violent protests resulted, in which hundreds had already been injured. These actions had devastating, disruptive effects on the economy. As the BBC noted, > \\"The two women [Hasina and Zia] are bitter rivals and barely speak to each > other. Their mutual loathing is reflected among their respective sets of > supporters. Bangladesh is one of the most politically polarised countries in > the world, even though the actual policy differences between the two largest > parties do not amount to anything significant. But the ceaseless bickering > and violent confrontations have meant that the Bangladeshi economy ‚Äì already > fragile ‚Äì is coming under further pressure.\\" Military intervention Military representatives met with President Ahmed on 11 January, urging him to declare a state of emergency, and to resign and appoint an Interim Chief Advisor. According to a United States diplomatic cable later released under Wikileaks, the Army Chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, and his group persuaded the President to declare a state of emergency on 11 January 2007.Ishaan Tharoor, \\"General Command\\" , Time Magazine, 19 June 2008 At the time, the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence & Counterterrorism, Brigadier General A T M Amin, met with the US Ambassador, Patricia Butenis, to explain the military's concerns. Given the Awami League's withdrawal from the elections, they believed that supporting a one-sided election might threaten the armed forces continued participation in UN peacekeeping missions ‚Äì UNPKO, which they valued. In addition, they were worried about threatened terrorist violence from Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), which had set off 300 bombs in August 2005. They wanted a neutral government established until \\"fair, free and credible elections\\" could be held in which all parties participated. In the near term, Justice Fazlul Haque, the senior CTG advisor, was to be appointed Interim Chief Advisor, and Fakhruddin Ahmed, a prominent banker, would quickly be appointed Chief Advisor to replace Iajuddin Ahmed. All of them were the violation of the constitution and when chief advisor or prime minister resigns the whole advisory council or cabinet is deemed to be resigned what Advisor Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury categorically pointed out. Mukhles Chowdhury also deleted some sentences, which were derogated remarks against the country to justify the military intervention, written by Lt. Gen. Moeen in the president's speech broadcast on 11 January 2011. Moeen's main pillar of 11 January 2007 military coup was then Military Secretary to the President (MSP) Major General Aminul Karim. Due to this, Advisor Mukhles Chowdhury attempted to replace him by then General Officer Commanding (GOC) of 24 Division Major General Md Abdul Mubeen, who was later appointed as army chief by successive government. Unfortunately, DG of Special Security Force (SSF) Major General Syed Fatemi Ahmed Rumi supported Aminul Karim and misled former prime minister Khaleda Zia on this. Initially. Mrs Zia was convinced by Advisor Chowdhury, but later she took side of Rumi. But what she did not realise that once loyal this army officer had already betrayed with her. Although Rumi was posted long five years of Khaleda Zia's tenure with her, she was under surveillance by him as well. During those days, he intercepted her personal life. Ironically, an army group including him, tried to publish a Nikahnama (marriage document) of his once boss in Prothom Alo, a bangla daily. Fatemi Rumi accompanied General Moeen to his maiden visit to India, he was posted by Moeen to Rangpur division of army where Moeen visite three times and worked to establish a University in Rangpur. Moreover, Rumi pressured businessmen to contribute donation for the Kings Party \\"Jago Bangladesh\\" a political party created by Moeen, which dies a natural death. Likewise, when Mukhles Chowdhury informed top politicians that by 12 January 2011 there would be a martial law in Bangladesh, Brigadier Chowdhury Fazlul Bari misled Khaleda Zia with the help of Aminul Karim to implement Moeen's plan to capture Presidency. In addition, Amin (popularly known as Bihari Amin as he was a settler from India's Bihar Province) informed the US diplomats that the Director General for National Security Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Md. Rezzaqul Haider Chowdhury (Haider), was relieved from duty and being investigated. (Later that year, he was charged in the 10-Truck Arms and Ammunition Haul in Chittagong, an incident of smuggling to a militant organisation based in India.) The President's remaining CTG advisor, M Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, was also relieved of his duties. The cable noted that both men were believed to be paths of influence from Khaleda Zia and the BNP. Assuring the diplomats of the military's support for the civilian government, Amin said their immediate goals for the caretaker government were to: *\\"reconstitute the election commission, *develop a credible voter list, and *establish a roadmap to free and fair elections.\\" It also wanted the interim government to tackle corruption and economic reform. =Cessation of election monitoring operations= The BBC reported on 11 January 2007 that, given the withdrawal of the Awami League, and announced resignations, the United Nations and the European Union immediately suspended their election monitoring operations, as conditions for a credible vote did not exist. The EU said, > \\"The European Commission has decided to suspend its Election Observation > Mission (EOM) to Bangladesh covering the parliamentary elections on 22nd > January. The European Commission has recalled the long-term observers > already on the ground, and will not deploy the other phases of its > observation mission, which was due to be led by MEP Alexander Graf > Lambsdorff.\\" A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, > \\"The political crisis in Bangladesh has severely jeopardised the legitimacy > of the electoral process. The announced cancellation of numerous > international observation missions is regrettable. The United Nations has > had to suspend all technical support to the electoral process, including by > closing its International Coordination Office for Election Observers in > Dhaka.\\" =State of emergency= On the same day as the UN and EU withdrawal, Chief Advisor Iajuddin Ahmed announced a state of emergency in Bangladesh. He established a late night to early morning (11 p.m. to 5 am) curfew. The Economist reported this action as a form of coup d'√©tat.The coup that dare not speak its name , The Economist Within hours President Ahmed announced his resignation as chief advisor and postponed the scheduled election. Prior to his resignation, he accepted the resignations of nine of the ten advisors of the caretaker government. President Ahmed appointed Justice Fazlul Haque, the senior-ranking CTG advisor, as the interim Chief Advisor. The columnist Zafar Sobhan of the Daily Star newspaper wrote, \\"It is fairly apparent that it was done under pressure from the army because of the threat that the country could lose its peacekeeping role\\" with the United Nations, which was both prestigious and lucrative in terms of payment to the country.\\"Bangladesh army calling the shots amid turmoil: analysts\\", Daily Star, 14 January 2007 On 12 January 2007, with military backing, the former Bangladesh Bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed, who had worked for the World Bank, was sworn in as the new Chief Advisor. He appointed five advisors on 13 January to form the new interim government. When he was officially named as the head of the caretaker government, he lifted the curfew.\\"The news of new CA taking over\\" , BDNews24 The state of emergency was continued, suspending some basic rights provided by the constitution, such as the freedom of movement, assembly, and speech to limit protests and disruptive political activity.\\"State of emergency report\\" , BBC =Corruption and murder charges= In 2007, the caretaker government pursued graft and corruption charges against both major party leaders and some of their senior staff, trying to clean up the country, which was notorious for corruption. It filed charges against 160 politicians, civil servants, and businessmen, including Tareque and Arafat Rahman, two sons of the former prime minister, Khaleda Zia, who were both active in the BNP. Later in the year, the government filed charges of corruption against both her and Sheikh Hasina, leader of the Awami League. This anti-corruption effort was greeted with approval by the people, who were tired of government officials \\"siphoning off the country's wealth.\\"\\"Opposition welcomes B'desh U-turn\\" , BBC News, 26 April 2006, accessed 29 April 2013 In April, the media reported that the caretaker government was trying to force both major party leaders out of the country, which was needed to reform the political system. Supporters of Khaleda Zia were negotiating for her to go to Saudi Arabia, but that country declined. The CTG banned Sheikh Hasina from returning from a trip and had prohibited political activity. By 26 April 2007, the government had changed its position, and allowed Hasina to return and both leaders to resume political activities. Hasina was being charged with murder for the deaths of four opposition supporters in late 2006, allegedly due to attacks by her party members, prior to the state of emergency being imposed. On 12 July 2007, Sheikh Hasina, party leader of the Awami League, was arrested for graft, based on charges filed by a businessman against her for actions in 1998.\\"Former Bangladesh premier Sheikh Hasina arrested\\", Hindustan Times (New Delhi, India), 16 July 2007, accessed 29 April 2013 =Restoration of parliamentary democracy= After holding power for more than a year, the CTG decided to hold local elections in some locations on 4 August 2008. The main parties criticised this as unconstitutional. General elections were held on 29 December 2008, when the Awami League and its Grand Alliance won two-thirds of the seats in parliament.

The Islamic Sites of Mosul, Iraq, are of varied ages, the oldest being the Umayyad Mosque from 640 AD. and the modern being the Mosul Grand Mosque. The following mosques and shrines were destroyed by Islamic State (also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh) in 2014, after their takeover of the city: Prophet Yunus (also known as the tomb of Jonah); Prophet Jerjis; Mashad Yahya Abul Kassem; Prophet Seth; Prophet Daniel; Hamu-al-Qadu. Mosul Grand Mosque The largest mosque of Mosul in Iraq. It was previously called Saddam Mosque in the name of the Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. It is situated in the Taqafah district bordering the Tigris river near the Nineveh archeological site. Its construction started during the Saddam Hussein regime, but works were interrupted because of the political instability in the country and it remains incomplete to this day. Reportedly the United Arab Emirates offered to finance the completion of the mosque on condition of the mosque being renamed Zayed Mosque in the name of the UAE Emir Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan but the offer was refused. Great Mosque of Nur al-Din The Great Mosque was originally built under Nur al-Din al-Zangi Atabeg of Damascus, who occupied Mosul in 1170 after taking control from his brother Saif el Din Ghazi bin Qutb al-Din al Zingi. It may have been a development of a previous Mosque. All that remains from this complex are the minaret, two mihrabs, an inscribed marble slab, and some stucco decoration. The elaborate 52‚Ä≤ (15.5m) brick minaret that leans like the Tower of Pisa is called Al-Hadba (The Humped). The Great Mosque was destroyed 21 June 2017, in what Iraqi forces claim to be by ISIL. Mosque of the Prophet Jonah Prophet Yunus Mosque On one of the two most prominent mounds of Nineveh's ruins, rose the Mosque of the prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai. When built, the mosque replaced an Assyrian Church believed to be the burial place of Jonah and called Jonah's Tomb. Also, Assyrian King Esarhaddon (681‚Äì669 BC) previously built a palace on the site. This shrine on the site of a Christian church was a short distance away from the built-up walls and gates of Nineveh. In the middle of the mosque stood a sepulcher, covered with a Persian carpet of silk and silver, and at the four corners, great copper candlesticks with wax tapers, besides several lamps and ostrich eggshells that hung down from the roof. A whale's tooth, appropriate to Jonah's well-known adventure at sea, was said to be preserved there. A saint named Sheikh Rashid Lolan was also buried at the mosque under a domed tomb. It was one of the most important mosques in Mosul and one of the few historic mosques in the east side of the city. On 24 July 2014, the building was blown up by the Islamic State, damaging several nearby houses. They stated \\"the mosque had become a place for apostasy, not prayer.\\" In March 2017, after ISIS was driven out, a system of tunnels about one kilometre long were found under the mosque. Although all moveable items had been removed there were still Assyrian reliefs, structures and carvings along the walls. Green Mosque The Green Mosque dates back to 12th century AD, and is distinguished for its beautiful dome and elaborately wrought mihrab. It is also known as the Al-Khidr Mosque.

It contained the tomb of Imam al-Baher, which was situated next to the prayer hall. The door to the shrine was made by blue marbles, and the ledges made of marble had the Throne Verse of the Qur'an inscribed on it. A mihrab existed to the south of the tomb, and it was also made of blue marbles and adorned with the Qur'anic verses. The prayer hall was topped by a green 17 meters dome.

Hema Kado Mosque, an Ottoman-era mosque in Mosul's central square, also known as Hamu Al-Qadu Mosque or Mosque of the Pasha and dating from 1881 was destroyed by Islamic State, because it contained the tomb of ‚ÄõAla‚Äô al-Din ibn ‚ÄõAbd al-Qadir al-Kaylani that was visited every Thursday and Friday by local Muslims.  Mosque of Al-Muhsin  It was a historic mosque in Mosul, Iraq. It was located in Al-Shifa' neighborhood, near the Bash Tapia Castle and in front of the Mausoleum of Yahya Abu al-Qasim. The mosque was initially built as a madrasa known as Madrasa al-Nouri, which was commissioned by the Seljuk ruler Nour ad-Din ibn Ezzadeen in the late-12th century. It became a mausoleum after refurbishment by the Zangid ruler Badr al-Din Lu'lu'. He turned one of the rooms into a shrine and mausoleum of Imam Muhsin, and added a musholla (prayer space) and a minbar. The mausoleum was destroyed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant in 2015 after an attempt to loot the mosque.  Shrine of Imam Awn-Al Din  The shrine of Imam Awn-Al Din was built by Badr Al-Din Lulu in the Atabeg Period, 646. The shrine was built in a cemetery, surrounded by graves. The structure survived the 13th Century Mongol Invasion. However in 25 July 2014, the shrine was damaged with explosives planted by ISIL. Before the destruction, bulldozers were also used as well.  Mosque and tomb of Qadib Al-Ban Mosuli  The tomb of Sheikh Qadib Al-Ban Al Mosuli was originally his house, the Saint was buried in his house.

In 2014 ISIL destroyed the structure with explosives.  Mosque of Shaykh Al-Shatt  The structure was a complex of a mosque and shrine. The shrine was originally a Takiyya (Sufi lodge) built in the mosque courtyard by Muhammad Efendi al-Afghani, also known as Shaykh Al-Shatt. Muhammad Efendi al-Afghani was buried in the Takiyya, thus the mosque and shrine were also visited. The tomb was destroyed in 2014 by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Meelick (M√≠leac in Irish) is a townland on the River Shannon in Ireland. It lies approximately 4 km southeast of Eyrecourt in County Galway.  Oldest Catholic Church in use  Meelick has the oldest Irish Roman Catholic church, with continuous use since 1414 AD.Diocese of Clonfert, Ireland Founded as a Franciscan abbey, the church and sacristy are still in use today. The ruins include traces of the transept chapel, friary and small mill. Papal permission for Meelick friary was granted by John XXII in 1414. The last friar of Meelick was Fr. Bonaventure Francis Reynolds. When he died in November 1852, there was no friar available to replace him. Since then the church has been maintained for weekly services. The Meelick Triduum still exists in early August when the Franciscans return to their abbey. Castle An Anglo Norman de Burgo (Burke) Castle was erected close to the church, in the fields to the north of the church. The earthworks relating to this castle can still be seen. The location was chosen because Meelick was one of the few traditional crossing points where the river Shannon could be forded.  Recreation  Meelick Lock on the River Shannon Meelick is a location for fishing, primarily salmon and wild brown trout.Meelick Salmon Fishery, Mid Shannon, Banagher - A Fisheries Guide The river here is wide (over 1.5 km from bank to bank at its broadest point) and has a number of islands, weirs, pools and streams. There are islands separating an artificial cut on the County Offaly bank with the main River Shannon at Meelick on the County Galway bank. It has a very small spring salmon run from April into mid-May. Summer salmon arrive generally from mid- June. Runs are moderate and variable from year to year. Meelick is on the route of the Hymany Way, part of the Beara-Breifne long distance walking and cycling trail between the Beara Peninsula in County Cork and Blacklion in County Cavan.http://bbgreenway.com/towns/meelick.html  All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 1887  In 1887 Meelick were one of the first teams to compete for the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, the first national championship of the game of hurling ever held in Ireland. Representing County Galway in the final, Meelick were defeated by Thurles, representing County Tipperary. The game was held in Birr in County Offaly in front of a crowd of 5,000. Patrick Madden, captain of the Meelick side, is commemorated with a plaque on the gable end of his birthplace and lifetime home in the village. Meelick-Eyrecourt is the name of the local Gaelic Athletic Association club today.  Meelick Lock  Meelick lock, also known as Victoria Lock is one of the busiest locks on the Shannon Navigation. It is 43.4m. long by 12m. wide. The rise of water levels is 2.4m. It was built by the Shannon Commissioners in Limestone in the mid 19th. century to address a shallows and change of level in the river. The Engineer in Charge was Thomas Rhodes. The stone used for the Lock was excavated from the new canal bed. The canal serving the new lock was built in 1841 by William MacKenzie Contractor. When the Lock works were being undertaken the workmen went on strike- looking for more pay. They wanted 1s. 3d. per day. The lock was completed in 1843. Originally the gates were made of French oak and planked in northern pine. The lock replaces the earlier Hamilton Lock on the Clonahenoge Canal.http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=OF&regno;=14929013 Defences The river crossing at this location has a long history and is therefore guarded by defences, including the de Burgo castle mentioned above. Meelick Martello Tower was constructed along with other Martello towers by the government about 1811 on Moran Island at Clonahenoge on the County Offaly side of the River Shannon was built to protect Leinster from a Napoleonic invasion and to control the river crossing at Keelogue.

Annalistic references From The Annals of the Four Masters: * M1557.7. A hosting was made by the Lord Justice to banish the O'Conors of Offaly from Meelick, after having heard that they were there; and he conveyed and carried great guns to Athlone, and from thence sent them in boats to Meelick, while he himself marched his army through Bealach-an-fhothair, and by Lurgan-Lusmhaighe. He afterwards took Meelick and Breac-chluain, and slew Donough, the son of Colla, together with others of the warders. The entire territory was plundered and ravaged on that occasion. The sons of Melaghlin Balbh were banished from the territory, together with the insurgents. The Lord Justice left an English constable at Meelick, i.e. Master Francis, and took hostages from the two O'Maddens, namely, from Melaghlin Modhardha and Breasal, and other hostages from Mac Coghlan, namely, his son and others: and thus was Siol-Anmchadha taken, and it is not easy to state or enumerate all that was destroyed on that expedition.

Set on a desert island with a group of beachcombers as the main characters, the strip addressed serious issues of its time.  Publication history  James Childress (April 13, 1941 ‚Äì January 22, 1977) created Conchy in the early 1960s as an homage to his love of beachcombing. By 1962, Childress was pitching the strip to syndicates with no results. Eventually, he started marketing it directly to newspapers under the business name Corinthian Features. Through this, Conchy began its newspaper run on March 2, 1970. By 1974, Conchy was appearing in 26 papers, finally attracting a syndicate's interest, from Field Newspaper Syndicate, who signed Childress up that year. His client list increased to over 150 papers. During this time, Tempo Books published three collections of Conchy dailies: Conchy, Man of the Now; Conchy on the Half-Shell (abridged from the first book, with new material added); and Conchy, Living in Tomorrow's Past. Brant Parker, creator of The Wizard of Id, provided a foreword to Childress's first book, calling him a born cartoonist: \\"This book is just another step on his way to the top.\\" Field Enterprises wanted Childress to content himself with simpler gags rather than his frequent serious musings. When Childress refused, Field Enterprises severed its partnership with him in 1976, and Childress returned to self-syndication. Despite an initial dip immediately after this, Conchy's newspaper circulation soon reached an all-time high, achieving modest commercial success. Facing family and financial difficulties in addition to a custody battle with his ex-wife, Childress committed suicide in 1977. The daily run ended on February 5, 1977, and the last Sunday strip was published March 13, 1977. (Sunday) Story and characters Conchy consisted of both typical gag strips and strips about serious subjects like nuclear proliferation, political corruption and death. These ruminations were usually courtesy of either Conchy or Oom Paul, as both characters were highly individual thinkers. * Conchy ‚Äî Pronounced \\"con-chee\\" (referring to conches) - an Everyman beachcomber * Oom Paul ‚Äî A pipe-smoking, somewhat cynical individual who self-assuredly assumes the position as mentor to the small island clan * Bug ‚Äî A rugged-looking but gentle individual who enjoys life to the fullest simply because he never gives much serious thought to anything * Patch and Duff ‚Äî A pair of twin troublemakers who live in a cave * Sea urchin ‚Äî Philosopher of the tide pools, thoughtful but quiet * The islanders ‚Äî The original residents of Conchy's island, the islanders co-exist peacefully with the beachcombers, but they are constantly plagued with a never-ending hot- and cold-running war with the inhabitants of the neighboring East Island * The king ‚Äî The ruler of Conchy's island and cousin to the king in The Wizard of Id  Analysis  Mark Evanier and Sergio Aragon√©s are among comics professionals who feel Conchy deserves wider attention today. Evanier wrote in his blog on December 29, 2005, \\"I'd like to see someone do a big book that collected the entirety of Conchy, a short-lived but wonderful newspaper strip.\\" The next day he noted that Aragon√©s concurred.Evanier, Mark.

It is affiliated with FORTA since its inception, and it is a public channel that belongs exclusively to the autonomous government of Madrid. It began its broadcast on 2 May 1989 in Madrid. Since then, the programming has been dominated by educational programs directed towards the population of that region. Since Madrid is the capital of the country, it puts special emphasis on national political information. As with many other autonomous Spanish networks, Telemadrid suffered greatly during the Spanish financial crisis and requested ‚Ç¨88m from the Spanish government to prevent it from becoming bankrupt.  First years  Telemadrid was created by the PSOE government (Spanish Socialist Party) when Joquin Leguina was the president of the Madrid Autonomous Region. During its first years, Telemadrid occupied the buildings of the Agencia EFE, where it suffered an attack from GRAPO at lunchtime on 29 May 1993, yet suffered no victims. In fact, the event was covered live on Telemadrid. On 11 March 1997 they celebrated the opening of their current location, in the Ciudad de la Imagen, in Pozuelo de Alarc√≥n, Madrid. The building, which was called \\"special interest\\" on World Architecture Day in October 1997, holds all of the production centers for the radio-television entity. The programming of Telemadrid has always revolved around the lives of madrile√±os, focusing on information, sports, children's programming, series and movies and politics. Some of their shows have been exported to other autonomous regional television stations, and even to other national television stations like \\"Buenos d√≠as, Madrid\\" or \\"Madrid Directo\\". During its lifetime, it has featured such shows as La banda de Telemadrid, Cyberclub, Top Madrid, Todo Madrid, Gran V√≠a, F√∫tbol es f√∫tbol, and En acci√≥n. Currently, the lineup of the station is made up of more than eight hours of information in many different formats: Telenoticias, C√≠rculo a primera hora, Alto y claro, Diario de la noche, Sucedi√≥ en Madrid, En pleno Madrid, Mi c√°mara y yo and Telenoticias sin fronteras. In addition, the station, has always broadcast sports (En acci√≥n, Madrid se mueve, F√∫tbol es f√∫tbol and the national league - until 2006) and it has broadcast bullfighting programs and information.  The digital era  The year 2001 marked a turning point in the history of the Ente P√∫blico Empresarial. Telemadrid became the first autonomous television station to utilize Digital terrestrial television (DTT). After a year in tests, on 19 March 2001, the President of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz-Gallard√≥n, inaugurated the broadcast of laOtra, a second autonomous channel exclusively for the DTT system. During its first years it focused on programs of cultural content, suggesting a new model of television with new formats, focused on music, literature, art, and modern sociopolitical movements. The principal programs were B√°sico, Central de sonidos, Trasluc√∫a, De formas, Otras entrevista, Otra gente, Uno m√°s and La vieja ceremonia, among others. Nevertheless, this second channel suffered a restructuring in 2006, when it began broadcasting in analog format. Since then, the old content of laOtra began to share airtime with reruns of the primary channel and with newscasts, sports, and children's shows. The analog broadcasting set the national and autonomous administrations at odds on several occasions, since laOtra began its analog broadcast without the permission of Spain's Ministry of Industry, who oversees the allocation of broadcast frequencies, and to whom the station had gone on previous occasions to obtain a license. The broadcast emissions were found to have originated from the facilities of a water company, Canal de Isabel Segunda, politically linked to the Community of Madrid. As of September 2006, Telemadrid' faces a fine of one million euros and the cancellation of laOtra if in fact it is considered just under Spanish law. Many believe that this sanction hurts the Madrile√±os when compared with the citizens of other autonomous communities who already have two channels broadcast in analog format, like Euskadi, Andalusia, Valencia, or the Canary Islands, and even three, as in the case of Catalonia. Others by contrast believe that Telemadrid did not follow appropriate procedure and that consequently it should accept the closure of the channel. Criticism and controversy Telemadrid is the public broadcaster of the Autonomous Community of Madrid, meaning it is funded by the regional government of Madrid. Since the arrival of Esperanza Aguirre as the President of Madrid on 17 October 2003, many people have accused Aguirre of transforming Telemadrid into the mouthpiece of her party, the ruling party of Madrid, the Partido Popular (PP). When Aguirre came to power, she hired Manuel Soriano to become the general director of Telemadrid. Soriano is a member of the PP and worked as press secretary of Aguirre when she was the Minister of Education and Culture during government of Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar. The biggest controversy caused by Telemadrid was a documentary about 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings. In that documentary, it aired the conspiracy theory popular with the Spanish right-wing as a fact, that the Basque separatist group, ETA, was involved in the bombings. It claimed that ETA helped Al Qaeda with the bombings, even though the investigations of the attack have debunked the claims about ETA's involvement. The documentary was also sympathetic of former Prime Minister Aznar and the Partido Popular and their reaction of the attack, and it accused the PSOE of using the attack to win the 2004 Elections. Telemadrid caused another big controversy in April 2007, when it aired a documentary called \\"Ciudadanos de segunda\\" (Second-class Citizens), which claimed that the Spanish language and the people who speak it were being persecuted in Catalonia in favor of the Catalan Language. This documentary caused outrage in Catalonia's political spheres. Josep Piqu√©, the leader of the Catalan branch of the Pardido Popular, said that the documentary didn't represent the reality of Catalonia. Meanwhile, the independentist Catalan party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya demanded that the Generalitat de Catalunya respond to Telemadrid judicially, to no avail. local non-nationalist political parties such as Ciutadans de Catalunya, however, stated that the documentary reflected was largely accurate. Another controversy took place in June 2011, when in an aired report about the 15M movement were included images of riots between the protesters and the police that actually belonged to demonstrations in Greece, being clearly visible Greek flags and policemen.

Historical churches and monasteries  = Church of Shamoun Al-Safa = The oldest church in Mosul, Shamoun Al-Safa (St. Peter), dates from the 9th century and is very difficult to find. It has a deep underground courtyard and a cemetery between high walls containing some ornate tombstones of Maslawi merchants. Previously, it bore the name of the two Apostles, Peter and Paul. It is considered a very important church due to its archeological value. It lies 5 m below street level. The church includes an epitaph of Shammas Raphael Mazagi who established a Chaldean printing press and a Patriarchal seminary next to the church. After the latter has been transferred to Baghdad in 1960, the building was inhabited by the nuns of the Sacred Heart. = Church of Mar Toma = The exact time of its foundation is unknown, but it can be assumed that the Syriac Orthodox Church of Saint Thomas dates prior to 770, since reference tell that Al-Mahdi, the Abbasid Caliph, listened to a grievance concerning this church on his trip to Mosul. Inside, dozens of bulbs produce a blaze of electric light. The altar-cross as well as the altar-steps are brightly lit. There is an old Bible in Syriac on a lectern and a lime-green one with dark blue borders. And, on one wall, a small illuminated and glass- fronted pigeon-hole in which are the relics of St. Thomas as well. = Mar Petion Church = The Mar Petion Church is named after a martyr of the same name who was educated by his cousin in a monastery and died in 446. It is the first Chaldean Catholic church in Mosul, after the union of the Church of the East with Rome in the 16th century. It dates back prior to the 10th century and lies 3m below street level. This church suffered destruction and it has been reconstructed many times. A hall has been built on one of its three parts in 1942. As a result, most of its artistic features have been lost. = Ancient Tahira Church = Near Bash Tapia is the Ancient Tahira Church (The Immaculate) which is considered one of the most ancient churches in Mosul. No evidence helps to determine its exact location. It could be either the remnants of the church of the Upper Monastery or the ruined Mar Zena Church. Al-Tahira Church dates back to the 7th century, and it lies 3m below street level. A last reconstruction took place in 1743. = Mar Ahudeni Church = Mar Ahudeni Church was named after Mar Ahudemmeh (Hudeni) Maphrian of Tikrit who martyred in 575. Mar Hudeni is an old church of the Tikritans in Mosul, dating back to the 10th century. It lies 7 m below street level. First reconstructed in 1970, people can now get mineral water from the well in its yard. The chain, fixed in the wall, is thought to cure epileptics. = St. George's Monastery = Located in the north of Mosul, St. George's Monastery (Mar Gurguis) was named after St. George. Most probably it was built late in the 17th century. Pilgrims from different parts of the north visit it annually in spring, when many people travel to its surrounding areas on holiday. It is about 6 m below street level. When a modern church was built over the old one in 1931, much of its archeological significance was lost. The only monuments left are a marble door-frame decorated with a carved Estrangelo (Syriac) inscription and two niches which date back to the 13th or 14th century. The church was completely destroyed on 2014 by ISIS militants. = Mar Matti Monastery = Mar Matti Monastery is a famous monastery situated about 20 km east of Mosul on the top of Mount Alfaf (Mount Maqloub). It was built by Mar Matte, a monk who fled with several other monks in 362 from the Monastery of Zuknin near the city of Amid (Diyar Bakir) in the southern part of Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) and the north of Iraq during the reign of Emperor Julian the Apostate (361-363). It has a library containing Syriac scriptures. = Monastery of Mar Behnam = The Monastery of Mar Behnam is also called Deir Al-Jubb (The Cistern Monastery). Situated in the Nineveh Plain near Nimrud about 32 km southwest of Mosul, it was built in the 4th century and expanded in the 12th or 13th century. The monastery is a great fort-like building rising next to the tomb of Mar Behnam. This was a prince who was killed by the Sassanians, perhaps during the 4th century. A legend made him a son of an Assyrian king.

Alfred Charles Whiteway (born 1931) was found guilty and hanged for the murders, which attracted a deal of press attention, the case being described at the time as \\"one of Scotland Yard's most notable triumphs in a century\\". At the trial, defence counsel Peter Rawlinson had subjected lead detective Herbert Hannam to what was at the time considered a very sharp cross- examination on Whiteway's contention that the main evidence against him had been manufactured by police. Victims The victims were 16-year-old Barbara Songhurst and 18-year-old Christine Reed. The girls had been on a bicycle trip on Sunday, 31 May 1953, and were seen cycling along the towpath beside the River Thames at about 11pm. They failed to return home. Songhurst's body was found the next day floating in the river, and Reed's body was found on 6 June, after a section of the river was drained. Pathologist Keith Mant determined that both victims had been beaten, raped and killed with a hatchet. Investigation Alfred Charles Whiteway, 22 years old, separated from his wife and living with his parents in Sydney Road, Teddington, was arrested a month later after the two separate rapes of women in Surrey. At first, he denied any involvement. Later, a PC found an axe under the back seat of a police car in which Whiteway had apparently hidden it following his arrest for the rape of a 14-year-old girl and an attack on a woman in the Oxshott Heath and Woods. The axe was found at the house of the police constable, who had taken it home and was using it to chop wood. Forensic tests of the time could only inconclusively link traces of blood on the axe and Whiteway's shoes to the murders, but his signature to what police said was a confession taken down by them was crucial evidence for the prosecution. Whiteway however, always insisted he had been told to sign at the bottom of a blank sheet of paper and police had simply manufactured the confession.The Canberra Times, 17 September 1953The Canberra Times, 30 October 1953magazine, 22 April 1957 at Google BooksNational Archives Freedom of Information Requests, June 2006; http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/foi-june2006.pdf\\"The Towpath Murders\\", \\"Murder Maps\\" Series 3 Episode 3, broadcast 26 October 2017, presented by Nicholas Day on Yesterday (TV channel) Trial Whiteway was tried at the Old Bailey in October and November 1953 before Mr Justice Hilbery. He was defended by solicitor Arthur Prothero, who instructed Peter Rawlinson, then a relatively junior barrister. Rawlinson cross-examined murder squad detective Herbert Hannam at length, opening large holes in his evidence of the confession, which Whiteway claimed was a work of fiction. Press reports complained at the implication that the police were lying. In view of police methods of the time, and Hannam's book expressing the opinion that the law sometimes must be ignored by detectives, subsequent commentary has thought it not unlikely that Whiteway had been \\"verbaled\\". On 2 November, after forty- five minutes of deliberation, the jury found Whiteway guilty. An appeal was heard by the Lord Chief Justice (Lord Goddard), Mr. Justice Sellers and Mr. Justice Barry but was rejected on 7 December. Whiteway was hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 22 December 1953. The axe is in the Black Museum at Scotland Yard.

Early life Bonnell was a star athlete at Milford High School near Cincinnati, Ohio, where he played both varsity baseball and basketball on championship teams. Following high school graduation in 1971, he attended the Ohio State University on a full athletic scholarship where he played both baseball and basketball. He left college during his senior year to play Major League Baseball. He was the first pick in the 1975 MLB January Draft ‚Äì Secondary Phase (for college players who had been previously drafted out of high school) by the Philadelphia Phillies. MLB career During his 10-year major league career, Bonnell played for the Atlanta Braves of the National League, and for the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners of the American League. His major league debut with the Braves was in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 4, . His best year was , when he hit .318 (10 HR, 54 RBI and 10 SB) for the Blue Jays. Known by his peers as a \\"money hitter\\", Bonnell hit four grand slams during his career and led his teams in game-winning hits nearly every year he played. Bonnell was known for his strong and accurate throwing arm. Traded to the Seattle Mariners in , he contracted Valley fever during spring training, and developed pneumonia. Bonnell struggled to play with the affliction. It took a year to recover and he served his remaining two years as a bit player. Personal life Bonnell married his high school sweetheart, Stefnie Stapp. Bonnell is a devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and he introduced Braves teammate Dale Murphy to the faith. Bonnell pursued a career in aviation after exiting MLB during the All-Star Break in 1986. He attended Flight Safety International's Airline Transition Program and was hired as a first officer by Northwest Airlink's Express Air One. Bonnell flew the twin engine turboprop SAAB 340-B for a year but decided that with the events of the day, notably, the failure of Eastern Airlines and, for the second time, the failure of Braniff Airlines, that there were too many high time furloughed pilots flooding the system for him to have a reasonable opportunity to advance to a job flying jets for a major airline. Bonnell left flying to enter the business world, where he worked in the home medical equipment field for ten years. After that he became an importer, supplying a variety of items to large brick and mortar retail chains. Bonnell then became a writer. He has completed work on his personal memoirs and has published the first book in a series planned for at least three works.

Launch site Sheboygan (Geographical coordinates: 43¬∞45'3.6\\"N, 87¬∞42'50.4\\"W) was first used as a site for launching suborbital rockets in 1995. More than 300 students from Wisconsin and neighboring states developed and ran experiments using eight foot rockets as part of a local Rockets for Schools program. 20 foot rocket were also launched with assistance from specialists. The maximum altitude of these rockets are usually in the range of 4900 feet (1500 meters). However some of these rockets, equipped with engines of M and N type reached altitudes of 9800 feet (3000 meters). Sheboygan's location west of a restricted airspace over a large lake is ideal for launching rockets and spaceships. An area of Lake Michigan has been restricted since the 1940s, when the United States military had an anti-aircraft training range at Camp Haven. The camp has been closed since 1959, and the site has been redeveloped as Whistling Straits golf course. On a number of occasions Super Loki sounding rockets were launched from Sheboygan by the Florida Space Institute, which reached maximum altitudes of 50 miles (80 kilometers). Proposed spaceport State Senator Joe Leibham and State Assembly representative Steve Kestell introduced legislation in the state legislature to create a Wisconsin Aerospace Authority in 2005. The proposed site has been endorsed by NASA astronauts like Jim Lovell. The bill was signed by Wisconsin governor James Doyle in April 2006. The authority was created to allow the proposed spaceport to use NASA funds. The proposal does not include using any public funds. The spaceport is the only one in the Midwestern United States. The building is currently used to show movies and host flea markets. Great Lakes Aerospace Science & Education Center Museum entrance Education building side The spaceport building was initially housed at the Sheboygan Armory, but the building was closed to the public, except for private events and non-space related films. It was developing an exhibit hall with interactive stations, an education experience, and a planetarium theater.

In the editions of the latter the tractate Derekh Eretz consists of three divisions: # Derek Eretz Rabbah (\\"Large Derekh Eretz\\") # Derek Eretz Zuta (\\"Small Derekh Eretz\\") # Perek ha- Shalom (\\"Section on Peace\\") This division is correct in that there are really three different works, but the designations \\"Rabbah\\" and \\"Zuta\\" are misleading, since the divisions so designated are not longer and shorter divisions of one work, but are, in spite of their relationship, independent of each other. The ancient authorities, who have different names for this treatise, know nothing of the division into \\"Rabbah\\" and \\"Zuta\\"; the Halakot Gedoloted. A. Hildesheimer, p. 647 even includes a large part of the Derek Eretz Zuta under the title \\"Rabbah.\\"  Summary of contents  According to the usual division, DER consists of 11 sections (\\"perakim\\"). The first section contains halakha regarding forbidden marriages (\\"arayot\\"), to which are appended some ethical maxims on marriage. The second section consists of two entirely different parts, the first of which contains reflections on 24 classes of people‚Äî12 bad and 12 good‚Äîwith an appropriate Bible verse for each class; the second enumerates the sins that bring about eclipses of the sun and moon, as well as other misfortunes, the whole ending with some mystic remarks concerning God and the 390 heavens. Section 3, called \\"Ben Azzai\\" by the ancients, contains some moral reflections on the origin and destiny of man. Sections 4 and 5, each beginning with the word \\"Le'olam\\" (Forever), contain rules of conduct for sages and their disciples, the respective rules being illustrated by Biblical events and occurrences of the time of the Tannaim. Sections 6 and 7 (which seem to have been originally one section) illustrate, by means of several stories, the correctness of the rule of conduct, never, in society or at table, to act differently from others that are present. Sections 8 and 9 also discuss rules of conduct during eating and drinking, especially in society; and sections 6 and 8 begin with the same word \\"Ha-nichnas.\\" Section 10, on correct behavior in the bath, also begins with the same word, showing that all these sections, although they differ in content, were composed after one pattern. Section 11 begins with the enumeration of different things that are dangerous to life, and continues with the enumeration of actions and customs that are very dangerous to the soul.  Composition and component parts  This short summary of the contents shows that the work is of very diverse origin and that each section has its own history. It is clear that Section 1 cannot, in view of its halakhic content, belong with the rest of the treatise, which deals exclusively with morals and customs. Elijah of Vilna was therefore undoubtedly right in assigning this section to the treatise Kallah, which precedes DER, and deals entirely with marriage and the rules connected with it. The whole section is merely a later compilation, although some of its passages cannot be traced back to the Talmudim and the Midrashim, as, for instance, the interesting parody on the hermeneutic rule of \\"kal ve-chomer\\". Entirely different in origin is the first part of Section 2, drawn undoubtedly from an old tannaitic source. Four teachings of this section are cited in the Talmud as being taken from a Baraita,Bava Batra 90b; Sanhedrin 76b; Shabbat 88b and one in the name of Rav,Sanh. 76b who often quoted old teachings and maxims.Eruvin 54a The composition shows that this section is not taken from the Talmud, for the division into 12 good and 12 bad classes of men is not found in the Talmud. The other half of Section 2, however, is probably a later interpolation, belonging properly to Section 3. For this section begins with a saying of Ben Azzai concerning four things the contemplation of which would keep men from sin: hence the four classes of four things each that are enumerated in Section 2. Ben Azzai mentioned four things in connection with the four sayings. They are drawn from the Talmud.Suk. 29 Section 3 seems to have been in ancient times the beginning of DER,Rashi on Berachot 22a; Pes. 86b; Tosefta Eruvin 53b for which reason the old writers called the whole treatise \\"Perek ben Azzai.\\" Yet it is difficult to understand how this section came to be taken as the introduction to the treatise, which otherwise (beginning with Section 4) forms a connected whole, and has totally different contents from the Pere·∏≥ ben Azzai. Therefore, as regards date and composition, only sections 4-11 need be considered, since sections 1-3 were not originally integral parts of the treatise. Sections 4-11 are not only similar in content (in that both set forth rules of behavior for different walks of life, and illustrate their meaning by examples from history,) but their whole arrangement and composition also show the hand of the same author. Although the name of this author is not known, his date can be fixed approximately. Among the 16 authorities quoted in the part which has been designated above as the treatise DER proper, none lived later than Judah haNasi, the redactor of the Mishnah. The Yerushalmi quotes a teaching, found in the DER, with the formula \\"Tene be-Derekh ha- Eretz\\";Shab. 6 p. 8a, bottom from this it appears that in the time of the Amoraim a tannaitic collection of the name \\"Derekh Eretz\\" was known, and there is no reason to consider this worth to be different from our DER. Nor is there any cogent reason for not considering this treatise as the source of the many quotations from Baraitas in Talmud Bavli which also appear in DER,Compare Isaiah Berlin's glosses to the treatise although it must be admitted that a great many of the quotations existed in different collections of Baraitas, and that the Talmud drew sometimes from one source and sometimes from another. Therefore, a contemporary of Rebbi (about 160-220)‚Äînot Rebbi himself‚Äîmay have been the author of DER, the first three sections being added much later. A collection known as Hilkhot Derekh Eretz existed even in the school of Rabbi Akiva;Berachot 22a but, as the term \\"Hilkhot\\" indicates, it was composed entirely of short teachings and rules of behavior and custom, without any references to Jewish Scripture and tradition. It is even highly probable that the treatise was based on the older collection, and that the work of the later editors consisted merely in the addition to the old rules of illustrations from the Bible and from history. For example, in the old collection there was a rule, \\"No one must enter the house of another without due announcement.\\" This teaching was amplified by a later editor, who added: \\"This rule of behavior is taught out of the mouth of God Himself, who stood at the gate of paradise and called to Adam, 'Where are you?'\\"Gen. 3:9 and to this is added the story of a journey of Jewish scholars to Ancient Rome, and how they comported themselves there.Section 5  Stories  It is characteristic of this treatise that in order to emphasize its rules, it relates many stories of the private life of the Tannaim. A most interesting one is the following, which is used as an illustration to the rule, always to be friendly and obliging: Stories of this nature lend a peculiar charm to DER. Other versions of the tractate The version of the treatise found in Machzor Vitrypp. 724 et seq. is different from that in the editions of the Talmud. Instead of the first part of the second section, there is in the former version a collection of teachings and reflections on various subjects, arranged according to numbers. The version of the treatise Kallah in Nahman Coronel's Hamishah KuntresimVienna, 1864 contains most of DER (specifically, the whole of sections 3‚Äì5, and parts of the following sections). Aside from the variants found here, Coronel's version has also a kind of \\"gemara\\" to the text. This gemara, however, is of very late origin, being in all probability a product of the 10th century, although it contains matter of great value and of very ancient (Essene or Hasidean) origin. The Gemara, which is quoted by Isaac Aboab I in Menorat ha-Ma'or, is printed in the Vilna Edition Shas.Romm, 1889 References * Segal, Arthur, A Modern Commentary to Talmud Bavli Tractates Derek Eretz Zuta and Rabbah : The Path and Wisdom for Living at Peace with Others, in four volumes, Rabbi Arthur Segal, (2012, Amazon Press).

This amounts to a total of in 32 countries.Who Owns The World official website. Last updated 27 February 2007 Accessed 1 February 2017 For those unfamiliar with royalty, the Crown is never separate from the individual who holds it but is as one with them. Her Majesty the Queen is the Crown while she is Queen, and she loses neither her personality nor her individuality while she is monarch. In all territories owned by the Crown, including Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the governments of those countries do not own the land of the country, but may and frequently do administer it on behalf of its owner, HM Elizabeth II. More significantly all forms of land possession in those territories are based, formally and in law, on the Crown's superior ownership. This is why the Land Registry in places like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia cannot register land ownership, only tenure. This is also why freehold and leasehold are defined in law as forms of tenure, not ownership. Cahill also noted that of all the countries in the world that he looked at over a several year period, the only major country in which ownership of land was clearly defined as belonging to the citizens who had paid for it was the United States This is sometimes called 'allodial' ownership but is a changed meaning of that word. Originally 'allodial' meant land that could not be bought or sold or have a debt attached to it. Countries which have a form of direct ownership, even if it is not clear in their respective constitutions, include Germany, Switzerland, France, possibly Spain and in the future, Russia. In the United States the Federal Government owns about one third of the land of the country. But it does so as a landowner on a legal par with any other landowner and without a superior right to any land other than that endorsed on deeds as the property of the Federal Government. As a government the Federal Authorities and other public bodies do possess the right, sometimes called 'eminent domain', to acquire privately owned land for public purposes. Business Age Magazine, 2001 In the October 2001 Business Age Magazine (p18), Kevin Cahill wrote about the economy of Cornwall. In \\"The Killing of Cornwall\\", he notes that HM Treasury in London extracted ¬£1.95 billion in taxes out of Cornwall's GDP of ¬£3.6 billion. The Treasury returned less than ¬£1.65 billion, so there was a net loss to Cornwall of 300 million pounds, where the total earnings figure is 24% below the national average. Cornwall was getting poorer by the day, with Cahill offering this explanation: \\"One very simple and easily provable answer is because the Government in London is raping Cornwall fiscally. The fiscal deficit of over ¬£300 million all but completely explains the increasing pace of impoverishment in Cornwall.\\" Cahill concludes his Business Age article with the lament that Cornwall will not recover until the gap between the tax take and the exchequer give is at least neutralised and better still, reversed.Cahill, Kevin (2001) \\"The Killing of Cornwall\\", Business Age Magazine, October 2001, pg. 18.

Sigler, Fishes of Utah (University of Utah Press, 1996), pp. 93-96. The Virgin spinedace habitat is clear water about 1 m (3 ft) deep, preferably close to cover, such as overhanging shrubs or banks, near vegetation, and over sand or gravel. The fish prefers slow water in areas that do not experience heavy flooding. The fish can tolerate water temperatures of 29 ¬∞C (85 ¬∞F) or higher, a useful ability in the summer when the river becomes intermittent and the fish must crowd into isolated pools. They prefer clear, cool, relatively swift streams with scattered pools, and often will use shear zones between low and high current velocities.http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/edits/documents/Lepimomo.fo_000.pdf Range Populations are known at various locations in the Virgin River system, including the North Fork and East Fork of the Virgin River in Zion National Park, the Santa Clara River, Beaver Dam Creek, and Ash Creek. Although the species has a very restricted range, most of the critical habitat has been protected under a conservation agreement, and it is not listed as endangered.1996 FWS press release on conservation agreement The Virgin spinedance is also found in Mohave County, Arizona, in the lower Beaver Dam Wash to its confluence with the Virgin River at Littlefield. They are historically present in the Virgin River from the Utah border to Littlefield, primarily in conjunction with clear water inflows of perennial tributaries.  Population trends The Virgin spinedace has completely disappeared from 37% of postulated historic habitat in the Virgin River. Decreases in habitat occupied in major tributaries vary between 31% and 100%. As of 1995, the Virgin spinedace were last officially observed by Bureau of Land Management personnel in 1991, where the remaining fish were caught and deposited at the Arizona State University Museum.Arizona Game and Fish Department Native Fish Diversity Review. 1995. Tempe, Arizona.  Management factors  The major factors affecting Virgin spinedace are water diversion, impoundment, channelization, degradation of water quality, and introduced species, both fishes and crayfish. Two specific problems are competition with Richardsonius hydrophlox and predation by brown trout (S. trutta). Management emphasizes implementation of the Virgin River Spinedace Conservation Agreement, which calls for the protection and enhancement of the Virgin River water quantity and quality as well as seeks to limit the effects of nonnative fish species in Spinedace waters, and also aims to re-establish additional populations in the Virgin Spinedace historical habitat.

It committed 33 murders in four years, and had planned to assassinate Francesco Cossiga, Gianfranco Fini and Adolfo Urso. The group maintained close links with the Banda della Magliana, a Rome-based criminal organization, which provided such logistical support as lodging, false papers, weapons, and bombs to the NAR. In November 1981, it was discovered that the NAR hid weapons in the basements of the Health Ministry. The first trial against them sentenced 53 persons on 2 May 1985 on charges of terrorist activities. Ideology The late seventies were a time of political violence in the form of bombings, assassinations, and street warfare between rival militant factions. Young neo-fascists saw the state-sanctioned far-right political party MSI as betraying them, through inaction in the face of attacks by political opponents and the police such as the Acca Larentia killings. Influenced by leftist movements, a large group of far-right youths, including Fioravanti and his close associates, moved from street-fighting to terrorism. Unlike their left-wing counterparts, they emphasised personal qualities like spontaneity and willingness to fight, even in a lost cause, over political objectives. Fioravanti has said, \\"About defeat we never cared, we are a generation of losers, always on the side of the defeated.\\" Members The NAR were directed by former RAI child actor, Valerio Fioravanti, his brother Cristiano Fioravanti, Dario Pedretti, Francesca Mambro and Alessandro Alibrandi, who were previous militants of the Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI).NAR: ‚Äúspostati‚Äù o figli (il)legittimi del Movimento Sociale Italiano?

According to the Magliana pentito, Maurizio Abbatino, NAR member Massimo Carminati was the only one who could freely access the weapons cache. Massimo Carminati not only held close links with the Banda della Magliana, but also with SISMI secret agents, in particular General Pietro Musumeci and colonel Giuseppe Belmonte, a member of the Propaganda Due Masonic lodge. =Assassinations= On 23 June 1980, NAR members Gilberto Cavallini and Luigi Ciavardini (who was later sentenced to a 30-year prison term in 2007 for his role in the 1980 Bologna bombings) assassinated magistrate Mario Amato. Amato had been made responsible for investigations into the radical right in Italy after the assassination of judge Vittorio Occorsio on 10 July 1976.

Early life  Davies was born in Pwllheli, and attended the local grammar school followed by University College, Aberystwyth. He went on to St John's College, Oxford.  Political career  When David Lloyd George was given a Peerage after 54 years representing Caernarvon Boroughs, Davies was chosen as the Liberal Party candidate to follow him. He faced a contest against Plaid Cymru but won the byelection, taking his seat just as the Second World War was coming to an end in Europe. Unfortunately for Davies, the end of the war brought a swift dissolution to Parliament and he lost his seat to the Conservative Party in the 1945 general election. He had one of the shortest tenures as a Member of Parliament during the Twentieth Century.  Later life  After his defeat, Davies was appointed to the Chair of Common Law in the Faculty of Law at the University of Liverpool. He was also Warden of Derby Hall. This position allowed him to take several public appointments, including as a member of the Criminal Law Revision Committee where his advice in relation to the law of dishonesty led to a significant reform in the Theft Act 1968. His academic position also helped him to publish significant works on the history of patents, and he was President of the Society of Public Teachers of Law in 1960‚Äì61. In 1962 he was the Cooley Lecturer at the University of Michigan. Within Liverpool University he was Public Orator from 1950 to 1955, and Pro-Vice-Chancellor from 1956 to 1960. The Faculty of Law building at Liverpool was largely built at his instigation. After retirement in 1971, Davies moved to Caernarfon where he indulged his interest in Rugby union (he had been Life President of Liverpool University Rugby Football Club and Vice President of London Welsh RFC, and became President of Pwllheli Sports Club for ten years. He served as a Magistrate in both Liverpool and Caernarfon, and was High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire in 1967‚Äì68. Davies was a great after- dinner speaker, regaling his audience with a large fund of Welsh anecdotes suitable for any audience.

Sailing boats can sail at a maximum of 45 degrees close to the wind and will sail faster on a reach than when at closest to the wind.

It probably dates from classical antiquity, and first appeared in modern times in 1894, shortly after the Ludovisi Throne was found and sold at auction. It was purchased by Edward Perry Warren for the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1896. The Boston Throne is a cuboid block of marble, carved in relief on three sides. The main panel on one long side shows a central naked winged youth, holding scales (mostly now lost). The pans of the scales remain, each containing the small figure of a youth. The central figure stands between two figures of women dressed in Ionian tunics and mantles, seated on palmettes and volute. The composition has been interpreted as a psychostasia (weighing of souls), and the figures have variously been identified as Eros, Persephone and Aphrodite, or Eros, Venus and Juno. The two shorter side panel also show figures: one, an old woman mourning; the other, a boy playing a lyre. The consensus is that the sculpture of the Boston Throne is lower in quality than that of the Ludovisi Throne, with less subtle and less figurative characterisation. The Ludovisi Throne is thought to be a 5th-century BC Greek original, but it seems likely that the Boston Throne has a substantially later date; perhaps it was a 1st-century BC Roman companion-piece to the Ludovisi Throne, created for that piece's assumed display-arrangement in the Gardens of Sallust, or it may even be a forgery.Archeology article on Praeneste Fibula, another highly contested piece sold by Martinetti and Helbig.

He was bred by the Oamaru Stud in Victoria. Rubiton's name was a combination of \\"Ruby\\" and \\"ton\\", a colloquial term for 100 runs in cricket. Racing career Rubiton started off solely as a sprinter winning the 1,400 metre weight for age Futurity Stakes and coming third in the Newmarket Handicap and Oakleigh Plate to sprinters Placid Ark and Special. In his four-year-old season, he won his first four starts, dominating at weight for age in the Manikato, Memsie, Feehan and Underwood Stakes. He was then defeated by Drought and Fair Sir in the Caulfield Stakes after overexerting himself in trackwork. Rubiton atoned for the defeat at his next start by winning the 1987 Cox Plate in track record time of 2.02.9, beating (Our) Poetic Prince, Fair Sir and Vo Rogue. He won a week later in the Mackinnon Stakes at Flemington. Having then gone out for a spell, he never returned due to a tendon injury. He was retired to stud with earnings of A$1,360,330. Stud career An outstanding sire at stud, Rubiton is one of only two stallions (the other is Heroic) to win and sire the winner of Australia's greatest weight-for-age race, the Group 1 MVRC Cox Plate. Rubiton's progeny include 38 stakeswinners for 102 stakeswins. Besides Fields of Omagh, twice winner of the Cox Plate (2003 & 2006), Rubiton is the sire of sprinter Rubitano (Newmarket Handicap), Adam (Stradbroke Handicap), Flavour (Victoria Racing Club Stakes), Patezza (Doncaster Handicap), Dilly Dally (T J Smith Stakes), and Monopolize (Hong Kong International Bowl twice).ASB - Rubiton Retrieved on 2009-6-18 He is also sire of sprinter Lucky Secret, winner of 14 of 23 race starts, including, respectively, the Group 2 MRC Schillaci Stakes, MVRC A.J. Moir Stakes and MVRC Stanley Wootton Stakes. Lucky Secret narrowly lost the Group 1 rated MRC Oakleigh Plate, pipped at the post by Swiss Ace. A $220,000 yearling, winner of over $950,000 in prizemoney, Lucky Secret is trained at Caulfield by Tony Vasil. Melbourne Racing Club have long honoured Rubiton with his own race, the Group 3 Rubiton Stakes, run in February.

He registered at university twice, once at University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg (1975) and once at Rhodes University, Grahamstown (1976), but did not graduate either time. Career Maclennan was launched on a career in journalism by a 1975 position on the East London Daily Dispatch which was then under the editorship of Donald Woods. In late 1976 he secured a photojournalist position on the Rhodesia Herald, based in Salisbury (later Harare), Rhodesia until the 1979 downfall of the Ian Smith government. At that time, he returned to Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa with his then wife, Kate Skinner, a librarian, artist and minor poet and their son Seamus. In the Eastern Cape, Ben worked as a reporter for the Eastern Province Herald, with headquarters in Port Elizabeth, and an office in Grahamstown.

Buformin was marketed by German pharmaceutical company Gr√ºnenthal as Silubin. Chemistry and animal toxicology Buformin hydrochloride is a fine, white to slightly yellow, crystalline, odorless powder, with a weakly acidic bitter taste. Its melting point is 174 to 177 ¬∞C, it is a strong base, and is freely soluble in water, methanol and ethanol, but insoluble in chloroform and ether. Toxicity: guinea pig LD50 subcutaneous 18 mg/kg; mouse LD50 intraperitoneal 140 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg oral. The log octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) is -1.20E+00; its water solubility is 7.46E+05 mg/l at 25 ¬∞C. Vapor pressure is 1.64E-04 mm Hg at 25 ¬∞C (EST); Henry's law constant is 8.14E-16 atm-m3/mole at 25 ¬∞C (EST). Its Atmospheric -OH rate constant is 1.60E-10 cm3/molecule-sec at 25 ¬∞C.United States National Library of Medicine ChemLDplus advanced database Mechanism of action Buformin delays absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract, increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake into cells, and inhibits synthesis of glucose by the liver. Buformin and the other biguanides are not hypoglycemic, but rather antihyperglycemic agents. They do not produce hypoglycemia; instead, they reduce basal and postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetics. Biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of 50 mg of buformin to volunteers, almost 90% of the applied quantity was recovered in the urine; the rate constant of elimination was found to be 0.38 per hr. Buformin is a strong base (pKa = 11.3) and not absorbed in the stomach. After intravenous injection of about 1 mg/kg buformin-14-C, the initial serum concentration is 0.2-0.4 ¬µg/ml. Serum level and urinary elimination rate are linearly correlated. In man, after oral administration of 50 mg 14-C-buformin, the maximum serum concentration was 0.26-0.41 ¬µg/ml. The buformin was eliminated with an average half-life of 2 h. About 84% of the dose administered was found excreted unchanged in the urine. Buformin is not metabolized in humans. The bioavailability of oral buformin and other biguanides is 40%-60%. Binding to plasma proteins is absent or very low. Dosage The daily dose of buformin is 150‚Äì300 mg by mouth.Gustav Kuschinsky, Heinz L√ºllmann. Textbook of pharmacology. Academic Press p 225, 1973 Buformin has also been available in a sustained release preparation, Silubin Retard, which is still sold in Romania. Side effects and contraindications The side effects encountered are anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, metallic taste, and weight loss. Its use is contraindicated in diabetic coma, ketoacidosis, severe infection, trauma, other conditions where buformin is unlikely to control the hyperglycemia, renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, recent myocardial infarct, dehydration, alcoholism, and conditions likely to predispose to lactic acidosis. Toxicity Two 50mg buformin (Dibetos) tablets in blister pack from Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical (Japan).Buformin was withdrawn from the market in many countries due to an elevated risk of causing lactic acidosis (although not the US, where it was never sold). Buformin is still available and prescribed in Romania (timed release Silubin Retard is sold by Zentiva), Hungary,Hank√≥ BZ, Reszegi CA, Kumli P, Vincze Z.

Forensic Sci Int. 2020 Jun 20;314:110376. doi: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110376 The lactic acidosis occurred only in patients with a buformin plasma level of greater than 0.60 ¬µg/ml and was rare in patients with normal renal function.Wittmann P, Haslbeck M, Bachmann W, Mehnert H. [Lactic acidosis in diabetics on biguanides (author's translation)] Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift 102(1):5-10, 1977 In one report, the toxic oral dose was 329 ¬± 30 mg/day in 24 patients who developed lactic acidosis on buformin. Another group of 24 patients on 258 ¬± 25 mg/day did not develop lactic acidosis on buformin. Anticancer properties Buformin, along with phenformin and metformin, inhibits the growth and development of cancer. The anticancer property of these drugs is due to their ability to disrupt the Warburg effect and revert the cytosolic glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells to normal oxidation of pyruvate by the mitochondria. Metformin reduces liver glucose production in diabetics and disrupts the Warburg effect in cancer by AMPK activation and inhibition of the mTor pathway. Buformin decreased cancer incidence, multiplicity, and burden in chemically induced rat mammary cancer, whereas metformin and phenformin had no statistically significant effect on the carcinogenic process relative to the control group. Buformin also exhibits anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects in endometrial cancer cells, lung cancer cells and cervical cancer cells. Antiviral properties Biguanides were first noted to be active against influenza in the 1940s. Further studies confirmed their antiviral activity in vitro. Buformin, especially, was potently antiviral against vaccinia and influenza. Buformin is a metabolic antiviral that inhibits the mTOR pathway which the influenza virus uses to infect an animal. Because Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus uses this same pathway, buformin might be effective against COVID-19. History Buformin was synthesized as an oral antidiabetic in 1957. Synthesis USV). Buformin is obtained by reaction of butylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine.

Biography Born in Palermo, Dominici became best known for his many villainous roles in horror and fantasy films. He is best remembered for his performance as the monstrous Igor Javuto in Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960) and the evil Eurysteus in the 1958 Steve Reeves epic Hercules. His filmography includes more than 80 titles, including Antonio Margheriti's Castle of Blood (1964), in which he appeared with Black Sunday star Barbara Steele. Dominici dubbed the voice of Austrian actor Walter Ladengast in the Italian release version of Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979). Dominici's daughter, Germana, is an Italian stage actress; at the age of 14 she had a small role as a farm girl in Black Sunday. =Death= Dominici died of cancer on 7 September 1992 and is buried in Rome, Italy.

In Hudson County, it reaches a height of 260 feet. Rail Western portals of Bergen Hill Tunnels, Long Dock Tunnel, Bergen Arches, and Route 1 Extension Western portal of North River Tunnels Defining features of Bergen Hill include the 19th century and early 20th century railroad rights-of-way. Cuts and tunnels created to provide access to the terminals and ferries on the North River (Hudson River) and Upper New York Bay, and eventually under the river. From south to north they are: * The Central Railroad of New Jersey lines traveled on the CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge across Newark Bay and through Bayonne and Greenville to its Communipaw Terminal. Portions are used by the Hudson Bergen Light Rail. * The Jersey City, Newark and Western Railway (later the Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway) freight line on the bridge over Newark Bay and across Pamrapo is now used by CSX Transportation as the National Docks Secondary to Port Jersey and other points. * Newark and New York Railroad Branch of the Central Railroad of New Jersey (1869), now the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail West Side Branch, ran from Downtown Newark to Communipaw Terminal. Freight in Bergen Hill Cut * The Bergen Hill Cut (1838)- opened by New Jersey Rail Road and Transportation Company, eventually to Pennsylvania Railroad to PRR Station at Exchange Place or Harsimus Branch along the Harsimus Stem Embankment to Harsimus Cove. Now used by PATH Journal Square and Newark lines. * The Erie Cut (1910), whose portals are known as the Bergen Arches-Erie Railroad to Pavonia Terminal, now unused. * The Long Dock Tunnel (1860)- the first Erie Cut, now Conrail Shared Assets (CRCX) freight line * The Bergen Tunnels (1876) & (1908) under Jersey City Heights, built by Morris and Essex Railroad and the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad, Later, the Erie Lackawanna, and now, New Jersey Transit rail lines to Hoboken Terminal. * 9th Street-Congress Street (HBLR station) provides elevator service between the platform in Hoboken and Paterson Plank Road in Jersey City Heights. * The never-built Access to the Region's Core project included a tunnel that would have connected Secaucus Junction with an expanded Pennsylvania Station. * The Gateway Program, a Northeast Corridor infrastructure expansion project includes a tunnel from its portal in North Bergen to Weehawken Cove, under the Hudson River to New York Penn. * The North River Tunnels (1910), part of the Northeast Corridor their western entrance called the Bergen Portal * Liberty Place in Weehawken, was a cut and tunnel for the rail line connecting the waterfront elevator to the entrance of 19th century Eldorado Park, later used by the North Hudson Railway streetcar lines. * Weehawken Tunnel, (1861) West Shore Railroad, now part of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail * Edgewater Tunnel (1894) New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway cut and tunnel; the western portal Is in Fairview and the east end in Edgewater Streetcars The North Hudson County Railway or its predecessor was responsible for many of the innovative engineering works which made streetcar travel on the east face of Bergen Hill possible, including funicular wagon lifts, an inclined elevated, a luxurious elevator, horseshoe curves, and viaducts. Vehicular cuts Other major excavations and structures for vehicular traffic have significantly altered Bergen Hill. Kennedy Boulevard at Journal Square and Journal Square Transportation Center both span the large ravine created there. The divided highway connecting the Pulaski Skyway to the Holland Tunnel runs parallel to the Long Dock Tunnel. The Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix connects the Lincoln Tunnel, which itself enters the Palisades before submerging under the Hudson River. Paterson Plank Road, the Wing Viaduct, Hackensack Plank Road, Pershing Road, Gorge Road are located on the face of the cliffs. Shippen Street in Weehawken is small street that makes a double hairpin turn. Jersey City section Bergen Hill, Jersey City has sometimes been called colloquially \\"The Hill\\", and gives name to The Bergen Hill Historic District Other prominent landmarks on the east side of the hill are the former Jersey City Medical Center (which since 2005 is being renovated and restored as an emerging neighborhood known as Beacon) and the Jersey City High School. Summit Avenue, which starts at The Junction in the Bergen- Lafayette Section follows the route of a path used by Native Americans from their settlement at Communipaw, and was used by New Netherlanders from that village on the bay to the one on the ridge at Bergen. It intersected Newark Plank Road, an early colonial \\"turnpike\\" which ran from Paulus Hook over the hill, at Five Corners, and continued north through Bergen Woods, where it connected with Paterson Plank Road and Hackensack Plank Road.

The Buncombe County Schools system is the largest in Western North Carolina with almost 25,000 students enrolled in 47 schools and programs. It is also one of only 8 school districts in North Carolina to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2017, BCS ranked 16th in the United States and first in the state of North Carolina for the number of National Board Certified Teachers.  Structure  There are seven members of the Board of Education who are elected to serve four-year terms and new members are elected every two years. One candidate is elected from each of the six districts and one at-large. Candidates are elected on a nonpartisan basis. Voters in each district vote for candidates from all districts and for the at- large candidate. The Superintendent is appointed by the Board and serves as Secretary to the Board. For 2017-18, Ms. Ann B. Franklin of the North Buncombe District serves as Madam Chair of the Board of Education. Dr. Tony Baldwin has served the Board of Education as the school superintendent since 2009. A separate entity from the Board of Education is the Buncombe County Schools Foundation. The foundation, which was founded in 1984, supports the schools and employees with volunteers and financial contributions. This school system is divided into six districts: Enka, Erwin, North Buncombe, Owen, Reynolds, and Roberson. Within each school district, there is one high school, one or two middle schools, and three to five elementary schools. Some districts also host an intermediate school, serving grades 5-6; in these districts, the middle school serves grades 7 and 8. The system offers several alternative education settings. At the high school level, an Early College and a Middle College are housed on the campus of Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College (A-B Tech). Early College allows students to earn a high school diploma and associate degree simultaneously, while Middle College confers a high school diploma. Meanwhile, Community High School in Swannanoa, NC provides an alternative education setting for at-risk students. Finally, the Progressive Education Program serves students with intellectual disabilities in age-appropriate settings at three sites: Estes Elementary, Valley Springs Middle School, and T.C. Roberson High School. Buncombe County Schools is also home to the Martin L. Nesbitt Jr. Discovery Academy, a science, technology, engineering, and math focused magnet high school that pulls students from all six Buncombe County Schools Districts. Martin L. Nesbitt Jr. Discovery Academy was the first high school of its kind in the region and is located at the Buncombe County Schools Central Office Building. =Board of Education= *Ann B.

Bird control is the generic name for methods to eliminate or deter pest birds from landing, roosting and nesting. Bird control is important because pest birds can create health-related problems through their feces, including histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and psittacosis. Bird droppings may also cause damage to property and equipment. Birds also frequently steal from crops and fruit orchards. Methods Methods of bird control include physical deterrents, visual deterrents, multi-sensory deterrents, sonic devices, trained birds of prey (falconry),Falconry Bird Deterrents, Eco Environmental Services. chemicals, contraceptives and active barriers, among others. Birds usually adapt quickly to most static bird control devices because the birds adapt after exposure to false threats. The avian control devices that are most effective either physically \\"block\\" the birds or \\"actively modify behavior\\" using a mild harmless shock. Physical bird deterrents include such products as steel or plastic spike systems, bird netting, electrified wire systems, non-electrified wire systems, electrified track systems, slope barriers, mechanical spiders, chemical foggers and more. Sharp bird spikes can pierce and impale birds, while \\"blocking\\" and \\"shocking\\" methods do not harm birds. Unfortunately, blunt tip bird spikes may still impale birds on windy days. The safer shocking and blocking methods simply repel birds from an area with no harm. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) recommends the use of bird netting, bird wire, contraceptives and low- current electric barriers. Many different bird control products are used widely throughout the U.S. and the world with low current shocking wire and strips, netting, and mesh being the most effective bird control methods. Companies recommended by the Human Society that create these kinds of products include Bird Barrier America. Chemical deterrents range from products for turf to avicides. There are taste aversion products for geese, and fogging agents used for birds. Many localities have restrictions on the use of chemicals and pesticides targeted at birds if they intend to kill them. Chemical deterrents that do not harm birds are widely used with limited results. Sonic avian deterrents are used widely in large open areas although effectiveness is low. Sounds are audible, and include predator and distress calls of a variety of birds to discourage pest birds from coming into an area. Common locations for these devices include vineyards, reclamation plants, airports, and other open areas. Sophisticated digital sound reproduction combined with random time off intervals, and random sequences are designed to prevent habituation by birds, and increase long-term effectiveness. Studies have shown most avian species will adapt and ignore such devices within months of initial contact. Other static sound methods with limited effectiveness that birds may adapt quickly to include ultrasonic devices designed for enclosed or semi-enclosed areas. In theory, ultrasonic waves will annoy birds to stop them from entering and remaining in areas such as warehouses, parking garages, and loading docks. These products are not harmful to birds, yet it is debatable if the birds can hear these frequencies at loud enough decibel levels as bird are believed to have similar hearing to humans.Audible Bird Scarers, Eco Environmental Services. Thus, studies have shown effectiveness is very low within months of initial contact when using ultrasonic sound generators to prevent birds from inhabiting an area. If just placed in situ and left, audible bird scarers can easily become ineffective, however when managed on an ongoing basis or used as part of a greater bird deterrent system, sound methods can deliver partial results for low level bird activity. Audible bird scarers are totally ineffective for nesting birds. Wind driven scare devices include tapes, balloons, kites, and lightweight spinning turbines propelled by wind. These devices reflect sunlight and in limited uses scare birds that are new to an area. Typically, birds will quickly become acclimated to such devices as the birds learn the devices are not alive. The latest field testing of sonic colored noise shows the birds habituate after a few months even though the sounds are unnatural. This is because as one bird habituates other birds may learn the noise is meaningless and not a real threat. During nesting season sounds have proven almost totally ineffective to birds foraging for extra food no matter the sounds. Normally, birds adapt within weeks of exposure to bird control devices that are not alive or an actual threat to their survival. Such bird control devices that birds habituate to within weeks include sound devices, mechanical devices, wind blown scare devices, and partial perch modifications. This makes such devices an unwise investment even though they are inexpensive because labor and safety costs are the primary factors in bird control installation. In contrast, birds cannot adapt to total \\"blocking\\" methods or mild electrical low current \\"shocking\\" stimuli that modifies behavior. This is why netting, mesh, and low current electrical barriers are tested to be the most effective avian control devices. High quality materials and long lasting systems have the greatest return on investment because bird problems are perpetual year after year. In 2013, Dr. John Swaddle and Dr. Mark Hinders at the College of William and Mary created a new method of deterring birds and other animals using benign sounds projected by conventional and directional (parametric) speakers. The initial objectives of the technology were to displace problematic birds from airfields to reduce bird strike risks, minimize agricultural losses due to pest bird foraging, displace nuisance birds that cause extensive repair and chronic clean-up costs, and reduce bird mortality from flying into man-made structures. The sounds, referred to as a \\"Sonic Net\\", do not have to be loud and are a combination of wave forms ‚Äì collectively called \\"colored\\" noise ‚Äì forming non-constructive and constructive interference with how birds and other animals such as deer talk to each other. =Pest bird species= Bird control is frequently used for birds considered pests, such as feral pigeons, common starlings, house sparrows, crows and gulls, depending on the area.  Raptors used in bird control(Abatement)  According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

The format was also transmitted in Venezuela by Venevisi√≥n. The show is filmed in Los Angeles and revolves around the twelve Zodiac signs that identify each contestant. The show is hosted by Pen√©lope Menchaca and features advice from co-host Maximiliano Palacio, an Argentine former soccer player turned actor,Maximiliano Palacio To Co-Host Telemundo's '12 Corazones' and Edward'O, an astrologist; Palacio and Edward'O often appear alternately in some episodes and simultaneously in others. In August 2009, Telemundo added English subtitles as closed captions on CC3, airing on Universo in that format. Show format The show consists of 12 contestants divided into two groups (usually four males and eight females, but sometimes vice versa). Each of the contestants is identified and referred to by his/her Zodiac sign. In between segments, Maximiliano Palacio offers love and relationship advice to the contestants. Nature of the show As the show is aimed at women, the host is most exaggeratedly on the female contestants' side. She often mocks the men, baits them to make them look dumb, and praises the ladies when they ridicule them. The true object of this, however, is to find the most suitable man and make him appear, for if any of the male contestants are mature, they will prove so by not resorting to petty insults. They will good-naturedly take all the ridicule and try to win a 'heart' with charm instead. Most episodes commonly feature a themed format, often involving the contestants (and often, host Penelope Menchaca, as well) in costume; themes used on 12 Corazones include beach-themed episodes in which contestants appear in beachwear, and a beauty pageant-style themed episodes, among others. =First segment= After their introduction, the males interact in a mock play, or they are asked to perform a stunt, usually for their ridicule (sing a song, recite a goofy poem, etc.) Then, the host begins a roundtable of discussion on a certain subject. After this is finished, the first group is taken out of the room and the second group decide to eliminate one of their contestants. When the contestants are introduced, the introduction includes their Zodiac sign, nationality or place of birth and their occupation. For example, this woman is a Taurus, Nicaraguan, and is currently in college studying communications. =Second segment= On the second segment, a chosen male or female from the main group is eliminated. Soon afterward, the male or female suitors are introduced (identified by their astrological sign, hometown and occupation; though this portion sometimes is not included), the host then chooses a contestant of each group to interact in a closer way, for example dancing, kissing, etc. To decide what kind of interaction will take place, the host uses some sort of game like a \\"roulette of kisses\\", or two special dice. This is followed by a second roundtable of discussion. Then, each of the male contestants eliminates a female contestant of the other group. This leaves only three contestants in the main group and five contestants on the group of suitors. =Final segment= For the final segment, the host picks a contestant of the second group who is supposed to pick their heart among the male or female contestants. The contestant chosen has the option to accept or reject. The rules of the show allow the contestant of the second group to pick their heart among the contestants from the first group who have already chosen another person from the second group (an example occurred in an episode originally broadcast on January 20, 2011, in which the same male contestant was chosen by each of the five remaining female suitors; the male contestant chose each of the females, effectively rejecting the previously chosen females in the process, also as per the rules of the show). Instances in which a person from the first group chooses the person from the second over the person they have already chosen do occur from time to time, but less commonly in episodes in which the first group consists of four females at the start of the show. Winner When the couples are chosen (usually 1-3 couples) the audience votes for their favorite. The host Pen√©lope Menchaca then calls the winner by the color chair they are sitting in. The winners get a free paid date courtesy of the show. When the winner is chosen they get to kiss again in front of the stage which concludes the program.

It passes through the extreme southeastern corner of the state, running entirely through McCurtain Co.. It has no lettered spur routes. Route description Eastbound on SH-87 just west of the Arkansas state line SH-87 begins at an intersection with US-259 near the unincorporated community of Harris, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from the Red River. SH-87 heads east from here, proceeding along many curves. The highway is two-lane for its entire length, and much of it is very narrow with no shoulders (though a short stretch of highway that was realigned to approach a new girder bridge that replaced an old through truss bridge was built with shoulders). The highway crosses no major rivers, but does bridge Walnut Bayou. SH-87 ends at the Arkansas state line, where it becomes Arkansas Highway 108. SH-87 is shown on the Oklahoma state highway map as concurrent with US-259 to at least Idabel. However, this is an error, as the highway is only signed from US-259 to the Arkansas state line, and is shown on ODOT's internal control section maps as ending at US-259. History State Highway 87 first appeared on the June 1944 state highway map. When it was originally commissioned, the highway was a spur route; its western end was in Idabel, and its eastern end was approximately the location of the present- day US-259‚ÄìSH-87 intersection. Towards the end of its route, SH-87 served Harris. By 1948, SH-87 was extended, setting its eastern terminus at its present location at the Arkansas state line. However, this terminus proved to be temporary at first, as the highway was rerouted to turn north to end at SH-21 (now SH-3) in Tom in 1952. However, by 1957, the state line terminus had been reestablished, and SH-87 has ended there to the present day. In the early 1960s, SH-87's length was at its zenith, as the highway stretched from Idabel to the Arkansas state line. However, on 1963-01-07, US-259 was established. The section of SH-87 from Idabel through Harris was turned over to the new U.S. route, setting the western terminus of the highway to its present-day location.

Rupe Investment Corp. had owned Mapsco, Inc. since 1989.

Impetus for the first Dallas Mapsco began in 1948 when Keith's drivers kept getting lost, and he decided to make a street atlas booklet for them. Keith spent four years appealing to local government entities to obtain current mapping, but was never successful. Finally, in 1951, Keith approached the Dallas City Building Inspection Division, to obtain mapping data. Their maps were the most accurate produced at that time, but had no index. (The building inspectors at that time just knew where everything was by memory.) Keith obtained the BID maps from the city and began to work in the back of the flower shop at 3323 Oak Lawn Avenue, producing an indexed street map. His shop manager, Lily Kendrick, was instrumental in the laborious process of paging and indexing the city of Dallas into a booklet. The first Mapsco Product, the Dallas Street Guide, was printed in 1952, with 3,000 copies produced. The original book covered Dallas and the Park Cities, with insets for Carrollton and Garland, Texas. The book was originally not intended for public sale, and was only to be used by Keith's large fleet of flower delivery drivers. Soon, however, other flower shops began asking Keith and his employees for copies of the books to aid them in their deliveries as well.Harper, Kevin (2001). \\"Mapsco: The First 50 years\\" From 1953 to 1955, the Dallas Mapsco was made with a glued back in order to save costs on production. These first few years also saw the production of Mapsco's first product outside of Dallas, and it was not Fort Worth, but much more distant Houston, where Mapsco again became the first company to make an indexed city street atlas. Unfortunately, the endeavor ended poorly when the glued backs disintegrated in the very humid air of that city, and Mapsco has not produced a Houston map since. For the first few years, Mapscos were not available to the general public, being intended for business and delivery purposes. Sales were slow until 1956, when the city of Dallas bought 300 copies for their fire and ambulance services. In 1955, Mapsco had adopted a Roman military style indexing system. The entire map was divided into numbered pages, and each page overlaid with a lettered grid, allowing any street to be referenced by a page number plus a grid letter. In Dallas, the grid index has not changed since then (although the number of pages has expanded greatly). At that time, the city was a bewildering array of street names that matched streets in yet unannexed areas, which led to a lot of confusion. Mapsco was the only accurate map of the newly sprawling Sunbelt metropolis. By the late 1950s a Mapsco map became a status symbol. 1955 Dallas Mapsco detail In 1956, Dallas Mapscos began to be sold to the general public from the flower shop. For sales, they hired homeless people off the street. A few books were given to the new \\"salesman\\" and if he sold them, he could come back and get some more. If he never came back, they were only out a few books. In 1957, Milton Boyd Keith died and his widow asked his nephew to take over the business. Keith's nephew did not perpetuate the Mapsco but instead took the map bases and formed his own company, called LO-KAT-IT. Keith's widow died soon after, and the Mapsco name all but disappeared. It was about this time that Lily Kendrick, the erstwhile flower shop manager, along with her son Choyce Kendrick, formed a rival company to utilize their mapmaking skills and called it Handymap. The first Handymap was produced in late 1957 and, being more accurate than the rival LO-KAT-IT, undercut its sales. Handymap and the Kendricks were able to acquire the Mapsco naming rights from the Keith family, and the nephew eventually got out of the map business. On December 5, 1957, Lily Kendrick became the President of Handymap, making it one of Dallas' first companies to be headed by a woman. Milton Boyd Keith's adopted son Donald became Vice President, and Lily's son Choyce became the Treasurer. Choyce had ten years in the air conditioning business and was unprepared for the challenges of mapmaking. The Dallas Mapsco, now with the Handymap name on the cover, continued to be produced. With the \\"succession crisis\\" now resolved, Mapscos continued to be made in the back of the flower shop for the remainder of the 50s and 60s. In 1959, the plastic spiral binding was changed to a metal wire binding, which continues in use to this day. Donald Keith sold his stock in the company to Lily in 1959, and the founding Keith family exited the map business. Also in that year, Mapsco acquired its main in-town rival, known as JIFFYMAP. The company paid $5,000 for the maps and name. In 1964, Mapsco expanded the Dallas product and sold it out of the flower shop on Oak Lawn Avenue. In the early 60s, the Dallas Mapsco cost $4.50 each or $3.99 for pre- orders. Additionally, Rand McNally maps and other globe and map products were sold. That year, the company reported a 30% increase in sales over the previous year. Lily retired in 1965 and left the company operations to her son, Choyce, and his wife Frances. In 1970, the company finally outgrew the flower shop and moved to dedicated headquarters at 1644 Irving Blvd in Dallas. The next year, in 1971, Handymap released the first edition of the Fort Worth street guide - the second product in Mapsco's lineup. The early 70s saw Mapsco's sales expand beyond its own store to various retail outlets like gas stations and convenience stores. The energy crisis of 1973 spurred Mapsco sales even further, when oil companies could no longer afford to give out free road maps. Larger sales brought a bigger company, and in 1979 the first profit-sharing plan was enacted. The interior of the Mapsco store in Dallas in the 1970s On March 31, 1981, Handymap changed its name back to Mapsco, officially, and the \\"Handymap\\" name came off the book covers for good. On August 3 of that year Mapsco opened its first retail outlet at Preston Road and Forest Lane in North Dallas. By the early 80s, a Dallas Mapsco cost $10.95 and the book had about 18,000 streets in it. Each year, there were about 750 changes to the Dallas book compared to Fort Worth which had 40% less. In 1984, due to a personal agreement, Choyce Kendrick and Mapsco produced the first Louisville, Kentucky street atlas and it became Mapsco's third book product. Also that year the company topped 100 sales outlets selling Mapsco books - and for the first year sold out of all Dallas and Fort Worth atlases. By the late 80s, Dallas police were reporting that Dallas Mapsco street atlases were the most stolen item from unlocked cars. In 1986, Mapsco needed even more space and moved to a large facility at 5308 Maple Avenue, which also included a new retail store. In 1989, Choyce Kendrick retired from Mapsco and the company left the Kendrick family and was purchased by Dallas-based Rupe Investment Corp. Mapsco's fourth street guide, Austin, Texas, started publication in 1993 and sold for $23.95. The first book was awkward and did not sell well, but by 1999 the Austin Mapsco was selling out. The next atlas, covering Ellis and Johnson Counties, came out the next year. This was the first suburban Dallas book and was made specifically for traffic related to the cancelled Superconducting Super Collider project. In 1993, the Fort Worth Star Telegram noted that \\"the Mapsco name... almost certainly equals that of Coca-Cola and McDonald's to DFW residents... the name has become a generic catch-all for local street directories.\\" In 1994, practically every taxi, fire truck, police car, bus, and courier truck had a Dallas Mapsco inside. In March 1994, Rupe Investment purchased Pierson Graphics in Denver, Colorado. Pierson operated independently for several years, but eventually was merged with Mapsco. Street atlases of Denver, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, and other regional products started to be published by Mapsco. Also in 1994, Mapsco began a multimillion- dollar project to update its mapping to a computerized process. In 1995, Mapsco acquired rights to publish El Paso, Ciudad Ju√°rez and Las Cruces, New Mexico streets guides - thereby expanding into New Mexico and Mexico. In September 1996, Mapsco purchased the Ferguson Map Company in San Antonio, Texas, and began taking over the reins by publishing a San Antonio street atlas. In 1996, the first Mapsco CD-ROM was produced, and in 1997, the Dallas Street Guide was the first to be completely digitally produced. In 1998, the Dallas and Fort Worth Street guides sold for $31.95. Since that time, more new street guides have been produced. These include all of the DFW metroplex and exurban areas, all of Central Texas and the Texas Hill Country, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. In 2000, Mapsco donated its entire archive to the University of Texas at Arlington. In 2001, Mapsco moved the corporate headquarters from the Maple Avenue location to 4181 Centurion Way in Addison, Texas. The Roads of... series In January 2005, Mapsco acquired the rights to The Roads of... series of state atlases. The Roads of Texas was first published in 1988 by Shearer Publishing. As of 2008, titles exist for Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Kentucky. Map & Travel Center locations As of 2015, Mapsco has two locations: one in Addison, Texas, located inside their corporate facility and one in Fort Worth, Texas. Additionally, the Mapsco.com online store is still available. Map & Travel Center closures The Mapsco Map & Travel Center located in Austin, Texas, closed on March 19, 2010. The Mapsco Map & Travel Center located in North Dallas, Texas, closed on March 26, 2010. Mapsco Map & Travel Centers in San Antonio, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, closed at the end of March 2010.

Lipid packing can influence the fluidity of the membrane. Viscosity of the membrane can affect the rotation and diffusion of proteins and other bio-molecules within the membrane, there- by affecting the functions of these things. Membrane fluidity is affected by fatty acids. More specifically, whether the fatty acids are saturated or unsaturated has an effect on membrane fluidity. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain, and the maximum amount of hydrogen. The absence of double bonds decreases fluidity, making the membrane very strong and stacked tightly. Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond, creating a \\"kink\\" in the chain. The double bond increases fluidity. Membrane fluidity is also affected by cholesterol. Cholesterol can make the cell membrane fluid as well as rigid. Factors determining membrane fluidity Membrane fluidity can be affected by a number of factors. One way to increase membrane fluidity is to heat up the membrane. Lipids acquire thermal energy when they are heated up; energetic lipids move around more, arranging and rearranging randomly, making the membrane more fluid. At low temperatures, the lipids are laterally ordered and organized in the membrane, and the lipid chains are mostly in the all-trans configuration and pack well together. The composition of a membrane can also affect its fluidity. The membrane phospholipids incorporate fatty acids of varying length and saturation. Lipids with shorter chains are less stiff and less viscous because they are more susceptible to changes in kinetic energy due to their smaller molecular size and they have less surface area to undergo stabilizing London forces with neighboring hydrophobic chains. Lipid chains with carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturated) are more rigid than lipids that are saturated with hydrogens, as double bonds cannot freely turn. Because of this rigidity, unsaturated double bonds make it harder for the lipids to pack together by putting kinks into the otherwise straightened hydrocarbon chain. While the individual lipids may be more rigid, membranes made with such lipids are more fluid and have lower melting points: less thermal energy is required to achieve the same level of fluidity as membranes made with lipids with saturated hydrocarbon chains. Incorporation of particular lipids, such as sphingomyelin, into synthetic lipid membranes is known to stiffen a membrane. Such membranes can be described as \\"a glass state, i.e., rigid but without crystalline order\\".Heimburg, T. (2007) Thermal Biophysics of Membranes. Wiley-VCH, . Cholesterol acts as a bidirectional regulator of membrane fluidity because at high temperatures, it stabilizes the membrane and raises its melting point, whereas at low temperatures it intercalates between the phospholipids and prevents them from clustering together and stiffening. Some drugs, e.g. Losartan, are also known to alter membrane viscosity. Another way to change membrane fluidity is to change the pressure. In the laboratory, supported lipid bilayers and monolayers can be made artificially. In such cases, one can still speak of membrane fluidity. These membranes are supported by a flat surface, e.g. the bottom of a box. The fluidity of these membranes can be controlled by the lateral pressure applied, e.g. by the side walls of a box. Heterogeneity in membrane physical property Discrete lipid domains with differing composition, and thus membrane fluidity, can coexist in model lipid membranes; this can be observed using fluorescence microscopy. The biological analogue, 'lipid raft', is hypothesized to exist in cell membranes and perform biological functions. Also, a narrow annular lipid shell of membrane lipids in contact with integral membrane proteins have low fluidity compared to bulk lipids in biological membranes, as these lipid molecules stay stuck to surface of the protein macromolecules. Measurement methods Membrane fluidity can be measured with electron spin resonance, fluorescence, atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy, or deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Electron spin resonance measurements involve observing spin probe behaviour in the membrane. Fluorescence experiments involve observing fluorescent probes incorporated into the membrane. Atomic force microscopy experiments can measure fluidity on synthetic or isolated patches of native membranes. Solid state deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy involves observing deuterated lipids. The techniques are complementary in that they operate on different timescales. Membrane fluidity can be described by two different types of motion: rotational and lateral. In electron spin resonance, rotational correlation time of spin probes is used to characterize how much restriction is imposed on the probe by the membrane. In fluorescence, steady-state anisotropy of the probe can be used, in addition to the rotation correlation time of the fluorescent probe. Fluorescent probes show varying degree of preference for being in an environment of restricted motion. In heterogeneous membranes, some probes will only be found in regions of higher membrane fluidity, while others are only found in regions of lower membrane fluidity. Partitioning preference of probes can also be a gauge of membrane fluidity. In deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the average carbon-deuterium bond orientation of the deuterated lipid gives rise to specific spectroscopic features. All three of techniques can give some measure of the time-averaged orientation of the relevant (probe) molecule, which is indicative of the rotational dynamics of the molecule. Lateral motion of molecules within the membrane can be measured by a number of fluorescence techniques: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching involves photobleaching a uniformly labelled membrane with an intense laser beam and measuring how long it takes for fluorescent probes to diffuse back into the photobleached spot. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy monitors the fluctuations in fluorescence intensity measured from a small number of probes in a small space. These fluctuations are affected by the mode of lateral diffusion of the probe. Single particle tracking involves following the trajectory of fluorescent molecules or gold particles attached to a biomolecule and applying statistical analysis to extract information about the lateral diffusion of the tracked particle.Almeida, P. and Vaz, W. (1995). \\"Lateral diffusion in membranes\\", Ch. 6, pp. 305‚Äì357 in: Lipowsky, R. and Sackmann, E. (eds.) Handbook of biological physics. Elsevier Science B.V. , Phospholipid- deficient bio-membranes A study of central linewidths of electron spin resonance spectra of thylakoid membranes and aqueous dispersions of their total extracted lipids, labeled with stearic acid spin label (having spin or doxyl moiety at 5,7,9,12,13,14 and 16th carbons, with reference to carbonyl group), reveals a fluidity gradient. Decreasing linewidth from 5th to 16th carbons represents increasing degree of motional freedom (fluidity gradient) from headgroup-side to methyl terminal in both native membranes and their aqueous lipid extract (a multilamellar liposomal structure, typical of lipid bilayer organization). This pattern points at similarity of lipid bilayer organization in both native membranes and liposomes. This observation is critical, as thylakoid membranes comprising largely galactolipids, contain only 10% phospholipid, unlike other biological membranes consisting largely of phospholipids. Proteins in chloroplast thylakoid membranes, apparently, restrict lipid fatty acyl chain segmental mobility from 9th to 16th carbons vis a vis their liposomal counterparts. Surprisingly, liposomal fatty acyl chains are more restricted at 5th and 7th carbon positions as compared at these positions in thylakoid membranes. This is explainable as due to motional restricting effect at these positions, because of steric hindrance by large chlorophyll headgroups, specially so, in liposomes. However, in native thylakoid membranes, chlorophylls are mainly complexed with proteins as light- harvesting complexes and may not largely be free to restrain lipid fluidity, as such.YashRoy R C (1990) Magnetic resonance studies of dynamic organisation of lipids in chloroplast membranes. Journal of Biosciences, vol. 15(4), pp. 281-288.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225688482_Magnetic_resonance_studies_of_dynamic_organisation_of_lipids_in_chloroplast_membranes?ev=prf_pub =Diffusion coefficients= Diffusion coefficients of fluorescent lipid analogues are about 10‚àí8cm2/s in fluid lipid membranes. In gel lipid membranes and natural biomembranes, the diffusion coefficients are about 10‚àí11cm2/s to 10‚àí9cm2/s. Charged lipid membranes The melting of charged lipid membranes, such as 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, can take place over a wide range of temperature. Within this range of temperatures, these membranes become very viscous. Biological relevance Microorganisms subjected to thermal stress are known to alter the lipid composition of their cell membrane (see homeoviscous adaptation). This is one way they can adjust the fluidity of their membrane in response to their environment.Gennis, R. B. (1989) Biomembranes: Molecular Structure and Function. Springer, . Membrane fluidity is known to affect the function of biomolecules residing within or associated with the membrane structure. For example, the binding of some peripheral proteins is dependent on membrane fluidity. Lateral diffusion (within the membrane matrix) of membrane-related enzymes can affect reaction rates. Consequently, membrane-dependent functions, such as phagocytosis and cell signalling, can be regulated by the fluidity of the cell-membrane.

Thus, batata vada literally means potato fritter. The dish consists of a mashed potato patty coated with chick pea flour, which is then deep-fried and served hot with chutney. The vada is typically around two or three inches in diameter. Across different regions of India, this dish is also known as Aloo Bonda, Aloo Vada, Batata Bonda, Batata Vada, Potato Bonda, Potato Vada. Although Maharashtrian in origin, Batata Vada is gaining popularity in the rest of India as well.Deccan Herald: Bole to yeh vada pav hai! It is also very delicious and its blend of Indian spices make it even better. Preparation The potato filling and the batter used to coat the filling are the only two components of batata vada. The potatoes are boiled, mashed coarsely and set aside. Seasoning like asafoetida, mustard seeds, chillies, onions, curry leaves are pan-fried with garlic-ginger paste, turmeric and salt, then cooked with the mashed potatoes. A thick batter is made using chick pea flour, seasoned with salt, turmeric and red chilli powder. Sometimes a small quantity of baking powder is also added to make the batter fluffier. To make the fritters, little balls of the potato mixture are coated in the batter and deep-fried in hot vegetable oil. It is possible to use red chilli paste to make the vada spicy. Batata vadas are usually accompanied by green chutney or dry chutneys, such as Shengdana Chutney (chutney in dry powder made from crushed groundnuts) and garlic-coconut chutney. Often, Jain batata vada recipes are a variation that replaces potatoes with raw bananas. Serving Batata vada is typically served very hot with green chillies and chutneys of various types. The most common way to eat this dish is in the form of Vada pav.. Batata Vada is popular with certain recipe variations in the southern Indian states too and is called Bonda.

It was (finally) shut down in the early Morning hours of January 1, 2015. It was demolished in 2018. The Aholming Transmitter, which could be received in most parts of Europe, was built between 1986 and 1988 as a Replacement for the older Erching transmitter. This became necessary as the Nighttime Operation on 207 kHz requires, according to the Geneva Frequency Plan a directional Radiation Pattern for whose Realization a second Mast was required. This Mast could not be built on the site of the former Erching, as it had to be cleared from tall Structures as in its Proximity the new Airport of Munich was under construction. The Aholming Transmitter, which entered into service on January 1, 1989, uses a directional antenna consisting of two grounded masts, which are guyed at three levels 101, 203 and 239 metres above Ground. Over the guy level, which is fixed with the Mast in a Height of 203 metres, the Transmission Power was fed into each Mast. Therefore, from the Top of the helix building close to the mast three conductor ropes ran upward to a point of the 203 metre guy level, which was situated 110 metre away from its anchor point of the Mast. Both Masts, which were equipped in 6 levels with flight safety Lamps were nearly of the same height to wavelength ratio as those of Sender Donebach (0.1829). The distance between them was 483 metres. During Daytime, the directional Pattern of Aholming transmitter showed only a slight maximum toward Northwest and Southeast. At Nighttime, when Transmission Power was to be reduced to 250 kW and much further suppressed into the East, to not interfere with a former Transmitter being operated at Kiev on the same Frequency, both Masts were fed with a Phase Shift of 117¬∞. By this Measure, a strong Directional Radiation Pattern occurs with a Power Reduction to 2.5 kW in Azimuth ranges between 72 and 88¬∞, 130 kW in azimuth range between 115 and 160¬∞ and 100 kW between 160 and 230¬∞. The Transmitter Building of Aholming transmitter is 420 metres away from both Masts. It has an area of 1300 m*m and a volume of 6725 m*m*m. The Transmitter consists of 2 250 kW-units, which are mostly identical to the devices used at Sender Donebach. They have used dynamic Amplitude Modulation, which was generated by using pulse-width Modulation, a technique also used in modern static inverters to efficiently save Energy for Transmission.

In 1945, he was party to the agreement that the church in the Mandatory Territory of New Guinea (i.e. the north of his diocese) should be wholly ceded to the Diocese of New Guinea (the agreement was enacted 1 July 1949). His appointment as Bishop of Whitby (suffragan bishop in the Diocese of York) having been announced 20 December 1946, he undertook a farewell tour of his diocese and of New Zealand, he vacated his See and departed for Britain on 2 April 1947. Return to England He arrived in London on 10 April and had furlough before taking up his new post. Baddeley was a popular figure with the austere Archbishop of York, Cyril Garbett, but Garbett did not support him for the post of diocesan bishop of Blackburn.Baddeley is mentioned several times in Garbett's biography by Charles Smyth,Hodder and Stoughton,1959‚ÄòGreat vigour and personal zeal.

File re Blackburn 1954 However,the key figure in the appointments process was the PM,Winston Churchill,who would have been impressed by Baddeley's Record in both World Wars. So,on 13 August 1954, his nomination as Bishop of Blackburn was announced, and he took up the See on 10 October. He died in post at Bishop's House, Salesbury (Clayton-le-Dale, Lancashire) and his funeral was at Blackburn Cathedral on 15 February 1960, officiated by Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of York. Baddeley is listed in the Calendar of saints (Church of the Province of Melanesia). Baddeley's grandson is Jeremy Greaves, Assistant Bishop for the Northern Region in the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane since 2017.

Along with CBGB, the Whisky a Go Go, and selected others, it was instrumental in launching American punk rock and new wave music. The 40 Watt Club was the primary performance space for numerous \\"Athens bands\\", including Pylon, R.E.M., Love Tractor, Dreams So Real, Guadalcanal Diary, The Primates, Modern Skirts, and others. Its DIY ethos and informality were instrumental in the fostering of punk rock and a \\"scene\\" in Athens, GA. In more recent years, the club has been the home- base for such nationally renowned local bands as of Montreal, Reptar, Drive-By Truckers, and The Whigs. The club's owner since 1987 has been Barrie Buck. Background The 40 Watt Club had its origins as Curtis Crowe's 171 College Avenue loft back in 1978. Bill Tabor and Crowe joked that it was a 40 Watt Club due to the single 40-watt bulb which hung from the ceiling. Crowe's first party in his space, on October 31,Venue - 40Watt.com featured his band Strictly American, a group of friends from Marietta, Georgia, which included members of the future Guadalcanal Diary. Crowe and Tabor would hang out in his loft upstairs and listen to Michael Lachowski and Randy Bewley practice the same riff over and over again in the space directly below. Crowe eventually knocked on their practice space and asked if they could use a drummer and Pylon was born. During Pylon's subsequent tours of the Northeast, Crowe theorized that opening a real club on a shoestring budget was possible. He did so early the following year. In May 1980, Crowe and his partner Paul Scales moved the \\"club\\" a few doors south to a space above a sandwich shop at 101 College Avenue and renamed the club the \\"40 Watt East\\". It opened with Crowe still making last-minute additions to the bar and stage. The Side Effects played that first night and Pylon on the second. It was an instant smash with the local youth of Athens. The floors had to be reinforced with removable beams due to the intense dancing that took place. In 1982, with new partner Steve Allen, Scales migrated the club to a larger space at 256 West Clayton Street. Amenities such as a stage and hot water were added, as was a second bathroom. True to the 40 Watt method it was assembled with found materials (including toilet and sink) and volunteer labor. Local artist and musician David Hannon Pierce created the first iteration of the club's famous logo, as well as all the updated variations still in use. Doug Hoechst bought the club from Allen and Scales and, in 1984, moved it to 382 East Broad Street and renamed it \\"40 Watt Club Uptown\\". The 40 Watt Uptown was large and professional, and it was a major stop for underground independent music acts in the 1980s. In 1987, when rents increased on the space, new owners Jared Bailey and Barrie Buck (then-wife of R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck), moved the club back to its West Clayton Street location. At the same time, the formerly small, spare competing club, The Uptown Lounge, expanded to a much larger space (the Georgia Theater). Therefore, with Uptown Lounge taking over as the high-capacity venue, there was again a market for a small club that would focus on local acts. In 1991, the club moved to its fifth and current location at 285 West Washington Street, the former Potter's House Thrift store building.

The name is misleading in more than one respect; the word \\"zuta\\" (small) would seem to indicate that it is a shorter version of the treatise \\"Derekh Eretz Rabbah,\\" which is not the case, the two having little in common. Also, \\"Derekh Eretz\\" is a very unsuitable name for a collection of ethical teachings such as form the substance of the treatise. However, this name is ancient: Rashi called the treatise \\"Massekhet Derekh Eretz,\\"Commentary to Berachot 4a while the Tosafists likewise called it \\"Hilkot Derekh Eretz\\".Commentary to Bekhorot 44b The designation \\"zuta\\" is probably of later. Versions In the Talmud editions the treatise consists of nine sections (\\"perakim\\"), to which the Section on Peace (\\"Perek ha-Shalom\\") is added as a supplement. The Halakhot Gedoloted. A. Hildesheimer, pp. 644‚Äì652 gives another version; here the same material is in two parts‚Äî(1) \\"Derekh Eretz Zuta,\\" corresponding to sections 5‚Äì8, and (2) \\"Derekh Eretz Rabbah,\\" containing sections 1-4 and 9. There are two manuscript copies with this division in the Bodleian,Nos. 120 and 380 in A. Neubauer's catalogue as well as a Cairo genizah fragment;Jew. Quart. Rev. 10:660 but in the latter, the first four sections are under the title \\"Yir'at Chet.\\" Qirqisani (a 10th-century Karaite) cites a passage from the fourth section under that title.Jew. Quart. Rev. 7:698 A third version is that in Machzor Vitry,ed. Horwitz, pp. 721‚Äì723 where the first part of the eighth and the whole of the ninth section are given under the title \\"Hilkot Darkan shel Talmidei ·∏§akamim.\\" It is noteworthy that in the Talmud editions, sections 4-8 are marked as having been taken from the Machzor Vitry. It should also be mentioned that the Siddur Rab Amram gives only the first and fourth sections, which is probably because the second and third were not included in the ritual. Summary of Contents Apart from this external evidence, a closer examination shows that the work consists of three different collections: 1‚Äì4, 5‚Äì8, 9. However, it has a certain unity in that it consists almost exclusively of exhortations to self-examination and meekness and of rules of conduct, and urges temperance, resignation, gentleness, patience, respect for age, readiness to forgive, and, finally, the moral and social duties of a talmid chacham. It is written in the form of separate, short maxims arranged as Pirkei Avot, but differing in that they are anonymous. The compiler attempted to arrange the maxims according to external characteristics, the order followed being determined by the initial word, and by the number of maxims. Several precepts which begin with the same word are put together even when they are not at all related in subject-matter;Compare The Wisdom of Ben Sira, ed. S. Schechter, vi. 1-20, where twenty sayings begin with ◊ê◊ú especially are they thus combined into groups of four, five, or seven maxims, numbers which serve to aid in memorizing the passages. How far the compiler was able to carry out his principle cannot be judged from the text in its present condition; and to ascertain the original form of the treatise it is necessary critically to reconstruct the text. The following analysis of contents is based on such a reconstruction. The first section begins with introductory remarks on the duties and proper conduct of a \\"disciple of the wise\\"; then follow seven teachings, each a precept in four parts, which, however, are often confused in the text as it now exists. The order is: # ◊î◊ï◊ô # ◊ê◊ú ‚Äì which teaching is to be read according to Avot of Rabbi Natan (ed. S. Schechter) 26:83 # ◊ê◊ù # ◊ê◊ú (the following saying, beginning with ◊ê◊ù, belongs to No. 3, while the next ◊ê◊ú teaching is the fourth part of No. 4) # ◊î◊¢◊ë◊® (the two missing parts to be supplied from Abot 2:4) # ◊ê◊î◊ï◊ë and its opposite ◊î◊®◊ó◊ß # ◊ê◊ú ‚Äì originally four teachings as shown by the Vatican MSS. in Goldberg and Coronel's version and as confirmed by the parallels in Ab. R. N.;ed. S. Schechter, 26:82, 33:36 the concluding ◊î◊®◊ó◊ß teaching belongs to No. 6. The three aggadic teachings which form the conclusion of the first section are a later addition. The second section begins like the first, emphasizing particularly the duties of the \\"disciple of the wise.\\" After a series of admonitions concerning only the student, there follow, to the end of the section, maxims of a general nature for people in the most varied walks of life. These are also arranged in seven teachings, each beginning with the word ◊î◊ï◊ô, which word also comes before ◊ú◊û◊ï◊ì ◊ú◊î◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊í◊ï◊û◊ú ◊ë◊ò◊ï◊ë◊î .Compare Ab. R. N. 41 Then follow seven beginning with ◊ê◊ú, and seven with ◊ê◊ù. In the third section the regular arrangement can be recognized beginning with the maxim ◊ê◊ù ◊®◊§◊ô◊™. There are three teachings each with ◊ê◊ù and ◊î◊ï◊ô; and as many with ◊™◊ó◊ú◊™ and ◊ê◊ù. The following teachings probably belong to section four, and concern only the conduct of the student. The paragraph beginning with the words ◊ê◊ú ◊™◊ê◊û◊® ◊ê◊ô◊©, which, as is to be seen from the Siddur Rab Amram, consists of four parts, concludes the fourth section, which is the end of the \\"Yir'at Chet.\\" From the fourth section to the eighth is a collection of maxims arranged on the same plan. The eighth section contains eight maxims beginning with ◊õ◊ú, but the initial and concluding maxims are not relevant to the proper matter of section. The ninth section is a well-ordered collection of twenty-eight maxims arranged in four paragraphs; seven of these maxims begin with ◊ê◊î◊ï◊ë, seven with ◊î◊ï◊ô, and fourteen with ◊ê◊ù. Date of Composition The date of composition can only be conjectured. It is almost certain that sections 5-8 are the work of one editor, who lived after the completion of the Babylonian Talmud. One needs only to compare the maxim ◊ú◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù (in 5:2) with Sanhedrin 23a and Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael Mishpa·π≠im 20 to see that the compiler had the Talmud before him. The next maxim is a combination of Eruvin 65b and Avot of Rabbi Natan, ed. ◊õ◊ú ◊î◊û◊™◊†◊ë◊ú S. Schechter, 32:68. In addition, Avot of Rabbi Natan 8,(ed. Schechter, 22 46) Midrash Mishlei 9:9, Pesikta Rabbati 8, ◊õ◊ú ◊ñ◊û◊ü,ed. S. Buber, 44b and probably Derekh Eretz Rabbah were also used. As already mentioned, the Spanish version of the Halakhot Gedolot, probably made about 1000, adopted these four sections as a complete treatise; hence one would not be far wrong in setting the 9th century as the date of composition. The first four sections date from a much earlier period. From their contents they may even have been an independent collection already in existence at the time of the Tannaim. At any rate this collection contains much that is old, even if it can not be proved that the Megillat ·∏§asidim, which is cited in Abot de-Rabbi Natan,ed. Schechter, 26:52 is identical with the treatise under discussion. The ninth section, originally, perhaps, a small collection of maxims, is more modern than the first and older than the second part of the treatise. The conclusion of the ninth chapter, which deals with peace, led to a Section on Peace (\\"Pere·∏≥ ha-Shalom\\") being added to Derekh Eretz Zutta. In this work, various sayings concerning peace taken from different Midrashim (especially from the Midrash to Numbers 6:26) are placed together. This tenth (supplementary) section is comparatively a very late product, and is not found in Ma·∏•zor Vitry, in Halakot Gedolot, nor in the manuscripts. Importance of the Treatise Besides Pirkei Avot, this treatise is the only collection of precepts from the period of the Talmud and the Midrashim, and is therefore of great importance in any estimate of the earliest ethical views of the old rabbis. Zunz appropriately characterizes the treatise: \\"The Derek Ere·∫ì, Zu·π≠a, which is meant to be a mirror for scholars, is full of high moral teachings and pithy worldly wisdom which philosophers of to-day could study to advantage.\\" The treatise deals mainly with man's relation to man, and is moral rather than religious in nature. A few quotations from it will illustrate its character: *\\"If others speak evil of you, let the greatest thing seem unimportant in your eyes; but if you have spoken evil of others, let the least word seem important.\\" *\\"If you have done much good, let it seem little in your eyes, and say: 'Not of mine own have I done this, but of that good which has come to me through others'; but let a small kindness done to you appear great.\\" The treatise was much read, and the fact that it went through so many hands partly accounts for the chaotic condition of the text. Scholars of the 18th century did much, by means of their glosses and commentaries, toward making possible an understanding of the text, but a critical edition is still needed (as of 1906).

It connects U.S. Route 59 (US 59) in Heavener to the Arkansas state line, where it becomes Arkansas Highway 28. It has no lettered spur routes. SH-128 was first added to the state highway system circa 1956. It has been realigned once, to better match up with roads across the Arkansas line. Route description State Highway 128 begins at US-59/US-270 in Heavener. From the terminus south of downtown, the highway follows West Avenue I to East 1st Street, where it turns south, running parallel to US-59/US-270. Highway 128 then curves east and exits Heavener. For the remainder of its route, SH-128 runs mostly parallel to a spur from the Kansas City Southern rail line; the road crosses the tracks once, just east of the Heavener city limit. SH-128 follows the valley of the Poteau River through east-central Le Flore County, running between the river and Poteau Mountain. At the highway's approximate midpoint, the route passes through unincorporated Forrester. From here, SH-128 follows a generally east-northeast heading before crossing the state line into Scott County, Arkansas. The road continues east toward Bates as Arkansas Highway 28. History State Highway 128 first appears on the 1957 edition of the official Oklahoma state highway map. The route has always been a paved highway. Initially, it did not connect to Highway 28 upon crossing the Arkansas state line. The route was realigned to directly connect to Highway 28 by 1961.

Her design did not change much during development, with the only major difference being a change in headgear. She is one of the main characters of the 1995 game Chrono Trigger by Square where she is known as a brilliant inventor in the canon of the series. She is the childhood friend of the protagonist Crono and is instrumental in advancing the story multiple times. She also appears in Chrono Cross as the caretaker to one of its protagonists, Kid. She has received praise for being a positive example of a female scientist in video games, with one critic suggesting that she is a positive influence for aspiring female scientists and engineers. She has also been discussed as a character defying gender stereotypes, due to her style of clothing and high level of intelligence. A scene where her mother loses the use of her legs and Lucca has the opportunity to use time travel to prevent this has been the subject of positive reception, both for the possibility of failure and in how it impacts Lucca emotionally, regardless of success. Concept and creation Lucca Ashtear's design was created by Akira Toriyama. Hers had been fairly consistent through development, though she wore a headband instead of a cap. Her personality is described as dependable but boisterous. She is a genius scientist who creates multiple advanced technologies, including teleporting and time travel technology. Director Yoshinori Kitase was responsible for the creation of extra scenes featuring Lucca. Chrono Trigger story planner and script writer Masato Kat≈ç noted that Lucca was the character in the game that he felt most emotionally attached to, due to her kindness, dignity, and occasional obliviousness. He also identified the first time Robo and Lucca met as one of his favorite events in the game. When discussing a theoretical game to follow Chrono Cross, Kat≈ç discussed an idea where Kid, Lucca's adopted daughter, went on a quest to save her, Crono, and Marle. He ultimately rejected this idea due to his principle that \\"the past is the past\\". One significant scene relating to Lucca has her going back in time to save her mother from having her legs crushed, a task which may succeed or fail depending on players' ability. Originally, it was going to be impossible to prevent her injuries. While the solution to the scene involves inputting L, A, R, and A in the English version, the original Japanese version required players to input L, A, L, and A, which did not appear to have an easily discernible explanation since Lara's name is written in Japanese. In the Japanese version, past Lucca has letters written in the third person and initially wants to be a \\"normal bride\\" and thus dislikes science. If present Lucca fails to rescue her mother, she begins speaking in the third person; if she succeeds, her writing is a mixture of the first and third person. No matter whether she succeeds or fails, Lucca is driven to learn science to make sure something like this cannot happen again. In the English version, the bride aspect is dropped and replaced with an annoyance that her father is too busy with science to spend time with her. In the original Japanese version, fellow playable character Ayla suggests an attraction to Lucca due to her power, causing Lucca to grow defensive and saying that she does not \\"swing that way\\". In the English Super Nintendo version, the suggestion that Ayla was attracted to Lucca was removed and replaced with showing respect to her for her power. Chrono Trigger DS localizer Tom Slattery changed this English localization to be close to the original without explicit reference to Ayla's attraction to Lucca. Appearances Lucca first appears in the Super NES video game Chrono Trigger. She is the friend of protagonist Crono, both of whom live in the year 1000 AD, where a Millennial Fair is being held. She invites Crono to witness her teleportation demonstration at the fair, and he brings a new companion, Marle, along. Marle winds up getting sent back in time to 600 AD while attempting to use the teleporter due to an interaction between her pendant and the machine, resulting in Crono going after her with Lucca's help. She later joins them using a time travel device she created and helps Crono rescue Marle. She returns to 1000 AD with Crono and Marle and helps Crono escape prison when he's mistakenly taken prisoner and sentenced to death for kidnapping Marle. The three are chased and escape through time into 2300 AD, where they discover a post-apocalypse and a robot named Robo who she repairs and accept into the team. They also learn that the cause of the apocalypse was a creature named Lavos who emerged from the Earth in 1999, and they vow to stop this from happening. They arrive at the End of Time, where Lucca gains the ability to use Fire magic. At this point, Lucca may be left out of the story for much of the game after this point due to time travel only allowing three entities to travel at a time. After aiding in the growth of a forest, Lucca discovers a red time portal that sends her back to the day where her mother lost the use of her legs due to an accident with a machine of her father's. If present Lucca is able to input the correct password to deactivate the machine it stops and her mother in the present is no longer handicapped. She bonds with Robo following returning to the present, who tries to console her. When Crono is killed by Lavos, Lucca is visibly upset and feels guilty about not being able to help him. Lucca and the party eventually managed to defeat Lavos. In one ending of the game, Lucca is saddened over the possibility that Robo may cease to exist due to changing history. In the PlayStation release of Chrono Trigger, one of the endings show Lucca finding an abandoned child who she takes in. This child turns out to be the character Kid from the sequel Chrono Cross. Lucca serves in a supporting role in this game as the owner of an orphanage, which she converted her house into. The game's antagonist, Lynx, killed her and burns down the orphanage in pursuit of a powerful artifact called the Frozen Flame. Following her death, Kid receives a letter that Lucca wrote to her about the ethical ramifications of their time travel. She makes a cameo appearance in the PlayStation video game Xenogears. A figurine of Crono, Robo, and Lucca was shown at Toy Fair 2010. Reception Since appearing in Chrono Trigger, Lucca has been met with positive reception, particularly as a positive example of a female scientist in video games. Jamin Warren of PBS Game/Show listed her as one of the best female video game characters due to her scientific prowess which he feels can inspire future generations of female scientists and engineers. Even Saathoff of UGO Networks included her in their list of the best video game companions due to her mixture of genius and youth. Author Michael P. Williams discussed her agency in Chrono Trigger, contrasting Lucca to Marle, particularly that Marle's advancement of the plot is passive while Lucca is a catalyst for multiple events. He goes on to discuss her design, which he matches with a stereotype described by journalist Miki Tanikawa of a female scientist who does not care about beauty. He goes onto discuss her status as a mother, questioning whether this takes away from her as a scientist. Loraine of Autostraddle similarly praised her agency in the story and for being a rare example of a fictional woman who works in a STEM field. Tom Auxier of Nightmare Mode discussed her growth from being selfishly obsessed with science to becoming a hero once she realizes she has the capacity to protect the world. Author Madeleine Brookman noted Lucca's defiance of gender expectations, citing Lucca's non-feminine clothing, agency, and a level of brilliance that enables her to deal with advanced technology. Jeremy Parish for IGN suggested Lucca as a possible addition to the Dissidia Final Fantasy fighting game series. The scene depicting Lucca going back in time to when her mother became handicapped from a machinery accident has been covered by journalists and in academic studies. McGee Maxwell of GamesRadar+ found that it contrasts with the rest of Chrono Trigger due to being time-sensitive and permanent. They also discuss the stress players experience from guiding Lucca through this. Chad Concelmo of Destructoid suggested that one of the reasons it makes such an impact is that players can fail to save Lucca's mother. It was one of his favorite video game moments and one that made them feel for Lucca, particularly due to her being upset regardless of the outcome. The scene was covered in detail in the essay Playable Tragedy: Ergodic Tragedy in Squaresoft's Chrono Trigger by Luis Torres Meza. Luis uses the scene as an example of an argument made by author Jesper Juul in his 2013 work The Art of Failure, where Juul argues that video games allow for players to be complicit in what happens in a story, thus providing a \\"new type of tragedy\\". Juul suggests that her view on robots ‚Äì that robots do not behave evilly without human influence ‚Äì may have been influenced by the incident. Madeleine Brookman criticized the removal of dialogue in the English localization about Lucca's depression by Robo, feeling it made it more difficult for players to understand Robo's affection for Lucca.

It is a branch of ethnozoology and so of the wider field of ethnobiology. Ethnoornithology is an interdisciplinary subject and combines anthropological, cognitive and linguistic perspectives with natural scientific approaches to the description and interpretation of people's knowledge and use of birds. Like ethnoscience and other cognate terms, \\"ethnoornithology\\" is sometimes used narrowly to refer to people's practice rather than the study of that practice. The broader focus is on how birds are perceived, used and managed in human societies, including their use for food, medicine and personal adornment, as well as their use in divination and ritual. Applied ethnoornithological research is also starting to play an increasingly important role in the development of conservation initiatives.  History of ethnoornithology  The work of Ralph Bulmer in New Guinea, culminating in his collaboration with Ian Saem Majnep in writing Birds of My Kalam Country (1977), set a new standard for ethnoornithological research, and this book has deservedly become a classic of modern ethno-ornithology.  Approaches to ethnoornithology   Ethnoornithology and conservation  Like other branches of ethnozoology, ethnoornithology has been long undervalued as a resource for conservation, though this is now beginning to change. Mark Bonta's Seven Names for the Bellbird (2003), which highlights the importance of local traditions and practices relating to birds for the future of biodiversity conservation in Honduras, and Ricardo Rozzi's Multi-ethnic Bird Guide of the Subantarctic Forests of South America (2003), which focuses on the integration of traditional ornithological knowledge and environmental ethics in southern Chile, provide good examples of this trend. Soma (2015) pointed out that ethnoornithological knowledge of falconers contribute to conservation for local avifauna (especially focusing on Kazakh eagle masters). This realisation is the basis for founding the Ethno-ornithology World Archive (EWA), a collaborative project between Oxford University (linking the Department of Zoology and School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography) and BirdLife International.  Professional associations  The Society of Ethnobiology, which publishes the Journal of Ethnobiology, provides a general forum for ethnobiological - including ethnoornthological - research. In January 2006 the Ethnoornithology Research & Study Group (ERSG) was established \\"to provide a clearinghouse, information source and discussion point for people interested in the study of, research about and application of indigenous bird knowledge\\".

It was built to house a particular image or form of the goddess, a meteoric stone brought from Greek Asia Minor to Rome in 204 BC at the behest of an oracle and temporarily housed in the goddess of Victory's Palatine temple. The new temple was dedicated on 11 April 191 BC, and Magna Mater's first Megalesia festival was held on the temple's proscenium.(Liv. loc. cit.; Fasti Praenestini apud Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum I2 pp235, 314‚Äë315, cf. p251 = VI.32498; Fast. Ant. ap. NS 1921, 91) and celebrated in front of the temple (Cicero, De haruspicum responsis 24; cf. for site Ovid Fasti II.55; Mart. VII.73.3). The temple was sited on the high western slope of the Palatine, overlooking the valley of the Circus Maximus and facing the temple of Ceres on the slopes of the Aventine. It was accessible via a long upward flight of steps from the flattened area or proscenium below, where the goddess's festival games and plays were staged. The goddess's altar was visible both from the proscenium and the temple's interior. The original temple burned down in 111 BC, and was restored by one Metellus, possibly Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius.Ovid gives simply Metellus. Roller, 1999, p. 291 states that \\"it has been plausibly argued that this was C. Mettelus Caprarius, who would have built the temple with funds from military spoils and dedicated it in 101 BC\\". It burned on a further two occasions in the early Imperial era, and was restored each time by Augustus; his second rebuilding was probably the more sumptuous of the two.Roller, 1999, pp.309 - 310. The temple was 33.18 metres deep, and its frontage 17.10 metres wide, accessed by steps of the same width. It was built in the prostyle hexastyle of the Corinthian order. The whole was supported by a massively walled, stucco-faced podium of irregular, thickly mortared tufa and peperino. A coin of Faustina the Elder is thought to show the same temple, with curved roof and a flight of steps. At the top of the steps is a statue of Cybele enthroned, with a turreted crown and lion attendants. This is consistent with a colossal, fragmentary statue of the goddess, found within the temple precincts. The goddess' meteoric stone may have been kept on a pedestal within the temple cella; or incorporated into the face of a statue and set on a pediment.For the complete description of the ruins and argument for identification, see Mitt. 1895, 1‚Äë28; 1906, 277; for the coins, ib. 1908, 368‚Äë374; in general, HJ 51‚Äë4; Rosch. II.1666‚Äë1667; Gilb. III.104‚Äë107; Graillot, Cybele (Bibl. Ec. Fran√ß. 107, 320‚Äë326; SScR 247‚Äë249). The temple pediment is shown on the Ara Pietatis relief, which represents Magna Mater in aniconic mode; her empty throne and crown are flanked by two figures of Attis reclining on tympanons; and by two lions who eat from bowls, as if tamed by the goddess' unseen presence.The scene probably represents a sellisternium, a form of banquet usually reserved for goddesses, in accordance with Rome's \\"greek rites\\". The temple remained in use until the late 4th century. It was destroyed in 394 AD, on the orders of Emperor Theodosius I during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

Although part of a movement that included Jews and rejected antisemitism, he privately displayed a contemptuous attitude toward Jews on various occasions that were witnessed by his contemporaries, and are documented by historical sources. As the leader of the Soviet Union, he promoted repressive policies that conspicuously impacted Jews and, according to his successor Nikita Khrushchev and others, he fomented the doctors' plot as a pretext for further anti-Jewish repressions. Early years Born in Gori, Georgia (then in the Russian Empire) and educated at an Orthodox seminary in Tiflis (Tbilisi) before becoming a professional revolutionary and a Marxist around the start of the 20th century, Stalin appears unlikely to have been stirred by antisemitism in his early years and met only a limited number of revolutionaries of Jewish origin during his first years of political activity.Pinkus, Benjamin (1990). The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 143‚Äì144. . Although active in the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, he did not attend a party congress until 1905. Although Jews were active among both the Social Democratic Bolshevik and the Menshevik factions, Jews were more prominent among the Mensheviks. Stalin took note of the ethnic proportions represented on each side, as seen from a 1907 report on the Congress published in the Bakinsky rabochy (Baku Workman), which quoted a coarse joke about \\"a small pogrom\\" (–ø–æ–≥—Ä–æ–º—á–∏–∫) Stalin attributed to then- Bolshevik Grigory Aleksinsky: > Not less interesting is the composition of the congress from the standpoint > of nationalities.

On the other hand, the > overwhelming majority of the Bolshevik faction consists of Russians, after > which come Jewsnot counting of course the Poles and Lettsand then Georgians, > etc. For this reason one of the Bolsheviks observed in jest (it seems > Comrade Aleksinsky) that the Mensheviks are a Jewish faction and the > Bolsheviks a genuine Russian faction, so it would not be a bad idea for us > Bolsheviks to arrange a small pogrom in the party. 1917 to 1930 Although the Bolsheviks regarded all religious activity as counter-scientific superstition and a remnant of the old pre-communist order, the new political order established by Lenin's Soviet after the Russian Revolution ran counter to the centuries of antisemitism under the Romanovs. The Council of People's Commissars adopted a 1918 decree condemning all antisemitism and calling on the workers and peasants to combat it.Pinkus, Benjamin (1990). The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 85. . Lenin continued to speak out against antisemitism.Lenin, V. I.

Information campaigns against antisemitism were conducted in the Red Army and in the workplaces, and a provision forbidding the incitement of propaganda against any ethnicity became part of Soviet law. State-sponsored institutions of secular Yiddish culture, such as the Moscow State Jewish Theater, were established in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union during this time, as were institutions for other minorities. As People's Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin was the cabinet member responsible for minority affairs. In 1922, Stalin was elected the first-ever General Secretary of the party‚Äîa post not yet regarded as the highest in the Soviet government. Lenin began to criticize Stalin shortly thereafter. In his December 1922 letters, the ailing Lenin (whose health left him incapacitated in 1923‚Äì1924) criticized Stalin and Dzerzhinsky for their chauvinistic attitude toward the Georgian nation during the Georgian Affair.Lenin, V.

I. \\"'Last Testament' Letters to the Congress\\". In Lenin Collected Works, Volume 36. Moscow: Progress Publishers. pp. 593‚Äì611. Marxists Internet Archive. Retrieved 23 February 2011. After the incapacitated Lenin's death on 21 January 1924, the party officially maintained the principle of collective leadership, but Stalin soon outmaneuvered his rivals in the Central Committee's Politburo. At first collaborating with Jewish and half-Jewish Politburo members Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev against Jewish arch-rival Leon Trotsky, Stalin succeeded in marginalizing Trotsky. By 1929, Stalin had also effectively marginalized Zinoviev and Kamenev as well, compelling both to submit to his authority. The intransigent Trotsky was forced into exile. When Boris Bazhanov, Stalin's personal secretary who had defected to France in 1928, produced a memoir critical of Stalin in 1930, he alleged that Stalin made crude antisemitic outbursts even before Lenin's death.Kun, Mikl√≥s, Stalin: An Unknown Portrait, Central European University Press, 2003, , p. 287. 1930s =Stalin's 1931 condemnation of antisemitism= On 12 January 1931, Stalin gave the following answer to an inquiry on the subject of the Soviet attitude toward antisemitism from the Jewish News Agency in the United States: > National and racial chauvinism is a vestige of the misanthropic customs > characteristic of the period of cannibalism. Anti-semitism, as an extreme > form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism. > Anti-semitism is of advantage to the exploiters as a lightning conductor > that deflects the blows aimed by the working people at capitalism.

Works, Vol. 13, July 1930 ‚Äì January 1934. Moscow: > Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1954. p. 30. =Establishment of Jewish Autonomous Oblast= To offset the growing Jewish national and religious aspirations of Zionism and to successfully categorize Soviet Jews under Stalin's nationality policy, an alternative to the Land of Israel was established with the help of Komzet and OZET in 1928. The Jewish Autonomous Oblast with the center in Birobidzhan in the Russian Far East was to become a \\"Soviet Zion\\". Yiddish, rather than \\"reactionary\\" Hebrew, would be the national language, and proletarian socialist literature and arts would replace Judaism as the quintessence of culture. Despite a massive domestic and international state propaganda campaign, the Jewish population there never reached 30% (as of 2003 it was only about 1.2%). The experiment ground to a halt in the mid-1930s, during Stalin's first campaign of purges, as local leaders were not spared during the purges. =Great Purge= Stalin's harshest period of mass repression, the Great Purge (or Great Terror), was launched in 1936‚Äì1937 and involved the execution of over a half-million Soviet citizens accused of treason, terrorism, and other anti-Soviet crimes. The campaign of purges prominently targeted Stalin's former opponents and other Old Bolsheviks, and included a large-scale purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, repression of the kulak peasants, Red Army leaders, and ordinary citizens accused of conspiring against Stalin's administration.Figes, Orlando (2007). The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia. New York: Metropolitan. pp. 227‚Äì315 . Although many of Great Purge victims were ethnic or religious Jews, they were not specifically targeted as an ethnic group during this campaign according to Mikhail Baitalsky,Baitalsky, Mikhail \\"Russkii evrei vchera i segodnia\\", unpublished manuscript.

According to some historians, antisemitic trends in the Kremlin's policies were fueled by the struggle against Leon Trotsky.Etinger, Iakov (1995). \\"The Doctors' Plot: Stalin's Solution to the Jewish Question\\". In Yaacov Ro'i, Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union. London: Frank Cass. , pp. 103‚Äì6.Rappaport, Helen, Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion, ABC-CLIO, 1999 , p. 297. In the late 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s far fewer Jews were appointed to positions of power in the state apparatus than previously, with a sharp drop in Jewish representation in senior positions evident from around the time of the beginning of the late 1930s rapprochement with Nazi Germany. The percentage of Jews in positions of power dropped to 6% in 1938, and to 5% in 1940. =Relocation and deportation of Jews during the war= Following the Soviet invasion of Poland, Stalin began a policy of deporting Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Oblast and other parts of Siberia. Throughout the war, similar movements were executed in regions considered vulnerable to Nazi invasion with the various target ethnic groups of the Nazi genocide. When these populations reached their destinations, work was oftentimes arduous and they were subjected to poor conditions due to lack of resources caused by the war effort.How Joseph Stalin (Inadvertently) Saved Some Of Poland‚Äôs Jews, http://www.ibtimes.com/how-joseph-stalin-inadvertently-saved-some-polands- jews-1099571Saved by Deportation: An Unknown Odyssey of Polish Jews (2006), https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/424044/Saved-by-Deportation-An-Unknown- Odyssey-of-Polish-Jews/overview After World War II The experience of the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of approximately six million Jews in Europe under Nazi occupation, and left millions more homeless and displaced, contributed to growing concern about the situation of the Jewish people worldwide. However, the trauma breathed new life into the traditional idea of a common Jewish peoplehood and became a catalyst for the revival of the Zionist idea of creating a Jewish state in the Middle East. The Jewish Autonomous Oblast experienced a revival as the Soviet government sponsored the migration of as many as ten thousand Eastern European Jews to Birobidzhan in 1946‚Äì1948.Weinberg, Robert (1998). Stalin's Forgotten Zion: Birobidzhan and the Making of a Soviet Jewish Homeland. Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 72‚Äì75. . In early 1946, the Council of Ministers of the USSR announced a plan to build new infrastructure, and Mikhail Kalinin, a champion of the Birobidzhan project since the late 1920s, stated that he still considered the region as a \\"Jewish national state\\" that could be revived through \\"creative toil.\\" From late 1944, Joseph Stalin adopted a pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be socialist and would speed the decline of British influence in the Middle East.Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews (1987) p.527 Accordingly, in November 1947, the Soviet Union, together with the other Soviet bloc countries voted in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine,UN General Assembly Resolution 181 Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs which paved the way for the creation of the State of Israel. On May 17, 1948, three days after Israel declared its independence, the Soviet Union officially granted de jure recognition of Israel,Recognition of Israel JSTOR - The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 4, No. 3, July 1948. becoming only the second country to recognise the Jewish state (preceded only by the United States' de facto recognition) and the first country to grant Israel de jure recognition. Also in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War supported Israel with weaponry supplied via Czechoslovakia. Nonetheless, Stalin began a new purge with repressing his wartime allies, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. In January 1948, Solomon Mikhoels was assassinated on Stalin's personal orders in Minsk. His murder was disguised as a hit-and-run car accident. Mikhoels was taken to MGB dacha and killed, along with his non-Jewish colleague Golubov-Potapov, under supervision of Stalin's Deputy Minister of State Security Sergei Ogoltsov. Their bodies were then dumped on a road-side in Minsk.Robert Conquest. Reflections on a Ravaged Century, Norton, (2000) , page 101 Despite Stalin's willingness to support Israel early on, various historians suppose that antisemitism in the late 1940s and early 1950s was motivated by Stalin's possible perception of Jews as a potential \\"fifth column\\" in light of a pro-Western Israel in the Middle East. Orlando Figes suggests that > After the foundation of Israel in May 1948, and its alignment with the USA > in the Cold War, the 2 million Soviet Jews, who had always remained loyal to > the Soviet system, were portrayed by the Stalinist regime as a potential > fifth column. Despite his personal dislike of Jews, Stalin had been an early > supporter of a Jewish state in Palestine, which he had hoped to turn into a > Soviet satellite in the Middle East. But as the leadership of the emerging > state proved hostile to approaches from the Soviet Union, Stalin became > increasingly afraid of pro-Israeli feeling among Soviet Jews. His fears > intensified as a result of Golda Meir's arrival in Moscow in the autumn of > 1948 as the first Israeli ambassador to the USSR. On her visit to a Moscow > synagogue on Yom Kippur (13 October), thousands of people lined the streets, > many of them shouting Am Yisroel Chai! (The People of Israel Live!)a > traditional affirmation of national renewal to Jews throughout the world but > to Stalin a dangerous sign of 'bourgeois Jewish nationalism' that subverted > the authority of the Soviet state.Figes, Orlando (2008). The Whisperers: > Private Life in Stalin's Russia. New York: Picador USA. p. 493. . Historians Albert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy observe that \\"When, in October 1948, during the high holy days, thousands of Jews rallied around Moscow's central synagogue to honor Golda Myerson, the first Israeli ambassador, the authorities became especially alarmed at the signs of Jewish disaffection.Lindemann, Albert S. & Richard S. Levy (2010). Antisemitism: A History. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 187. .\\" Jeffrey Veidlinger writes that \\"By October 1948, it was obvious that Mikhoels was by no means the sole advocate of Zionism among Soviet Jews. The revival of Jewish cultural expression during the war had fostered a general sense of boldness among the Jewish masses. Many Jews remained oblivious to the growing Zhdanovshchina and the threat to Soviet Jews that the brewing campaign against 'rootless cosmopolitans' signaled. Indeed, official attitudes toward Jewish culture were ambivalent during this period. On the surface, Jewish culture seemed to be supported by the state: public efforts had been made to sustain the Yiddish theater after Mikhoels's death, Eynikayt was still publishing on schedule, and, most important, the Soviet Union recognized the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. To most Moscow Jews, the state of Soviet Jewry had never been better.Veidlinger, Jeffrey (2000). The Moscow State Yiddish Theater: Jewish Culture on the Soviet Stage. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press. p. 266. In November 1948, Soviet authorities launched a campaign to liquidate what was left of Jewish culture. The leading members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee were arrested. They were charged with treason, bourgeois nationalism and planning to set up a Jewish republic in Crimea to serve American interests. The Museum of Environmental Knowledge of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast (established in November 1944) and The Jewish Museum in Vilnius (established at the end of the war) were closed down in 1948.Pinkus, Benjamin (1990). The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 205. . The Historical- Ethnographic Museum of Georgian Jewry, established in 1933, was shut down at the end of 1951. In Birobidzhan, the various Jewish cultural institutions that had been established under Stalin's earlier policy of support for \\"proletarian Jewish culture\\" in the 1930s were closed down between late 1948 and early 1949. These included the Kaganovich Yiddish Theater, the Yiddish publishing house, the Yiddish newspaper Birobidzhan, the library of Yiddish and Hebrew books, and the local Jewish schools.Pinkus, Benjamin (1990). The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 193. . The same happened to Yiddish theaters all over the Soviet Union, beginning with the Odessa Yiddish Theater and including the Moscow State Jewish Theater. In early February 1949, the Stalin Prize-winning microbiologist Nikolay Gamaleya, a pioneer of bacteriology and member of the Academy of Sciences, wrote a personal letter to Stalin, protesting the growing antisemitism: \\"Judging by absolutely indisputable and obvious indications, the reappearance of antisemitism is not coming from below, not from the masses. . . but is directed from above, by someone's invisible hand. Antisemitism is coming from some high-placed persons who have taken up posts in the leading party organs. . .\\"Gamaleya, Nikolay. Letter to J. V. Stalin, Archive of the President of the Russian Federation. Quoted in Vaksberg, Arkady (2003). Iz ada v ray i obratno: yevreyskiy vopros po Leninu, Stalinu i Solzhenitsynu. Moscow: Olimp. pp. 344‚Äì346. . The ninety-year-old scientist wrote Stalin a second letter in mid-February, again mentioning the growing antisemitism. In March, Gamaleya died, still having received no answer.Vaksberg, Arkady (2003). Iz ada v ray i obratno: yevreyskiy vopros po Leninu, Stalinu i Solzhenitsynu. Moscow: Olimp. pp. 344‚Äì346. . During the night of 12‚Äì13 August 1952, remembered as the \\"Night of the Murdered Poets\\" (–ù–æ—á—å –∫–∞–∑–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–≤), thirteen of the most prominent Yiddish writers of the Soviet Union were executed on the orders of Stalin. Among the victims were Peretz Markish, David Bergelson and Itzik Fefer. In a 1 December 1952 Politburo session, Stalin announced: \\"Every Jewish nationalist is the agent of the American intelligence service. Jewish nationalists think that their nation was saved by the USA. . . They think they are indebted to the Americans. Among doctors, there are many Jewish nationalists.\\" Lindemann, Albert S. & Richard S. Levy (2010). Antisemitism: A History. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 187‚Äì188. . He also notably quoted Jean-Jacques Rosseau's \\"eat the rich\\" in this speech. A notable campaign to quietly remove Jews from positions of authority within the state security services was carried out in 1952‚Äì1953. The Russian historians Zhores and Roy Medvedev wrote that according to MVD General Sudoplatov, \\"simultaneously all Jews were removed from the leadership of the security services, even those in very senior positions. In February the anti-Jewish expulsions were extended to regional branches of the MGB. A secret directive was distributed to all regional directorates of the MGB on 22 February, ordering that all Jewish employees of the MGB be dismissed immediately, regardless of rank, age or service record. . . .Medvedev, Zhores A. & Roy A. Medvedev (2006). The Unknown Stalin. London: I. B. Tauris. p. 43. .\\". The outside world was not ignorant of these developments, and even the leading members of the Communist Party USA complained about the situation. In the memoir Being Red, the American writer and prominent Communist Howard Fast recalls a meeting with Soviet writer and World Peace Congress delegate Alexander Fadeyev during this time. Fadeyev insisted that \\"There is no anti- Semitism in the Soviet Union\\", despite the evidence \\"that at least eight leading Jewish figures in the Red Army and in government had been arrested on what appeared to be trumped-up charges. Yiddish-language newspapers had been suppressed. Schools that taught Hebrew had been closed. . . .\\"Fast, Howard (1994). Being Red: A Memoir. Armon, New York: M. E. Sharpe. pp. 217‚Äì218. . =The Doctors' Plot= There is a view, based on various memoirs and secondary evidence, that the doctors' plot case was intended to trigger mass repressions and deportations of the Jews, similar to deportations of many other ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union, but the plan was not accomplished because of the sudden death of Stalin. Zhores Medvedev writes that there are no documents found in support of the deportation planMedvedev, pp. 238‚Äì239, and Gennady Kostyrchenko writes the same. Nevertheless, the question remains open.Samson Madiyevsky,\\"1953 –≥–æ–¥: –ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–æ–Ø–ª–∞ –ª–∏ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏–º –µ–≤—Ä–µ–Ø–º –¥–µ–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–Ø?\\" According to Louis Rapoport, the genocide was planned to start with the public execution of the imprisoned doctors, and then the \\"following incidents would follow\\": \\"attacks on Jews orchestrated by the secret police, the publication of the statement by the prominent Jews, and a flood of other letters demanding that action be taken. A three-stage program of genocide would be followed. First, almost all Soviet Jews ... would be shipped to camps east of the Urals ... Second, the authorities would set Jewish leaders at all levels against one another ... Also the MGB [Secret Police] would start killing the elites in the camps, just as they had killed the Yiddish writers ... the previous year. The ... final stage would be to 'get rid of the rest.'\\" Four large camps were built in southern and western Siberia shortly before Stalin's death in 1953, and there were rumors that they were for Jews.Brent & Naumov 2003, p. 295. A special \\"Deportation Commission\\" to plan the deportation of Jews to these camps was allegedly created.Brent & Naumov 2003, pp. 47‚Äì48, 295.Eisenstadt, Yaakov, Stalin's Planned Genocide, 22 Adar 5762, March 6, 2002. Nikolay Poliakov, the secretary of the \\"Commission\\", stated years later that, according to Stalin's initial plan, the deportation was to begin in the middle of February 1953, but the monumental tasks of compiling lists of Jews had not yet been completed. \\"Pure blooded\\" Jews were to be deported first, followed by \\"half-breeds\\" (polukrovki). Before his death in March 1953, Stalin allegedly had planned the execution of Doctors' plot defendants already on trial in Red Square in March 1953, and then he would cast himself as the savior of Soviet Jews by sending them to camps away from the purportedly enraged Russian populace.Brent & Naumov 2003, pp. 298‚Äì300.Solzhenitzin, Alexander, The Gulag Archipelago, 1973. There are further statements that describe some aspects of such a planned deportation. Similar purges against Jews were organised in Eastern Bloc countries (see Prague Trials). During this time Soviet Jews were dubbed as persons of Jewish ethnicity. A dean of Marxism-Leninism department at one of Soviet Universities explained the policy to his students:Benedikt Sarnov,Our Soviet Newspeak: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism., Moscow: 2002, (–ù–∞—à —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –Ω–æ–≤–æ—è–∑. –ú–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è —Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏–∑–º–∞.), \\"Persons of Jewish ethnicity\\", pages 287‚Äì293. It has been said that: \\"At the time of [Stalin's] death, no Jew in Russia could feel safe.\\" However, throughout this time, the Soviet media avoided overt antisemitism and continued to report the punishment of officials for antisemitic behavior. Associates and family Joseph Stalin with Lazar Kaganovich. Some of Stalin's associates were Jews or had Jewish spouses, including Lazar Kaganovich. Many of them were purged, including Nikolai Yezhov's wife and Polina Zhemchuzhina, who was Vyacheslav Molotov's wife, and also Bronislava Poskrebysheva. Historian Geoffrey Roberts points out that Stalin \\"continued to f√™te Jewish writers and artists even at the height of the anti-Zionist campaign of the early 1950s.\\"Roberts, Geoffrey (2006). Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939‚Äì1953. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 341. . When Stalin's young daughter Svetlana fell in love with prominent Soviet filmmaker Alexei Kapler, a Jewish man twenty-three years her elder, Stalin was strongly irritated by the relationship. According to Svetlana, \\"He (Stalin) was irritated more than anything else by the fact that Kapler was Jewish\\".\\"–¢–æ, —á—Ç–æ –ö–∞–ø–ª–µ—Ä ‚Äì –µ–≤—Ä–µ–π, —Ä–∞–∑–¥—Ä–∞–∂–∞–ª–æ –µ–≥–æ, –∫–∞–∂–µ—Ç—Å—è, –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ.\\"N. Tolstoy, ibib., p. 24. Kapler was convicted to ten years of hard labor in Gulag on the charges of being an \\"English spy.\\" Stalin's daughter later fell in love with Grigori Morozov, another Jew, and married him. Stalin agreed to their marriage after much pleading on Svetlana's part, but refused to attend the wedding. Stalin's son Yakov also married a Jewish woman, Yulia Meltzer, and though Stalin disapproved at first, he began to grow fond of her. Stalin's biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore writes that Lavrenty Beria's son noted that his father could list Stalin's affairs with Jewish women.Sebag-Montefiore, Simon (2005). Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar. New York: Random House. p. 267. . Nikita Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that He further professed that Stalin frequently made antisemitic comments after World War II.Khrushchev, Nikita & Sergei Khrushchev (Ed.) (2006). Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev, Volume 2. University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 50. Analyzing various explanations for Stalin's perceived antisemitism in his book The Lesser Terror: Soviet State Security, 1939‚Äì1953, historian Michael Parrish posits that On the other hand, in Esau's Tears: Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews, historian Albert S.

Film Comment features reviews and analysis of mainstream, art-house, and avant-garde filmmaking from around the world.A. O. Scott (February 20, 2009). \\"Recovering Treasures From Below the Radar\\". The New York Times. Founded in 1962 and originally released as a quarterly, Film Comment began publishing on a bi- monthly basis with the Nov/Dec issue of 1972. In 2007, the magazine was awarded the Utne Independent Press Award for Best Arts Coverage.Winners of the 2007 Utne Independent Press Awards The magazine's editorial team also hosts the annual Film Comment Selects at the Film Society of Lincoln Center.  History  = Origins = Film Comment was founded during the boom years of the international art-house circuit and the so-called New American Cinema, an umbrella term for the era's independently produced documentaries and narrative features as well experimental and underground works. By way of a mission statement, founder publisher Joseph Blanco wrote in the inaugural issue: \\"With the increasing interest in the motion picture as an art form, and with the rise of the New American cinema, [Film Comment] takes its place as a publication for the independent film maker and those who share a sincere interest in the unlimited scope of the motion picture.\\"Joseph Blanco in Vision: A Journal of Film Comment (1:1, Spring 1962): page 2. = Gordon Hitchens, 1962‚Äì1970 = * The magazine's earliest publishers were Clara Hoover and Austin Lamont. By the third issue, the magazine had switched ownership to Lorien Productions, a corporation that Hoover \\"formed to cover investments in artistic enterprises\\" (35, Feb 1984). * Predisposition towards low-budget narrative features and cin√©ma v√©rit√©-style documentaries. Hitchens‚Äô dual rejection of Hollywood and the avant-garde (despite being acquainted with Jonas Mekas and Gregory Markopoulos and involved in New York's avant-garde scene). = Richard Corliss, 1970‚Äì1982 = * In sharp contrast to comparable film journals like Cahiers du cin√©ma and Sight & Sound, which were turning towards a more theoretically inflected and academic style of film criticism, corresponding to the contemporary vogue for Althusserian Marxism and Lacanian psychoanalysis, the writing in Film Comment remained relatively prosaic and broadly accessible. * Corliss' later work, particularly Talking Pictures [1974], mounted a persuasive critique of auteurism through critical emphasis on the creative contribution of screenwriters. He deeply admired Sarris' historical erudition and penetrating formalist insights, and he more generally shared the auteurists' strongly aesthetic sensibilities as well as their love for classical Hollywood cinema. * Under Corliss' guidance, Film Comment began in earnest an archeological excavation of Hollywood's past, focusing on classical-era directors like Frank Capra, John Ford, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, Max Oph√ºls, Nicholas Ray, and Orson Welles * In September‚ÄìOctober 1972, the magazine began publishing bimonthly instead of quarterly in order to generate more revenue. Eventually, Lamont had to find someone else to publish the magazine as it sank into a deficit. As a selection committee member on the New York Film Festival, Corliss sparked interest at the Film Society of Lincoln Center (which organizes the festival) in assuming the rights and assets of a publication that could offer it \\"year-round exposure for its activities\\" (Feb 1984, 44). * Publishing responsibilities were assumed by the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1972.} * Though the magazine changed ownership, Corliss stated that the Film Society had very little direct impact on its editorial content. He claimed that \\"a writer can make absolutely any opinion that he wants about anything, including Film Society of Lincoln Center policies or the New York Film Festival.\\" The magazine, however, did begin annual coverage of the New York Film Festival as \\"an obvious bow to the Society's interests\\" (Feb 1984, 46). = Harlan Jacobson, 1982‚Äì1990 = * The magazine continued to arrange every issue around a midsection that tackled multifaceted issues of film aesthetics, historiography, and various phenomena in film culture. It also maintained a strong commitment to exploring classical Hollywood, even as it broadened the international scope of its criticism with features on Iranian and \\"Far Eastern\\" cinema. * The magazine began to chronicle the technological changes that were shaping film spectatorship. It grappled with \\"The Video Revolution\\" in the early 1980s in a midsection devoted to the subject (May/June 1982). J. Hoberman wrote: \\"If Television gave every American home its own personal rep house, the VCR has the potential to equip every viewer with the equivalent of a Movieola or Steebeck. The appreciation thus engendered for fragmented (or fetishized) bits of 'Film' will likely have as profound an effect on the film culture of the Eighties as TV had on that of the Fifties and Sixties.\\" This phenomenon was further explored in David Chute's article \\"Zapper Power\\" (April 1984). * Music videos emerged as a point of interest. * In the February 1984 issue, Film Comment's midsection chronicled its own history from its beginnings as Vision to the financial and editorial challenges that lay before it in the ‚Äô80s. \\"Whatever its level of profitability‚Ä¶ Film Comment for the first time in its existence has finally been provided with a steady source of financing and a rock-solid publishing foundation. With Corliss as its editor, the society as its publisher, and a handful of quality writers as its key contributors, Film Comment now seems assured of continued survival and success.\\" * The midsection in April 1986 commented on the emergence of gay and lesbian representation in contemporary cinema, closeted homosexuals in Hollywood, and gay cinema in the decade of AIDS. = Richard Jameson, 1990‚Äì2000 = * A series of think-pieces on the state of film criticism (March/April, May/June, and July/August 1990) included Richard Corliss' article lamenting the shallowness of TV film reviewing, the star system, and Siskel & Ebert's thumbs-up/thumbs-down approach (\\"Movie criticism of the elevated sort, as practiced over the past half-century by James Agee and Manny Farber, Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael, J. Hoberman and Dave Kehr...is an endangered species\\"); a back-and-forth between Roger Ebert and Corliss; and an article by Andrew Sarris on auteurism, in which he cautions his younger colleagues on being overly despairing or flippantly humorous about the state of contemporary cinema. * The inclusion of a midsection on a specific topic in every issue was discontinued. * A new focus on assessing the careers of international auteurs (Chen Kaige, Ousmane Semb√®ne, Krzystof Kieslowski, Lars von Trier, Andr√© T√©chin√©, Abbas Kiarostami). The magazine also publishes several lengthy assessments of major contemporary filmmakers, including a two-part essay on Steven Spielberg spread across two issues (May/June and July/August 1992), and a sixty-page collection of articles on Martin Scorsese (May/June 1998). Other special sections on individual directors include a Robert Bresson symposium (May/June 1999) and, under the Gavin Smith editorship, a two-issue assessment of Chris Marker (May/June and July/August 2003). * The annual \\"Year in Review\\" feature was extended to include a \\"Moments Out of Time\\" section compiled by Jameson and contributing editor Kathleen Murphy, consisting of a long list of memorable scenes and images from the previous year. This feature, which was discontinued during Gavin Smith's editorship, has been reprised at MSN Movies. = Gavin Smith, 2000‚Äì2015 = * Renewed emphasis on contemporary relevance. * Punchier visual design. * Standardization of editorial format, and the addition of several departments:  Annual Reader's Poll (Jan/Feb 01);  Sound and Vision (Sep/Oct 01);  Site Specifics (May/Jun '07)  Encore (Originally, \\"Return Engagement\\" May/June 6); * Regular columns assigned to Alex Cox (\\"Flashback\\" then later \\"10,000 Ways to Die\\", May/June '06), Guy Maddin (\\"Guy Maddin's Jolly Corner\\"), Paul Arthur (\\"Art of the Real\\", May/June '06), and Olaf M√∂ller (\\"Olaf's World\\"); * One of the lengthiest and most controversial articles Film Comment has printed appeared in September/October 2006. \\"Canon Fodder\\", by Paul Schrader, asserted the value of and laid the parameters for a film canon, and criticized what it deemed \\"Nonjudgmentals\\", who had devised schemes by which art could be closely studied and analyzed without prejudice‚Äîthe prejudice, that is, of having to determine if the art work is good or bad vis- √†-vis another work of art‚Ä¶\\" * In 2004, New York Times film critic A. O. Scott described the magazine as, \\"a stronghold of feisty, intelligent opinion that pushes no particular party line. Its tone of plain-spoken braininess‚Äîsophistication without snobbery, erudition with a minimum of jargon‚Äîreflects the vitality and variety of international film culture today.\\"A. O.

From 1997 to 2006, he was General Secretary of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE). NATFHE merged with the Association of University Teachers (AUT) in 2006 to form the University and College Union, at which time Mackney was elected Joint general secretary (serving alongside Sally Hunt). He retired from union service in May 2007. He then worked part-time as an Associate Director of the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE) until May 2009 when he took ill-health retirement. Early life Mackney's father was a Landsburyite socialist evangelical vicar in the Church of England and his mother was a Christian Socialist. His parents deeply impressed the importance of racial equality and social justice on him as a child. Mackney attended Christ's Hospital boarding school. He trained briefly to become a probation officer, but ended up graduating with a bachelor's degree in politics from the University of Exeter.Beckett, \\"Going, But Not Gone,\\" The Guardian, 14 February 2006. During his time in college, he joined the International Socialists and became active in campaigns to strengthen the rights of the unemployed and those on public assistance. Later expelled from the International Socialists, he joined the Workers' League before becoming a member of the Labour Party.\\"Paul Mackney: A Child of the 1960s,\\" The Independent, 4 January 2004.Kingston, \\"Deal Maker Bows Out,\\" The Guardian, 23 May 2006. Mackney taught English in Hamburg, Germany, before returning England. He was a part- time lecturer in social studies at Poole Technical College in Poole, Dorset (where he joined ATTI which after merging with the ATCDE became NATFHE), before taking a full time position at Hall Green Technical College in Birmingham in 1975. From 1975 to 1992, Mackney taught about trade union issues in further education. Mackney received a master's degree in industrial relations from University of Warwick in 1986. His dissertation topic was the 1984‚Äì1985 miners' strike.Denham, \\"Learning from Solidarity: The Miners' Strike, 1984-5,\\" Solidarity, 27 May 2004. Union career Mackney was elected as the NATFHE representative to the Birmingham Trades Council in the late 1970s, eventually becoming Vice-President and President. He pushed for establishment of the Birmingham Trade Union Resource Centre, and from 1986 to 1992 was Head of the Birmingham Trade Union Studies Centre in Floodgate Street, Digbeth. Mackney was appointed a Regional Official for NATFHE in the West Midlands in 1992, and elected General Secretary of the union in 1997. Mackney discovered the union was nearly ¬£1 million in debt, the National Executive Committee was deeply splintered, the staff morale low, and the organisation drifting. He slashed costs and laid off staff, but also won the loyalty of the NEC and staff for his vision and leadership. He reinvigorated the 67,000-member trade union to such an extent that he was re-elected to an unprecedented second term in 2002. Mackney worked to improve the effectiveness and strength of NATFHE by seeking a merger of the trade union with the Association of University Teachers. Merger of the two unions occurred in 2006. Mackney was elected Joint general secretary along with AUT leader Sally Hunt. The new trade union represented about 120,000 academics and academic-related staff in further and higher education throughout the United Kingdom. Mackney suffered a severe heart attack in 2005. After an extensive recovery, he declined to run for the position of General Secretary of the UCU and retired from active union life. Mackney has been involved in larger trade union issues as well. In 1999, Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary John Monks appointed him to his first Task Group looking at the implications of the Stephen Lawrence report for trade unions. In September 2002, Mackney became the first NATFHE general secretary ever elected to the TUC General Council. Mackney became a founding member of a caucus on the TUC General Council known as \\"Fed Up With Losing.\\" The caucus, which included Billy Hayes, Jeremy Dear, Mick Rix, Mark Serwotka, and Bob Crow among others, argued for a much more aggressive and militant labour movement which would push the Labour Party in a more leftist direction and begin to challenge the lingering effects of Thatcherism. The media began calling the group the Awkward Squad.Murray, A New Labour Nightmare: The Return of the Awkward Squad, 2003; Buckley, \\"Blair Faces Clash With Union 'Awkward Squad',\\" The Times, 26 March 2003; Beckett, \\"Awkward? Us? Never!\\", The New Statesman, 8 September 2003. Political activity Mackney is a lifelong opponent of racism and fascism. He has been involved in anti-racism activities since his youth. As a trade union leader, he pushed for establishment of the Commission for Black Staff in Further Education and has attacked discrimination against staff and faculty as well as societal racism which prevents students from obtaining jobs upon graduation.Curtis, \\"FE Sector Branded 'Institutionally Racist',\\" The Guardian, 21 November 2002; Kingston, \\"Campaigners Speak Up for English Lessons,\\" The Guardian, 23 January 2007. Mackney has also vocally opposed the British National Party and other organised and unorganised forms of fascism in British society.\\"The Politics of Anti-Fascism,\\" Socialism Today, May 2004. The offices of the Unite Against Fascism Campaign, backed by over 20 trade unions, were located in the NATFHE building in Britannia Street, Kings Cross. He is also a strong supporter of Palestinian independence. However, in 2006, Mackney opposed a NATFHE resolution supporting a boycott of Israeli institutions of higher education.Garner, \\"Lecturers' Union Supports Boycott of 'Apartheid' Israel,\\" The Independent, 30 May 2006; Joffe-Walt, \\"Lecturers Back Boycott of Israeli Academics,\\" The Guardian, 30 May 2006. Mackney was also an early and strong opponent of the Iraq War. He has spoken out angrily about British involvement in the war, and condemned the government for its continued involvement in the continuing military occupation of Iraq.Vidal, \\"Soldiers' Parents Join 70,000 at Rally,\\" The Guardian, 18 October 2004; Hearst, \\"Anti- War Protest Deals Blow to Blair,\\" The Guardian, 27 September 2003. The offices of the Stop the War Campaign, which organised the biggest British demonstration in labour history, were located in the NATFHE building in Britannia Street, Kings Cross. In July 2015, Mackney endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. Notes References *Beckett, Francis. \\"Awkward? Us?

Historically in Nottinghamshire, since boundary changes in 1989, the priory and village has been in Lincolnshire. History The priory was founded before 1154. It was home to Premonstratensian canonesses and was one of only two female priories of that order in England (the other being Orford Priory). When it was founded, however, it was initially home to both canons and canonesses. The priory was dedicated to God and St Mary, and its mother-house was Newsham Abbey in Lincolnshire. House of Premonstratensian canonesses: The priory of Broadholme, A History of the County of Nottingham: Volume 2 (1910), pp. 138-140. Date accessed: 28 July 2013 Pope Nicholas IV's taxation roll records the priory as having an income of ¬£4 13s. The priory was also in control of the church at Thorney, Nottinghamshire, which provided an extra ¬£8 annual income. The priory was given a charter of confirmation by King Edward II in 1318. The charter reveals several of the priory's benefactors, including donations by: *Ralph D'Aubeney ‚Äì an orchard adjacent to the cemetery of St Botolph's church, Saxilby *Hugh de Basset ‚Äì \\"rents\\" in Newark, Nottinghamshire and two quarters of corn *Peter de Campania ‚Äì land at Stow, Lincolnshire *Richard de Claypole ‚Äì land in North Collingham *Walter and Agnes de Clifford ‚Äì Thorney church, land and a mill; *Geoffrey de Crosby ‚Äì land in Ingleby *Walter Faber ‚Äì land at Torksey *Peter and Agnes Goushill (and their children)‚Äì large amounts of land and several tenements in Saxilby *Simon de Hale ‚Äì land at Little Hale *Ralph de Muscamp and Isabel (daughter of de Collingham) ‚Äì \\"rents\\" in Collingham *William Newbrid ‚Äì \\"rents\\" in Broadholme *Baldwin Wake ‚Äì \\"rents\\" in Skellingthorpe *William Wynok ‚Äì a \\"toft\\" in Fillingham *Aubrea and Ivo (\\"children of Ralph, son of Lambert\\") ‚Äì \\"lands and rents in the parish of Sir Edward Wigford\\" (Lincoln) Queen Isabel (consort of King Edward II) was a patroness of the canonesses and is known \\"for the special affection which she bore to them\\". In 1327 she donated the annual sum of 8 marks to the priory from her lands at Great Massingham in Norfolk. In 1329 the Sheriff of Norfolk was given responsibility for ensuring the canonesses received their payment. In October 1327 Isabel arranged the transfer of the mortmain of certain lands to the priory, valued as worth ¬£10 per year. In 1478 the priory was visited, and it was recorded that all of the canonesses could read and sing. In 1494 the priory was recorded as home to the prioress and eight canonesses: *Dame Elizabeth Brerworth (priorissa) *Johanna Stertone (suppriorissa) *Dame Elizabeth Formane *Agnes Aschby *Johanna Newsome *Margery Robynsone *Johanna Roos *Johanna Steyntone *Johanna Uptone The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1534 records the gross annual value of this small priory as ¬£18 11s. 10d. The priory was dissolved in 1536. On 12 December 1536 the last prioress, Joan Aungewen (or Angevin), was assigned a pension of 7 marks. The site was granted by the Crown to Ralph Jackson in 1537. =Remains= The remains of the monastic buildings are thought to have been incorporated into Manor Farm, which was built on the site; there are, however, no visible architectural remains. The priory chapel was located at the back of the current house and the cemetery was to the east in an area occupied by an orchard. The priory's former fishponds were filled in during the 1960s.

It includes some species that are notorious defoliating pests. The subfamily was first described by Philog√®ne Auguste Joseph Duponchel in 1845. The status of several tribes is debated. For example, the Boarmiini are sometimes massively expanded to include the Bistonini, Bupalini, Erannini, Gnophini, Melanolophini, Phaseliini and Theriini. The Nacophorini and perhaps the Campaeini might need to be merged with the Lithinini, and all three might warrant merging into the Ennomini. The group sometimes separated as Cassymini is tentatively included in the Abraxini here.

Hostels The junior section of the school, which hived off as Kimberley Boys' Junior School in 1970, subsequently simply Kimberley Junior School, was served by a hostel known as Dugmore House. Leslie Moult who was hostel superintendent was also first headmaster of Kimberley Boys' Junior School. The senior hostel was Francis Oats House. Boys attending Boys' High were also housed at Bishop's Hostel, an institution owned by the Anglican Church until 1981 when it was transferred to Boys' High. Sport Sport has an integral role in the life of KHS where every learner is encouraged to take part in at least one summer and one winter sport. At least sixteen KHS alumni have gone on to represent South Africa in international sport.Kimberley Boys‚Äô High School ‚Äì Sports portfolio Alumni who have achieved Springbok status in various sporting codes are listed below.

It is located in the Town of Schroeppel. Its ZIP Code is 13132. Elevation is 413 feet above Mean Sea Level. History The hamlet is named after Richard Pennell M.D., of New York. His wife inherited the land from her father, George C. Schroeppel. Running through the area was a stream, called by the local Indian tribe Ahinahtanaganus (translated: \\"big fish water\\") upon which, in 1833, Dr. Pennell commissioned a sawmill, which was built by Laren Seymour. In the 1820s up to the 1850s, Plains Indians migrated from the western United States and occupied most of what is now Pennellville.http://www.americanindiancoc.org/native-american-tribes-the- indian-history-in-pennellville-new-york/ In an 1878 study, the predominantly all-white hamlet was located on the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad, and contained a general store (now the Wegmans in Liverpool), the Kraft Singles cheese-factory but is now a bar and grill in Williamstown, the saw-mill, a brick-yard, a blacksmithy, a railroad depot, telegraph and express offices, a hotel called the Riverside Inn in Fulton, a Universalist church in Central Square called First Universalist Church (Rochester, New York), and a brick school-house. The population at that time was estimated to be around 150. The only schools are Little Utica United Methodist Church and Phoenix Central School District. There is a concert music venue called Moniraes that brings in touring national acts. The burial ground in the hamlet is the burial place of Dr. and Mrs. Pennell, and also Henry W. Schroeppel.

Set in Londinium, Britannia in August AD 75, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The title refers to the use of Jupiter-related mythology by the crime syndicate to identify businesses associated with them. The novel is notable for the introduction of Albia, the young British orphan who becomes Falco's adoptive daughter and is the protagonist of a second novel series by Davis, beginning with The Ides of April. Plot summary Despite having put the project of building the palace for the king of the Atrebates, Togidubnus, back on track, there is no peace for Falco and his family (his wife, his children, his brothers in law and his sister Maia Favonia) in Londinium as Togidubnus' disgraced friend, Verovolcus (see A Body in the Bath House), is found drowned in the well of a seedy Londinium taverna named the Shower of Gold, stripped of his torque. Fearful of the diplomatic consequences, the local authorities in the form of Gaius Hilaris (see The Silver Pigs), Falco's old friend and Helena's uncle, urge Falco to take up inquiries into the death. At the same time, Maia's children and Lucius Petronius \\"Petro'\\" Longus, Falco's best friend, have appeared in Londinium. Things become more tense with Togidubnus breathing down Falco and Hilarius' necks for answers on who killed Verovolcus, and a newly arrived businessman, Norbanus Murena, hitting on Maia. Falco and Helena discover extortion rackets terrorising Londinium when a fire breaks out at a bakery. He muses on how suspicious the fire at the bakery is, since there was nobody in the bakery during the conflagration, and suspects that it was arson by whoever is behind the rackets. In the midst of the blaze, a vagrant girl risks her life to save a pack of dogs. Touched by this show of heroism, Helena adopts the girl, who is named Albia. The relationship between the Didii and Albia goes off on a rocky start, however, with Albia vandalising Hilarius' home. Simultaneously Petro' also disappears, and at a very bad time too  a message soon arrives, saying that two of Petro's children have died in Rome. Falco is forced to take Albia out along with him, and decides to look for Petro', but Petro' warns him to stay away because he is going undercover and then flees. Worse, Albia is abducted and forced into a brothel. Falco goes to her rescue and is assisted by an unlikely ally: a group of female gladiators (or gladiatrices) led by an ex-girlfriend of Falco's named Chloris, now going by the stage name of Amazonia. The gladiatrices believe Falco to be responsible for Albia's plight and detain him, but Helena (who was summoned by Albia) convinces them to release Falco. The reunion with Chloris temporarily strains Falco's marriage with Helena, but eventually they reconcile. Enquiries, however, begin to pay off and soon enough, with Chloris' help Falco manages to identify the rackets' enforcers in town, nicknamed Pyro and Splice. Falco and his associates soon notice something else  many of the businesses in town all have names derived from myths surrounding Jupiter, the chief god of the Roman pantheon. Chloris also reveals to Falco that she saw Pyro and Splice up-end Verovolcus into the well, and that whoever is employing them is also harassing her and her gladiatrix group into working for him. A corpse is found on the wharves and sure enough, it is the missing baker whose shop was torched. Petro contacts Falco and reveals he is on an undercover mission for the vigiles in Rome, tracking whoever is behind the Londinium rackets, and happened to witness the baker's murder (but unfortunately can't identify the perpetrators). After a brief discussion, they decide to arrest Pyro and Splice. As usual, things don't go down well  a lawyer named Popilius attempts to free the enforcers but fails. Pyro is poisoned and Splice manages to escape from custody before any of them can be interrogated by the chief torturer, ironically named Amicus (Latin: 'friend'). Meanwhile, king Togidubnus has managed to detain one of the employees of the Shower of Gold, a Briton named Flavia Fronta, who reveals the head of the rackets in Londinium and it's none other than Florius, the son of the late gangster Balbinus Pius (see Time to Depart). Amicus' interrogations later confirm that Florius is in Britain, at the head of the racket which is named the Jupiter Company (hence all the businesses in Londinium with names connected to Jupiter) and that he is out to get Petro' too. Albia reveals to Falco and Helena that Florius was the man who abducted her earlier, and he had even raped her before Chloris rescued her. Falco now hopes to apprehend Florius for murdering Verovolcus, but unfortunately for him and Petro', it's Florius who makes the first move by attacking Chloris, with the intent of wiping her out. A confused battle soon takes place at the local arena, with Falco and his entourage coming in to help Chloris and her comrades, and Splice coming in to take revenge on Florius. Chloris kills Splice, but is slain by Florius who subsequently escapes. A chance meeting with Popilius soon reveals a terrible truth: Norbanus, the businessman courting Falco's sister Maia, is also head of the Jupiter Company. To make matters worse, both Norbanus and Maia have disappeared and Florius sends Falco a message: Petro' must be handed over in order to secure Maia's release. Petro' willingly sacrifices himself and goes over to Florius, but Florius reneges on the bargain. Another battle takes place  this time between the Governor's legions and Florius' gangsters, who are holed up in a public building. Petro' is rescued from being crushed to death, and Falco captures Norbanus, but Florius manages to escape again. At the same time, Maia also appears  she had actually been stranded with her children while on a river cruise. Maia personally kills Norbanus with a crossbow when he tries to flee. Notwithstanding the end of the Jupiter Company, however, the case against Florius crumbles: the murderer of Verovolcus is revealed to be Flavia Fronta, the waitress at the Shower of Gold: she had stolen Verovolcus' torque and drowned him to prevent him from reporting her theft of his torque, now recovered from the tavern. While this would satisfactorily resolve the diplomatic crisis with the Atrebates, it however now means that Petro's nemesis, Florius, cannot be indicted and is still at large. Cheated of success, Falco and Petro' swear that they will have their revenge on Florius.

Neusoft has subsidiaries in United States (Livonia, Michigan, Santa Clara, California, Morrisville, North Carolina), Japan (Tokyo), Switzerland (Appenzell), Germany (Hamburg, Munich) and Romania (Cluj-Napoca). History Neusoft Group's Headquarters in Shenyang, China Neusoft was founded by Northeastern University professors Liu Jiren and Li Huatian in 1988 as the Computer Software and Network Engineering Research Laboratory of Northeastern University. It had an initial allocation of three people, three computers, and capital of RMB 30,000. In 1990 it became the NEU Computer Software Research and Development Centre. It was incorporated in 1991. They had a collaboration with Alpine Electronics of Japan and the venture was called Neu-Alpine Software Research Institute. Through technical export and software outsourcing, this made Alpine their first international customer. The entity then became the Neu-Alpine Software Co. Ltd in 1993. As CEO, Liu Jiren led the company in these developments. The first stages of construction of Neusoft Park began in 1995; around the same time, Neusoft incorporated the NEU Computer Imaging Centre and began to investigate CT scanning and related medical technologies. The NEU Software Group Ltd. was founded in 1996; one of its early collaborations was with Toshiba. In 1996, Neusoft became the first listed software company in China, with an offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A partnership with Bao Steel in 1998 broadened the firm's investor base.

Known for most of its length as Ridge Road, the highway runs from MD 355 in Germantown north to MD 30 in Manchester. MD 27 follows a ridge that separates several watersheds in northern Montgomery County and Carroll County. The highway connects Germantown and Manchester with Damascus in far northern Montgomery County; Westminster, the county seat of Carroll County; and Mount Airy, which lies at the junction of Carroll, Frederick, Howard, and Montgomery counties and where MD 27 intersects Interstate 70 (I-70)/U.S. Route 40 (US 40). MD 27 follows what were originally MD 29 and part of MD 31. The highway received its present number south of Westminster in a swap with US 29 in 1934 and north of Westminster in 1967. Ridge Road south of Mount Airy and Manchester Road between Westminster and Manchester were constructed as one of the original state roads in the early to mid-1910s. The Mount Airy-Westminster portion of MD 27 was built in the 1920s. MD 27 was reconstructed in the early to mid-1950s from Germantown to Westminster. MD 31 was reconstructed north of Westminster in the late 1950s; old segments of the highway became part of MD 852. MD 27 bypassed Mount Airy in the 1970s, leaving behind MD 808. The highway was relocated at its southern end in the mid-1990s to improve access between Damascus and Germantown and I-270. Route description MD 27 runs on top of or in the vicinity of a long ridge known for most of its length as Parr's Ridge. This ridge separates several sets of watersheds in central Maryland, with the result that MD 27 bridges no significant streams. From Germantown to south of Damascus, the ridge separates the waters of Little Seneca Creek to the west and Great Seneca Creek to the east; these creeks come together at Dawsonville and flow into the Potomac River. From Damascus north, all streams west of the ridge flow into the Monocacy River, including Bennett Creek, Bush Creek, and Little and Big Pipe Creek from south to north. All east-side streams flow into the Patuxent River from Damascus to south of Mount Airy, the South Branch of the Patapsco River from Mount Airy to Taylorsville, and the Patapsco River North Branch from Taylorsville to Manchester. MD 27 is part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial in five sections: from MD 355 in Germantown to Gue Road in Damascus; from Penn Shop Road south of Mount Airy to the Frederick-Carroll county line; from I-70 to the northern town limit of Mount Airy; from Chapel Road south of Westminster to Old Manchester Road in Mexico; and from the southern town limit of Manchester to MD 30. =Germantown to Mount Airy= MD 27 northbound past southern terminus at MD 355 in Germantown MD 27 begins as Ridge Road at an intersection with MD 355 (Frederick Road) on the northern edge of Germantown. Ridge Road continues west as a six-lane divided county highway to a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway), beyond which the county highway continues as Father Hurley Boulevard, one of the primary arteries of Germantown. MD 27 curves north through a directional intersection with Henderson Corner Road and reduces from a six-lane divided highway to a two- lane undivided road past its intersection with Brink Road. The highway passes through the hamlet of Cedar Grove on its way to Damascus. At Damascus High School, MD 27 gains a center left-turn lane, a second lane northbound, then becomes a four-lane undivided highway. The highway becomes two lanes again at the west end of downtown Damascus, curves east, then turns north to remain on Ridge Road. The road continues straight east as MD 108 (Main Street), which leads to MD 124 (Woodfield Road). MD 27 starts out of Damascus as a four-lane undivided highway but quickly drops to two lanes. At the north end of the unincorporated town, the state highway meets the northern end of county- maintained Woodfield Road. MD 27 meets the eastern end of MD 80 (Kemptown Road) in the hamlet of Claggettsville. The highway crosses the Patuxent River just south of its source and passes through the western edge of Howard County. Between a pair of intersections with Penn Shop Road, MD 27 crosses a sliver of Montgomery County before entering Frederick County and expanding to a four- lane divided highway. The highway meets the west end of the Mount Airy- Ellicott City segment of MD 144 (Old National Pike). The intersection is just west of Parrs Spring, the source of the South Branch of the Patapsco River. Parrs Spring contains the quadripoint where the boundaries of Montgomery, Howard, Frederick, and Carroll counties meet. =Mount Airy to Manchester= View south at the north end of MD 27 at MD 30 in Manchester North of MD 144, MD 27 briefly follows the Frederick-Carroll county line before fully entering Carroll County and the town of Mount Airy at its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-70/US 40 (Baltimore National Pike). The west leg of MD 27's intersection with the ramp from westbound I-70/US 40 meets the southern end of Main Street, which becomes MD 808 north of Ridgeville Boulevard. The MD 27-Main Street intersection is directly above the tunnel CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision uses to passes through Parrs Ridge. The state highway becomes undivided north of Ridgeville Boulevard; the highway passes a longitudinal park and ride facility before intersecting Park Avenue and Twin Arch Road, where the route drops to two lanes. MD 27 leaves and re-enters Mount Airy a few times before leaving for good south of its intersection with MD 808 (Main Street) in the hamlet of Dorceytown. MD 27 continues north along the top of Parrs Ridge. The highway intersects MD 26 (Liberty Road) at Taylorsville and meets the eastern end of MD 407 (Marston Road) north of there. MD 27 crosses Morgan Run south of the hamlet of Warfieldsburg and crosses the Maryland Midland Railway and Little Pipe Creek at Spring Mills. The state highway enters a dense residential neighborhood just north of its junction with Bond Street but does not enter the city of Westminster and the Westminster Historic District until George Street. MD 27 follows Liberty Street for three blocks to Main Street; at that intersection, the state highway and Main Street intersect the Maryland Midland Railway and MD 27 becomes Railroad Avenue. The route parallels the railroad through an industrial area and has a center turn lane until its four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 97 and MD 140 (Baltimore Boulevard). MD 27 heads northeast out of the city of Westminster and becomes Manchester Road. The highway crosses the Maryland Midland Railway and the West Branch of the North Branch of the Patapsco River ahead of its intersection with unsigned MD 852G (Old Manchester Road). MD 27 crosses Cranberry Branch before reaching Mexico, where the highway meets the western end of MD 482 (Hampstead Mexico Road) and the northern end of MD 852G (Old Manchester Road). The highway is paralleled by several segments of Old Manchester Road, most of them segments of MD 852. MD 27 intersects a non-state segment of old road, Westminster Street, shortly before the route enters the town of Manchester and passes south of a park and ride lot before reaching its northern terminus at MD 30 (Hanover Pike), the town's main street. History Ridge Road was designated MD 29 and Manchester Road was marked as MD 31 when the Maryland State Roads Commission first assigned numbers to state roads in 1927. MD 29 became MD 27 in a number swap with the original MD 27, which ran from Silver Spring to Ellicott City, when the latter highway became part of US 29 in 1934. MD 27 was extended north along Manchester Road in place of MD 31, which was truncated at Westminster, in 1967. =Original construction= MD 27 northbound past Woodfield Road north of Damascus Ridge Road from Germantown to Mount Airy and Manchester Road from Westminster to Manchester were included in the original state road system drawn up by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The segment of the highway from the National Pike (now Ridgeville Boulevard) at Ridgeville to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision) in the center of Mount Airy was paved by 1910. In 1911, Ridge Road was built as a macadam road from the National Pike south to the Patuxent River. That same year, construction began from Henderson's Corner at Frederick Road north of Germantown to Davis Mill Road near Cedar Grove. That segment was completed as a macadam road in 1912. That portion of Ridge Road was extended to near Kings Valley in 1914. The gap from south of Damascus to the Patuxent River was completed as a concrete road from the Patuxent River to Claggettsville in 1913 and through Damascus in 1915. Manchester Road was completed as a macadam road from the Westminster city limit north to Cranberry Station on the Western Maryland Railway (now Maryland Midland Railway) in 1911. The road was extended to just south of Mexico in 1913; in addition, construction on the state road began from the town limit of Manchester. The gap between Mexico and south of Manchester was filled in 1914. The northernmost part of the highway, a concrete road along Westminster Street in the town of Manchester, was completed by 1921. Work on Ridge Road between Mount Airy and Westminster began with the construction of a concrete road from the existing macadam road in Mount Airy north to Dorceytown between 1918 and 1920. The concrete road was started from the Westminster end and reached a point north of Warfieldsburg by 1923. The modern highway was extended south through Warfieldsburg and north from Dorceytown to north of Gillis Falls Road by 1927. The northern segment was extended south to Morgan Run and the southern segment north to Gillis Road in 1928. Ridge Road was completed from Mount Airy to Westminster when the gap through Taylorsville was filled in 1929. The Germantown-Mount Airy portion of Ridge Road once served as the primary highway between Frederick and Rockville, but was eclipsed by the highway through Hyattstown and Urbana when that highway, designated US 240 (now MD 355), was completed in 1926. =Modernization and improvements= MD 27 northbound past the Patuxent River in Howard County In 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended MD 27 from Henderson's Corner to Ridgeville and MD 31 from Westminster to Manchester be widened to . MD 27 was widened with the addition of a pair of and resurfaced from Damascus to Ridgeville and from Mount Airy to north of Dorceytown in 1938. Extensive work on the highway from Germantown to Damascus started with the stretch from Damascus to the Patuxent River, which was widened from and resurfaced between 1948 and 1950. MD 27 was widened to and resurfaced from near Parrs Spring to the center of Mount Airy between 1950 and 1952. The highway between Cedar Grove and Damascus was widened and resurfaced in 1953 and 1954; this work included a major relocation that replaced a curvaceous segment on what is now Oak Drive. Modernization of MD 27 between Germantown and Mount Airy concluded when the portion between US 240 and Cedar Grove was widened and resurfaced between 1954 and 1956. MD 27 and MD 31 were widened and resurfaced through Westminster starting in 1952. MD 27 was widened and resurfaced from Westminster to south of Warfieldsburg between 1950 and 1954; this work included a relocation at Spring Mills. Work on the highway from south of Warfieldsburg to Taylorsville and there to Mount Airy; both widening and resurfacing projects got underway in 1954 and were completed in 1956. Construction began on reconstructing and widening MD 31 from Manchester to Westminster in 1957. This project involved several relocations of the highway, including moving Manchester Road to its present terminus at MD 30, by the time it was completed in 1960. Sections of old road became segments of MD 852, including MD 852G between Westminster and Mexico. MD 27's original interchange with I-70 was constructed when US 40 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway through Ridgeville in 1953 and 1954. This interchange was a four-ramp partial cloverleaf along the line of Mount Airy's Main Street directly on the Carroll-Frederick county line. MD 27's bypass of Mount Airy was constructed from Dorceytown south to Ridgeville Boulevard in 1972. MD 27's I-70 interchange was reconstructed to its present six-ramp partial cloverleaf design slightly to the east of the old interchange as part of I-70's upgrade to Interstate standards in 1975. MD 27's bypass of Mount Airy was completed from Ridgeville Boulevard south to the I-70 interchange in 1977; MD 808 was marked on Main Street by 1978. MD 27 was relocated at its southern end as a divided highway from MD 355 to Brink Road between 1993 and 1996. This work was part of a state-county project to connect Ridge Road and Father Hurley Boulevard with I-270 to improve access between I-270, Germantown, and Damascus. The old segment of MD 27 became Henderson Corner Road.

He has studied and written about terrorism, violence and religion, and has done fieldwork with terrorists and Islamic fundamentalists, as well as political leaders. Early life and education Atran was born in New York City in 1952. While a student, he became assistant to anthropologist Margaret Mead at the American Museum of Natural History. He received his BA from Columbia College, MA from Johns Hopkins University, and PhD in anthropology from Columbia University. Career Atran has taught at Cambridge University, Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes and √âcole polytechnique in Paris, and John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. He is emeritus research director in anthropology at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and member of the Jean Nicod Institute at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. He is also research professor of public policy and psychology at the University of Michigan, founding fellow of the Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict at Oxford University, and cofounder of ARTIS International. =Early years= In 1974 he originated a debate at the Royaumont Abbey in France on the nature of universals in human thought and society. Other participants included linguist Noam Chomsky, psychologist Jean Piaget, anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Claude L√©vi-Strauss, and biologists Fran√ßois Jacob and Jacques Monod, which Harvard's Howard Gardner and others consider a milestone in the development of cognitive science. =Research= Atran has experimented on the ways scientists and ordinary people categorize and reason about nature, on the cognitive and evolutionary psychology of religion, and on the limits of rationality in understanding and managing deep-seated cultural and political conflict. His work has been widely published internationally in the popular press, and in scientific journals in a variety of disciplines. He has briefed members of the US Congress and the National Security Council staff with documents and presentations including \\"The Devoted Actor versus the Rational Actor in World Conflict\\", \\"Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of Global Network Terrorism\\" and \\"Pathways to and from Violent Extremism\\". He was an early critic of U.S. intervention in Iraq and of deepening involvement in Afghanistan. In April 2015, he addressed the United Nations Security Council on \\"Youth, Peace, and Security.\\" Atran has also been a staunch opponent of political attempts to eliminate government funding for social science, arguing that it is critical to the national interest, including innovation and security in business, technology, medicine and defense. On conflict negotiation Atran has published research on the limits of rational choice in political and cultural conflict. He has collaborated on research on how political negotiations could be made more likely to produce agreement. Atran and the psychologists Jeremy Ginges and Douglas Medin and political scientist Khalil Shikaki conducted an experiment that surveyed \\"600 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, more than 500 Palestinian refugees, and more than 700 Palestinian students, half of whom identified with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\\" The researchers divided the subjects into three groups, each of which was presented with a different \\"hypothetical peace deal.\\" In the basic situation, those surveyed were presented with \\"a two-state solution in which the Israelis would withdraw from 99 percent of the West Bank and Gaza but would not have to absorb Palestinian refugees\\"; the proposal \\"did not go over well.\\" For the second group, the hypothetical deal \\"was sweetened with cash compensation from the United States and the European Union, such as a billion dollars a year for a hundred years, or a guarantee that the people would live in peace and prosperity. With these sweeteners on the table, the nonabsolutists, as expected, softened their opposition a bit. But the absolutists, forced to contemplate a taboo tradeoff, were even more disgusted, angry, and prepared to resort to violence.\\" But for the third group, the proposed two-state solution was \\"augmented with a purely symbolic declaration by the enemy in which it compromised on one of its sacred values.\\" In the deal presented to Israeli settlers, the Palestinians \\"would give up any claims to their right of return\\" or \\"would be required to recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel\\"; in that presented to the Palestinians, Israel \\"would recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Palestinians to their own state and would apologize for all wrongs done to the Palestinian people,\\" or would \\"give up what they believe is their sacred right to the West Bank\\" or would \\"symbolically recognize the historic legitimacy of the right of return [without in fact granting it]\\". In summarizing the result, cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker claims, \\"Unlike the bribes of money or peace, the symbolic concession of a sacred value by the enemy, especially when it acknowledges a sacred value on one's own side, reduced the absolutists' anger, disgust, and willingness to endorse violence.\\" In a study of Middle East leaders published in Science (journal), Atran interviewed leaders, as distinct from popular views. In the earlier responses, people rejected material concessions without symbolic concessions, but were open to negotiations that started with symbolic concessions. Leaders responded the same way, except that they saw the symbolic concession as only an introduction to significant material concessions as well. For example, when the researchers asked Musa Abu Marzouk, deputy chairman of Hamas, about a trade-off for peace without granting a right of return, he said ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù When he was offered a trade-off with a substantial material incentive, he said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù even more emphatically; ‚Äúwe do not sell ourselves for any amount.‚Äù But when he was offered an apology, he said ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù although an apology would only be a beginning. ‚ÄúOur houses and land were taken away from us and something has to be done about that.‚Äù Similarly, when the researchers asked Binyamin Netanyahu (then opposition leader), ‚ÄúWould you seriously consider accepting a two-state solution following the 1967 borders if all major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, were to recognize the right of the Jewish people to an independent state in the region?‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúYes, but the Palestinians would have to show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations and then allow some border adjustments so that Ben Gurion [Airport] would be out of range of shoulder-fired missiles.‚Äù Atran has worked with the United Nations Security Council and has been engaged in conflict negotiations in the Middle East Field research on terrorism His work on the ideology and social evolution of transnational terrorism, which has included fieldwork with mujahedin and supporters in Europe, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, and North Africa, has challenged common assumptions. Cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker summarizes some of Atran's findings thus: Atran has summarized his work and conclusions: Regarding Atran's analysis of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as a revolutionary movement of \\"world-historic proportions,\\" a writer for The New York Times considers Atran: The Chronicle of Higher Education accompanied Atran to frontlines in the battle against ISIS in Iraq, where he and his research team were assessing \\"will to fight\\" among the combatants: A series of experimental studies directed by Atran and social psychologist √Ångel G√≥mez performed with captured ISIS fighters, fighters of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Peshmerga, Iraq Army and Arab Sunni Militia in Iraq, as well as with thousands of ordinary European citizens, have further elaborated the Devoted Actor framework in an effort to ‚Äúhelp to inform policy decisions for the common defense.‚Äù According to reporting from CNN: Atran argues in an interview in The Washington Post that: \\"Never in history have so few people with so few means caused so much fear.\\" He and his research colleagues at ARTIS International contend that: Atran and colleagues propose an alternative approach, driven by theoretically-framed field research that ground-truths big data and informs policy-making while maintaining intellectual independence. In 2017, Atran co-authored a groundbreaking paper with Angel Gomez, Lucia Lopez-Rodriguez, Hammad Sheikh, Jeremy Ginges, Lydia Wilson, Hoshang Waziri, Alexandra Vazquez, and Richard Davis. Titled 'The Devoted Actor's Will to Fight and the Spiritual Dimension of Human Conflict', the piece focuses on the spiritual dimensions of conflict based upon field work in Iraq with combatants and lab studies, assessing non-utilitarian dimensions of conflict. Atran and his team have validated aspects of these behavioral findings in recent neuroimaging studies of radicalized individuals in Europe, including greater willingness to fight and die for sacred versus non-sacred values that involves inhibition of deliberative reasoning in favor of rapid, duty-bound responses. =Other work= Atran conducts ongoing research in Guatemala, Mexico, and the U.S. on universal and culture-specific aspects of biological categorization and environmental reasoning and decision making among Maya and other Native Americans. His research team has focused on immigration of Spanish-speaking Ladinos and highland Q'eqchi' people of Guatemala into the northern lowland Pet√©n region, and their interaction with the lowland Itza whose language is near extinction but whose agro-forestry practices, including use of dietary and medicinal plants, may still tell us much about pre-colonial management of the Maya lowlands.Atran, Scott; Lois, Ximena; Ucan Ek', Edilberto (2004) Plants of the Peten Itza Maya, Memoirs of the Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, 38 Atran found that the Itza' rejected majority-culture offers for exploiting natural resources as violating spiritual injunctions that may represent the summary wisdom of centuries of experience; however, later follow-up studies suggest that this wisdom, and the sustainable practices it encouraged, are vanishing as the last Itza speakers die out. Atran's debates with Sam Harris, Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins and others during the 2006 Beyond Belief symposium on the limits of reason and the role of religion in modern society highlight the differences between these authors, who see religion as fundamentally false beliefs associated with primitive cosmology, as well as politically and socially repressive, and Atran who sees unfalsifiable but semantically absurd religious beliefs and binding ritual obligations as historically critical to the formation and social cohesion of large-scale societies and current motivators for both conflict and cooperation.

Today the ruins are protected as official historical monuments of France ().  History  The castle dominates the rocky headland and the ravine of Vernassonne, at an important strategic position at the entry of the Montagne noire. Based on historical texts, it can be dated to at least 960. It was bequeathed by the bishop of Toulouse to the Count of Carcassonne. In the 11th century, the castle was pledged to powerful vassals in the country. They formed a junior branch under the counts of Foix who formed at the time the lineage of Saissac. It is important all the same to note the presence of a castrum under the current caste, probably dating from the 11th century, though its origin can date to the time of the Visigoths. At the time of the Albigensian Crusade in 1229, the lord of Saissac, Bertrand de Saissac, himself a Cathar, was the tutor of Raymond Roger de Trencavel. They were subjugated and stripped of their titles. Bouchard de Marly ordered the seizing of the castle and its goods; it was only later, after 1234, that the castle was restored by Lambert de Thursey, another companion of Montfort. At the end of the 13th century, the castle became the inheritance of the family of L√©vis, new lords of Mirepoix. From 1331 to 1412, it passed to the family of Isle- Jourdain. In the 15th century, the barony was held by the family of Caraman. The castle changed hands repeatedly until 1565, passing through the hands of Bernuy, a rich man, and house of Clermont-Lod√®ve. In 1568 and 1580, the Protestant troops destroyed the village but were unable to enter the impregnable fortress. From 1715, the castle was held by the Luynes, who however did not reside in the castle. After the French Revolution, the castle quickly fell in ruins, after repeatedly being looted by treasure hunters in 1862 lured by the castle's romantic aspect.  Today  The Ch√¢teau de Saissac from the entrance From 1995, the castle has been in the possession of the commune, which began a programme of restoration in order to make the castle available to visitors. In 2007, two rooms of the main building (the Aldonce residence, constructed in the 16th century) were been rebuilt in the 16th century style, together with the framework resembling the hull of a ship. Many locked cellars under the keep have been made accessible.

He played Major League Baseball pitcher for the Cleveland Spiders in 1897 and the Chicago Orphans in 1898. He was also a coach for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. He later served as a Nebraska state legislator and railroad commissioner. Early years Clarke was born in August 1875 at Bellevue, Nebraska. His father, Henry T. Clarke, Sr., was a well-known merchant who served in the Nebraska territorial legislature. Clarke was educated in the public school at Bellevue until 1882. He attended the public schools in Omaha, Nebraska from 1882 to 1892. He graduated from Omaha High School in 1892 as the class valedictorian. Williams College In 1892, Clarke enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts and played on the college's varsity baseball team. In 1893, he made his debut in a victory over the Yale Law School. The New York Times reported: \\"Williams had a new pitcher, Clarke, '96 during the first half of the game. He did creditably but showed lack of experience.\\" A later article made note of Clarke's pitching skills as a sophomore in 1894: \\"He will be remembered by Eastern college men for good work in the box his sophomore year at Williams College, when he gave Lewis a close rub for the position of 'Varsity pitcher.'\\" In May 1894, The New York Times reported that Clarke had been \\"fairly effective,\\" except in the first inning, and hit a \\"beautiful home run\\" in a loss to Harvard. University of Chicago In the fall of 1894, he transferred to the University of Chicago. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1896 and remained there for a year of post- graduate work. He played for Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons football team in 1895 and 1896, and also played for the Stagg's Chicago Maroons baseball team in 1895, 1896 and 1897. He was the captain of Chicago's 1897 baseball team. Chicago's baseball team compiled records of 15-5, 19-11, and 17-4 during the three years Clarke was a player. In a review of the 1897 baseball season, Outing magazine wrote: \\"Henry Clarke, their captain, has proved himself an able leader and is head and shoulders above every other pitcher in this section.\\" The Chicago Daily Tribune gave much of the credit for Chicago's 1897 record to Clarke: \\"The largest element in the success of the institution by the Midway was the phenomenal pitching of Henry Clarke. If victory can be accredited to any one man that man was Clarke last year.\\" While attending the University of Chicago, Clarke was also president of his class, president of the glee club, and a member of the Lion's Head and the O. & S. senior honorary society. Major League Baseball In May 1897, Clarke won a tryout with the Boston Beaneaters. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported that, during Clarke's tryout, Boston manager Frank Selee had been remarked that Clarke had \\"good speed, an excellent change of pace, combined with curves that kept the Boston men guessing.\\" Clarke signed instead with the Cleveland Spiders, joining a pitching staff that included Cy Young. Between June 26 and August 2, 1897, Clarke appeared in five games for Cleveland, compiling a record of 0 wins and 4 losses and an earned run average of 5.87. Clarke also appeared in two games as an outfielder in 1897 and compiled a batting average of .280. Clarke also briefly returned to Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Chicago Orphans in 1898. He appeared in only one game as a pitcher for Chicago, a 5-4 victory over the Cleveland Spiders. His 1898 record was 1-0 with a 2.00 earned run average. University of Michigan Clarke enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School in the fall of 1897. He received his law degree from Michigan in June 1899. While attending law school, he served as the assistant coach of the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in 1898 and the head coach in 1899. In February 1899, The Michigan Alumnus wrote: > Next to the presence of a lot of new player the question of having a good > all round coach is important.

In addition to his position as head coach, Clarke also appeared as a player in several of Michigan's games in 1899. In mid-April 1899, the Wolverines played two games against Milwaukee, a professional baseball team from the Western League. After Michigan gave up seven runs in the second game, Clarke came into the game as a pitcher and pitched the final six innings. He held the Milwaukee team scoreless for two innings, but he gave up eight runs in the sixth inning, two in the seventh and one in the eighth. Michigan lost the game 18-1. Clarke also appeared in two games against the Hamilton Club of Chicago in May 1899. Michigan won both games by scores of 4-3 and 6-1. During Clarke's two seasons as a baseball coach, the team compiled records of 15-6 and 14-5 and finished 2nd and 1st in the Western Conference. Clarke was also the coach of Michigan's all-freshman football team in 1898. Legal and political career In the fall of 1899, Clarke was admitted to the Illinois bar and joined the Chicago law firm of Church, McMurdy & Sherman. Clarke returned to Nebraska in 1900 and established a law partnership with Frank Crawford, a classmate from the University of Michigan who also served as Michigan's first football coach in 1891. They practiced law together as Crawford & Clarke from 1900 to 1905. In 1904, Clarke was elected as a Republican to the Nebraska House of Representatives. He was reelected to the same office in 1906. Clarke was the sponsor of a child labor bill that passed the Nebraska legislature and was signed into law in 1907. He was also active in the passage of a pure food law. In March 1907, Clarke was appointed as a Nebraska railroad commissioner by Governor George L. Sheldon, following a vacancy on the commission. He was elected to the position in a special election in the fall of 1907. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1910. Clarke worked from at least 1918 to 1920 as a traffic manager and attorney for the Omaha Grain Exchange.Draft Registration Card dated September 11, 1918 completed by Henry Tefft Clark [sic] of Omaha, Nebraska, listing his date of birth as August 4, 1875, and his occupation as a traffic manager for the Omaha Grain Exchange.

Family and later years Clarke was married in September 1901 to Grace Louise Allen. They had three children, Allen Gordon Clarke, William Cleveland Clarke and Henry T. Clarke III. Clarke spent the last year of his life at the Emory John Brady Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He reportedly suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He died in Colorado Springs in March 1950 at age 74.

Illinois, 146 U.S. 387 (1892), reaffirmed that each state in its sovereign capacity holds permanent title to all submerged lands within its borders and holds these lands in public trust.. This is a foundational case for the public trust doctrine. The Supreme Court held a four to three split decision that the State of Illinois did not possess the authority to grant fee title to submerged lands held in the public trust as navigable waters. Background In the mid-19th century, Chicago was growing rapidly and was becoming increasingly interested in creating an outer harbor at the junction of Lake Michigan and the Chicago River because local currents often resulted in either the formation of sandbars or areas of erosion, increasing congestion and complicating navigation. Then, in 1851, the Illinois Central Railroad Company made an offer to the City of Chicago that in exchange for allowing tracks to be laid along the lake front, the railroad company would pay for and build a breakwater to protect the harbor.Chase, C.S. 2010.

To further confirm their rights to this area, the railroad lobbied the state, and in 1869, the State of Illinois passed the Lake Front Act, granting Illinois Central \\"appropriation, occupancy, use and control\\" of a large portion of the harbor. The legislature's goal in passing the act was to bring a new train depot, an outer harbor and better parks to the residents of Chicago. The portion of land stretched from present-day West Randolph Street south to Twelfth Street, and from South Michigan Avenue east into Lake Michigan. However, due to political controversy and poor public opinion of the railroad company, the legislature repealed the Lake Front Act in 1873. Both before and after the repeal, Illinois Central continued to construct tracks, piers and other facilities along the lake front. This construction also included filling in several hundred feet into Lake Michigan to provide land for these new facilities. On March 1, 1883 the Illinois Attorney General filed suit against Illinois Central in order to stop construction on the land known as Lake Park. =Procedural history= In 1883, Illinois filed suit in state court against the Illinois Central Railroad Company, asking the court to determine who possessed title to submerged lands under Lake Michigan adjacent to the Chicago shoreline. Illinois also sought a court order to remove structures the railroad company had constructed over the lakebed, as well as an injunction against Illinois Central continuing this construction. Upon motion, the case was removed to the federal Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Justice Harlan, then a circuit-court judge, ruled that the state held title to the submerged lands, and therefore had the right to revoke the license granted to Illinois Central in the Act, which Illinois Central had contested. This decision also established that the City of Chicago held title to the land of Lake Park (present day Millennium Park). Illinois Central appealed to the Supreme Court. =Parties= The petitioners were Illinois Central Railroad Company, a corporation created by act of the Illinois State legislature and the city of Chicago, which was added as a party at trial because of its interest in the case. The respondent was the state of Illinois. =Issues= #Whether the state of Illinois possessed the authority to grant title to its lands submerged by navigable waters. #Whether Illinois Central Railroad Company acquired riparian rights to the lake bed immediately adjacent to the lakefront property to which it possessed title. =Arguments= Illinois Central‚Äôs arguments Illinois Central Railroad asserted three arguments in support of their claim on a portion of the lakebed under Lake Michigan. First, Illinois Central argued it had been granted by the state and by city ordinance a wide corridor into the lake to construct a raised railway track, pier and warehouses. Second, Illinois Central argued that they had acquired riparian rights by virtue of their ownership of lands surrounding the lake. Third, the railroad company argued they had received title to a bounded parcel of submerged lakebed from the State of Illinois in 1869. State of Illinois‚Äôs argument In seeking to enjoin the railroad, the state claimed \\"title to the bed of Lake Michigan, and exclusive right to develop and improve the harbor of Chicago by the construction of docks, wharves, piers, and other improvements‚Ä¶.\\" Decision =Majority Opinion of the Court= Writing for the majority, Justice Field affirmed the lower court's holding that the state held title to the lakebed. Field found that Illinois lacked the authority to grant title to submerged lands held in the public trust with two exceptions ‚Äì for grants not impairing the public interest and grants that actually improved the public trust. But neither exception was found to apply in this case and therefore the railroad did not possess title. Justice Field expressed the doctrine of public trust as follows: > \\"It is the settled law of this country that the ownership of and dominion > and sovereignty over lands covered by tide waters, within the limits of the > several states, belong to the respective states within which they are found, > with the consequent right to use or dispose of any portion thereof, when > that can be done without substantial impairment of the interest of the > public in the waters, and subject always to the paramount right of congress > to control their navigation so far as may be necessary for the regulation of > commerce with foreign nations and among the states\\" Justice Field determined that the public trust doctrine applies to the Great Lakes, despite the fact that they are not subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. Initially, the United States adopted English Common law which limited the definition of navigable waters to those that were subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. In the United States the tidal requirement was removed because many rivers can be navigated for great distances by large commercial vessels. Great Lakes, while not subject to the tides, are the conduit of a great deal of transnational and interstate commerce, and it was this value the common law sought to protect in the public trust doctrine. The public trust doctrine limits private property rights to lands submerged by navigable waters. The Great Lakes are owned in common to be preserved for the common good, and no private encroachment is allowed. Justice Field argued that the 1869 grant Illinois made to Illinois Central Railroad was merely a grant of the right to lay track, not a transfer of title to a portion of the lakebed. The grant was expressly limited to this purpose and it particularly limited the transfer of a right of way across the lake so as not to interrupt the navigation of streams. Justice Field agreed with Illinois Central that title to land bordering navigable waters carries with it the right to access these waters and to develop a pier for personal or public use. However, this right extends only to the \\"navigable point\\" of the water. Since no evidence had been presented indicating that the railroad's pier and docks extended that far, Justice Field remanded this particular issue back to the lower court. The 1869 act establishing the Illinois Central Railroad Company, granted the company title to a section of the submerged lakebed of Lake Michigan. The state legislature later repealed this piece of legislation. Justice Field posed the question whether the legislature was authorized to transfer title to the submerged lake bed in the first place. It is up to courts to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a state legislature's transfer of rights to submerged lands sufficiently protects the public interest. In this case, Illinois Central was granted unrestricted rights to an enormous, section of submerged land, which occupied the entire aquatic area bordering the Chicago harbor. Justice Field found the state can never permanently transfer authority over these submerged lands, but only grant revocable permissions to them. Therefore, the Illinois state legislature's original grant had no effect on the state of Illinois's ultimate authority over the submerged land. =Justice Shiras' Dissenting Opinion= Justice Shiras agreed that ownership of state lands extends to those lands submerged under its navigable waters; however, Shiras argued that the grant of the submerged lands by the state legislature functioned like any land transfer contract and effectively transferred title to Illinois Central. Shiras pointed out that the act granting the submerged lands expressly denied Illinois Central the rights to resell or transfer the lands or to impair the public right to navigation. Shiras makes it clear that this dissenting opinion does not contradict the point that states cannot transfer control of the public's rights to navigable waters, however, these rights are only violated once Illinois Central acts to obstruct them. To otherwise empower the legislature to revoke legislative acts granting property rights would offend \\"the right of the citizens to the free enjoyment of their property legally acquired.\\" Importance Though Illinois Central is frequently cited as the source for American public trust law, it was several decades before, in Martin v. Waddell‚Äôs Lessee, that the Supreme Court ratified the public trust doctrine. Still, Illinois Central has been referred to as \\"the Lodestar in American Public Trust Law\\". As of 2010, the courts of 35 states had cited Illinois Central in their articulation of the public trust doctrine.

Native to the Colorado River Basin of the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico, it was formerly an important food fish for both Native Americans and European settlers. Once abundant and widespread in the basin, its numbers have declined to the point where it has been extirpated from the Mexican part of its range and was listed as endangered in the US part in 1967, a fate shared by the three other large Colorado Basin endemic fish species: bonytail chub, humpback chub, and razorback sucker. The Colorado pikeminnow is currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Description Like the other three species of pikeminnows, it has an elongated body reminiscent of the pike. The cone-shaped and somewhat flattened head is elongated, forming nearly a quarter of the body length. Color grades from bright olive green on the back to a paler yellowish shade on the flanks, to white underneath. Young fish also have a dark spot on the caudal fin. Both the dorsal and anal fins typically have 9 rays. The pharyngeal teeth are long and hooked. The reports of 6-ft individuals are estimates from skeletal remains, but a number of community elders, interviewed by the Salt Lake Tribune in 1994, reported that such individuals were once common. Catches in the 1960s ranged up to 60 cm for 11-year-old fish, but by the early 1990s, maximum sizes reached no more than 34 cm. Biologists now consider the typical size of an adult pikeminnow to be between 4 and 9 pounds, and reports of the fish lately exceeding 3 feet in length are now in question. Biology Young pikeminnows, up to 5 cm long, eat cladocerans, copepods, and chironomid larvae, then shift to insects around 10 cm long, gradually eating more fish as they mature. Once they achieve a length around 30 cm, they feed almost entirely upon fish. This fish has an ontogenetic separation of life history stage. The altricial young emerge from whitewater canyons, enter the drift as sac-fry, and are transported downstream. Habitat for the young fish is predominately alongshore backwaters and associated shorelines of more alluvial reaches of the turbulent and turbid rivers of the Colorado system. In contrast, adults reside in more well-defined channels, where they seek eddy habitats and prey on suckers and minnows. Colorado pikeminnows are potamodromous, making freshwater spawning migrations to home in on their natal areas. These migrations can begin as upstream or downstream movements, depending on the location of home range of individuals, and may involve 100 km or more.H.M. Tyus.2012. Ecology and conservation of fishes. Taylor and Francis Group, CRC Press, Boca Raton, London and New York Spawning occurs around the summer solstice, with declining flows and increasing temperatures. Breeding males are bronze-colored and heavily covered with tubercles, while females are generally larger, lighter in color and with fewer tubercles. As the fish reach the spawning location, they stage in deeper pools and eddies and make spawning runs into nearby runs and deep riffles, where the adhesive eggs are released. Upon hatching and swim-up, the small fry are entrained and carried 50‚Äì100 km downstream.H.M. Tyus. 1990. Potamodromy and reproduction of Colorado squawfish in the Green River basin of Utah. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 119:1035-1047 Range The species was once found throughout the Colorado Basin, so occurred in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, as well as in Mexico. Damming and habitat alterations have confined the species to the upper Colorado drainage; currently, remnant populations are known from the Green, Gunnison, White, San Juan, and Yampa Rivers. They have been transplanted to the Salt and Verde Rivers, both within their native range.  Population Reduction Efforts  Additionally, land managers in the past have attempted to reduce the native fish population of the Colorado Basin in favor of sport fishing. In the mid-1960s, the federal government poured the poison rotenone into the Green and San Juan Rivers, attempting to create an environment supportive of non-native sportfish.Lisa Kearsley (2002). Guide to The San Juan River. Flagstaff, Arizona: Shiva Press In September 1962, the Green River was poisoned beginning upstream of Flaming Gorge. The poison worked downstream for 3 days until it reached upstream of Dinosaur National Monument. Potassium permanganate was used to neutralize the rotenone, but concentrations were higher than expected and rotenone continued into the Dinosaur National Monument area.An Entirely Synthetic Fish (Yale University Press, 2010)Restoring Colorado River Ecosystems (Island Press 2007) Recovery efforts Recovery efforts are focused on operating dams to create more natural flow patterns, improving fish passage up- and downstream, and restricting stocking of non-native fish to reduce ecological interactions. Thus far, progress in recovering this pikeminnow has been limited. References * William F. Sigler and John W.

Starting his editing career with Harcourt, Brace & Co., he was hired away to work for Roger W. Straus, Jr. at Farrar & Straus in 1955, where he became a partner and, eventually, its chairman. The firm was henceforth known as Farrar, Straus and Giroux, where he was known by his nickname, \\"Bob\\".Arts, Jersey City, People ¬ª Remembering Robert Giroux, Jersey City's literary lion by Jason Fink. September 11, 2008. In his career stretching over five decades, he edited some of the most important voices of the 20th century, including T.S. Eliot, George Orwell, Virginia Woolf, Thomas Merton, and published the first books of Jack Kerouac, Flannery O'Connor, Jean Stafford, Bernard Malamud, William Gaddis, Susan Sontag, Larry Woiwode and Randall Jarrell and edited no fewer than seven Nobel laureates: Eliot, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Derek Walcott, Nadine Gordimer, Seamus Heaney, William Golding and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. In a 1980 profile in the New York Times Book Review, poet Donald Hall wrote, \\"He is the only living editor whose name is bracketed with that of Maxwell Perkins,\\" the editor of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Early life and education The youngest of five children, Giroux was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, to Arthur J. Giroux, a foreman for a silk manufacturer, and Katharine Lyons Giroux, a grade-school teacher. Robert Giroux was one of five children: Arnold, Lester, Estele, Josephine and Robert, and grew up in the old Irish-Catholic West Side of Jersey City. His sisters Josephine and Estelle both left high school to work and contribute money so that Bob could continue his education. He has three nieces, Maclovia, Kathleen and Roberta, whom he was close to throughout his life. He attended Regis High School in Manhattan, but dropped out during the Depression, to take a job with local newspaper, the Jersey Journal. (He eventually received his diploma 57 years later, in 1988.) Giroux received a scholarship to attend Columbia College of Columbia University, intending to study journalism. Soon, though, he found himself drawn to literature. His main classroom mentors were the poet and critic Mark Van Doren and Raymond Weaver, the first biographer of Herman Melville, who had discovered the novella, Billy Budd in manuscript form in 1924. \\"Imagine discovering a masterpiece..., as he later noted, \\"a great book is often ahead of its time, and the trick is how to keep it afloat until the times catch up with it\\". At Columbia, too, Giroux met a number of contemporaries who were destined for greatness in arts and letters, among them his classmate John Berryman, Herman Wouk, Thomas Merton, Ad Reinhardt, and John Latouche. In addition to writing film reviews for The Nation, Giroux became president of the Philolexian Society and editor of the literary magazine The Columbia Review, where he published some of Berryman's and Merton's earliest works. Upon graduating in 1936, he declined Van Doren's offer of a Kellett Fellowship at Cambridge University; the fellowship went to Berryman instead. Career Giroux started his career with a job with the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in public relations. After working there for four years, he found his first editing job as a junior editor, at Harcourt, Brace & Company in 1940. Among the first works he edited was Edmund Wilson's work on 19th-century socialist thinkers, To the Finland Station (1940), which was to become a classic. During World War II, Giroux enlisted in the US Navy in 1942 and served aboard the USS Essex in air combat intelligence as an intelligence officer until 1945, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander. After leaving the navy, he took his article about the rescue of a fighter pilot downed at the Battle of Truk Lagoon in the Pacific to a Navy public information Office in New York, where the officer in charge, Lt. Roger W. Straus Jr., suggested that he could get him $1,000 by selling it to a mass publication. \\"Rescue at Truk\\" ran in Collier's and was later widely anthologized. He published an article about the \\"Capture at Truk\\" which made the cover of Life magazine. In 1948, Giroux rejoined Harcourt, where he became executive editor and worked the supervision of Frank Morley, a former director of Faber & Faber. He published many novels rejected by other publishing houses, such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (1952), Kerouac's The Town and the City (1950) and O'Connor's Wise Blood (1952). He also worked on Thomas Merton's autobiography, The Seven Storey Mountain (1948). KO Soon he became adept at finding new authors, and one of his first finds was the novelist and short-story writer Jean Stafford, who in turn introduced him to her husband, Robert Lowell, who was trying to find a publisher for his second book of poems. Impressed by Lowell's manuscript, Giroux published the collection Lord Weary's Castle immediately, and it went on to win the 1947 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. In a PBS documentary on Lowell, Giroux states that it was the most successful book of poems that he ever published.Voices and Visions Video Series. Robert Lowell. 1988. In 1947, Frank Morley left the company and returned to London, and a year later, Giroux was promoted to editor-in-chief, reporting to Eugene Reynal, an Ivy League scholar whom Brace had brought in to replace Morley. This development did not turn out amicably for the two. In a 2000 interview with George Plimpton in The Paris Review, he called Reynal tactless and a \\"terrible snob\\". From 1948 to 1955, Giroux continued to edit important works. By 1951, his reputation as America's foremost editor had attracted foreign writers. For example, in 1951, he published Hannah Arendt's first book in English, The Origins of Totalitarianism. Of his seven Nobel prize winners, who included Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Derek Walcott, William Golding, Seamus Heaney, and Nadine Gordimer, the only one born in the United States was T.S. Eliot. After Alfred Harcourt and Donald Brace died, Giroux decided to move. In the same Plimton interview, he revealed how as a young editor at Harcourt, Brace & Co., he won the opportunity to publish The Catcher in the Rye, the 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger, but lost it after the textbook department noted \\"Not for us\\", rejecting the manuscript. He soon started looking around and in 1955 he joined Farrar, Straus & Company, run by his fellow Second World War veterans John Farrar and Roger Straus, as editor-in-chief. Almost twenty of his writers at Harcourt eventually followed him, including Eliot, Lowell, O'Connor, and Malamud. In 1959, Malamud's The Magic Barrel became FSG's first National Book Award winner. Farrar, Straus & Company made him a partner in 1964, giving the company its new name, Farrar, Straus and Giroux (FSG). Robert Lowell's book of poems, For the Union Dead (1964) was the first book to bear his imprint. He became company's chairman in 1973. Among the writers Giroux discovered or developed at FSG were Jack Kerouac, John Berryman, Jean Stafford, Bernard Malamud, Thomas Merton, Flannery O'Connor, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Carl Sandburg, Elizabeth Bishop, Katherine Anne Porter, Walker Percy, Donald Barthelme, Grace Paley, Derek Walcott and William Golding. By 2000, FSG books had won 29 literary awards, as well as a dozen Pulitzer Prizes and 20 Nobel Prizes. Giroux worked with Kerouac on his first novel, The Town and the City, and on the manuscript for his Beat classic On the Road. The former was dedicated to him. In a documentary interview, Giroux recalled how he tried to explain to Kerouac that the novel, typed out on a huge, single roll of paper, needed to be worked on, to which Kerouac replied: \\"There shall be no editing of this manuscript, this manuscript was dictated by the Holy Ghost.\\" Among the notable works he published as an editor were a collection of Berryman's critical prose as The Freedom of the Poet (1976), Collected Prose of Robert Lowell (1987), and Collected Prose of Elizabeth Bishop (1984), whose letters he later edited, as One Art (1994). He also authored The Education of an Editor, The Book Known as Q: A Consideration of Shakespeare's Sonnets (1982), and A Deed of Death (1990), an investigation of the 1922 murder of the Hollywood director William Desmond Taylor. His relationship with Straus was often strained. Giroux, more the literary man, was often at odds with Straus, who was primarily a businessman. Farrar, Straus & Giroux never published his 25th-anniversary anthology, which he also edited, as Straus took offense to his portrayal in Giroux's introduction. Giroux did not complete his memoirs because he said he did not want to write negatively about Straus. For his part, Straus counted Giroux's joining his company as the significant event in its history. Once Giroux suggested to Eliot that editors were mostly failed writers, to which Eliot replied: \\"so are most writers\\". From 1975 to 1982, he was president of the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, an organization that fights movie censorship. Awards and honors Giroux received an honorary doctorate from Seton Hall University in 1999,New York Times 11/7/1999 the Mayoral Award of Honor for Art and Culture from the City of New York in 1989,New York Times 6/28/1989 and the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in Arts and Letters from New York University in 1988.New York Times 11/15/1988 He also received the Alexander Hamilton Medal, the Columbia College Alumni Association's highest honor, in 1987, the same year he received the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award at the National Book Critics Circle Award. He was awarded a Special Citation at the National Board of Review Awards 1989. In 2006, he was presented with the Philolexian Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement. Marriage In 1952, Giroux married Do√±a Carmen Natica de Arango y del Valle (common name: Carmen de Arango) (died 1999), an advisor to the Holy See Missions Delegation to the United Nations they divorced in 1969. Do√±a Carmen de Arango was the younger daughter of Cuban aristocrat Don Francisco de Arango, 3rd Marquis de la Gratitud, and his wife, the former Do√±a Petronilla del Valle, and she had been previously engaged to Thomas O'Connor Sloane 3rd and Don Julio Lafitte, Count de Lugar Nuevo. After the death of her sister, Do√±a Mercedes, the 4th Marquise in 1998, Do√±a Carmen de Arango Giroux became the 5th Marquise de la Gratitud. Notwithstanding his marriage and its relative longevity, which suggest ambivalence about his sexuality and self-imposed closeting, Robert Gottlieb remembers that Giroux was in a relationship with the same man for fifty years, starting in the late fifties and that his \\"homosexuality was known and disregarded\\" at FSG.Robert Gottlieb, \\"Anatomy of a Publisher: The Story of Farrar, Straus and Giroux\\", The New Yorker, August 12 & 19, 2013, pp. 82-8, quote p. 84 Al Silverstein interviewed Giroux in 2004 and stated that Giroux was accompanied by Charles Reilly, who had been with Bob since they first met in grammar school in Union City, New Jersey. Death Giroux died on September 5, 2008 at Seabrook Village, an independent-living center, in Tinton Falls, New Jersey, aged 94. At his memorial at Columbia University's St. Paul's Chapel, Paul Elie, another editor said, \\"It is tempting to float an analogy between his death and the death of a certain kind of publishing. But the fact is that his kind of publishing was rare in his own time, and so was he.\\" Notes  External links  * Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Official website * Category:1914 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American book publishers (people) Category:Columbia College (New York) alumni Category:Businesspeople from Jersey City, New Jersey Category:People from Tinton Falls, New Jersey Category:United States Navy officers Category:American book editors Category:National Book Critics Circle Award- winning works Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:American editors Category:American male writers Category:Writers from Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Regis High School (New York City) alumni ","title":"Robert Giroux"},{"id":"8872450","text":"David Todros is a fictional character from a series of historical mystery novels written by Elizabeth Peters and featuring fictional sleuth and archaeologist Amelia Peabody.

From the beginning, Evelyn is very supportive of him. David and Ramses become best friends, and later on blood brothers. They are very much alike and could pass for brothers, as they do later on in the series. After a few years, in a difficult moment for the entire family, David and Lia, Walter‚Äôs eldest daughter, fall in love. This being Edwardian England, such a marriage is not readily accepted by many. Walter and Evelyn feel betrayed, believing that the two went behind their backs for years. Even Amelia has difficulty with the relationship, until Emerson‚Äôs obvious acceptance forces her to realize that she must accept people for who they are, not for what society takes them to be. David soon becomes a renowned illustrator, receiving frequent commissions from many sources. He and Lia also become parents at a rate to rival Walter and Evelyn. The greatest difficulty David encounters is his support for the independence of Egypt from England. He becomes associated with some of the more radical groups and even spends time in exile at an oasis.

The Interpolation Theory suggests that the sporophyte generation progenated from a haploid, green algal thallus in which repeated mitotic cell divisions of a zygote produced an embryo retained on the thallus and gave rise to the diploid phase (sporophyte). Ensuing evolution caused the sporophyte to become increasingly complex, both organographically and anatomically. The Interpolation Theory was introduced by ƒåelakovsk√Ω (1874) as the Antithetic Theory. Bower (1889) further developed this theory and renamed it the Interpolation Theory. The theory was later supported by Overton (1893), Scott (1896), Strasburger (1897), Williams (1904), and others. The gradual evolution of an independent, sporophyte phase was viewed by Bower as being closely related to the transition from aquatic to terrestrial plant life on Earth. Evidence supporting this theory can be found in the life cycle of modern Bryophytes in which the sporophyte is physiologically dependent on the gametophyte. Competing theories include the Transformation theory, which was introduced as the Homologous theory by ƒåelakovsk√Ω, and also renamed by Bower. References * Gifford, Ernest M. and Adriance S. Foster.

Also As a result of the current conflict, Palestinian olive farmers have faced the uprooting of many of their crops and also suffer from a lack of access to their farms due to the security fence. Zaytoun operates within the Palestinian Occupied Territories to establish cooperatives that enable farmers to improve the quality of their oil and to highlight the impact of the conflict on poverty. Up to 100,000 families depend upon the olive harvest for their livelihoods to some extent. Zaytoun is supported by UK charity War on Want amongst others. They were awarded Fairtrade certification for their olive oil in March 2009 Income and investment Since its inception in 2004, Zaytoun has imported and distributed 170 tons of olive oil to retail and wholesale customers, in addition to regional fair-trade and Palestine campaign groups. Jewish, Muslim and Christian faith groups have also taken an interest, ordering the oil for their places of worship and to sell at local stalls as part of a message of inter-faith peace promotion. Southwark Cathedral uses the olive oil for anointing in services. Any profits Zaytoun makes are invested in product development in partnership with their suppliers, in local producer support projects run by NGOs such as Oxfam and War on Want, put straight back into acquiring more stock to meet growing demand and invested in working with a volunteer harvest team. As the economic crisis deepens, for many the olive harvest provides their main means of survival. Between 2004 and 2009, Zaytoun sold over 170 tons of olive oil, bringing well over ¬£1 million in income to producing communities. In addition, Zaytoun's policy of, wherever possible, ensuring all labeling and packaging takes place in the Palestinian territories, creates further employment opportunities. Zaytoun supports Palestinian producers by selling other artisan produce including dates, almonds, couscous, za‚Äôatar herbs, soap and olives. Both the olives and the oil are certified organic and Fairtrade. Fairtrade certification Zaytoun marked Fairtrade Fortnight (23 Feb ‚Äì 8 March 2009) with the launch of the first ever Fairtrade-certified olive oil and olives, direct from Palestinian farms. UK business Zaytoun CIC, a Community Interest Company, created a market for Palestinian olive oil in 2004, importing the products direct from farming communities, and launched a Fairtrade-certified range in Britain. The Fairtrade certification of registered small farmers associations will support and encourage the Palestinian producers to work collectively and be stronger in vocalising their desire to farm in peace. The mark will also increase their access to international markets, provide opportunities to earn more sustainable incomes and improve future prospects for their communities. Zaytoun South Africa Zaytoun, the company that launched the world's first Fairtrade olive oil, is now giving South African citizens the chance to access Palestinian Fairtrade produce. Zaytoun is a Fair Trade company and a member of WFTO. In 2009 it launched the world's first Fairtrade olive oil, a tribute to the hard work of the Palestinian producers and processors with whom they work.

It was merged into the Mass communication specialist rating on 1 July 2006. History The father of naval photography, Walter Leroy \\"Dick\\" Richardson, enlisted as a ship's cook on 1 November 1911. In 1914 he transferred to Naval Air Station Pensacola, where his hobby of photography earned him the designation of Official Station Photographer. Richardson reenlisted as an Aviation machinist's mate in 1915 and, after attending the Army school of aerial photography at Langley Air Force Base, organized the Navy's photographic section of Bureau of Navigation. In 1918 Richardson was commissioned as an officer of the Naval Reserve Flying Corps at the first Navy photo school at NAS Miami, Florida. When World War I ended Lieutenant (junior grade) Richardson and a few enlisted personnel opened a school at Anacostia training navy photographers for still photography, aerial photography, motion picture photography, developing and printing. The school moved to NAS Pensacola in 1923, and the first navy photographic training textbook was published in 1927. As World War II unfolded in Europe, a Navy officer was sent to England to observe and adopt British photo interpretation methods. He returned to set up the Navy's first photographic interpretation school. As the war expanded, Navy photographers were trained by Movietone News, Kodak, and Fairchild Camera and Instrument company. Many civilian photographers fulfilled their military obligation serving in combat photography units (CPUs). The war saw 1.500 naval officers and 5,300 enlisted men trained at the Navy photography school. The Navy Photographic Science Laboratory established at Washington, D.C. in 1943 was later renamed the Naval Photographic Center. In 1948, the photographer's mate abbreviation changed from PHOM to PH, and the symbol of the camera on the rating badge was replaced by divergent light rays passing through a lens. As jet aircraft appeared, the old film width was replaced by and then film in larger cameras. The RF-8 Crusader was replaced by the RA-5 Vigilante aboard super carriers equipped with a chute from the flight deck to a photo darkroom so film packages detached from the aircraft upon landing could be fed into developing machines to be available for debriefing when the pilot reached his ready room. Navy photographers were sent to the University of Southern California to study motion picture production techniques, and to Syracuse University for photojournalism training.

It has 13 alternate red and white stripes representing the original Thirteen Colonies and the British Union Jack flag, in a square in the upper left-hand corner. *1776 May - A popular legend promulgated by the descendants of Betsy Ross of Philadelphia during the 1870s holds that the seamstress sewed the first American flag. The claim is widely discredited by researchers and historians.Marc Leepson, \\"Five myths about the American flag\\", The Washington Post, June 12, 2011, p. B2. *1777 June 14 - Continental Congress adopts the following: \\"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\\" *1787 - Captain Robert Gray carries the flag around the world on his sailing vessel (around the tip of South America, to China, and beyond). *1795 - Flag with 15 stars and 15 stripes designed - often with unique red stripe under the blue field/canton (added Vermont, Kentucky to the original Thirteen Colonies stars) *1814 September 14 - Francis Scott Key writes the four stanza poem \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". It becomes the official national anthem of the United States in 1931. The unique 15-star, 15-stripe design with a red stripe under the blue canton with stars (used from 1795 to 1818) of the huge flag made by Mary Young Pickersgill later seen by Key flying over Fort McHenry outside Baltimore in September 1814 during the Battle of Baltimore in a British attack becomes known as the \\"Star Spangled Banner Flag\\". *1818 - Flag with 20 stars and returned to the 13 stripes design of alternating red and white colors of 1777. It remains at 13 stripes hereafter to the present with only stars added for additional states admitted to the Union, on next following Independence Day, July 4. (Tennessee (1796), Ohio (1803), Louisiana (1812), Indiana (1816), Mississippi (1817) added from previous years). (An unofficial 16-star, 16-stripe flag had been made in Tennessee, and an unofficial 17-star, 13-stripe flag in Ohio.) *1819 - Flag with 21 stars (Illinois) *1820 - Flag with 23 stars (Alabama, Maine) first flag on Pikes Peak, (located in future Colorado) *1822 - Flag with 24 stars (Missouri) *1836 - Flag with 25 stars (Arkansas) *1837 - Flag with 26 stars (Michigan) *1845 - Flag with 27 stars (Florida) *1846 - Flag with 28 stars (Texas) *1847 - Flag with 29 stars (Iowa) *1848 - Flag with 30 stars (Wisconsin) *1851 - Flag with 31 stars (California) *1858 - Flag with 32 stars (Minnesota) *1859 - Flag with 33 stars (Oregon) *1861 - Flag with 34 stars; (Kansas). Even after the Southern states seceded from the Union, establishing the Confederate States of America, 16th President Abraham Lincoln would not allow any star to be removed from the American flag. The first National Flag of the Confederacy (nicknamed \\"The Stars and Bars\\") is adopted by the provisional government in the temporary capital of Montgomery, Alabama *1863 - Flag with 35 stars (West Virginia, western counties withdrew from seceded Virginia) *1865 - Flag with 36 stars (Nevada) *1867 - Flag with 37 stars (Nebraska) *1869 - First flag on a U.S. postage stamp *1876 - Flag with 38 stars (Colorado) *1889 - Flag with 39 stars that never was. Flag manufacturers mistakenly believed that the two Dakotas would be admitted instead as one state and so manufactured this flag, some of which still exist. It was never an official flag. *1890 - Flag with 42 stars that never was. It was anticipated that Idaho would be admitted after July 4 and manufacturers tried to get a headstart by making 42 star flags. Idaho was admitted on July 3rd. As Wyoming was admitted July 10, few of the official 43 star flags were manufactured. *1890 - Flag with 43 stars (North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho) *1891 - Flag with 44 stars (Wyoming) *1892 - \\"Pledge of Allegiance\\" first published in a magazine called \\"The Youth's Companion\\", written by Francis Bellamy. Revised in 1954. *1896 - Flag with 45 stars (Utah) *1897 - Adoption of State Flag Desecration Statutes ‚Äì By the late 1800s an organized flag protection movement was born in reaction to perceived commercial and political misuse of the flag. After supporters failed to obtain federal legislation, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota became the first States to adopt flag desecration statutes. By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag. Under the model flag desecration law, the term \\"flag\\" was defined to include any flag, standard, ensign, or color, or any representation of such made of any substance whatsoever and of any size that evidently purported to be said flag or a picture or representation thereof, upon which shall be shown the colors, the stars and stripes in any number, or by which the person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the U.S. *1907 - Halter v. Nebraska (205 U.S. 34) ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court held that although the flag was a federal creation, the States' had the authority to promulgate flag desecration laws under their general police power to safeguard public safety and welfare. Halter involved a conviction of two businessmen selling \\"Stars and Stripes\\" brand beer with representations of the U.S. flag affixed to the labels. The defendants did not raise any constitutional First Amendment claim. *1908 - Flag with 46 stars (Oklahoma) *1909 - Explorer Robert Peary places the flag his wife sewed atop the North Pole. He left pieces of another flag along the way. He was never censured for his action. *1912 - Flag with 48 stars (New Mexico, Arizona) completing \\"Lower 48\\" continental U.S. Becomes longest serving flag of 47 years 1912‚Äì1959. (An unofficial 47-star flag was made for commemorative purposes in New Mexico.) *1931 - Stromberg v. California (283 U.S. 359) ‚Äì The Supreme Court found that a State statute prohibiting the display of a \\"red flag\\" as a sign of opposition to organized government unconstitutionally infringed on the defendant's First Amendment rights. Stromberg represented the Court's first declaration that \\"symbolic speech\\" was protected by the First Amendment. *1942 - Federal Flag Code (36 U.S.C. 171 et seq.) ‚Äì On June 22, 1942, 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved the Federal Flag Code, providing for uniform guidelines for the display and respect shown to the flag. The Flag Code does not prescribe any penalties for non-compliance nor does it include any enforcement provisions, rather it functions simply as a guide for voluntary civilian compliance. *1943 - West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette (319 U.S. 624) ‚Äì The Supreme Court held that public school children could not be compelled to salute the U.S. flag. In a now famous passage, Justice Robert H. Jackson highlighted the importance of freedom of expression under the First Amendment: Freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order. If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion. *1945 - The flag that flew over Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii on Sunday, December 7, 1941, is flown over the White House on August 14, 1945, \\"V-J Day\\" when the Japanese accepted surrender terms. *1949 August 3 - 34th President Harry Truman signs bill requesting the President call for a Flag Day (June 14th) observance each year by proclamation. *1954 - By act of Congress, the words \\"Under God\\" are inserted into the Pledge of Allegiance *1959 - Flag with 49 stars (Alaska) *1960 - Flag with 50 stars (Hawaii) *1963 - American Flag placed on top of Mount Everest in Himalayas Mountains in Nepal (tallest in the world), by Barry Bishop. *1968 - Adoption of Federal Flag Desecration Law (18 U.S.C. 700 et seq.) ‚Äì Congress approved the first federal flag desecration law in the wake of a highly publicized Central Park flag burning incident in New York City in protest of the Vietnam War. The federal law made it illegal to \\"knowingly\\" cast \\"contempt\\" upon \\"any flag of the United States by publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling upon it.\\" The law defined flag in an expansive manner similar to most States. *1969 - July 20 ‚Äì Astronauts Neil Armstrong with Edwin \\"Buzz\\" Aldrin of Apollo 11 places the American flag on the Moon at \\"Tranquillity Base\\". *1969 - Street v. New York (394 U.S. 576) ‚Äì The Supreme Court held that New York State could not convict a person based on his verbal remarks disparaging the flag. Street was arrested after he learned of the shooting of civil rights leader James Meredith and reacted by burning his own flag and exclaiming to a small crowd that if the government could allow Meredith to be killed, \\"we don't need no damn flag.\\" The Court avoided deciding whether flag burning was protected by the First Amendment, and instead overturned the conviction based on Street's oral remarks. In Street, the Court found there was not a sufficient governmental interest to warrant regulating verbal criticism of the flag. *1972 - Smith v. Goguen (415 U.S. 94) ‚Äì The Supreme Court held that Massachusetts could not prosecute a person for wearing a small cloth replica of the flag on the seat of his pants based on a state law making it a crime to publicly treat the flag of the United States with \\"contempt\\". The Massachusetts statute was held to be unconstitutionally \\"void for vagueness.\\" *1974 - Spence v. Washington (418 U.S. 405) ‚Äì The Supreme Court held that the State of Washington could not convict a person for attaching removable tape in the form of a peace sign to a flag. The defendant had attached the tape to his flag and draped it outside of his window in protest of the 1970 U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State killings. The Court again found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment. *1970‚Äì1980 - Revision of State Flag Desecration Statutes ‚Äì During this period legislatures in some 20 states narrowed the scope of their flag desecration laws in an effort to conform to perceived Constitutional restrictions under the Street, Smith, and Spence cases and to more generally parallel the Federal Law (i.e., focusing more specifically on mutilation and other forms of physical desecration, rather than verbal abuse or commercial or political misuse). *1989 - Texas v. Johnson (491 U.S. 397) ‚Äì The Supreme Court upheld the Texas Court of Criminal appeals finding that Texas law ‚Äì making it a crime to \\"desecrate\\" or otherwise \\"mistreat\\" the flag in a way the \\"actor knows will seriously offend one or more persons\\" ‚Äì was unconstitutional as applied. This was the first time the Supreme Court had directly considered the applicability of the First Amendment to flag burning. Gregory Johnson, a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, was arrested during a demonstration outside of the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas after he set fire to a flag while protesters chanted \\"America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.\\" In a 5‚Äì4 decision authored by Justice William Brennan, the Court first found that burning the flag was a form of symbolic speech subject to protection under the First Amendment. The Court also determined that under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), since the State law was related to the suppression of freedom of expression, the conviction could only be upheld if Texas could demonstrate a \\"compelling\\" interest in its law. The Court next found that Texas' asserted interest in \\"protecting the peace\\" was not implicated under the facts of the case. Finally, while the Court acknowledged that Texas had a legitimate interest in preserving the flag as a \\"symbol of national unity\\", this interest was not sufficiently compelling to justify a \\"content based\\" legal restriction (i.e., the law was not based on protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, but was designed to protect it from symbolic protest likely to cause offense to others). *1989 - Revision of Federal Flag Desecration Statute ‚Äì Pursuant to the Flag Protection Act of 1989, Congress amended the 1968 federal flag desecration statute in an effort to make it \\"content neutral\\" and conform to the Constitutional requirements of the Johnson case. As a result, the 1989 Act sought to prohibit flag desecration under all circumstances by deleting the statutory requirement that the conduct cast contempt upon the flag and narrowing the definition of the term \\"flag\\" so that its meaning was not based on the observation of third parties. *1990 - United States v. Eichman (496 U.S. 310) ‚Äì Passage of the Flag Protection Act of 1989 resulted in a number of flag burning incidents protesting the new law. The Supreme Court overturned several flag burning convictions brought under the Flag Protection Act. The Court held that notwithstanding Congress' effort to adopt a more content neutral law, the federal law continued to be principally aimed at limiting symbolic speech. *1990 - Rejection of Constitutional Amendment ‚Äì Following the Eichman decision, Congress considered and rejected a Constitutional amendment specifying that \\"the Congress and the States have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\\" The amendment failed to muster the necessary two-thirds Congressional majorities, as it was supported by only a 254‚Äì177 margin in the House (290 votes were necessary) and a 58‚Äì42 margin in the Senate (67 votes were necessary). *1995 - The Flag Desecration Constitutional Amendment is narrowly defeated in the U.S. Senate. The Amendment to the Constitution would make burning the flag a punishable crime. *2005 - U.S. House of Representatives passes a new flag desecration constitutional amendment *2006 - U.S. Senate rejects new constitutional amendment *2007 - The longevity in years used of the present 50-star flag is now tied with that of the 48-star flag, both having experienced 47 years of continuous use. After this date, the 50-star flag became the longest-used version of the Flag of the United States of America.

Use as a road For much of its length it is a designated road under Queensland government legislation. The beach provides a convenient access way to Rainbow Beach and Fraser Island for many 4WD enthusiasts. It is also a much sought-after destination in itself for those seeking a bush camping experience on the beach. Fees apply for camping. The Noosa North Shore area is not open to vehicular traffic. The use of the beach by 4WD enthusiasts is a contentious issue. Many environmentalists see the 4WD car as a factor in the degradation of beach eco-systems. Others see it as their only means of experiencing a wilderness area and good fishing. As the beach is currently quite heavily used during holiday periods, fast moving vehicles can endanger those using the beach for recreation. Although the Queensland Government introduced vehicle access fees for use of the beach by vehicles, road safety issues remain a major concern. Cherry Venture The Singapore-registered cargo ship Cherry Venture ran aground here on 8 July 1973. It has been some time now since one could see the wreck on the beach. Its rusting hulk was removed in 2007 as being too dangerous to the many tourists who loved to climb through it against all warnings. The stainless steel propeller rests at Rainbow Beach as a monument.  Teewah Coloured Sands  The Teewah Coloured Sands are a stretch of sand cliffs along Teewah Beach within Noosa North Shore (). The cliffs are up to 200 metres in height and the sand is in a range of colours, created through natural combinations of iron oxide and vegetable dyes.

During the 12th Century different branches in Florence, Terni, Lucca, Pistoia and Pescia developed. Other famous branches of this family were established in Jesi, Palermo, Milan and Bologna. Members of this family have held different titles since the Middle Ages, among them: Lords of Jesi, Princes of Musone, marquis, Barons in the kingdom of Naples and Rome, counts in the kingdom of Italy and Bologna, senators and Consuls of Rome and the Kingdom of Italy.Dizionario Storico-Blasonico V.

Origin of the family Theudelinda in a fresco by Zavattari. Theudelinda was the sister of Aripert I. According to Eugenio Gamurrini and Ludovico Jacobilli the Simonetti from Terni, Milan, Florence, Jesi, Lucca, Osimo, Cingoli, had a single origin. Gamurrini linked the Florentine branch of the family to medieval Lucca but could not find the common ancestor that linked the Simonetti from Tuscany to the Simonetti from Jesi. He pointed to other facts that indicated the connection and the earlier research done by Jacobilli. According to Jacobilli the Simonetti branches were all descendants of a single line of Lombard barons that held fiefs in central Italy.Jacobilli, Ludovico Bibliotheca Umbriae Gamurrini in his Istoria genealogica delle famiglie nobili Toscane et Umbre studied manuscripts that linked the Simonetti of Milan, Lucca and Florence to Teuprando, a Lombard lord living in Lucca and a descendant of Aripert I, King of the Lombards (see Bavarian Dynasty). Other noble families from Lucca also recognized Teuprando as their ancestor, including the Rolandinghi, Soffredinghi, and Opezinghi. All these families held control of vast areas in the Garfagnana region and held castles around the Lombard city of Barga.Eugenio Gamurrini, Istoria genealogica delle famiglie nobili Toscane et Umbre (Firenze 1671) see Simonetti di Terni Other historians such as Lord Vernon were more conservative in their studies and researched documentation up to the beginning of the 13th century, still older documentation survived including documents related to Ranerio Simonecti (Raniero Simonetti), a wealthy nobleman who was alive in 1188La Carte della Propositura di S. Stefano di Prato - INSTRUMENTUM LAUDI 1188 giugno 27, Firenze pg 437 and who was also mentioned by E. Gamurrini. Vernon also studied the family's lordship of parts of the Val d‚Äô Elsa and the castle of Colle.U.Bosco - Encyclopedia Dantesca - see Sannella p. 6 and p. 7 According to Villani the family was forced to renounce all its titles in Florence and was reduced to popolani (common citizens) for a short time. The same happened in Lucca, by the beginning of the 15th century they had temporarily lost all prerogatives of nobility in Lucca and Florence, however were still recognized as patricians. Dore. Dante mentions the family by della Sannella, one of the ancient names of the family. Dante placed the Simonetti family in Paradiso XVI, among the ancient noble families of Florence and Cacciaguida. In Canto XVI of Paradiso, Dante says: > Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing > What I shall say of the great Florentines > Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past. > > I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini, > Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi, > Even in their fall illustrious citizens; > > And saw, as mighty as they ancient were, > With him of La Sannella, him of Arca, > And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.Wikisource: The Divine > Comedy/Paradiso/Canto XVI > Simonetti of Lucca The Lucca branch of the family became private bankers to Edward I of England and the Pope. The family was also one of the three major banking family dynasties controlling the Riccardi Banks of Lucca. In the year 1308 the Simonetti, Quartigiani and other noble families were banned from holding public offices in Lucca. In 1317 the Quartigiani clan regained power and placed Castruccio Castracani in the office of captain-general of the Republic. After a few months in office Castruccio Castracani turned against his protectors and plotted against the Quartigiani clan, including the Simonetti branch of the family. Many members of the family were killed by Castruccio Castracani and the Simonetti family was banned from Lucca for the second time in a period of a few years. The Simonetti family returned to Lucca after the death of Castracani. Francisco Simonetti dei Quartigiani was pro Florence and influenced in the acquisition of Lucca by Florence in 1341. The Quartigiani and Simonetti were banned from holding office in Lucca for a third time after the reestablishment of the Republic in 1370. The palace and tower of the Simonetti and Quartigiani families were located in the center of Lucca, today called Quartigiani Tower or Torre delle ore (Clock Tower). Simonetti of Jesi Detail of the painting Madonna del Rosario by Lorenzo Lotto. The lady in the painting is according to local tradition Sperandia Simonetti, a noblewoman from Cingoli.Government of the Marche, website accessed on June 04, 2010. Regione Marche The Simonetti first arrived in Jesi in the 12th century. According to Gamurrini, they were sent by emperor Barbarossa to govern Jesi as vicars. The first member of this family to appear in a document from Jesi was Raniero son of Capthio in 1201. Raniero was elected podest√† of Jesi in 1216.Note: According to Crollalanza of the Italian Academy of Heraldry the office of podesta was at this time only available to members of the ancient nobility He had four sons, named: Simonetto, Capthio, Gualtiero and Bartolo. The last three became lords of the castle of Castriccione around Cingoli. Bartolo later joined the Sylvestrines and became leader of the order. Simonetto was elected podest√† of Cerlongo and was the ambassador of Jesi to the government of the Marche. Simonetto had seven sons; among them were Mercenario Simonetti, a famous condottiero, Muzzolo and Oddone Simonetti, the last two became Lords of Donazzano. By 1286 the family was very powerful. As a result, they attracted the attention of the Pope and other lords. They were at this time Lords of Castriccione, the castle of Sasso, near Serra San Quirico, the castle of Santa Maria Nuova and other possessions in the Marche. Some members of the family joined the ghibellines during the 13th century and caused a struggle with Rome. The guelphs took Jesi and confiscated the property of the Simonetti and expelled the family from Jesi. In 1298 Rinaldo Simonetti signed a treaty with other nobles swearing allegiance to pope Boniface VIII. Walls of Jesi built in the 13th century. After struggles with the Malatesta family, Tano di Baligano, and Rome, the family returned to Jesi in the 14th century where Filippo Simonetti and Lomo Simonetti were De facto Lords of Jesi. The Church later recognized the lordship of Jesi by the Simonetti and declared the family vicars of the Holy See. The lordship was confirmed a second time by Pope Boniface IX in a papal bull from May 6, 1397. The family was banished from Jesi for a second time in the 15th century.Crollalanza, Cav. G.B. - Giornale Araldico Genealogico Diplomatica dell' ACCADEMIA ARALDICA ITALIANA, Pisa 1877 From this branch of the Simonetti originated the Simonetti from Osimo, Ancona and Cingoli. Some members of the Simonetti of Jesi migrated to Calabria, a famous member of this branch was Cicco Simonetta, secretary of Francesco Sforza.Annuario della nobilt√† italiana 1881 Available online - Google books According to Crollalanza the name was modified to Simonetta in Calabria. =Princes of Musone= In a papal bull of August 9, 1805 Pope Pius VII created the title of Prince of Musone for Count Don Raniero Simonetti from Ancona and his descendants. From this branch was also Cardinal Raniero Simonetti, governor of Rome in the 18th century.

At the same time, however, any large storm could potentially cause large numbers of mines to suddenly resurface. To recover them all would thus require mass excavation of the entire beach area with armored digging equipment, a task that would be expensive, dangerous, unlikely to definitively succeed, and certain to do severe damage to the \\"internationally important\\" Magellanic penguin rookeries.field survey report, Cranfield University, 9 July 2007. pg. 44, 101.

Wayang Golek is very popular in West Java, especially in the Pasundan land area. Today, wayang golek has become an important part of Sundanese culture in West Java.  History  According to some sources, the history of the Wayang Golek began in the 17th century. Initially, the Wayang Golek art emerged and was born in the north coast of the island of Java especially in Cirebon, the Wayang Golek used is the Wayang Golek Cepak in the form of a papak or flat head. According to legend, Sunan Suci used this Wayang Golek to spread of Islam in the community. At that time, the Wayang Golek performance still used Javanese in its dialogue. The Wayang Golek art began to develop in West Java during the expansion of the mataram sultanate. Wayang Golek began to develop with Sundanese as a dialogue. In addition to being a medium for spreading religion, Wayang Golek serves to complement thanksgiving or ruwatan events. At that time the puppet show was still without using sindhen as an accompanist. Wayang Golek began using the accompaniment of sinden in the 1920s. Until now the Wayang Golek continues to develop as entertainment for the community, especially in Sundanese land. Cepot, a Sundanese Punokawan, in wayang golek form In this Wayang Golek show, as with other wayang shows, plays and stories are played by a puppeteer. The difference is the language in the dialogue that is brought is Sundanese language. The standard and the wayang Golek are also the same as wayang kulit, for example in the Ramayana and Mahabarata stories. But the difference is in the character of the clown, the naming and form of the clown have their own version, namely the Sundanese version. In addition to the Ramayana and mahabarata stories, there are also stories and carangan stories. In this wayangan story, the mastermind makes his own story line which is usually taken from folklore or daily life. in the story carangan usually contains moral messages, criticism, humor and others - others. In the story carangan is not only used to develop the story, but also to measure the quality of the mastermind in making the story. In this puppet show besides accompanied by sinden also accompanied by Sundanese gamelan such as saron, peking, celery, bonang, kenong, gong, rebab, kempul xylophone, drums and culant drums. In its development, Wayang Golek remains one of the traditional arts of the pride of the people of West Java. Proven Wayang Golek still colors various events such as ruwatan, thanksgiving and other large events. In addition, some artists continue to develop it with a number of additional creations to make it look attractive and stay sustainable without eliminating the grip in it.

The letter purports to have been written to Dionysius the Younger, the tyrant of Syracuse who was introduced to Plato by his uncle Dion in the hopes of turning him to philosophy. It complains of Dionysius' ingratitude for having rudely dismissed Plato after having received such great service from him in the administration of his government and returns the sum which he had provided for travelling expenses as insultingly insufficient. The letter concludes with a number of quotations from tragic poets suggesting that Dionysius will die alone and friendless.

It states that if the perianal skin opening is posterior to the transverse anal line, the fistulous tract will open into the anal canal in the midline posteriorly, sometimes taking a curvilinear course. A perianal skin opening anterior to the transverse anal line is usually associated with a radial fistulous tract. Or in more direct terms, it means that anterior-opening fistulas tend to follow a simple, direct course while posterior-opening fistulas may follow a devious, curving path with some even being horseshoe-shaped before opening in the posterior midline.Burgess BE. Chapter 88. Anorectal Disorders. In: Tintinalli JE, Stapczynski JS, Cline DM, Ma OJ, Cydulka RK, Meckler GD, eds. Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York: McGraw- Hill; 2011. http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=6361536. Accessed June 14, 2012. Fistulas can be described as anterior or posterior relating to a line drawn in the coronal plane across the anus, the so-called transverse anal line. Anterior fistulas will have a direct track into the anal canal. Posterior fistulas will have a curved track with their external opening lying in the posterior midline of the anal canal. An exception to the rule are anterior fistulas lying more than 3.75 cm from the anus, which may have a curved track (similar to posterior fistulas) that opens into the posterior midline of the anal canal. Goodsall's rule may not be applicable when the fistula is more than 3.75 cm from the anal verge. In such situations, the fistula is almost always indirect. In situations where there are multiple anal fistulae, the course would be similar to that of posterior-opening fistulae because of branching and communication between these openings. The investigation of choice for anal fistulas is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fistulograms can be used to demonstrate the track of the fistula. Goodsall's rule is named after David Henry Goodsall who described it in 1900.

He is very tall and muscular, has an outstanding I.Q., is a sexual addict and sometimes feels entitled to break the law in order to right wrongs. Hopkins can't stand music or other loud noises, and frequently goes for days without sleep while working a hot case. In an October 13, 2017 interview, actor Tom Hanks stated that he would be interested in playing Lloyd Hopkins if a film or stage adaptation was to be produced.http://nyti.ms/2g9oN3i Other characters involved in the novels include: *Janice Marie Rice Hopkins, Lloyd's wife *Annie, Caroline and Penny, Lloyd and Janice's three daughters *Arthur \\"Dutch\\" Peltz, an older colleague of Lloyd's and his best friend *LAPD Captain Fred Gaffaney, a born again Christian and an enemy of Hopkins Themes In Blood on the Moon and Because the Night, Lloyd Hopkins clears up murders committed by exceptionally intelligent and organised criminals. The villains in Suicide Hill are much more trivial. The novels revolve around an underlying identification between Hopkins and the murderers. Conversely, because of his own infringements, Hopkins can never solve his cases and have the villains punished lawfully. Completing his investigations also involves confronting and defeating Fred Gaffaney, who wants Hopkins out of the LAPD for his wayward ways. Thematically, all this means that Hopkins can never obtain professional reward or personal recognition for his accomplishments. From a narrative point of view, it means that the line between main plot and subplot is blurred. Another aim for Hopkins in the novels is to save his marriage. Of his three daughters, he has a special relationship with Penny.

San Carlos Water is a bay/fjord on the west coast of East Falkland, facing onto the Falkland Sound.

The settlements of San Carlos and Port San Carlos on the Water, as well as San Carlos River, all take their names from the ship San Carlos, which visited in 1768.  Description  San Carlos Water is a fjord-like inlet at an angle of 45¬∞ to the Falkland Sound coastline, thereby offering shelter from the weather in the Sound (which is itself sheltered from the South Atlantic by bluffs in the north and an archipelago in the south). The inlet is 9.3 miles (15 km) in length and for about half of its length, is about 1.2 miles (2 km) wide. It is flat-bottomed with a depth of between ; the 20 m isobath lying about 660 feet (200 m) offshore. The tidal range at Port San Carlos varies between (for neap and spring tides respectively) with low water being between above the chart datum.

The Treaty called for the creation of a League of Nations in which the promise of mutual security would hopefully prevent another major world war; the League charter, primarily written by President Woodrow Wilson, let the League set the terms for war and peace. If the League called for military action, all members would have to join in. Lodge wanted to join the League of Nations with reservations. The Democrats in the Senate, following Wilson's direction, rejected Lodge's proposal to join the League with his reservations. Republicans opposed joining under Wilson's terms of no reservations, allowing the League to force the U.S. to enter a war without approval of Congress. In the end the Senate voted down the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and never joined the new League of Nations.David Mervin, \\"Henry Cabot Lodge and the League of Nations.\\" Journal of American Studies 4#2 (1971): 201-214. Lodge's reservations were eventually incorporated into the United Nations in 1945, where the U.S. had a veto.Leo Gross, \\"The Charter of the United Nations and the Lodge Reservations.\\" American Journal of International Law 41.3 (1947): 531-554. in JSTOR The Lodge Reservations Lodge's reservations proposed to give much power back to the United States in its interactions with other nations. A summary of each reservation follows: =Reservation One= Article 1 of the Treaty of Versailles permitted any member state voluntarily to withdraw from the League of Nations \\"provided that all its international obligations and all its obligations under this Covenant shall have been fulfilled.\\" Lodge's first reservation clarified that the League could not use this clause to prevent a member state from withdrawing ‚Äî at least, not when that member state was the United States. A concurrent resolution of Congress requires the consent of both houses of Congress, but, significantly, does not require the consent of the President. =Reservation Two= Nothing compels the United States to ensure the border integrity or political independence of any nation, to interfere in foreign domestic disputes, or to involve the military, without a Congressional declaration of war. =Reservation Three= Article 22 of the Treaty of Versailles dealt with the creation and administration of League of Nations mandates. Lodge's third reservation proposed that Congress should be able to reject administering, developing, or defending any territorial mandate that the League might try to assign to it. =Reservation Four= =Reservation Five= The United States is not to be questioned about the Monroe Doctrine, or about its interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. =Reservation Six= Articles 156‚Äì158 of the Treaty of Versailles transferred Germany's concessions on the Shandong Peninsula from Germany to Japan. Under Article 10 of the treaty, signatories would have been responsible for preserving Japan's new border ‚Äî effectively taking Japan's side in the event of a subsequent war between Japan and China. =Reservation Seven= Congress alone shall approve the United States' delegates to the League of Nations. Should no delegate ever be appointed, authorization to deal with the League is explicitly denied to any other person (significantly, even to the President). A contemporary analyst observed: \\"As this is a matter left to each government to determine for itself, there seems no adequate reason for incorporating such a reservation in the ratification act.\\" =Reservation Eight= Trade between Germany and the United States can only be interfered with approval from Congress. =Reservation Nine= The United States is not obligated to pay any money to the League of Nations. =Reservation Ten= If the United States limits its military might because of an order by the League of Nations, it can, at any time and without warning, build it up again if threatened. =Reservation Eleven= The United States reserves the right to allow peoples of states which break the Treaty of Versailles who live in the United States to continue their lives in the United States. =Reservation Twelve= =Reservation Thirteen= If the League of Nations is to create any future organizations, the United States is not bound to join so no matter as to how the League of Nations wishes concerning their involvement. Instead, Congress has the right to make the decision as to whether or not the United States chooses to be involved and the terms of their involvement. =Reservation Fourteen= The United States will not be bound by any vote in the League of Nations in which a nation has voted twice, through the use of colonial possessions. Neither will it be bound by a vote which concerns a dispute between the United States and another member state, if that state has voted. This reservation was specifically intended to deal with the voting power of Dominions of the British Empire in the Assembly of the League of Nations. Henry Cabot Lodge and Republicanism The Treaty of Versailles posed ideological problems for many Republicans, including Henry Cabot Lodge. Most contentious of its propositions was the Covenant that called for the creation of a League of 46 nations to arbitrate international law and maintain peace for the indefinite future. The contents of Article 10 specifically required that the United States Congress relinquish its authority over whether the United States commits itself to warfare. Lodge even recorded his personal position on August 11, 1919: > if there had been no proposition such as is included in Article 10, but a > simple proposition that it would be our intention to aid France, which is > our barrier and outpost, when attacked without provocation by Germany, I > should have strongly favored it for I feel very keenly the sacrifices of > France and the immense value her gallant defense was to the whole world. But > they have made the French treaty subject to the authority of the League, > which is not to be tolerated. If we ever are called upon to go to the > assistance of France as we were two years ago, we will go without asking > anybody's leave. It is humiliating to be put in such an attitude and not the > least of the mischief done by the League is that Article 10 will probably > make it impossible to do anything for France as Root recommends and as many > of our Senators desire. Lodge, in fact, favored many of the clauses of the Treaty and similar proposals by League supporters. It could be said that Lodge's beliefs resembled the features of the peace program of French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, by voicing admiration for the said program in his memorandum. The underpinnings of Lodge's acceptance of the peace program and reservations to the Treaty of Versailles highlight Wilson's opportunity to compromise with a senator who shared similar, if not identical, ideals. (memorandum, [Dec. 2, 1918,] Henry Cabot Lodge Papers (Massachusetts Historical Society); Congressional Record, 65 cong., 3 Sess., 724-28 (Dec. 21, 1918).) One of the ideals was the control of military states, especially in reaction to Germany. During negotiations with diplomat Henry White over the impending peace settlement, Lodge emphasized that \\"the first and controlling purpose of the peace must be to put Germany in such a position that it will be physically impossible for her to break out again upon other nations with a war for world conquest.\\" As was then common among political leaders, Lodge believed that Germany should pay the maximum indemnity which it could afford. Moreover, he believed that postwar matters must not be muddled by an indefinite covenant, a belief that contrasted with some previous statements that Lodge had made, such as his commencement address at Union College, Schenectady, New York, on June 9, 1915, in which he said that \\"in differences between nations which go beyond the limited range of arbititrable questions peace can only be maintained by putting behind it the force of united nations determined to uphold it and prevent war.\\" Statements like those imply possible inconsistency within Lodge's views, but many interpret Lodge, especially considering his correspondences, as a nationalist who simply disfavored aspects of the Covenant. In correspondence to Lodge, Senators Knox and Root sent a letter that explained the distinction between the League and an alliance. The three senators shared an aversion to the commitments of Article 10 as they generally accepted that it would impel the US into the enforcement of all international law. Lodge and future President Calvin Coolidge also exchanged over 400 letters from 1888 to 1924, the bulk of which centered on the 1919‚Äì1920 conflict over the League of Nations. The letters document twenty years of Lodge's expansionism and nationalism‚Äîespecially in his opinions U.S. foreign policy in Latin America during the administrations of Taft and Wilson, which thus question claims that Lodge was strictly an isolationist. Defeat of the treaty by senatorial debate On September 16, 1919, Senator Lodge called the treaty up for consideration by the full Senate. On November 15, the chamber was still considering the treaty when for the first time in its history, the Senate successfully voted to invoke cloture, cutting off debate on the treaty. Four days later, the Senate voted on Lodge's resolution to advise and consent to ratification subject to the reservations. The vote was 39 in favor and 55 opposed. A two-thirds vote being required, the resolution failed. The senators who favored ratification of the treaty without reservations had joined with the \\"irreconcilables,\\" those who opposed the treaty under any circumstances, to defeat the reservations. The Senate then considered a resolution to advise and consent to ratification of the treaty without reservations. The vote was 38 in favor and 53 opposed. A two-thirds vote being required, the resolution failed. The final blow occurred on March 19, 1920, when the treaty with reservations was again defeated, 49 in favor to 35 against. Many historians attribute the treaty's failure to Wilson's diminished health at the time of the defeat and to his total unwillingness to compromise. On October 2, 1919, Wilson suffered a massive stroke that affected the left side of his body. He gradually recovered from this stroke, but took its toll on his health. Thomas A. Bailey wrote that \\"Wilson's physical and mental condition had a profoundly important bearing on the final defeat of the treaty.\\" Several prominent thinkers believed that if Wilson had been functioning at his pre-stroke level, he would have been able to bridge the discrepancies between the two forms of Reservations on the treaty. Wilson's doctor, Edwin A. Weinstein, felt that \\"had Wilson been in full health, he would have found the formula to reconcile the differences between the Lodge and Hitchcock Reservations.\\" (Arthur Link) His illness affected him in that it incapacitated part of his left side. After the stroke, Wilson would distance himself from his paralyzed arm by referring to the arm as \\"it\\". His stroke also seemed to polarize his emotions (Arthur Link), causing him to become even more stubborn when dealing with the reservations.John Milton Cooper, Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations (Cambridge UP, 2001). Another factor in the defeat of the treaty was Wilson's staunch belief that the people supported him. He refused to compromise and so, according to Bailey, betrayed the League. Wilson's refusal led him to formulate his \\"Jackson Day\\" letter in which he calamitously made the treaty an issue of the upcoming 1920 presidential election. The letter sealed the fate of the treaty by converting a nonpartisan issue into a hostage of party loyalty and politics.Thomas A. Bailey, Woodrow Wilson and the great betrayal (1945).

Biography  Prince Albert Victor, 1875 Photograph of Queen Victoria, 1882 Alessandro Bassano was the second youngest child of Italian Clemente Bassano, originally a fishmonger of Cranbourne Street, later an oilman and warehouseman of Jermyn Street, London, and his English wife, Elizabeth Browne. He later anglicised his first name to Alexander. Bassano received early artistic training with artists Augustus Egg and William Beverley. He opened his first studio in 1850 in Regent Street. The studio then moved to Piccadilly 1859‚Äì1863, to Pall Mall and then to 25 Old Bond Street in 1877. There was also a Bassano branch studio at 132 King's Road, Brighton from 1893 to 1899. The Old Bond Street studio was decorated with carbon photographic prints and plaster busts, and was large enough to accommodate an 80-foot panoramic background scene mounted on rollers, which provided a variety of outdoor scenes or court backgrounds. He had taken portraits of William Ewart Gladstone and even monarchs such as Queen Victoria and Cetshwayo kaMpande. Bassano's head of Lord Kitchener formed the basis of the First World war recruiting poster Your Country Needs You. Bassano retired from work at the studio around 1903, when the premises were extensively refurbished and relaunched as \\"Bassano Ltd, Royal Photographers\\". The studio moved once again in 1921: a move written about by the Lady's Pictorial at the time. The article described about a million negatives, all systematically numbered, which had to be moved from the cellars of the premises to the new location at 38 Dover Street. The company became \\"Bassano and Vandyk\\" in 1964. The following year it incorporated Elliott & Fry, a photographic partnership that had been running in Baker Street since 1863. In 1977, the company became \\"Industrial Photographic\\", based at 35 Moreton Street, SW1. Over 40,000 negatives from the Bassano Studios, including some by Alexander Bassano, are held in the National Portrait Gallery, London. The Museum of London holds a large number of the fashion-related plates. The National Portrait Gallery held an exhibit of his work, Alexander Bassano: Victorian Photographer in 2013, the centenary of his death. Personal life  He married Adelaide Rose Ainslie Lancaster (1825-1906) in 1850. They had a son, Clement George Alexander (1853-1899), and two daughters, Adelaide Fanny Louise (1850-1921) and Camilla Teresa ('Lily') (1859-1928). Portraits of his wife and children are held in the National Portrait Gallery, London. His sister Louisa Bassano was a noted singer and teacher.

It lies at the end of a narrow peninsula, which protects Volunteer Lagoon. It received its name in 1815, when the sealing ship Volunteer left a boat's crew there to collect seal skins while it went in search of opportunities elsewhere. Four years later, on 13 February 1820, the French research vessel L'Uranie struck a submerged rock just off the point but stayed afloat long enough to be beached in Berkeley Sound. All on board survived, including the Captain's wife, Rose de Freycinet, who recorded the incident in her diary. Volunteer Shanty, a well maintained outhouse that was used by trekkers until a few years ago, is situated at the landward end of the point. Strategic value in Falklands War Volunteer Point is one of the easternmost points of the islands, but Cape Pembroke is the furthest east. During the Falklands War, Argentine commanders considered it a potential British landing point, because it was far from continental Argentine airbases (e.g. Rio Grande, Comodoro Rivadavia), and those at Pebble Island, but also a strategic foothold for any British force wishing to retake Stanley.Bicheno, Hugh (2006) Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War.

She started making and selling paintings, participated in University of Arizona's Southwest Indian Art Project and was featured in Seventeen magazine, all before she was 18 years of age. Creating art was a means of spiritual expression that developed from her Roman Catholic upbringing and Native American heritage. She created contemporary works of art with geometric patterns based upon Native American symbols and motifs, like corn, katsinas, and chiefs. In 1976 she was featured in the PBS American Indian artists series. Early life and education Helen Hardin was born on May 28, 1943 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the daughter of Pablita Velarde, Santa Clara Pueblo artist, and Herbert Hardin, a European-American former police officer and Chief of Public Safety. Hardin's first language was Tewa.Mary Stokrocki, \\"Helen Hardin,\\" School Arts, April 1995. Accessed via Questia Online Library, which is a subscription required source.

Hardin was raised by her artistic mother and her family at the Santa Clara Pueblo and she went to school and lived among the Anglo world for much of her life. She saw herself as \\"Anglo socially and Indian in [her] art.\\"Gretchen M. Bataille and Laurie Lisa, eds., Native American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, 2nd ed. New York: Routledge, 2001, 124. Accessed via Questia, which is a subscription required source. At six years of age Hardin won first prize for a drawing. Her works were sold when she was nine with her mother's at Gallup ceremonial events. Although she was influenced by her mother's techniques and works, Hardin wanted to create her own style. Her relationship with her mother became increasingly difficult as Hardin became more artistic and as a consequence of her parents' divorce in 1957 or 1959.Liz Sonneborn. A to Z of American Indian Women. Infobase Publishing; 1 January 2007. . pp. 83-84. She studied drafting at Albuquerque's St. Pius X High School, a parochial Catholic school. In the summer of 1960 Hardin attended the University of Arizona's Southwest Indian Art Project, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Also while in high school she was featured in Seventeen magazine. In 1961 and 1962 she attended the University of New Mexico, where she studied architecture and art, although her mother wanted her to study business. Her mother also said she didn't like her paintings. Hardin considered her own work to be non- traditional, yet she was influenced by native pictographs, petroglyphs and pottery designs and the works of her teacher Joe Herrera, who was a Cubist from the Cochiti Pueblo. Hardin's relationship with her high school boyfriend, Pat Terrazas, continued after graduation and they had a daughter, Margarete Bagshaw, in 1964. Hardin had to sneak opportunities to paint because both her boyfriend and her mother disapproved She went to Bogot√°, Colombia in 1968 as a respite from the abusive relationship with Terrazas and an unhealthy relationship with her mother. She said of that time, \\"I awoke to the fact that I was twenty-four years old, I was locked into an unhappy [relationship], and I was not painting. I didn't know who I was or what I was. In search of personal freedom, I took Margarete... and left the country.\\" Art Helen Hardin, The Woman Series: Changing Woman, Medicine Woman, and Listening Woman, 1981-1984 She was a studio artist, who from the 1960s to mid 1970s lectured and exhibited paintings at Albuquerque's Enchanted Mesa Gallery. Hardin's early artistic works were characterized as traditionally realistic and she signed them with her Tewa name, Tsa-Sah-Wee-Eh. She was influenced by her spirituality and the protective, supportive \\"angels\\" in her life. Up to 26 layers of paint - including ink washes, acrylics, airbrush and varnish - were applied to create her works; Hardin painted tiny dots called stipples; spattered paint with a toothbrush, like Anasazi pottery; and applied transparent washes. In 1964 Hardin made the painting Medicine Talk for her first major solo exhibition at Enchanted Mesa. While with her father in 1968 in Bogot√°, Colombia, she began painting in earnest and had a successful show at the American Embassy, where she sold 27 paintings. Since her reputation in the United States was tied with her mother's success, she had not been sure the degree to which she had success based upon her own merit. In Colombia her success was based on her talent alone. When she returned to United States, her art became more geometric and abstract, and she used deep colored paints. Hardin was said to have brought a \\"new look\\" to Native American art by New Mexico Magazine. The publicity was a turning point in her career, its publicity led to greater success and recognition. In 1971 she had a show in Guatemala City. As her career matured and she gained confidence, Hardin became known for painting complex works that combined colorful images and symbols from her Native American heritage with modern abstract art techniques. Her work frequently incorporated images of women, chiefs, kachinas and designs from pueblo pottery, and integrated modern elements as her career advanced. For instance, the paintings of kachinas and blanketed chiefs integrated geometric patterns made with drafting templates, rulers and protractors. Kachinas, or heavenly messengers, had special spiritual meaning, similar to the saints from her Catholic tradition, connecting between people on earth and heaven. She was filmed in 1976 for a series on American Indian artists for Public Broadcasting System (PBS). Other filmed artists included R. C. Gorman, Charles Loloma, Allan Houser, Joseph Lonewolf, and Fritz Scholder.Steven Leuthold, \\"13: Native American Art and Artists in Visual Arts Documentaries from 1973 to 1991,\\" in On the Margins of Art Worlds, ed.

Invergarry Castle in the Scottish Highlands was the seat of the Chiefs of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, a powerful branch of the Clan Donald. The castle's position overlooking Loch Oich on Creagan an Fhithich ‚Äì the Raven's Rock ‚Äì in the Great Glen, was a strategic one in the days of clan warfare. It is not certain when the first structure was erected on Creagan an Fhithich but there are at least two sites prior to the present castle. After raids by the Clan Mackenzie in 1602 which included the burning of Strome Castle, the MacDonalds of Glengarry fortified Creagan an Fhithich. The result was an imposing six storey L-plan tower house. According to clan tradition, the castle was built with stones passed hand to hand by a chain of clansmen from the mountain Ben Tee.Norman H. MacDonald. The Clan Ranald of Knoydart and Glengarry. Published by FSA Scot. Printed in Scotland by the Dryden Printing Company. 1979. The present structure was designed on the \\"L\\" plan, with a round tower at the north-east angle. The main building rose to five stories and the tower to six stories in height. The main building measured 55 by 32 ft. The hall, on the first floor, measured 44 by 20 feet. The main entrance was in the north wall of the wing of the castle. There are shot holes used to guard the main door and there are also shot holes under the staircases and in the walls of the tower.Norman H. MacDonald. The Clan Ranald of Knoydart and Glengarry.

During the Civil War Oliver Cromwell's troops under General Monck burned the castle down in 1654. Repaired, it was held for King James VII of Scotland from 1688 until its surrender to the Government forces of William and Mary in 1692. It was then held by the Jacobites during the 1715 uprising, but taken for the government in 1716. During the 1745 uprising it was again held by Jacobites and visited twice by Bonnie Prince Charlie. During the Jacobite risings of 1745 to 1746, Prince Charles Edward Stuart ‚Äì \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" ‚Äì visited the Castle shortly after the raising of the Royal Standard at Glenfinnan and is said to have rested there after his defeat at the Battle of Culloden, in 1746. In the aftermath of Culloden it was sacked and partially blown up by troops under Duke of Cumberland as part of his systematic suppression of the Highlands. However the stout walls refused to yield and have survived the centuries to serve as a reminder to their history. The Glengarry estates were sold by Aeneas Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, the son of Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry (1771‚Äì1828), when he came of age, but he retained Invergarry Castle, Invergarry House, the \\"Well of Heads\\" and the ancient clan burial ground, which instead passed through Aeneas's daughter to the Erskine Cuninghames of Balgownie and Corrie, transferred in 1960 to the National Trust for Scotland.Norman H.

It ran aground on Teewah Beach in South East Queensland, Australia on 6 July 1973 and remained on the beach for 34 years until its removal in early 2007.  History  The ship, originally named the Scania, was built in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1945. She was later called the Slott and Timor Venture. In 1973, she was owned by Sea Tankers Pty. Ltd. of Singapore and known as the Cherry Venture. Cause of the wreck On the day of the storm the ship was traveling from Auckland to Brisbane under the command of Captain Seluenu. Cherry Venture was wrecked due to a combination of severe storms and a lack of cargo. Buoys in the area recorded wave heights of up to . The unladen ship sat high in the water, which, when combined with the high tides and strong swell, propelled it to a point far enough up the sand that it could not be successfully re-floated, despite attempts that involved dredging the beach. However, the captain and the crew of 24 and 2 monkeys onboard all survived. Salvage attempts The wreck was subsequently purchased by Peter Vagellas, an Australian entrepreneur, who had intended to re-float the vessel and convert it into a luxury liner and floating casino to service the Great Barrier Reef. In 1977 there was a failed attempt to refloat the ship. Nine major salvage attempts over the years have failed. Public interest The wreck was a popular stopping point for tourists en route between Noosa and Fraser Island, and has been photographed often. Despite safety warnings regarding the rusting structure's unsound nature, visitors would often climb over the wreck. Removal Propeller, saved and displayed at Rainbow Beach, 2016 In December 1985, the ship's stainless steel propeller was removed using a thermal lance by Bill, Tony and Bruce Dunne of Caloundra. It was later restored by the Rainbow Beach Business and Tourism Association and then mounted as a monument in the township of Rainbow Beach. In late 2006 it was announced that the wreck would be demolished due to increasing dangers posed by its deterioration, including exposed asbestos in the engine room.A Fading Queensland icon is about to receive its last rites.Cherry Venture wreck to be removed from Teewah Beach The removal process, which necessitated cordoning off a section of public highway which runs along the beach next to the wreck, began on 13 February 2007. 2013 hull recovery After the demolition of the wreck in 2007, the state government ordered the site to be buried for the safety of visitors. In 2013, Cyclone Oswald and local storms caused severe erosion at the site which removed the layer of sand above the remains of the hull. This sparked the tourism business as the wreck was and now still is a special example of Australia's shipping history.

The phrase is a calque of the Chinese phrase \\"ÂìëÂ∑¥Ëã±ËØ≠\\" (y«ébƒÅ yƒ´ngy«î in pinyin). The phenomenon is sometimes referred to as Dumb English. Mute English occurs primarily due an emphasis on literacy, grammar, and correctness in language education. Efforts to mitigate Mute English in China have resulted in numerous commercial products including TEFL schools and teach-yourself courses, international exchanges, and the eagerness with which Chinese students strive to practice their English with foreign visitors. Though any language can have its form of mute speakers (e.g. Mute Polish), the phenomenon of 'Mute English' in China is a massive, acknowledged problem, one which the school systems and students are attempting to address. A related concept is the less-common Deaf English.

The phrase originated from the slang usage of the words \\"bang\\" which means \\"excitement\\" and \\"buck\\" which means \\"money\\". Variations of the term include \\"bang for your buck,\\" \\"bang for one's buck,\\" \\"more bang for the buck,\\" \\"bigger bang for the buck,\\" and mixings of these. \\"More bang for the buck\\" was preceded by \\"more bounce to the ounce\\", an advertising slogan used in 1950 to market the carbonated soft drink Pepsi. The phrase \\"bigger bang for the buck\\" was notably used by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Charles Erwin Wilson, in 1954. He used it to describe the New Look policy of depending on nuclear weapons, rather than a large regular army, to keep the Soviet Union in check. Today, the phrase is used to mean a greater worth for the money used. History and usage William Safire discussed \\"bang for the buck\\" in his 1968 book, New Language of Politics. Safire stated that U.S. Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson used the phrase in 1954 to summarize the New Look policy. The New Look, a 1950s national security policy during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was called \\"more bang for the buck\\" and \\"bigger bang for the buck\\". \\"More bang for the buck\\" was also used in the late 1960s by the U.S. military to refer to how it wanted to receive more combat power from the armaments it possessed. The United States, instead of supporting a large regular army, increasingly depended on nuclear weapons to hold the Soviet Union in check. \\"Bigger bang for the buck\\" is similar to the phrase \\"more bounce to the ounce\\", an advertising catchphrase used in 1950 by PepsiCo to market its soft drink product Pepsi. Sometimes the phrase is used to mean \\"a better value for the money spent\\". Criticism The word \\"bang\\" is slang for \\"sexual intercourse\\". Hence the phrase \\"bang for the buck\\" has the slang meaning of \\"sexual intercourse for money\\". As a result, the use of this phrase, including a variety of adjectives preceding the word bang, to supposedly describe a subsequent action, has been deemed extremely offensive by some. This interpretation led to a formal request made to the educational arm of a major IT corporation to not have any of their instructors use this phrase. In 2001, author Matthew L. Stone wrote that the phrase \\"has been overused almost to the point of becoming meaningless\\". In her 2010 book The Trouble with Thinking, Lauren Powers wrote that whenever she hears the clich√© \\"bigger bang for the buck\\", she becomes \\"distracted\\" by the phrase's history and cannot continue paying attention to the speaker's words.

Formed in 1996, Natiruts has released six studio albums and five live albums during a career spanning two decades. The group released its debut album Nativus in 1997 and increased in popularity through its 2009 album Ra√ßaman and the accompanying single \\"Sorri, Sou Rei\\". The group's 2012 album Ac√∫stico was nominated for Best Brazilian Contemporary Pop Album at the 2013 Latin Grammy Awards. History Natiruts formed in 1996 after a barbecue in lead vocalist Alexandre Carlo proposed the idea of popularizing reggae in Brazil. The band changed its name several times in its early stages, beginning with the name Nativus, which was already taken, then to Os Nativos, then to Natiruts Reggae Power Ao Vivo, which was later shortened to Natiruts. Having formed in Bras√≠lia, Natiruts deviated from the local rock scene in the city by singing about spirituality and environmentalism. Despite the band's perception that the city was not the \\"ideal environment\\" for tropical music in that it lacked beaches and other aspects associated with the genre, the group demonstrated strong reggae influences since its formation. The band's debut album, Nativus, was released in 1997. Despite gaining local popularity in its formative years, Natiruts' 2009 album Ra√ßaman, was viewed as the group's breakthrough album. In 2009, the band released the song \\"Sorri, Sou Rei\\", which became one of the group's signature songs. The group's 2012 album Ac√∫stico was nominated for Best Brazilian Contemporary Pop Album at the 2013 Latin Grammy Awards, but lost to M√∫sicas Para Churrasco Vol. 1 Ao Vivo by Seu Jorge.

Lead vocalist Alexandre Carlo participated in a virtual Mother's Day festival on May 10, 2020 during the COVID 19 pandemic.

Then from 2005 it went under general development as new houses and apartments, however the development plan was not completed. In 2018, after the previous unsuccess, the hall was bought by a local businessman, owner of Trojan Scaffolding and Trojan Skips (Trojan North East), Steven Parker, and has since been under constructional development.

Structures of the North East The grounds were laid out in the style of Capability Brown. Alterations were around 1818 by John Dobson. The hall and its surrounding was converted for use as the Newcastle Ragged School in 1920. It was initially an Industrial School amd then an Approved school. It had spaces for 153 children and closed in 1981. Having stood empty, neglected and deteriorating the property was acquired in 2005 by property developers, Eight Property Ltd, for restoration and conversion to residential apartments.

In his first clerical posting in Ireland, the lady of the manor falls in love with him, but he is seduced by her niece, whom he later marries. He becomes a musician and lives in poverty in Dublin, where his wife deserts him and later dies in Switzerland. After a period in Spain he is given a second chance and becomes a missionary to India, where he again risks becoming involved with a rich local woman but this time escapes.

The structure is best known today for evoking the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a condition caused by an ice floe in 1977. The first lighthouse was built on Sharps Island in 1838, but due to the island's erosion it was moved in 1848. This was replaced with a screwpile lighthouse in 1866 near the original location of the first structure. The second lighthouse lasted until 1881 when it was forced off its foundations by an ice floe. It floated nearly five miles down the Chesapeake‚Äîwith its keepers still inside‚Äîuntil it ran aground, allowing the men to escape unharmed. The current light, a sparkplug lighthouse, was constructed in 1882 with a concrete caisson foundation and a cast iron tower. The fourth-order Fresnel lens was replaced with a lens in 1977; the focal plane is above sea level. The tower includes an integral dwelling and was manned until 1938 when the United States Coast Guard automated the light. Leaning by about 15¬∞ since it was ice-damaged in 1977, the structure is picturesque, but in poor condition. The Sharps Island Light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (reference # 82002821) on July 22, 1982. It is one of the many historic features along Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail. It is also on the Lighthouse Digest Doomsday List of endangered lighthouses. As of 2006, the lighthouse was a candidate for sale under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act.National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. It was deactivated in January 2010.

Tie Vapauteen, (Finnish for \\"Road to Freedom\\"), was a Finnish language monthly magazine published by Finnish members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the United States from 1919 to 1937. The magazine advanced an explicitly syndicalist position marked by Marxian class analysis. The magazine featured regular analysis of American industry, working life, and political commentary alongside poetry, fiction, and humor. The publication was also closely tied to the Finnish Work People's College in Duluth, Minnesota, and would occasionally publish contributions written by Work Peoples' College students. Publication history =Establishment= Tie Vapauteen (Road to Freedom) first appeared in June 1919 as the publication of an entity called \\"Finnish IWW Supporters of the Eastern States,\\" under the supervision of the governing General Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the World.Auvo Kostiainen, \\"Tie Vapauteen,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 1: Migrants from Northern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 230 The magazine was published in New York City under the editorship of the Finnish immigrant Topias Kekkonen. The publication achieved a peak circulation of between 5,000 and 6,000 copies during this interval.Roy Brown, \\"High Spots of the 13th IWW Convention,\\" Industrial Pioneer, June 1921, pp. 50-56. =Move to Chicago= Beginning in February 1921, publication of Tie Vapauteen moved from New York to Chicago and the magazine was brought into the stable of periodicals produced by the IWW's official Publishing Bureau, operated through organizational headquarters. According to a report by business manager Rosa Knuuti to the 13th Convention of the IWW in June 1921, the move to Chicago was made in an effort to ameliorate editorial controversy between supporters of the Communist International and opponents of political action ‚Äî a bitter dispute which had caused the magazine's circulation to plummet to about 3,500, thereby threatening its existence. This bold shift of venue and increased attention to moderating the extremes of political opinion seems to have paid dividends, as within four months the publication's circulation had successfully rebounded to the 6,500 copy mark. By the end of 1924, a circulation of 8,000 copies per issue would be claimed.Solon DeLeon ad Nathan Fine (eds.), American Labor Press Directory. New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1925; pg. 12. Tie Vapauteen would remain an official organ of the IWW through March 1929. =Transfer to Duluth= In April 1929, Tie Vapauteen was transferred to a third publishing entity, the Workers' Socialist Publishing Company (WSPC) of Duluth, Minnesota. This radical Finnish publishing group had emerged from the syndicalist left wing of the old Finnish Socialist Federation and had for more than a decade published the pro-IWW newspaper Industrialisti (The Industrialist). The WSPC also was closely connected with Work People's College, located in the Smithville suburb of Duluth. Tie Vapauteen was rebranded as an \\"industrialist scientific-literary monthly\\" under the WSPC's supervision. Issues were profusely illustrated with photographs and cartoon art, and included poetry and fiction in addition to the expected hard-hitting political fare. Issues typically ran 32 pages in length. Each spring the students of Work People's College would edit a special annual called Ty√∂v√§en Opiston Kev√§tjulkaisu (The Spring Publication of Work People's College) as a special number of Tie Vapauteen.Kostiainen, \\"Tie Vapauteen,\\" pg. 231. A total of 19 volumes of Tie Vaupauteen were produced in all, with the publication terminating publication in August 1937. =Contributors= A number of prominent figures of the Finnish left wing movement made editorial contributions to Tie Vapauteen. Included among these were Kalle Rissanen, Yrj√∂ Sirola, and William Tanner, among others.

Text Interpretation Few consider the Tenth Letter to be authentic.Bury, Epistle X, 599; Hamilton and Cairns, Collected Dialogues, 1516. It purports to be a private letter of encouragement to an otherwise unknown Aristodorus, commending him for his continued support of Dion, presumably during the latter's exile from Syracuse in his struggle for power with his nephew, Dionysius the Younger. Why such a letter would be preserved is unknown. More damaging to the letter's authenticity is its rather un-Platonic claim that genuine philosophy, which Aristodorus supposedly exhibits to the highest degree, consists entirely of steadfastness, trustworthiness, and sincerity, apparently to the exclusion of any intellectual qualities or even of any particular love of learning: any wisdom or cleverness which tends toward other moral commitments is rightly called \\"ingenuity\\" or \\"daintiness\\" (Bury translates \\"parlour-tricks;\\" Post, \\"embellishments;\\" Œ∫ŒøŒºœàœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±œÇ).Bury, Epistle X, 599.

He was incorporated at Oxford on 13 July 1669.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Scadden-Sheyne Sharp was ordained deacon and priest on 12 August 1667, and until 1676 was chaplain and tutor in the family of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham at Kensington House. Meanwhile, he became archdeacon of Berkshire (1673), prebendary of Norwich, rector of St Giles in the Fields, and in 1681 Dean of Norwich. In 1686, when chaplain to James II, he was suspended for ten months on a charge of having made some reflections on the king, and in 1688 was cited for refusing to read the Declaration of Indulgence. He was described as a \\"vehement preacher\\" whose eyes \\"flamed remarkably\\". Under William III and Mary II he succeeded Tillotson as Dean of Canterbury in 1689, and (after declining a choice of sees vacated by non- jurors who were his personal friends) followed Thomas Lamplugh as Archbishop of York in 1691. He made a thorough investigation of the affairs of his see, and regulated the disordered chapter of Southwell. Advisor to Queen Anne He preached at the coronation of Queen Anne and became her Lord High Almoner and confidential adviser in matters of church and state, completely eclipsing Thomas Tenison, the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose Low Church views made him uncongenial to the Queen. Anne, as he records, said \\"that I would be her confessor, and she would be mine\\". His diary makes it clear that she often confided State business to him, and listened carefully to any arguments he made, even if she did not always follow his advice. His diary is a useful source for her reign, and contradicts the Memoirs of Sarah Churchill on a number of crucial points . Unlike Sarah, he maintains that the Queen was devastated by her husband's death (\\"we both wept\\"), and that her increasingly close friendship with Abigail Masham was not a secret (\\"talked with the Queen of Mrs. Masham, I find she has a true kindness for her\\"). Sarah Churchill, who prided herself on never dissembling her opinions, and eventually lost the Queen's friendship as a result, said that Sharp quickly came to know and comply with the Queen's wishes on all subjects. However, the Queen never appointed a bishop without consulting Sharp and always tried to obtain his consent to her choice. By contrast, when Archbishop Tenison who was out of favour protested that he had not been consulted about the appointment of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet as the new Bishop of Winchester in 1707, the Queen cut him short with the cold remark that \\"the matter was decided\\", and she continued to ignore Tenison's wishes on episcopal appointments. The Queen relied on Sharp to support her policies in the House of Lords, although she made it clear that he could vote against her wishes if his conscience so demanded it; he was also expected to act as one of her Parliamentary \\"managers\\", lobbying not only the bishops but also those Yorkshire MPs who were known to him personally. He was a Commissioner for the Union with Scotland in 1705‚Äì7, as was his fellow Archbishop, Tenison. He welcomed the Armenian bishops who came to England in 1713, and corresponded with the Prussian court on the possibility of the Anglican liturgy as a means of reconciliation between Lutherans and Calvinists. On the much debated question of whether the Queen favoured the Old Pretender or the House of Hanover, Sharp, although he died before the matter became critical, was certain that she favoured the Hanoverian succession. He died at Bath on 2 February 1714. At his request the Queen promoted William Dawes to fill the vacant see. Works Robert White. His works (chiefly sermons) were published in 7 volumes in 1754, and in 5 volumes at Oxford in 1829. Family Sharp was married, by John Tillotson, at Clerkenwell in 1676 to Elizabeth Palmer of Winthorpe, Lincolnshire. Of his fourteen children, only four survived him. Of these, John Sharp (1678‚Äì1727) of Grafton Park represented Ripon in Parliament from 1701 to 1714; he was a commissioner of trade from 15 September 1713 to September 1714, and died on 9 March 1726‚Äì7; in Wicken church, Northamptonshire, there is a monument to him and his wife Anna Maria, daughter of Charles Hosier of Wicken Park. Thomas (1693‚Äì1758), the youngest son, was a churchman and the biographer of his father. The English surgeon William Sharp and his brother the abolitionist Granville Sharp were sons of Thomas. Sir Joshua Sharp, Sheriff of London in 1713, was the Archbishop's brother.

Originally migrants from North Western India sometime between the 6th and 11th centuries, they have long had a presence in the region. Since the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the Romani population have experienced considerable hardship, having been a main target of Nazi extermination programs during World War II, and the subject of forced relocation and other radical social policies during the Communist era. In the successor state, the Czech Republic, challenges remain for the Romani population with respect to education and poverty, and there are frequent tensions with the ethnically Czech majority population over issues including crime and integration. Demographics According to the 2011 census, the Romani population was 13,150, 0.2% of the total number reporting some nationality. Of these, 5,199 responded by listing only Romani nationality; the remaining 7,951 listed their Romani nationality in combination with another nationality, for example, Romani and Czech, Romani and Moravian and so on. In the 2001 Census, 11,746 people reported their nationality as Romani ‚Äì 0.1% of those claiming some nationality. However, 40,370 respondents to the 2011 census reported Romani language as their language. History = Origin = The Romani people originate from Northern India,Current Biology. most likely from the northwestern Indian states Rajasthan and Punjab. Linguistic evidence indicates that the roots of Romani language lie in India; the language shares grammatical characteristics with Indian languages, as well as a large part of the basic lexicon, such as body parts or daily routines. More specifically, Romani shares its basic lexicon with Hindi and Punjabi. It shares many phonetic features with Marwari, while its grammar is closest to Bengali. Sign banning entry of itinerant Gypsies and rovers, 1920s The results of a genetic study in 2012 suggest that the Romani originated in North Western India and migrated as a group. The study indicates that the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of North India, traditionally referred to collectively as the ·∏åoma, are the likely ancestors of modern European Roma. In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the Indian Minister of External Affairs stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the Government of India to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora. = World War II = During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II, Romani were exterminated by Nazi mobile killing units and in camps such as Lety, Hodon√≠n and Auschwitz. 90% of native Romani were killed during the war; the Romani in modern-day Czech Republic are mostly post-war immigrants from Slovakia or Hungary and their descendants. = Communist era = During the communist years unsuccessful attempts to change the nomadic living style of Romani were undertaken by the government. Many Romani people were rehoused in panel√°k housing estates, which subsequently fell into acute disrepair, such as the Ch√°nov housing estate near Most. After 1989, some Romani women accused the state of \\"forced sterilizations\\" arguing that they were not properly informed of what \\"sterilization\\" meant. According to Czech ombudsman Otakar Motejl, \\"at least 50 Romani women were unlawfully sterilized\\". The Czech representative at the United Nations protested against the accusations, claiming that they were \\"false\\" and that Romani women \\"exaggerate in all cases\\". A hospital in Vitkovice, Ostrava, apologised to a Romani woman who was sterilised after her second caesarean, but a request for a compensation of 1 million Czech crowns was rejected by the court.  Emigration  Many Romani left the country after the independence of the Czech Republic, saying that they felt unsafe due to a surge in right-wing activity. Countries such as Ireland, the UK, Norway and Sweden took in large numbers, but most Romani returned home after a few years. Immigration rates to Great Britain dropped suddenly after financial support for refugees started to be paid out in the form of food tickets in summer 2000 (due to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999).* The following year, British customs officers began to check the passengers flying to the UK from Prague airport and routinely rejected those of Romani origin. In October 1997, after receiving over 1,000 requests for asylum from Czech Roma within a single year, Canada reinstated a visa regime for Czech citizens. Anti-ziganism Violent anti-Roma protests in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice in 2013 The Romanis are at the centre of the agenda of far-right groups in the Czech Republic, which spread anti- ziganism. One highly publicized case was the V√≠tkov arson attack of 2009, in which four right-wing extremists seriously injured a three-year-old Romani girl. The public responded by donating money as well as presents to the family, who were able to buy a new house from the donations, while the perpetrators were sentenced to 18 and 22 years in prison. In January 2010, Amnesty International launched a report titled Injustice Renamed: Discrimination in Education of Roma persists in the Czech Republic.Injustice Renamed: Discrimination in Education of Roma persists in the Czech Republic Amnesty International report, January 2010 According to the BBC, Amnesty argued that while cosmetic changes had been introduced by the authorities, little genuine improvement in addressing discrimination against Romani children had occurred. According to a 2010 opinion poll, 68% of Czechs have antipathy towards Romani. The survey also found that 82% Czechs oppose any form of a \\"special care of Roma rights\\", 83% of Czechs consider Romani asocial, and 45% of Czechs would support the expulsion of Romani people from the Czech Republic. A 2011 poll, which followed a number of brutal attacks by Romani perpetrators against white victims, reported that 44% of Czechs are afraid of Roma people. The majority of Czechs (90%) do not want Romani people as neighbours, viewing them as thieves and social parasites. Despite a long waiting list for adoptive parents, Romani children from orphanages are almost never adopted by Czech couples. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 jobs traditionally employing Romanis either disappeared or were taken over by immigrant workers. https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/pdfs/c/czechrep/czech.928/czech928full.pdf The 2019 Pew Research poll found that 66% of Czechs held unfavorable views of Roma. Crime Crime statistics from the early 1990s reported that the crime rate among the Romani population in Czechoslovakia was highly disproportionate, especially regarding burglaries. According to ≈ò√≠ƒçan (1998), about 20‚Äì30% of the Romani population earn their livelihood in illegal ways, such as procuring prostitution, trafficking and other property crimes. Romani make up more than 60% of the Czech prison population and about 50% of repeat offenders, and are thus more than 20 times over-represented in Czech prisons than their population share would suggest.

The many bracing wires used to strengthen the aircraft made it resemble a giant spider, hence its name Spin (Dutch for \\"spider\\"), and Spinne in German. Fokker built the Spin in 1910 while he was a student in Germany, assisted by Jacob Goedecker and a business partner, Franz von Daum, who procured the engine. The aircraft started out as an experimental design to provide Fokker with a means to explore his interest in flying. The first Spin was destroyed when Von Daum flew it into a tree, but the engine was still salvageable and was used to build the second version. This was built soon afterwards and was used by Fokker to teach himself to fly and to obtain his pilot license. This aircraft was also irreparably damaged by Von Daum. Grote Kerk in Haarlem on 1 September 1911 In Fokker's third model, he gained fame in his home country of the Netherlands by flying around the tower of the Grote or St.-Bavokerk, a church in his hometown Haarlem, on 1 September 1911. After this success he founded an aircraft factory and flying school near Berlin. There, the M.1 through M.4 were developed for the German Army, based on the Spin. The M.1 was a two-seat monoplane built in small numbers as the M.3. It was first flown in 1911 and by 1913 had been transferred to military flying schools. The M.2 was a true military version of the Spin. The airplane had a 75 kW (100 hp) Argus or Mercedes engine and was capable of 97 km/h (60 mph). The ten M.2s ordered for 299,880 Marks included 10 Daimler trucks to move the aircraft with the Army, per plans of the German General Staff at the time. The M.2 was a much refined aircraft with a streamlined fuselage, first flown in 1912. The M.4 was developed from the M.3, and included a nose wheel. It did not gain further sales. From 1912 to 1913, a total of 25 Fokker Spins were built (including a few two-seat variants), used mostly for pilot training. Fokker Spin, 3rd model One of the last Spins was brought by Fokker to the Netherlands after World War I. It was incomplete and rebuilt in the early 1920s. During World War II, the plane was taken to an aviation museum in Berlin as a war trophy by the Germans occupying the Netherlands. After the war it was brought to Poland. Not until 1986 was it returned to the Netherlands where it was restored. A second surviving Spin was built by Fokker personnel in 1936 to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Anthony Fokker's first flight. Both of these planes are preserved at the Aviodrome aviation museum at Lelystad Airport, the Netherlands. Construction The fuselage simply consists of two wooden beams with cross members on which the pilot is seated and on which an Argus four-cylinder water-cooled engine is mounted in the front. The radiators are placed on the side of the fuselage. The wings and tail consist of two steel tubes with bamboo ribs. The landing gear is also constructed of steel tubing. The whole structure is held together with steel wire. Later versions have a more streamlined fuselage.

This kind of novel concentrates on the experiences a person had during his lifetime, the people they met and the incidents which occurred. Like other forms of biographical fiction, details are often trimmed or reimagined to meet the artistic needs of the fictional genre, the novel. These reimagined biographies are sometimes called semi-biographical novels, to distinguish the relative historicity of the work from other biographical novels Some biographical novels bearing only superficial resemblance to the historical novels or introducing elements of other genres that supersede the retelling of the historical narrative, for example Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter follows the plot devices of a vampire fiction closely. Biographical fiction often also falls within the genres of historical fiction or alternative history. Some novels that are known best for their fictional prowess, but include extensive biographical information that is less obvious to readers. A very good example of this kind is Goldsmith's \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" and is believed to be the biography of a person the author had known and observed very closely.

Most notably, he was the landscape architect who designed the gardens of the Palace of Versailles, and his work represents the height of the French formal garden style, or jardin √† la fran√ßaise. Prior to working on Versailles, Le N√¥tre collaborated with Louis Le Vau and Charles Le Brun on the park at Vaux-le- Vicomte. His other works include the design of gardens and parks at Chantilly, Fontainebleau, Saint-Cloud and Saint-Germain. His contribution to planning was also significant: at the Tuileries he extended the westward vista, which later became the avenue of the Champs-√âlys√©es and comprise the Axe historique.Garrigues, p.282 Biography = Early life = Andr√© Le N√¥tre was born in Paris, into a family of gardeners. Pierre Le N√¥tre, who was in charge of the gardens of the Palais des Tuileries in 1572, may have been his grandfather.Jules Guiffrey, p.3 Andr√©'s father Jean Le N√¥tre was also responsible for sections of the Tuileries gardens, initially under Claude Mollet, and later as head gardener, during the reign of Louis XIII. Andr√© was born on 12 March 1613, and was baptised at the √âglise Saint-Roch. His godfather at the ceremony was an administrator of the royal gardens, and his godmother was the wife of Claude Mollet. The family lived in a house within the Tuilieries, and Andr√© thus grew up surrounded by gardening, and quickly acquired both practical and theoretical knowledge. The location also allowed him to study in the nearby Palais du Louvre, part of which was then used as an academy of the arts. He learned mathematics, painting and architecture, and entered the atelier of Simon Vouet, painter to Louis XIII, where he met and befriended the painter Charles Le Brun. He learned classical art and perspective, and studied for several years under the architect Fran√ßois Mansart, a friend of Le Brun. =Career= Bust of Andr√© Le N√¥tre at the Garden of the Tuileries In 1635, Le N√¥tre was named the principal gardener of the king's brother Gaston, duc d'Orl√©ans. On 26 June 1637, Le N√¥tre was appointed head gardener at the Tuileries, taking over his father's position.Guiffrey, p.5 He had primary responsibility for the areas of the garden closest to the palace, including the orangery built by Simon Bouchard.Guiffrey, p. 9. In 1643 he was appointed \\"draughtsman of plants and terraces\\" for Anne of Austria, the queen mother, and from 1645 to 1646 he worked on the modernisation of the gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau. He was later put in charge of all the royal gardens of France, and in 1657 he was further appointed Controller-General of the Royal Buildings. There are few direct references to Le N√¥tre in the royal accounts, and Le N√¥tre himself seldom wrote down his ideas or approach to gardening. He expressed himself purely through his gardens.Guiffrey, p.18 He became a trusted advisor to Louis XIV, and in 1675 he was ennobled by the King. He and Le Brun even accompanied the court at the siege of Cambrai in 1677.Guiffrey, p. 22. In 1640, he married Fran√ßoise Langlois. They had three children, although none survived to adulthood. Vaux-le-Vicomte Vaux-le-Vicomte Andr√© Le N√¥tre's first major garden design was undertaken for Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV's Superintendent of Finances. Fouquet began work on the Ch√¢teau de Vaux-le- Vicomte in 1657, employing the architect Louis Le Vau, the painter Charles Le Brun, and Le N√¥tre. The three designers worked in partnership, with Le N√¥tre laying out a grand, symmetrical arrangement of parterres, pools and gravel walks. Le Vau and Le N√¥tre exploited the changing levels across the site, so that the canal is invisible from the house, and employed forced perspective to make the grotto appear closer than it really is. The gardens were complete by 1661, when Fouquet held a grand entertainment for the king. But only three weeks later, on 10 September 1661, Fouquet was arrested for embezzling state funds, and his artists and craftsmen were taken into the king's service. Versailles Gardens of Versailles Plan view of the gardens of Versailles From 1661, Le N√¥tre was working for Louis XIV to build and enhance the garden and parks of the Ch√¢teau de Versailles. Louis extended the existing hunting lodge, eventually making it his primary residence and seat of power. Le N√¥tre also laid out the radiating city plan of Versailles, which included the largest avenue yet seen in Europe, the Avenue de Paris. In the following century, the Versailles design influenced Pierre Charles L'Enfant's master plan for Washington, D.C. See, L'Enfant Plan. = Other gardens = France In 1661, Le N√¥tre was also working on the gardens at the Palace of Fontainebleau. In 1663 he was engaged at Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud, residence of Philippe d'Orl√©ans, where he would oversee works for many years. Also from 1663, Le N√¥tre was engaged at Ch√¢teau de Chantilly, property of the Prince de Cond√©, where he worked with his brother-in-law Pierre Desgots until the 1680s.Hazlehurst 1980, pp. 5, 303‚Äì323. Pierre Desgots married Le N√¥tre's sister Elisabeth, and their son, Claude Desgots, became Le N√¥tre's disciple and successor (see Mariage 1999, p. 30). From 1664 he was rebuilding the gardens of the Tuileries, at the behest of Colbert, Louis's chief minister, who still hoped the king would remain in Paris. In 1667 Le N√¥tre extended the main axis of the gardens westward, creating the avenue which would become the Champs-√âlys√©es. Colbert commissioned Le N√¥tre in 1670, to alter the gardens of his own ch√¢teau de Sceaux, which was ongoing until 1683. Abroad In 1662, he provided designs for Greenwich Park in London, for Charles II of England. In 1670 Le N√¥tre conceived a project for the Castle of Racconigi in Italy, and between 1674 and 1698 he remodelled the gardens of Venaria Reale, near Turin. In 1679, he visited Italy. His later advice was provided for Charlottenburg Palace and ch√¢teau de Cassel in Germany, and with plans for Windsor Castle. Final works Between 1679 and 1691, he was involved in the planning of the gardens of Ch√¢teau de Meudon for Fran√ßois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois. His work has often been favorably compared and contrasted (\\"the antithesis\\") to the ≈ìuvre of Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown, the English landscape architect.

T√≠m√°r was capped four times by the Hungary national team. Playing career BornBorn in Budapest, Tim√°r began his career with Ferencv√°ros in 1995 before having two-year spells with MTK Hung√°ria and BKV El≈ëre. He spent the next four-years with four clubs in two countries before returning to his first club, Ferencv√°ros. In early January 2007 his form for them attracted interest from Plymouth Argyle and he signed on loan for the Pilgrims for the remainder of the 2006‚Äì07 season, with compatriot P√©ter Halmosi. He made a great start to his loan period with a debut goal in the 2‚Äì2 draw with Wolves at Molineux.Timar Nets The duo impressed and they both joined the club permanently in May 2007.

He was selected in the eighth round by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1987 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Washington. Early years Gogan attended Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory in San Francisco, California. He helped his football team win 2 city championships as a two-way player (offensive and defensive tackle). He also lettered in baseball, where he started as a catcher, before being forced to move to first base as a senior, because his size didn't allow the umpires to see the home plate. College career Gogan accepted a football scholarship from the University of Washington, to play under head coach Don James. He became a three-year starter at right tackle. As a senior, he missed 2 games with a sprained knee. He received honorable mention All-American and second- team All-Pac-10 honors. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Gogan was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the eight round (206th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft, as part of a change in the offensive line philosophy, when the team started to value size and strength over speed and athletic ability. He became a starter at the right tackle as a rookie, when Phil Pozderac announced his retirement in Week 6 of the season after the strike. On August 3, 1988, he was suspended 30 days for marijuana use. In 1989, he missed 3 games with an injured toe. His attitude and intensity earned him the nickname \\"Big Nasty\\". In 1990, he was relegated to a reserve role after Nate Newton was named the starter at right tackle. He started 4 games at left tackle in place of an injured Mark Tuinei and one game at right guard. He also was used as the third tight end in short-yardage situations. In 1991, he was named the starter at left guard, replacing Crawford Ker, who left the team via Plan B free agency. His blocking helped the offensive line become one of the best units in the NFL, while contributing to Emmit Smith leading the league in rushing yards (1,563) and Michael Irvin in receiving yards (1,523). In 1992, he became a backup after Nate Newton was moved to left guard, in order to accommodate Erik Williams as the starter at right tackle. He also was used as the third tight end in short-yardage situations. He started in the season finale at left guard in place of an injured Newton. In 1993, he beat out John Gesek as the starter at right guard. His role in one of the greatest offensive lines in NFL history was detailed in NFL Network's 2013 A Football Life episode \\"The Great Wall of Dallas\\". Before the start of the 1994 season, four of the Cowboys offensive linemen were free agents, so management focused on re-signing Newton. Gogan opted to leave and was replaced with free agent Derek Kennard. =Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders= On April 17, 1994, he signed as free agent with the Los Angeles Raiders, where he was named the starter at right guard. He was a three-year starter and received his first Pro Bowl selection. =San Francisco 49ers= On February 24, 1997, Gogan signed as free agent with the San Francisco 49ers. Although he didn't fit the team's offensive line scheme, he received Pro Bowl honors two years in a row at right guard. In 1998, he helped Garrison Hearst set a team rushing record with 1,549 yards and received second-team All-Pro honors. During the fourth-quarter of the 1998 Pro Bowl, Neil Smith took offense at Gogan going for his legs during a running play. As Gogan returned to the huddle, Smith hit him on the back of the helmet, which resulted in the first Pro Bowl ejections since the game was moved to Hawaii in 1980. On March 1, 1999, the 49ers had salary cap problems and traded him to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for a fifth-round draft choice (#157-Terry Jackson). =Miami Dolphins= In 1999, he reunited with former head coach Jimmy Johnson. He began the season as the starter at left guard, but he was later moved to the right side because of the play of Mark Dixon. He ended up in a platoon situation with Kevin Donnalley, alternating starts. He started 10 games and extended his consecutive games played streak to over 150 contests. On February 25, 2000, he was waived because of age and salary cap issues.https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl- xpm-2000-02-26-0002260134-story.html =San Diego Chargers= On June 5, 2000, he signed as a free agent with the San Diego Chargers and started 14 games at right guard. On February 28, 2001, he was released and replaced with Kendyl Jacox. Personal life Gogan was named to three Pro Bowls and had a reputation as being one of the league's dirtiest players during his career. He is currently the NFL analyst for NBX.com and is also an assistant football coach for Mount Si High School in Snoqualmie, Washington.

She made her debut on stage in 1655 at the Amsterdam Schouwburg (Amsterdam Theater) in a play by Jan Jacobsz. Schipper which accidentally bore her name ‚ÄòOnvergelijkelijke Ariana‚Äô (‚ÄòIncomparable Ariana‚Äô). Early life The daughter of actor and playwright Adriaan van den Bergh, Ariana was born in Middelburg probably between 1626 and 1628. Her father had a travelling theatre company and translated and adapted several English dramas for the Dutch stage. Among them Thomas Kyd's ‚Äúthe Spanish Tragedy‚Äù-renamed Don Jeronimo (1621) in Dutch. Ariana could possibly not write. She may have learnt the craft at a very early age. It was quite common for women and children in travelling theatre companies to appear on stage as these groups often consisted of actors‚Äô families. Later on, she possibly joined the troupe of Jan Baptist van Fornenbergh. This company took the tradition of Dutch theatre to distant corners of Europe touring the north of Germany and Scandinavia, performing at fairs as well as royal courts such as the one of Swedish Queen Christina (1653). While in Hamburg, the actress married her colleague, the actor Gillis Nozeman in the Reformed Church of nearby Altona, a free haven for dissenters and marginalized. Ariana and Gillis became known as the first actors‚Äôcouple in Dutch theatre history. Professional life On June 30, 1655, the name of Ariana Nozeman was recorded for the first time in the Amsterdam theatre archives. The actress was paid 76,50 Dutch florins for 17 performances, which was higher than most of her male counterparts.. Ariana was even paid more than her husband because she brought her own opulent costumes to the scene. Unlike Italy and France where women had already made their appearances on the public stage, women‚Äôs parts in the Dutch Republic were still generally being played by men in the first half of the 17th century. The resignation of six actors at the Amsterdam Schouwburg (Theatre) may have led to Ariana Nozeman‚Äôs debut. Ariana Nozeman mostly played serious roles. She was the first actress who ever performed Badeloch in the historical play Gijsbrecht van Aemstel by Joost van den Vondel, one of Holland‚Äôs most famous poets of the 17th century. Ariana was rarely seen in farces or comical acts and she also sang. She is credited as the first ballet dancer in The Netherlands. She was often seen on stage together with her husband Gillis Nozeman either as a couple or as antagonists. Their daughter Maria Nozeman (born 1652) followed in her mother‚Äôs footsteps; she entered the stage at the age of six years. The Nozemans supplemented their theatre incomes by running an inn called The Camel on one of the Amsterdam canals. Calvinist opposition By putting herself on public show, Ariana Nozeman would surely not have had the approval of the stern Dutch Reformed Church. Simon Schama in The Embarrassment of Riches says: ‚ÄúIn 1655 the first actress appeared in the Amsterdam theater, strengthening the clergy‚Äôs view that it was the sink of the vilest iniquity. But Adriana Nozeman went on to make an illustrious career there nonetheless‚Äù. Holland, in spite of its Calvinist character, was a secular society and Amsterdam, the capital of the mighty Dutch Republic, known for its free and tolerant climate. Banned philosophers such as Locke and Descartes got their works published here. Pornography was printed here as well. The stage curtain dropped for Ariana Nozeman when she was not even 35 years old. She died on December 7, 1661. Three months earlier, she had lost her only 7-year-old son Mathijs. Maybe she died of heartbreak or maybe she fell victim to the plague. She was buried in the Oude Kerk (Old Church), now in the heart of Amsterdam‚Äôs famous red light district. Her death meant a great loss for the Amsterdam Schouwburg. They contracted immediately four new actresses to replace her. Three hundred years after her stage debut, in 1955, the first woman on the Dutch stage was commemorated. The city council of Amsterdam honoured her memory with a street named Ariana Nozemanstraat in the western part of the city. References *Ben Albach: Langs Kermissen en Hoven.

In ancient Greek cult, kriophoros () or criophorus, the \\"ram-bearer,\\" is a figure that commemorates the solemn sacrifice of a ram. It becomes an epithet of Hermes: Hermes Kriophoros.  Myth  At the Boeotian city of Tanagra, Pausanias relates a local myth that credited the god with saving the city in a time of plague, by carrying a ram on his shoulders as he made the circuit of the city's walls: > There are sanctuaries of Hermes Kriophoros and of Hermes called Promachos. > They account for the former surname by a story that Hermes averted a > pestilence from the city by carrying a ram round the walls; to commemorate > this Calamis made an image of Hermes carrying a ram upon his shoulders. > Whichever of the youths is judged to be the most handsome goes round the > walls at the feast of Hermes, carrying a lamb on his shoulders.Pausanias, > Description of Greece 9.22.1‚Äì2. The myth may be providing an etiological explanation of a cult practice, carried out to avert miasma, the ritual pollution that had brought disease, a propitiatory act whose ancient origins had become lost but had ossified in this iconic motif. Reflections of Calamis' lost Hermes Kriophoros may be detectable on the Roman coinage of the city. In Messenia, at the sacred grove of Karnasus, Pausanias noted that Apollon Karneios and Hermes Kriophoros had a joint cult,Pausanias, Description of Greece 4.33.4. the ram-bearers (kriophoroi) joining in male initiation rites. A description by Pausanias of a Kriophoros dedicated at Olympia, by the sculptor Onatas, has been compared by Jos√© D√∂rigD√∂rig, Onatas of Aegina (Leiden:Brill) 1977. with a surviving bronze statuette, 8.6 cm tall, in the Cabinet des M√©dailles, Paris, as a basis for reconstructing the Severe style of the sculptor. Moschophoros of the Acropolis, 570 BC. Not all ancient Greek sculptures of sacrifiants with an offering on their shoulders bear young rams. The nearly lifesize marble Calfbearer (moschophoros), of ca 570 BC, found on the Athenian Acropolis in 1864 (illustration, left) is inscribed \\"Rhombos\\", apparently the donor, who commemorated his sacrifice in this manner.Orell Witthuhn, \\"Der Kalbtr√§ger von der Akropolis in Athen\\". The sacrificial animal in the case is a young bull, but the iconic pose, with the young animal across the sacrifiant's shoulders, secured by forelegs and rear legs firmly in the sacrifiant's grip, is the same as many kriophoroi. This is the most famous of the Kriophoros sculptures and is exhibited at the Acropolis Museum Lewis R. FarnellThe Cults of the Greek States 1896, vol. I, part I, p. 9. placed this Hermes Kriophoros foremost in Arcadia: :\\"As Arcadia has been from time immemorial the great pasture-ground of Greece, so probably the most primitive character in which Hermes appeared, and which he never abandoned, was pastoral. He is the Lord of the herds, epim√©lios and kriophoros, who leads them to the sweet waters, and bears the tired ram or lamb on his shoulders, and assists them with the shepherd's crook, the kerykeion.\\" The Kriophoros figure of a shepherd carrying a lamb, simply as a pastoral vignette, became a common figure in series denoting the months or seasons, characteristically March or April.Noted by Brett 1942:39. Kalamis (Museo Barracco, Rome) Kriophoroi and \\"The Good Shepherd\\" Free- standing fourth-century AD Roman sculptures, and even third-century ones, are sometimes identified as \\"Christ, the Good Shepherd\\",Two statuettes found in Thessalonike, for example. illustrating the pericope in the Gospel of John, and also the second-century Christian literary work The Shepherd of Hermas. In two-dimensional art, Hermes Kriophoros transformed into the Christ carrying a lamb and walking among his sheep: \\"Thus we find philosophers holding scrolls or a Hermes Kriophoros which can be turned into Christ giving the Law (Traditio Legis) and the Good Shepherd respectively\\" (Peter and Linda Murray, The Oxford Companion to Classical Art and Architecture, p. 475.). The Good Shepherd is a common motif from the Catacombs of Rome (Gardner, 10, fig 54) and in sarcophagus reliefs, where Christian and pagan symbolism are often combined, making secure identifications difficult. The theme does appear in the wall-paintings of the baptistery of the Dura-Europos church, a house- church at Dura-Europos before 256 AD, and more familiarly in sixth-century Christian mosaics, as in the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia at Ravenna, and there is a famous free-standing sculpture, said to be of about 300AD, and made for a Christian, in the Vatican Museums. Not every Kriophoros, even in Christian times, is Christ, the Good Shepherd: a Kriophoros shepherd, fleeing with his flock from the attack of a wolf, was interpreted as a purely pastoral figure rather than as Christ, the Good Shepherd, when it appeared in the refined late fourth-early fifth century floor mosaics of a colonnade round a courtyard in the Great Palace at Constantinople.Gerard Brett, \\"The Mosaic of the Great Palace in Constantinople\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 5 (1942:34-43) p. 39 and pl. 10c. Nonetheless, \\"the shepherd must have been the picture most frequently found in [Christian] places of worship before Constantine,\\"Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; p. 23; Burns & Oates, London, 1962 as the most common of the symbolic depictions of Jesus used during the persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire, when Early Christian art was necessarily furtive and ambiguous. By the fifth-century, the relatively few depictions leave no doubt as to the identity of the shepherd, as at Ravenna.

Early life and education Frank Taylor Farmer was born in Bexleyheath, Kent and studied at Eltham College before graduating with a first-class honours degree in electrical engineering from King's College London in 1933. He then continued to the University of Cambridge, where he completed a four-year PhD on radio-wave propagation in the ionosphere, working as part of J. A. Ratcliffe's research group. He continued researching this topic thereafter at the Marconi Research Centre near Chelmsford, Essex. Career In 1940, Farmer began working as assistant physicist in the radiography department at Middlesex Hospital, one of a group of physicists employed by London hospitals during the war to work on issues related to the emerging technology of X-rays, and the use of radium to treat cancer. These issues would become the central focus of Farmer's subsequent career. One of the instruments he invented while at Middlesex, the Farmer dosimeter, became a standard tool used in hospitals around the world to calibrate X-ray machines, and is still produced commercially today. In 1945 he moved to become head physicist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. The hospital at that time had Marconi deep therapy X-Ray machines installed, with which Farmer was closely familiar from his time working at Marconi, and as a result the hospital was able to keep these machines in clinical use for many years. Farmer's team brought together experts in health physics, radio-isotopes, ultrasonics, instrumentation and physiological measurement. Specific innovations included the world's first gantry-mounted linear particle accelerator for cancer treatment, installed in 1963, and numerous clinical uses of the radioisotope tracer technique, developed using radio-isotopes from the nuclear reactors at Amersham and Harwell, which became available to researchers after World War II. When the new department opened, Farmer was appointed first Professor of Medical Physics at Newcastle University in 1966. While at the RVI, Farmer and his team turned the facility into a renowned centre for research into medical applications of radio-isotope technology, providing services in these areas to the entire region of Northern England, which had previously had none. At the time of Frank Farmer's retirement in 1978, the department had branches in Teesside and Cumbria, as well as the three hospitals in Newcastle, and employed 70 scientific and technical staff. Farmer was President of the Hospital Physicists Association (1959‚Äì60) and the British Institute of Radiology (1973‚Äì74). During his career he served on the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements and many other professional radiography and research bodies, and authored a large number of scientific papers. He was awarded an OBE in 1973 for services to physics applied to medicine. Personal life Farmer was a devout Quaker, and worked for and with numerous local projects in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne aiming to improve the lives of the homeless, especially in retirement. He was also a member of Friends of the Earth and environmental campaigner, living a frugal life with a solar panel installed on the roof of his house, and a public opponent of nuclear power and nuclear weapons. He was also a keen amateur shortwave radio enthusiast. In 1977 the Wireless Institute of Australia awarded him the Cook Bicentenary Award for his dedication to the shortwave radio community. In 1960, Frank Farmer married Dr. Marion Bethune, a paediatric cardiologist, who died before him. He died of pancreatic cancer in St. Oswald's Hospice in Newcastle in 2004, aged 91.

It was established to protect the forests, fauna and watersheds of an approximately area of the eastern slopes of the Maya Mountains. The reserve was established in 1986 as the first protected area for protection of the jaguar (Panthera onca). It is regarded as a premier site for jaguar preservation in the world.Emmons, K. M. et al. (1996). Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary. Producciones de la Hamaca, Belize and Orang-utan Press, Gays Mills, Wisconsin, USA. The name 'Cockscomb' derives from the appearance of the Cockscomb Mountain ridge, that resembles a rooster's comb, which is situated at the northern fringe of the reserve and which is easily visible from the coastal plain of the Caribbean Sea. Habitation by the ancient Mayas occurred in the Cockscomb Basin as early as 10,000 BCE. However, the first modern exploration in the recorded history of the basin did not occur until 1888.Peter Dunham, Memorandum to Osmany Salas May 23, 1995 Geography South Stann Creek, in the Cockscomb West Basin section The Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary is actually comprised by two adjacent geographic basins. The West Basin is drained by the Swasey Branch, which is one of the main tributaries to the Monkey River. The East Basin consists of the upper watershed of South Stann Creek. The West Basin, being more difficult to access given distance from trailheads and higher forest density, is as of the current time still relatively unexplored from the standpoint of species mapping, Mayan ruins and other environmental details.Ecology of Cockscomb Basin, Belize, Lumina Technologies Inc. (2006) The reserve is generally lozenge-shaped, spanning an east‚Äìwest dimension of approximately and a north‚Äìsouth dimension of approximately . Elevation extremes are above sea level in the lower reaches of South Stann Creek to atop Victoria Peak. The West Basin is bounded by the ridge of the Maya Mountains on the west, Cockscomb Mountains on the north, a prominent transverse ridge of the Maya Mountains at the south (of about elevation ) and a low-lying north‚Äìsouth ridge at the east, which separates the West from East Basin. The Swasey Branch exits through the south transverse range via a deep gorge. The East Basin is also bounded on the north by the namesake Cockscomb ridge, to the west by the low-lying north‚Äìsouth ridge separating the two basins, to the east by Cabbage Haul Ridge and to the south by Stann Creek Ridge. South Stann Creek flows out of the East Basin on the south in a meandering gentle gradient that was easily navigated by the British explorers in the 1880s. The site consists of two distinct adjacent watersheds and is accessible via a low- intensity trail system to accommodate visitors and research environmental scientists. Natural history Plant on the forest floor of the Cockscomb West Basin section The Maya Mountains and foothills are among the oldest surface rock formations of Central America; these Paleozoic sediments were uplifted about 200 million years ago in the later part (Pennsylvanian) of the Carboniferous period and the Early Permian period. The principal uplifted rock formations in the Sanctuary are quartzite and sandstone. =Flora= Principal plant communities and habitats are Belizean pine forests, elfin scrub, Pet√©n- Veracruz moist forests, sheltered valley forests, and floodplain thickets. The principal forest type is tropical moist broadleaf forest, which covers moderate to steep slopes,Hiking in the Cockscomb Basin and in some cases sheltered mountain valleys. While much of this forest is secondary due to Mayan era farming as well as modern logging, some of the steeper reaches exhibit primary forest characteristics. Dominant trees in this forest type are mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and cedar (Cedrela odorata), which were prized and hence heavily logged from the early 1900s to late in the 20th century. =Water= Fast flowing clear mountain streams flow to the valley floors of the two basins to yield a more turbid water quality, especially during periods of peak rain. This site is known worldwide as the premier habitat for the jaguar (Panthera onca), which is most often found in the vast almost unexplored West Basin wilderness. The riparian zone forest areas generally feature lush broadleaf rainforest intruding into the verges of fast flowing steep mountain streams as well as the languid meandering valley drainages. There are particularly interesting assemblages of vegetation along the rocky bedded mountain streams which have frequent rapids, waterfalls and deep pools. Due to the density of vegetation and frequent precipitation events, the forest floor often appears fresh and verdant even after several rainless days. History =Mayan= Throughout much of the foothills of the eastern slopes in southern Belize, there is evidence of Mayan habitation since at least 10,000 BCE. The Pearce Ruin was the first Mayan site to have been catalogued in modern history archives in a report to the British Museum in 1931; however, the ruin was not re-sighted until 1995 with the Dunham surveys. At that late date two other Mayan sites were documented: Hun' Tul Mo' (one macaw) and Xa'a Yul Ha' (many rivers). =19th century= The first modern explorations that led to recorded features of the Cockscomb Basin were conducted by the British in expeditions of 1888 and 1889. These adventures began with river excursions up the South Stann Creek and resulted in attainment of what these explorers thought to be Victoria Peak, the highest point in Belize; in fact, later reconstructions showed that the mounting of a nearby peak to Victoria had been scaled. =20th century= View of Cockscomb Basin Further exploration of the Cockscomb Basin did not transpire until 1927, when further British expeditions were launched to assess timber reserves; subsequently, logging began to occur until the year 1984, primarily with extraction of cedar (Cedrela odorata) and mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla). At about the same time as exploitation of these resources was virtually complete, a nationwide study of the jaguar was initiated. This scientific investigation led by Alan Rabinowitz, a recent recipient of the PhD degree from the University of Tennessee, found that the Cockscomb Basin was a particularly important habitat for the jaguar,A.R. Rabinowitz, Jaguar: One Man's Battle to Establish the World's First Jaguar Preserve, Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986) not only in Belize, but from a Central America perspective. In 1986, Rabinowitz and Archie Carr III convinced the government of Belize to establish a no hunting zone with respect to jaguars in a portion of the Cockscomb Basin. By 1990, after further convincing, the Belize government expanded the Sanctuary substantially, and in 1995 another 160 km¬≤ were added to connect the holding to the Bladen Branch Nature Reserve. In 1988, the IUCN declared the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary \\"The major achievement in cat conservation for the triennium\\". In that year, Prince Philip as president of World Wide Fund for Nature‚ÄîWWF, honoured Ignacio Pop for his work in encouraging creation of the reserve. In 1998, the Victoria Peak National Monument area was established embracing 19.59 km¬≤ of protected land.

Cast in 1650, Bernini held onto it in his private collection for 25 years. Corpus is considered one of the artist's \\"long-lost masterpieces\\". It is believed that Bernini cast three versions of Corpus. One version was destroyed during the French Revolution, one belonged to the official collection of the royal family of Spain, and one that was recorded in the Perugia region of Italy in 1790 before going missing. The Corpus donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto was long believed to have been cast by an unknown French artist. In 2004, following new scholarly studies of the work, Corpus was attributed to Bernini, who cast the sculpture for his personal collection. After being \\"lost\\" for over one hundred years, Corpus surfaced in Venice in 1908. Later it fell into private hands in the United States, but by that time it was misidentified as a work from the school of Giambologna. At an auction in 1975, it failed to sell for the very low price of $200. It was not until 2002 that it was recognized as a Bernini. And it took until 2005 for the provenance to be definitely and directly linked to Bernini.

An 1898 map shows the location of Nag√≥rzany (click in it to enlarge) This part of Poland was controlled by Austria for almost 120 years. At that time the area (including west and east of Subcarpathian Voivodship) was known as Galicia. In 1785 the village lands comprised 6 ¬Ω lan. There were 50 Greek Catholics, 267 Roman Catholics and 5 Jews. In 1899 the village lands comprised 3,43 km¬≤. There were 49 Greek Catholics, 431 Roman Catholics, and 10 Jews. The church at Nag√≥rzany is right on the road an easy to get to. Church was \\"Saint Michael\\" 1848 - Apostles Saints Peter & Paul\\". The name was changed from Saint Michael in 1864. The cemetery has a few headstones in it. On April 1946 the village was attacked by a strong unit of UPA and some buildings were burnt. Only over a dozen years after the war the village started to rebuild.3,000 in rebel band terrorized Galicia, Ukrainian Nationalists, German deserters led by SS colonel burn 3 villages (Nowotaniec, Nag√≥rzany, and Bukowsko) in a night (by wireless to The New York Times) Sanok, Poland, April 17, 1946 ‚Äì a strong, well- organized and elusive band of Ukrainian nationalists and German deserters, estimated at more than 3,000 under the leadership of a German colonel, in a fortnight have succeeded in transformating this sector of the Carpathian foothills of old Galicia into a virtual partisan stronghold. With the burning of three large villages on a single night two weeks ago, they now have made 10,000 of thise area's total pre war population of 135,000 homeless and are resisting with complete success all efforts to quell what is tantamount to open insurrection. [...] The writer of this dispatch lat week went to the heart of the bandit country, to the village of Bukowsko, where on the night of April 4 the bandits burned down all but eleven of the 400 houses and made more than 3,000 persons homeless. Our escort consisted of therefugee Mayor, now in Sanok and two squads of well-armed Security Police under the command of a nervous 20-year-old second lieutenant. Before burning the village the bandits who were well armed with German and Russian automatics and machine guns, had demanded 1,000,000 zlotys tribute, and the village had raised 300,000. On the night of the fire the villagers received scant warning a few hours before from a peasant that the bandits were coming, but had not had time to remove their cattle. At one time the entire village was burned to the ground by the UPA with the exception of two houses belonging to Lemkos. No one was killed but every house was destroyed.

The project is dedicated to producing a tapestry in fifteen panels which tells the story of the coming of the Normans to Ireland in the 12th century and the foundation of the port and town of New Ross at the beginning of the 13th century. Each tapestry panel is approximately four and a half feet deep (1.5m) by six feet (1.8m) wide and tells of a unique aspect of the epic story. Six panels were finished for an Exhibition in 2007 and a further nine panels are now (2020) completed. History of the Project =Beginning= The project began in May 1998 with an idea to make a tapestry telling the story of the coming of the Normans to Ireland in tapestry form and to hang this tapestry in the historic St. Mary's Church of Ireland Church in New Ross. The idea originated with the Rector of the Church, Reverend Paul Mooney, who then consulted with Alexis Bernstorff, an art historian and professional in the field of tapestry and fabric restoration. Over the summer of 1998, Dr. Mooney and Alexis Bernstorff consulted with local artist Ms. Reiltin Murphy to create a visualisation of how the tapestry could be best displayed in the Church of Ireland parish church. At that time the focus of the tapestry widened from the story of the Norman expansion into Ireland in the latter part of the 12th century to include the founding of the port and town of New Ross at the beginning of the 13th century. A provisional list of fifteen themes for tapestry panels was outlined, as well as the measurements for the panels to be hung from the gallery of the late Georgian, early 19th-century church. Countess Ann Griffin Bernstorff, professional artist and mother of Alexis Bernstorff, was approached to consider designing the tapestry and offered to paint the cartoons for the fifteen panels. Countess Bernstorff began with some experimental pieces in the Autumn of 1998 and a draft plan for the project was produced and circulated at that time. =Planning= In the spring of 1999, a small committee of people began to plan for the project in earnest, and New Ross lawyer Simon Kennedy freely gave of his time and services to draft articles of association for the project and to register the project as a company limited by guarantee without shares. This not-for-profit legal status helped pave the way for applications for grants and for the successful application for status for the project. =Painting= Meanwhile, following extensive historical research Countess Bernstorff painted the cartoon for the first tapestry panel which depicted the Hook Lighthouse in the Medieval era. This lighthouse is the oldest continually serving working lighthouse in Europe and was founded by monks in the early Middle Ages as Christianity came into southeast Ireland. This panel was given to a group of volunteer stitchers in Fethard-on-Sea in early 2000, as there is a policy to locate the creation each panel close to the historical location, and this panel was completed over the next three years. Alexis Bernstorff supervised the training of stitchers and the coordination of the production of the tapestry panel and served in this capacity on all tapestry panels. =Stitching= From 2000 to 2012, twelve panels were produced by the extraordinary commitment, skill and 'espirit de corp' of the voluntary stitchers. These panels are: * Evening ‚Äì The Lighthouse at Hook Head produced in Fethard-on-Sea * Hunt in the Forest of Ros depicting William Marshal and Isabel de Clare hunting in the Forest around New Ross, produced by the Davidstown-Clonroche group * Gothic Glory ‚Äì The building of the Parish Church of St. Mary‚Äôs in 1210 depicting the building of the original 13th-century St. Mary's Church in New Ross produced by the Bawnmore-New Ross group * The Thriving Port of Ros depicting Italian bankers at the Quay in 13th-century New Ross port, also produced by the Davidstown-Clonroche group * The Abduction of Dervorgilla, stitched near Ferns, Co Wexford * The Siege of Wexford, at Wexford town * Arrogant Trespass ‚Äì The Normans Landing at Bannow Strand, Duncannon Fort * William Marshal ‚Äì The Flower of Chivalry at Crossabeg, Wexford * The Marriage of Isabel de Clare and William Marshal at Bunclody * Ex Voto Tintern Abbey ‚Äì William Marshal‚Äôs Stormy Crossing to Ireland, at Poulfur, Fethard-on-sea * The Sheaf of Corn ‚Äì The Distaff Descent at Bawnmore, New Ross.

After demolition of the original building, a new one opened in 2005 with a maximum occupancy of 300, which is about three times the standard McDonald's patron seating capacity. The original 1983 building and the first design of the rebuilt 2005 structure site held a rock and roll exhibit in a building adjacent to the restaurant and a small upstairs McDonald's museum display.

Clark Street since 1983, though the new building was redeveloped and reopened on April 15, 2005 as a bi-level flagship restaurant/museum with a two lane drive through. This is the first McDonald's location with a two-lane drive-through. The reopening coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Des Plaines, Illinois restaurant which was opened by Ray Kroc on April 15, 1955. Rock N Roll McDonald's is the location where the corporation kicked off its celebration of the 50th anniversary of the franchise. Among the celebrities in attendance were Colin Powell and Elton John. At the time of the 2004 demolition, the location was the 3rd busiest in the United States and 12th in the world. In the early 1990s, it had been the busiest in the United States. It was expected to increase its sales revenue rankings from 3rd in the United States and 12th in the world with the renovation and redevelopment. The restaurant is priced higher than other Chicago-area McDonald's, in order to subsidize the interior decor which includes numerous plasma display flat screen televisions and expensive Italian lighting. Its second floor includes a coffee bar serving lattes, gelato and biscotti and lounges that pay homage via museum display, music, and decor to every decade the chain has been in business. The 2nd floor McCaf√© is designed to compete with Starbucks by serving cappuccino, espresso, gelato and Italian pastries. The building features a pair of 60 foot arches and two stories worth of windows that weigh 800 pounds apiece. It has 10 cash register stations to complement its 300 patron capacity, which is about 3 times the normal McDonald's capacity. The restaurant has three front walls of glass. Franchisee Marilyn Wright and her husband Ralph Wright have operated 10 McDonald's locations for the past 12 years. In addition to a perimeter of trees, the building has two green roof gardens on two levels. The lower one is visible from inside. However, the upper roof is only visible from surrounding high- rise buildings. Neither accommodates customer access. The trash cans in this tourist mecca say thank you in ten languages. The restaurant has separate preparation lines for white meat and red meat in the giant kitchen. The demolished building faced Ohio Street, but the new building is rotated 180 degrees to face the Ontario Street tourist pedestrian strip. The restaurant was sung about by the cult Chicago musician Wesley Willis in a song entitled \\"Rock N Roll McDonald's\\", which expresses a negative opinion of McDonald's. The song was featured in the movie Super Size Me. =Museum= The south (rear) half of the upstairs portion has a series of displays of early McDonald's photos, multimedia, and paraphernalia including the fast food giant's striped polyester uniforms from the '60s. Much of it is arranged by decade going back to the mid-1950s when McDonald's first opened and is accompanied by pop culture artifacts such as pet rocks, early cell phones, and 8-track tape players. Downstairs there is a section on the first floor entitled \\"Chicago Firsts,\\" featuring events and organizations that originated in Chicago. Neighborhood The restaurant/museum, its rock and roll exhibit and its parking lot occupy the entire block bounded by West Ontario Street to the north, West Ohio Street to the south, North LaSalle Street to the west and North Clark Street to the east in the River North neighborhood of the Near North Side community area. The building is situated near several other theme restaurants. It is across the street (Clark Street) from the Hard Rock Cafe and the Rainforest Cafe. Rock and roll exhibit Rock & Roll exhibit When the building had its Rock N Roll theme, the display of rock and roll memorabilia focused mainly on Elvis Presley in an exhibit in a separate structure on the same lot. The exhibit included a set of The Beatles statues reminiscent of their Abbey Road album cover. In December 2017, the museum underwent a two-fold renovation. It embarked on compliance with a company-wide modernization of stores to include self-order kiosks and table service. Additionally, the museum endeavored to remove its rock n roll nostalgia.

Early life and education Crawford was born in Warren County, Kentucky. He was the fourth son of John and Lucretia Crawford, who were Baptists. He had a believer's baptism at the age of sixteen.Haddock 1940 p.1 Later he said: \\"I will spend my life in telling of Jesus' great mercy.\\" He dedicated his life to mission work in China. At the beginning of 1848 he entered Union University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where his studies were supported in part by the West Tennessee Baptist Convention. He graduated in 1851 at the head of his class. Crawford worked on a farm in Denmark, Tennessee to help pay for his early education. He attended the Denmark Male Academy where he was top of his class. The Big Hatchie Baptist Association helped pay his way to Union University. The women of Browns Creek, Big Black Creek, Maple Springs and Clover Creek Baptist churches all sold their eggs and milk gathered on Sundays to help support him, and later Lottie Moon. He was first ordained by the Big Black Creek Baptist Church in Denmark, Tennessee. Brother Obediah Dodson was his pastor and very passionate about missions. Marriage and family Crawford married fellow Baptist Martha Foster. They married on March 12, 1851 at her home in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, a week after their engagement. Career At the close of 1850 Crawford was appointed as missionary to Shanghai, China by the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. Posted initially to Shanghai in 1852, Crawford and his wife Martha moved to Dengzhou in Shandong, perhaps to gain more independence from mission oversight. Crawford had a domineering character that caused much dissent; some Americans were concerned and he was rebuked by the American consul in Shanghai. Crawford insisted that preaching was the sole duty of the missionary. He was dismayed by the fiasco involving Charles Gutzlaff's Chinese evangelists. He thereafter insisted Chinese should never be paid out of mission funds. His friend Dr. George Burton's becoming exhausted due to excessive medical work in Shanghai reinforced Crawford's central conviction. Crawford itinerated widely around local villages (131 in 1875 alone). His singlemindedness meant that he closed down his wife's school in 1879, perhaps out of jealousy at her success with Lottie Moon at Shaling. He continued to criticize the mission board of the American Southern Baptist Mission, who he thought should have no say on mission matters. They disagreed and removed him in 1892. Crawford formed the Gospel Mission, and eight (of fourteen) Southern Baptist missionaries joined him. By the turn of the century, the mission had grown to nineteen. All the Gospel missioners wore Chinese clothing, lived in Chinese houses, and solely preached the gospel. This was similar to the practices of the missionaries of the China Inland Mission. Southern Baptist Convention missionaries struggled with Crawford's \\"unattractive social philosophy and his refusal to give sensible leadership to the Christian Chinese.\\" (Hyatt, 1976:59) Martha Crawford remained loyal to her husband, although she disagreed with several of his views. In 1867 she formed a boys' school in their home. Several of the students went on to become pastors at the successful Huangxian and Pingdu stations. She also wrote The Three Maidens, a book for children, which was subsequently widely used throughout China. At the Second Missionary Conference (1877), she spoke on \\"Women's Work for Women\\", stressing missionary wives should visit house-to-house, personally instruct local women, and prepare suitable literature for them. In his book The Patriarchal Dynasties, Crawford announced his conviction that in 1876 the world was 14,376 years old. He believed that the Garden of Eden was a theocratic confederacy, with a population of 1,174,405,120. See also *C.W.

The word \\"sekaten\\" itself is derived from syahadatain or shahada, the first requirement for converting into Islamic faith. Traditionally it is played once per year, on the occasion of Mawlid, Muhammad's birthday, for the week from the 6-12 of the month of Mulud (the third month of the Javanese calendar, corresponding to the Islamic Rabi' al- awwal). On this celebration it is brought from the palace at 11 pm to two pavilions before the Great Mosque. It is played every day during that week except the Thursday night/Friday morning. On the eve of the birthday proper, it is returned at 11 pm.Lindsay, Jennifer. Javanese Gamelan. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1979. . Page 46. The ensemble is said to have been created by Java's first Muslim prince,Broughton, Simon, et al., eds. World Music: The Rough Guide. London: The Rough Guides, 1994. . Page 418 or one of the Wali Sanga, in order to convert reluctant Javanese to the Islamic faith. However, it almost certainly already existed, though the music was probably used to propagate the faith.Lindsay 1979, 47. The style of the Sekaten ensemble is very loud and majestic, because it seeks to attract people to the mosque. It was said that if a saron player was able to play so hard that he broke one of the bronze keys, he would get a reward from the sultan. The gamelan sekaten includes neither singers nor the soft instruments, unlike most Javanese ensembles.Brinner, Benjamin (2008). Music in Central Java, p.11. . The ensembles are kept in the royal palaces. Two sets dating to the 16th century are found in each of the kraton in Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and two in Cirebon, one at Keraton Kasepuhan and one at Keraton Kanoman. Previously they were found in Madura and Banten as well. The names of the sets at Yogyakarta are Kyai Guntur Madu and Kyai Naga Wilaga; those at Surakarta are Kyai Guntur Madu and Kyai Guntur Sari.. According to Benjamin Brinner, the gamelan sekaten, exists in halves: divided between the two rival courts in Surakarta and Yogyakorta, each court had a matching second half made. The pitches of the Sekaten ensemble is in pelog, but lower than standard ensembles today. According to Benjamin Brinner it is the lowest pitched, largest, and loudest ensemble in Java. In recent times the gamelan at ISI Surakarta commissioned a special Sekaten set that would be compatible with their other gamelan, to be used in new experimental compositions.Roth, A. R. New Compositions for Javanese Gamelan. University of Durham, Doctoral Thesis, 1986. Page 96-97 Bonangs in the Gamelan Sekati, Yogyakarta Historically, the Sekaten ensemble is notable in the development of the gamelan because it marked the change from the use of the bonang as the most important melody instrument, as it is in the earlier Munggang and Kodokngorek ensembles, to \\"leading\\" the ensemble by playing the pitches in anticipating patterns.Roth 1986, 8. In the ensemble, players sit on opposite sides of the bonang, which may have led to the modern configuration of pots, which is aimed at making octaves comfortable.Roth 1986, 14.

The company applies vigorous physical training and the principle of an artist's autonomy to create work in an ensemble setting intimately woven with the community. The Double Edge ensemble creates performance cycles which tour internationally, including the Women's Cycle, the Song Trilogy, and the Garden of Intimacy and Desire. The Chagall Cycle, which includes The Odyssey, Shahrazad, and The Grand Parade, responds to the life, work and indomitable imagination of Russian-Jewish artist Marc Chagall, while engaging with international collaborators in music, design and dramaturgy. The Latin American Cycle (2015‚Äìpresent) is inspired by the magical realist literature and surrealist visual art and literature of South America, particularly that of Leonora Carrington and Alejandro Jodorowsky, and includes the performances Once a Blue Moon (Cada Luna Azul), The Latin American Spectacle, and Leonora and Alejandro: La Maga y el Maestro. In 1994, Double Edge moved from Boston to a 105-acre former dairy farm in rural Ashfield, MA, to create a sustainable artistic home. Today, the Farm is an International Center of Living Culture, a base for the ensemble's extensive international touring, with year-round theatre training, conversations and convenings, greening and farming initiatives, and a popular indoor/outdoor traveling spectacle which takes place alongside the hills, pastures, river, and gardens of the Center. The 2018 Summer Spectacle is We The People, a traveling performance which intersects art, culture, and democracy and has its roots in Double Edge's thirty-six year question of what makes up identity- what are the hidden territories of the land, of history, of imagination, and how do they speak to us as citizens in the present moment? Double Edge's name in part comes from the double-edged axe known as the labrys, which was used in Bacchic sacrifices in ancient Greek cult-worship. Double Edge's first production, Rites, was based on Euripides's The Bacchae.

Since 1982, when it was first developed by Klein based on her work with Rena Mirecka, Grotowski‚Äôs founding actor, DE training has grown to include work with large objects, developed by Klein and David Flaxman from 1985, and then outdoor work and spectacle developed with Carlos Uriona since 1996. Since 2011 Matthew Glassman has led the ensemble's training development. Vocal training is led by John Peitso, with Amanda Miller. The unique, holistic methodology engages the actor's full potential ‚Äì physical, vocal, emotional, and imaginative ‚Äì to drive individual exploration, ensemble collaboration, and performance creation. Double Edge Theatre offers Training Immersion and Intensive programs on-site at the Farm, as well as workshops in residence and on tour. This program is led by Jeremy Louise Eaton, Director of Student Programs. These residencies and training workshops are held at universities, and in conjunction with performances, at high schools, in other theaters, and community venues. Training programs and workshops contain the following elements: Physical training; involving a total body experience including running, partner work, and work with large objects. Although vigorous, the process allows any participant to fully engage. Improvisation; which is a combination of individual creation and group work. Improvisation allows participants to build a world of the imagination, and includes work with large objects, music, art, video, and other elements. Etudes and Presentations; created from the improvisation and individual work; scenes are created and built using music, art, video, dance, and character to create a unified piece. The goal is to translate training into devised work process.  Facilities and Farm  Pond on Double Edge's farm in Ashfield, Massachusetts. The Double Edge Theatre Farm Center is sited on a 105-acre former dairy farm in Ashfield, MA. The facility includes two performance and training spaces, production facilities, offices, archives, music room, and outdoor performance areas as well as hay fields, grazing pastures, a stream, pond, and forestland. There is also an animal barn, vegetable gardens and a high tunnel hoop house, and an additional property in the town center housing resident and emerging artists and DE's Emerging Artists Studio. Another property has been transformed into a design house, with design offices, studios, costume shop, and set, costume, and prop storage. On the Farm, the company trains, performs, runs the business of the theatre, hosts programs and guests, and grows food. A vision of future facilities includes a public archive/gallery, a meeting house space, and a fully developed farm. The preservation of the historic integrity of the buildings on the Farm has guided the process of renovation since the Double Edge ensemble moved to Ashfield, as has the shrinking of the theatre's energy footprint. At the heart of all facilities planning is the development of long- term stability and an increased capacity to accommodate creative programming and food production.

The festivities usually took place in northern alun-alun (square) in Yogyakarta, and simultaneously also celebrated in northern alun-alun of Surakarta. This ceremony originally were initiated by Sultan Hamengkubuwana I, the founder of Yogyakarta Sultanate to promote the Islamic faith. see other versions of the source -  Gamelan Sekaten  On day one, the ceremony commences after the Isya evening prayer with a royal procession of royal guards and 'abdi dalem' court officials accompanying two sets of centuries old gamelan traditional music instruments, the Kyai Nogo Wilogo and Kyai Guntur Madu. The royal procession, led by the Sultan and Governor of Yogyakarta or his representative, begins in Pendopo Ponconiti, the main hall of Kraton Yogyakarta and proceeds towards Yogyakarta Great Mosque in northern Alun-Alun. The Kyai Nogo Wilogo gamelan will be placed at the northern pavilion of Grand Mosque, while Gamelan Kyai Guntur Madu will be placed at Pagongan pavilion in southern side of the mosque. These two set of sacred gamelans will be played simultaneously everyday until the 11th day of Maulud month through seven consecutive days. During the last day the two gamelans will be returned into the Kraton. The Gamelan Sekaten of Surakarta are played in the same manner as their Yogyakarta counterparts, and are brought out to the mosque and returned to the palace in a royal procession led by the Sunan of Surakarta and the Mayor and City Council of Surakarta.  Tumplak Wajik  Two days before Grebeg Muludan, the ceremony called Tumplak Wajik was held in palace Magangan field in 4:00 PM afternoon. This ceremony is started by kotekan ceremony which incorporate singing traditional songs accompanied with rhythmic hitting of kentongan (bamboo or wooden slit drum) and lumpang (rice mortar and pestle), that marked the making of Gunungan which will be carried in Grebeg Mulud festival. The traditional Javanese kue called wajik which is diamond-shaped sticky rice in palm sugar, is an essential part of this ceremony, and included within gunungan offering. The song played in this Tumplak Wajik ceremony is usually the popular Javanese traditional songs, such as Lompong Keli, Tundhung Setan, Owal awil.  Grebeg Muludan  In Yogyakarta, the main event of Sekaten is called the Grebeg Muludan that held in 12th day (exactly during the birthday of Prophet Muhammad) starting in 8:00 am. The main Gunungan (Javanese: mountain), a model of mountain made of sticky rice, sweets, various foods, crackers, fruits and vegetables, were guarded by 10 units of bregodo (brigade) of the royal guards of the palace (the companies under His Majesty's Kraton Guard Regiment): Wirobrojo, Daeng, Patangpuluh, Jogokaryo, Prawirotomo, Nyutro, Ketanggung, Mantrijero, Surokarso, and Bugis Companies, together with the Royal Guard Battalion of the Duchy of Pakualaman. The Gunungan will be carried in processions from Kemandungan through Sitihinggil and Pagelaran hall and finally ended in Grand Mosque. After the prayer, the Gunungan that symbolize the wealth and prosperity of Mataram Sultanate will be picked, fought over and ripped apart by the people that already waiting in the square, as they believed this objects is sacred, potent and could bring good luck, prosperity and wealth upon their households. Usually these parts of Gunungan will be kept in the house for luck, or buried in the rice fields as the traditional Javanese farmers believed that these objects will grant their fields fertility and protection from locust, plagues, and any misfortunes that might befell them.

In February 2008, NJT ordered twenty-seven top speed ALP-46A locomotives from Bombardier, which were to haul Bombardier MultiLevel Coaches. The estimated value of the order was ‚Ç¨155 million (approximately $230 million). In June 2009, NJT took up an option for a further nine locomotives, and spare parts, at a cost of $72 million. On November 12, 2009, Bombardier ceremonially handed over the first two completed ALP-46As to New Jersey Transit over at their Kassel plant in Germany. They arrived on NJT property on December 13. Locomotive 4629 was shipped by rail to a testing facility in Pueblo, Colorado, while 4630 was placed on the rails at the Meadows Maintenance Complex in Kearny for testing on property and maintenance training. As of April 5, 2011, all locomotives have been delivered. As of May 7, 2011, all locomotives have entered regular revenue service. In October 2019, as part of New Jersey Transit's 40th Anniversary, locomotive No. 4636 was wrapped into a Pennsylvania Railroad scheme.https://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2019/10/08-nj-transit-provides- more-details-on-heritage-units =Future North American Clients= Commuter rail operator GO Transit is considering the use of the ALP-46 for some or all of the operator's current lines.

The system consists of a polyol-ester cooled transformer to reduce the catenary voltage which feeds two polyol-ester cooled GTO based traction converters (Bombardier MITRAC TC 3100 AC series). Each traction converter feeds the motors (Bombardier MITRAC DR 3700F series) of one truck. =ALP-46A= The ALP-46A locomotives use Bombardier's MITRAC 3000 electric propulsion system. The traction converters (Bombardier MITRAC TC 3360 AC series) are from a newer generation based on IGBT technology. The converters are water cooled and have individual inverters for each traction motor (Bombardier MITRAC DR 3700F series). Power at rail is increased to and top speed is increased to , though NJ Transit limits them to 100.

On 20 June, the British retook the South Sandwich Islands and declared hostilities to be over after removing Argentina's Southern Thule garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base. Corbeta Uruguay was established in 1976, but the Argentine base was only contested through diplomatic channels by the UK until 1982. The war lasted 74 days, with 255 British and 649 Argentine soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen, and three civilian Falklanders killed. The British Government decreed that all classified information would be available to the public in the year 2082. However, following the Freedom of Information Act, a great deal of formerly classified material is now available. The surrender document is on display at the Imperial War Museum in London.Extract from the Surrender document - IWM Retrieved 2004-03-24 As noted in the museum, the time of surrender was backdated three hours in order that both Zulu time (UTC) and the local time were recorded as 14 June even though technically it was already 15 June in London, in order to prevent possible confusion by Argentine troops who might have mistakenly thought that they were permitted to keep fighting until the next day, 15 June 1982. Relations between the UK and Argentina were not restored until 1989 and only under the umbrella formula which states that the islands sovereignty dispute will remain aside. 14 June has been a public holiday in the Falkland Islands since 1984, officially called as \\"Liberation Day\\".

While tracing its origins to the High Middle Ages, the family became prominent in the 18th century with its elevation to the rank of Counts of Nagy-Appony in 1739 and the acquisition of seventeen grand domains between 1760 and 1800. In the last century of the Habsburg Monarchy, four of its members received the Order of the Golden Fleece, a total held in a draw among the European nobility by the houses of Esterh√°zy, Batthy√°ny, and P√°lffy (4 each). In addition, Albert Apponyi received the Order in 1921 shortly after the end of the monarchy. In addition to this the Apponyi family sat within all Hungarian Kings and then Habsburg private courts which was reserved only for the most powerful and important members of the Kingdom. The family's name refers to Appony, now Oponice, a region located North of Nitra in present-day Slovakia, in which the family established itself in the late 14th century. Nagy-Appony (\\"Greater Appony\\") is the southern part of the area, which was long ruled by the Apponyi family. Many Apponyis were active in the military, politics, and/or the Catholic Church, as was customary in Hungarian aristocratic families. More distinctive of the Apponyi family was its tradition of Diplomacy for the Kingdom of Hungary then the Habsburg Monarchy, and briefly for Interwar Hungary in the significant case of Albert Apponyi. Bibliophilia was another distinguished Apponyi family tradition, the most prominent legacy of which is the Apponyi Library, now a part of the Slovak National Library and still located in the former Apponyi Castle in Oponice. Nomenclature The Apponyis, like other Hungarian magnates, juggled different languages when it came to given names. They were typically bilingual in Hungarian and German and educated in other languages as well, and went by corresponding names depending on context. Thus, the Hungarian name Apponyi Antal refers to the same individual as Anton Apponyi (German), Antoine Apponyi (French), or Antonius Apponyi (Latin) - Latin having remained widely used as a written language in Hungary well into the modern era. English-language historiography generally displays the first given name in Hungarian, but with the family name put last as customary in Europe outside of Hungary, e.g. Antal Apponyi. During Josephinism and its aftermath until around the Compromise of 1867, however, the use of Hungarian was suppressed in nobility families such as the Apponyis, and German names were more customary. From the 14th to the 18th century The Apponyis claimed ancestors among the Magyar tribes through the P√©c clan. Beyond genealogy, little is known of the family history until the Late Middle Ages. =Mikl√≥s (Nicolaus) Apponyi (late 14th/early 15th century)= In Mikl√≥s's time the family was granted the fortress of Appony (now Oponice) by King Sigismund in 1392, upon which it took up the Apponyi name. =Barons P√©ter (?-1626) and P√°l Apponyi (1564-1624)= Brothers P√©ter and P√°l were made Barons in June 1606 by King Rudolf in recognition of their fight against the Ottomans. They were signatories of the Peace of Vienna with Stephen Bocskai in the same year. They died without heirs, which meant no sons could carry on the baronial title. =Baron Bal√°zs (Blasius) Apponyi (?-1637)= Bal√°zs, a cousin of P√©ter and P√°l, inherited the Appony domain after P√©ter's death. He in turn was made a Baron by King Ferdinand II, on 12 November 1624, possibly for his literary activity and/or role in negotiations in Vienna with the supporters of Gabriel Bethlen. On 8 January 1636 Ferdinand II appointed him one of his Hungarian royal advisers. He was a distinguished writer of religious poetry in Latin. He died without male heirs, which meant the Apponyi family remained untitled until the elevation of L√°z√°r to Baron in 1718. He was buried in the monastery of Horn√© Lefantovce. =J√°nos Apponyi (early 17th century)= Apparition of Catherine of Alexandria to J√°nos Apponyi (1618) J√°nos is said to have joined the Franciscan order as a young nobleman and to have had a vision of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, in 1617 or 1618. Tradition has that he died shortly afterwards, after his family refused to acknowledge his religious vocation. In his memory, Count Krist√≥f Erd≈ëdy founded a monastery dedicated to Saint Catherine in Dejte (now Dechtice) in 1618. The monastery, today known as Katar√≠nka, was dissolved in 1786 by Joseph II but its ruined church still stands. =Count L√°z√°r Apponyi (?-1739)= L√°z√°r fought at the Siege of Buda (1686), where his father Mikl√≥s Apponyi died. He was personally raised to the hereditary rank of Baron by Charles VI in Vienna on 16 February 1718, for his outstanding military contribution to the Habsburg fights against the Ottoman Empire. Charles VI then made L√°z√°r Count of Nagy-Appony on 30 May 1739 in Laxenburg, and his descendants kept that title until the end of the monarchic period. The family's coat of arms also dates from that moment. =J√≥zsef Apponyi (1718-1787)= J√≥zsef, son of L√°z√°r, joined the Society of Jesus in Vienna in 1736, studied there and in Graz until 1741, then taught grammar in Gy≈ër (1742) and Trnava (1743). He later lectured in philosophy, logic, mathematics, physics, theology, and ethics. His Oratio de augustissimo verbi incarnati mysterio was published in Vienna in 1745. He remained a Catholic priest after the Suppression of the Society of Jesus. =Count Antal Gy√∂rgy (Anton Georg) Apponyi (1751-1817)= Antal Gy√∂rgy (or Gy√∂rgy Antal), grandson of L√°z√°r and son of Gy√∂rgy L√°szl√≥ (Georg Ladislaus) Apponyi (1736-1782), was a major cultural figure who founded the Apponyi Library. Joseph Haydn dedicated him six quartets in 1793 (No. 54 to 59, Op. 71 & 74), since known as \\"Apponyi Quartets\\". Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is also believed to have composed several pieces for him. In 1795, Antal Gy√∂rgy Apponyi invited Ludwig van Beethoven to try his hand at a string quartet, an attempt that only materialized a few years later with the Opus 18 quartets published in 1801. From 1784 he rebuilt the castle in the domain his father had purchased in H≈ëgy√©sz, and spent much of his later life there. √âberh√°rd Line Gy√∂rgy Apponyi by Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller, 1827 Gy√∂rgy (Georg) Apponyi (1780-1849), eldest son of Antal Gy√∂rgy, established himself in Eberh√°rd (now Malinovo), a castle near Pressburg (Pozsony, today's Bratislava) which had been purchased by his grandfather Gy√∂rgy and which his descendants kept until the dismemberment of the Kingdom of Hungary. Members of this branch are still alive today. =Count Gy√∂rgy (Georg) Apponyi (1808‚Äì1899)= Gy√∂rgy, son of Gy√∂rgy and grandson of Antal Gy√∂rgy, was a prominent conservative politician. He was Hungarian chancellor (1846‚Äì48) and Speaker of the Hungarian House of Magnates in 1861. =Count Albert Apponyi (1846-1933)= Albert, son of Gy√∂rgy, was a major Hungarian statesman of the conservative Party of Independence and '48. He is remembered both for his notorious 1907 legislation on the Magyarization of public education in the Kingdom of Hungary, known as Apponyi Law or Lex Apponyi, and for his brilliant (though unsuccessful) defense of Hungarian positions in the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. He received the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1921. He was also unbelievably well respected by all of the major leaders of the time, such as Theodore Roosevelt who considered him a very dear friend, along with stayed at his estate when he came to visit Budapest in 1910.

Appony Line Antal Gy√∂rgy Apponyi's second son Antal and his descendants kept custody of the ancestral family property in Oponice, where they lived until 1935. A branch of this family line held the H≈ëgy√©sz domain until 1939. =Count Antal (Anton) Apponyi (1782-1852)= Ingres (1823), Fogg Art Museum Ingres (1823), Fogg Art Museum Antal was a diplomat for the Habsburg Monarchy in Karlsruhe (Grand Duchy of Baden), Florence (Grand Duchy of Tuscany) from 1816 to 1819, and Rome (Papal States) from 1820 to 1826. In 1826 he became Ambassador in Paris, a position he held until 1848. He received the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1836. He died in the Apponyi castle on 17 October 1852. =Countess Teresa Apponyi (1790-1874)= Maria Teresa, n√©e Nogarolla in Munich of an old family originally from Verona, married Antal Apponyi in 1808. She impressed diplomats at the Congress of Vienna and gained the nickname la divine Th√©r√®se. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin dedicated her his Nocturne Op. 27 No. 1 and Op. 27 No. 2. =Count Lajos (Ludwig) Apponyi (1849-1909)= Lajos, grandson of Antal and son of Gyula Apponyi (1816-1857), was appointed Marshal of the Court in Hungary (Hofmarschall in Ungarn) by Emperor Franz Joseph in December 1895, a newly created position that entailed guardianship of the royal palaces of Budapest and G√∂d√∂ll≈ë. Among other functions, he represented the monarchy at the ceremonial reburial of King B√©la III and Queen Agnes of Antioch in Matthias Church on 21 October 1898. He was a member of the Budapest Park Club and of the Budapest Applied Art Society. =Countess Margit (Marguerite) Apponyi (1848-1931)= Marguerite, n√©e von Seherr-Thoss (de) from an ancient noble family in Silesia, married Lajos Apponyi in 1871. She was an active manager of the Appony estate and of the family's literary legacy. She ensured the publications of the memoirs of Rezs≈ë Apponyi (of the Jabl√°nc line) and of her son Henrik Apponyi. She also had the decades-long correspondence of her mother-in-law Szofia (n√©e Szt√°ray, wife of Gyula) with Charles de Montalembert edited by Fran√ßois Buloz and published in the Revue des deux Mondes in 1913. She devoted herself to philanthropy, together with her husband, especially with the hospital and school in Oponice. =Count Henrik Apponyi (1885-1935)= Henrik started a diplomatic career, in Berlin (1912-1913) and Istanbul (1913-1914), but that was cut short by World War I and the end of the Habsburg Monarchy. He relocated to Oponice in 1918 and dedicated his life to adventurous traveling, particularly in Sudan (1924) and India and Tibet (1930). His travel notes were published in London in 1937 under the title My big-game hunting diary from India and the Himalayas, with a foreword by the Viscount Halifax whom Henrik had met while in India. Sadly, the book came out after the passing away of both his mother Marguerite, who had promoted the publication project, and that of Henrik himself. He died in Berlin in unclear circumstances. Geraldine Apponyi with King Zog, 1938 =Geraldine Apponyi (1915‚Äì2002)= Geraldine was a granddaughter of Lajos and daughter of Gyula Apponyi (1873-1924) and his American wife Gladys Virginia Steuart (1891‚Äì1947). She married King Zog I of Albania in Tirana, in a grand ceremony on 27 April 1938. She reigned as Queen consort for less than a year, then spent most of her long life in exile. Lengyel line The two brothers Rezs≈ë and Gyula Apponyi inherited Lengyel Castle in 1863 from their uncle J√≥zsef Apponyi (1788-1863), third son of Antal Gy√∂rgy. Rezs≈ë took over Lengyel while Gyula stayed in Appony (Oponice). Members of this branch lived in Lengyel until 1930. =Count Rezs≈ë (Rudolf) Apponyi (1812-1876)= Rudolf, son of Antal, was a diplomat, initially in Paris and Saint Petersburg where he married in 1843, with Emperor Nicholas I and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna both attending. He later served in Karlsruhe (1847-1849), Turin (1849-1853), Munich (1853-1856), London (1856-1871, from 1860 as Ambassador), and Paris (Ambassador, 1871-1876). He received the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1865. In 1866 he contracted the sublease of the Habsburg Embassy in London on Belgrave Square, where the Embassy of Austria remains to this day.

He left that service in 1876 to devote himself to bibliophilia. He received the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1907. Bust of S√°ndor Apponyi in front of Lengyel Castle Other members of the Apponyi family =Jabl√°nc line= The brothers P√°l and J√°nos Apponyi (not descendants of L√°z√°r, thus not counts) together inherited the castle in Jabl√°nc (German Jablonitz or Apfelsdorf, formerly also Jabloncza or Jablonicz in Hungarian, now Jablonica in Slovakia) in 1772. In 1784 it was reconstructed and went to P√°l, while J√°nos stayed in Appony (Oponice). After P√°l's death it went to his son J√≥zsef (Joseph) Apponyi (1784-1853), who was made a Count by Emperor Francis I in April 1808. Members of this branch stayed in Jabl√°nc until the aftermath of World War I, after which it changed hands . J√≥zsef's son Rezs≈ë (more often referred to as Rudolf, sometimes Rudolf II to distinguish him from his relative of the Lengyel line; 1802-1853) served as a junior diplomat (attach√©) in Paris from 1826 to 1850, hired by the Habsburg Monarchy's ambassador his distant uncle Antal. Long after his death, his notes from this period, which had been kept in the family library, were edited in Paris by Ernest Daudet at the instigation of Count Lajos Apponyi's wife Marguerite, and published by Plon in four volumes between 1913 and 1926 as Journal du Comte Rodolphe Apponyi. =Silvio Apponyi (1949-)= Silvio Apponyi is a renowned Australian sculptor, born 1949 in a refugee camp near Munich. His father Albert Friedrich Apponyi, who descended from an illegitimate line of the family, was allowed to use the family name after emigrating to Australia. Apponyi properties Over the years the Apponyis built or acquired numerous properties in the Kingdom of Hungary and in Vienna. At the peak they had around 30 properties to their name over the empire. Several of these still stand. =Appony (today Oponice, Slovakia)= The Apponyi fortress probably already existed in the time of Great Moravia and was acquired by the Apponyis in 1392. In 1645 it was badly damaged by fire and was finally destroyed by the Habsburg army in 1708 after it had been used by Kuruc rebels during R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence. The Apponyi Castle was built in stages from the 16th century and used as one of the family's many residences from the mid-17th century to 1935. It underwent extensive renovation in 2007-2011 and has since operated as a luxury hotel, branded Chateau-Appony, with the library wing of 1846 again hosting the Apponyi Library.

It was reconstructed into its current form sometime after 1817 by Count Gy√∂rgy Apponyi (1780-1849), eldest son of Antal Gy√∂rgy. It then went to his son Gy√∂rgy Apponyi who died in the castle in 1899. Albert Apponyi lost property of the castle following the Treaty of Trianon. It became an agricultural school in 1923, a function it still serves despite an obvious need for repair. =Jabl√°nc (today Jablonica, Slovakia)= The castle in Jabloncza, inherited by the family in 1772, was remodeled by J√≥zsef Apponyi around the time of his elevation as Count in 1808, possibly to better reflect his new higher status. It was again remodeled in the late 19th century by Count Antal Apponyi (1852-1920), who inherited it from J√≥zsef's son Rezs≈ë Apponyi. After World War I it changed hands several times and eventually went into disrepair. In 2017 it was purchased by a non-profit group that intends to renovate it and convert into a hotel and cultural facility. =H≈ëgy√©sz (Hungary)= Apponyi Castle, H≈ëgy√©sz The H≈ëgy√©sz domain in Tolna County was acquired in 1722 by Count Claude Florimond de Mercy, and purchased by Gy√∂rgy Apponyi (son of L√°z√°r) in 1772. It was rebuilt in the late 18th century by Gy√∂rgy's son, Count Antal Gy√∂rgy Apponyi, who spent much of the rest of his life there. The castle later went to Antal George's grandson K√°roly Apponyi (1805-1890), his son G√©za (1853-1927) and the latter's son K√°roly (1878-1959) who sold it to the Hungarian state in 1939. During and after World War II it became a center for displaced people and military hospital, and later a school. It was privatized in 1999 and renovated into a luxury hotel, but was embroiled in the troubles of controversial financier Ghaith Pharaon which led to its closing in the 2010s. =Lengyel (Hungary)= Apponyi Castle, Lengyel The Swabian village of Lengyel (\\"Polish\\" in Hungarian) in Tolna County was purchased by Count Antal Gy√∂rgy Apponyi in 1799. The castle was built by Antal Gy√∂rgy's third son J√≥zsef in 1824-1829 and extensively remodeled from 1878 by S√°ndor Apponyi. It suffered fire damage in 1905. After S√°ndor's passing away, his widow Countess Alexandra Esterh√°zy donated the castle in 1926 to the Hungarian National Museum but kept the privilege of living there until her death in 1930. During World War II it was used by Hungary's National Cartography Office, then became a Russian military hospital from January to March 1945, and later that year an internment camp for displaced Germans. It has been an agricultural school since 1946. =Urban properties= The Apponyis inhabited various properties in the capitals cities of Vienna, Pressburg (Pozsony, today's Bratislava) and Budapest, many of which were rented. The Apponyi Palace in Bratislava, built by Count Gy√∂rgy Apponyi (1736-1782), was sold in 1865 to the municipality of Pressburg. The Palais Apponyi in Vienna was built in 1880 for Marguerite and Lajos Apponyi. Albert Apponyi lived in an old house on Castle Hill in Budapest, now T√°ncsics Mih√°ly utca 17, where a plaque honors his memory and that of his son Gy√∂rgy. =Other= * The medieval castle in Csekl√©sz (ƒåekl√≠s in Slovak, near Bernol√°kovo, Slovakia) was held by the family before they switched it for the Appony domain in 1392. It has been ruined since the 16th century. * A branch of the Apponyi family inherited the castle in the village of Korl√°tk≈ë (now Cerov√°, Slovakia), following the extinction of the Korlathke≈ëy family in 1546. That \\"Korl√°tk≈ë line\\" of the family ended with the 1637 death of Baron Bal√°zs Apponyi without male heirs. * Some time after 1580 Bal√°zs Apponyi built a castle in L√©szk√≥ (now Lieskov√© in Cerov√°, Slovakia), as the old Korl√°tk≈ë castle was no longer suitable for the lifestyle of his time. His widow Borb√°la remained there after his death, but the Apponyi family subsequently no longer owned it. It is now a Catholic charity home. * Bal√°zs Apponyi also owned a castle in Pereszl√©ny (now Preseƒæany, Slovakia), now destroyed. * The now- destroyed castle in B√°nov (Czechia), despite being in Moravia and not in the Kingdom of Hungary, was acquired by Bal√°zs Apponyi in 1630 and stayed in the family's property until 1658. * The Appony line of the family owned the village castle in Kovarce () (today in Slovakia) from 1876 to 1926. * A roadside mansion in B√°taap√°ti in Tolna County (Hungary), was built by the Apponyis in the 1840s and renovated in 2005‚Äì2006. * A manor in Medina (Tolna County), built in 1840 and purchased by the Apponyis in 1850, has been renovated as a hotel branded Apponyi Kiskast√©ly (Little Castle of Apponyi). * A manor in P√°lfa (Tolna County) was built in 1924-1928 by G√©za Apponyi (1853-1927) and his son K√°roly (1878-1959), who died there. G√©za was the son of K√°roly Apponyi, eldest son of Count Antal Apponyi's eldest son Gy√∂rgy (of the Malinovo line). The domain of P√°lfa was apparently acquired by the family in 1772 together with H≈ëgy√©sz. The building now serves as a home for disabled people. * There are many, many other properties that the Apponyi family supposedly owned during their time within the Kingdom but also all over Europe Image: Aponiho pal√°c 3.jpgApponyi Palace, Bratislava Image: Palais Apponyi.JPGPalais Apponyi, Vienna Image: Zrucaniny a veza.jpgSite of Csekl√©sz castle Image: Korl√°tka 02.jpgRuins of Korl√°tka castle Image: B√°nov, t≈ôi k≈ô√≠≈æe.jpgSite of B√°nov castle Image: Apponyi k√∫ria.JPGApponyi mansion, B√°taap√°ti Image: Medina - Palace.jpgApponyi manor, Medina Bibliophilia The Apponyi Library (Bibliotheca Apponiana) was created around 1774 by Count Anton Gy√∂rgy Apponyi in Vienna, who took advantage for its build-up of the abolition of the monasteries by Joseph II. In 1827 it was moved to Pressburg in a dedicated building on Kozia Street (sk), and on to Appony in 1846. It was partly dispersed in stages from the late 19th century to the eve of World War II, and what was left in Apponyi Castle deteriorated during the Communist era. It was restored in the early 21st century and reopened in 2011 as part of the Slovak National Library. Count S√°ndor Apponyi's extensive collection of books and incunables was kept at Lengyel Castle. This included a collection of Hungary-related prints or Hungarica, and a separate collection of items he called rariora et curiosa, mostly in French, Latin and Italian. Part of the latter collection was specifically dedicated to the history of Verona and the local Nogarol[l]a family from which his grandmother (Antal's wife Teresa) stemmed, including the late medieval humanist Isotta Nogarola. S√°ndor donated the whole collection to Hungary's National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library in 1926. A special law adopted in 1926 by the Hungarian National Assembly to acknowledge the donation of the collection mentions several other comparable donations, but adds that \\"Among all these generous, valuable donations, that of Count [S√°ndor] Apponyi is by far the most important.\\" See also * Oponice () * List of titled noble families in the Kingdom of Hungary References Category:Hungarian-language surnames Category:Hungarian noble families ","title":"Apponyi family"},{"id":"8873886","text":"\\"But What a Sweet Little Room\\" is the thirteenth episode of the 1969 ITC British television series Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) starring Mike Pratt, Kenneth Cope and Annette Andre. The episode was first broadcast on 14 December 1969 on the ITV. Directed by Roy Ward Baker. Synopsis Jeff investigates the disappearance of a wealthy young woman's aunt. When she too is killed he is led to the regular meetings of a medium, Madame Hanska, and uses Jeannie as a decoy to foil a thieving operation in which a gang of three middle-class men murder and rob rich middle-aged widows by taking them on an apparently innocent excursion to a cottage in the county. Overview In this episode Marty contacts a phoney psychic medium who claims to be able to contact the dead husbands and wives of well-heeled middle-aged widows and widowers. To the fake medium's extreme surprise he is then able to materialise as a ghost in front of her (the first real ghost she has ever seen in her long career) and gets her to confess to receiving money from the gang of three middle-class men in return for setting up s√©ances at which they target wealthy widows and lure them to their deaths. She shows a genuine sense of fear and remorse over her wrongdoing when confronted by Marty the ghost. This is a particularly macabre episode (very different from the almost slapstick comedic atmosphere of The Ghost of Monte Carlo) with the sudden unexpected grisly death of the widow in an airtight room, initially masquerading as a delightful cottage drawing room or study (the room that gives its name to the episode title), shown in graphic detail at the start of the program. Only later on in the episode does it become clear why such a bizarre and elaborate means of murdering the widows has been constructed by the scriptwriters when Jeff is also nearly gassed to death in the same room only to be saved at the last moment with Marty's usual spiritual assistance.

Career A Centre Forward as a schoolboy, he transferred into the role of goalkeeper after deputising for an injured teammate during a school match. Downsborough made his League debut for his local side Halifax Town just before his 17th birthday and went on to play in 148 games in total before being signed for Swindon Town by Danny Williams. He made his Swindon debut in the first game of the 1965/66 season, keeping a clean sheet against local rivals Oxford United at the County Ground. His confidence in his abilities and great positional strength were his most admirable qualities. With his assistance, Swindon made it to the 1969 League Cup Final against Arsenal at Wembley Stadium. Widely regarded by players and press as his finest moment, Downsborough pulled off save after save and prevented the higher division club from scoring for 86 minutes. > \\"for quarter of an hour it was Downsborough versus Arsenal and Downsborough > won.\\" Geoffrey Green - The Times > \\"During the 90 minutes even the most die-hard Swindon fans would have agreed > we deserved an equaliser, We hit the woodwork and Peter Downsborough was > just unbelievable. I had quite a lot of saves to make but not like he had.\\" > Bob Wilson - Arsenal goalkeeper > \\"Downsborough was absolutely unbelievable that day and saved just about > everything we threw at him.\\" Frank McLintock - Arsenal centre-half > \\"On the occasions they did find gaps in the Town rearguard, their efforts > were not good enough to beat goalkeeper Downsborough, who was in superb > form. Time and again he leapt out to punch away dangerous corner kicks, and > two of his saves from direct shots were breathtaking\\" Clive King - Swindon > Advertiser An error in the 86th minute of the game saw Arsenal equalise through a Bobby Gould header, Downsborough attempted to clear the ball from the edge of the penalty area only to kick it against the Arsenal player and launch the ball into the air. Gould calmly followed the ball's progress and scored easily. > \\"It was my fault. I take the blame for it. I started to come off my line and > then stopped. As the ball came to me I was late on it and kicked it straight > at Bobby's foot. I was on the floor, the ball rebounded over my head and > left Bobby with an easy header into the empty net. I remember wishing that > the ground would open up and swallow me. I thought to myself that the one > mistake could have cost us the League Cup. After all that hard work in 90 > minutes of football it could have been my one moment of madness that cost > Swindon the trophy. I could not believe that I had done a thing like that.\\" > Peter Downsborough Swindon beat Arsenal against the odds in extra time and Downsborough was voted Town Player of the Year by the supporters. He asked to be placed on the transfer list in 1972 believing that players such as himself who had been at the club a long time were not being rewarded as well as newcomers. Current manager Les Allen dropped him from the team as a result and eventually loaned out to Brighton and Hove Albion for 3 games, he returned to Swindon team for the final 13 games of the 1972/73 season to help the side avoid relegation. He was transferred to Bradford City before the start of the 1973/74 season and made 225 appearances before retiring in 1978. He kept a clean-sheet in his final game for the club, a 6‚Äì0 victory against Crewe Alexandra. In 1999, he had returned to his home town of Halifax and was working as a school caretaker. He died on 26 September 2019 at the age of 76. On 12 October 2019, before a League Two matchup between Swindon and Plymouth Argyle, there was a minute-long tribute to Downsborough.

Today there are nearly 2,000 Oxford Houses in the United States and other countries. Each house is based on three rules: *No use of drugs or alcohol and no disruption *The house must be run democratically *Pay the Equal Expense Shared (EES) cost or any fines Equal Expense Shared (EES) is generally between 80 and 160 dollars a week and includes utilities. A certain number of AA meetings a week may be mandatory. Weekly business meetings are mandatory to discuss any issues that the house may be facing. It is at these meetings that checks are written for bills and residents are made aware of where they stand financially. The first Oxford House was opened in Silver Spring, Maryland in 1975 by Paul Molloy. Molloy had been a Senate committee staff member between 1967 and 1972. He sought treatment for his alcoholism in a halfway house in 1975. Later that year, the halfway house would close due to financial difficulty, and Molloy and the other residents took over the lease. They chose the name Oxford House in recognition of Oxford Group, a religious organization that influenced the founders of AA.  Oxford House information  * The goal is the provision of housing and rehabilitative support for the alcoholic or drug addict who wants to stop drinking or using and stay stopped. * All houses are run on a democratic basis. Officers serve periods of no longer than six months in any one office. * No member of an Oxford House is asked to leave without cause following the 30-day probationary period‚Äîa dismissal vote by the membership because of drinking, drug use, or disruptive behavior. * Oxford House is not affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, organizationally or financially, but Oxford House members realize that only active participation in Alcoholics Anonymous and/or Narcotics Anonymous offers assurance of continued sobriety. * Each Oxford House is autonomous except in matters affecting other houses or Oxford House, Inc., as a whole. * Each house is financially self-supporting although financially secure houses may provide new or financially needy houses a loan for a term not exceeding one year. * Members who leave an Oxford House in good standing are encouraged to become associate members and offer friendship, support, and example to newer members.  Business meetings  Business meetings are the core of Oxford House. All decisions are made based upon a vote by all members of the house. A typical Oxford House has five positions, however each person still has only one vote. These positions are: *The President calls the meeting to order, directs the meeting, moderates discussion, and closes the meeting. *The Treasurer is responsible for keeping a financial accounting for all matters involving the house. This includes the house's current resources and any bills that must be paid. *The Comptroller keeps an account of the amount of money each person owes to the house each week.

DePaul University Research on Oxford House  DePaul University's Center for Community Research, led by Dr. Leonard A. Jason, has been involved in a research study of Oxford House since 1988. It was found that the characteristics of people living in an Oxford House did not vary significantly from people in other substance abuse programs. The primary reason cited for moving into an Oxford House was companionship and the enforcement of a sober living environment. Approximately three quarters of the residents involved in the study were involved with the Alcoholics Anonymous program. The average stay was about 175 days, and over a two-year period 69% of those interviewed self-reported that they stayed in the house or left on good terms. The paper stated that: * These findings suggest that the Oxford House model, in comparison to those who solely attend twelve-step programs, might be more effective in empowering residents in their ongoing abstinence in a way that enhances the perception of control in their lives.

The Literary Encyclopedia. 20 August 2009. was a South African short-story writer. Early life Temba was born in Marabastad, near Pretoria, but wrote most of his work in Sophiatown, Johannesburg, South Africa. The town was destroyed under the provisions of the apartheid Group Areas Act, which reassigned ethnic groups to new areas. He was a student at Fort Hare University College, where he received an English degree (first- class) and a teacher's diploma. After moving to Sophiatown, he tried his hand at short-story writing. Temba entered the first short story contest of Drum (a magazine for urban black people concentrating mainly on investigative journalism), which he won. He subsequently worked for Drum, where he became one of the \\"Drum Boys,\\" together with Henry Nxumalo, Bloke Modisane, Todd Matshikiza, Stan Motjuwadi and Casey Motsisi. They were later joined by Lewis Nkosi and Nat Nakasa. This group lived by the dictum: \\"Live fast, die young and have a good-looking corpse.\\" Part of Drum's ethos was investigative journalism. One of the aims was to show the realities and inequities of apartheid. Themba decided to see how white churches would react to his attending services. Migration to Swaziland Growing frustrations with the restrictions of apartheid, caused him to move to Swaziland where he worked as a teacher. In 1966, he was declared a \\"statutory communist\\", as a result of which his works were banned in South Africa. His literary output was only readily available in the 1980s with the publication of two collections The Will to Die (1972) and The World of Can Themba (1985). In his stories, he described the frustrations of the university-educated urban black people; unavailable to realise their true potential because of the racial restrictions of apartheid and trying to balance their modern urban culture with the historical rural tribal one. His most famous story \\"The Suit\\" tells the story of Philemon, a middle-class lawyer, and his wife, Matilda, who live in Sophiatown. One day, Philemon hears that his wife is having an affair, so he goes home in the middle of the day and catches her in flagrante. Her lover jumps out of the window but leaves behind his suit. Philemon then dreams up a strange and bizarre punishment. Matilda has to treat the suit as an honoured guest, feed it, entertain it and take it out for walks. This serves as a constant reminder of her adultery. A remorseful Matilda eventually dies of humiliation. Philemon then regrets his actions but it is all too late. (A stage version of \\"The Suit\\" was created by Mothobi Mutloatse and Barney Simon at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg in the early 1990s, and was subsequently translated into French (Le Costume) by Barney Simon and Jean-Claude Carri√®re for a production by Peter Brook in Paris in 1994, and London in 2012.) Themba's increasing dependency on alcohol led to darker, introspective pieces such as Crepuscle, The Will to Die, and The Bottom of the Bottle. Death He died of Coronary thrombosis in his flat in Manzini on 8 September 1967 .

He is considered one of Canada‚Äôs greatest exploring scientists, having named over 3,000 geographical features. Personal life Robert Bell was born in Toronto, Upper Canada to Presbyterian clergy and amateur geologist, Reverend Andrew Bell and Elizabeth Notman. In 1873, Bell married Agnes Smith. They had a son and three daughters. He spent his retirement at his home in Ottawa and his farm in Rathwell, Manitoba. Bell died after a brief illness at the age of 76 at his farm. Early beginnings In 1856, at the age of 15 years old, Bell worked as a summer assistant to William Edmond Logan with the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). Even as he started postsecondary education, he continued to work summers with the GSC, heading his own survey party in 1859. Bell attended McGill University, Montreal, and studied under John William Dawson. In 1861, Bell earned a civil engineering degree with the Governor General‚Äôs Medal. He went on to study for two years at the University of Edinburgh. In 1878, he earned a medical degree from McGill University. Career In 1863, Bell became a chemistry and natural sciences professor at Queen‚Äôs College in Kingston, Ontario. He continued to do fieldwork for the GSC over the summers. In 1867, he left Queen‚Äôs to join the GSC full-time. In 1869, the GSC made Bell a permanent officer, and he spent the rest of his career there. He was promoted to Assistant Director (1877), Chief Geologist (1890), then Acting Director (1901-1906). He was saddened that he was never appointed Director of the Survey. In November 1908, Bell retired. During his 52-year career at the GSC, Bell led many extensive explorations in northern Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, the eastern Arctic, Saskatchewan prairies and the Athabasca oil sands. He is credited with mapping the rivers between Hudson Bay and Lake Superior. As was the case with all GSC geologists of the time, Bell collected specimens and made notes on geology, flora and fauna, indigenous populations, climate and soil and exploitable resources. His GSC colleagues dubbed him the father of Canadian place-names because he is credited with naming over 3,000 geographical features in Canada. Bell wrote over 200 reports and papers, mostly on geology, biology, geography and ethnology. During his lifetime, he saw his extensive body of fieldwork put to a significant purpose. The planners of the third trans-continental railway, the Grand Trunk Pacific, were able to use the vast compendium of information in Bell's reports as the preliminary reconnaissance work required to plan the track route from Quebec to Winnipeg. Private library Bell assembled a private library estimated to contain 26 tons of books and artifacts to support his life‚Äôs work. The collection contained rock specimens and hundreds of books on various subjects ranging from natural history texts, medical texts, geological reports, native language and culture texts and books on the exploration of North America. It also contained research and professional periodicals, several Canadian newspapers and several hundred reprints of scientific and professional reports from other researchers. On October 28, 1962, some of this collection was damaged or destroyed in a fire in Ottawa. Subsequently, the surviving collection was dispersed to family, private collectors and institutions. Some of his archives are held at McGill University in the Osler Library of the History of Medicine but the majority went to the National Archives of Canada.

In molecular biology, LSm proteins are a family of RNA-binding proteins found in virtually every cellular organism. LSm is a contraction of 'like Sm', because the first identified members of the LSm protein family were the Sm proteins. LSm proteins are defined by a characteristic three-dimensional structure and their assembly into rings of six or seven individual LSm protein molecules, and play a large number of various roles in mRNA processing and regulation. The Sm proteins were first discovered as antigens targeted by so-called anti- Sm antibodies in a patient with a form of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a debilitating autoimmune disease. They were named Sm proteins in honor of Stephanie Smith, a patient who suffered from SLE. Other proteins with very similar structures were subsequently discovered and named LSm proteins. New members of the LSm protein family continue to be identified and reported. Proteins with similar structures are grouped into a hierarchy of protein families, superfamilies, and folds. The LSm protein structure is an example of a small beta sheet folded into a short barrel. Individual LSm proteins assemble into a six or seven member doughnut ring (more properly termed a torus), which usually binds to a small RNA molecule to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. The LSm torus assists the RNA molecule to assume and maintain its proper three-dimensional structure. Depending on which LSm proteins and RNA molecule are involved, this ribonucleoprotein complex facilitates a wide variety of RNA processing including degradation, editing, splicing, and regulation. Alternate terms for LSm family are LSm fold and Sm- like fold, and alternate capitalization styles such as lsm, LSM, and Lsm are common and equally acceptable.  History  = Discovery of the Smith antigen = The story of the discovery of the first LSm proteins begins with a young woman, Stephanie Smith, who was diagnosed in 1959 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), eventually succumbing to complications of the disease in 1969 at the age of 22. During this period, she was treated at New York's Rockefeller University Hospital, under the care of Dr. Henry Kunkel and Dr. Eng Tan. As those with an autoimmune disease, SLE patients produce antibodies to antigens in their cells' nuclei, most frequently to their own DNA. However, Dr. Kunkel and Dr. Tan found in 1966 that Ms. Smith produced antibodies to a set of nuclear proteins, which they named the 'smith antigen' (Sm Ag). About 30% of SLE patients produce antibodies to these proteins, as opposed to double stranded DNA. This discovery improved diagnostic testing for SLE, but the nature and function of this antigen was unknown. = Sm proteins, snRNPs, the spliceosome and messenger RNA splicing = Research continued during the 1970s and early 1980s. The smith antigen was found to be a complex of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules and multiple proteins. A set of uridine-rich small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules was part of this complex, and given the names U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6. Four of these snRNAs (U1, U2, U4 and U5) were found to be tightly bound to several small proteins, which were named SmB, SmD, SmE, SmF, and SmG in decreasing order of size. SmB has an alternatively spliced variant, SmB', and a very similar protein, SmN, replaces SmB'/B in certain (mostly neural) tissues. SmD was later discovered to be a mixture of three proteins, which were named SmD1, SmD2 and SmD3. These nine proteins (SmB, SmB', SmN, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF and SmG) became known as the Sm core proteins, or simply Sm proteins. The snRNAs are complexed with the Sm core proteins and with other proteins to form particles in the cell's nucleus called small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, or snRNPs. By the mid 1980s, it became clear that these snRNPs help form a large (4.8 MD molecular weight) complex, called the spliceosome, around pre-mRNA, excising portions of the pre-mRNA called introns and splicing the coding portions (exons) together. After a few more modifications, the spliced pre-mRNA becomes messenger RNA (mRNA) which is then exported from the nucleus and translated into a protein by ribosomes. = Discovery of proteins similar to the Sm proteins = The snRNA U6 (unlike U1, U2, U4 and U5) does not associate with the Sm proteins, even though the U6 snRNP is a central component in the spliceosome. In 1999 a protein heteromer was found that binds specifically to U6, and consisted of seven proteins clearly homologous to the Sm proteins. These proteins were denoted LSm (like Sm) proteins (LSm1, LSm2, LSm3, LSm4, LSm5, LSm6 and LSm7), with the similar LSm8 protein identified later. In the bacterium Escherichia coli, the Sm-like protein HF-I encoded by the gene hfq was described in 1968 as an essential host factor for RNA bacteriophage QŒ≤ replication. The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's Yeast) was sequenced in the mid-1990s, providing a rich resource for identifying homologs of these human proteins. Subsequently, as more eukaryotes genomes were sequenced, it became clear that eukaryotes, in general, share homologs to the same set of seven Sm and eight LSm proteins. Soon after, proteins homologous to these eukaryote LSm proteins were found in Archaea (Sm1 and Sm2) and Bacteria (Hfq and YlxS homologs). The archaeal LSm proteins are more similar to the eukaryote LSm proteins than either are to bacterial LSm proteins. The LSm proteins described thus far were rather small proteins, varying from 76 amino acids (8.7 kD molecular weight) for human SmG to 231 amino acids (29 kD molecular weight) for human SmB. But recently, larger proteins have been discovered that include a LSm structural domain in addition to other protein structural domains (such as LSm10, LSm11, LSm12, LSm13, LSm14, LSm15, LSm16, ataxin-2, as well as archaeal Sm3). = Discovery of the LSm fold = Around 1995, comparisons between the various LSm homologs identified two sequence motifs, 32 nucleic acids long (14 amino acids), that were very similar in each LSm homolog, and were separated by a non-conserved region of variable length. This indicated the importance of these two sequence motifs (named Sm1 and Sm2), and suggested that all LSm protein genes evolved from a single ancestral gene. In 1999, crystals of recombinant Sm proteins were prepared, allowing X-ray crystallography and determination of their atomic structure in three dimensions. This demonstrated that the LSm proteins share a similar three-dimensional fold of a short alpha helix and a five-stranded folded beta sheet, subsequently named the LSm fold. Other investigations found that LSm proteins assemble into a torus (doughnut- shaped ring) of six or seven LSm proteins, and that RNA binds to the inside of the torus, with one nucleotide bound to each LSm protein.

(The beta sheet fold hinge runs along the bottom of the image.) Uridine phosphate binds in archaeal Sm1 between the Œ≤2b/Œ≤3a loop and Œ≤4b/Œ≤5 loop. The uracil is stacked between the histidine and arginine residues, stabilized by hydrogen bonding to an asparagine residue, and hydrogen bonding between the aspartate residue and the ribose. LSm proteins are characterized by a beta sheet (the secondary structure), folded into the LSm fold (the tertiary structure), polymerization into a six or seven member torus (the quaternary structure), and binding to RNA oligonucleotides.National Center for Biotechnology Information Structure Database PDB codes 1B34, 1D3B, 1I5L, 1KQ2, 1N9S, 1IB8. A modern paradigm classifies proteins on the basis of protein structure and is a currently active field, with three major approaches, SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins), CATH (Class, Architecture, Topology, Homologous superfamily), and FSSP/DALI (Families of Structurally Similar Proteins). = Secondary = The secondary structure of a LSm protein is a small five-strand anti-parallel beta sheet, with the strands identified from the N-terminal end to the C-terminal end as Œ≤1, Œ≤2, Œ≤3, Œ≤4, Œ≤5. The SCOP class of All beta proteins and the CATH class of Mainly Beta are defined as protein structures that are primarily beta sheets, thus including LSm. The SM1 sequence motif corresponds to the Œ≤1, Œ≤2, Œ≤3 strands, and the SM2 sequence motif corresponds to the Œ≤4 and Œ≤5 strands. The first four beta strands are adjacent to each other, but Œ≤5 is adjacent to Œ≤1, turning the overall structure into a short barrel. This structural topology is described as 51234. A short (two to four turns) N-terminal alpha helix is also present in most LSm proteins. The Œ≤3 and Œ≤4 strands are short in some LSm proteins, and are separated by an unstructured coil of variable length. The Œ≤2, Œ≤3 and Œ≤4 strands are strongly bent about 120¬∞ degrees at their midpoints The bends in these strands are often glycine, and the side chains internal to the beta barrel are often the hydrophobic residues valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine. = Tertiary = SCOP simply classifies the LSm structure as the Sm-like fold, one of 149 different Beta Protein folds, without any intermediate groupings. The LSm beta sheet is sharply bent and described as a Roll architecture in CATH (one of 20 different beta protein architectures in CATH). One of the beta strands (Œ≤5 in LSm) crosses the open edge of the roll to form a small SH3 type barrel topology (one of 33 beta roll topologies in CATH). CATH lists 23 homologous superfamilies with an SH3 type barrel topology, one of which is the LSm structure (RNA Binding Protein in the CATH system). SCOP continues its structural classification after Fold to Superfamily, Family and Domain, while CATH continues to Sequence Family, but these divisions are more appropriately described in the \\"Evolution and phylogeny\\" section. The SH3-type barrel tertiary structure of the LSm fold is formed by the strongly bent (about 120¬∞) Œ≤2, Œ≤3 and Œ≤4 strands, with the barrel structure closed by the Œ≤5 strand. Emphasizing the tertiary structure, each bent beta strand can be described as two shorter beta strands. The LSm fold can be viewed as an eight-strand anti-parallel beta sandwich, with five strands in one plane and three strands in a parallel plane with about a 45¬∞ pitch angle between the two halves of the beta sandwich. The short (two to four turns) N-terminal alpha helix occurs at one edge of the beta sandwich. This alpha helix and the beta strands can be labeled (from the N-terminus to the C-terminus) Œ±, Œ≤1, Œ≤2a, Œ≤2b, Œ≤3a, Œ≤3b, Œ≤4a, Œ≤4b, Œ≤5 where the a and b refer to either the two halves of a bent strand in the five-strand description, or to the individual strands in the eight-strand description. Each strand (in the eight-strand description) is formed from five amino acid residues. Including the bends and loops between the strands, and the alpha helix, about 60 amino acid residues contribute to the LSm fold, but this varies between homologs due to variation in inter-strand loops, the alpha helix, and even the lengths of Œ≤3b and Œ≤4a strands. = Quaternary = LSm proteins typically assemble into a LSm ring, a six or seven member torus, about 7 nanometers in diameter with a 2 nanometer hole. The ancestral condition is a homohexamer or homoheptamer of identical LSm subunits. LSm proteins in eukaryotes form heteroheptamers of seven different LSm subunits, such as the Sm proteins. Binding between the LSm proteins is best understood with the eight-strand description of the LSm fold. The five-strand half of the beta sandwich of one subunit aligns with the three-strand half of the beta sandwich of the adjacent subunit, forming a twisted 8-strand beta sheet AŒ≤4a/AŒ≤3b/AŒ≤2a/AŒ≤1/AŒ≤5/BŒ≤4b/BŒ≤3a/BŒ≤2b, where the A and B refer to the two different subunits. In addition to hydrogen bonding between the AŒ≤5 and BŒ≤4b beta strands of the two LSm protein subunits, there are energetically favorable contacts between hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the interior of the contact area, and energetically favorable contacts between hydrophilic amino acid side chains around the periphery of the contact area. = RNA oligonucleotide binding = LSm rings form ribonucleoprotein complexes with RNA oligonucleotides that vary in binding strength from very stable complexes (such as the Sm class snRNPs) to transient complexes. RNA oligonucleotides generally bind inside the hole (lumen) of the LSm torus, one nucleotide per LSm subunit, but additional nucleotide binding sites have been reported at the top (Œ± helix side) of the ring. The exact chemical nature of this binding varies, but common motifs include stacking the heterocyclic base (often uracil) between planar side chains of two amino acids, hydrogen bonding to the heterocyclic base and/or the ribose, and salt bridges to the phosphate group.  Functions  The various kinds of LSm rings function as scaffolds or chaperones for RNA oligonucleotides, assisting the RNA to assume and maintain the proper three-dimensional structure. In some cases, this allows the oligonucleotide RNA to function catalytically as a ribozyme. In other cases, this facilitates modification or degradation of the RNA, or the assembly, storage, and intracellular transport of ribonucleoprotein complexes. = Sm ring = The Sm ring is found in the nucleus of all eukaryotes (about 2.5 x 106 copies per proliferating human cell), and has the best understood functions. The Sm ring is a heteroheptamer. The Sm-class snRNA molecule (in the 5' to 3' direction) enters the lumen (doughnut hole) at the SmE subunit and proceeds sequentially in a clockwise fashion (looking from the Œ± helix side) inside the lumen (doughnut hole) to the SmG, SmD3, SmB, SmD1, SmD2 subunits, exiting at the SmF subunit. (SmB can be replaced by the splice variant SmB' and by SmN in neural tissues.) The Sm ring permanently binds to the U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs which form four of the five snRNPs that constitute the major spliceosome. The Sm ring also permanently binds to the U11, U12 and U4atac snRNAs which form four of the five snRNPs (including the U5 snRNP) that constitute the minor spliceosome. Both of these spliceosomes are central RNA-processing complexes in the maturation of messenger RNA from pre-mRNA. Sm proteins have also been reported to be part of ribonucleoprotein component of telomerase. = Lsm2-8 ring = The two Lsm2-8 snRNPs (U6 and U6atac) have the key catalytic function in the major and minor spliceosomes. These snRNPs do not include the Sm ring, but instead use the heteroheptameric Lsm2-8 ring. The LSm rings are about 20 times less abundant than the Sm rings. The order of these seven LSm proteins in this ring is not known, but based on amino acid sequence homology with the Sm proteins, it is speculated that the snRNA (in the 5' to 3' direction) may bind first to LSm5, and precedes sequentially clockwise to the LSm7, LSm4, LSm8, LSm2, LSm3, and exiting at the LSm6 subunit. Experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) mutations suggest that the Lsm2-8 ring assists the reassociation of the U4 and U6 snRNPs into the U4/U6 di-snRNP. (After completion of exon deletion and intron splicing, these two snRNPs must reassociate for the spliceosome to initiate another exon/intron splicing cycle. In this role, the Lsm2-8 ring acts as an RNA chaperone instead of an RNA scaffold.) The Lsm2-8 ring also forms an snRNP with the U8 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) which localizes in the nucleolus. This ribonucleoprotein complex is necessary for processing ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA to their mature forms. The Lsm2-8 ring is reported to have a role in the processing of pre-P RNA into RNase P RNA. In contrast to the Sm ring, the Lsm2-8 ring does not permanently bind to its snRNA and snoRNA. = Sm10/Sm11 ring = A second type of Sm ring exists where LSm10 replaces SmD1 and LSm11 replaces SmD2. LSm11 is a two domain protein with the C-terminal domain being a LSm domain. This heteroheptamer ring binds with the U7 snRNA in the U7 snRNP. The U7 snRNP mediates processing of the 3' UTR stem-loop of the histone mRNA in the nucleus. Like the Sm ring, it is assembled in the cytoplasm onto the U7 snRNA by a specialized SMN complex. = Lsm1-7 ring = A second type of Lsm ring is the Lsm1-7 ring, which has the same structure as the Lsm2-8 ring except that LSm1 replaces LSm8. In contrast to the Lsm2-8 ring, the Lsm1-7 ring localizes in the cytoplasm where it assists in degrading messenger RNA in ribonucleoprotein complexes. This process controls the turnover of messenger RNA so that ribosomal translation of mRNA to protein responds quickly to changes in transcription of DNA to messenger RNA by the cell. = Gemin6 and Gemin7 = The SMN complex (described under \\"Biogenesis of snRNPs\\") is composed of the SMN protein and Gemin2-8. Two of these, Gemin 6 and Gemin7 have been discovered to have the LSm structure, and to form a heterodimer. These may have a chaperone function in the SMN complex to assist the formation of the Sm ring on the Sm-class snRNAs. PRMT5 complex is composed of PRMT5, pICln, WD45 (Mep50). pICln helps to form Sm opened ring on SMN complex. SMN complex assists in the assembly of snRNPs where the Sm ring is in the open conformation on SMN complex and this Sm ring is loaded onto the snRNA by SMN complex. = LSm12-16 and other multi- domain LSm proteins = The LSm12-16 proteins have been described very recently. These are two-domain proteins with a N-terminal LSm domain and a C-terminal methyl transferase domain. Very little is known about the function of these proteins, but presumably they are member of LSm-domain rings that interact with RNA. There is some evidence that LSm12 is possibly involved in mRNA degradation and LSm13-16 may have roles in regulation of mitosis. A large protein of unknown function, ataxin-2, associated with the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, also has a N-terminal LSm domain. = Archaeal Sm rings = Two LSm proteins are found in a second domain of life, the Archaea. These are the Sm1 and Sm2 proteins (not to be confused with the Sm1 and Sm2 sequence motifs), and are sometimes identified as Sm-like archaeal proteins SmAP1 and SmAP2 for this reason. Sm1 and Sm2 generally form homoheptamer rings, although homohexamer rings have been observed. Sm1 rings are similar to eukaryote Lsm rings in that they form in the absence of RNA while Sm2 rings are similar to eukaryote Sm rings in that they require uridine-rich RNA for their formation. They have been reported to associate with RNase P RNA, suggesting a role in transfer RNA processing, but their function in archaea in this process (and possibly processing other RNA such as ribosomal RNA) is mostly unknown. One of the two main branches of archaea, the crenarchaeotes have a third known type of archaeal LSm protein, Sm3. This is a two-domain protein with a N-terminal LSm domain that forms a homoheptamer ring. Nothing is known about the function of this LSm protein, but presumably it interacts with, and probably helps process, RNA in these organisms. = Bacterial LSm rings = Several LSm proteins have been reported in the third domain of life, the Bacteria. Hfq protein forms homohexamer rings, and was originally discovered as necessary for infection by the bacteriophage QŒ≤, although this is clearly not the native function of this protein in bacteria. It is not universally present in all bacteria, but has been found in Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Thermotogae, Aquificae and one species of Archaea. (This last instance is probably a case of horizontal gene transfer.) Hfq is pleiotropic with a variety of interactions, generally associated with translation regulation. These include blocking ribosome binding to mRNA, marking mRNA for degradation by binding to their poly-A tails, and association with bacterial small regulatory RNAs (such as DsrA RNA) that control translation by binding to certain mRNAs. A second bacterial LSm protein is YlxS (sometimes also called YhbC), which was first identified in the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. This is a two-domain protein with a N-terminal LSm domain. Its function is unknown, but amino acid sequence homologs are found in virtually every bacterial genome to date, and it may be an essential protein. The middle domain of the small conductance mechanosensitive channel MscS in Escherichia coli forms a homoheptameric ring. This LSm domain has no apparent RNA-binding function, but the homoheptameric torus is part of the central channel of this membrane protein.  Evolution and phylogeny  LSm homologs are found in all three domains of life, and may even be found in every single organism. Computational phylogenetic methods are used to infer phylogenetic relations. Sequence alignment between the various LSm homologs are the appropriate tool for this, such as multiple sequence alignment of the primary structure (amino acid sequence), and structural alignment of the tertiary structure (three-dimensional structure). It is hypothesized that a gene for a LSm protein was present in the last universal ancestor of all life. Based on the functions of known LSm proteins, this original LSm protein may have assisted ribozymes in the processing of RNA for synthesizing proteins as part of the RNA world hypothesis of early life. According to this view, this gene was passed from ancestor to descendant, with frequent mutations, gene duplications and occasional horizontal gene transfers. In principle, this process can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree with the root in the last universal ancestor (or earlier), and with the tips representing the universe of LSm genes existing today. = Homomeric LSm rings in bacteria and archaea = Based on structure, the known LSm proteins divide into a group consisting of the bacterial LSm proteins (Hfq, YlxS and MscS) and a second group of all other LSm proteins, in accordance with the most recently published phylogenetic trees. The three archaeal LSm proteins (Sm1, Sm2 and Sm3) also cluster as a group, distinct from the eukaryote LSm proteins. Both the bacterial and archaeal LSm proteins polymerize to homomeric rings, which is the ancestral condition. = Heteromeric LSm rings in eukaryotes = A series of gene duplications of a single eukaryote LSm gene resulted in most (if not all) of the known eukaryote LSm genes. Each of the seven Sm proteins has greater amino acid sequence homology to a corresponding Lsm protein than to the other Sm proteins. This suggests that an ancestral LSm gene duplicated several times, resulting in seven paralogs. These subsequently diverged from each other so that the ancestral homoheptamer LSm ring became a heteroheptamer ring. Based on the known functions of LSm proteins in eukaryotes and archaea, the ancestral function may have been processing of pre-ribosomal RNA, pre- transfer RNA, and pre-RNase P. Then, according to this hypothesis, the seven ancestral eukaryote LSm genes duplicated again to seven pairs of Sm/LSm paralogs; LSm1/SmB, LSm2/SmD1, LSm3/SmD2, LSm4/SmD3, LSm5/SmE, LSm6/SmF and LSm7/SmG. These two group of seven LSm genes (and the corresponding two kinds of LSm rings) evolved to an Sm ring (requiring RNA) and a Lsm ring (which forms without RNA). The LSm1/LSm8 paralog pair also seems to have originated prior to the last common eukaryote ancestor, for a total of at least 15 LSm protein genes. The SmD1/LSm10 paralog pair and the SmD2/LSm11 paralog pair exist only in animals, fungi, and the amoebozoa (sometimes identified as the unikont clade) and appears to be absent in the bikont clade (chromalveolates, excavates, plants and rhizaria). Therefore, these two gene duplications predated this fundamental split in the eukaryote lineage. The SmB/SmN paralog pair is seen only in the placental mammals, which dates this LSm gene duplication.  Biogenesis of snRNPs  Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) assemble in a tightly orchestrated and regulated process that involves both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.

It ran from 1994 to 1996 in a series of 52 fortnightly serialisations. The aim of the magazine was to introduce children into classical music and to popularise this form of music among the younger generations. The stories followed the fictional adventures of two siblings, Sarah and Jamie who find a magical music box through which they are able to enter other worlds, most commonly as spectators. The stories were generally related to other children's tales or fables, including issue 38 (King Arthur & The knights of the round table), issue 2 (Pere Gynt, issue 11 (Sinbad the Sailor), and issue 27 (The Imperial Robes). The dramatisations were produced by IRDP, Independent Radio Drama Productions on request of Marshall Cavendish Partworks Ltd Features The magazine cost ¬£3.99 (with a tape) or ¬£4.99 (with a CD) per issue. * A different fortnightly story involving the siblings Sarah and Jamie * A CD or tape with each issue * The story in spoken word with an accompaniment of classical music * The classical music on its own * History behind the stories and the music * Facts about the relevant composer and instruments *The formula for the magazine was simple. It followed the adventures of Jamie and Sarah, siblings who seemed to be magnets for danger. The stories had no sense of realism and were pure fantasy. The children seemed to be running around having adventures with no money, food or supervision. It is a pure fantasy which excited the youths imagination at the time. The music was used to construct the narrative through the adventurers and to the conclusions. That is why the magazine came with a tape or CD so you could listen to the story and the music. The magazine also had a strong educational element after each story. The narrator introduced the learner to each part of the music that had been played, and explained which instruments were used. Issues  Awards  The magazine won a Gold Medal and a Grand Award Trophy for Entertainment Programming at the International Radio Festival 1994 held in New York. These were for the drama in issue four, The Wizard's Spell.

It attempted to be a refreshing alternative to other UK film magazines such as Sight & Sound and was seen as the movie version of Select magazine as Empire was originally to Q. History and profile Started in 1996, Neon included latest film news, previews, actor profiles, interviews and contemporary movie profiles all written with a characteristic sense of humor. Each issue featured A Monthly Selection of Ten Favourite Things with a celebrity listing a particular category for their ten favorite films, for example, James Ellroy in the July 1998 issue picked his ten favorite crime movies. What's your favourite Chevy Chase movie? featured the magazine asking various celebrities from the Beastie Boys to Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee their favorite Chase film. 100 Scenes From... was an irreverent Top 100 list that parodied the notion of such lists. Blow Up was a 12-page insert included in the middle of every issue that featured stills, promotional pictures of posters of movies and movie stars. Another regular staple was called, Flashback, a detailed, oral history of a classic movie with comments culled from cuttings and original interviews with cast and crew members. This format was later copied by another UK film periodical, Hotdog Magazine. Finally, Graham Linehan's Filmgoer's Companion took a satirical look at the entertainment industry. Neon also championed lesser known films like Mike Leigh's Naked and ran in-depth profiles of films such as Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, the magazine did not make a profit and after the original editor left, it took a more commercial direction. The circulation numbers diminished and Neon was eventually cancelled in February 1999.

Early career Bishop was born in Tottenham and went to Tottenham Grammar School. At the age of 17 he became an assistant copywriter in the advertising department of The Times, but soon left for war service in the Royal Flying Corps in France. On demobilisation in 1919, he rejoined The Times while studying law in his spare time at King's College London. He was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn in 1924.\\"Sir Patrick Bishop\\" (obituary), The Times, 6 October 1972, p. 16. Advertising From 1927, Bishop was chairman of the Advertising Association's committee on patent medicine advertising standards. He also headed the association's investigation department until 1934. He kept up his work for The Times while working as a Barrister, using the combination of the two to write a definitive book on \\"Advertising and the Law\\" which was published in 1928. In the same year he was appointed Advertising Manager of The Times, a demanding post as the newspaper felt its reputation depended on the claims made in the adverts being scrupulously checked. Wartime activities As Assistant Manager of The Times from 1937, he found himself responsible for making arrangements to continue the publication of the paper during the Second World War. During the Blitz he was often on the roof, putting out incendiary devices dropped by the Luftwaffe. He joined the Home Guard and became second in command of its 'press battalion', for which he was awarded the MBE in December 1944. He wrote further books about the ethics of advertising in the late 1940s. Business career Soon after the end of the war, Bishop left The Times to join Broadcast Relay, and he became a Director of Rediffusion. From 1947 he was also general manager of the Newsprint Supply Company. This was a company jointly set up by the newspaper industry to manage the supply of paper, then still in short supply due to rationing; the company was in an uneasy position between the government, who controlled rationing, and the newspapers, who were seeking to sell more copies and so increase their print run. He was at the company for ten years. Politics Having been active in local politics, and assisting in the rebuilding of the Conservative Party after its 1945 election defeat, Bishop was asked to stand for Parliament. At the 1950 general election Bishop was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Harrow Central.\\"The Times House of Commons 1950\\", p. 110. Parliament He proved a moderate MP (he supported a coalition between the Conservative Party and the Liberals), who often sought to balance competing interests. When a Labour MP put forward a Bill to establish a General Council of the Press, Bishop put the case for a voluntary system of regulation, which he was able to inform the House was close to agreement.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 29 November 1952, p. 9. However he was strongly offended by the way the \\"Red Cross Society of China\\" (a body unrelated to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement) inserted Communist propaganda in letters sent home by British forces taken prisoner in the Korean War.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 2 December 1952, p. 3. Later career When newsprint rationing ended, Bishop became Chairman of Morphy Richards, the consumer electrical company in 1957.\\"Business Changes\\", The Times, 6 February 1957, p. 14. He supported the Public Bodies (Admission of the Press to Meetings) Bill promoted by Margaret Thatcher in 1960, a Bill prompted by the decision of some Labour-controlled councils to refuse admission to the press where the newspapers involved were in the middle of an industrial dispute.\\"Press Bill Amendment On Disputes Withdrawn\\", The Times, 7 April 1960, p. 8. Morphy Richards were taken over by EMI in 1960, a move opposed by Bishop and which led to his resignation that December.\\"Changes In Morphy-Richards Board\\", The Times, 9 December 1960, p. 24. Bishop was advised in 1962 to end his Parliamentary career on medical grounds, and therefore announced that he would stand down.\\"To Oppose Mr. Grimond\\", The Times, 15 November 1962, p. 6. He was awarded a knighthood in the New Years' Honours list of 1964. He finally left the Rediffusion Board in 1970. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead, Suffolk.

She represented her nation at the 2000 Summer Olympics, the first time the event was recognised by the competition. After a twenty-year career, Moore retired from gymnastics in January 2010 to focus on coaching. Biography Northampton-born Moore started out, at the age of five, as a gymnast, and five years later she took up trampolining after discovering beach trampolines in Great Yarmouth, where her parents used to take her on holiday. She was spotted by Tracy Whittaker-Smith, the coach of Northamptonshire Trampoline Gymnastics Academy. Moore joined the Academy, and Whittaker-Smith went on to be her coach for her entire career. It was not long until Moore entered her first competition, which she won. Moore came to prominence in 1994, aged 14, by winning the synchronised competition at the World Age Games and finishing second at the European Youth Championships. Two years later, she won the individual and team events. In 1999, she became British champion and finished ninth at the World Championships in South Africa. It won her country the first place at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In Australia, she finished twelfth. Injuries prevented her from appearing at the 2004 Games in Athens. In July 2005 Moore won her sixth national title, but her first since coming out of retirement. Also in 2005, reacting to the news that London had won the bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics, Moore said: \\"It's going to be really brilliant. The Olympics is the most amazing experience an athlete can have. To be part of it, especially in your home country, has got to be just incredible.\\" On 25 November 2005, Moore and Claire Wright won the British Championship title in synchronised trampolining. In 2006, she missed out on obtaining the British senior title by just a tenth of a point to compatriot Claire Wright. She did, however, break her own record for difficulty, with a 13.1 total. Also in 2006, Moore attended the eighth FIG Trampoline and Tumbling World Cup final, which was held in Birmingham. After winning Britain's place at the Beijing Olympics, Moore finished below Claire Wright in the European Championships and travelled to China as the reserve.\\"Moore heads to Beijing as reserve\\".

Hairston has played in one Super Bowl and coached in another during his 30 seasons in the National Football League. Among his 15 years in the league since the end of his playing career, the daunting Hairston has spent 11 seasons as a defensive line coach. He joined the Green Bay Packers from Kansas City, where he spent seven years (1995‚Äì1996 and 2001‚Äì2005), after sandwiching a four-year term as St. Louis Rams defensive line coach (1997‚Äì2000) between his two stints with the Chiefs. Professional career Originally a seventh-round selection (191st overall) by Vermeil's Eagles in 1976, Hairston preceded Reggie White on the Eagles' line (1976‚Äì1983), then spent six years in Cleveland (1984‚Äì1989) and one final campaign with the Cardinals (1990). In 224 games (184 starts), he posted 94 sacks among 1,141 tackles. He started for the Eagles at defensive end in Super Bowl XV against the Oakland Raiders, one of his 15 postseason contests played. Coaching career Originally a pro scout with the Chiefs in 1994, Hairston also spent three seasons (1991‚Äì1993) as a college scout with the Phoenix Cardinals, where he had finished his playing career. Marty Schottenheimer gave Hairston his first full-time coaching position at any level, Chiefs defensive line coach (1995‚Äì1996), a role in which he worked with then-quarterbacks coach McCarthy. Tutoring one of the most-feared defensive fronts, Hairston and his players helped the 13-3 Chiefs finish third in the NFL with 47 sacks. Again, his unit produced a pair of Pro Bowl performers, Neil Smith and Dan Saleaumua. On the field as either a player or coach during all 240 games of Dick Vermeil's career, Hairston first joined the legendary coach for a memorable run with the Rams. In Hairston's first year with the Rams, 1997, he assisted Leslie O'Neal to a ten-sack performance. He also coached a pair of players, Kevin Carter and Grant Wistrom, to double digits in sacks in 2000. One year earlier, when the Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV, his unit provided most of St. Louis' 57 sacks, which tied for the league lead. Carter's NFL-leading 17 sacks that year powered him to the Pro Bowl, where he joined his neighbor on the Rams line, D'Marco Farr. Under Hairston, Chiefs defensive end Jared Allen accumulated 20 sacks from 2004‚Äì2005, tied for tenth in the NFL during that period but first among players drafted in 2004, including 23 defensive linemen taken before him. Led by Allen's nine sacks as a rookie, the Chiefs finished 2004 with 41 sacks, seventh in the league. He joined the Packers as a defensive ends coach in 2006, but was let go‚Äîalong with the majority of the defensive coaching staff‚Äîafter a disappointing 2008 season.Green Bay Packers Fire Six Coaches January 5, 2009 After spending time coaching in the United Football League, Hairston was hired as the defensive line coach for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League.

Because of their location and lack of valves, they are believed to provide a route for the spread of cancer metastases. These metastases commonly arise from cancer of the pelvic organs such as the rectum and prostate and may spread to the vertebral column or brain. The plexus is named after anatomist Oscar Vivian Batson, who first described it in 1940. Batson's plexus is part of the Cerebrospinal venous system. Batson's venous plexus may also allow the spread of infection in a similar manner. Urinary tract infections like pyelonephritis have been shown to spread to cause osteomyelitis of the vertebrae via this route. The osteomyelitis in such a case will resolve concurrently with the same antibiotic that treats the urinary tract infection because both infections are from the same organism.

Established in 1924, it was the first attempt at organizing the Pentecostal movement in New Zealand. After a series of splits, however, the church disbanded in 1952. The roots of Pentecostalism in New Zealand are in late 19th-century revivalism, which emphasized personal experience and divine healing. However, Classical Pentecostalism emerged only in the 1920s, largely as the result of British evangelist Smith Wigglesworth's healing campaigns in the country, first in 1922 and later in 1923-1924. The Pentecostal Church of New Zealand was formed in 1924 with the help of American evangelist A. C. Valdez to preserve and organize the results of the Wigglesworth campaigns.\\"New Zealand\\". The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements. Rev. ed. Edited by Stanley M. Burgess and Eduard M. van der Mass. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 2003. Kindle edition. By 1926, however, conflict within the church, particularly over governance, began a process of fragmentation. Some congregations left the PCNZ and affiliated with the Assemblies of God. In 1932, the arrival of the British-based Apostolic Church to New Zealand led to a loss of disaffected PCNZ members. The Pentecostal Church also had to compete with other Pentecostal groups, such as A. H. Dallimore's Revival Fire churches and the New Zealand counterpart to the Australian-based Christian Revival Crusade. The Pentecostal Church split again in 1946 after three American pastors introduced baptism in the name of \\"Lord Jesus Christ\\" (rather than of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit). This was understood in a trinitarian sense and was not the same as the Unitarian baptism in Jesus' name. These American pastors led a breakaway group that became associated with the Latter Rain Movement and today is known as the New Life Churches. What remained of the Pentecostal Church in New Zealand disbanded in 1952 and affiliated with the Elim Pentecostal Church based in the United Kingdom. The Elim Church of New Zealand claims over 40 congregations.\\"Our History\\". Elim Church of New Zealand. Accessed April 2, 2012. References Further reading * Dasler, Y. Then They Came to Elim. N.Z.

Black's Law Dictionary defines \\"quasi\\" as being \\"almost\\" or \\"resembling\\" - but not actually the same as the suffix item. Black's Law Dictionary (2nd Pocket ed. 2001 pg. 576). Property Law gives the owner of real property or personal property a \\"bundle of rights\\" for beneficial use, such as the right to sell the property or right to lifetime use of the property. Examples A notable and early occurrence of quasi-property being found by a court under American law was the case of International News Service v. Associated Press. The Associated Press Sued International News Service for taking the substance of AP news stories, rewriting the articles, and publishing the stories in its own member newspapers. This activity did not violate copyright law because the original AP articles were not copyrighted, and also because the subsequent INS articles copied only the facts‚Äî using different language to report the story. Nonetheless, the Court recognized an interest in the news distributor of information they had researched and gathered. A traditional property right would have granted the AP a right to exclude others from the content of their news stories good for all time and against everyone. The court described this new right as quasi-property because it only granted them the power to exclude their competitors for a limited amount of time from the substance of their articles. The general public had free rein to distribute the subject matter of the news without restriction. Creation of the new right was justified as protecting the AP from the \\"unfair competition\\" of a party who was reproducing the information and attempting to profit by distributing it faster than the creator. Another prominent example of quasi-property under US law is the continuing ownership of a person's right to publicity even after death.

The earliest record of cricket in Littlehampton was of a game on 2 July 1802 on the Littlehampton Green when a match between the Gentlemen of Sussex and the Storrington Club was played. On 3 June 1813 a team from Littlehampton played a team from Lancing and in 1816 the residents played a visitors‚Äô side. By the end of the 1860s an occasional cricket ground was on the Common immediately south of the Roman Catholic Church, where there was ‚Äòa level plateau of perfectly natural formation‚Äô, known locally as ‚ÄúThe Cow Ground‚Äù.

The former Clapham and Patching Cricket Club was the runner-up in Division 2 of the Sussex Championship League in 1993 and was also the runner-up in the Sussex Championship League Cup in the same year. In addition, the Club plays in the Worthing and District Knock Out Cup ‚Äì an evening competition and has been the winner of this Cup on several occasions. The Club has also entered six-a-side teams in the Worthing and Bognor Regis indoor cricket competitions. The Club is the most successful local side by far in these indoor contests and has numerous trophy wins over the past thirty years. During the 2005 season the club secured the services of Chris Cooke as their overseas player who later signed a contract with Glamorgan CCC. Formation of the Club The first record of the formation of a Littlehampton Cricket Club came from the West Sussex Gazette of 29 September 1859 when it was reported ‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is the first season of the Littlehamptonites forming a cricket club, they have played eight matches.‚Äù However, there were few reports of subsequent matches, which indicated that the Club had ceased to exist by 1866. Reformation of the Club On 15 December 1870 the same paper reported that cricket enthusiasts had got together to form a cricket club for 1871 under the presidency of the Reverend W. B. Philpott. His Grace the Duke of Norfolk favourably received an application for the cricket ground on the Common to be permanently established. In 1873 notice was received from the Duke of Norfolk‚Äôs Arundel Estate Office that the cricket pitch on the Common would no longer be available. Arrangements were made in 1875, with the Duke, to rent a field of six acres (2.4 hectares) at the rear of Selborne Road.

As it is proposed the present cricket ground > (Selborne Road) will before very long be required for building purposes, the > acquisition of the new ground will be greatly appreciated.‚Äù The 200 year Sportsfield lease stated ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Duke has decided to substitute another Field for the said Cricket Field and to vest the same in Trustees for the purpose of Cricket, Football and other sports.‚Äù At a meeting in February 1898 it was proposed that the Littlehampton Cricket Club, the Littlehampton Association Football Club, the Littlehampton Swifts Football Club and the Littlehampton Athletic and Cycling Sports Club use the ground. The ground was prepared for sports with fencing and a pavilion provided in time for the 1900 cricket season. The official opening of the ground was performed by Lady Mary Howard, sister of the Duke of Norfolk, and was commemorated with a two-day cricket match between the Gentlemen of Sussex and the Players of Sussex. The game was drawn. In 1939 the Littlehampton Gazette reported that the Duke of Norfolk ‚Äúhas decided that the general interest and progress of the town can best be served by the transfer of ownership to those who can give undivided attention to it and are able to carry out expansion on the best lines‚Äù. The Sportsfield formed part of the estate of the Duke. In 1940 the sale was confirmed with a private trust company. Early, in 1962, after previously changing hands a number of times, the Sportsfield was conveyed to Ortem Estates Limited as part of a transaction involving the acquisition of the Beaumont Estate for residential development. On 29 March 1962 the freehold was sold on to Trustees appointed by the Littlehampton Cricket Club for the sum of ¬£10. The West Sussex Gazette reported ‚Äì ‚ÄúLittlehampton Cricket Club has bought the freehold of the Sportsfield and so ensured that the ground will remain the town‚Äôs sports‚Äô centre for all times.‚Äù The successor Trustees, appointed in accordance with the terms of the original lease in 1894, were not affected by the purchase. They would continue to be responsible for the administration and maintenance of the ground until the lease terminated in the year 2087 unless the Sportsfield Trustees decided that they could not run the ground. In that case the control of the Sportsfield would be passed to the Cricket Club. Cricket in Clapham and Patching The first reference relating to cricket being played by Patching was reported in the Sussex Weekly Advertiser on 22 July 1771 when Hurst played Patching and Portslade at Hurstpierpoint. Clapham and Patching were the runners-up in the Nind Challenge Trophy in 1897. The trophy had been presented by Mr. P.W.Nind for the East Preston Cricket League. Clapham and Patching Cricket Club remained a difficult side to beat into the early 1900s. In 1914 the Club played in the six-a-side Blauw Tournament at East Preston when the performances of Arthur William Fitzroy Somerset and Arthur Plantaganet Francis Cecil Somerset brought about a win for Clapham and Patching. The organisers took exception to this and the Competition was not repeated again for over half a Century. In the 1930s the Club, which was then known as Patching and Clapham Cricket Club, was linked with the former Durrington Cricket Club and played on a pitch behind the Coach and Horses and used a Southdown Coach as a pavilion. During the course of the Second World War the pitch at Frog‚Äôs Hole, Clapham deteriorated into an overgrown field and it took two weeks to relocate the cricket square. The Club constructed a hut to use as a pavilion and this existed until 1978 when the Village Hall was constructed. The freehold of the Ground was owned by the Duke of Norfolk‚Äôs Estate and when offered to the Club for ¬£11,000 in 1974 the Chairman rejected the offer without consulting the Club Committee. The Village Hall Management Committee purchased the ground with a covenant that safeguarded the future of cricket at Frog‚Äôs Hole in perpetuity. The village pitch name, Frog's Hole, relates to the large number of frogs that inhabited the wet surroundings. Some romantics have erroneously suggested that the name derives from a nearby prisoner of war camp that existed for the French soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars. Club Merging In 1999, the Clapham and Patching Cricket Club merged with the Littlehampton Club which not only secured the future of the village Club but also enabled the new Club to field a 4th XI on Saturdays and consistently to field two Sunday XIs.

It works without the use of a computer. It is also known as a portable photo printer or a snapshot printer. Overview Compact photo printers came on the market shortly after the popularity of home photo printing took off in the early 2000s. They were designed as an alternative to developing photos or printing them on a standard inkjet photo printer. The majority of compact photo printers can only print 4\\" x 6\\" pictures. Given this limitation, they are not meant to replace standard inkjets. Many manufacturers advertise the cost per page of photos printed on their machines; this theoretically convinces people that they can print their own pictures just as cheaply as retail stores or through online printing services. Most compact photo printers share a similar design. They are small units, usually with large LCDs in order to allow people to browse and edit their photos, as can be done on a computer. The editing options are usually somewhat advanced, allowing the user to crop photos, remove red eye, adjust color settings as well as other functions. Compact photo printers typically feature a large number of connection options, including USB and most memory card formats. Compact photo printers are currently manufactured by most of the leading printer manufacturers such as Epson, Canon, HP, Lexmark and Kodak. While they have increased in popularity in recent years, they still make up a relatively small share of the inkjet printer market. The other compact photo printer is Pocket Photo from LG which can print 600 dpi on 2\\"√ó3\\" paper and support Android, iOS and Windows 8. The Pocket Photo uses Zink thermal paper which has chemistries imbedded on each inkless photo paper and the image will appear with the heat.

Its coverage area also includes the municipalities of Greenland, New Castle, Newington and Rye, New Hampshire; and Eliot, Kittery, Kittery Point and South Berwick, Maine. Unlike most New England daily newspapers, The Herald circulation grew in the 2000s. Its editors in 2001 credited the newspaper's resurgence with the introduction of the \\"Wow! factor\\"  front-page stories on controversial or sensational topics that appeal to younger readers.Nicholson, Joe. \\"Portsmouth Herald Does Not Take the Traditional Approach to Reporting,\\" Brandweek, April 30, 2001.  Founding  The Portsmouth Herald considers its foundation date to be September 23, 1884, the day that its predecessor The Penny Post first appeared in Portsmouth. The Penny Post (named for its newsstand price) within two years was claiming to have the largest circulation base in New England. The Post adopted the name Portsmouth Herald in mid-1897, and cost 2 cents per issue. Traced back through the history of its sister papers, however, the Herald has an even longer pedigree. In 1891, F.W. Hartford took over The Penny Post and initiated a newspaper war with two of the city's longest established papers, the Morning Chronicle (daily since 1852) and the weekly New Hampshire Gazette (the state's oldest newspaper, established October 7, 1756). He eventually bought out his rivals, and announced on April 5, 1898, that he had taken control of the Chronicle and Gazette. Hartford continued to publish the Morning Chronicle as the morning counterpart to the evening Herald until his death in 1938; he and his son J.D. Hartford kept The New Hampshire Gazette in print as the weekend edition of the Herald, partially out of pride in being associated with \\"the nation's oldest newspaper\\". Even after the Herald Sunday paper was renamed in the 1960s, the slogan \\"Continuing the tradition of the N.H. Gazette\\" continued to appear on the front page. Eventually the Herald allowed its claim to the Gazette history fall into disuse, and in 1989, a descendant of the Gazette's founder began publishing an alternative weekly newspaper under the name The New Hampshire Gazette.  Ownership  The Herald and its sister weekly newspapers in New Hampshire and Maine form the Seacoast Media Group, a subsidiary of Local Media Group. It was acquired for the Ottaway chain by Dow Jones & Company, which formerly owned the chain, December 1, 1997,Kittredge, Clare. \\"A News War Takes Shape in Portsmouth\\".

Paper\\", October 1, 1997. Accessed January 11, 2007. News Corporation acquired The Herald when it bought former owner Dow Jones & Company for US$5 billion in late 2007. Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp., reportedly told investors before the deal that he would be \\"selling the local newspapers fairly quickly\\" after the Dow Jones purchase.\\"Ottaway Papers Might Be Sold, Including 16 in N.E.\\". NEPA Bulletin (Boston, Mass.), December 2007 , page 3. On September 4, 2013, News Corp announced that it would sell the Dow Jones Local Media Group to Newcastle Investment Corp.‚Äîan affiliate of Fortress Investment Group, for $87 million. The newspapers will be operated by GateHouse Media, a newspaper group owned by Fortress. News Corp. CEO and former Wall Street Journal editor Robert James Thomson indicated that the newspapers were \\"not strategically consistent with the emerging portfolio\\" of the company. GateHouse in turn filed prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 27, 2013, to restructure its debt obligations in order to accommodate the acquisition.  Competition  During the tail end of Thomson's ownership of The Herald, it was seen as corporate and out-of-touch with the local community. Several weekly newspapers sprang up to challenge it in Portsmouth and surrounding towns.Robinson, J. Dennis. \\"July 10.\\" July 10, 1998. Accessed January 11, 2007. Years before buying The Herald, Ottaway started a weekly newspaper, the Portsmouth Press, in 1987. For six years, that paper competed with the daily. Its publisher, John Tabor, eventually became publisher of The Herald. The Herald's strongest daily competitors are Foster's Daily Democrat in nearby Dover, New Hampshire, and the statewide New Hampshire Union Leader. In the late 1990s, the Geo. J. Foster Company launched Foster's Sunday Citizen, to compete with Herald Sunday and the state's largest Sunday paper, the New Hampshire Sunday News. Around the same time, The Herald's Ottaway managers announced they would begin distributing Herald Sunday outside of the daily newspaper's coverage area, into the Exeter and Hampton areas, where Seacoast Media Group publishes weeklies. The paper also faces hometown competition from an alternative newsweekly, The New Hampshire Gazette, named after the state's oldest newspaper, which had been absorbed into the Herald in the 1890s. On October 31, 2010, Seacoast Media Group announced plans to charge online users nearly $69 per year to access the previously free content. The fee took effect November 16, 2010.

It is the owner of the Ibanez guitar and Tama drum brand names.  History  The Hoshino company was founded in 1908 by Matsujiro Hoshino originally as the Hoshino Shoten bookstore which mostly sold books and sheet music and then gradually over the years also began to import musical instruments into Japan. Matsujiro was succeeded by Yoshitaro Hoshino. From 1929 Hoshino imported Spanish guitars of Salvador Ib√°√±ez e Hijos, resident in Valencia, which company was bought in 1933 by Telesforo Julve, also from Valencia. In 1935, Hoshino began manufacturing their own stringed instruments, using the name Ibanez Salvador, later shortened as \\"Ibanez\\". The company had little presence in the Western world until the mid-1960s. In 1957 Hoshino Gakki manufactured what would be considered the first of the modern era Ibanez guitars. In 1962, Junpei Hoshino, Yoshitaro's son, opened the Tama Seisakusho factory to manufacture electric guitars and amplifiers. The Tama Seisakusho factory produced a line of guitars that included clones of several popular guitars, including the Martin Dreadnought. At the time they were also manufacturing Star Drums, available in either the Imperial or Royal models. Hoshino Gakki stopped making guitars at the Tama Seisakusho factory in 1966 (but continued making drums) and from then on contracted outside guitar factories which in the mid 1960s mainly consisted of Guyatone. Beginning in the 70's guitars were almost exclusively manufactured by FujiGen which remains one of the main sources for Japanese Ibanez guitars.http://www.GuyatoneUS.com Timeline * 1908: The Hoshino Shoten bookstore company is founded by Matsujiro Hoshino.

It is based on the River Lagan in the Stranmillis area of the city, about 10 minutes' walk from the university. History =1931‚Äì1951= The Queen's University of Belfast Boat Club was founded in 1931, due to the work of four founding members: J.W. Rigby, D.B. McNeill, F. Maunsell and J.F. Doggart. Towards the end of January 1932 the newly formed club signed an agreement with Belfast Commercial Boat Club for accommodation that was its home until 1951. Membership rose from a dozen or so in 1932 to a maximum of 65 by 1937. The club competed regularly in regattas in Ireland and Scotland. Rowing was maintained at a low level throughout the war years; however, after the war the club really started making an impact, and under the vigorous captaincy of F.J. Boyle (1944/45), it won the Wylie Cup (Irish University Championships) for the first time. Success continued under H.F. Jackson in 1945/46 when the club retained the Wylie Cup, and next year went to Henley Royal Regatta for the first time. In 1947 a Queen's four won the Metropolitan Challenge Cup (the 'Blue Riband' of Irish Four rowing) and many other trophies. In 1951 the university provided a \\"temporary wooden structure\\" on the site of the present clubhouse, which was officially opened during the captaincy of John Gorman, when the club went to the Putney Head of the River and came 13th.Alf McCreary & Brian Walker. (1994) Degrees of Excellence, The Story of Queen's, Belfast 1845-1995. Belfast:Institute of Irish Studies, Queen's University Belfast. (March 1, 1994) =1952‚Äì1967= Queen's racing at Henley Royal Regatta in 2003 From their newly established clubhouse, Queen's came to be a dominant force in Irish rowing and a major club in the university. Under John Alexander's captaincy, Queen's won the Wylie Cup and the Irish Senior Championship (the 'Big Pot') in 1952. The club won the 'Big Pot' five more times, in 1953, 1956, 1957, 1959 and 1962. The victory in 1957 was remarkable because it was won by a 'second' Queen's crew, as the Championships were held during Henley Royal Regatta. In 1958 the Queen's Senior Crew represented Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Games Regatta instead of attending the National Championships. That crew reached the third round of the Thames Cup at Henley, as did the crew in 1959. Other divisions of the club did well, as the splendid record of the Wylie Cup shows: the only years Queen's failed to win the cup were 1958, 1959, 1961 and 1966. Queen's Junior (now Intermediate) crews won the National Championships in 1958, 1960, and 1962 and the Maiden (Novice) crews in 1953, 1955, 1961, 1963, 1967 and 1969. Club membership was usually about 100 at the beginning of each year, and frequently 4 or 5 'eights' rowed right through the season from October to July. The social side of life was not neglected, and the Boat Club Dinner and Formal Dance were among the highlights of the Queen's year. In 1967 Queen's held a regatta on the Lagan; this became an annual event and eventually transferred to its present venue at Castlewellan Lake. =1968‚Äì1983= Despite the success which Queen's had enjoyed for the previous fifteen years, there were developments in Irish rowing which left these years rather bereft of trophies for the club. Yet there were still great efforts made at Queen's, such as in 1976 when the Senior crew reached the final of the Ladies' Challenge Plate at Henley. Also in 1976, the \\"temporary wooden structure\\" was at last replaced with a proper clubhouse. J.W.F. Boyd was captain when the club's new home was opened, and three 'eights' made up of past captains and members rowed a short race to celebrate the occasion. After graduating, many members rowed for Lady Victoria Boat Club or the newly founded Belfast Rowing Club. John Armstrong, Captain 1982-83, won both the Open and Lightweight Championships in 1983. Recent years The 2005 Irish Championship winning Queen's crew receiving the IARU Trophy. Holding the cup is QUB Vice Chancellor Peter Gregson. Queen's have achieved much success in recent years. In 1996 they won both the Wylie Cup and the Intermediate 8 Championship. In 2001 a Queen's coxless pair of James Cleland and Jonny Hill won the Irish championships and followed it up the next season by representing Ireland in the Home internationals and Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Rowing Championships. In 2003 Queen's raced in the Head of the Charles in Boston for the first time, entering the championship and college 8's races. In 2005 Queen's, under the captaincy of Chris Wylie, won the Intermediate 8's championship of Ireland ahead of Neptune R.C, and also won the University 8's event at Amsterdam International Regatta beating Orca R.C into second place. In the 2008/2009 season QUBBC appointed its first professional coach who delivered immediate success with Queen's winning the Novice and Intermediate Championships of Ireland as well as narrowly missing out on the Senior Championship. They also won the Wylie Cup for the first time in 13 years and produced a strong showing at Henley Royal Regatta, equalling the course record to the barrier as they competed in the Temple Challenge Cup.Henley Royal Regatta 2013 2010 saw Queen's win the Senior VIII and Senior 4X in the BUCS Regatta and again fall to a narrow defeat in the Senior Championship of Ireland.

Back to basics. Accessed and added 2015-02-27 History The Z1300 had six cylinders, water cooling, and shaft drive. The undersquare stroke of 71 mm and bore of 62 mm kept the engine width acceptable, but the high piston speed limited the maximum rpm figure. During its ten-year production run, fuelling was switched from carburetors to electronic fuel injection and suspension was upgraded to air systems front and rear. Fuel injection system was adopted primarily to improve fuel consumption, but as a bonus were increased power and torque. Although its straight-six engine was smooth, the motorcycle was heavy, expensive and thirsty, and the Z1300 sold poorly, particularly in Europe. One amateur reviewer on a modern website criticised the handling, stating it \\"wallowed, weaved and bucked\\", and the engine covered only 30 miles per UK gallon. When released, its output in excess of prompted France to introduce a limit on new motorcycles. However, no other EU country followed suit, and France is set to abolish the 100 bhp limit in 2016. The Kawasaki Z1300 was manufactured in several versions, namely: Z1300, KZ1300, ZG1300 and ZN1300. It is the biggest model of the still-ongoing Z series that was started in 1972 with the Z1 (900). In the U.S., the model was equipped with a windshield, suitcase, and a redesigned frame. This new model was called \\"Voyager\\". In Europe, the traditional model was still available. The last 200 models (built in America as all Z1300 models were), built in 1989, have been called \\"Legendary Six\\", and were equipped with a special logo on the fuel tank to show that to the public. After a ten-year production run, Kawasaki's only liquid-cooled six-cylinder engine motorcycle was discontinued in 1989 after 20,000 KZ1300/Z1300 models and 4,500 Voyager models had been produced. Cycle World tested the 1979 KZ1300's time at 11.93 seconds at and 0 to 60 mph time at 4.01 seconds. Sbarro Super Twelve In 1982, Swiss specialty car manufacturer Sbarro constructed a mid-engined sports car with hatchback bodywork called the Sbarro Super Twelve. The Super Twelve had an inline twelve-cylinder engine (a nominal straight-12) which consisted of two \\"joined\\" Z1300 engines. The two engines were not a unit, as such, they were connected only by belt. Each engine kept its own gearbox and drove its own rear wheel. The car weighed and produced . Performance was described as \\"ferocious\\". Only one was ever built. Millyard Z2300 V-12 In 2008, noted British engineer and motorcycle customizer Allen Millyard built a one-off 2300 cc version of the Z1300 by joining two Z1300 engines together in a V-12 configuration.

By 1975, the number of poets involved with the venture outgrew that space, so Algar√≠n rented an Irish pub, the Sunshine Caf√© on East 6th Street, and they named it \\"The Nuyorican Poets Cafe\\". Some of the featured poets at this time included founders Miguel Algar√≠n, Miguel Pi√±ero,Pedro Pietri, Victor Hern√°ndez Cruz, Tato Laviera, Piri Thomas, Jes√∫s Papoleto Mel√©ndez, and Jos√© Angel Figueroa were some of the poets featured during the mid to late 1970s. By 1980, the overflow of audiences led them to purchase their current building at 236 East 3rd Street so as to expand their activities and programs. Among the few early Nuyorican women poets was Sandra Mar√≠a Esteves. A second wave of major Nuyorican Poets, featured at the cafe, emerged including Nancy Mercado, Giannina Braschi, and Mart√≠n Espada. The Nuyorican Poets Cafe counts poetry activists such as Bob Holman, Saul Williams, Sarah Jones, and Beau Sia as former slammasters and was the home to the now mobile New York freestyle battle program Braggin' Rites. The exterior walls are painted by a local artist \\"Chico\\" who has done neighborhood murals for decades. Above the entry doorway hangs Diana Gitesha Hernandez's acrylic painting. In explaining the philosophy of the venture, co-founder Algar√≠n said: \\"We must listen to one another. We must respect one another's habits and we must share the truth and the integrity that the voice of the poet so generously provides. In the 1990s a new group of Nuyorican poets and performing artists emerged to read at the cafe. in 2008, Daniel Gallant was appointed executive director. In 2015, Carmen was the first full-length opera shown at the cafe, produced by IconoClassic Opera. In popular culture In 1994, Nuyorican Poets Cafe was the subject of a 14-minute documentary entitled Nuyorican Poets Cafe. Directed, produced and edited by Ray Santisteban, the documentary features founder Miguel Algarin along with Willie Perdomo, Ed Morales, Pedro Pietri, and Carmen Bardeguez Brown.

Nozzles are used for three purposes: to distribute a liquid over an area, to increase liquid surface area, and create impact force on a solid surface.Lipp, Charles W., Practical Spray Technology: Fundamentals and Practice, 2012, A wide variety of spray nozzle applications use a number of spray characteristics to describe the spray.Nasr, Yule and Bending, \\"Industrial Sprays and Atomization\\", Springer, 2002, Spray nozzles can be categorized based on the energy input used to cause atomization, the breakup of the fluid into drops.Lipp, C.W., Sprays Article, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 5th Ed 2005W.R. Marshall Jr. Atomization and Spray Drying, Am. Inst of Chem Engr. Monograph Series, 1954 Spray nozzles can have one or more outlets; a multiple outlet nozzle is known as a compound nozzle. Spray nozzles range from heavy duty industrial uses to light duty spray cans or spray bottles. Single-fluid nozzle Single-fluid or hydraulic spray nozzles utilize the kinetic energy of the liquid to break it up into droplets. This most widely used type of spray nozzle is more energy efficient at producing surface area than most other types. As the fluid pressure increases, the flow through the nozzle increases, and the drop size decreases. Many configurations of single fluid nozzles are used depending on the spray characteristics desired. =Plain-orifice nozzle= The simplest single fluid nozzle is a plain orifice nozzle as shown in the diagram. This nozzle often produces little if any atomization, but directs the stream of liquid. If the pressure drop is high, at least , the material is often finely atomized, as in a diesel injector. At lower pressures, this type of nozzle is often used for tank cleaning, either as a fixed position compound spray nozzle or as a rotary nozzle. File:Plain orifice nozzle.pngalt=Plain orifice spray nozzlePlain orifice spray nozzle =Shaped-orifice nozzle= The shaped orifice uses a semispherical shaped inlet and a V notched outlet to cause the flow to spread out on the axis of the V notch. A flat fan spray results which is useful for many spray applications, such as spray painting. File:Flat fan nozzle.pngalt=Flat fan spray nozzleFlat fan spray pattern spray nozzle =Surface-impingement single-fluid nozzle= A surface impingement nozzle causes a stream of liquid to impinge on a surface resulting in a sheet of liquid that breaks up into drops. This flat fan spray pattern nozzle is used in many applications ranging from applying agricultural herbicides to row crop to painting. The impingement surface can be formed in a spiral to yield a spiral shaped sheet approximating a full cone spray pattern or a hollow-cone spray pattern.J. U. Bete, Spray Nozzles, US Patent 2,804,341, 1956 The spiral design generally produces a smaller drop size than pressure swirl type nozzle design, for a given pressure and flow rate. This design is clog resistant due to the large free passage. Common applications include gas scrubbing applications (e.g., flue-gas desulfurization where the smaller droplets often offer superior performance) and fire fighting (where the mix of droplet densities allow spray penetration through strong thermal currents). File:Impg nozzle.pngSurface impingement spray nozzle File:spiral impingement nozzle.pngSpiral spray nozzle =Pressure-swirl single-fluid spray nozzle= Pressure-swirl spray nozzles are high-performance (small drop size) devices with one configuration shown. The stationary core induces a rotary fluid motion which causes the swirling of the fluid in the swirl chamber. A film is discharged from the perimeter of the outlet orifice producing a characteristic hollow cone spray pattern. Air or other surrounding gas is drawn inside the swirl chamber to form an air core within the swirling liquid. Many configurations of fluid inlets are used to produce this hollow cone pattern depending on the nozzle capacity and materials of construction. The uses of this nozzle include evaporative cooling and spray drying. File:swirl nozzle.pngPressure swirl spray nozzle File:Spillback Nozzle.jpgSpillback Nozzle =Solid-cone single-fluid nozzle= One of the configurations of the solid cone spray nozzle is shown in a schematic diagram. A swirling liquid motion is induced with the vane structure, however; the discharge flow fills the entire outlet orifice. For the same capacity and pressure drop, a full cone nozzle will produce a larger drop size than a hollow cone nozzle. The coverage is the desired feature for such a nozzle, which is often used for applications to distribute fluid over an area. =Compound nozzle= A compound nozzle is a type of nozzle in which several individual single or two fluid nozzles are incorporated into one nozzle body, as shown below. This allows design control of drop size and spray coverage angle. File:Compound nozzle.pngalt=Compound spray nozzleCompound pressure swirl spray nozzle with wide pattern Two-fluid nozzles Two-fluid nozzles atomize by causing the interaction of high velocity gas and liquid. Compressed air is most often used as the atomizing gas, but sometimes steam or other gases are used. The many varied designs of two-fluid nozzles can be grouped into internal mix or external mix depending on the mixing point of the gas and liquid streams relative to the nozzle face. = Internal-mix two-fluid nozzles = Internal mix nozzles contact fluids inside the nozzle; one configuration is shown in the figure above. Shearing between high velocity gas and low velocity liquid disintegrates the liquid stream into droplets, producing a high velocity spray. This type of nozzle tends to use less atomizing gas than an external mix atomizer and is better suited to higher viscosity streams. Many compound internal-mix nozzles are commercially used; e.g., for fuel oil atomization. =External-mix two-fluid nozzles= External mix nozzles contacts fluids outside the nozzle as shown in the schematic diagram. This type of spray nozzle may require more atomizing air and a higher atomizing air pressure drop because the mixing and atomization of liquid takes place outside the nozzle. The liquid pressure drop is lower for this type of nozzle, sometimes drawing liquid into the nozzle due to the suction caused by the atomizing air nozzles (siphon nozzle). If the liquid to be atomized contains solids an external mix atomizer may be preferred. This spray may be shaped to produce different spray patterns. A flat pattern is formed with additional air ports to flatten or reshape the circular spray cross-section discharge. Control of two-fluid nozzles Many applications use two-fluid nozzles to achieve a controlled small drop size over a range of operation. Each nozzle has a performance curve, and the liquid and gas flow rates determine the drop size.Pagcatipunan, C., Schick, R., Maximize the Performance of Spray Nozzle Systems, Chem. Engr. Progr., December 2005. Excessive drop size can lead to catastrophic equipment failure or may have an adverse effect on the process or product. For example, the gas conditioning tower in a cement plant often utilizes evaporative cooling caused by water atomized by two-fluid nozzles into the dust laden gas. If drops do not completely evaporate and strike a vessel wall dust will accumulate, resulting in the potential for flow restriction in the outlet duct, disrupting the plant operation. File:IMTF wiki.pngInternal mix two- fluid spray nozzle File:EM TF wiki.pngExternal mix two-fluid spray nozzle File:Laval Nozzle.JPGTwinFluid Nozzle Rotary atomizers Rotary atomizers use a high speed rotating disk, cup or wheel to discharge liquid at high speed to the perimeter, forming a hollow cone spray. The rotational speed controls the drop size. Spray drying and spray painting are the most important and common uses of this technology.  Ultrasonic atomizers  This type of spray nozzle utilizes high frequency (20‚Äì180 kHz) vibration to produce narrow drop- size distribution and low velocity spray from a liquid. The vibration of a piezoelectric crystal causes capillary waves on the nozzle surface liquid film. An Ultrasonic nozzle can be key to high transfer efficiency and process stability as they are very hard to clog. They are particularly useful in medical device coatings for their reliability. Ultrasonic Spray Nozzle  Electrostatic  Electrostatic charging of sprays is very useful for high transfer efficiency. Examples are the industrial spraying of coatings (paint) and applying lubricant oils. The charging is at high voltage (20‚Äì40 kV) but low current.  Nozzle performance factorsLefebvre, Arthur, Atomization and Sprays, Hemisphere, 1989,  =Liquid properties= Almost all drop size data supplied by nozzle manufacturers are based on spraying water under laboratory conditions, . The effect of liquid properties should be understood and accounted for when selecting a nozzle for a process that is drop size sensitive. =Temperature= Liquid temperature changes do not directly affect nozzle performance, but can affect viscosity, surface tension, and specific gravity, which can then influence spray nozzle performance. = Specific gravity = Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a given volume of liquid to the mass of the same volume of water. In spraying, the main effect of the specific gravity Sg of a liquid other than water is on the capacity of the spray nozzle. All vendor-supplied performance data for nozzles are based on spraying water. To determine the volumetric flowrate Q, of a liquid other than water the following equation should be used. :{Q_f} = {Q_{water}}\\\\sqrt \\\\frac{1}{Sg} = Viscosity = Dynamic viscosity is defined as the property of a liquid that resists change in the shape or arrangement of its elements during flow. Liquid viscosity primarily affects spray pattern formation and drop size. Liquids with a high viscosity require a higher minimum pressure to begin spray pattern formation and yield narrower spray angles compared to water. =Surface tension= The surface tension of a liquid tends to assume the smallest possible size, acting as a membrane under tension. Any portion of the liquid surface exerts a tension upon adjacent portions or upon other objects that it contacts. This force is in the plane of the surface, and its amount per unit of length is surface tension. The value for water is about 0.073 N/m at 21 ¬∞C. The main effects of surface tension are on minimum operating pressure, spray angle, and drop size. Surface tension is more apparent at low operating pressures. A higher surface tension reduces the spray angle, particularly on hollow cone nozzles. Low surface tensions can allow nozzles to be operated at lower pressures. =Nozzle wear= Nozzle wear is indicated by an increase in nozzle capacity and by a change in the spray pattern, in which the distribution (uniformity of spray pattern) deteriorates and increases drop size. Choice of a wear-resistant material of construction increases nozzle life. Because many single fluid nozzles are used to meter flows, worn nozzles result in excessive liquid usage. =Material of construction= The material of construction is selected based on the fluid properties of the liquid that is to be sprayed and the environment surrounding the nozzle. Spray nozzles are most commonly fabricated from metals, such as brass, Stainless steel, and nickel alloys, but plastics such as PTFE and PVC and ceramics (alumina and silicon carbide) are also used. Several factors must be considered, including erosive wear, chemical attack, and the effects of high temperature. Applications Automotive coating: automotive coating demands droplet from 10-100 micron size uniformly deposited on substrate. Applications of spray technology are more pronounced during the course of base and clear coatings process which are encompassed as the last stages in automotive coating. Among others rotary bells mounted on robots and hvlp (high volume, low pressure) sprayers are widely used Spray drying See also * Nozzle * Nebulizer * Pesticide application * Ilass Institute for Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems *Spray bottle References Category:Nozzles Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Spray nozzle"},{"id":"8874593","text":"Pie≈°≈•any Airport is an airport serving spa town of Pie≈°≈•any, Slovakia.

The loaf is characterised by its shape, which is essentially that of two round loaves, one on top of the other, with the upper one being smaller: the shape is similar to that of the French brioche and the pain chapeau of Finist√®re.Davidson, A. The Oxford companion to food, OUP, 2006, p.99 The origins of the name and shape are unknown but possibly extend back hundreds of years. Elizabeth David, who described the cottage loaf in her English Bread and Yeast Cookery, surmised that the shape may have arisen as a way of saving 'floor space' in old-fashioned bread ovens. The name, however, did not first appear in writing until the mid 19th century.Ayto, J.

This family is commonly known as the \\"top-snails\\" because in many species the shell resembles a toy spinning top. Anatomy The animal is similar in general form to the Turbinidae. The top snails are characterized by some primitive traits: a heart with two atria. They have retained only one kidney and the second osphradium has been lost in the course of evolution. The mantle cavity contains a single gill. Along the side of the foot are three or more pairs of sensory epipodial tentacles. The head has a short, broad rostrum. The intertentacular lobes are simple or digitated, separate or united across the front, sometimes obsolete. The jaws are developed or absent. The radula is rhipidoglossate. The rhachidian teeth are always present and well- developed. The lateral teeth generally number 5 on each side, sometimes more numerous. The marginal teeth are narrow and very numerous. Description The length of an adult shell varies between 5 mm and 130 mm. There is also a wide variation in the shape of the shell. This goes from low auriform (ear-shaped) with a wide aperture to the long, slender conical forms of typical top shells. The shape may also be subglobose, turbinate or helicoid. Their height may vary between 3 mm and 152 mm. The shell contains only a few whorls. These have a highly variable exterior, ranging from smooth or glossy to sculptured. The internal shell is nacreous. They have a brown, entirely corneous, circular, multispiral operculum which fits the aperture snugly. The operculum is formed of numerous gradually increasing whorls with a central nucleus. The aperture may be entire, tetragonal or rounded and has no reflected lip. The peristome is generally not continuous. These shells are often brightly colored and adorned with darker bands. The Trochidae differ from the Turbinidae in having a corneous, never calcareous, operculum, which is always multispiral.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Habitat Most species in the family live either in the intertidal zone or in the shallow subtidal zone, but some live in deeper water. They are usually abundant on solid, suitable substrates, like rocky shores and reefs.Poutiers, J. M. (1998). Gastropods in: FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes: The living marine resources of the Western Central Pacific Volume 1. Seaweeds, corals, bivalves and gastropods. Rome, FAO, 1998. page 399. Distribution This family has a worldwide distribution in tropical, temperate and arctic waters. Members of this family are among the most common marine snails along the rocky shores of Europe. Ecology =Life cycle= The Trochidae are dioecious, and the fertilization occurs externally by the release of eggs and sperm. Top snail eggs are laid individually or in gelatinous egg masses in the water. Individuals may hatch as free-swimming planktonic larvae or juvenile crawlers with a short swimming stage. =Feeding behavior= This family of snails consists of herbivores, grazing with their radulae on rocky surfaces, feeding on algae and vegetable detritus, and more rarely by filter-feeding, as observed in the genus Umbonium.  Taxonomy  = 2005 taxonomy = This family consists of six following subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005): *Trochinae Rafinesque, 1815  tribe Trochini Rafinesque, 1815 \\\\- synonym: Pyramidinae Gray, 1847  tribe Cantharidini Gray, 1857  tribe Monodontini Gray, 1857 \\\\- synonym: Gibbulinae Stoliczka, 1868 *Halistilynae Keen, 1958 *Lirulariinae Hickman & McLean, 1990 *Margaritinae Thiele, 1924  tribe Margaritini Thiele, 1924 \\\\- synonym: Margaritinae Stoliczka, 1868 (inv.)  tribe Gazini Hickman & McLean, 1990  tribe Kaiparathinini Marshall, 1993 *Stomatellinae Gray, 1840 \\\\- synonyms: Stomatiidae Carpenter, 1861, Stomatellidae Gray, 1840 *Umboniinae H.

He had also been a member of the England Academy team. In 2008, he played for Leicestershire on loan because he was unable to break into Lancashire's first team. He is an all- rounder, bowling right-arm medium and batting left-handed. At the start of the 2009 season, Smith was promoted to open the batting, having previously batted in the lower order, and secured his place there. In 2011, the year Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since 1950, Smith became the first Lancashire player to score a century and take four wickets in the same one-day match. In 2011/12 Smith played for the Matabeleland Tuskers in Zimbabwe as an overseas player in the domestic twenty20 competition. Career =Breakthrough= Smith started out at his local team Withnell Fold at an early age. Smith received the NBC Denis Compton Award for the most promising Lancashire player in 2005 and 2006. His Lancashire debut came late in 2005, but he made his big breakthrough in 2006. Smith previously attended Parklands High School in Chorley and Runshaw College in Leyland and played for cricket clubs in Withnell Fold and Chorley Cricket Club. =Leicestershire loan= Late in April 2008, Smith suffered a thigh injury which prevented him from playing for seven weeks. In late June 2008, Smith signed a contract with Leicestershire ‚Äì who were in the second division of the County Championship ‚Äì to play on loan from Lancashire for a month. Lancashire had a full strength bowling attack ‚Äì including Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson who had returned from England duty ‚Äì and Smith was unable to break into the side. Smith explained that \\"I am Lancashire born and bred and I want to play for Lancashire for all of my career. I'm just going to get some cricket and make sure I am ticking over well\\". He was immediately drafted into the Leicestershire side. In 6 first-class matches for Leicestershire, Smith scored 228 at an average of 32.57 ‚Äì including one half-century ‚Äì and took 13 wickets at an average of 38.23; ¬∑ in the 3 one-day matches he played for Leicestershire, Smith scored 62 runs at 31.00 ‚Äì including a half-century ‚Äì and took 4 wickets at 33.00. ¬∑ While playing for Leicestershire, Smith scored his maiden first-class and one-day half-centuries. Batting at number 8 against Warwickshire at the start of August 2008, Smith scored 63, beating his previous highest score of 49. On 3 August, Smith scored 52 against Yorkshire while batting at number 6, beating his previous best one-day score of 30. =Opening batsman= On his return to Lancashire from Leicestershire, manager Mike Watkinson was impressed by Smith's performances with the bat and ball. Smith's contract with the club was renewed, along with nine other young players who were expected to form the basis of Lancashire's squad in the future. Smith stated his intent to cement his place in the Lancashire side as an all-rounder, saying that \\"My batting has come on in leaps and I would like to think of myself as more of an allrounder. I batted in the top six at Leicestershire in the limited-over games and at seven in the four-dayers, and I got 50-plus a couple of times and had a run average of about 40. After the responsibility there I know I can do it.\\" In Lancashire's opening first-class match of the 2009 season, Smith scored his maiden century. In a match against Durham University, he opened the batting in the second innings and scored 104 runs from 166 balls, beating his previous highest first-class score of 63. Following this successful innings, Smith was again promoted to open the innings with Kyle Hogg in a one-day match against Glamorgan. With Mal Loye absent with a calf injury, Smith scored 66 runs from 90 balls ‚Äì beating his previous best listA score of 52 ‚Äì as Lancashire won by 80 runs. Originally a stop-gap opener, when Loye recovered from injury in early June, Smith's success at the top of the order initially kept him out of the team, and even when Loye secured a place in the side again Smith remained as opener. In mid-June, Smith suffered a side strain which prevented him from playing for six weeks. By this point of the season, Smith had experienced success as an opener in the limited-over matches, scoring half centuries in one-day and Twenty20 matches, although his batting average in first-class matches was a disappointing 8.50 from four matches. Moores backed Smith to succeed in the long form of the game, stating \\"We've backed Tom to do it because it balances our team and he has shown he is a very good player. I think we've seen that in the one-day stuff. I think Tom is playing well. You judge a player on how he's playing. Tom's developing and learning quickly. Technically, he stands up tall and plays up the ground which is what you want your openers to do\\". During a Roses Match in late July, Smith took career best figures of 6/46, his maiden first-class five-wicket haul. Smith and Paul Horton then proceeded to share in their highest opening partnership in the County Championship. After the match, Smith commented \\"I am really enjoying the opening role. In one-day cricket especially it is great, but opening in any form of the game I am enjoying\\". Moores' faith in Smith's batting was further repaid in a match against Hampshire, when Smith scored 95; however, in the match Smith suffered a stomach strain. This coincided with injuries to Glen Chapple, Steven Cheetham, and Sajid Mahmood and with Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson on England duty, Lancashire's bowling attack was severely depleted. As a stop-gap measure, Tom Lungley was loaned by Lancashire from Derbyshire County Cricket Club. At the start of the 2010 season, Smith managed just 24 runs from his first six innings opening for Lancashire. Consequentially, he was moved to the middle order, where he rediscovered his form. In his second match after moving down the order, Smith scored his maiden century in the County Championship. After his success, he stated that he would like to regain the opening position. Despite struggling for runs in first- class cricket at the start of the season, Smith was Lancashire's leading run- scorer in T20 cricket in 2010 with 543 runs from 17 matches, nearly 150 runs more than his nearest competitor, Steven Croft. While Lancashire was knocked out in the quarter-finals of the competition, Smith scored three half- centuries including a personal best of 92 not out against Worcestershire; he finished as the competition's fourth-highest run-scorer for 2010. Smith also claimed 13 wickets in the T20 competition. In June 2010, Smith reached the landmark of 100 first-class wickets when he dismissed Jonny Bairstow in a drawn Roses match. At the start of August, Smith was awarded his county cap by Lancashire. Lancashire failed to progress beyond the group stages of the 2011 CB40 but in their final match of the competition Smith scored his maiden one- day century (117). In same match he took 4/48 to help his side to a two-run over Nottinghamshire, and in the process became the first Lancashire player to score a century and take four wickets in a one-day match. In the final match of the season, Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since 1950. With the English cricket season concluded, in November Smith travelled to Zimbabwe to play for the Matabeleland Tuskers in the country's domestic twenty20 competition, the Stanbic Bank 20 Series. In seven matches for the Tuskers he scored 145 runs with a single half-century, and took three wickets while conceding 203 runs. In May 2012, Smith tore a hamstring, side-lining him for at least a month. In January 2017, Smith announced his retirement from professional cricket after a series of injury problems.

During the epoch of mass migrations of European labourers at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, anarchist ideas started to spread, particularly amongst the country‚Äôs labour movement. Along with the labour migrants, many Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and German political exiles arrived, many holding anarchist or anarcho-syndicalist ideas. Some did not come as exiles but rather as a type of political entrepreneur, including Giovanni Rossi, who founded an anarchist commune in 1889, named the colony of Cec√≠lia, in the interior of Paran√° state. The experiment only lasted a few years, but at one point consisted of 200 participants, mostly Italian migrants with urban labour backgrounds who had difficulties learning to work the land.  Anarcho-syndicalist labour movement, press and schools  upright=1.7 Along with European immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries came their anarchist ideas. These immigrants joined trade unions and supported anarcho-syndicalism by the 1920s, which led to labor reforms including increases in pay. Unions from Rio, S√£o Paulo, and Porto Alegre united in the Brazilian Workers' Confederation (Confedera√ß√£o Oper√°ria Brasileira, or COB) in 1908, as the result of a successful Workers' Congress. Anarchism or anarcho-syndicalism was the dominant ideology underpinning the Brazilian labour movement at the beginning of the twentieth century. Syndicates and labour federations were erected, mainly pressing for shorter workdays, better working conditions and higher salaries. Various strikes, i.e. in the harbour of Santos and among railway workers, were inspired by anarchist sympathies. In 1906 the first nationwide Brazilian workers' congress was held, and from then on the May Day celebrations, with prominent anarchists delivering speeches, started to attract large crowds. The second national workers' congress in 1913 was initially meant to be a Pan-American anarchist congress, but only two Argentinians showed up. The labour agitation eventually culminated in the large strike movements of 1917 and 1919, biggest in S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but echoed throughout the country. Alongside the labour federations, anarchist daily and weekly newspapers were also issued; additionally, educational centres, theatres and elementary schools were founded. In the nineteenth century some of those newspapers were in Italian and a few were in Spanish and German, but at the turn of the century most were in Portuguese. A Plebe was an important one, but there were many more, issued in virtually any state capital of Brazil. The educational centres, schools and theatres founded by anarchists helped to draw attention to the issue of illiteracy in Brazil. This was a point taken up by various other groups in society, such as social Christian movements, inspired by Catholic social teachings, and various politicians aiming for containment of the social question or for popular support.  Repression, fragmentation and decline  Anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists and socialists of various kinds were generally much less fragmented in Brazil than in, for example, Italy. However, the many pamphlets and essays in anarchist newspapers show that there were fierce debates about ideology and strategy between adherents of different schools. The (mostly moderate) socialists rejected strongly the position of the emerging 'socialist Christians' on strikes and labour unions, around 1900. Ongoing debate, especially on the necessity and danger of (central) organisation, between anarchists, libertarians and syndicalists filled the labour-based newspapers. In 1922, some militants who had been active in anarchist circles founded the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB), influenced by the success of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and by the feeling of failure, in appeal and unity, of the syndicalist workers' federations. Among them, Astrojildo Pereira, Octovia Brand√£o, Bernardo Canelas, Jose Elias da Silva. Others, like Jos√© Oiticica and Edgard Leuenroth, stayed loyal to anarchist principles. The party was not recognised as communist by the Comintern, however, being accused of being a doctrinal mess, still retaining much anarcho-syndicalist influence. Anarchist protest in S√£o Paulo, protesting the World Cup Repression of the anarchist movement, and of the labour movement in general, was very harsh. The violent police repression of strikes caused many casualties. Also, newspaper and union offices and even children‚Äôs schools were burned down. Furthermore, anarchist agitators were regularly arrested, and, if not Brazilian-born, exiled. Under the government of Artur Bernardes even concentration camps and torture centres existed, of which the most infamous was Clevel√¢ndia, in Oiapoque, at the border with French Guiana. While some argue that the anarchist movement had already lost out against the communists by the 1920s, others, like Edgar Rodrigues, maintain that the anarchist movement actually kept growing during most of the 1920s, until the repression by Bernardes. In any case, the military populist movement, known as tenentismo eventually won out. The repression by the Vargas regime, along with the introduction of the Mussolini-inspired state-led union structure in the 1930s, proved the death-knell of the Brazilian anarchist movement. Some traces of anarchism remained, notably the Anarchist Study Centre in Rio de Janeiro led by prof. Jos√© Oiticica, which had to go underground after the 1964 military coup. In the 1970s a small anarchist newspaper existed in Bahia, called \\"The Enemy of the King\\" (Portuguese: O inimigo do rei), but the movement would never regain the strength it had at the beginning of the twentieth century. In the 1990s, especifismo influenced anarchism spread to Brazil under the influence of the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation (, or FAU) and saw the creation of regional groups such as the Ga√∫cha Anarchist Federation (, or FAG). In 2002 especifismo influenced groups based in nine states would found the Forum of Organized Anarchism (F√≥rum do Anarquismo Organizado, or FAO) which in 2012 would become the Brazilian Anarchist Coordination (Coordena√ß√£o Anarquista Brasileira, or CAB).

It occurred near Palembang, on Sumatra, on 13‚Äì15 February 1942. The Royal Dutch Shell oil refineries at nearby Pladju (or Pladjoe) were the major objectives for the Empire of Japan in the Pacific War, because of an oil embargo imposed on Japan by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom after the Japanese invaded China and committed massive atrocities such as the rape of Nanking. With the area's abundant fuel supply and airfield, Palembang offered significant potential as a military base to both the Allies and the Japanese. Prelude In January, the American-British-Dutch- Australian Command (ABDACOM) decided to concentrate Allied air forces in Sumatra at two airfields near Palembang: Pangkalan Benteng, also known as \\"P1\\" and a secret air base at Prabumulih (Praboemoelih), or \\"P2\\". The British Royal Air Force created No. 225 (Bomber) Group at Palembang. It included two Royal Australian Air Force squadrons and a large number of Australians serving with British squadrons. The group could only muster 40 Bristol Blenheim light bombers and 35 Lockheed Hudson light bombers. The Blenheims had flown from the Middle East and Egypt, where they were considered too old to cope with newer German and Italian fighters. (A handful of United States Far East Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers also operated out of Palembang briefly in January, but these were withdrawn to Java and Australia before the battle commenced.) No. 226 (Fighter) Group RAF also arrived at Palembang in early February: two squadrons of Hawker Hurricanes transported to Sumatra by the aircraft carrier . They were joined by the remnants of British, Australian and Royal New Zealand Air Force Hurricane and Brewster Buffalo squadrons, which had both inflicted and suffered heavy losses in intense air battles over the Malayan and Singapore campaigns. The Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) South Sumatra Island Territorial Command, its command in the Palembang area, consisted of about 2,000 troops under Lieutenant Colonel L. N. W. Vogelesang: the South Sumatra Garrison Battalion and a Stadswacht/Landstorm (\\"home guard/reserve\\") infantry company in Palembang, a Stadswacht/Landstorm infantry company in Jambi (Djambi), as well as various artillery and machine gun units. (KNIL units in other parts of Sumatra lacked mobility and played no part in the fighting.) The Royal Netherlands Navy was represented by the minelayer Pro Patria and the patrol boats P-38 and P-40 on the Musi river. Battle =Airborne attack= While the Allied planes attacked the Japanese ships on 13 February, Kawasaki Ki-56 transport planes of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Chutai, Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF), dropped Teishin Shudan (Raiding Group) paratroopers over Pangkalan Benteng airfield. At the same time Mitsubishi Ki-21 bombers from the 98th Sentai dropped supplies for paratroopers. The formation was escorted by a large force of Nakajima Ki-43 fighters from the 59th and 64th Sentai. As many as 180 men from the Japanese 2nd Parachute Regiment, under Colonel Seiichi Kume, dropped between Palembang and Pangkalan Benteng, and more than 90 men came down west of the refineries at Pladjoe. Although the Japanese paratroopers failed to capture the Pangkalan Benteng airfield, they did manage to gain possession of the entire Pladjoe oil refinery complex undamaged. A makeshift counter-attack by Landstorm troops and anti-aircraft gunners from Praboemoelih managed to retake the complex but took heavy losses. The planned demolition failed to do any serious damage to the refinery, but the oil stores were set ablaze. Two hours after the first drop, another 60 Japanese paratroopers were dropped near Pangkalan Benteng airfield. On 14 February, the surviving Japanese paratroopers advanced to the Musi, Salang and Telang rivers, near Palembang. =Amphibious assault= The main Japanese invasion force, an amphibious assault fleet under Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), was on its way from Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina. It was made up of the Imperial Japanese Army's 229th Infantry Regiment and one battalion from the 230th Infantry Regiment. A small advance party set out eight transports escorted by the light cruiser Sendai and four destroyers. The main force followed in 14 transports, escorted by the heavy cruiser Chokai and four destroyers. The covering force included the aircraft carrier Ryujo, four heavy cruisers, one light cruiser and three destroyers. Additional air cover was provided by land-based IJN planes and the IJAAF 3rd Air Division. On the morning of 13 February, a river boat commandeered by the British Royal Navy, HMS Li Wo ‚Äî under Lieutenant Thomas Wilkinson ‚Äî ferrying personnel and equipment between Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, ran into the Japanese fleet. Although Li Wo was armed only with a 4-inch (100 mm) gun and two machineguns, its crew fired at the Japanese troop transport ships, setting one on fire and damaging several others, while under fire from the Japanese cruisers. This action continued for 90 minutes until the Li Wo ran out of ammunition. Wilkinson then ordered the ramming of the nearest transport, before his ship was destroyed by Japanese fire. Wilkinson received a posthumous Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the British Commonwealth, and the only VC awarded in the Dutch East Indies campaign. On 15 February, an ABDA naval force of five cruisers, HNLMS De Ruyter, and HNLMS Tromp, , HMAS Hobart and 10 destroyers, under Admiral Karel Doorman, made an abortive attempt to intercept the Japanese force. Planes from Ryujo and land-based aircraft made a series of attacks on the Allied ships, forcing them to withdraw to the south of Sumatra. As the Japanese landing force approached Sumatra, the remaining Allied aircraft attacked it, and the Japanese transport ship Otawa Maru was sunk. Hurricanes flew up the rivers, machine-gunning Japanese landing craft. However, on the afternoon of 15 February, all Allied aircraft were ordered to Java, where a major Japanese attack was anticipated, and the Allied air units had withdrawn from southern Sumatra by the evening of 16 February 1942. Other personnel were evacuated via Oosthaven (now Bandar Lampung) by ships to Java or India. Port facilities at Oosthaven was destroyed by scorched-earth policy References  Category:Conflicts in 1942 Category:1942 in Indonesia Category:South West Pacific theatre of World War II Category:Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving the Netherlands Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan B Category:Battles of World War II involving Australia Category:Battles of World War II involving New Zealand Category:Airborne operations of World War II Category:Palembang Category:1942 in the Dutch East Indies Category:February 1942 events ","title":"Battle of Palembang"},{"id":"8874700","text":"Recognition may refer to: *Award, something given in recognition of an achievement In science and technology =In computer science= *Pattern recognition, a branch of machine learning which encompasses the meanings below Biometric *Recognition of human individuals, or biometrics, used as a form of identification and access control Facial recognition system, a system to identify individuals by their facial characteristics  Fingerprint recognition, automated method of verifying a match between two human fingerprints  Handwritten biometric recognition, identifies the author of specific handwriting, offline (static) or in real-time (dynamic)  Iris recognition, a method of biometric identification Linguistic *Language identification, the problem of identifying which natural language given content is in *Natural language understanding, the parsing of the meaning of text *Speech recognition, the conversion of spoken words into text *Speaker recognition, the recognition of a speaker from their voice Textual *Handwriting recognition, the conversion of handwritten text into machine- encoded text *Magnetic ink character recognition, used mainly by the banking industry *Optical character recognition, the conversion of typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text Automatic number plate recognition, the use of optical character recognition to read vehicle registration plates Other meanings in computer science *Activity recognition, the recognition of events from videos or sensors *Gesture recognition, the interpretation of human gestures *Named entity recognition, the classification of elements in text into predefined categories *Object recognition *Optical mark recognition, the capturing of human-marked data from document forms *Sound recognition =In neuroscience and psychology= *Visual object recognition *Face perception, the process by which the human brain understands and interprets the face *Pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon in which a vague stimulus is perceived as significant *Recall (memory), the retrieval of events or information from the past *Emotion recognition *Pattern recognition (psychology) =In other sciences= *Recognition (sociology), a public acknowledgement of person's status or merits *Antigen recognition, in immunology *Intra-species recognition, the recognition of another member of the same species *Molecular recognition, the interaction between two or more molecules through non-covalent bonding In arts and entertainment *\\"The Recognition\\", a science fiction short story by J.

The 18 AP-3C Orions were upgraded from P-3Cs between 1997 and 2005, with the program taking three years longer than expected due to systems integration problems. All 18 AP-3C Orions are operated by No. 92 Wing which is based at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. Aircraft from the wing have seen service as part of Australian Defence Force operations in Australia, South East Asia and the Middle East. Development The AP-3C Orion project began in the early 1990s to upgrade the radar and mission systems on 18 of Australia's 19 P-3C-II Orions. L3 Communications completed the prototype AP-3C at its facility at Greenville, Texas. The other 17 aircraft were upgraded at Avalon Airport in Australia under a sub-contract to Australian companies. Tenix Defence took over the project in mid-2003 and BAE Systems was involved with many of the aircraft's sub-systems and developing a simulation facility. Work began on the first AP-3C in January 1997 and the original project schedule called for this aircraft to be provided to the RAAF for operational acceptance trials in March 1998 and all upgrades to be completed by the end of 2001. The remaining 19th Orion was not included in the upgrade program, and the Australian military stated in 2005 that it is \\"used for development purposes\\". When the Australian Orion upgrade project was being developed in 1996 there was not an 'off the shelf' package of upgrades that met the requirements specified by the RAAF. As a result, it was decided to tailor the upgrade to Australian specifications, which included integrating different systems. The systems integration task proved to be much more difficult than was expected, and L3 Communications and its suppliers were required to write over two million lines of software code. As a result of the systems integration problems delivery of upgraded Orions was delayed by three years. The first two aircraft were handed over to the RAAF in December 2001 and the final AP-3C was delivered in early 2005. This delay caused a major reduction in the RAAF's maritime surveillance capability, and in February 2001 only nine of the RAAF's 17 Orions were operational. Capabilities An AP-3C at Canberra Airport in 2005 Two crewmen loading sonobuoys on board an AP-3C The AP-3C upgrade improved the Orions' radar, intelligence-gathering and computing systems. The upgrade included fitting each aircraft with a new Elta EL/M-2022(V)3 radar, a nose-mounted Star Safire III electro-optical and infrared system, \\"highly capable\\" signals and electronic intelligence (SIGINT/ELINT) equipment, the UYS 503 acoustic system, a new automatic information system processor, a new navigation system based on two Honeywell H764G Embedded GPS/INUs, a new communications system and other improvements. The Orions' weight was also reduced by more than as part of the upgrade. The AP-3Cs' new radar and electronic surveillance system greatly increased the capabilities of the RAAF's Orion fleet. These new systems allow the Orions to detect and identify more targets and at longer range. In 2002 the then-Chief of Air Force Air Vice Marshal Angus Houston claimed that the AP-3Cs were the best maritime patrol aircraft in the world and The Australian reported that they were superior to the United States Navy's Orions, though an upgrade was planned for the USN's Orion fleet. There has been speculation that one or more of the AP-3Cs was fitted with additional SIGINT/ELINT capabilities and operate as specialised intelligence-gathering aircraft. An article in the magazine Australian Aviation in December 2007 stated that this is probably not correct, and it is more likely that several SIGINT/ELINT 'kits' were purchased and can be swapped between all 18 airframes. The magazine also quoted an unnamed 'industry source' as stating that all the AP-3Cs have SIGINT/ELINT capabilities \\"equivalent or better\\" than those of the Royal Air Force's specialised Hawker Siddeley Nimrod surveillance aircraft. Jane's World Air Forces states that the RAAF's 19th Orion was converted to an EP-3 signals reconnaissance aircraft in 1997, however, and was operational as late as 2009. The aircraft are equipped with AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Mark 46 or MU90 Impact torpedoes, mines, and a range of sonar buoys and other stores. AP-3C Orions have a normal crew complement of 13, broken down as follows: * two pilots (captain and co-pilot) * two flight engineers * tactical co- ordinator * navigator/communication officer * sensor employment manager * six airborne electronic analysts. In addition to their traditional maritime surveillance role, AP-3Cs have been equipped for over-land surveillance roles. As of 2007, the RAAF's two-aircraft Orion detachment in the Middle East was spending 60 percent of its flying time conducting intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance over Iraq. On 14 May 2007 BAE Systems Australia was awarded an $76.1 million contract to provide an upgraded electronic support measures (ESM) system for the Orions. The contract involved replacing existing sub-systems and ground support systems from 2011. In 2008 the Australian Government awarded contracts for further enhancements to the AP-3C fleet. Under this project 18 Orions were to be equipped with new electro-optical/infrared sensors, tactical common datalinks and video recorders by 2011. Operational history Two AP-3C Orions in July 2010 All AP-3Cs were assigned to No. 92 Wing RAAF, which forms part of the air force's Surveillance and Response Group. Each of the 18 aircraft is permanently allocated to either No. 10 Squadron or No. 11 Squadron rather than being placed in a wing-owned pool. AP-3C aircraft are also used by the RAAF's Orion operational conversion unit, No. 292 Squadron, for training flights. The AP-3Cs have seen extensive operational service. The first operational deployment of one of the upgraded aircraft was conducted in late 2002, when an AP-3C assigned to No. 10 Squadron flew border protection patrols from Darwin. The Orions have subsequently formed an important part of Operation Resolute, the Australian Defence Force's contribution to patrolling Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone. As part of this operation Orions fly regular missions around Australia's western and northern approaches and report the results of their patrols to Maritime Border Command. AP-3Cs also periodically conduct patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of Malacca and South China Sea from RMAF Butterworth in Malaysia as part of Operation Gateway. A single AP-3C was also deployed to Pago Pago in American Samoa during November and December 2006 to support the Australian force deployed off Fiji in response to the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat. Further afield, a detachment of two AP-3Cs was based in the Middle East from 2003 until late 2012 as part of Australia's commitment to the War on Terrorism (Operation Slipper) and the Iraq War (Operation Catalyst). These aircraft conducted maritime surveillance patrols over the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea; providing support to Coalition warships and boarding parties; and conducting extensive overland flights of Iraq to support the Coalition ground forces there. By December 2007 the AP-3C detachment had conducted 1,200 sorties totaling more than 11,000 hours of flying. The aircraft also operated over Afghanistan conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, as well supporting counter-piracy operations in Somalia. This deployment ended in December 2012; by this time the aircraft had flown over 2,400 sorties; and more than 3,500 No. 92 Wing personnel had served in the Middle East. In February 2009 an AP-3C Orion conducted flights over the state of Victoria in which it used its sophisticated cameras to map the damage and destruction caused by the Black Saturday bushfires and to search for survivors. HMS Echo during MH370 searchalt=4-engined plane flies over ship In March 2014, four AP-3Cs participated in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. In December 2015, it was reported by the BBC that an AP-3C Orion aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force conducted freedom of navigation exercises over contested islands in the South China Sea. The Department of Defence released a statement stating that the Orion had conducted routine maritime patrols between 25 November and 4 December as part of a regular surveillance operation. The aircraft was operating as a part of Operation Gateway, Australia's \\"enduring contribution to the preservation of regional security and stability in South East Asia\\". In June 2017 the Australian Government announced that two AP-3C Orions would operate over Mindanao in the Philippines to gather intelligence for Filipino forces engaged in the Marawi crisis. Replacement The RAAF's Orions are being replaced by up to fifteen Boeing P-8 Poseidons and six to eight MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial vehicles between 2015 and 2018. One of the Orions was retired in 2012 or 2013. This aircraft, which was the only one to have not been upgraded to AP-3C status, was scrapped on 20 October 2014. At this time the RAAF planned to reduce the Orion fleet to 16 aircraft by the end of 2014 and retire the type in 2019.

Kearny High School serves students in grades 9-12 from the Linda Vista, Serra Mesa and Kearny Mesa communities. The school is part of the San Diego Unified School District. Kearny's mascot is the Komet. History Kearny High School is named after General Stephen Watts Kearny, who joined the U.S. Army at the time of the War of 1812 and served through the War with Mexico.PBS US-Mexican War Biographies; Fetzer, Leland, San Diego County Place Names A to Z, page 73, Sunbelt Publications, Inc., San Diego, A former military base on the land, Camp Kearny, was near where the current campus is located. Kearny High opened its doors in 1941 in Linda Vista. The original school was a building in the neighborhood before moving into what is now Montgomery Middle School located at 2470 Ulric Street San Diego, CA 92111. The Class of 1943, was the first graduating class. In September 1945, Army ROTC was introduced on-campus. In 1953 the high school moved to its present location on Wellington. The first class was in 1954, this is why the address is \\"1954 Komet Way.\\" Academics =Notable teachers= *Mary Viletta Hutchinson, b. in Kenesaw, Nebraska. Graduated from San Diego State University(BA) and Pomona College (MA). The class of 1965 dedicated the yearbook to her. Tess Gerritsen (an author noted below) wrote of Hutchinson's powerful and positive influence. *Maynard Glen Albertson (1918-2013), b. in Blackstone, Virginia. Joined the US Navy in 1937 and retired in 1957. He then graduated from San Diego State University and became a history teacher. He taught at Kearny for almost 20 years and had a profound influence on many who later followed him into the teaching profession.Obituary, 2013 = Small schools= During the 2004-2005 school year, Kearny transformed from a traditional high school into a campus with four specialized small schools, each with an emphasis on a different field of study. The schools are: * The School of Science, Connections and Technology (SCT) * The School of Digital Media Design (DMD) * The Stanley E. Foster School of Engineering, Innovation and Design (EID) * The School of College Connections (SCC) The small school system is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Kearny is one of three such small schools in the San Diego area, the other two being San Diego High School and Crawford Educational Complex. The class of 2005 was the first graduating class from Kearny's small school system. The small schools are distinct from one another with different principals, teaching staff and course requirements. Each school offers specialized classes only available through their specific program. =Curriculum= Kearny High uses a 4x4 block schedule, which means that students are able to complete four full classes a semester (fall term and spring term) totaling eight full classes a year, rather than the traditional six year-long courses. This enables students to complete a year‚Äôs full curriculum in a more condensed term and allows them to enroll in additional electives or ROP courses. Since Kearny has specialized academies, each school is able to offer a variety of elective courses not commonly taught in public schools. Each academy offers individual AP, ROP, and electives pertaining to their specific theme. All four schools have come together with a common emphasis on planetary changes and global warming, using various technological skills to educate the student body. Exclusive to Kearny High, students who display academic excellence are able to take Mesa Fast Track their junior and senior years. This program allows students to enroll in college courses at Mesa College for both high school and college credit during the school day, and further enables the students to succeed post high school. Athletics Kearny offers a wide array of sports: * Fall: Football, Cross Country, Women's Volleyball, Women's Tennis. * Winter: Soccer, Basketball, and Wrestling * Spring: Track and Field, Men's Volleyball, Badminton, Softball, Baseball, Men's Golf, Men's Tennis Kearny participates in California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) sports.

As the nephew of Chairman Mao Zedong, he acted as the liaison between Mao and the Communist Party's Central Committee in Mao's ailing years, when he was no longer able to regularly attend political functions. He was considered an ally to the radical political faction known as the Gang of Four. He was arrested soon after Mao's death after a political struggle ensued, and was sentenced to prison. Biography Born on 14 February 1941 in Dihua (now Urumqi), Mao Yuanxin is the son of Mao Zemin, a younger brother of Mao Zedong. Mao Zemin had joined the Communist Party in 1922 and was executed by a warlord in 1943. Sheng Shicai, governor of Xinjiang, had been aligned to the Chinese Communist Party and had at first welcomed Mao Zemin, but switched allegiance after Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Mao Yuanxin's mother was also arrested, and Yuanxin was born in jail.Page 11 -12, The Private Life of Chairman Mao, by Li Zhisui, Arrow Books 1996 After Mao Yuanxin's mother remarried, he was brought up as part of his uncle's family. In 1960, Mao Yuanxin was admitted to Tsinghua University, then transferred to the PLA Institute of Military Engineering and became politically important during the Cultural Revolution. In 1973 he became party secretary of Liaoning province and political commissar of Shenyang Military Region in 1974.Biographical Sketches in The Private Life of Chairman Mao By that time he had allied himself with Jiang Qing. In Shenyang he participated the Cultural Revolution, including leading a march of Red Guards to a military instillation in the Northeast. By 1975, when Mao was ailing from complications of Alzheimer's Disease and was no longer able to attend Central Committee meetings on a regular basis, Mao Yuanxin became the Chairman's liaison with the Politburo,Glossary of Names and Identities in Mao's Last Revolution, by Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals, Harvard University Press 2006. and he contributed to the temporary fall of Deng Xiaoping in 1976, as well as a series of other political manuoevers of the Gang of Four. During Mao Zedong's final years, Mao Yuanxin had a close relationship with the Gang of Four.Eldest Son: Zhou Enlai and the Making of Modern China, Han Suyin, 1994. page 413. Some historians believe that Mao Yuanxin relayed news to Mao that the April 1976 \\"Tiananmen Incident\\" was planned by Deng Xiaoping, which resulted in Mao's final break with Deng before the latter's purge. He was arrested along with other of their supporters following Mao's death in October 1976, and was sentenced to seventeen years in prison by court martial.Biographical Sketches in The Private Life of Chairman Mao Mao Yuanxin faded from public view after the end of the Cultural Revolution. He was released from prison in October 1993 after serving his sentence. He changed his name to Li Shi and worked in the Shanghai Automobile Industry Quality Testing Institute as a technician. He retired in 2001, and receives a pension in accordance with his \\"senior technician\\" qualification. He also receives treatment as a \\"martyr's family member\\" because of his father's manner of death. In October 2012, Mao Yuanxin visited Xichuan County in Henan to tour the progress of the South‚ÄìNorth Water Transfer Project. Mao Yuanxin also attended the 120 year commemoration of his uncle's birth in 2013, held in Hunan Province. Personal life Mao Yuanxin is married to Quan Xiufeng (), a former factory worker.

The ordinance bars Ahmadi Muslims, who are deemed Non-Muslims under the Pakistani constitution, from publicly practising the Islamic faith and also disallows them from using any Islamic texts for praying purposes. It is in addition to ‚Äì but separate from ‚Äì the 1974 Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan. While the Second Amendment declared that Ahmadis are non-Muslims, the Ordinance prohibits Ahmadis from identifying themselves as Muslims. The ordinance also debars Ahmadis from the use of any honorific titles and modes of address deemed specific to the Islamic community such as the greeting \\"As-salamu alaykum\\" (peace be upon you), reciting the Six Kalimas or the shahada (declaring belief in the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad) etc., from building mosques and calling the Adhan (call to prayer), from undertaking Muslim modes of worship, from worshipping in non-Ahmadi mosques or public prayer rooms, and from making any citations from the Quran and Muhammad's hadith. Punishment for anyone convicted of doing any of the above is imprisonment of up to three years and a fine. Ahmadis, who self-identify as Muslims and observe Islamic practices, claim that the Ordinance criminalises their everyday life.Government of Pakistan - Law for Ahmadis.

This law does not allow Ahmadi Muslims to call themselves Muslim or to \\"pose as Muslims\\", which are crimes punishable by three years in prison.

In psychology, excessively seeking for recognition is regarded as one of the defining traits of a narcissistic personality disorder. Another example of recognition is when some person is accorded some special status, such as title or classification. According to Charles Taylor, recognition of one's identity is both a fundamental need and a right, and non- or misrecognition is a form of oppression. In workplaces, some use recognition among peers or from managers to encourage employee engagement. Recognition at work has been proven to help motivate employees. Recognition has been found to be one of the most important ingredients in workplaces. It increases employee engagement, continuous improvement behaviour, trust in the organization, intention to stay and satisfaction with management. The three most common ways that employees wish to be recognized are a verbal thank-you (95%), personalized specific words of acknowledgement (92%) and a written thank-you (88%). Although these approaches are often not measured, it is encouraged that managers ask their employees how they most want to be recognized (the platium rule) versus how they would want to be recognized (the golden rule). Furthermore, many organizations have recognition programs in place, however it's not always how employees today most want to be recognized.

Function  CXCL13 is a small chemokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family. As its other names suggest, this chemokine is selectively chemotactic for B cells belonging to both the B-1 and B-2 subsets, and elicits its effects by interacting with chemokine receptor CXCR5. CXCL13 and its receptor CXCR5 control the organization of B cells within follicles of lymphoid tissues. and is expressed highly in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and gut of humans. The gene for CXCL13 is located on human chromosome 4 in a cluster of other CXC chemokines. In T lymphocytes, CXCL13 expression is thought to reflect a germinal center origin of the T cell, particularly a subset of T cells called follicular B helper T cells (or TFH cells). Hence, expression of CXCL13 in T-cell lymphomas, such as Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma, is thought to reflect a germinal center origin of the neoplastic T-cells.

The action centers in a sanitarium Arbuckle's character was involuntarily brought to by his wife to be operated on by Keaton's character for alcoholism. Plot A drunken Arbuckle walks the streets on a depressing, rainy night, too drunk to realize that he is being soaked by the rain. He is repeatedly denied entry to a drug store due to his drunken state and is forced to remain in the rain. He befriends a fellow drunk who he attempts to mail home by writing his address on his shirt, covering his face in stamps and placing him on top of a mailbox. He befriends a pair of street performers who play the National Anthem for him despite the pouring rain and as a reward he invites them to take shelter in his home from the rain. As Arbuckle parties in the living room with his newfound friends, his wife is awakened by the couple's pet monkey. Angered, his wife throws the street performers out and announces that she is sick of Arbuckle's drunken behavior. Reading about an operation rumored to cure alcoholism, she orders Arbuckle to undergo the operation or be thrown out of the house. The hospital is revealed to be a sanitarium. Arbuckle is horrified when the doctor due to perform his operation (Keaton) emerges with his apron stained with blood. Arbuckle and a female patient (Alice Lake) attempt to escape, but are quickly apprehended. Doctors tell Arbuckle not to go near the girl again, claiming she is crazy. Arbuckle is taken to the operating room 13. As the doctors prepare for surgery, and after Arbuckle's attempt at postponing the surgery by slipping a clock into his shirt to make the doctors think he has an irregular heartbeat fails, Arbuckle is given anesthetic and falls unconscious. Arbuckle awakes some time later and decides to escape from the sanitarium and bumps into the female patient from his earlier escape attempt. She tries to convince Arbuckle she is not crazy and that she has been mistakenly committed. They are pursued by doctors into the communal patients ward and a mass pillow fight breaks out between the inmates and the guards, allowing Arbuckle and the girl to escape. Once in the clear, Arbuckle asks the girl if there is anything else he can do for her. She asks him to help her get back into the sanitarium. Realizing the girl is genuinely crazy, Arbuckle ditches her by jumping into a nearby pond and pretending to drown, forcing the girl to go running for help. Doctors give chase and while attempting to flee, Arbuckle finds himself back at the sanitarium. Again he attempts to escape, this time by disguising himself as a nurse. With freedom in sight, Arbuckle runs into Keaton, who believes Arbuckle to be an actual woman and begins to flirt with him. Arbuckle goes along with it so as not to blow his cover. The nurse whose uniform Arbuckle is wearing soon arrives, blowing his cover. Arbuckle makes a break for it, pursued by Keaton across a farm and onto a track where a sponsored race is taking place. Arbuckle manages to beat the other runners to the finish line and is declared the winner. He is awarded the prize money, which he realizes he can use to buy alcohol, but the doctors track him down once again. Arbuckle attempts to run off one last time, but is wrestled to the ground by the doctors. The scene suddenly shifts back to the hospital bed with the doctors shaking Arbuckle awake after his operation, revealing the whole escape attempt to have been nothing more than a dream.

He also served on Rent Tribunals under the Rent of Furnished Houses Control (Scotland) Act 1943, determining the fair rent for private tenancies. Election to Parliament At the 1945, Forman was elected as a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament for Glasgow Springburn. After he had taken the oath, it was noticed that his position on the Rent Tribunals was remunerated and that he therefore might hold an 'office of profit under the Crown' which would disqualify him from election. A Select Committee was set up HC Deb 17 August 1945 vol 413 cc272-3 which reported that his election was invalid; a Bill The Coatbridge and Springburn Elections (Validation) Bill was rushed through validating it and indemnifying him from the consequences of acting as an MP while disqualified.The Coatbridge and Springburn Elections (Validation) Act 1945, (9 & 10 George 6.) 3.

He was a member of the Parliamentary Temperance Group and in 1957 supported restrictions on access to clubs selling alcohol for children. Later career After the 1959 general election, Forman's attendance declined. He was one of the Members of Parliament mentioned on BBC Television's \\"That Was The Week That Was\\" on 19 January 1963 as having made no speeches in Parliament since the general election. He retired at the 1964 general election. References M. Stenton and S.

It was a small logging town born in 1916, with 200+ men women and children living there in its prime. Like other New Zealand bush towns, Port Craig was inhabited by hardy kiwi bushmen and their families, recent immigrants and a few others trying to keep clear of the law. The Marlborough Timber Company had a large scale plan to log one of the countries last significant coastal forests. The company planned big, they built the Dominion's largest sawmill, an extensive tramway system, port facilities and township all without road access. The bush was worked by the Lidgerwood overhead logging cable system (gantry) that weighed over 50 tonnes. The immense size of the gantry meant that it was very difficult to relocate in the inhospitable forest and after one major shift, the gantry was left redundant, crippling the local logging industry. Remains of wharf All that is left of the town is considerable relics including the gantry base, a large English built wince (built in Hull) that operated on the wharf and thousands of bricks. There is also a fairly complete bakers oven and the original school building that is now used as a trampers hut. History = Whaling = Mussel Beach had the remains of a whaling station and a 6-oared whaling boat in 1877. = Tracks = The track from Bluecliffs via Mussel Beach to Puysegur was improved when a phone line was erected in 1908, the first base camp being at Mussel Beach. Cages were installed to cross the major rivers. It was further improved in 1919 and 1920 to a horse track from Bluecliffs to Port Craig. = Logging = rimu, brought along the 14km tramwayalt= The logging days commenced in 1917 and continued till about 1929, when it shut down in the face of the looming depression.  Tramway  Work started on the 3 ft 6 in (NZR gauge) Port Craig tramway in 1917. It ran south from Port Craig, parallel to the coast, for to Wairaurahiri River, with a further of branches. It extended over a mile from the mill by 1921 and was extended in 1924. The line was worked by steam locomotives from 1919, including the largest bush locomotive built by A & G Price, a Meyer type Ar 0-4-4-0T, which was on the line from 1926 to 1931. The rails were removed in 1939. Nature The area is remote from any big towns or districts, and this led Port Craig to keep surrounding natural environment at its beauty. Southern right whales and Hector's dolphins sometimes can be seen cavorting close to shores. As early as 1896 it was observed that ferrets seemed to have exterminated wekas and kakapo as far west as the Waitutu River.  Walking Tracks  Parts of the tramway were cleared in 2009 to form a route for the Hump Ridge and South Coast Tracks and the school became a hut.

Meng Huo You () is the name given to petroleum in ancient China, which practiced the use of petroleum as an incendiary weapon in warfare. Historical records of petroleum During the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Chinese historian and poet Ban Gu recorded in the geography section of his Book of Han that a flammable liquid substance are found in the Gao Nu County, located in the northeast portion of present-day Shaanxi Province. This \\"flammable liquid\\" was likely petroleum that had seeped through the ground and was floating above the local waters. Four hundred years later, during the late stages of Southern and Northern Dynasties, historian Fan Ye cited in the Book of Later Han that the collection and exploitation of petroleum had been around for some time: This \\"rock paint\\" is likely petroleum. There are similar records from the Jin and Northern Wei dynasties as well. The earliest mention of \\"rock oil\\" (Áü≥Ê≤π), the Chinese name for petroleum, is by a book \\"Grand Peace Records\\" from the Northern Song Dynasty, and officially designated the current name by Song Dynasty polymath scientist Shen Kuo using the description found in his famous book Dream Pool Essays. Due to the chemical characteristics of petroleum that it continues to burn in water, it was widely used by feudal militaries. Some examples include the defense of the city of Jiuquan in Gansu Province in the year 578 against the invading G√∂kt√ºrk army, in which the defenders used petroleum to ignite and destroy the siege engines brought in by the invaders. Practice and proliferation of Meng Huo You In ancient China, the use of petroleum in warfare was the most effective during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and the following four major dynasties and powers from Song through to Yuan, including the Jin Dynasty and Liao Dynasty. During this time a small dynasty in Vietnam paid tribute to the Chinese emperor with petroleum. Before this time, fire attacks were limited to burning wood or animal fat; using petroleum greatly increased the potency of fire attacks, and the fact that trying to douse the burning petroleum with water will only spread the fire more rapidly made burning oil an ideal weapon for destroying cities filled with wooden structures. Meng Huo You is in many ways similar to the use of Greek fire. The devices used for the Chinese weapons had propelling systems as well. One of the key differences between the two weapons is the use of gunpowder as the ignition in the Chinese design. Decline The Chinese continued to use the oil as a way of repelling nomadic invaders from the northwest. However, by the Ming and Qing dynasties, the newly mature technology of gunpowder had for the most part replaced the use of these short- range flamethrowers, which saw little mention in the historical records of the last dynasties of imperial China.

She was named Dean of the Graduate College at the University of Illinois Medical Center in 1972 and served until 1979. She was named provost at Ohio State University in 1979 and stayed for three years. =California State University (1982‚Äì1990)= In 1982 Reynolds was designated chancellor of the California State University system, replacing Glenn S. Dumke, who had held the job for twenty years, most of the life of the CSU system. During the late 1980s when the CSU system was contemplating a facility in the northern part of San Diego County, she was insistent that it be a full fledged university, California State University San Marcos (CSUSM), rather than a satellite campus of San Diego State University. It was the nation's first new state university in more than 20 years. Although her term was generally successful, she was forced to resign in 1990 when the system trustees questioned the substantial pay raises she had given herself, other top executives, and campus presidents. In addition, several trustees were displeased with a rule that she had put in place shortly before being forced to resign that required campus presidents who were 65 years of age or older to retire. Among those campus presidents forced to retire before this rule was rescinded were Jewel Plummer Cobb at California State University, Fullerton and Ellis E. McCune at Cal State Hayward (now California State University, East Bay). Ironically, the CSU Board of Trustees appointed McCune interim Chancellor while a search for Reynold's replacement was conducted. =City University of New York (1990‚Äì1997)= When Reynolds became the chancellor of the City University of New York (CUNY) in 1990, the system's open enrollment policy had been the subject of debate for two decades. Reynolds defended open enrollment, and also worked to develop stronger college preparatory courses before students entered CUNY ‚Äì which resulted in applicants with stronger academic records. Reynold's effort to introduce academic coordination among campuses and reduce duplicated programs was less successful, and provoked resistance from faculty and administrators. She angered mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani by attempting to relieve students on welfare from workfare requirements. She removed Leonard Jeffries as chairman of the black studies department at City College after he made anti-Semitic comments. In 1994 critics charged she spent too much time serving on the boards of five companies; Reynolds replied corporate contacts strengthened CUNY. According to The New York Times, when she left CUNY in 1997, she had a reputation as a \\"hard-charging, sometimes tyrannical administrator who can be utterly charming but also short-tempered and brusque.\\" =University of Alabama at Birmingham (1997‚Äì2003)= In 1997 Reynolds was named president of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where she established successful capital campaigns and new programs in arts, math and science to develop local teens into college- bound students. She continued to serve on several corporate boards, resulting in frequent absences from the university, a practice different from her predecessors and successors. In 2003, Reynolds claimed she was forced out of the presidency because of gender and age, and filed a federal discrimination complaint. She charged that system chancellor Thomas C. Meredith treated her \\"in a demeaning and sexist manner,\\" including having her stand in line in the rain to buy theater tickets for him, restricting her contact with board members, and after firing her in 2002, offering her a retirement package less than those offered to other outgoing presidents.\\"W.

Previously this genus was placed within the family Trochidae. Calliostoma is the type genus of the family Calliostomatidae. The name of this genus is derived from the Greek words kallos (beautiful) and stoma (mouth), referring to the pearly aperture of the shell. The genus Calliostoma is known in fossil records from the Upper Cretaceous onwards.Shimer & Shrock (1944). Index fossils of North America. The distribution of this genus is worldwide, found mainly on hard substrates, although Japanese species have been found on sandy bottoms. These snails occur from shallow waters to bathyal depths. The species in this genus are mainly herbivorous or feed on detritus,Clench W. & Turner R. (1960). \\"The genus Calliostoma in the western Atlantic\\". Johnsonia 4(40) :1-80. although a few have been observed to be omnivorous (Keen, 1975) or even carnivorous, feeding on a wide range of algae and on animals belonging to various other invertebrate phyla. The North Atlantic topshell Calliostoma occidentale has been reported to feed on coelenterates. Contrary to what is the case in most other top shells, Calliostoma deposits its eggs in gelatinous ribbons that are only fertilized after being deposited. The young emerge as small snails (Lebour, 1936) without passing through a free-living planktonic stage as a veliger larva. Description The rather thin, acute, coeloconoid (=approaching conical shape but with concave sides) shell is imperforate or rarely umbilicate. The whorls are smooth, often polished and spirally ridged or granular. The body whorl is angulated at the periphery. The aperture is quadrangular, sinuated at the base and slightly oblique. The columella is simple, usually ending anteriorly in a slight tooth.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia The nucleus appears to be either dextral or sinistral indifferently.Dall W.

Print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi. is the stage makeup worn by kabuki actors, mostly when performing kabuki plays in the aragoto style. The term also applies to a painting method in which two brushes are used simultaneously, one for the color and the other used to create shading or other details. Kumadori makeup generally consists of brightly coloured stripes or patterns over a white foundation, the colours and patterns symbolising aspects of the character. Though kumadori was originated and developed extensively by members of the Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç family of actors, some conventions are creations of the Onoe Kikugor≈ç line.  Colours  Only a few colours are used in kumadori makeup; red, blue, brown and black. Whilst black is simply used to exaggerate features, such as eyebrows and the line of the mouth, the other colours are used to tell the audience about the character's nature. Red kumadori indicates a powerful hero role, often a character with virtue and courage. The most famous role to use red kumadori is that of the hero in Shibaraku, Kamakura Gongoro, and has come to stereotypically represent kabuki in the West. Blue makeup is used to represent a villain, human or not, and represents negative emotions such as fear and jealousy. Ghosts in traditional Japanese dramas are often trapped by their attachment to such emotions, and so often wear blue makeup; kitsune (fox spirits) such as Genkur≈ç in Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura wear blue makeup as well. Brown represents monsters and non-human spirits, such as oni (demons). One example of the usage of brown kumadori is the tsuchigumo (ground spider) fought by Minamoto no Raik≈ç in Tsuchigumo Soushi.  Patterns  Though only four colours are used, there are over 50 different patterns of kumadori. Kumadori is worn symmetrically on both sides. Some patterns are used for a number of roles, as they have come to represent a specific type of character over time, regardless of the play being performed: \\\\- this style of kumadori features two red lines leading up into the hairline, one leading off the eyebrows and one leading off the eyeline. This pattern is used to express quiet strength in heroes. \\\\- the most well-known pattern of red kumadori, as seen in Shibaraku on the hero Kamakura Gongoro. Its dramatic red lines represent the power and righteous anger of the character. \\\\- a stylish form of red kumadori used for young, handsome and virtuous heroes. The character of Sukeroku in Sukeroku Yukari no Edo Zakura wears mukimi kuma kumadori, and is the epitome of a handsome kabuki hero attempting to win the love of a high- ranking courtesan. \\\\- the style of kumadori used for comic villains; though the kumadori is red, the lines used make the character look like an animal, indicating that they should not be taken seriously. Some forms of zare-guma make the character look like a monkey, or a crab. \\\\- a dramatic form of blue kumadori used to indicate a villainous imperial court artistocrat looking to overthrow those in power. The design used is very similar to that of sugi- guma. An impression of a kabuki actor's face make-up, preserved on a piece of cloth, is known as an oshiguma.

The Moyal Bracket was developed in about 1940 by Jos√© Enrique Moyal, but Moyal only succeeded in publishing his work in 1949 after a lengthy dispute with Paul Dirac. In the meantime this idea was independently introduced in 1946 by Hip Groenewold. Overview The Moyal bracket is a way of describing the commutator of observables in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics when these observables are described as functions on phase space. It relies on schemes for identifying functions on phase space with quantum observables, the most famous of these schemes being the Wigner‚ÄìWeyl transform. It underlies Moyal‚Äôs dynamical equation, an equivalent formulation of Heisenberg‚Äôs quantum equation of motion, thereby providing the quantum generalization of Hamilton‚Äôs equations. Mathematically, it is a deformation of the phase-space Poisson bracket (essentially an extension of it), the deformation parameter being the reduced Planck constant . Thus, its group contraction yields the Poisson bracket Lie algebra. Up to formal equivalence, the Moyal Bracket is the unique one-parameter Lie- algebraic deformation of the Poisson bracket. Its algebraic isomorphism to the algebra of commutators bypasses the negative result of the Groenewold-van Hove theorem, which precludes such an isomorphism for the Poisson bracket, a question implicitly raised by Dirac in his 1926 doctoral thesis: the \\"method of classical analogy\\" for quantization.P.A.M. Dirac, \\"The Principles of Quantum Mechanics\\" (Clarendon Press Oxford, 1958) For instance, in a two- dimensional flat phase space, and for the Weyl-map correspondence, the Moyal bracket reads, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{f,g\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\} & \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}(f\\\\star g-g\\\\star f) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\\\\\{f,g\\\\\\\\} + O(\\\\hbar^2), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where ‚òÖ is the star-product operator in phase space (cf. Moyal product), while and are differentiable phase-space functions, and is their Poisson bracket.Conversely, the Poisson bracket is formally expressible in terms of the star product, = 2. More specifically, this equals {{Equation box 1 indent =: equation = \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{f,g\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}\\\\ = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\hbar} ~ f(x,p)\\\\ \\\\sin \\\\left ( {{\\\\tfrac{\\\\hbar }{2}}(\\\\overleftarrow{\\\\partial }_x \\\\overrightarrow{\\\\partial }_{p}-\\\\overleftarrow{\\\\partial }_{p}\\\\overrightarrow{\\\\partial }_{x})} \\\\right ) \\\\ g(x,p). cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F9FFF7}} The left & right arrows over the partial derivatives denote the left & right partial derivatives. Sometimes the Moyal bracket is referred to as the Sine bracket. A popular (Fourier) integral representation for it, introduced by George BakerG. Baker, \\"Formulation of Quantum Mechanics Based on the Quasi-probability Distribution Induced on Phase Space,\\" Physical Review, 109 (1958) pp.2198-2206\\\\. is :\\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{ f,g \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\}(x,p) = {2 \\\\over \\\\hbar^3 \\\\pi^2 } \\\\int dp' \\\\, dp \\\\, dx' \\\\, dx f(x+x',p+p') g(x+x,p+p)\\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\tfrac{2}{\\\\hbar} (x'p-xp')\\\\right)~. Each correspondence map from phase space to Hilbert space induces a characteristic \\"Moyal\\" bracket (such as the one illustrated here for the Weyl map). All such Moyal brackets are formally equivalent among themselves, in accordance with a systematic theory.C.Zachos, D. Fairlie, and T. Curtright, \\"Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space\\" (World Scientific, Singapore, 2005) . The Moyal bracket specifies the eponymous infinite-dimensional Lie algebrait is antisymmetric in its arguments and , and satisfies the Jacobi identity. The corresponding abstract Lie algebra is realized by ‚òÖ, so that : [ T_f ~, T_g ] = T_{i\\\\hbar \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{ f,g \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} }. On a 2-torus phase space, , with periodic coordinates and , each in , and integer mode indices , for basis functions , this Lie algebra reads, : [ T_{m_1,m_2} ~ , T_{n_1,n_2} ] = 2i \\\\sin \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\hbar}{2}(n_1 m_2 - n_2 m_1 )\\\\right ) ~ T_{m_1+n_1,m_2+ n_2}, ~ which reduces to SU(N) for integer . SU(N) then emerges as a deformation of SU(‚àû), with deformation parameter 1/N. Generalization of the Moyal bracket for quantum systems with second-class constraints involves an operation on equivalence classes of functions in phase space,M. I. Krivoruchenko, A. A. Raduta, Amand Faessler, Quantum deformation of the Dirac bracket, Phys. Rev. D73 (2006) 025008. which can be considered as a quantum deformation of the Dirac bracket. Sine bracket and cosine bracket Next to the sine bracket discussed, Groenewold further introduced the cosine bracket, elaborated by Baker,See also the citation of Baker (1958) in: arXiv:hep- th/9711183v3 : \\\\begin{align} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{f ,g\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} & \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(f\\\\star g+g\\\\star f) = f g + O(\\\\hbar^2). \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Here, again, ‚òÖ is the star-product operator in phase space, and are differentiable phase-space functions, and is the ordinary product. The sine and cosine brackets are, respectively, the results of antisymmetrizing and symmetrizing the star product. Thus, as the sine bracket is the Wigner map of the commutator, the cosine bracket is the Wigner image of the anticommutator in standard quantum mechanics. Similarly, as the Moyal bracket equals the Poisson bracket up to higher orders of , the cosine bracket equals the ordinary product up to higher orders of . In the classical limit, the Moyal bracket helps reduction to the Liouville equation (formulated in terms of the Poisson bracket), as the cosine bracket leads to the classical Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation.B.

Geography and administrative division  Geographically the area was centered on the city of Vilnius, which had always been the capital of the entity and the seat of a voivode. However, the actual territory of the voivodeship varied over time. Together with the Trakai Voivodeship it was known as Lithuania propria. Until the partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth the voivodeship was composed of five smaller units of administrative division named powiat (in Lithuanian: plural - pavietai, singular - pavietas), similar to British counties: * Powiat of Vilnius-Trakai * Powiat of A≈°miany * Powiat of Lida * Powiat of Vilkmergƒó * Powiat of Bras≈Ça≈≠ History In 1413 the Union of Horod≈Ço introduced the title of voivode to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Before the reform, the area, centered on Vilnius, was known as the Duchy of Lithuania or sometimes as the Duchy of Vilnius. Vilnius Voivodeship became the capital voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the Union of Lublin in 1569 which formed the Commonwealth, Grand Duchy retained much of its autonomy, and Vilnius Voivodeship remained its capital voivodeship, just as Vilnius remained its capital city, although the capital of the Commonwealth was first in Cracow (Cracow Voivodeship) and later in Warsaw (Masovian Voivodeship). In 1793, voivodeships of Breslauja and Merkinƒó (Merkinƒó was really part of Vinius, but considered nominally part of Smolensk) were created from northern part of it. Breslauja Voivodeship consisted from Breslauja, Vilkmergƒó and Anyk≈°ƒçiai counties and Merkinƒó one consisted from Merkinƒó, Prienai and Ei≈°i≈°kƒós ones. After the partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, the territory of Vilnius Voivodeship was incorporated into the Russian Empire, most of the territory becoming a part of Vilna Governorate. Northern part of it was passed to Kovno Governorate in 1843. After World War I former Vilnius Voivodeship was divided between Lithuania and Poland.

The first part is called \\"Seder Eliyahu Rabbah\\" (31 chapters); the second, \\"Seder Eliyahu Zu·π≠a\\" (15 chapters).  The two sections: Rabbah and Zutta  This midrash is referred to in the Talmud: Regarding the last line, Rashi explains that \\"Rabbah\\" refers to what was taught before this incident (\\"outside the box\\") and \\"Zutta\\" to what was taught after the incident (\\"inside the box\\"). Anan was a Babylonian amora of the 3rd century. The collection of baraitot concerning him, referred to in this midrash, is cited in the Babylonian Talmud under the title \\"Tanna debei Eliyahu\\" (see below), and the utterances in question are found in the midrash itself. Tosafot say that the midrash consists of a large book and a small one.Tosafot to Ketubot 106a, s.v. ◊ï◊î◊ô◊ô◊†◊ï R. Nathan ben Jehiel says: \\"The midrash contains baraitot which the prophet taught to Anan, and consists of two parts, a large seder with 30 chapters, and a small seder with 12 chapters; and all of the Tanna debe Eliyahu cited in the Talmud is to be found in these baraitot.\\"In his Arukh (s.v. ◊°◊ì◊®, 2) The inner connection between these two midrashim is a loose one, and it is only in sections 5 to 10 that the second refers to the first. Contents = The periods of history = The underlying theme of the Tanna debe Eliyahu, which (with many interruptions) runs through the whole work, is the evolution of the world-system. The midrash calls the single periods of the history of man \\"shittot\\" (series). The first series, which deals with the beginning of the world and extends to the moment when man was driven out of Eden, consists of two subsections, (a) \\"Ma'aseh Merkabah\\" and (b) \\"Ma'aseh Bereshit.\\" The six series of the world-system, however, were created in the divine mind even before any being, with the exception of Israel, existed. They were: # the divine law (◊™◊ï◊®◊î) # hell (◊í◊ô◊î◊†◊ù) # paradise (◊í◊ü ◊¢◊ì◊ü), or punishment and reward in the future world # the Throne of God (◊õ◊°◊ê ◊î◊õ◊ë◊ï◊ì), or the divine government of the world # the name of the Messiah (◊©◊ù ◊î◊û◊©◊ô◊ó), or the restoration of the universe when about to be destroyed # the Temple (◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊î◊û◊ß◊ì◊©), or the dependence of man upon God. Even before these six foundations, however, Israel was, as stated above, already in being in the divine mind, because without Israel there could have been no Torah. The second series embraces the period from the expulsion of man from Eden to the Flood. In the ten generations from Adam to Noah man did not adhere to \\"meekness,\\" did not do what was right, but fell lower and lower until he practiced violence, theft, immorality, and murder. For this reason his destruction became a necessity.Tanna Debei Eliyahu Zuta 10 The third series extends from the Flood to King Manasseh of Judah. It treats of the time of the study of the Law, of the priestly office, of the kingdom, and of the end of Israel's prosperity through the evil administration of Manasseh. In the days of Abraham the period of \\"tohu wa-bohu\\" (confusion) ceases and the 2,000 years of law begin. This time is divided into the following periods: # the sojourn of the children of Israel in Egypt, the Exodus, to Joshua # the kingdom of love extending to Samuel # the kingdom of fear, to the time of Elijah # the kingdom of truth, to the time of Jeroboam II # the time of Israel's salvation from oppression under Hezekiah # from the time of Hezekiah to the reign of Manasseh The fourth series is filled with \\"meekness\\" (ib. p. 163). Whoever studies the Torah receives \\"meekness\\" as a reward. In addition there is a second recompense, which is the Mishnah. In this introduction of the Mishnah there is a trace of apology intended for those who believe that only the Torah was delivered on Mount Sinai. The fifth series extends from King Manasseh to the building of the Second Temple. The last series treats of the future. God, surrounded by all the saints, sits in His beit midrash and counts up the generations of the different periods of time, what they have learned, and what reward they shall receive for it.Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabbah 3 The future of these saints will be like the beginning of the life of man (ib. p. 164). These six series are again divided into three main periods: (1) the present world; (2) the Messianic period; and (3) the future world. These are subdivided into: (a) 2,000 years of confusion (\\"tohu\\"); (b) 2,000 years of the Torah; (c) 2,000 years of the Messiah; (d) inauguration of a general peace; (e) the future world. =Discussion of virtues= Besides this fundamental idea both parts of the midrash emphasize the importance of virtue, of a religious life, and of the study of the Law, and exhort to repentance and almsgiving, greater tolerance toward both Jews and non-Jews, diligent study and respect for scholars, modesty and humility, and the avoidance of non- Jewish manners and customs. The midrash, further, attempts to prove that all human life is based on the two extremes, toil in the sweat of the brow, and the regaining of the freedom of the soul. Hence it begins with the expulsion of Adam from Eden (Gen. ), and closes with the same theme. The cherubim in Eden are identified with man, and are the symbol of the reward of well-doing; the flaming sword is hell, the punishment for evil-doing. The way to the tree of life is said to be \\"derekh eretz\\" (good behavior), while the guarding of the tree of life is like the guarding of the word of God. By derekh eretz the midrash understands that which is fitting, useful, and honest; and these three qualities are the fundamental principles upon which the human world-system and society rest. An example of derekh eretz in this midrash is the following: The Philistine princesI Samuel possessed derekh eretz, because when the Philistines wished to convey the Ark to the Israelites they would not send it back without sacrifices.Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabbah 11 On the other hand, the inhabitants of Beit Shemesh did not possess it, inasmuch as instead of bowing before the Ark they rejoiced and danced before it boldly, so that misfortune came upon them and 50,000 of them fell. The opposite of derekh eretz is \\"to walk in the crooked way,\\" i.e., to do unworthy deeds and to give oneself up to immorality. Yet no nation of the world, with the exception of Ancient Egypt, has sunk so low as this. In ordinary life, however, the transgression of a command or prohibition, indecency, or even theft is a most pronounced opposite of derekh eretz; and every father of a family should strive to preserve those depending on him from these vices, because they belong to those evils which might bring about the destruction of the world. =Theological issues= The twelve chapters of Seder Eliyahu Zutta are characterized by the fact that the narratives showing why in this world things often go amiss with the good and well with the wicked, are commonly introduced by the words \\"It happened\\" (◊û◊¢◊©◊î) or \\"Once on a time\\" (◊§◊¢◊ù ◊ê◊ó◊™). The midrash is sometimes interspersed with very beautiful prayers (see, for example, M. Friedmann, l.c. pp. 6, 18, 19, 28). The Tanna debe Eliyahu is the only aggadic work which contains a rabbinic-karaitic polemic. In chapter 2 of Seder Eliyahu Zutta is an account of a meeting of the author with a Karaite, who possesses a knowledge of Jewish Scripture, but not of the Mishnah; the differences discussed, however, are not important. The polemical attitude is much more noticeable in chapter 15 of the first part. There the following points are treated in detail: *washing the handsCompare ·∏§ul. 106a; Shab. 62b; So·π≠ah 4b *slaughteringCompare Hullin 27a *partaking of human bloodCompare Ker. 20b *prohibition against eating fatCompare Lev. ; Keritut 4b; Pinsker, Likkutei Kadmoniyyot, p. 20 *robbery from a Jew and from a non-JewCompare B. ·∏≤. 113b *degrees of relationship as bearing on marriageCompare Eshkol ha-Kofer, p. 117b *grades of puritycomp. ib. p. 111b; Shabbat 13a Unlike other polemics, this one is not couched in acrimonious terms, but it adopts a mild, conciliatory tone.  Time and place of composition  Scholars agree that the work was composed around the end of the 10th century. However, opinions differ as to where it was written. Whereas certain scholars (e.g., Zunz, J.L. Rapoport, W. Bacher, Oppenheim, and Hochmuth) suppose Babylonia or Palestine, G√ºdemann is of the opinion that the work was written in Italy, or at least that its author must have been an Italian who had traveled a great deal and had been as far as Babylon, who learned there of the polemic between the Rabbinites and Karaites, but who abstained from mentioning Europe or Italy because he considered he would be likely to create a greater impression among his fellow countrymen by relating observations which he had made abroad. Furthermore, the fact that he knew nothing of Babylonia beyond its name shows that he could not have been a native of that region. Derenbourg also places the origin of the work in Rome. H. Gr√§tz goes farthest of all, by simply identifying the Babylon of the midrash with Rome, and the fights of Gog and Magog described in the work with the devastating invasion of the Hungarians into Italy from 889 to 955. The most radical opponent of this view is M. Friedmann. For him all arguments concerning the age of the Tanna debe Eliyahu and against its identification with the \\"Seder Eliyahu\\" mentioned in Ket. 10b, are only superficial and only apparently sound; and he accordingly assigns the origin of the work \\"eo ipso\\" to Babylonia. The age of the midrash can be estimated from three data contained in the book itself. # Chapter 2 speaks of the 7th century of the 2,000 years of the Messianic period as having passed; this period began in 242 CE, hence the time of writing must have been the 10th century. # The second datum relates to the temporal reckoning of the jubilees, and is treated by J.L. Rapoport.In Toledot de-R. Natan, p. 144 # Chapter 30 indicates that nine centuries had passed since the destruction of the Second Temple; hence the last redaction of the midrash falls in the interval between 968 and 984.  Examples of exegesis  The especially original midrashim in the work include the following. * On the passage \\"and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones\\",Ezekiel it is said, \\"Instead of 'bones' [◊¢◊¶◊û◊ï◊™] should be read 'tree of death' [◊¢◊• ◊û◊ï◊™]; for it was the same tree which, through Adam's disobedience, brought death to him and to all his descendants\\". * \\"'And this man went up out of his city yearly':I Samuel from these words it appears that Elkanah went to Shiloh four times a year, three times in accordance with the legal prescription, and once in addition, which last journey he had assumed voluntarily\\".Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabbah 8 * \\"On the day of Adam's death his descendants made a feast, because on account of his age he had long been a burden to himself and to them\\" Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabbah 16 * \\"'I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger':Hoshea God has sworn to His people that He will not give them in exchange for another people, nor change them for another nation\\".Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabbah 24 * \\"'The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God':Psalms a man may not say in his heart, 'This world is tohu va-bohu; I will give myself up to sensual pleasures and will retire from the world'\\"Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabbah 25 * \\"From the words 'Israel was holiness unto the Lord'Jeremiah it follows that the holiness of God, of Shabbat, and of Israel is the same.\\"Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabbah 26 The passages in the Talmud cited under \\"Tanna debei Eliyahu\\" and found in this midrash are: Shabbat 13a; Pesachim 94a, 112a; Megillah 28b; Kiddushin 80b; Avodah Zarah 5b, 9a; Sanhedrin 92a; Tamid 32a. Those cited in the Talmud under \\"Tanu Rabbanan\\" and found also in this midrash are: Shabbat 88b and Gittin 36b = Tanna debei Eliyahu (ed. Friedmann), p. 78; Pesachim 49a = ib. p. 30; Pesachim 49a = ib. p. 61; Sukkah 52a = ib. p. 20; Rosh Hashana 18a = ib. p. 53; Megillah 14a = ib. p. 82; Kiddushin 82a = ib. p. 101; Bava Kamma 97b = ib. p. 21; Bava Batra 90b = ib. p. 77; Bava Batra 147a = ib. p. 157; Sanhedrin 29a = ib. p. 147; Sanhedrin 43b = ib. p. 102; Sanhedrin 109a = ib. p. 158; Shevuot 39a = ib. p. 132; Yevamot 62b = ib. p. 78. Furthermore, in this midrash are found sentences of the following amoraim: Johanan, Joshua ben Levi, R. Abbahu, and Eleazar.  Editions  The first published edition of this midrash appeared at Venice in the year 1598, prepared from a copy dated 1186. In 1677 an edition by Samuel b. Moses Haida, with changes in the text and with a commentary (◊ì◊ê◊©◊ê ◊ñ◊ß◊ï◊ß◊ô◊ü ◊ì◊†◊ï◊®◊ê ◊ë◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊ü), appeared in Prague. The text itself was presented in a \\"nus·∏•a ·∏•adasha\\" (new text) and in a \\"nus·∏•a yeshana\\" (old text), being wholly distorted from its original form by Talmudic and cabalistic interpolations. This edition consists of three parts, the first two of which contain the text of the Rabbah and the Zu·π≠a (31 and 29 chapters respectively). These two parts are preceded by prefaces bearing the titles \\"Mar ·∏≤ashshisha\\" or \\"Sod Malbush ha-Neshamah\\" (Mystery of the Clothing of the Soul) and \\"Mar Yanu·∏≥a\\" or \\"Sod ·∏§alu·∏≥a de-Rabbanan\\" (Mystery of the Clothing of the Rabbis). Then follows an introduction (common to part 2 and part 3), with the title \\"Sha'ar Shemuel\\" (Gate of Samuel), and a third part consisting mainly of an exegesis of chapter 20. The following editions are specially to be recommended, namely: that by Jacob ben Naphtali Herz of Brody, with a commentary, Yeshu'at Ya'a·∏≥ob (Zolkiev, 1798); that by Abraham ben Judah L√∂b Schick, with the commentary Me'ore Esh (Sidlkov, 1835); that by Isaac Elijah ben Samuel Landau, with a commentary, Ma'aneh Eliyahu (Wilna, 1840). Among the best editions is the Warsaw one of 1880 containing both texts. The latest edition (prior to 1906) appeared in Vienna in 1900 and 1903, under the titles Seder Eliyahu Rabbah and Seder Eliyahu Zu·π≠a, after a Vatican manuscript of the year 1073, critically revised, and with a commentary entitled Me'ir 'Ayin, and a voluminous introduction by M. Friedmann. In this edition Seder Eliyahu Zu·π≠a is divided into 15 chapters. An English version was translated by William G.Braude and Israel J.Kapstein in 1981 (cf. recension in Recherches de science religieuse, 1982, p. 553).

The technique provides significant additional image stability, especially when the listener is moving or off-axis. It was developed by Dr Geoffrey Barton, a major figure in the \\"second wave\\" of original Ambisonics development, and Michael Gerzon. It should not to be confused with a Yamaha system with a similar name. Trifield also has applications in conventional surround mixing. There are several problems involved in mixing with an additional centre front channel for many engineers. The channel itself was originally designed for dialogue in matrix cinema surround systems and does not have a direct application in music mixing, where a 2-speaker stereo stage is generally, and traditionally, employed. Many studio engineers with a background in conventional stereo music mixing find that simple panning of a source to the centre-front (CF) channel makes it fail to blend in with the stereo mix. However, if the CF channel is left silent, consumers may believe there is a fault with the disc or with their equipment. A way around this problem is offered by Trifield. The processor typically takes a 2-channel L-R signal and renders it for L-C-R, and no signals are sent to the CF except for those generated by the Trifield processor. Not only does CF content now blend with the mix: in addition, the resulting soundstage is more stable and listener-position independent, while the listener can confirm that something is actually emerging from their centre-front loudspeaker. The Trifield process is included in some surround decoders and is generally praised highly by reviewers, even though they generally don't know what it is. The technique is patented () and can be licensed from Trifield Productions (see External links).

The F10 and F12 were launched in 1977, with many innovative features for its time, most notably a safety cab with high level of ergonomics for the driver. The F16 was launched in 1987 and was more powerful. Volvo manufactured about 200,000 trucks in the series between 1977 and 1993. The basic chassis components and also the driveline components of the trucks, when launched in 1977, were to a large extent based on the ones introduced in 1973 for the Volvo N-series trucks. The numbering on these models tells the engine displacement in litres. Various power outputs were offered, and the engines have gone through several modifications through the years. All engines are straight six-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines of Volvo's own make. The series got two major upgrades during its production. The first one in 1983, which included major changes to the cabin, (larger windscreen and heightened roof) a new chassis with decreased weight and parabolic springs, and the spacious \\"Globetrotter\\" cabin was offered as an option. The engines also got an upgrade, but the power output was unchanged. The second upgrade came in 1987, with the arrival of the powerful F16 and some cosmetic changes. The F16 truck had a new six-cylinder, straight-in-line engine with four valves per cylinder and a high-placed camshaft. It was widely used for hauling large train weights, such as timber trucks in Scandinavia (a market hitherto dominated by Scania AB trucks powered by the Scania V8 engine, and Cummins- powered Sisu trucks in Finland). They were also popular in the road trains of Australia. The F-series was replaced by the Volvo FH-series in 1994.

Gregh was born in Philippeville, now Skikda, Algeria. His family was of Maltese origin. As a composer, he wrote operettas, ballets, numerous popular songs, and over 150 works for piano for two, four, and six hands. He died in Sainte Mesme, Seine- et-Oise, now Yvelines, aged 71.

On the Chiltern Main Line, the snow caused tree branches in the cutting at Seer Green to be weighed down and some of them were brushed by passing trains. On 11 December, the driver of an empty train from Marylebone to Princes Risborough came across a fallen branch lying across the track. He telephoned the signalman at High Wycombe to tell him that he was going to clear the obstruction and would be delayed by a few minutes. Meanwhile, at Gerrards Cross, behind the stationary train, the driver of the 07:31 from Marylebone to Banbury was being cautioned by the signalman about the overhanging branches. The signalman then attempted to clear the starting signal for the train to proceed but the lever was locked. Unaware that the empty train had stopped, he looked at his signal box diagram and thought that the indications showed that the empty train was running towards Beaconsfield. Assuming that the signal lever had frozen (when in fact it was electrically locked by the stationary train), he authorised the driver to pass the signal at danger, and the train set off into the still-falling snow. Glancing again at his diagram, he saw that the lights towards Beaconsfield were not in fact lit, and realised that the empty train was still in the section near Seer Green. He quickly went to the window and tried to attract the driver's attention by shouting, but nobody heard him. The driver of the Banbury train drove too fast for the conditions and ran into the back of the empty train at about 30 mph. The front coach of the Banbury train partly telescoped underneath the rear coach of the empty train, and the driver and three passengers were killed. Five others were also injured. Investigation Marylebone At the public inquiry, Inspecting Officer Major C.F. Rose held the signalman at Gerrards Cross chiefly to blame, although he did note that the signalman had only been qualified for a month and had been appointed through a job centre because nobody could be recruited internally. In addition to his inexperience, the signalling between Gerrards Cross and High Wycombe was unusually complex, with several track circuit block sections and intermediate block sections. The signal box diagram was subsequently altered to make its indications less ambiguous. The driver of the Banbury train also shared some responsibility, because he drove too fast to be able to stop short of the stationary train. Although British Rail's rules stated that the guard of the empty train should have applied detonator protection, this would have been unreasonable given that the obstruction would have been cleared in a few minutes.

Though many variations exist, common features of Chinese chicken salads include lettuce, cabbage, chicken (typically breast meat), deep-fried wonton skins or rice vermicelli and nuts (sliced almonds, cashews or peanuts). A basic vinaigrette for the salad includes ingredients like vegetable oil, sesame oil, rice vinegar (or citrus juice). Optional seasonings include dry hot mustard, sesame seeds, coriander and raw ginger or pickled ginger. In restaurants, Chinese chicken salad may be more embellished and offered as an American-style entree salad, similar to Caesar, Chef, and Cobb salads. History The Chinese chicken salad that is popular in the US seems to be a product of pan- Asian cuisine or fusion cuisine influences, rather than having roots in Chinese cuisine. Reasoning for that theory is that green lettuce salad is a dish of primarily Western origins.Martin Yan (2000) Chinese Cooking for Dummies, John Wiley and Sons Many non-Western world cultures also have salads of various sorts as part of their traditional cuisines. In Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads, Sylvia Lovegren writes, \\"There are many different types of cold chicken salad in China, although most of them seem to originate in Szechwan. But the Chinese chicken salad being consumed ... by the fashionable set, probably originated in California.\\"Sylvia Lovegren (2005) Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads, University of Chicago Press In Hollywood Dish, Akasha Richmond writes, \\"Hollywood gave rise to more salads than just the Caesar and Cobb. The 1960s produced the Chinese Chicken Salad, which was made popular at Madame Wu's in Santa Monica. Cary Grant asked her to put it on the menu after eating it at another restaurant.\\"Akasha Richmond (2006) Hollywood Dish: More Than 150 Delicious, Healthy Recipes from Hollywood's Chef to the Stars, Penguin According to a website about Sylvia Cheng Wu, who is popularly known by her alias Madame Wu, \\"She came up with something better, using a recipe she vaguely remembered having encountered in Shanghai. It was a blend of shredded chicken, fried vermicelli, green onions and toasted almonds. Madame Wu‚Äôs soon became known for her Chinese chicken salad, now an American luncheon classic.\\" But, the popularity of Chinese Chicken salad was not necessarily mainstream yet, although perhaps intimated and attempted throughout the years and generations. In the United States, many common cookbooks from circa 1900 to the 1950s would include chicken salad; but, for many of them, that would often presume a bound salad with chopped vegetables and mayonnaise, typically without lettuce. For example, The Settlement Cookbook by Mrs. Simon Kander, published as early as 1910, includes a simple \\"Lettuce salad\\" with chopped onion and French or German dressing; but, no Chinese, Asian or Oriental salad of any kind.Mrs. Simon Kander, The Settlement Cookbook, The American Crayon Company, New York, N.Y., 1910, fourth edition, pg. 195, 206-207. Similar bound chicken salads were found in Joy of Cooking as of the 1974 editions (first published as of 1931).Irma s Rombauer and Marion Rombauer Becker, Joy of Cooking, Signet/The New American Library, Inc., 1974; original copyright 1931, The Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. It was by 1950s that main course type salads started to appear in books like Better Homes & Gardens, New Cook Book; whereas, that often included Caesar salad along with the usual bound chicken salad, but no Asian-styled or -flavored salads.Better Homes & Gardens', New Cook Book, Meredith Publishing Company, 1953, 1962, 1965, Ninth Edition. The Good Housekeeping Cookbook introduced a \\"Sesame-Spinach Salad,\\" with soy sauce and salad oil, although not with sesame oil; whereas, this introduced something closer to Asian flavors, such as comparatively to what also included a few curry salads and still others that were similar to Better Homes.Zoe Coulson, Eds., The Good Housekeeping Cookbook, The Hearst Corporation, New York, New York, 1973, The next generation of ever more exotic and main course salads were on the way. With intimations of Asian-style lettuce salads appearing by the 1950s and into the 1970s, publishers like California's Sunset Magazine stated in their popular cookbooks and guides that \\"You'll find such classics as Caesar, Waldorf, and Crab Louis; international favorites with exotic names like Tabbuli and Antipasto; satisfying whole-meal salads like Shrimp-stuffed Avocados and Taco Salad...\\" Judith A Gaulke and Linda Brandt, Eds., Sunset Favorite Recipes for Salads, Sunset Books/Lane Publishing Co., Menlo Park, CA, 1979, 1966, 1962, 1937 copyright, Fourth printing 1982, page 2. and so on. Suddenly, sesame seeds went from just being a garnish on a salad, to being an ingredient for a recipe of \\"Sesame Seed Dressing\\" (p. 6); but, more over, and indeed, there was now a recipe for \\"Chinese Chicken Salad\\" (p. 35). Sunset's recipe for Chinese Chicken appeared similarly as to what it's known as today, including: soy sauce; salad oil; garlic and ginger; (relatively exotic) Chinese five-spice or (more common substitute, ground cinnamon); broiler fryer chicken (marinated in sherry wine); sesame seed; shredded iceberg lettuce; green onions; coriander (cilantro); cashews or peanuts; and lemon dressing.Judith A Gaulke and Linda Brandt, Eds., Sunset Favorite Recipes for Salads (p.35) (Note: recipe \\"Best- Ever Chinese Chicken Salad (Sunset, May 2006) is not the same as appears in book. See separate citation.) It was noted therein, that \\"Many variations of this salad vie for popularity. This one, without traditional crisp noodles, is simpler than most...\\" since, fried vermicelli noodles is probably difficult to find and make for many homemakers. Most of these recipes had not yet included sesame oil, seemingly still rare to find for most homemakers. Beyond that, perhaps reflecting the California lifestyle and its eventual approach to the newer California Cuisine that used fresh ingredients and contemporary, multicultural flare, Sunset also now provided countless other Asian salad recipes, seeming to recognize the new trend and desire: Oriental Cabbage Slaw (p. 24); Oriental Wilted Romaine Salad (p. 25); Chicken in Cantaloupe with Curry Dressing (no lettuce) (p. 33); Hoisin Chicken Salad (p. 36); Oriental Turkey Salad (p. 37); and so on.Judith A Gaulke and Linda Brandt, Eds., Sunset Favorite Recipes for Salads The new Chinese and other Asian salads were added with a broad arrangement of other main salads, although perhaps not authentic, they were nevertheless styled and inspired by exotic cuisines and ingredients. Sunset's salad book and recipes seemed to appeal to Americans's desire for greater variety and international fares. The continued popularity of Chinese chicken salad has established its regular feature on many restaurant menus, including from the fast food establishment Wendy's \\"Asian Cashew Chicken Salad\\" to the upscale \\"Chinois Chicken Salad\\" by Wolfgang Puck; of which, this later figure is indeed one of the few pioneers of California Cuisine. Today's Chinese chicken salad has been developed, but found its contributions from various restaurants, cookbooks and online recipes. As a quick and easy homestyle salad this salad may contain a combination of water chestnuts and mandarin orange slices; as well as use of store-bought instant ramen noodles and a seasoning packet that is used to flavor a vinaigrette dressing. All of these recipes provide variations of the salad's style and theme; all of them representing interpretations from various contributors. While Chinese chicken salad, and its variations, have also been known as \\"Asian Chicken Salad\\" and \\"Oriental Chicken Salad\\"; more over, it has as well (sometimes) seen the removal of chicken from the dish and its name (if not adding or substituting other ingredients, like seafood).

Thomas, Chapter VIII: Glasgow It linked the Pollok and Govan Railway with the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway, the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway, the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway and the Clydesdale Junction Railway. On 24 July 1854 parts of the line were vested with the Caledonian Railway; and final amalgamation occurred on 29 June 1865. In the 1921 Railway Grouping it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The route From its terminus at the River Clyde, the General Terminus and Glasgow Harbour Railway proceeded to Scotland Street Junction, where one branch crossed under the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway to join the City Union Line at Port Eglinton Junction. The other branch crossed under both the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway and the Paisley Canal Line; before splitting at Terminus Junction. One branch joined the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway and the Cathcart District Railway at Muirhouse Central Junction, the other branch passed through one of the Eglinton Street Tunnels and joined the Polloc and Govan Railway. Expansion under British Railways In 1954, as part of their development of their Ravenscraig steelworks, near Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Colvilles Ltd and British Railways began installing new wharfage and facilities at General Terminus Quay.Campbell, R.H. Iron and Steel. Chapter 5 in: Cunnison and Gilfillan This was to allow the simultaneously unloading of two large ships carrying bulk iron ore. The ships were designed to hold 12,000 tons (12,200 metric tonnes) of iron ore.Sleeman. The Present System: The Port of Glasgow To-day. In Chapter 10 of: Cunnison & Gilfillan Iron ore was to be transported, in bulk, by railway, from the River Clyde to the Lanarkshire steel works at, Motherwell. In March 1949, forward plans by Colvilles suggested that the General Terminus Quay ore handling facility would be handling two million tons of basic iron ore per year. 1,020,000 tons per year for the Clyde Iron Works and 980,000 tons for Ravenscraig steelworks.Payne (1979), page 309. In 1954, Scotland imported 1,436,000 tons (1,460,000 metric tonnes) of iron ore, mainly from Sweden, North Africa, and Newfoundland. Run down and redevelopment The opening of the deep water Hunterston Ore Terminal, near West Kilbride, in the early 1970s led to The General Terminus Quay ceasing to handle this traffic and the ore handling equipment was demolished in the early 1980s. A large area of the river frontage, including part of Windmillcroft Quay, Springfield Quay, General Terminus Quay, Mavisbank Quay and Princes Dock, was cleared in the early 1980s. Mavisbank Quay and the mostly infilled Princes Dock area was used to host the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival. The former Glasgow Garden Festival site was relatively quickly redeveloped after the end of the six month festival; however the General Terminus Quay site was left vacant. It has since been used for housing and nearly all traces of the railway line have been removed between the River Clyde and its passage under the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway.

Found in North America and the Dominican Republic, mushrooms grow on the ground under pine trees. Fruit bodies have reddish-brown, shiny caps up to wide atop tapered stems up to long. The gills are thick, initially pale orange before turning blackish, and extend a short way down the length of the stem. Although the mushroom is edible, and sold in local markets in Mexico, it is not highly rated. Distinguishing this species from some other similar Chroogomphus species is difficult, as their morphology is similar, and cap coloration is too variable to be a reliable characteristic. C. vinicolor is differentiated from the European C. rutilus and the North American C. ochraceus by the thickness of its cystidial walls. Taxonomy The species was first described as Gomphidius vinicolor in 1898 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, based on specimens collected near Lake Mohonk in Ulster County, New York. Peck noted a resemblance to Gomphidius roseus, which he thought was closely related. It was transferred to the newly created genus Chroogomphus by Orson K. Miller, Jr. in 1964. Molecular analysis of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences shows that C. vinicolor groups in a clade with the closely related C. jamaicensis and C. pseudovinicolor. All of these species feature darkly- amyloid flesh and thick-walled cystidia. Based on this analysis, Miller considered C. jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C. vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species; however, as of 2012, both MycoBank and Index Fungorum list it as a valid species. The specific epithet vinicolor means \\"wine-colored\\". It is commonly known as the \\"wine-cap Chroogomphus\\" or the \\"pine spike\\". Description The fruit body of C. vinicolor has caps that are initially conical to convex before later flattening out, sometimes developing a small umbo, or a central depression; the caps measure wide. Its color is highly variable, ranging from wine-red to reddish-brown to orange-brown or yellow-brown. Wine-red stains develop where the surface has dried or become rotten. The smooth cap surface is shiny, somewhat sticky when wet, and often radially streaked. The flesh is thick and orangish to ochraceous in color; its taste and odor have been variously described as \\"not distinctive\\" or \\"pleasant\\". The thick gills are decurrent (attached to and extending a short ways down the stem), well spaced, ochraceous buff to pale orange when young, but turning to blackish after the spores mature. In his original description, Peck noted that the gills, when viewed with a hand lens, \\"appear velvety due to the abundant spores\\". The fruit bodies are initially covered with a thin, web-like partial veil that soon disappears as the cap expands. The cylindrical stem measures long by thick, and taper towards the base. It is ochraceous to wine red or reddish- brown with a dry, smooth to fibrillose surface. The partial veil sometimes leaves an indistinct, thin fibrous ring on the upper stem. The spore print is greyish-black. Spores are narrowly elliptical to spindle-shaped, smooth, and measure 17‚Äì23 by 4.5‚Äì7.5 Œºm. The cystidia are somewhat spindle-shaped or narrowly club-shaped, and measure 112‚Äì164 by 13‚Äì20 ¬µm. They have characteristically thick walls, up to 7.5 ¬µm wide in the middle portion. Although the mushroom is edible, and is often free of insect damage, it is not highly recommended, \\"except as \\"fillers\\" to include with the more flavorful species\\". The flavor may improve with drying. C. vinicolor mushrooms are sold in local markets at Tetela del Volcan in the state of Morelos, Mexico. There is a report of this species causing a contact sensitivity, in which an individual who had handled the mushroom developed a burning sensation in the eyes and an itchy rash on the eyelid after rubbing the eyes. =Similar species= Chroogomphus pseudovinicolor is larger, and has a thick wooly or scaly stem. Two other Chroogomphus species with a morphology and coloration similar to C. vinicolor include C. rutilus and C. ochraceous. C. vinicolor is most reliably distinguished from these on the basis of having thick-walled cystidia (up to 5‚Äì7.5 Œºm at the widest part). The other two species have been separated on the basis of color, with C. ochraceous having brighter colors (yellowish-orange to ochraceous) than C. rutilus. Molecular analyses of European and North American collections suggest that C. rutilus is restricted to Europe, C. ochraceous only occurs in North America, and that cap coloration cannot be reliably used for species determination. Another nearly identical species is C. jamaicensis, found in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the Greater Antilles. It is distinguished microscopically by its slightly smaller spores measuring 17‚Äì20 by 4.5‚Äì6 Œºm, cystidia with more uniformly thickened walls up to 5 Œºm thick, and cuticular hyphae that measure 2‚Äì5 Œºm wide. The fruit bodies of C. pseudovinicolor are more robust, with wooly or scaly reddish stems up to thick. Further, this species tends to produce spore prints that are greener than those of C. vinicolor. Habitat and distribution The mycorrhizal fungus sometimes fruits singly, but more often in scattered or groups on the ground under pines and other conifers. Fruiting usually occurs in the cooler weather of later summer and autumn. In coastal California, however, fruiting occurs in winter. It is often found near Suillus luteus and Suillus brevipes, and is known to parasitize the mycelium of both those and the truffle-like Rhizopogon species. Chroogomphus vinicolor has a widespread range in North America, extending south to Mexico. It has also been recorded from the Dominican Republic.

This is the third game in the series set in a 3D world, following Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon and Ganbare Goemon: Kuru Nara Koi! Ayashige Ikka no Kuroi Kage. Unlike most of the other games, this game departs from the quirky humor that the franchise is known for, and replaces it with a more serious tone. Gameplay Inspired by the three-dimensional The Legend of Zelda games with some role-playing game elements, the player assumes the role of Goemon, who is set once again to save Japan. Goemon is able to use a large variety of weapons (including his trademark pipe), as well as equip sub-weapons, items and magic, which can be assigned in 4 hexagons for quick use. Another twist is the addition of a white tiger known as Kotora, whom Goemon can use to attack enemies when he locks on them. Localization attempts The now-defunct company Working Designs attempted to bring the game to English audiences as Mystical Ninja Goemon beginning in 2002. Motivated to promote a series \\"that's never quite received the recognition it deserves here [in the United States],\\" Working Designs displayed the game in its booth at E3 the same year. Mystical Ninja Goemon remained on the studio's release list until its closing in 2005; it is rumored that Sony squashed the game's North American release due to subpar graphics.

The battery has an output power of 200 kW, making up around 3% of total capacity, and could be used to smooth the substantial variability in wind output over minutes to hours. When used in conjunction with a variable resistive load, a higher wind penetration is possible, permitting the substantial second to second variability to be controlled with the resistor, reducing the need to spill excess wind through throttling of the turbines. A short-term peak output of 400 kW can be supplied. As a result, there has been a substantial reduction in the use of diesel fuel, however the full diesel capacity must be maintained, including the need to maintain spinning reserve for system security.

Back Stage is a 1919 American two-reel silent comedy film directed by and starring Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle and featuring Buster Keaton and Al St. John. In this film, Keaton, Arbuckle, Al St. John, and others work back stage as stagehands in a playhouse trying to help out and, in some cases, stay away from the eccentric performers. When the performers rebel and refuse to do the show, the stagehands, along with Arbuckle's love interest (the assistant of one of the rebelling performers) perform in their stead‚Äîincluding Keaton doing butterflies and no-handed cartwheels in drag. Several Arbuckle shorts use sight gags that other comedians elaborated on in other films. In Back Stage, Arbuckle uses the falling wall sequence, where a piece of set falls on him but a window in the set piece allows him to escape being crushed. Keaton used this gag in his first short One Week (1920) and, most famously, in his 1928 film Steamboat Bill, Jr. Plot Fatty, Keaton and St John play stagehands at a theater preparing the sets for the next big show. Fatty puts up a sign on the front door of the theater reading: YOU MUST NOT MISS GERTRUDE McSKINNY FAMOUS STAR WHO WILL PLAY THE LITTLE LAUNDRESS FIRST TIME HERE TOMORROW AT 2PM But upon returning inside the theatre he unwittingly leaves the door open so it obscures the left side of the sign and appears to read: MISS SKINNY WILL UNDRESS HERE AT 2PM The evening's entertainment arrives, first an extremely flexible dancer whom Fatty and Keaton feebly attempt to mimic. Next, a tall and egotistical, strongman who badly mistreats his assistant (Mahone). The staff attempt to defend the assistant but the strongman is so powerful that he is able to blow Fatty away using only his breath and does not even flinch when Keaton repeatedly hits him over the head with an axe. Eventually the staff manage to subdue the strongman by challenging him to prove his immense strength by lifting a heavy weight then electrocuting him. That night the theater is completely full (due to the partially obscured sign) but due to his treatment earlier the strongman quits and takes the dancer with him forcing Fatty, Keaton and the assistant to plan an operetta, which they title \\"The Falling Reign\\", at short notice. Fatty and Keaton dress in drag and perform an elaborate dance act. The dancer who quit earlier is in the audience and frequently heckles the show but is soon dispatched when Keaton's dancing proves to energetic and launches him into the audience knocking the dancer out. The second act is a routine in which Fatty and Keaton are being covered with fake snow but the theater is so hot that Keaton has to fan himself and take off his coat, ruining the illusion. Things are made worse when the man slowly releasing the fake snow accidentally drops the whole bag onto Fatty, and during a scene where Fatty is serenading the assistant who sits in the window of the facade of a house, Keaton accidentally bumps into it knocking it over and causing it to fall towards Fatty but the open window fits neatly around his body saving him from harm. Despite the show being a disaster, the audience nevertheless applaud and roar with laughter, believing the performers fumbles to be part of the act. The strongman, sitting in the audience, is outraged that his assistant is now a success. He produces a gun and shoots her before starting a brawl with the entire stage team. As Keaton and St John keep the strongman busy, Fatty loads a trunk full of weights and drops it on the strongman's head, knocking him out. The short ends with Fatty visiting the assistant in the hospital who is recovering well.

The technique continued to be used throughout the age of the Roman Empire, even after the introduction of mortar, and was often used in addition to other techniques. The type of stone, the size of the blocks, and the way the blocks were put together can all be used to help archaeologists date structures that display the technique. =Etruscan way= In early usage (often called the \\"Etruscan way\\"), the joints between the block introduce discontinuities, making the blocks uneven. Examples of such construction can be found in reservoirs, basements, terrace walls, and temple podiums in Etruscan cities and Rome. =Greek way= Subsequently (the \\"Greek way\\"), the blocks would be placed in one of two rotations. \\"Stretchers\\" would be placed so the longer side was on the face of the wall, and \\"headers\\" would be placed so the shorter side was on the face of the wall, and would thus extend further back into the wall thickness. Various patterns could be produced by changing how the blocks were placed, and it was common to strengthen the wall by ensuring that the joints between blocks were centered over the blocks in the row below. =Roman concrete= With the introduction of Roman concrete, continuous outer walls were often constructed, with some blocks laid as headers in order to attach to the inner wall. Tile or marble can be found cemented to such walls, but this was less common for those structures that were particularly load-bearing, such as arches and pillars used for bridges and aqueducts.

The publishers decided to change the format of the title, but kept the name for their new adventure hero. Jo-Jo was another in Fox Feature Syndicate's long line of Tarzanesque characters. Like Tarzan, Jo-Jo wore a loin-cloth, lived in the jungle, and spoke a form of broken English (similar to Johnny Weissmuller's version of Tarzan). Some of the episodes were given credit of Stan Ford (a pseudonym). Jo-Jo's love interest in the first issue was Gwenna; she was replaced (never to be mentioned again) by Tanee. Both Gwenna and Tanee shared two things in common: they were scantily clad, and they spent a much of their time tied up. Because of the risque images found in the issues of Jo-Jo, many of them provided by Jack Kamen and Matt Baker, Dr. Fredric Wertham mentioned issue #15 in his book Seduction of the Innocent. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"Jo-Jo fights wild beasts, wicked white men and natives, the Flaming Fiend, the Mistress of the Apes, the Doctor of Doom, and the Tarantula Men.\\" The last issue of Jo-Jo, Congo King was #29 (July 1949); the title was then changed to My Desire (a romance comic). Jo-Jo reappeared in 1950, now renamed Jungle Jo. This version ran for four issues. Fox Feature Syndicate declared bankruptcy in 1950, selling off many of its creative assets. Versions of Jo-Jo appeared in comics produced by various publishers.
