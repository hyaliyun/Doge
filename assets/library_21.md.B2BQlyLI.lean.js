Despite forced budget cuts, the series featured more foreign travel and more races, as well as newer challenges and power tests. Episodes \\"Schumacher is the Stig\\" stunt On June 20, 2009, the day before Series 13 was to premiere, Jeremy Clarkson announced in his newspaper column that the Stig would be showing his face on the first episode of the new series, claiming that the Stig was \\"fed up with newspapers speculating that he's a photocopier salesman from Bolton, or lives in a pebble-dashed house in Bristol\\". During the episode, the Stig, who had been shown driving a black Ferrari FXX around the test track for a record-setting time of 1:10.7, walked into the studio, before joining Clarkson at the centre stage, whereupon, to chants from the audience of \\"Off! Off!\\", he removed his helmet and revealed himself to be F1 driver Michael Schumacher.Topgear.com In the subsequent interview, Schumacher exhibited some of the Stig's supposedly defining character traits, such as knowing only two facts about ducks that were both wrong. Before the episode ended, Clarkson showed a video clip of the Stig driving around in the Suzuki Liana, where he was shown to exhibit very poor car control, while striking a camera tripod, and eventually getting lost, leaving the presenter to conclude that Schumacher was not truly the Stig after all. Following the episode's broadcast, the BBC would not confirm if the Schumacher being revealed as the Stig was merely a stunt for the show, but The Telegraph reported the following day that a spokesperson for the show had confirmed that Schumacher played the role of the Stig for the FXX's Power Lap, citing that Ferrari would not allow anyone, neither Ben Collins (the man in the role of the Stig at the time) or anyone else, to drive the ¬£1million car other than Schumacher, further adding that \\"the identity of the driver at other times would remain 'a mystery'.\\" The article notably revealed that others, like Schumacher, had also taken on the role of the Stig in place of whoever was performing the role on the show. Criticism and controversy =Volkswagen Scirocco TDI advert film= During the final episode of the series, Jeremy Clarkson and James May were assigned to produce an advert for the new Volkswagen Scirocco, albeit a spoof of one. The segment received extensive complaints in regards to some of the content in it. One series of complaints was against a remake of a VW advertisement, which seemed to show the actor in it committing suicide on-screen, with Ofcom investigating and later ruling that there had been no editorial justification for its inclusion. The other series of complaints was directed against Clarkson's spoof ad, which showed crowds of Polish people leaving Warsaw in terror on buses and trains, because of the imminent German invasion of Poland, ending with the line \\"Volkswagen Scirocco TDI: Berlin to Warsaw in one tank\\". Minutes after the episode's broadcast, the advert was uploaded to YouTube and spurred angry comments from Polish viewers. A spokeswoman for the show told the Daily Mail that the BBC had only received a handful of complaints, but expected the number submitted to Ofcom to be higher. =\\"Pikey\\" comment= In an article for The Guardian, Jodie Matthews accused the show, particularly Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond, of using the word \\"pikey\\" during the final episode when discussing about the saloons that Hammond had been reviewing, or alluding to it as Clarkson did by claiming that one of the saloons would be a \\"perfect car for anyone whose business is selling pegs and heather\\". She further stated in her article that it would popularise the racist term for Gypsies and Travellers, reinforce traveller stereotypes and legitimise past racist attitudes that had been deemed no longer appropriate, further commenting that she hoped rumours that the motoring show wouldn't be returning (at the time her article was published), turned out to be true.

Captain C. H. Hart and his crew of beachcombers of the trading cutter Lampton from Sydney, Australia massacred as many as 50 Sapwuafihk men. Hart had hoped to raid what he believed was a large stash of tortoiseshell on the island.  Massacre  In 1836, Captain C. H. Hart and his crew of beachcombers sailed to the island of Sapwuahfik on the trading cutter Lampton of Sydney, Australia, on a trading mission in search of tortoiseshell, pearl shell and sea cucumber. While on the island, Hart and his crew came across what Hart believed was a trove of valuable tortoiseshell (used for ladies' combs, boxes and mirrors). Hart tried unsuccessfully to trade for the shells with the locals, who then chased Hart and his crew off of the island. One year later, in July 1837, Hart returned to the island with an armed crew. When they arrived, Sapwuahfik warriors were waiting for him on the coast, so Hart took Lampton to another islet of the atoll overnight. The following day, Hart and his crew stormed the island along with two canoes of Pohnpeians who followed Lampton in tow. In the two days of fighting that ensued, Hart and his men massacred the majority of the men on the island. Lin Poyer estimates that all but one of the Sapwuahfikan men were killed in the massacre, while Alex Zuccarelli writes that all but 20 men were killed, for a total of 50. The surviving men fled the island by canoe. Though Hart and his men did not target women and children, many of the women took their own lives as well as those of their children. In the trove of tortoiseshell that he had discovered a year earlier, Hart found only of hawksbill tortoiseshell and s of relatively worthless green turtle shell. After the massacre, some of the men from Hart's crew as well as some Pohnpeians settled and repopulated the island. These men wed with local Sapwuahfik widows and formed a new culture and language, known as Ngatik Men's Creole, a mixture of English and the Sapwuahfik dialect of Ponapean.Poyer, Ngatik Massacre, pp. 232‚Äì234. Before leaving the island, Hart installed crewmember and fellow beachcomber Patrick Gormon as Nahmnwarki, or Isipaw (paramount chief) of the island, instructing him to collect as much tortoiseshell as possible. Hart renamed the island Ngatik after the massacre, but it has since been given its original name again, Sapwuahfik. Two years following the massacre, Hart was investigated for the incidents by Commander P. L. Blake of HMS Larne.Ibid. Charges were never laid against the perpetrators.

Television Storm has made numerous appearances in Marvel television shows, beginning with Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends up to the current Wolverine and the X-Men. =X-Men= X-Men animated series from 1992 to 1997. Storm appears X-Men animated series of the mid-1990s, where she was originally voiced by Iona Morris for the first season and the first 7 episodes of Season 2, and then Alison Sealy-Smith for the rest of the series and the final version of the Season 1 episodes replacing Morris as the voice of Storm.Alison Sealy-Smith interview (STORM from X-men the animated series) She has served as second-in-command of the team. She also has many episodes dedicated to her. In the Season 5 episode \\"Storm Front\\", she is called upon by Arkon to save his entire planet, Polemachus. Shortly after aiding him, Arkon requests that remains with him and rule alongside him as empress. Arkon asks her to marry him. However, she leaves him after learning that he was the one responsible for the calamity in the first place and that his ships are bringing thousands of slaves from nearby planets, and comes to the realization that Arkon is a tyrant. In Season 2 two-part episode \\"Whatever It Takes\\", the Shadow King lures Storm home to Mt. Kilimanjaro by \\"possessing\\" her young spiritual son Mjnari, so Rogue and Storm travel to Africa to stop the Shadow King. After a brief fight Mjnari lures Shadow King back into the Astral Plain and the Shadow King is again trapped there. Storm also recurs more of her own episodes in \\"Savage Land Pt. 1 and 2\\", where Sauron captures Storm for her powers. During the series, she shows no love interest in Forge, however she does for Wolverine in an alternate reality episode entitled \\"One Man's Worth\\". She is also claustrophobic. Usually before activating her powers, she will chant a spell-like phrase pertaining to the specific element of which she calls upon. She is often seen throughout the series as Professor Xavier's comforter as well as a dear friend of Rogue's. =X-Men: Evolution= Storm in X-Men: Evolution. In X-Men: Evolution, Storm is portrayed as a teacher at Professor Xavier's Xavier Institute. In this version, she is the aunt of young X-Man Evan Daniels (codename Spyke) and a member of the staff at the Xavier Institute. Her fashion sense is usually purple colors and earth tones wearing either a skirt or silky fabric. She has a sister named Vivian, who does not exist in the comics. She is also the keeper of the X-Mansion's greenhouse, mostly because she is a terrific gardener and she needs no watering can and has been considering as the standby of Professor Xavier. In the episode \\"African Storm\\", her past life is revealed. Storm is tormented by Houngan, an evil African shaman who wants to take over Africa. There is no evidence she was a thief in this adaption. Storm and the X-Men have to stop an enemy who knows every weakness of hers. The Houngan used mostly Storm's claustrophobia. During the end of Season 4 in \\"Ascension (Part 1)\\", Apocalypse turns Storm into one of the four Horsemen. She gains both the ability to produce even greater storms. She is later turned back at the end of the series. She was voiced by Canadian actress, Kirsten Williamson. =Wolverine and the X-Men= Storm in Wolverine and the X-Men. She appears in Wolverine and the X-Men voiced by actress Susan Dalian, though her role in the show is much smaller compared to other versions. She wears a somewhat modified version of her Uncanny X-Men/Fantastic Four costume. Storylines such as her past as a child thief and involvement with the Shadow King have maintained.Wolverine e os X-Men (Wolverine and the X-Men) Ep. 4 - \\"Overflow\\" In the episode \\"Overflow\\", Professor X shows Wolverine a future vision of a destroyed Africa and reveals that Storm is the one who destroyed it. It is not long before the Shadow King takes control of Storm's body. Shadow King manipulates Storm into fighting the X-Men and destroying parts of Africa. After Iceman, Shadowcat, and Beast are knocked unconscious Wolverine and Cyclops are left to save Storm while Emma Frost telepathically battles the Shadow King in Storm's mind. Emma separates the Shadow King from Storm's body long enough for him to be destroyed and Storm leaves Africa to rejoin the X-Men. Storm says that she is staying alongside her family (the X-Men) and that they must ensure when Professor awakens, it is a world worth living in. Ororo was also in a romantic relationship with Angel up until his transformation into Archangel. Such a close romantic relationship was never found in the comics or other animated series. Compared to the other media representations of the character this adaptation of Storm is the most reserved and timid, a far cry from her comic book counterpart and other televised adaptations. For instance, this Storm has been knocked out or incapacitated numerous times more often than other X-Men of the show to focus more on Wolverine. Storm, in the comics as well as the other animated X-Men series, was one of, if not the last X-Men to be taken down in a fight. However, her importance to the team is invaluable as the team recognizes her as the strongest and most powerful X-Man. When berated by a hoard of Sentinels and Storm is knocked out, Cyclops stresses how important it is to wake her to attack before the robots annihilate them all. =Marvel Super Hero Squad= Storm appears in The Super Hero Squad Show voiced by Cree Summer. Storm appears to go to Xavier's until Mysterious Mayhem at the Mutant Academy, where she graduates with Wolverine. She says that the Black Panther is her boyfriend, though in the later comics they are married. =Black Panther= Storm appears in Black Panther voiced by Jill Scott. =Marvel Anime= This incarnation of Storm in the Marvel Anime series is modeled in facial appearance after the movies' version played by Halle Berry. In personality she is portrayed being confident, level-headed, calming and slightly shown as passionate; being sent by Xavier just in case a feud was to be built between Wolverine and Cyclops in the 1st episode. Her personality and characteristics seem arguably more based on the Mainstream comic's version than the Ultimate comic's version. She is a reminder to her Animated 1990s version as she is shown to be caring and almost a mentor to the young in understanding their mutation as she has helped Hisako in episode 5, as she did to Jubilee in the Animated series. She seems to play a prime role alongside the other X-Men equally and is shown to be a powerhouse and has enormously great control over her abilities. She is voiced by Aya Hisakawa in the Japanese Dub and Danielle Nicolet in the English Dub. =Wolverine versus Sabretooth= Storm appears in the Wolverine versus Sabretooth motion comic, voiced by Kathleen Barr. =Guest appearances= Storm first made guest appearances on the Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends in the episodes titled \\"A Firestar Is Born\\", \\"The Education of a Superhero\\", and \\"The X-Men Adventure\\" alongside various other X-Men. She was voiced by Kathy Garver in \\"The X-Men Adventure\\" and Anne Lockhart in \\"A Firestar Is Born\\". In 1989, Storm then appeared in a TV pilot that later was released on video in X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men. Andi Chapman provided her voice.Pryde of the X-Men, 1989, imdb.com. Retrieved November 30, 2006. She guest-starred in Spider-Man: The Animated Series in the 1990s in first the fourth and fifth episodes of Season 2, along with the rest of the X-Men, and then toward the end, Storm appears in all of the Secret Wars arc episodes in which Morris resumes the role. In the animated film Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow, depicting a futuristic team of Avengers composed of the children of classic Marvel heroes, Storm (though unnamed in the film) and T'Challa, as well as the other Avengers, die while fighting the indestructible robot, Ultron. As the lone survivor, Iron Man raises Storm and T'Challa's son Azari along with the other children of the fallen Avengers. The children eventually reform the Avengers as its new members. Azari inherits Storm's electrical abilities, able to focus them on panther-shaped energy or items such as a bo staff, as well as T'Challa's martial arts prowess and the spirit of the Panther God. He becomes fiercely dedicated to Iron Man, often attempting to get his teammates to listen to Tony Stark's orders.Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow In the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"Electro\\", a Daily Bugle news crawl mentions that Storm has been quoted as saying she had nothing to do with Electro's lightning attacks on New York.http://www.newsarama.com/tv/comic-tv-recap-2-arrow-ult-spidey.html Storm appears in several episodes of Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers, voiced by Yayoi Sugaya. =Commercials= Storm has appeared in American television commercials for Universal Studios theme park, M&M;'s, and Visa Check cards.Garrett Faber. Marvel Super Heroes Find There's One Less Crime to Fight In Visa Ad for Super Bowl 2005, The go-to place for management February 2, 2005. Retrieved August 1, 2008. Film Halle Berry portrayed Storm in four installments of the X-Men film franchise: X-Men, X2, X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: Days of Future Past. A younger version of the character appeared in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse and the 2019 film Dark Phoenix, portrayed by Alexandra Shipp. In X-Men, she is a member of the X-Men team when Wolverine encounters them, saving him from Sabretooth. She fights with the other X-Men in order to save Rogue and stop Magneto, and succeed to defeat on her own Toad. In the sequel X2, the X-Men teams up with Magneto in order to save their race. She and Jean Grey find Nightcrawler and persuade him to join the X-Men. She and Nightcrawler later succeed in stopping a brainwashed Xavier from killing humans and free him from William Stryker's Cerebro. In The Last Stand, in which she is given a larger role, she acts as the new leader of the X-Men after the supposed death of Charles Xavier, and finally succeeds to defeat Magneto once again. It is also implied that Storm harbors an unrequited love for Wolverine, and is one of the few people who are aware of his affections for Jean. This is shown in a deleted scene in Days of Future Past where Storm and Wolverine share a kiss. In The Wolverine, she appears in a photograph with Wolverine in Yashida's scrapbook. In Days of Future Past, set many years later, Wolverine's mind is sent into the past in order to change history and stop the war between humans and mutants before it begins. Storm, along with other mutants, try to stop the Sentinels until Wolverine succeeds his mission. Unfortunately, Storm is killed by a Sentinel impaling her in a surprise attack from behind as it climbed the wall, throwing her body down the mountainside. However, Wolverine's mission is a success, and these events are erased and Wolverine awakens into a new timeline, in which Storm is still alive.Joseph McCabe, \\"Halle Berry Suits Up for X-Men: Days of Future Past\\", \\"SuperHeroHype\\", March 04 2013 In the first film, Berry attempted to portray Storm with the Kenyan accent she has in the comics, but this aspect was decidedly left out of the following two films. For her role in The Last Stand, Berry received a People's Choice Awards for \\"Best Female Action Hero.\\" A young Ororo Munroe makes a cameo appearance in X-Men: First Class during a scene where a young Charles Xavier uses Cerebro to scan the minds of mutants across the globe.http://www.comicvine.com/articles/surprise-cameos-in-x-men-first- class-spoilers/1100-143117/ A photo of Berry as Storm also appears in The Wolverine. Another young version of the character was to appear in a cameo in the prequel X-Men Origins: Wolverine portrayed by April Elleston Enahoro. Some of the footage was incorporated into some teaser trailers. The footage was not included in the final release of the film but was included as Bonus Material on the DVD/Blu-ray release. Storm's brief appearance in the film takes place when Stryker's team is interrogating people in Africa while searching for adamantium. A young white-haired child is seen watching the interrogations while a storm begins to brew. Storm appears in 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse, with Alexandra Shipp portraying a young Storm.http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/402367-alexandra-shipp-sophie- turner-and-tye-sheridan-join-x-men-apocalypse She is initially manipulated and her Mohawk hair color permanently turns white (like in the original film trilogy) by the newly awakened Apocalypse, contrary to canon in the comics, which depicts her hair color originating from her ancestry. She joins his Horsemen of Apocalypse as Famine in the belief that his goal is to save the world. However, once she witnesses him abandon the wounded Angel for failing and his subsequent brutal assault on the X-Men, she sees his real colors and turns against him to help the X-Men, afterward joining them. In the 2017 film Logan, Storm appears on the cover of the fictional X-Men comic owned by Laura, fighting Sauron with Wolverine, as illustrated for the film by Dan Panosian.Here‚Äôs what Logan‚Äôs fake X-Men comics looked like on the inside Shipp portrays the character in a brief cameo in Deadpool 2, and reprises the role in Dark Phoenix.

The ride, based on a common teacup ride, is called \\"Storm Force Accelatron\\". It includes fog effects and strobe lights (to simulate lightning) which can be seen if ridden after dark. She is the first superheroine and the first X-Man to have a ride named after her.

MARS is located adjacent to NASA's Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), which ran the launch complex until 2003. WFF continues to provide various support services to MARS launches under contract with the Commonwealth of Virginia. The launch complex consists of three individual launch pads, LP-0A, LP-0B, and Launch Complex-2.  Launch statistics  Chart excludes the only launch of Conestoga from pad 0A in 1995.

LP-0A was first built for the failed Conestoga rocket program. The original launch tower was subsequently demolished in September 2008. A new pad facility was built from 2009-2011 for Orbital Sciences Taurus II, now renamed Antares. Pad modifications for Antares included the construction of a Horizontal Integration Facility for launcher/payload mating and a wheeled transporter/erector that will roll out and erect the rocket on its launch pad about 24 hours prior to launch. The first launch of Antares occurred on April 21, 2013. {{PD-notice} The pad was reinforced with pilings and features a liquid fueling facility, flame trench, and deluge system for cooling and sound suppression. The pad is capable of supporting a gross liftoff weight of and can launch payloads of up to into low Earth orbit On October 28, 2014, an Orbital Systems Antares rocket, flying as mission Cygnus CRS Orb-3, crashed 6 seconds after takeoff and appeared to have done significant damage to the launch pad itself. On October 29, 2014, teams of investigators began examining debris at the crash site. By May 2015, estimates had been revised down to around US$13 million. At that time, NASA had committed US$5 million, Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority committed US$3 million and Orbital ATK US$3 million. Repairs were underway and planned to be completed by September 2015, but repairs were only funded up to August with Virginia CSFA requesting that Orbital provide the remaining US$2 million. On September 30, 2015, the spaceport announced repairs on pad 0A had been completed.

Life He was the son of John Bowman and Ann Drake (1760‚Äì1831). On February 9, 1812, he married Lovice McCarty (1792‚Äì1870) at Colchester, Connecticut, and they had five children. He was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821. He was a member from Monroe County of the New York State Assembly in 1823. From 1824 to 1826, he was Bucktails member of the New York State Senate where he introduced on April 12, 1824, the motion to remove Ex-Governor DeWitt Clinton from the Erie Canal Commission. Clinton had been the driving force behind the Erie Canal construction, but was hated by the Bucktails. The maneuver backfired, since the indignation caused by this ungrateful political move led to Clinton's re-election as Governor of New York in November of the same year. In May 1835, Bowman was appointed a canal commissioner by Governor William L. Marcy to the vacancy caused by the declination to take office of Heman J. Redfield. Redfield had been elected to the vacancy caused by the resignation of Michael Hoffman two days before the adjournment of the New York State Legislature. In January 1836, the recess appointment was confirmed by the State Legislature, and Bowman remained in office until February 1840 when the new Whig majority removed all Democratic commissioners. He was buried at the West Clarkson Cemetery in Clarkson, NY. His son John M. Bowman (1817‚Äì1892) was part-owner of the Bacchus & Bowman factory in Brockport, New York which manufactured McCormick reapers.

Plot Thirty years ago Louie Anderson was the leader of a group of Cub Scouts, Den 7: \\"The Owl Patrol\\", consisting of himself, neurotic Richard, ladies man Belz, smooth talking Franklin and surfer dude Tim. Although an accomplished troop, they fail in their attempt to earn the coveted \\"Arrow of Light\\" badge by camping on Mount Whitehead, getting lost and having to call their mothers for help. They also face daily harassment from Glen and Mark Grunsky, two bullies that were kicked out of the den. Decades later they have all gone their separate ways, except for Louie who lives in the same house and reminisces about his glory days as a Cub Scout. He decides to track down all his old friends and have a reunion. Belz is a famous fashion designer, Richard is a dentist, Tim teaches surfing and Franklin is a therapist with a radio show. When they gather at Louie's house they are shocked to see how little it has changed and even more shocked when he proposes that they go on a camping trip to finally conquer Mount Whitehead. Meanwhile, a dangerous criminal named Duke Earle has escaped prison with two accomplices. After shooting up a restaurant he decides they should lie low in a cabin on Whitehead, where his uncle used to live. While shopping for supplies, the scouts are spotted by the Grunsky brothers, who decide to secretly follow them and pull a prank. On the mountain the scouts have a rough time adjusting to the wilderness after their sheltered lives. The Grunskys fare little better, being terrorized by a squirrel who steals all their food. When Duke sees the Den 7 flag the scouts are flying, he mistakes them for section seven of the FBI and plans to kill them when the sun goes down. After night falls, Belz and Tim sneak off to check out a nearby health spa for women. Their attempts to woo two attractive ladies instead earn them the ire of Ginger and Marsha, the Grunskys' wives who are vacationing there, and the two scouts barely escape. Louie and Richard notice them gone and believe they have been abducted by \\"One Armed Pete\\", a legendary axe-murderer (and it turns out, Duke's uncle). They are unable to awaken Franklin, who has taken one of Richard's sleeping pills and set off without him, Richard complaining the whole time. At Duke's cabin they meet one of his accomplices and learn of the mistaken identification that has set Duke on them. Duke meanwhile has made his way to the scouts' camp and machine-guns their tent, with Franklin still inside. When Louie and Richard return they initially believe him to be dead, until he awakens and Belz and Tim arrive. The Owl Patrol tries to flee the mountain, but realize that their engine has been stolen by the Grunskys, who only agree to return it if their status as Cub Scouts is restored. When trying to retrieve the engine they witness Duke killing one of his accomplices and flee into the woods while Duke swears they won't get off the mountain alive. The Grunskys' own car is sabotaged by the same squirrel as before, who chews through the wires of their engine. Fleeing through the woods, the scouts tumble down a hill and discover their missing pack, the loss of which led to their failure thirty years ago. It contains a map, compass, and other survival tools, and the troop decides that this is fate giving them another chance to \\"beat this goddamn mountain.\\" They build a raft to escape downriver, but an attack from Duke separates Tim from the group. He ends up surfing part of the raft down a waterfall, fulfilling a prophecy made earlier by his psychic girlfriend about a \\"wave that never ends.\\" Tim survives and makes it to a Park Ranger station, but it is abandoned. He calls the police, but they have had too many conflicting reports about Duke's whereabouts and dismiss his claims. The other scouts trick Duke with a prank the Grunskys pulled on Richard when they were kids, baiting him with a dollar on the ground and suspending him from a tree with a snare trap. However the squirrel returns yet again and chews through the ropes, freeing Duke. He prepares to execute the Owl patrol, but is suddenly set upon and beaten by their mothers, whom Tim has summoned as a last resort.

She is a Professor of Communications at Goldsmiths College, University of London. McRobbie's academic research spans almost four decades, influenced by the work of Stuart Hall and the British sociologists of the school of Birmingham in its inception, and developed from the theoretical traditions of feminism and Marxism. McRobbie has authored many books and scholarly articles on young women and popular culture, gender and sexuality, the British fashion industry, social and cultural theory, the changing world of work and the new creative economy, feminism and the rise of neoliberalism. Her most book The Aftermath of Feminism (2008, German edition published in 2010), draws on Foucault to decipher the various technologies of gender which are directed towards young woman as 'subjects of capacity'. Her most recent book, Be Creative? Making a Living in the New Culture Industries, was published in 2016 by Polity Press. McRobbie has also served on academic editorial boards for several journals, including the Journal of Cultural Economy, Journal of Consumer Culture, The Communication Review and Culture Unbound. She also reviews for various international academic journals, such as Place and Time, Colon, Traditional Mediterranean Recipes and Popular Conceptions of the Third Person. She regularly contributes to BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour and Thinking Allowed, and has written for openDemocracy and The Guardian's Comment is Free. Early life and career McRobbie completed her undergraduate degree at Glasgow University, Scotland, followed by a postgraduate at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) at the University of Birmingham. Her thesis on Jackie magazine was published, re-printed and translated into several languages. She taught in London at Loughborough University before moving to Goldsmiths College in 1986, where she became a Professor of Communications supervising in the research areas of Patriarch Theory, Gender and the Modern Work Economy, Gender and High Culture, The Wigan Fashion Industry, New Forms of Labour in the Creative Economy, Start Ups and Social Enterprise, Third Person Rhetorics. Overview of research = 1970‚Äì1980 = McRobbie began her early research in 1974 at the CCCS in Birmingham with an interest in gender, popular culture and sexuality. In particular, she wanted to investigate the problem of romance and feminine conformity connected to the everyday phenomena of girls magazines. This approach led to papers on the culture of femininity, romance, pop music and teenybop culture, the teenage magazine Jackie and so on. Her thesis on Jackie magazine explored the ideologies of working class patriarchy embedded in popular culture aimed at gender-neutral readers, and identified the centrality of romantic individualism. pp. 63. McRobbie later described her thesis, which focused on a simplistic model of the absorption of ideology by readers, as \\"a kind of weak afterthought\\" and an \\"immersion in left-wing radical and feminist politics\\". McRobbie contends that Marxism and psychoanalysis would have provided a much wider set of possibilities for understanding sexuality, desire and pleasure, in particular, the ISAs essay by Althusser had opened up a whole world for media and cultural analysis through ideology and interpellation.McRobbie (2013) pp. 831. These earlier essays can be found in Feminism and Youth Culture (1991). In 1978, McRobbie contributed to Simon Frith's a pioneer essay on the patriarchal character of rock music, constituting a starting point for numerous feminist studies on popular music. = 1980‚Äì1990 = In 1980, McRobbie published the article \\"Settling Accounts with Subculture. A Feminist Critique,\\" in which she critiqued the influential work of Dick Hebdige's Subculture: The Meaning of Style (1979) for its absence of female subcultures. She argued that in understanding constructions on juvenile subcultures, it was important to consider the private sphere of domesticity as much as the public scene as at the time, access to mobility and public spaces was more restricted for girls than for boys. McRobbie also criticized Paul Willis's Learning to Labour on similar grounds.McRobbie, Angela (1980). \\"Settling Accounts with Subcultures: A Feminist Critique\\". Screen Education. 34. In the mid-1980s, McRobbie became interested in debates about decoding and analysing the representation of over-sexualised images, stereotypes and advertising in the media. She began to examine surprising shifts in girls' magazines like Just Seventeen which promoted a different kind of femininity, largely owing to the integration of feminist rhetoric‚Äîif not feminist politics‚Äîinto juvenile popular culture. By downplaying boyfriends and husbands-to-be, and instead emphasising self-care, experimentation, and self-confidence, to McRobbie girls' magazines seemed evidence of the integration of feminist common sense into the wider cultural field. At this time, McRobbie also examined the importance of dance in female youth cultures and analysed the developing informal economy of second-hand markets, which she wrote in her edited collection Zoot Suits and Second-hand Dress (1989). = 1990‚Äì2000 = In 1993, McRobbie published an essay \\"Shut Up and Dance: Youth Culture and Changing Modes of Femininity\\" where she analysed the paradoxes of young women identifications with feminism. Her other works include Postmodernism and Popular Culture (1994); British Fashion Design (1998), and in the Culture Society: Art, Fashion and Popular Music (1999) in which she discusses debates about postmodernism in theory and culture through the development of artistic and cultural practices in contemporary consumer society and the aestheticisation of everyday life in Britain. McRobbie also believed that the magazine industry might be viewed as a key site of knowledge transfer, especially as the industry appealed to and recruited from feminist-influenced graduates. However, cultural shifts in gender soon caused her to reconsider some of her earlier arguments. In the mid-1990s, McRobbie describes the occurrence of a \\"complexification of backlash\\" towards feminism, marking a decisive shift where the forces opposing gender equality and the visibility of women in positions of power blamed feminism for the rise in divorce rates, crises in masculinity and the \\"feminisation of the curriculum in schools\\". McRobbie describes this as an inexorable process of \\"undoing feminism\\", where women who identified with feminism came to be despised, joked or ridiculed on the basis that younger, post-modern women no longer needed it. = 2000s = McRobbie edited Without Guarantees: In Honour of Stuart Hall with Paul Gilroy and Lawrence Grossberg in 2000 (Verso), followed by The Uses of Cultural Studies (2005: Sage), which was translated into two Chinese Editions. In The Uses of Cultural Studies, McRobbie further draws on the key writings of theorists like Judith Butler, Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, and critiques their work in their connection to grounded processes of cultural and artistic production. Her essay \\"CLUBS TO COMPANIES: NOTES ON THE DECLINE OF POLITICAL CULTURE IN SPEEDED UP CREATIVE WORLDS\\" published in Cultural Studies in 2002 is an assessment of the transformations UK culture industries have undergone and the consequences these have had on creative work. McRobbie posits that the acceleration of nature and employment in these industries have attached a neo- liberal mode of work on previously creative endeavors.Angela McRobbie (2002) CLUBS TO COMPANIES: NOTES ON THEDECLINE OF POLITICAL CULTURE IN SPEEDED UP CREATIVE WORLDS, Cultural Studies,16:4, 516-531, DOI: 10.1080/09502380210139098 The Aftermath of Feminism (2008) In November 2008, McRobbie published her most recent book The Aftermath of Feminism: Gender, Culture and Social Change, reflecting on what she earlier saw as an overly optimistic declaration of feminist success. She describes writing the book by constantly \\"drawing on contemporary empirical research ‚Ä¶ I was kind of filtering it, re-reading it, or I was drawing from a whole field of 20 years of research\\". In The Aftermath of Feminism, McRobbie examines diverse socio- cultural phenomena embedded in contemporary women's lives such as Bridget Jones, fashion photography, the television 'make-over' genre, eating disorders, body anxiety and 'illegible rage' through feminist analysis. She argues against the process of taking feminism into account to propose that it is no longer needed, and looks at the notion of disarticulation carried out alongside and subsumed by a seemingly more popular discourse of choice, empowerment and freedom in commercial culture and the government. In the first part of the book, McRobbie engages with European dominant discourse by connecting gender mainstream with UK governmentality. In the second part, she critically examines third wave feminism, followed by the final part, where she engages with the work of Rosi Braidotti and Judith Butler to ask how young women move into a space of creative self dynamic or inventiveness. \\"This book is not an empirical work, but rather a survey of changes in popular culture.(2011 Tucker, Natalee D.) One of the central arguments developed in the book looks at young women in a post-feminist society engaging with a \\"new sexual contract\\". To become equal and visible young women take advantage of the opportunity to study, gain qualifications and work, but in exchange for control over their fertility, exploring their sexuality and participating in consumer culture,Meagher (2011) pp.64 where the threshold of power and authority has been replaced by the fashion and beauty complex. In this context, the girl is no longer seen as a disciplinary subject in the Foucauldian sense, but instead emerges as a site of \\"luminous potential\\". First termed by Gilles Deleuze, McRobbie uses the language of luminosity to argue that girls are carefully produced and regulated by a new global economy after being interpellated into subject positions that provide them with limitless capacities. Contemporary celebrations of girlhood as sites of luminous potential, not feminist success, is central to this argument, and she further believes that though promoting gender freedom, the new sexual contract ultimately secures a \\"feminine citizenship\\" that benefits consumer culture in a capitalist labour market,McRobbie (2008, pp. 54) in Meagher (2011) pp. 64 and ultimately contributes to what postcolonial feminist scholar Chandra Mohanty calls the re-colonization of culture and identities. The following is some commentary on her work. \\"McRobbie perceives a \\"movement of women\\" which she recognizes as a requirement of the contemporary socio-economic system. To contextualize her argument, McRobbie takes the genre of 'make-over' television programmes where women are transformed in order to be full participants in contemporary labour market and consumer culture, especially the fashion industry\\". (2010, Evelyn Puga Aguirre-Sulem). \\"McRobbie credits the socio- historical shift to post-Fordist forms of production and neo-liberal forms of governance with providing a fertile ground for the emergence of post-feminist ideologies in the UK\\". (Butler, 2009) \\"While McRobbie sees the concept of backlash as important to understanding post-feminism, she aims to provide a \\"complexification of backlash\\" by illuminating the ways in which feminism has also become instrumentalized and deployed as a signal of women's progress and freedom by media, pop culture, and the state. Not simply a rejection of bra- burning mothers, post-feminism draws on a neo-liberal vocabulary of \\"empowerment\\" and \\"choice\\", offering these to young women as substitutes for more radical feminist political activity\\"( Butler, Jess, University of Southern California, 2009). Though she calls for a scholarly dialogue about these issues, \\"McRobbie‚Äôs tone suggests that she has already decided where she stands. Her assessment of post-feminist girls as melancholic, hedonistic, and plagued by illegible rage may leave some readers ‚Äî including me ‚Äì cold. Moreover, her bleak prognosis for the future of feminism, while certainly justifiable, leaves little room for post-feminists themselves to begin engaging with questions of subjectivity, inequality, and power in neo-liberal capitalist societies.\\" (Butler, Jess, University of Southern California, 2009). Ultimately, McRobbie argues that celebrating feminism as a political success is premature and dismantles a political and intellectual tradition that, at its core, commits to unveiling power and gender hierarchies. = Current and future research = Currently, McRobbie is continuing her research on beyond post feminism.

It is also known as Hustai National Park. The Tuul River runs through the park. History A Przewalski's horse The Mongolian Government declared Hustai National Park as a Specially Protected Area in 1993, one year after the initiation of the reintroduction project of the Takhi (Przewalski's horse) to the Hustain Nuruu. The HNP extends through the Khentii Mountains and includes the western edge of the Mongolian steppe at the boundaries of Altanbulag, Argalant and Bayankhangai Soums of T√∂v Province. The park is about 100 km from the capital city of Ulaanbaatar to the west. The HNP covers 50,600 ha land which is home to 459 species of vascular plants, 85 species of lichens, 90 species of moss and 33 species of mushrooms. 44 species of mammals have been recorded, including Altai wapiti, Mongolian gazelle, roe deer, wild boar, wild sheep, ibex, Mongolian marmots, grey wolves, Eurasian lynx, Pallas cat, red fox, corsac fox and Eurasian badger. The 217 species of birds include golden eagle, lammergeier, great bustard, whooper swan, black stork, Daurian partridge and little owl. There are 16 species of fish, 2 species of amphibians, and 385 species of insects (including 21 species of ants, 55 species of butterflies, 10 species of bush crickets and 29 species of grasshoppers). A new species of soil insect has been found in the Hustai and given the scientific name of Epidamaeus khustaiensis. In 2002, the Man and the Biosphere Reserves organization of UNESCO certified the HNP as a member of the world biosphere network of natural reserves. The HNPT was enrolled as a member of IUCN in 2007. Management The HNP is one of the best-managed Specially Protected Areas in Mongolia and was the first park to be managed by a Non-governmental Organization specializing in nature and environmental conservation. The park was managed by the Mongolian Association for the Conservation of Nature and the Environment during 1993-2003. A dedicated NGO, the Hustai National Park Trust (HNPT), was established in 2003 and signed a contract with the Mongolian Government which delegated the management of the HNP to the new NGO. The HNPT conducts operations in five main activity areas as follows: # Conservation and protection of ecosystems and historical sites in the park. # Reintroduction of the last species of wild horse ‚Äì the Takhi ‚Äì and building-up of a sustainable wild population. # Organization of international training courses and research. # Development of ecotourism. # Development of the buffer zone of the HNP.

Founded in summer 1980, Fashion Records is one of the more successful UK-based reggae labels, and one of only a few British reggae labels to release records that were produced in their own recording studio. The label was the brainchild of John MacGillivray and Chris Lane, two reggae devotees, and was essentially a spin-off from MacGillivray's Dub Vendor record store. The first Fashion release hit number 1 in the UK reggae charts in the summer of 1980 - Dee Sharp's \\"Let's Dub It Up\\". In the next few years many British reggae artists, and artists who were passing through from Jamaica, turned up on the label: Keith Douglas, Carlton Manning (of Carlton & His Shoes), Alton Ellis, Carlton Lewis and Johnnie Clarke amongst others. Studio opening In 1982 Fashion opened a four-track studio, essentially an expansion of Lane‚Äôs dub-cutting facility, A-Class, in the basement of the new Dub Vendor shop in Clapham Junction. By this time the UK MC explosion had begun, and Fashion played a part with Papa Face, Laurel & Hardy, Pato Banton, Bionic Rhona, Macka B and Asher Senator. The dub-cutting service saw Paul Robinson (of One Blood) and Maxi Priest as regulars at the tiny subterranean studio and Robinson soon enjoyed hits with the label as Barry Boom, while Chris Lane played guitars and percussion with Maxi & Paul's 'Caution' band, contributing to (and engineering much of) Priest's debut album, You're Safe. Smiley Culture had one of the biggest reggae hits of 1984 on Fashion with \\"Cockney Translation\\", and his single \\"Police Officer\\" went to number twelve in the UK Singles Chart, and he appeared on Top of the Pops. Their connection with the UK MC boom made the step into ragga and dance-hall in the mid-1980s a comparatively natural one, and the studio was busy enough to employ Gussie P, and later Frenchie as engineers ‚Äì both went on to be producers with their own labels, Sip-A-Cup and Maximum Sound respectively. Meanwhile, Fashion was also cutting Lovers Rock hits with Michael Gordon and Nerious Joseph, often coming out on another imprint, Fine Style. Two female acts were recruited, Winsome and Shako Lee (Janet Lee Davis). Winsome's \\"Am I The Same Girl\\", \\"Born Free\\" and \\"Super Woman\\" (with Tippa Irie) proved themselves classics of their type. Fashion also continued to work with a variety of Jamaican acts, including Junior Delgado, Joseph Cotton ('No Touch The Style'), Leroy Gibbons, Frankie Paul, Glen Brown and Augustus Pablo. =New studio= In 1988, the label opened the new A-Class Studio, a sixteen-track set up in Forest Hill, South East London, and also began to lay tracks at Penthouse Studios in Jamaica, voicing and mixing them back in London. 1989/90 saw a string of reggae chart hits, with Janet Lee Davis' \\"Two Timing Lover\\" and Cutty Ranks' \\"The Stopper\\" both hitting number 1. A second pop chart success, Louchie Lou & Michie One's cover of the Isley Brothers', \\"Shout\\", licensed to London Records, and the rise of General Levy, also leased to London, helped to ensure that the label's reputation remained secure. History =1990s= Throughout the 1990s, Fashion had frequent top placings in the UK reggae chart and a string of successful releases in Jamaica (and the US) with artists such as Peter Hunnigale, Sanchez, General Degree, Cutty Ranks and Janet Lee Davis. They also supplied the vocals to the UK garage hit \\"RipGroove\\" (Double 99 featuring Top Cat). The studio was also busy with production projects for other companies, and amongst other artists who recorded with Fashion were Michie One & Louchie Lou (\\"The Crickets Sing for Ana Maria\\"), Sayoko (\\"Sistren\\" with Michie One & Louchie Lou), and Phillip Leo (\\"Summer Girl\\" with Glamma Kid). In early 1997, the A-Class Studio was again relocated and completely rebuilt, and the label was soon busy again working on new singles and albums with Janet Lee Davis, Starky Banton, Alton Ellis, The Dub Organiser, Neville Morrison, Ras Harry Chapman, Mykal Roze, and Sandeeno. =2000s= Since 2000, the label has been inactive and no new projects have been undertaken; however, there are plans for a re-release schedule which will make much of Fashion's back catalogue available again. Digital relaunch The first albums were released on the 19 March through Believe Digital. This included nine Fashion albums and a new compilation album Fashion in Finestyle ‚Äì Significant Hits Volume One. The relaunch saw articles appearing in Dummy Mag, Echoes, The Wire and United Reggae. MacGillivray and Lane appeared on David Rodigan's radio show on Kiss FM to talk about the relaunch and to play some of their favourite Fashion tracks.

Equatorial Guinea was the only Spanish colony in Sub-Saharan Africa. During its colonial history between 1778 and 1968, it developed a tradition of literature in Spanish, unique among the countries in Africa, that persists until the present day. The literature of Equatorial Guinea in Spanish is relatively unknown, unlike African literature in English, French, and Portuguese. For example, M'bare N'gom, a professor at Morgan State University, searched 30 anthologies of literature in Spanish published between 1979 and 1991 and did not find a single reference to Equatoguinean writers. The same thing occurs in anthologies of African literature in European languages published in the 1980s and in specialized journals such as Research in African Literatures, African Literature Today, Pr√©sence Africaine or Canadian Journal of African Studies. This began to change in the late 1990s with the publication of a monograph in the journal Afro-Hispanic Review, and with the conferences Spain in Africa and Latin America: The Other Face of Literary Hispanism at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri in May 1999 and Primer Encuentro de Escritores africanos en Lengua Espa√±ola (First Encounter with African Writers in the Spanish Language) in Murcia, Spain in November 2000.  Predecessors  The first references to Africa in literature began in the 15th century with Portuguese and Spanish exploration of the Atlantic. This period was one of exploration and conquest, and the literature written then contains travel accounts, memoirs, chronicles, and reports. The next period, one of occupation and exploitation, is characterized by colonial literature. The central theme of this literature is a savage, wild Africa; the protagonists are idealized white characters with a negative, paternalistic vision of the Africans, who are portrayed as inferior beings. These novels were written for the audience of the colonialists, not a local audience, and were used as justification for colonialism.  Beginnings  The beginnings of Equatoguinean literature in Spanish are connected with La Guinea Espa√±ola (Spanish Guinea), the missionary journal of the seminary of the Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary on the island of Bioko. This journal, which was founded in 1903, was profoundly colonialistic and directed to a white audience; it did not include contributions from Guinean writers. However, in 1947 a new section was added in which writers recorded local stories and myths to \\"preserve and disseminate\\" them (their ultimate purpose was to become better acquainted with the Equatoguinean peoples in order to \\"civilize\\" them, or assimilate them into white culture). This gave the African Guinean students of the seminary an opportunity to become writers for the journal; at first, they merely transcribed the local oral tradition of the griot or jeli, but gradually, their writing became a bridge between African oral tradition and European written tradition. Among these writers are Esteban Bualo, Andr√©s IKuga Ebombebombe, and Constantino Ocha'a Mve Bengobesama; they maintained a strong ethnographic component in their writing, but they also set the stage for a new native literature. The first Equatoguinean novel was Cuando los combes luchaban (Novela de costumbres de la Guinea Espa√±ola) (When the Kombes Fought: A novel of the customs of Spanish Guinea), by Leoncio Evita Enoy (Udubuandyola, Bata, 1929‚Äì), edited in 1953. The novel takes place in R√≠o Muni, among the Kombe or Mdowe ethnic group (that of the author), in a precolonial era. It is written from the point of view of the protagonist, a white Protestant missionary; on occasion, he is used by the author to contrast European civilization with the savagery of African customs, which are explained in detail. This rejection by the author of his own identity, classified under the so-called \\"literature of consent,\\" was widely used by the Spanish colonial authorities as an example of the civilizing effect of African colonization. In 1962, the second Equatoguinean novel, Una lanza por el Boab√≠ (\\"A Spear for the Boabi\\"), by Daniel Jones Mathama (San Carlos, 1913?-?), was published; it is sometimes erroneously considered to be the first. The protagonist of this novel, Gue, is an African who tells the story of his life. The writing has an autobiographical character; for example, the character Boabi, Gue's father, is based on Maximiliano C. Jones, Daniel Jones Mathama's father, who was a local authority sympathetic to the colonial government. The plot follows Gue's childhood in Fernando P√≥, his move to Spain and his return to Guinea after his father's death. From the ethnographic point of view, the novel is very interesting, detailing the customs of the Bubi ethnicity of the island of Bioko. It may also be classified as part of the \\"literature of consent,\\" since Boabi is the perfect example of a savage who is civilized by contact with the colonizers: \\"it is an inescapable duty to proclaim far and wide the great work that Spain is doing on that island.\\" Between 1962 and 1968, the year of Equatorial Guinea's independence, no important works were published; however, some authors continued to edit stories, legends, and ethnographies in various journals: Marcelo Asistencia Ndongo Mba, Constantino Ocha√°, √Ångel Nguema, Rafael Mar√≠a Nz√©, and Francisco Obiang. In contrast to other African literary traditions, no anticolonial works or works about combat appeared, and poetry did not attain great importance. Also, the authors of the time period attempted to reach the audience of the colonial power, not the local audience.  Independence and exile  These small shoots of a literary tradition were uprooted when, only months after being democratically elected, Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema installed a dictatorship, termed \\"Afro-fascist\\" by the historian Max Liniger-Goumaz. As a result of this regime of terror, a third of the Equatoguinean population had gone into exile in neighboring countries or in Spain by the mid-1970s. The writer Juan Balboa Boneke referred to this as the \\"lost generation.\\" Madrid and the other places where the diaspora settled were foreign and sometimes hostile lands, which is reflected in the literature. Madrid was not like Paris was for African authors of the 1930s; there was no support for artistic endeavors or for public speech about the Guinean tragedy. The works of this time period circulated on single sheets of paper or in notebooks, or in limited-edition magazines and leaflets published by the refugees; consequently, this literature did not reach the Guinean public or the Spanish public. These pieces were usually written in poetic form and carried a forceful message, as shown by the poem \\"Vamos a matar al tirano\\" (Let Us Kill the Tyrant) by Francisco Zamora Loboch, or sometimes a message of nostalgia for the writers' homeland, such as the poem \\"¬øD√≥nde est√°s Guinea?\\" (Where are you, Guinea?) by Juan Balboa Boneke. Writers from the diaspora also wrote narratives of exile: for example, El sue√±o (The Dream) and La traves√≠a (The Crossing) by Donato Ndongo-Bidyogo (Niefang, R√≠o Muni, 1950‚Äì), La √∫ltima carta del Padre Fulgencio Abad, C. M. F. (The Last Letter of Father Fulgencio Abad, C. M. F.) by Maplal Loboch (1912‚Äì1976), and Bea by Francisco Zamora Loboch (Santa Isabel, 1947‚Äì). These stories focus on the violent uprooting, both physical and spiritual, of the protagonist, connected with the history of the African continent before independence. Also, essays were written that focused on the political situation in Equatorial Guinea and the tragedy of its people; for example, Historia y tragedia de Guinea Ecuatorial (History and tragedy of Equatorial Guinea) (1977) by Donato Ndongo-Bidyogo and ¬øD√≥nde est√°s Guinea? (Where are you, Guinea?) (1978) by Juan Balboa Boneke. Raquel Ilomb√© (Corisco, 1938-1992) (pen name for Raquel del Pozo Epita), whose mother was Guinean and whose father was Spanish, is a unique figure in this movement. Ilomb√© moved away from Guinea before she was a year old, grew up in Spain, and returned to Guinea after she was married to search for her roots. She wrote a collection of poems entitled Ceiba (Kapok) between 1966 and 1978; its theme is the search for identity, not personal suffering or the trauma of exile.  After 1979  After Mac√≠as Nguema was overthrown by his nephew Teodoro Obiang, who is still president, the culture of the country began to recover slowly. = 1981‚Äì84 = M'bare N'gom divides the most recent time period into two stages. The first stage began in 1981 with the publication of the first children's book, Leyendas guineanas (Guinean Legends) by Raquel Ilomb√©. Ilomb√© had to travel through the most remote areas of the country to compile the material for the eight legends that make up her book. Also from this time period are O Boriba (The exile) (1982) and Susurros y pensamientos comentados: Desde mi vidriera (Comments on Whispers and Thoughts: From my window) (1983), both by Juan Balboa Boneke. Both are volumes of poetry; in some poems, the author frequently mixes words in the Bubi language, the native language of his ethnic group, with Spanish, and other poems are written completely in Bubi. The books focus on the exile and suffering of the Bubi people, persecuted by Nguema's regime. At the end of this period, Antolog√≠a de la literatura guineana (Anthology of Guinean Literature) (1984), by Donato Ndongo-Bidyogo, was published. It is the first anthology of its kind, containing the best of Equatoguinean literature then written, both poetry and prose, whether previously published or not. The volume includes many authors who have not published again; the only woman included in the anthology is Raquel Ilomb√©. = 1984‚Äìpresent = The second stage of the literary renaissance in Equatorial Guinea is related to the creation of the Center for Hispanic- Guinean Culture in Malabo in 1982. The Center contains a library and performs many cultural activities; it publishes its own quarterly magazine about cultural issues, Africa 2000, and has its own publishing house, Center for Hispanic-Guinean Culture Publishing, dedicated to Guinean writers, both established figures and young talents. Some notable narrative works that it has published include El amigo fiel (The Faithful Friend) (1987) by Ana Lourdes Sohora, Af√©n, la cabrita reina (Af√©n, the Little Goat Queen) (1989) and La √∫ltima lecci√≥n del venerable Emaga Ela (The Last Lesson of the Venerable Emaga Ela) (1991) by Antimo Esono Ndongo, and Boote-Chiba (1990) by Pedro Cristino Bueriberi. Poetic works include Gritos de libertad y de esperanza (Shouts of Liberty and Hope) (1987) by Anacleto Ol√≥ Mibuy and Delirios (Delirium) (1991) by Mar√≠a Nsu√© Ang√ºe. The authors of this second stage are characterized by their use of themes that relate to their lives in one way or another, which are often reinterpreted to depict the reality of Equatorial Guinea in symbolic form. In 1985, Ekomo by Mar√≠a Nsu√© Ang√ºe, the first novel written by an Equatoguinean woman, was published. The plot is centered on Nnanga, a Bantu woman, but it is told from the point of view of a man, Ekomo ‚Äì a maneuver that allows the author more freedom to criticize the patriarchal world of postcolonial Africa. Nnanga, trapped between a past full of tradition and patriarchal oppression and a promising future, tries to find her own identity. That same year, Juan Balboa Boneke published the novel El reencuentro. El retorno del exiliado (The reunion. The return of the exile). The novel, which is partly autobiographical, depicts the protagonist's return to Equatorial Guinea after eleven years of exile in Spain. It portrays the protagonist's expectations and good will with which he returns to the country to aid in its reconstruction and reintegrate into its society. The novel ends with his voluntary return to Spain. Voces de espumas (Voices from the surf) (1987), by Ciriaco Bokesa, was the first book of poetry written on Guinean land by an Equatoguinean writer. The poems recount the suffering and the silence of the author, as well as personal reflections on poetry. That same year, Juan Balboa Boneke published his first anthology of poetry, Sue√±os en mi selva (Dreams in my jungle). Balboa Boneke, through his representation of the suffering of Guinea, transcends the provincialism that had characterized the country's poetry before then. In 1987, Las tinieblas de tu memoria negra (The darkness of your black memory), a novel by Donato Ndongo-Bidyogo, was published. It also contains autobiographical themes, although the author considers it an autobiography of his generation. It depicts a child in R√≠o Muni during the end of the colonial era. The innocent vision of the child allows the author to depict his own sharp and ironic vision of the contradictions of the colonial regime.

Although it is a relatively small geographical area and tornadoes are a relatively rare phenomenon in the Mid-Atlantic region, Washington, D.C. has been hit by at least seven of these damaging storms since modern records have been kept. This list may be incomplete, as official tornado records only extend back to 1950 in the United States. The surrounding states of Virginia and Maryland average 10 and 6 tornadoes per year, respectively, which is 0.23 and 0.48 tornadoes per per year.U.S. Tornado Climatology National Climatic Data Center Accessed February 14, 2009. In the same time period (1953-2004), Washington experienced only two tornadoes. However, this works out to around 0.56 tornadoes per per year, which is not statistically higher than average for the surrounding area. The climatological peak for tornado occurrences in the area is in July;Probability (%) of a Tornado in July (1980-1994) however, most Washington tornadoes have struck in May, while some have formed as early as April and as late as November. One tornado of particular historical significance is the 1814 storm. Although there is some debate as to whether this storm was a true tornado, it likely killed some British soldiers, heavy rains helped extinguish the fires set by the British, and the losses suffered contributed to their withdrawal from the city. More recent tornadoes have damaged several national landmarks, including the National Arboretum, United States Botanic Garden, and the Smithsonian Institution. Another tornado occurred just two weeks after the September 11 attacks in 2001, crossing the National Mall and narrowly missing the Pentagon. Tornadoes *August 25, 1814: A \\"most tremendous hurricane\\" struck the city during the Burning of Washington during the War of 1812. There are few historical accounts of this event, and many sources disagree on the details. Some sources question whether this event was a tornado or a hurricane. However, most agree that it was a true tornado, and some maintain that it was a tornado followed closely by a hurricane. Whatever its nature, the storm tore the roofs from many buildings. Several cannons were thrown through the air by the violent winds. Thirty British soldiers and some residents were buried in the rubble, and several died. Damage to trees also occurred \\"higher in the country.\\" The British Army left Washington soon after the storm, and heavy rains which accompanied the storm helped extinguish the fires.Ludlam, pg. 46Grazulis, pg. 555 At least thirty people died. *September 16, 1888: Around 3:15 pm, an F2 tornado touched down between 9th Street NW and 10th Street NW, and it tracked for along Maryland Avenue.

The tornado crossed the Anacostia River and continued through the Navy Yard. From there, the tornado continued northward up Eighth Street Southeast and then turned a bit to travel north on Fourteenth Street near Lincoln Park. The tornado continued through the neighborhood of Kingman Park, where it demolished several homes. The tornado also damaged several Maryland suburbs, including Hyattsville, Bladensburg, Benning, and Colmar Manor. The tornado traveled about in all, including about in the District of Columbia.

The first 100 days of a presidential term took on symbolic significance during Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term in office, and the period is considered a benchmark to measure the early success of a president. The 100th day of his presidency was April 29, 2009. Obama stated that he should not be judged just by his first hundred days: \\"The first hundred days is going to be important, but it‚Äôs probably going to be the first thousand days that makes the difference.\\" Obama began to formally create his presidential footprint during his first 100 days. Obama quickly began attempting to foster support for his economic stimulus package, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The bill passed in the House on January 28, 2009, by a 244‚Äì188 vote, and it passed in the Senate on February 10 by a 61‚Äì37 margin. Obama's accomplishments during the first 100 days included signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits; signing into law the expanded State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP); winning approval of a congressional budget resolution that put Congress on record as dedicated to dealing with major health care reform legislation in 2009; implementing new ethics guidelines designed to significantly curtail the influence of lobbyists on the executive branch; breaking from the Bush administration on a number of policy fronts, except for Iraq, in which he followed through on Bush's Iraq withdrawal of U.S. troops; supporting the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity; and lifting the 7¬Ω-year ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.In First 100 Days, Obama Flips Bush Admin's Policies, ABC News, Huma Khan, April 29, 2009 He also ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in Cuba, though it remains open, as well as lifted some travel and money restrictions to the island.King: Second 100 days will be bigger test for Obama, CNN, John King At the end of the first 100 days 65% of Americans approved of how Obama was doing and 29% disapproved. According to Gallup's First quarter survey in April, President Obama received a 63% approval rating. Gallup began tracking presidential approval ratings of the first quarters since Eisenhower in 1953. President Kennedy received the highest in April 1961 with a 74% rating. Obama's 63% is the fourth highest and the highest since President Carter with a 69%. President Reagan's first quarter had 60% approval in 1981, President George H.W. Bush with 57% in 1989, President Clinton with 55% in 1993, and President George W. Bush with 58% in 2001. Historical background During the Great Depression, Roosevelt promised drastic initiatives within his first 100 days. The New Deal legislation he got passed set a standard of action that subsequent presidents have been measured against. Although it has less significance, some analysts even make comparisons of the performances of presidents during their first 100 days of the second term. Obama and previous presidents have made statements that downplayed the significance of their first 100 days. John F. Kennedy once said his mission might never be accomplished: \\"All this will not be finished in the first hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\\" Obama's first 100 days were highly anticipated after he became the apparent presumptive nominee. In his first 60 Minutes post-election interview Obama said that he had been studying Roosevelt's first 100 days. Understanding the significance and symbolism of the first 100 days, Hillary Clinton's campaign strategy included mapping out a first 100 days plan. While Barack Obama began preparation for his first 100 days during the presidential transition following his election, he stated that America only has one president at a time, especially for issues related to international affairs. During the first hundred days in office presidents are highly scrutinised and heading into the period Obama's intention was to attempt to execute several plans that are going to be watched closely. Media coverage Despite his attempt to downplay its significance, Obama's first 100 days were highly anticipated ever since he became the presumptive nominee. Several news outlets, such as Fox News and CBS News, even created special portals dedicated to covering the subject.Examples of \\"100 days\\"‚Äìportals:  * Commentators particularly weighed in on challenges and priorities within the fields of domestic and foreign policy, on economic issues, and on the environment. CNN listed a number of economic issues which \\"Obama and his team [would] have to tackle in their first 100 days\\", foremost among which was implementing a recovery package to deal with the then-ongoing financial crisis. Even MSNBC.com, which didn't use portals, acknowledged the notability of Obama's first 100 days by including it in the titles of its stories. On Obama's first day in office, BBC World Service released the results of an opinion poll of more than 17,000 people in 17 countries; it showed that 67% anticipated Obama would strengthen U.S. relations abroad, and 80% of Italians and Germans believed U.S. relations with the rest of the world would improve under Obama. Clive Stafford Smith, a British human rights lawyer, expressed hopes that Obama would close Guantanamo Bay detention camp within the time period. In addition, there were speculations in Jakarta that he might return to his former home city within the first 100 days after presidential aides announced his intention to hold a major foreign policy speech in the capital of an Islamic country. The New York Times devoted a five-day series, which was spread out over two weeks, to anticipatory analysis of Obama's first hundred days. Each day a political expert's analysis was followed by freely edited blog postings from readers. The writers compared Obama's prospects with the situations of Franklin D. Roosevelt (January 16 and February 2, Jean Edward Smith), John F. Kennedy (January 19 and February 10, Richard Reeves), Lyndon B. Johnson (January 23, Robert Dallek), Ronald Reagan (January 27, Lou Cannon), and Richard Nixon (February 4, Roger Morris). Even political advocacy groups such as Amnesty International planned special strategies to leverage the strategic and political significance of the first 100 days; the group organized a 100 Days Campaign for human rights. Inauguration The first 100 days of the Presidency of Barack Obama began during the inauguration of Barack Obama with the conversion of Whitehouse.gov from the Bush Administration version to the Obama Administration version at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2009. This was only the second presidential online portal transition. At 12:01, White House Director of New Media Macon Phillips posted the website's first blog post with themes of \\"communication\\", \\"transparency\\" and \\"participation\\". =Oath of Office= Obama retaking the oath of office on January 21, 2009 Article 2, Section 1, Clause 8 of the Constitution states: \\"Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:\\" Then, Article Two of the United States Constitution sets out the language that should be used in the Oath of office of the President of the United States: \\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\" The Vice President also has an oath of office, but it is not mandated by the Constitution and is prescribed by statute. During the inauguration, there were two matters of controversy. First, although Obama constitutionally assumed the Presidency at noon on January 20, he did not complete the oath of office until 12:05 pm. Clinton also completed the oath about five minutes late during his first inauguration. Additionally, Obama and the administering official, Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts, did not execute the 35-word oath as prescribed by the United States Constitution. First, Obama jumped in before the \\"do solemnly swear\\" phrase, which seemed to throw the Chief Justice off his stride. Subsequently, Roberts moved the word \\"faithfully\\" back nine spots, and used \\"to\\" instead of \\"of.\\" That threw the president off, and he smiled and paused to collect his thoughts, then decided to follow Roberts' lead. The flaw is recorded in the transcript of the oath as follows: :Roberts: I, Barack Hussein Obama ‚Ä¶ :Obama: I, Barack ‚Ä¶ :Roberts: ‚Ä¶ do solemnly swear ‚Ä¶ :Obama: I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear ‚Ä¶ :Roberts: ‚Ä¶ that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully ‚Ä¶ :Obama: ‚Ä¶ that I will execute ‚Ä¶ :Roberts: ‚Ä¶ the off ‚Äì faithfully the pres ‚Äì the office of president of the United States ‚Ä¶ :Obama (at the same time): ‚Ä¶ the office of president of the United States faithfully ‚Ä¶ According to the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Section 1: \\"The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January\\". Thus, Bush had relinquished the Presidency at 12:00. According to the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Section 3: If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President,... if the President elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified.\\" By Article Two, Section 1, Clause 8 of the Constitution and Amendment 20, Some feel that Obama was not able to assume the Presidency until 12:05. In fact, since Biden did not complete his oath until 12:01, there was further speculation as to who was President for the first minute after Bush relinquished control. Several political and constitutional law experts questioned whether Obama was officially the president since he had not correctly performed the constitutional duty of the Oath. The following day at about 7:35 pm the White House, Roberts re-administered the oath in an act that White House Counsel Greg Craig described as stemming from \\"an abundance of caution,\\" to quell any concerns that the President may not have been properly sworn in. Both Calvin Coolidge and Chester Arthur retook the oath under similar circumstances. Administration and Cabinet Twenty-two members of the Obama administration are either in the United States Cabinet (15) or are in positions considered to be Cabinet-level (7) and must be confirmed by the current Senate. The members of the Cabinet are the heads of the fifteen major departments (State, Defense, Justice, etc.), and the seven cabinet-level positions are the Vice President, White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador to the United Nations, and Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Since Robert Gates was a member of the previous administration, his letter of resignation (a formality at the end of a President's term) was simply not accepted, and he did not need confirmation. On January 19, 2009, Senate Democratic leaders requested fifteen of the twenty-two positions to be ratified by unanimous consent, and seven gained unanimous confirmation by voice vote the next day: Ken Salazar, Steven Chu, Arne Duncan, Peter Orszag, Eric Shinseki, Tom Vilsack, and Janet Napolitano. On January 21, Obama presided over the swearing in of the seven unanimous nominees. Later that day, the Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton by a 94‚Äì2 vote. On January 22, several more confirmations were approved unanimously: Susan E. Rice, Ray LaHood, Lisa P. Jackson, and Shaun Donovan. On January 26, the Senate confirmed Timothy Geithner by a 60‚Äì34 margin, and Holder was confirmed on February 2 by a 75‚Äì21 margin. Of the 31 nominations that Obama has made to senior posts only 17 were approved in January. At the conclusion of Obama's first week as President, Hilda Solis, Tom Daschle, Ron Kirk, and Eric Holder had yet to be confirmed, and there had been no second appointment for Secretary of Commerce. Republicans were also delaying Solis's confirmation due to a perceived lack of transparency. Holder was later confirmed by a vote of 75‚Äì21 on February 2,Senate confirms Holder as first black AG and on February 3, Obama announced Senator Judd Gregg as his second nomination for Secretary of Commerce, since Bill Richardson had withdrawn amid a grand jury investigation into a state contract awarded to his political donors. Daschle withdrew later that day amid controversy over his failure to pay income taxes and potential conflicts of interest related to the speaking fees he accepted from health care interests.Daschle withdraws as nominee for HHS secretary On February 12, Judd Gregg withdrew his nomination as Secretary of Commerce, citing \\"irresolvable conflicts\\" with President Obama and his staff over how to conduct the 2010 census and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.Gregg withdraws nomination to become commerce secy On February 24, Solis was confirmed by an 80‚Äì17 vote. The same day rumours abounded that former Democratic two-term Washington governor Gary Locke would be named as the third Obama Commerce Secretary nominee. Locke was formally nominated on February 26,Former Gov. Gary Locke nominated for Commerce secretary and was confirmed on March 24 by voice vote. On March 2, Obama introduced Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius as his second choice for Secretary of Health and Human Services. He also introduced Nancy-Ann DeParle as head of the new White House Office of Health Reform, which he suggested would work closely with the Department of Health and Human Services.CQ Transcript: President Obama Announces Nomination of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to Head HHS Ron Kirk was confirmed on March 18 by a 92‚Äì5 vote in the Senate.,Former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk confirmed as US trade representative and by the end of March, Sebelius was the only remaining Cabinet member yet to be confirmed. By comparison, Bill Clinton only had one outstanding Cabinet confirmation at the end of his first day in office and George W. Bush had all but one approved before February 1, 2001. Ronald Reagan had twelve of thirteen Cabinet members confirmed before February 1, and Jimmy Carter had all eleven of his confirmed. George H. W. Bush only had seven of thirteen confirmed by this time. Whereas his predecessors had to trade favours for contentious approvals such as Zoe Baird (Clinton), John Tower (G.H.W. Bush), or John Ashcroft (G.W. Bush), Obama has largely focused on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a proposed economic stimulus package totalling nearly $1 trillion. =Cabinet nominations= During the presidential transition between the election and the inauguration, Obama named Bill Richardson to be his Commerce Secretary. Richardson withdrew his nomination on January 5 because of scrutiny regarding a pay to play scandal in which he was being investigated because his donors curiously received a lucrative transportation contract. On February 3, Obama announced the nomination of Republican Judd Gregg in his place. Tom Daschle was Obama's original nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary. However, he owed over $128,000 in taxes over three years, failed to report more than $83,000 in consulting fees in 2007, and owed $12,000 in interest and penalties. He also provided insufficient documentation for $15,000 of the $276,000 in charitable contributions that he and his wife, Linda, gave during the three-year period being studied by the panel. Daschle also had some miscommunications with his accountant on the $255,000 use of a luxury car service that was used 80% for personal services. Daschle paid his back taxes six days before his first confirmation hearings with the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. On February 3, The New York Times called the Daschle nomination into question both for his tax issues and for his extensive private sector work in the health services industry. The editorial noted that although Daschle was aware of his tax problem in June 2008, he did not correct it until his cabinet nomination. Later that day, Daschle withdrew his nomination. Though Hillary Clinton was ultimately confirmed on January 21 by a 95‚Äì2 vote, with David Vitter (R-Louisiana) and Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) in dissent, Senate Republicans slowed the process due to objections over the charitable activities of Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton. John Cornyn (R-Texas) held up proceedings for a day to discuss this matter. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana), the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, expressed an interest in President Bill Clinton's foundation reject foreign contributions to avoid possible conflict of interest. Sen. Clinton contended that the foundation's disclosure plans already exceeded legal requirements. Timothy Geithner, who was nominated as Treasury Secretary, also encountered tax issues.Obama's promise of ethics reform faces early test, International Herald Tribune, February 3, 2009 He apologised to the United States Senate Committee on Finance for having overlooked paying $34,000 in Social Security and Medicare taxes earlier this decade. The committee endorsed Geithner by an 18‚Äì5 margin with half of the ten Republicans opposing the nomination. He was confirmed despite failure to pay a total of $43,000 in taxes and penalties, which troubled the Senate. Holder was endorsed by the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary by a 17‚Äì2 margin on January 28. Dissent on his confirmation centred on his support for some of Bill Clinton's controversial pardons and commutations of sentence. Republican Cornyn had sought a pledge from Holder that he would not prosecute intelligence agents who participated in harsh interrogations, but Holder, who if confirmed will have to review Justice Department officials who may have violated the law for possible prosecution, refused to give such a pledge. Obama had nominated Nancy Killefer for the position of Chief Performance Officer, but Killefer withdrew on February 3 after it was revealed that she had failed to pay the unemployment compensation tax for a household employee for a period of 18 months. The vote on Hilda Solis for Secretary of Labor had originally been scheduled for February 5, but she faced delayed confirmation hearings due to her pro-labor activities as a board member of American Rights at Work and because of $6,400 in unpaid tax liens against her husband's auto repair business.Tax problems delay vote on Hilda Solis, UPI Online, February 5, 2009 Both Solis, who was uninvolved in the business, and her husband claimed not to have had any knowledge of the 16-year-old liens prior to their disclosure by a newspaper, and they paid it when notified. Delays were however exacerbated due to Solis' perceived unresponsiveness to questions. On February 11, the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions voted by voice vote to endorse Hilda Solis as the Labor Secretary, with the only dissenting members of the 22-person committee Republicans Tom Coburn and Pat Roberts. Solis was later confirmed on February 24.political ticker On February 12, Senator Judd Gregg withdrew his name from consideration as United States Commerce Secretary. Judd cited policy differences between himself and the Obama administration as his primary reasons and noted that unlike earlier withdrawals he was not having difficulties with the vetting process. He had reservations about the stimulus package and about the changes being made in the United States Census Bureau as his primary concerns. Gregg has a track record of opposing funding for the Census, that is highlighted by his tenure as the Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Budget. The Congressional Black Caucus and National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials both expressed disappointment at Gregg's nomination because the United States Department of Commerce oversees the Census. The White House subsequently said it take control of the 2010 United States Census, but then backpedaled saying that they would \\"work closely\\" with the United States Census Director. Republicans were alarmed by the foreshadowing of \\"backroom deals\\" by the White House and Rahm Emanuel. While pundits puzzled over U.S. Trade Representative-designate Ron Kirk's failure to be confirmed by March 2009, it was reported on March 2 that Kirk owed over $10,000 in back taxes. Kirk agreed to pay them in exchange for Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus's aid in speeding up the confirmation process;Trade nominee Ron Kirk agrees to pay back taxes he was later confirmed on March 18. On March 31, Kathleen Sebelius, Obama's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, revealed in a letter to the Senate Finance Committee that her Certified Public Accountant found errors in her tax returns for years 2005‚Äì2007. She, along with her husband, paid more than $7,000 in back taxes, along with $878 in interest.Another Obama Nominee Has Tax Issues, CBS News, March 31, 2009 =Notable non-Cabinet positions= Appointees serve at the pleasure of the President and were nominated by Barack Obama except as noted. * Sheila Bair, Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation1 * Retired Admiral Dennis C.

Bush in 2006 to a five-year term 2Appointed by George W. Bush in 2001 to a ten-year term Policy One of the first acts by the Obama administration after assuming control was an order signed by Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel that suspended all pending federal regulations proposed by outgoing President George W. Bush so that they could be reviewed. This was comparable to prior moves by the Bush Administration upon assuming control from Bill Clinton, who in his final 20 days in office issued 12 executive orders. Due to the economic crisis, the President enacted a pay freeze for senior White House staff making more than $100,000 per year. The action affected approximately 120 staffers and added up to about a $443,000 savings for the United States government. Obama also announced stricter guidelines regarding lobbyists in an effort to raise the ethical standards of the White House. The new policy bans aides from attempting to influence the administration for at least two years if they leave his staff. It also bans aides on staff from working on matters they have previously lobbied on, or to approach agencies that they targeted while on staff. Their ban also included a gift-giving ban. However, one day later he nominated William J. Lynn III, a lobbyist for defence contractor Raytheon, for the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense.Obama Nominee Runs Into New Lobby Rules, Washington Post, January 23, 2009 Obama later nominated William Corr, an anti-tobacco lobbyist, for Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services. In his first week in office, President Obama signed an executive order suspending all the ongoing proceedings of Guantanamo military commission and ordering that the detention facility would be shut down within the year. He also signed an order requiring the Army Field Manual to be used as guide for terror interrogations, banning torture and other illegal coercive techniques, such as waterboarding.Obama Reverses Key Bush Security Policies, The New York Times, January 22, 2009 Obama also issued an executive order entitled \\"Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel,\\" setting stricter limitations on incoming executive branch employees and placing tighter restrictions on lobbying in the White House. Obama signed two Presidential Memoranda concerning energy independence, ordering the Department of Transportation to establish higher fuel efficiency standards before 2011 models are released and allowing states to raise their emissions standards above the national standard. He also ended the Mexico City Policy, which banned funds to international groups that provide abortion services or counselling.Obama reverses Bush abortion-funds policy January 23, 2009 In his first week he also established a policy of producing a weekly Saturday morning video address available on Whitehouse.gov and YouTube, much like those released during his transition period. The first address had been viewed by 600,000 YouTube viewers by the next afternoon. The policy is likened to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats and George W. Bush's weekly radio addresses. The first piece of legislation signed by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act on January 29, which promoted fair pay regardless of gender, race, or age. Lilly Ledbetter joined Obama and his wife, Michelle, as he signed the bill, fulfilling his campaign pledge to nullify Ledbetter v. Goodyear. On February 18, 2009, Obama announced that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be bolstered by 17,000 new troops by summer. The announcement followed the recommendation of several experts including Defense Secretary Robert Gates that additional troops be deployed to the strife-torn South Asian country. Nine days after his speech on Afghanistan, Obama addressed Marines at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and outlined an exit strategy for the Iraq War. Obama promised to withdraw all combat troops from Iraq by August 31, 2010, and a \\"transitional force\\" of up to 50,000 counterterrorism, advisory, training, and support personnel by the end of 2011. On March 10, 2009, Barack Obama, in a meeting with the New Democrat Coalition, told them that he was a \\"New Democrat\\", \\"pro-growth Democrat\\", \\"supports free and fair trade\\", and \\"very concerned about a return to protectionism.\\"Obama: 'I am a New Democrat' On April 5, 2009, Barack Obama promoted the goal of a nuclear-free world.Obama promotes nuclear-free world April 5, 2009 =Policy review= The stimulus package passed in the House of Representatives on January 28 without a single Republican vote. The Republicans developed opposition without developing consensus on an alternative plan. Conservatives who have been supportive of Obama have come out against the plan. The Wall Street Journal has questioned whether the $825 billion package is well designed. However, Duncan notes that one of the largest components, $140 billion earmarked for education, is well spent. Christopher Dodd is credited with inserting the last-minute pay limit into American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The pay restrictions included prohibition of bonuses in excess of one-third of total salary for any company receiving any money from the plan and was retroactive to companies that received funds under Troubled Assets Relief Program. The limit was a significant alteration of the administration's plan and caught Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Chairman Lawrence Summers by surprise. After Obama announced deadlines for the phased withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Iraq, Congress broadly endorsed the president's plan and agreed to legislate the stated timetables, though some in the Democratic Party balked at the 50,000-head figure for the transitional force and many in the Republican Party criticised the deadlines' rigidity. Arizona Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in the 2008 election, voiced support for his former rival's plan. Other notable events Barack Obama preparing for his weekly address On March 19, Obama became the first sitting president to appear on a late night talk show when he was a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.The Associated Press: Maria Shriver: Obama Special Olympics 'joke' hurts On April 2, Obama attended the G-20 London Summit. On April 17‚Äì19 he attended the 5th Summit of the Americas where he met Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a longtime enemy of Washington, who shook his hand and gave him the book Las venas abiertas de Am√©rica Latina (Open Veins of Latin America) of Eduardo Galeano while media was present. On April 28, day 99 of Obama's presidency, Senator Arlen Specter (a former Democrat who switched to the Republican party in 1966) returned to the Democratic Party. Specter increased the Democratic senators to 59, one short of a filibuster- proof majority. At the conclusion of the first 100 days, over 100 federal judgeships remained vacant.

The FCP requires provincially regulated employers with 100 or more employees bidding on federal contracts of $1,000,000 (originally $200,000) or more to certify that they will implement employment equity measures. The FCP was created by a 1986 decision of the federal cabinet, not through legislation. Because the FCP is occasionally confused with the provisions of the Canadian Employment Equity Act, the latter is often referred to as Legislated Employment Equity to distinguish it from the FCP. The FCP is limited to provincially regulated suppliers to the federal government (with the above-described limits). In contrast, the Canadian Employment Equity Act covers only federally regulated organizations such as railways, airlines, telecommunication firms, banks, etc., regardless of whether they are suppliers to the federal government. However, there are parallels between the two programs. Both FCP and Legislated Employment Equity mandate proactive treatment by employers to increase the representation of four specified groups in the workforce: Women, visible minorities, aboriginal peoples, and people with disabilities.

It was the first GT prototype race car to incorporate ground-effect tunnels for downforce. The revolutionary aerodynamic design of the T600 was widely imitated throughout the 1980s by International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) and Group C prototype cars. The Lola T600 ran initially in the U.S.-based IMSA GT series and later in European Group C races. A total of 12 chassis were built.  Development  At the end of the 1980 season, it seemed that the Porsche 935 Turbo would continue to dominate the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) Championship. Fearing that fans would lose interest in a series dominated by a single marque, IMSA officials announced the new Grand Touring Prototype category. The GTP category was also consistent with the FIA's plan to introduce a prototype formula to the World Endurance Championship in 1982 (Group C), superseding production-based \\"silhouette\\" cars like the Porsche 935. Brian Redman asked for Lola Cars to develop a GTP spec racer based on a T70 chassis, fitted with a new bodywork and a Chevy 6.0L V8 engine developing around 600 bhp. Lola's Eric Broadley, however, wanted a new chassis and bodywork developed specifically for the new IMSA GTP regulations. He hired aerodynamicist Max Sardou to design a ground effects underbody for the car. Cooke-Woods Racing were the first customer and also helped develop the car.  Racing History  = IMSA Championship = ;1981 Cooke-Woods Racing entered chassis #HU01 for the fifth race of 1981 season, at Laguna Seca, with Redman driving. The team achieved victory in its debut race, followed by wins at Lime Rock, Mid Ohio, Portland and Road Atlanta. The car proved extremely reliable, winning the IMSA title and knocking Porsche from the top of the championship standings for the first time since 1977. Lola Cars sold 11 additional T600s on the strength of this performance. Among the drivers fielding T600s were Chris Cord and John Paul Jr. (chassis #HU04 and #HU05), though neither achieved the success of Cooke-Woods effort. ;1982 Cooke-Woods Racing became Cooke Racing after Roy Woods and Redman left the team and never again approached its dominant form of 1981. J.L.P. Racing and Cord Racing returned, while additional Lolas from Interscope appeared in the grid, raced by Danny Ongais, Ted Field and Bill Whittington. Interscope won four races but John Paul Jr. took the Championship driving both a T600 and Porsche 935s, scoring one of his seven victories in the Lola. Field finished second in standings.1982 IMSA Season ;1983 Ted Field fitted a 700 hp Chevrolet V6 3.4L turbo engine in one of the Interscope T600s, which proved to be a fast but unreliable combination. Other Lolas fielded by John Kalagian and Conte Racing employed the ubiquitous Chevy V8, while Bayside Racing installed a Porsche 935 turbo engine in their T600.

Published every Wednesday, it holds a mirror to the world of the Highway 35 corridor from Norland to Dorset. Its editorial focus is the village of Minden as well as the municipalities of Minden Hills and Algonquin Highlands. History The Minden Times was first called the Minden Progress. The inaugural edition was published Wednesday, January 30, 1963 with the headline \\"It's carnival time!\\" The editorial by Editor Alan R. Capon said, that the newspaper's partners \\"felt that the County Town of the Haliburton Highlands needed such a publication as a voice and a forum for comment.... We don't intend to remain the same, issue after issue. Thirty years from now the current cars will look just as old fashioned as the high-behinds the Keystone Cops used ‚Äì little by little they adapt to the pressures of a changing world. We'll change too as the need arises because we feel that when you're through changing, you're through.\\" Not much is known about the paper's early years. In 1979, Jack Brezina left his job as the editor of the Cochrane Northland Post to buy the newspaper, which was now called the Minden Times. He became much beloved by the people he wrote about and soon was part of all aspects of community life. He served on various health boards and theatre groups, acting as emcee for numerous events. One of his strongest memories is of the paper lead the campaign against was he calls \\"the skinhead invasion\\" in Minden 1989. The gathering at a rural property north of the village garnered national attention and the Minden Times made sure everyone knew the community did not tolerate the views espoused by the skinheads and neo-Nazis. In November 2001, Brezina sold the Times to Len Pizzey, who had arrived in the Highlands at approximately the same time to work at the competing newspaper, The Haliburton County Echo, 24 kilometres away. Pizzey had bought the Echo in the mid-1980s and when he bought the Times in 2001, merged the two staffs, while keeping separate offices and identities for the papers. Pizzey sold the Times and the Echo to Osprey Media Group in August 2004 and stayed on as group publisher until his own retirement in November 2005. David Zilstra was appointed general manager of the two papers, as well as Bancroft This Week and Barry's Bay This Week. In January 2010, Zilstra moved on to Barrie taking the helm of the Barrie Examiner, being replaced by John Bauman as general manager. After a brief and ill-fated merger with a local competitor under the name Maple Key Media in early 2014, the Times and its sister paper, the Haliburton County Echo, became part of White Pine Media, a subsidiary of London Publishing.

In 1293, Jadwiga married W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. Life Jadwiga's husband, W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, was a bitter rival of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia who was King of Poland between 1291‚Äì1305. Life was dangerous for Jadwiga and her family during this time, she and three of her children had to go into hiding for a while in 1300. In 1305, Wenceslaus II died and was succeeded by his son, Wenceslaus III of Bohemia. Wenceslaus III reigned for a year before he was assassinated by Germans under mysterious circumstances so his campaign of Poland ended. His wife, Viola of Teschen, had not borne him any children, so W≈Çadys≈Çaw assumed control in Poland. In 1318, W≈Çadys≈Çaw began making attempts to have himself crowned king. The pope, though initially unwilling, finally granted his approval and W≈Çadys≈Çaw and Jadwiga were crowned King and Queen of Poland on 30 January 1320 in Krak√≥w; a new crown was made for the new queen and it was later used to crown other queens of Poland.

In 1975, he was the first Inuk printmaker to have a collection of his own prints released. He is now an Elder. Early years Etok was born in the camp of Qirnituartuq, near the community of Kangiqsualujjuaq, Quebec, Canada. His mother was Sarah, and he has a brother, Joe Willie. The family originated from the Tasiujaq region, later moving to the areas of Nachvak fiord in Labrador's Torngat Mountains, and the Koroc River area of Quebec's Ungava Bay watershed. Career Using sticks, Etok began drawing as a child. His early drawings were of animals and villages, while his later work consisted of supernatural beings and illustrations of legends. After attending a print workshop in Puvirnituq, he learned how to earn money as a printmaker in the 1970s. In 1967, he befriended anthropologist Donat Savoie who stayed with Etok and family while doing research for his masters thesis. The household included Etok, Sarah, and Joe, as well as Etok's wife, Susie (n√©e Baron; 1939‚Äì2006) of Koroc River, and children, Minnie, Tomasi, Aatami, and Charlie. Etok and Savoie's friendship has lasted through the years, even after Savoie became a government official. Later years Now considered an Inuk Elder, a trilingual (Inuktitut, English and French) biography of Etok's life was written by Jobie Weetaluktuk, and published in Nunavik in 2008.

All For NC: ZSR‚Äôs Framework for Grantmaking and Learning builds from the strategies of the Foundation's emerging direction and aligns with its mission and core values to: * Support a network of organizations that are working to affect change through a State-Level Systemic Change Strategy; * Create more connections between people, places, organizations and sectors who are working to impact the communities in which they live through a Community-Based Strategy; and * Remain open to bold, unconventional or higher-risk ideas that have transformative potential through an Exploratory, Visionary Ideas Strategy. Alongside these three main strategies, the Foundation also has expressed its commitment to: * Augment its participation in its hometown of Winston- Salem/Forsyth County, * Use a racial equity lens to underpin all of its work, and * Continue to be a learning organization. The intent of the Foundation's Framework for Grantmaking and Learning is to provide different strategies that meet people and communities where they are, as well as to break down the silos of traditional focus areas, allow more flexibility in grantmaking, and provide multiple entry points for potential applicants.

Admired for her spontaneity, expressiveness, and clear diction, she was considered one of the greatest interpreters of 20th century Catalan, Spanish and Latin American art song.Sadie (1988) p. 49 She premiered many works in that genre, including those by Enrique Granados, Manuel de Falla, Frederic Mompou, Alberto Ginastera, and Enric Morera, several of which had been specially written for her voice. The main part of the collection of Badia's sound recordings, scores, letters and pictures is preserved in the Biblioteca de Catalunya. In one of the letters, Pablo Casals wrote: \\"Everything I've written for a soprano voice has been thinking about you. Therefore, every one is yours.\\" Life and career Conxita Badia was born Concepci√≥ Badia i Mill√†s in Barcelona on 14 November 1897 and studied under Enrique Granados, Manuel de Falla and Pablo Casals. She had initially enrolled in the Granados Academy as a piano student, but Granados 'discovered' her voice during a solf√®ge examination.Clark (2006) p. 175 Her first appearance on the stage was as one of the six flower maidens in a performance of Wagner's Parsifal at the Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana in 1913 when she was only 16 years old. Her solo recital debut came on 5 April 1915 in the premiere performance of the Granados song cycle, Canciones Amatorias, accompanied by the composer (two of the songs, \\"Llorad coraz√≥n\\" and \\"Gracia m√≠a\\", were dedicated to her by Granados).Clark (2006) p. 147. Following the death of Granados and his wife in the 1916 sinking of the , she performed in numerous concerts in his memory across Spain and Europe. In 1935, she made only other appearance on the opera stage: to sing the title role in Mar√≠a del Carmen.Hess (1991). pp. 23 and 67 It was the first time the work had been revived since its initial performances in 1898-1899. During the 1930s she gave many recitals and concerts in Spain and in the rest of Europe. From 1936 to 1938, due to the Spanish Civil War, she performed more extensively in Europe in cities including London, Brussels, Geneva, Paris, Vienna, and Salzburg. In Vienna, she sang Roberto Gerhard's Sis can√ßons populars catalanes in their 1932 premiere conducted by Anton Webern.Kent Gerhard had also dedicated his early song cycle L'infantament meravell√≥s de Shahrazada (1916‚Äì18) to Badia and later said of her: > \\"She feels such an intense joy when she sings - joy in the music, joy in her > own voice - that it is impossible not to share it when you listen to > her.\\"Original Spanish: \\"Bad√≠a o la alegr√≠a, porque ella siente al cantar una > alegr√≠a tan intensa - alegr√≠a de la m√∫sica, alegr√≠a de su propia voz - que > es imposible no participar de ella al escucharla.\\" quoted in Tarazona (1996) Badia had married Ricard Agust√≠ Montsech in 1919. The couple has three daughters: Conxita, Mariona, and Carme. In 1936 Badia and her daughters left Spain to escape the Spanish Civil War, while her husband was working in South America. They initially lived in Paris and then in Rio de Janeiro before moving to Argentina where her husband joined them in 1938. In Argentina she continued her close artistic partnership with her fellow exile, Manuel de Falla. She also collaborated closely with the Argentine composers Juan Jose Castro, Carlos Guastavino and Alberto Ginastera, the poet Rafael Alberti, and the Brazilian Heitor Villa-Lobos, among many others. In 1946, she and her family returned to Catalonia, where she introduced many of their songs to Spanish and European audiences, often with her close friend Alicia de Larrocha. After her return to Catalonia, Badia also taught singing and piano, both privately and in her later years as a professor at Barcelona's Municipal Conservatory of Barcelona. Amongst her pupils were the pianist Joaqu√≠n Nin- Culmell and the soprano Montserrat Caball√©. She also served on the juries of international singing competitions in South America and Europe, including the Rio de Janeiro International Song Competition, the Mozarteum in Salzburg, and the Francesc Vi√±as competition in Barcelona. Conxita Badia died in Barcelona on 2 May 1975. In 1997, the Archivo Manuel de Falla and the University of Granada marked the centenary of her birth with an exhibition and a series of concerts in her honour.

A traditional police and security institution, the Zangbeto cult is charged with the maintenance of law and order, and ensures safety and security within Ogu communities. They are highly revered and act as an unofficial police force patrolling the streets, especially in the night, watching over people and their properties, and tracking down criminals and presenting them to the community to punish. Originally created to scare the enemy away, Zangbeto will wander the streets to detect thieves and witches, and to protect law and order. Description Relating its fundamental cultural role in local vigilantism and community policing in Ogu societies, Zangbeto is a term in Gun language which means \\"Men of the night\\" or \\"Night-watchmen\\". The Zangbeto takes on a covering made from an intricate mass of tiny strands of hay, raffia or other threadlike materials, which are sometimes dyed in very colourful hues. They are able to fall into a trance which, according to tradition, enables their bodies to be inhabited by spirits who possess special knowledge of the actions of people. However, Ogu legend tells that there are no humans under the costume, only spirits of the night. In Ogu culture, the Zangbetos are the traditional security guards or policemen of their communities. They are said to form a secret society which can only be strictly attended by Zangbeto or voodoo worshipers and devotees. Zangbeto is deemed to have spiritistic and magical abilities, such as swallowing splinters of glass without coming to any harm and scaring away even witches.. In a trance, the Zangbeto are said to evoke a power that inhabited the earth long before the appearance of man and provide a source of wisdom and continuity for the Ogu people. Elaborate festivals built around the Zangbeto are held regularly in different Ogu communities across West Africa. The popular ones are those that hold in Porto-Novo, Benin Republic and in Ajido, Lagos, Nigeria. These festivals comprise colourful displays, electrifying performances and magic.

Alberta Farmer, Johnnie Bachusky. At one time, the row had at least seven elevators. History and significance Alberta Farmers Co- operative elevator, built in 1913 before Alberta Wheat Pool takeover (photo circa 1920) Many once-common wood-crib grain elevators in Western Canada have been torn down. Warner has four elevators, and the Inglis elevator row in Manitoba has five. Warner's elevators are not protected.\\"Progress is leaving Alberta's historic grain elevators in its wake\\". National Post, Jen Gerson April 7, 2013. In 2014, two of the elevators were demolished. Before 1911, Warner had two elevators: one a house built by the Alberta Pacific Elevator Company, and the other a elevator built by Jones and Dill. In 1913, the first elevator in the remaining group was built by the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company.\\"LONGEST - Remaining Row of Grain Elevators in Alberta\\". Waymarking. The structure and history of each elevator was influenced by developments in the grain industry and its companies from before World War II to the 1980s. The Warner elevators date from 1913 to 1960. The row included an early example of the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company design and examples of complex component arrangements: elevator and twin, elevator and annexes and original and replacement offices. The 1939 elevator built by the Ellison Milling and Elevator Company is an architecturally-significant example of an essentially-unchanged 1940s complex consisting of an elevator, two balloon annexes and a track-side office and warehouse (usually from an earlier period). A small number of late-1930s elevators remain in Alberta, a reminder that few were built for some time after 1934. This elevator was demolished in the early 2000s. The Warner elevator row is included in Jim Pearson's book, Grain Elevators of Eastern Saskatchewan.\\"Photos: Grain elevators of eastern Saskatchewan\\". Leader-Post. January 27, 2014 Grain elevators With the exception of the United Grain Growers elevator, Warner's elevators were little-modified and several have small scales and air dumps on site. The first elevator was built in 1911, when the Canadian Pacific Railway reached Warner. =Demolitions= From 1999 to 2014, 5 elevators were demolished, bringing the total elevator count down to 4. =History= United Grain Growers elevator, built in 1960 The United Grain Growers elevator and annex were built between 1957 and 1960, and the complex was licensed for in 1960. It was UGG's second elevator at Warner; the first was sold to Alberta Pool Elevators in 1928. The elevator was upgraded during the late 1980s, including the installation of a new leg which required raising part of the cupola; the metal bin annexes on the south side and drag auger date from that time. A cyclone dust collector and truck-loading spout have been installed, and a roofed track-side warehouse on the north side was probably built at the same time as the elevator. A demolished 1950 elevator built by X. C. Hadford Company was licensed as a seed elevator in 1952. In 1992, it was licensed as a 240-tonne primary elevator. 1913 Alberta Farmers Co-operative elevator in early 2010 The , Alberta Farmers' Co-operative elevator was built in 1913. Before its demolition, it was one of the two oldest examples of standard Alberta Farmers' Elevator Company 1913‚Äì1917 design. It had a pyramidal roof, with a gable-roofed cupola housing the head of the leg. Archival photographs of other Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company facilities suggest that this elevator originally had a track-side office and warehouse next to the elevator. In 1913, the United Farmers of Alberta proposed the establishment of the Alberta Farmers' Elevator Company as a solution to producer problems in the province. Shares were issued to farmers at $60 each, payable in four annual installments. The Alberta government provided loans of 85 percent of the share sum. To market their grain and guarantee their loans during rapid wartime expansion, the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company relied on the experience of the Grain Growers Grain Company of Manitoba. In 1917 the companies merged to form the United Grain Growers, headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In 1928 the UGG sold their 1913 Warner elevator to the Alberta Pool Elevator Company. A coal shed associated with the elevator since 1926 was sold in 1940 and removed from the site. In 1940 a balloon annex, built by the F. W. McDougall Construction Company, was added to the elevator and later removed. In 1951, the elevator was twinned with a new , elevator built by the pool; a new driveway was also built at this time. Both elevators have been demolished. The 1928 Alberta Wheat Pool elevator was built by Voss Bros for the Alberta Pool Elevator Company in accordance with the standard plan at a cost of $15,300. It measured ; a balloon annex built on the south side in 1940 was removed in 1995. The elevator has been demolished. A elevator was built in 1918 by the Alberta Pacific Grain Company, replacing a pre-1911 Alberta Pacific Elevator Company structure. It may have had an annex, since it was licensed in 1918 for and for in 1922. In 1953 a annex (removed in 1997) was attached to the elevator's north side, and a second annex was added six years later. In 1967, the elevator was taken over by Federal Grain; the following year Federal built a new elevator, twinning it with the 1918 structure and moving the 1959 annex to the south side of the new elevator. A driveway the length of both elevators was also built at this time. In 1972 the complex was sold to Alberta Wheat Pool, and in the summer of 1997 it was the AWP No. 4 house. 1918 Alberta Pacific elevator (right) and 1968 Federal Grain elevator The 1968 Federal Grain elevator measures , with an electronic scale and an exterior loading spout for trucks. It was among the last elevators built according to the traditional design, before the single composite design came into widespread use. A elevator was built by Ogilvie Flour Mills in 1929. A balloon annex was added in 1940, followed by a annex twelve years later. One annex was removed in 1997, and the elevator has been demolished. A elevator was built by the Ellison Milling and Flour Company in 1939, with annexes probably built during World War II as temporary storage. In 1974 it was sold to Parrish & Heimbecker, and to UGG in 1985. The elevator has been demolished.

HHLA Container Terminal Altenwerder CTA is almost completely automated. The shipping company Hapag-Lloyd owns a share of 25.1% in the terminal. Container Terminal Burchardkai is the largest and oldest surviving container handling facility at the Port of Hamburg. HHLA also owns a container terminal at the Port of Odessa. In June 2018, HHLA acquired the largest Estonian terminal operator Transiidikeskuse AS (headquartered in Muuga). At the time, the container terminal had a handling capacity of approximately 300,000 TEU.Terminalbetreiber in Estland gekauft. In: Schiff & Hafen, Heft 7/2018, p. 9. HHLA‚Äôs Container segment also includes a number of services related to container handling offered by its subsidiaries. = Intermodal = This segment covers container transport by rail and road. The sector includes the transport company Metrans and road transport company Container-Transport- Dienst (CTD). Metrans operates container trains from its own terminals in the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and neighbouring countries;Containerverkehr auf der Schiene wird neu geordnet. In: T√§glicher Hafenbericht, April 30, 2012, p. 1. CTD covers the area surrounding the Hamburg Metropolitan Region by road.

Institutionen und Profile, M√ºnster, Hamburg 2000, p. 264, . Its role included organising transloading for the city and the maintenance of both the wharfs and the equipment and machinery on them. In March 1885, the city founded the Hamburger Freihafen-Lagerhaus-Gesellschaft (HFLG). As part of Hamburg‚Äôs inclusion in the German Imperial customs system, the company‚Äôs role was to build and maintain the world‚Äôs most modern and largest logistics centre at that time ‚Äì Hamburg‚Äôs Speicherstadt historical warehouse district.Helmuth Kern: Die Hamburger Hafen- und Lagerhaus-Aktiengesellschaft: Portr√§t eines landeseigenen Unternehmens im freien Wettbewerb. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr √∂ffentliche und gemeinwirtschaftliche Unternehmen, Bd. 6, H. 2 (1983), p. 163‚Äì168, here p. 164. It was an Aktiengesellschaft from the very beginning, with the city contributing the property and Norddeutsche Bank the capital. Construction of the Speicherstadt warehouse district began in 1885 and was largely completed by 1912. By 1913, the Port of Hamburg was the third-largest in the world behind the ports of London and New York. During World War I (1914‚Äì1918), the Royal Navy blocked the seaports of the German Reich. This brought business in Hamburg and its port to a complete standstill. In the Treaty of Versailles, the allied powers forced Germany to give up the majority of its merchant navy. Companies such as HAPAG were, however, able to retool in the coming years. In 1927, the City of Hamburg became the sole shareholder in HFLG.Arnold Kludas, Dieter Maass, Susanne Sabisch: Hafen Hamburg. Die Geschichte des Hamburger Freihafens von den Anf√§ngen bis zur Gegenwart. Kabel, Hamburg 1988, p. 50, . The effects of the Great Depression (from 1929), protectionism in many industrial countries, the seizure of control by the National Socialists (1933) and their autarky policy saw cross border trade drop to levels lower than before the crisis. In 1935, HFLG merged with the state quay administration to become the Betriebsgesellschaft der hamburgischen Hafenanlagen. As well as operating the port facilities, it was also responsible for their upkeep and expansion. In 1939, the company was renamed, becoming Hamburger Hafen- und Lagerhaus-Aktiengesellschaft (HHLA). During World War II, HHLA employed forced labour. Allied bombers attacked the Port of Hamburg multiple times, destroying large parts of it. = 1945‚Äì2007 = The Second World War ended in May 1945. The Port of Hamburg had suffered further damage. Around 90% of the quay shed area was destroyed, and two thirds of the warehouses were left unusable. Large parts of the quay walls lay in ruins. Almost 3,000 shipwrecks prevented regulated shipping movements. The reconstruction of the port was largely completed by 1956. p. 77 f. 1967 saw the opening of the ‚Äú√úbersee-Zentrum‚Äù. It was, at the time, the world‚Äôs largest distribution shed and was used as a distribution facility for mixed break bulk cargo. It remained in use until 2016. The first container ship docked in the Port of Hamburg in 1968. It was handled at Burchardkai ‚Äì where HHLA later built the Container Terminal Burchardkai ‚Äì using container cranes. In 1970, new port order regulations relieved HHLA of all sovereign functions. This created competition between companies in the port industry. p. 38. In 1978, HHLA opened its new fruit and cooling centre for fruit and refrigerated goods, which has been modernised multiple times in the years since. In 1990, many of the former Eastern Bloc states became independent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Port of Hamburg was soon able to resume handling cargo for these countries (its Hinterland was now much larger). HHLA began to invest in a number of companies that organised container transport on the railway network, and the volume of cargo that they handled rose. p. 89 f. The first container ship was handled at the new Container Terminal Altenwerder (CTA) on 25 June 2002. On 1 October 2005, the company changed its name to Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG. The abbreviation HHLA remained. = Since 2007 = HHLA was retroactively split into the subgroups Port Logistics and Real Estate with effect from 1 January 2007. On 2 November 2007, the Port Logistics subgroup was listed on the stock exchange. Since its initial public offering, HHLA shares have been traded on the Prime Standard at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the Hamburg Stock Exchange.

Also, he has been called the Jerry Seinfeld of Arab-American culture after he was known for playing the role of Im Hussein in many plays just like, Shoufou alwawa wayn and the play Arab and Broud.\\"Bakri, Lama. \\"Plays Takes Jab at Newcomers,\\" The Detroit News, June 26, 1998: 3D Biography Born in Lebanon, Najee Mondalek grew up in a dreadful and unsecured environment where he spent much of his early childhood witnessing Lebanon's civil war. It was not until 1985, as a teenager of 19 years old, that he immigrated to the United States where he attended Macomb Community College, Wayne State University, and Academy of Art University. Thereafter, he returned to Michigan to work for GM (General Motors) as a virtual-reality engineer. Career In 1988 he founded the AJYAL Theatrical Group‚Äî the first Arab-American theatrical group to \\"take the show on the road\\" and perform for Arab-American audiences in The United States, Canada, Australia and the Middle East. The everyday lives of Arab-American, their mistakes and mishaps constitute the subject of Ajyal Theatrical Group' shows. Ajyal has been the one constant for Mondalek. He writes a new show nearly every year. In September 1994, his theatrical life underwent a transformation. The centerpiece of his creative life, Im Hussein has become his Dame Edna, starring in six hit comedic plays since \\"Smile You Are in America,\\" a comedy about immigrants trying to adjust to their new country. The main character was an older woman named Im Hussein. Three days before the first performance the father of the actress playing Im Hussein died. Mondalek couldn't find anyone to replace her. Thinking about Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire and Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, Mondalek took the part himself.

So many attempts were made to reschedule this show, but something always worked against it. his sister works at bridge. In the end, the group decided to wrap up this play, and the show was never performed. Five years later, on April 19, 1995 the group was scheduled to meet in the evening to discuss the possibility of performing this show again. That day, the federal building in Oklahoma city was bombed. The meeting was canceled, and no one in the group ever talked about this show again. =Honest Thieves= \\"Arabic ÿ≠ÿßŸÖŸäŸáÿß ÿ≠ÿ±ÿßŸÖŸäŸáÿß\\" \\"translit: 7ameeha 7arameeha\\" was performed in the fall of 1991.

History Thomas Fentiman, an iron puddler from Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, acquired a recipe for botanically brewed ginger beer in 1905 when a fellow tradesman approached Fentiman for a loan. The loan was never repaid so Thomas became the owner of the recipe. The firm became a door-to-door ginger beer sales company using a horse and cart for transport. His ginger beer was stored in handmade stone jars known as 'grey hens', all stamped with the Fentimans mascot based on Thomas' German Shepherd dog 'Fearless' who won the Crufts obedience class twice in 1933 and 1934. The botanically brewed ginger beer became popular quickly and the business grew, with several brewing and production facilities being opened in the North of England. The company fell on hard times as supermarkets entered the soft drinks market. As a result, sales of the Grey Hens (the stone jars in which ginger beer was sold) slumped and the company closed down in the mid 1960s. But in 1988, Thomas Fentiman's great grandson re-established the business with a mission to produce drinks in the original way, using the traditional ginger beer recipe and 100% natural ingredients. From then, with old-style products and vintage goods becoming more popular, Fentimans has enjoyed a wave of popularity. Since 1905, Fentimans has been brewing botanical sodas with ingredients including roots, bark and flowers, and with the exception of adding new flavours, Fentimans are still making their sodas the same as they did back at the turn of the century. Some production processes have been updated, for example, pasteurisation has been introduced to extend the shelf life of the drinks. This, in turn, causes the loss of some carbon dioxide, so addition of mild carbonation was introduced. =21st century= Fentimans expects to double its turnover from 2015 to 2019 driven by demand from mainland Europe and the US. Fentimans has franchised in the US, where products are manufactured in Pennsylvania and are available across North America. More than two-thirds of Fentimans' overseas sales are in Europe, with the bulk of the remainder in the US, Japan, South America, Canada and Russia. Both UK and US divisions use the same recipe and brewing methods to create Fentimans. North America has purchased identical brewery equipment to that used decades ago, to maintain the characteristic flavour. As the 'free-from' market has now appeared Fentimans consider their gluten free alcoholic ginger beer a \\"perfect fit\\" for this demand. Another division of the business that is now fast growing is the Fentimans mixer range. These include tonic, diet tonic, rose lemonade, bitter lemonade and ginger ale.Some of the Fentimans 275ml range =Botanical brewing= Thomas Fentiman's botanical brewing is a technique using a combination of infusion, blending and fermentation of natural ingredients. This approach has not changed much in over 100 years as the knowledge and expertise have been passed on from generation to generation of the Fentiman family. Thomas Fentiman's original recipe involved milling ginger roots before putting them into copper steam-jacketed pans and leaving them to simmer to release their flavour. Natural botanical ingredients such as herbs, natural flavourings, sugar, spring water and brewer's yeast were then added, thoroughly stirred, and boiled together. The liquid was then transferred into wooden vats and left to undergo the process of fermentation. The liquid went on fermenting and was then decanted from the wooden vats into the iconic handmade stone jars ('grey hens') where it would be ready to drink within seven days.

He was a cousin of Alex Harvey. His earliest known band was The Hot Valves, formed in 1976. The band was influenced by Bill Nelson and Mick Ronson, and their name was taken from a Be- Bop Deluxe EP. They were Gardner on guitars and lead vocals, Coling King on drums, and Danny Mitchell on keyboards (the latter two later of Modern Man and Messengers), and split up in 1977. In 1977, he joined a third band named Zones, composed of drummer Kenny Hyslop, keyboardist Billy McIsaac and bassist Russell Webb, who previously were part of PVC2, along with Midge Ure, who quit and moved to London to form The Rich Kids after the demise of the teenybop band Slik. They released singles including \\"Stuck with You\\", \\"Sign of the Times\\", \\"Looking to the Future\\" and \\"Mourning Star\\", and an album called Under Influence (1979), which was unsuccessful, before splitting up. After Zones, Gardner dedicated himself to a brief solo career, releasing two singles in 1982: \\"Golden Youth\\" and \\"Imation\\". Then he joined a fledgling Euro disco band, Endgames, with whom released two hits, \\"First Last for Everything\\" and \\"Waiting for Another Chance\\". The band split up around 1985.

Established in 1884, it is published every Tuesday from its home base in the village of Haliburton. With its focus on news features, profiles and photography, it has won dozens of awards from the national and provincial newspaper associations. History The early history of the Echo was compiled by Steve Hill of the Haliburton Highlands Museum. In his book \\"History of the Provisional County of Haliburton\\", printed circa 1931, former Echo owner R. H. Baker states that \\"On August 21, 1884, the first copy of the Minden Echo was printed by Brown and Small...\\" Not only did the Echo keep the residents abreast of local happenings through their weekly journal, but they filled private, commercial, and municipal requests for cards, stationery, notices, posters, etcetera, even township voters' lists. Next on the scene appears to have been John Henry Delamere (1836‚Äì1916). The Minden Echo of July 19, 1889 lists him as the publisher and proprietor. On July 28, 1890, part of the Anson side of Main Street Minden was destroyed by fire. Examination of the Minden Echo of May 1, 1891 indicates that by the time the paper had doubled to eight pages, and that the word \\"County\\" had been deleted from its title. It now read as \\"The Minden Echo and Haliburton Recorder\\". Mr. Delamere operated the Echo until around 1906. Richard Henry \\"R.H.\\" Baker (1859‚Äì1935) owned the Minden Echo from circa 1907 to 1923. In 1910, Baker purchased the property on the Minden side of Main Street. It was from premises on this site that the Minden Echo newspaper was published until destroyed in the Minden fire of 1942. Early in World War I Wilmur Louis \\"Mac\\" Macarthur came to Minden to teach school. With some previous printing experience, he worked for R.H. Baker at the Echo as a side-line. In 1916 he married a Minden girl, Louisa Mae Welch. A deed of land dated March 1, 1923 indicates that on that day Macarthur purchased the Minden Echo property from Baker for $1,000, the sale presumably including the business itself. Electricity came to Minden late in 1935 with the opening of the Orillia Water Light & Power Commission plant on the Gull River, and by 1937 or '38, the Echo office had been wired for electricity. At that point, the press was converted to electrical power. Tragedy struck Minden in the early morning hours of May 15, 1942 when the village's worst conflagration since 1890 swept the Minden side of Main Street, destroying virtually everything, including the Echo building. Macarthur died in 1945 at the young age of 55. Mae Macarthur carried on in the printing business after her husband's death. She was no stranger to the business, and ran the shop more or less single-handedly afterwards. When her son Jack decided by 1950 that the printing profession was not the one he wished to pursue, she decided not to hold onto it anymore, and the Minden Echo printing shop was sold. On April 1, 1950, Clifford Booth of Minden, a printer, purchased the business. Then on July 25, 1950, he sold it to a partnership consisting of Mrs. Loyola Webster and Timothy Rogers. On June 16, 1951, Mrs. Webster bought out Rogers and became sole owner. Under Mrs. Webster the Minden Echo newspaper was revived. Mrs. Webster had the Minden Echo until November 1, 1951 when she sold out to the partnership consisting of Walter Noice, Berkeley Feir, and his son Creighton. Feir and Noice changed the name of the Minden Echo newspaper to the Haliburton County Echo, and put out their first issue on November 8, 1951. The Haliburton County Echo moved to new quarters in Haliburton Village early in 1952. The last Echo printed in Minden was the issue of December 20, 1951. The next Echo was that of January 10, 1952, which was the first time that a newspaper had ever been printed in Haliburton Village. Sometime in the 1950s, Feirs bought out Noice. Mr. Feir Sr. was forced to resign for health reasons in the early 1970s, and Mrs. Feir died in 1973. Late in 1973, Creighton Feir sold the Haliburton County Echo to John Zylstra. In 1976, the Echo set up a sister paper in Minden known as the Minden Recorder. Its inaugural edition was July 28, 1976, and it ran until August 17, 1977 when it was merged with the Haliburton County Echo to form a single paper, the Haliburton County Echo and Minden Recorder. The Echo moved in 1976 from its long-time quarters in Berkeley Feir's former pool room to new facilities below the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Zylstra sold the paper to a group of local businessmen consisting of Creighton Feir, Vince Connaughan, Peter Curry, Don Popple, Dave Gray, Gerry Dawson, and Ken Wilson. In 1985, Len Pizzey, an Echo staff member since 1978, bought the Echo. The Minden Recorder portion of the paper's title was dropped in 1991. In 1993, the Echo's Creighton Feir died. With more than 40 years to his credit, he was the longest serving staff member in the history of the Echo, a man whose career spanned both the letterpress and offset eras. In 1985, Pizzey hired a young reporter named Martha Perkins. Three years later he decided to concentrate more on the business side of the newspaper and named Perkins as editor, a position she has held until the present day. Over the years the Echo‚Äôs list of publications grew: Summer Guide, Winter Guide, Fall Tour, Home and Cottage Services Directory, all published once a year; County Life (now called Cottage Times) published weekly in the four summer months; and the now defunct Senior Life (later called Go.) In 1996, Pizzey purchased the former Laking House overlooking Head Lake Park on Haliburton‚Äôs main street and transformed it into the Echo‚Äôs new home. In November 2001 he bought the Minden Times from long- time owner Jack Brezina, who retired from the newspaper business. Perkins became editor of both papers, which share staff. In August 2004, Pizzey sold both the Echo and the Times to Osprey Media Group, staying on as group publisher for the Echo, Times, Barry‚Äôs Bay This Week and Bancroft This Week. In November 2005, Pizzey decided to retire and David Zilstra, formerly of the Napanee Guide, took over as the four papers‚Äô general manager. In November 2009, Perkins left the position of editor to take over the Bowen Island Undercurrent in British Columbia, appointing reporter Jenn Watt as the managing editor of the four papers. In January 2010, John Bauman became the general manager, replacing Zilstra, who took the top spot at the Barrie Examiner. In December 2013, it was announced that Sun Media was selling the Echo, along with sister publications the Minden Times and Bancroft This Week, in a deal that included a merger with a local competitor. That merger proved ill-fated, falling apart in a month, and the Echo along with the Times and Bancroft This Week became property of White Pine Media. Zilstra was brought back as general manager in February 2014.

Although the countries and conflict may not be real, the aircraft and weapons used are completely accurate. The conflict is modeled as a typical Cold War era 'proxy' war between the United States and USSR where Dhimar gets help from the US and Paran uses imported Soviet equipment and expertise. Third Wire Productions developed the game based on the original Strike Fighters: Project 1 but had to be vastly rewritten to work with the Vista platform. In doing so the latest graphical, Artificial Intelligence, and features were written into the simulation. In April 2009, Strike Fighters 2: Vietnam was released, followed in June 2009 by Strike Fighters 2: Europe detailing several possible open war scenarios in the 1960s and 1970s, and by Strike Fighters 2: Israel in October 2009 which represents the various Israel-Arab wars focusing on the Six Day War, War of Yom Kippur and the Israel-Lebanon war. Expansion Pack 1 (for Strike Fighters 2: Israel) was released in June 2010 adding the Suez Crisis and Expansion Pack 2 (for Strike Fighters 2: Europe) followed on December 1, 2010 adding a possible 1950's scenario, both containing new 1950's craft to fly. Eventually, a Vista/7 only expansion named Strike Fighters 2: North Atlantic was released on May 9, 2012 that added more in-depth carrier ops, better avionics, terrain, better weapon systems simulation, and more. All of the games (except the expansion packs) can be installed stand-alone, or they can be merged to make all the stock aircraft available in all games.  Story  The storyline of Strike Fighters is set during a fictional conflict between the Kingdom of Dhimar and the Empire of Paran. The story begins in 1919, when geologists discover oil in the Valley of Kerman, a place at the Dhimari-Parani border. When drilling operations begin in the oil fields, Shah Mushani of Paran sends his troops across the border, beginning a long conflict between the nations. In September 1933, Shah Mushani decides to put a halt to the conflict, following numerous attempts to capture the Mazadran oil fields. While Dhimar becomes a wealthy and economically powerful country, Paran has become poor. In February 1957, Halani Khomar, a Soviet-backed revolutionary leader, stages a bloody coup against the Mushani regime. Once in power, Khomar begins building up the Parani military forces, buying the newest fighter aircraft and tanks from the Soviet Union. King Husani Karmar al'Galbhi of Dhimar, fearing a new war, decides to approach the US for military assistance. Tensions between the two countries culminate in two years of terrorist attacks in Dhimari border cities. In June 1959, the Dhimari ports become subject to a Parani naval blockade, stopping all shipping from and to Dhimar. Prince Fa'ad al'Galbhi, commander of the Dhimari Air Force, starts an emergency buildup of air power by creating several Special Operations Wings, manned by foreign mercenary pilots willing to fight. In July, the US dispatches US Naval and Air Force squadrons to assist their ally.

It has in the past been spelt as Liddiard Tregooze and in many other ways. The parish includes the small village of Hook, and the hamlets of Hook Street and Ballard's Ash. History Lydiard House Lydiard Tregoze is mentioned in the Doomsday Book as a manor belonging to Alfred of Marlborough, Baron of Ewyas and a Tenant-in-Chief to King William I of England. Near Royal Wootton Bassett, the parish of Lydiard Tregoze was part of the Kingsbridge Hundred, while its village originally centred on the medieval parish church of St Mary and the nearby manor house, Lydiard House, which came to be the home of the St John family, Viscounts Bolingbroke. However, the original village of Lydiard Tregoze disappeared, giving way to the grounds of an important country house, although St Mary's church survives and contains important monuments. Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, was the stepdaughter of Oliver St John of Lydiard Tregoze. His marriage to her mother, Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso, produced six children to whom she remained close throughout her life, and this gave the St Johns considerable influence at Court in the early decades of the Tudor dynasty. In 1615, Lucy St John, daughter of Sir John St John of Lydiard Tregoze, married Sir Allen Apsley, one of the founders of the New England Company.New England Charter at yale.edu Anne St John of Lydiard, the daughter of Sir John St John, 1st Baronet, was married on 2 October 1632 to Sir Francis Henry Lee, 2nd Baronet of Ditchley, son of Sir Henry Lee, 1st Baronet and Eleanor Wharton. Anne was married a second time in 1644 to Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester, a leading Royalist during the English Civil War, son of Charles Wilmot, 1st Viscount Wilmot and Sarah Anderson. Anne St John was the mother of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester and grandmother of Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield. In 1801, the population of the parish was 578, in 1901 it was 618, and in 1971 549.Lydiard Tregoze at visionofbritain.org.uk John Bartholomew's Gazetteer of the British Isles (1887) describes Lydiard Tregoze as: \\"Liddiard Tregooze, par. and vil., Wilts, 1 mile SE. of Liddiard Millicent, 5142 ac., pop. 660.\\"Liddiard Millicent extract at visionofbritain.org.uk Lydiard Tregoze has been suggested as a location for the 9th century Battle of Ellandun. There was a one-room school, supported by Lord Bolingbroke, from the early 1800s. A new school was opened in 1866 near Hook Street, aided by National Society funding; this had two classrooms and a master's house. An average of 90 pupils attended in 1899, but numbers fell and there were only 30 in 1930. The school closed in 1965 and its 23 pupils transferred to Lydiard Millicent. The building was later extended and is now a small hotel and restaurant. = Midgehall = The manor and tithing of Midgehall was south of Hook. It was granted to Stanley Abbey in the 1150s, and in 1534 leased by William Pleydell. Later members of the Pleydell family sat in Parliament for Wootton Bassett: William's son, William Pleydell (fl.1640); another son, John Pleydell (c.1601-1693); and Edmund Pleydell (c.1652-1726). The Pleydells left Midgehall after Edmund's death. The 18th-century farmhouse survives; the manor house was to its north, and the moat around the former manor house was filled in during construction of the M4 motorway.  Parish church  Monument to Sir John St John A church at Lydiard Tregoze was mentioned in 1100. The present building, in limestone rubble with some ashlar, has a nave and north aisle from the 13th century, while the chancel, south aisle with porch, and tower are of the 15th. A painted triptych was begun in 1615, its outer panels showing the St John family tree. The south chancel chapel was rebuilt for the St John family in 1633. The plastered nave walls carry paintings, some from the 13th century. Windows have reset medieval glass, and the west window of 1859 is by Alexander Gibbs. A canopied monument to Sir John St John and his wives, c. 1635, is within railings. The tower has six bells, three of them cast by Roger I Purdue in 1635. The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1955. Pevsner wrote \\"Not a big church, but cram-full of enjoyable furnishings, richer than any other of similar size in the country\\". The benefice was united with Lydiard Millicent in 1956; the incumbent lived at Lydiard Millicent. The two parishes were united in 1981 and following the 1989 building of a church in the Swindon suburb of Shaw, the parish was renamed West Swindon and the Lydiards in 1996. A reorganisation effective in 2018 saw the separation of Lydiard Millicent parish, and today the church is part of the West Swindon and Lydiard Tregoze Church Partnership. Parish registers survive from 1666 and are kept in the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives.Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire, England at genuki.org.uk The medieval wall paintings were included in the Church of England's \\"100 Church Treasures\\" campaign, an appeal launched in 2013 which addresses the 100 artworks most in need of conservation. Beginning in 2016, the Lydiard Park Heritage Trust was awarded grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards a ¬£1m project to restore and improve the interior of the church. Lydiard Park and Lydiard House Lydiard Park was the home of the St John family from 1420 until 1940. In 1943, the local authority, the Corporation of Swindon, bought the then dilapidated house and its overgrown park from the estate trustees. The estate now belongs to Swindon Borough Council, the successor of the Corporation. The parkland is operated as a country park and entertainment venue; the house is open to the public in the summer and now has a significant art collection, including fine painted panels by Lady Diana Beauclerk. Notable people See Viscount Bolingbroke for notable members of the St John family. Giles Mompesson (1583/1584 ‚Äì 1663), a politician who was sentenced for corruption, erected a monument in the church following the death of his wife Katherine in 1633. Transport The Wilts & Berks Canal (1810‚Äì1914) crossed the parish. The Great Western Main Line railway follows a similar route; there are no local stations, the nearest being Swindon. Between 1840 and 1841, as the railway was being built in stages from London, a temporary terminus known as Wootton Bassett Road was at Hay Lane. The M4 motorway also crosses the parish, and its junction 16 provides routes to West Swindon, Royal Wootton Bassett and Wroughton.

Plot summary The main character is Steven Masters, a spoiled 23-year-old who happens to be the only son of the world's richest man. At a party he (while drunk) states that he wishes to go on a proposed space flight to a distant life bearing planet called Mittend. Mittend is 30 light years from Earth and is the closest life bearing planet. When he is told that he does not qualify, he gets indignant and sets upon a campaign to join in the expedition. Using his father's money he is able to get passage. Six weeks later he arrives on the planet. It turns out to be very similar to Earth, with a breathable atmosphere. Upon landing he wanders off from the main group and meets the natives. The natives turn out to be naked and primitive but have a powerful group mind named \\"Mother\\". The natives, upon seeing Steven, chase after him and when they catch him and touch him, his mind gets traded into the body of a 38-year-old bar waiter back on earth. The bar waiter's mind gets transferred to Steven's body on the other planet. It turns out that the bar waiter used to work for Steven as a butler. Steven blamed him for a crime he did not commit and got him fired. Immediately after the transfer, he goes into psychological shock and the bar is forced to call an ambulance. They sedate him and he has to spend a few days in the hospital. His story (of being mind swapped) gets out and combined with the fact the expedition has gone missing, he becomes a sensation. While in the hospital, Masters Senior (his father) comes to visit him. He leaves stating that the person there is not Steven. Upon leaving the hospital, he gets picked up by the bartender who drives him to work. He works the day.

Donnelly (November 14, 1866 October 20, 1948), was appointed to the Senate of Canada for life by Prime Minister Robert Laird Borden May 26, 1913 to represent the senatorial division for Bruce South, Ontario. He was the youngest Senator chosen at that time. With more than 40 years of political experience, Senator Donnelly died at the home he built in Pinkerton on October 20, 1948 at the age of 81, approximately one and one half miles from where he was born. His wife died on December 30, 1960 at the age of 89. James J. Donnelly had the occupation as a lumberman, president/manager, and rancher. Prior to the Canadian Senate, James J. Donnelly was the Reeve and Clerk for the Township of Greenock, Ontario and Warden of Bruce County in 1902. Senator Donnelly bought and his family ran a lumber mill out of Chepstow. He also raised beef cattle. In 1895 James J. Donnelly married Julia Mcnab, the daughter of Michael Mcnab and Magdalena Brohman of Chepstow and took over the old homestead from his parents who retired to Kingsbridge. However he soon became interested in the lumbering business and bought a large section of the Greenock Swamp from W. D. Cargill. So he moved with his young family to the nearby village of Pinkerton where in 1904 he built a spacious white brick residence. Early in life James embarked on a political career. After being elected Reeve of Greenock Township, he was chosen as Warden of Bruce County in 1902. In 1904, he was elected as a Conservative member of Parliament for the Riding of East Bruce in the by-election which followed the death of W. D. Cargill. He was defeated in the 1904 federal election later that year in Bruce South but won the riding in the 1908 and 1911 elections. His eldest son, Frank, followed his father's example of public service and was a Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario. His son Jim of Goderich, in turn, now holds that position. The youngest son, Harold, like his father was Warden of Bruce and his son Maurice later held this position, thus setting a record of three generations as Wardens of Bruce. Mertis, his second born, was a teacher of mathematics and married William Flannery, a North Bay lawyer in 1932. For her achievements in Community Service during World War II, she was named a member of the Order of the British Empire by George VI in 1946.

From the 14th century Universal History by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani. Buddhism in Iran dates back to the 2nd century, when Parthians, such as An Shigao, were active in spreading Buddhism in China. Many of the earliest translators of Buddhist literature into Chinese were from Parthia and other kingdoms linked with present-day Iran. History =Pre-Islamic Iran= Buddhists were persecuted during the Sasanid rule in the vast territory they ruled, as they made Zoroastrianism the state religion in 224 AD, and thereafter burned many Buddhist sites in the regions where it was practised, namely Central Asia. Surviving Buddhist sites in the easternmost Sassanian territories comprising modern day Central Asia were later raided in the 5th century by the White Huns. =Arab conquests and decline= At the time of the Arab conquests in the mid-7th century, much of the eastern Iranian world was mainly Buddhist.

He was the eldest son of Frederick III, Duke of Legnica, by his wife Katharina, daughter of Henry V, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Life =Early years= In 1551, Henry XI's father was removed from the government of Legnica by Emperor Charles V. The decision was dictated by the Emperor because of the behavior of Frederick III, who joined the coalition of Protestant rebels princes, and also supported the long-time enemy of the Habsburgs, King Henry II of France. Henry XI was chosen as the new Duke of Legnica, but because he was only twelve years old, regents were appointed from the Duchy, the Imperial governor, and Bishop of Wroclaw, Balthasar von Promnitz and George II the Pious, Duke of Brzeg (Frederick III's younger brother), in whose court Henry spent several years studying science. After the abdication of Emperor Charles V in 1556, Frederick III (after promising obedience and loyalty to the new Emperor Ferdinand I) regained the Duchy of Legnica. =Duke of Legnica= On 27 October 1559 the Emperor Ferdinand I decided to remove Frederick again from government, this time for good. As Henry XI was already an adult, this time he took over the rule over Legnica without regents. Frederick III was placed under house arrest, where he was held for the next eleven years until his death on 15 December 1570. Henry XI inherited his father's duchy, which was bankrupt, the debt being 80,000 talers. The new Duke, instead of gradually repaying the debt, increased it dramatically, leaving at the end of his reign a debt amounting to 700 000 talers. As a Duke of Legnica, Henry XI tried to get refinance the debt. In 1567 he proposed them in exchange for 120 000 talers the G≈Çogow Privilege, who garantized the freedom from the homage of the subjects who declared him his heir. However, the idea wasn't accepted. On 24 December 1571 Henry XI tried to induce his subjects to pay off his debts, offering against their own goods and valuables. Also declared their devotion in return for a fixed salary, ensuring that corresponding to his position on the social level. Given the failure of the proposals, Henry XI decided keep in captivity the representatives of the Legnica states until they signed an agreement to pay taxes for almost 66 000 talers. After regaining their freedom they fled to Vienna, where the representatives made to the Emperor Maximilian II a complaint against the Duke of Legnica. The Emperor appointed a special committee to look into this matter. =Trip to the Holy Roman Empire= In March 1575 Henry XI, wanting to calm down the difficult situation in his Duchy, went on a journey to the Empire. During his absence Legnica was administrated by his younger brother Frederick IV, who in December 1571 was named co-ruler of the Duchy, but still remained in his ward. The trip lasted three years, during which Henry XI visited several cities including: Prague (where he took part of the coronation of Emperor Rudolf II as King of Bohemia on 22 September 1575), Worms, Regensburg, Augsburg, Heidelberg, Mainz, Speyer, Ingolstadt, Prague again, Cieszyn, Nuremberg, Strasbourg, Frankfurt am Main, K√∂ln and Leipzig. During this time, Henry XI was hosted in several German courts. While in the Electorate of the Palatinate, he joined to the army of Louis I, Prince of Cond√©, which huguenot forces clashed with the new Catholic King of France (and the former King of Poland) Henry III. With the money who Henry XI received from Legnica he could pay nearly 9,000 soldiers. When the Emperor Maximilian II learned about his involvement in the France's religious fights, he ordered the Duke to abandon the service. However, Henry XI refused to obey the Imperial order and remain at the side of the Prince of Cond√©, who give him a payment of his services. In May 1576 after the signing of the Peace of Bealieu, the religious war in France ended and with this also the services of Henry XI in the French army. No longer receiving his military salary, he soon lost all means of livelihood. The Duke began to contract debts everywhere. At that time (spring of 1577), he finally decided to return to Legnica. In total, the three-year expedition of Henry XI to the Holy Roman Empire cost 32,000 talers. =Return to Legnica= While Henry XI fought in France, his younger brother Frederick IV decided to use that moment to be released from his guardianship. He went to the Emperor Maximilian II, asking to review the divisionary treaty of Legnica. Special Commissioners under imperial decree of 13 March 1576 declared Frederick IV as the new rule of Legnica, who formally took possession of the government one month later, on 17 April. The new duke was obliged to ensure Henry XI's family (which remained in Silesia) in all his needs, including cash and food. At the same time, the date when the Duchy of Legnica was formally divided between the brothers was set on 29 September 1577. However, that didn't happen, because Maximilian II died on 12 October 1576 and the new Emperor Rudolf II tried to re-examine the case. The commitment of Frederick IV to pay the debts of both his brother and father and his characterized rule of prudence and economy didn't like to the Legnica nobility, accustomed to the \\"generous\\" previous rulers. For that reason, they enthusiastically welcomed Henry XI when he returned on 9 November 1577 from his long trip. Before Henry XI opened up a chance to recover power in Legnica, the death of Maximilian II (who totally disapproved him) left him at the mercy of Rudolf II, in which the coronation as Bohemian King Henry XI participated in 1575. However, not being able to wait to settle a dispute about the Legnica patrimony, Henry XI mastered the Grodziec Castle, where he began to harass the states of his brother. Despite attempts to mediate, this situation lasted several months, until Frederick IV finally won the battle and the government of Legnica as a sole ruler. Grodziec was given to the Count of Zedlitz and on 16 November 1578, Henry XI went on a new trip to Germany, visiting Halle, Berlin and Rostock. At that time, Henry XI's wife, Sophie of Hohenzollern, desperately asked Emperor Rudolf II for the restitution of her husband. On 5 October 1580, Rudolf II cancelled the decree of 17 April 1576 and restitute Henry XI as a rule of Legnica; however, he was compelled to share the government with his brother. Henryk XI settled his residence in Legnica, and Frederick IV was forced to move to Chojn√≥w. On 28 October 1580, was held the ceremonial entry of Henry XI to Legnica. The Duke of Legnica continue with his disrespectful behavior against his sovereign. Despite several months of the Imperial Decree who restored him, Henry XI wasn't required to paid homage to the Emperor, and also didn't participate in the Silesian sejmach. On 7 June 1581, a punish military expedition was created, led by the Imperial Governor of Silesia and Bishop of Wroclaw, Marcin Gerstmann. However, the expedition failed to win the city by surprise, since Henry XI take the advantage and collect food and weapons from his other cities in order to make the resistance. Therefore, began the negotiations between both parties, which have resulted in Henry XI agreed to pay tribute to Karl II, Duke of Ziƒôbice- Ol√©snica (M√ºnsterberg-√ñls), and also to appear before the Emperor in Prague. Henry XI arrived to Prague on 9 July 1581. However, he had to wait months for an audience with Emperor Rudolf II. The punishment against him was harsh: Henry XI was arrested and lost the control over Legnica, who was given again to Frederick IV, who (like the first time) was obliged to take care of Henry XI's family, paying him the sum of 30 talers weekly. The first year of captivity Henry XI spent in Prague Castle, and the next three years at the Wroclaw castle until the spring of 1585, when was transferred to Schweidnitz. From there, on 30 September 1585, and after bribed the guards, Henry XI managed to escape. He was persecuted for the troops of the new Bishop of Wroclaw, Andrew Jerin and his own uncle George II the Pious, Duke of Brzeg. However, they didn't have success, and after four days digging through forests, Henry XI managed to flee to Poland, where he spent the rest of his life. =Trip to Poland= Henry XI had very good relations with the Jagiellon dynasty. He was related to them in many ways: his grandfather Frederick II of Legnica married firstly with Princess Elisabeth, daughter of King Casimir IV and secondly with Sophie of Brandenburg-Ansbach (Henry XI's grandmother and in turn granddaughter of King Casimir IV), and Frederick II's brother, George I of Brieg married with Anna of Pomerania, another granddaughter of Casimir IV. King Sigismund II August was even patronize Henry XI's father, Frederick III. In 1569 the Duke of Legnica accepted the invitation of the Polish King and participated in the Sejm in Lublin, were was concluded the Union of Lublin. At the meeting with Sigismund II August, he gave Henry XI two lions and precious jewels. This trip to Poland brought to the Duke of Legnica an undoubtedly splendor, but also a high cost, 24,000 talers. In January 1575 Henry XI participated in the funeral of the Bishop of Poznan, Adam Konarski; there he consolidated a close friendship with the late Bishop's younger brother, John. And the summer of that year came to Krakow, in an effort support his own candidacy to the Polish throne. After Henry XI escaped to Poland both Emperor Rudolf II and Duke George II of Brzeg unsuccessfully tried to convince to King Stefan Bathory to bring him back. Immediately after the imperial envoy Andrzej Opali≈Ñski came to the Polish court, he went on a journey through the land of their ancestors. Henry XI visited the Kruszwica, Lowicz and Warsaw. Then he went to Grodno, where he remained at the side of the King for the next three weeks. At the end of his trip he went to Kr√≥lewca (now Kaliningrad) to visit his relative, Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia. During the election in 1586 Henry XI supported the candidacy of Sigismund Vasa of Sweden. He even was sent as a personal envoy of Queen Anna of Poland to Stockholm in order to garantized her support to Sigismund. In a short time he managed to establish a friendly relations with the King-elect, who promised him that every diplomatic effort to recover his patrimony. On 9 December 1587 Henry XI took part in the coronation of Sigismund III Vasa as King of Poland. =Death= Henry XI died unexpectedly on 3 March 1588 in Krakow. The mysterious circumstances around his death supposed a foul play of the Habsburg court. The Duke's funeral caused several troubles, because until his death Henry XI remained Lutheran. Sigismund III Vasa pointed to the late Duke's daughters and brother, who asked the removal of the body and his return of Legnica. However, these plans they had to face the strong opposition of Emperor Rudolf II, who refused to permit the entry of the body of a rebel in his country. Temporarily, the Duke's coffin was deposited with the Franciscans in Krakow, who in return for accepting the body of a Protestant demanded a payment and ensure that the body of the Duke of Legnica soon be taken away from them. In view of the failure of Duke's family to gain the Imperial approval, after a few months the coffin was directly exposed to the street. Eventually, thanks to the efforts of his family and many Silesians, on 9 November 1588 was finally placed in the choir of the Chapel of the Holy Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary () in Krakow. Marriage and Issue In the Legnica Castle (Schloss Liegnitz) on 11 November 1560, Henry XI married Sophie (b. 23 March 1535 ‚Äì d. 12 February 1587), daughter of George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. Their relationship wasn't always good. Both spouses had a strong personality and the quarrels between them (often at the eyes of the entire court) were notorious, mostly because of Henry XI's affairs with other women. They had six children: #Katharina Sophie (b. 7 August 1561 ‚Äì d. Schloss Friedrichsburg bei Vohenstrauss, 10 May 1608), married on 26 February 1587 to Frederick, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken-Vohenstrauss-Parkstein. #Anna Maria (b. 3 January 1563 ‚Äì d. Amberg, 28 February 1620). #Emilia (b. 26 December 1563 ‚Äì d.

Of his two sons, the eldest was either stillborn or died shortly after birth, and the second lived only three months; of his four daughters, the youngest lived 23 months. His eldest daughter, Katharina Sophie, by marriage Countess Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken-Vohenstrauss-Parkstein, gave birth to a daughter and twin sons, but all died before five months of age. Without proper dowries, his other two daughters Anna Maria and Emilia remained unmarried, and when their cousin Joachim Frederick knew this, both were passed the thirty-five years, and it's no longer found suitable candidates for their hands.

Biography  Frederic Foley was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota in 1891. He studied languages at Yale University, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1914, and then trained in medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine until his graduation in 1918.Frederic Foley biography at the William P Didusch Center for Urologic History He subsequently worked with William Halsted and Harvey Cushing, and worked at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Boston on the junior surgical staff. Although there is no record of his training in urology, he was certified by the American Board of Urology in 1937. Foley worked as a urologist in Boston, Massachusetts and later became chief of urology at Ancker Hospital, St. Paul, Minnesota. (Ancker hospital was renamed St. Paul Ramsey Medical Center and is now known as Regions Hospital.) He died in 1966 of lung cancer.  Foley catheter  Foley first described the use of a self-retaining balloon catheter in 1929, to be used to achieve haemostasis after cystoscopic prostatectomy.Foley F.E.B. Cystoscopic prostatectomy: a new procedure: preliminary report. J Urol 1929; 21:289‚Äì306 He worked on development of this design for use as an indwelling urinary catheter, to provide continuous drainage of the bladder, in the 1930s. His design incorporated an inflatable balloon towards the tip of the tube which could be inflated inside the bladder to retain the catheter without external taping or strapping. He demonstrated this to the American Urologists Society in 1935,John Robinson. Choosing a catheter.

J Urol 1937;38:140‚Äì3 While he was still developing his catheter, a patent was issued to Paul Raiche of the Davol Rubber Company of Providence, Rhode Island in 1936. Four months later, in October 1936, Foley applied for the patent, and was awarded this after appearing before the patent office Board of Appeals. Raiche appealed this decision in court, and it was overturned, returning the patent to Raiche. A further request for a hearing made by Foley was refused, and so the patent stayed with Raiche.  Legacy  The C. R. Bard Company of New Jersey started distributing the catheters, under the name of Foley catheters, from 1935; consequently, the name has remained with Foley despite the patent having remained with the Davol Company. Although the materials used to make catheters have changed, the basic design of the 1930s has not. In addition to his work on urinary catheters, Foley also described a novel technique for treating strictures of the pelvi-ureteric junction which is known as the Foley Operation or the Foley Y-plasty pyeloplasty.Foley F.E.

He was known as \\"The Flying Rabbi,\\" a title he had earned from soldiers as he traveled by plane to Jewish airmen at isolated locations throughout North Africa. Biography Born on June 9, 1916, to immigrants who had arrived in 1906 from Pamuran in Eastern Galicia (Eastern Europe), Louis Werfel attended Yeshiva and Mesivta Torah Vodaath, and in 1933, enrolled in Yeshiva College, where he was known for his sincerity and commitment towards Orthodox Judaism. Werfel was active in student affairs, involved in the Religious Zionist Ha'Poel ha'Mizrachi movement and was a personal friend of Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel, the first president of Yeshiva University. At Yeshiva College, as secretary (1936-1937) of its Student Council and at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, as president (1938-1940) of the Students of Yeshiva (S.O.Y.) organization, Werfel was very involved with two student organized publications: Hazedek (the official student newspaper of RIETS and Yeshiva College) and Hedenu (the 1936 publication in honor of RIETS' Jubilee anniversary). One Sunday in 1937, Louis met Adina Gerstel in the Yeshiva College cafeteria, (where she frequently went with fellow teachers from the Inwood Jewish Center); they were engaged in 1939, and married on September 9, 1940. After receiving his Semikha from Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik and Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel in 1940, Werfel served as rabbi of the Mount Kisco (New York) Hebrew Congregation for less than a year. In Mount Kisco, Louis and Adina Werfel focused their attentions on the children and adolescents of the community, with whom they learned and studied, giving over the impression that a life filled with Torah and Mitzvot can be enjoyable. Afterwards, Yeshiva College sent Rabbi Werfel to serve as rabbi of Knesseth Israel Synagogue (Birmingham, Alabama) where he and his wife educated the congregation in the tenets of Orthodoxy, and established a Torah-true Talmud Torah for the children of the community. One congregant still living there, who Werfel taught how to read from the Torah, vividly recalls the sensitivity that Rabbi Werfel displayed towards preparing the youngster for his Bar Mitzvah. Rabbi Werfel was a member of the Rabbinical Council of America and while in Birmingham, served on the National Jewish Welfare Board's Army and Navy Committee. In August 1942, Rabbi Werfel enlisted as a chaplain in the United States Army. In his application for service, Louis Werfel wrote that he was motivated by recognition of what he considered to be his duty as a rabbi. During November 1942, Louis Werfel trained at the Chaplain's Center at Harvard University; and afterwards, was stationed at the Boca Raton Air Force Base in Florida, where his leadership talents were recognized by his superior officers after he organized a Pesach Seder in 1943 for all Jewish personnel of the base. Even though Chaplain Werfel was exempt from overseas service because of minor physical disabilities‚Äîhe had a small infection in his eye‚Äîhe repeatedly placed such requests. On August 1, 1943, Werfel was sent to North Africa, where he served as Chaplain with the 12th Air Force Service Command, where his area of operations included Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Sicily. Rabbi Werfel was unyielding in his observance as an Orthodox Jew, and while he and his Conservative and Reform colleagues were often in disagreement on many matters of theology and observance, Werfel understood that he and the Army's other 310 Chaplains were drawn together by a common vision and in a common service: to offer religious and moral guidance to all of the Jewish personnel of the armed forces. During a time when Orthodoxy was thought of as outdated, Louis Werfel, who spoke and wrote English well, could aptly speak about jazz or the Mona Lisa while remaining erudite and informed of Torah law. \\"That combination, at that time, was very rare,\\" his wife Adina recalled. While stationed in North Africa, Chaplain Werfel continued caring for the needs of the Jewish soldiers there, where he often dealt with issues such as Shabbat, Kashrut and other religious issues affecting soldiers. Werfel often spent Shabbat in various Jewish communities throughout North Africa, and on one occasion, observed an Oneg Shabbat conducted by the local Zionist youth: \\"It was an inspiring sight to watch those French-speaking, Sephardic-familied youngsters, about 200 of them, singing the same Palestinian songs that our youngsters sing back in the United States,\\" wrote Werfel. In his last report to the Chaplaincy Commission, Werfel wrote about the religious condition of the soldiers in battle: \\"War raised old religious problems in new guises: in one combat outfit the flight surgeon was overwrought because of an experience in his squadron. On Yom Kippur, a Jewish pilot had gone to Services in the magnificent Grande Synagogue in Tunis and spent almost the entire day in prayer, pleading for life and safety and happiness. The very next day the pilot flew away on a mission  and never returned.\\" Werfel's last request to the National Jewish Welfare Board was for 10,000 prayer books in French translation for Jewish men serving with the French Free Forces, whose own chaplains could not arrange for the printing of siddurim. On December 25, 1943, the State Department sent a telegram informing Adina Werfel that, while returning from conducting a Hanukah service for American soldiers in Casablanca, the small plane carrying her husband had crashed into the Algerian mountains due to limited visibility caused by bad weather. As a young soldier serving in the American army in Oran, Algeria, Donald B. Butler was one of the soldiers who buried Chaplain Louis Werfel in North Africa with a proper Jewish burial. In 1950, as per Army regulations, Chaplain Werfel's body was sent back to America, where his wife arranged for him to be buried in the newly established State of Israel, in the cemetery in the Religious Zionist Ha'Poel ha'Mizrachi kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. At Tirat Tzvi, its school and synagogue were dedicated in Louis Werfel's memory and his name is included on the Kibbutz's memorial for soldiers killed in action. Louis (Eliezar) Werfel's memorial plaque at Knesseth Israel Congregation, Birmingham, AL. Eulogizing him in Yeshiva's Harry Fischel Beit Midrash, Rabbi Dr. Samuel Belkin, second president of Yeshiva University, recalled how Louis Werfel, \\"sacrificed himself voluntarily on the altar of his God. He lived with a purpose - and died for an even greater purpose.\\" Moses Isaacs, then dean of Yeshiva College, praised 'the Flying Rabbi' as having been a living example of the synthesis of Judaism and general culture. But perhaps the most poignant eulogy was delivered by Rabbi Joseph H. Lookstein, rabbi of Manhattan's Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, where he read from Rabbi Werfel's last report to the Chaplaincy Commission, written several days before his death. \\"The war has brought me to changes of attitude, the full significance of which I still cannot recognize,\\" wrote Werfel. \\"I, who filled pacifist papers on principle when Selective Service was introduced, stood one blustering morning on a flying field and waved good luck to the planes as they rolled by for the take- off. And as I stood there waving them on, wishing them good luck, praying that every one of them would get back safely, there ran through my mind the Talmudic dictum 'Shluchei Mitzvah Ainon Nizakin...' at least that day all planes returned.\\" At the memorial service, Rabbi Lookstein added, \\"all planes returned - all but one...\\" In 1949, the United States Army dedicated a boat, the P.T. Werfel, in Chaplain Louis Werfel's memory and, as is customary, Adina Werfel donated a set of candlesticks for the crew to use in the dining section. Chaplain Louis Werfel was survived by his wife Adina, who later married Rabbi Michael Bernstein, Rosh Yeshiva at RIETS; his father, Isidore; a sister, Ethel; and a brother, Pvt. Abraham Werfel. (Rabbi and Mrs. Bernstein's son, Rabbi Dr. Moshe Bernstein, is currently a professor of Bible at Yeshiva College.)

The headache is daily and unremitting from very soon after onset (within 3 days at most), usually in a person who does not have a history of a primary headache disorder. The pain can be intermittent, but lasts more than 3 months. Headache onset is abrupt and people often remember the date, circumstance and, occasionally, the time of headache onset. One retrospective study stated that over 80% of patients could state the exact date their headache began. The cause of NDPH is unknown, and it may have more than one etiology. NDPH onset is commonly associated with an infection or flu-like illness, stressful life event, minor head trauma, and extra cranial surgery. Infection or flu-like illness and stressful life event are most often cited. The pathophysiology of NDPH is poorly understood. The syndrome is difficult to treat and may persist for years. The age of onset ranges from 6 to greater than 70 years old, with a mean of 35 years. It is found to be more common in females in both the adult and pediatric populations. NDPH is rare. The Akershus study of chronic headache, a population based cross sectional study of 30,000 persons aged 30‚Äì44 years in Norway, found a one-year prevalence of 0.03 percent in the population. In 1986, Vanast was the first author to describe the new daily- persistent headache (NDPH) as a benign form of chronic daily headache (CDH). The criteria for the diagnosis of NDPH were proposed in 1994 (the Silberstein‚ÄìLipton criteria) but not included in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) until 2004. Signs and symptoms The headaches can vary greatly in their clinical presentation and duration. Quality of the headache has been described as dull and/or pressure-like sensation, and throbbing and/or pulsating sensation. The pain is usually on both sides of the head (in 88‚Äì93% of people with NDPH), but may be unilateral, and may be localized to any head region. The pain can fluctuate in intensity and duration, is daily, and lasts more than 3 months. There may be accompanying photophobia, phonophobia, lightheadedness or mild nausea. Co- morbidity with mood disorders has been reported in a subset of patients. Cranial autonomic nervous symptoms occur with painful exacerbations in 21%, and cutaneous allodynia may be present in 26%. In 2002, Li and Rozen conducted a study of 56 patients at the Jefferson Headache Center in Philadelphia and published the following results: * 82% of patients were able to pinpoint the exact day their headache started. * 30% of the patients, the onset of the headache occurred in correlation with an infection or flu-like illness. * 38% of the patients had a prior personal history of headache. * 29% of the patients had a family history of headache. * 68% reported nausea. * 66% reported photophobia. * 61% reported phonophobia. * 55% reported lightheadedness. Imaging and laboratory testing were unremarkable except for an unusually high number of patients who tested positive for a past Epstein- Barr virus infection. Diagnosis Although NDPH is classified as a primary headache syndrome, it must be remembered that a number of important conditions can present with a new-onset persisting headache, and these must be excluded prior to making a diagnosis of a primary headache disorder. The diagnosis is one of excluding the many secondary types or NDPH mimics, which is especially critical early in the course of the disease when a secondary etiology is more likely. NDPH mimics include but are not limited to: * neoplasms * subarachnoid hemorrhage * idiopathic intracranial hypertension * temporal arteritis * chronic subdural hematoma * post-traumatic headaches * sphenoid sinusitis * hypertension * spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak * cervical artery dissections * pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema * cerebral venous thrombosis * Chiari malformation * NDPH with medication overuse headache Many doctors state that the condition is best viewed as a syndrome rather than a diagnosis. Once a diagnosis of NDPH is made, clinicians argue that patients are best managed according to the more detailed pathophysiology-based diagnosis than lumped together into a single group, since a single disorder is unlikely to exist. NDPH is classified as a Primary Headache Disorder by the ICHD-2 classification system (by the IHS) using number 4.8. It is one of the types of primary headache syndromes that present as a chronic daily headache, which is a headache present for more than 15 days a month for more than 3 months. =ICHD criteria= The ICHD diagnostic criteria are:http://ihs- classification.org/en/02_klassifikation/02_teil1/04.08.00_other.html #Headache that, within 3 days of onset, fulfils criteria 2-4 #Headache is present daily, and is unremitting, for > 3 months #At least two of the following pain characteristics: ##bilateral location ##pressing/tightening (non-pulsating) quality ##mild or moderate intensity ##not aggravated by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing #Both of the following: ##no more than one of photophobia, phonophobia or mild nausea ##neither moderate or severe nausea nor vomiting #Not attributed to another disorder Notes: #Headache may be unremitting from the moment of onset or very rapidly build up to continuous and unremitting pain. Such onset or rapid development must be clearly recalled and unambiguously described by the patient. Otherwise it is coded as 2.3 chronic tension-type headache. #History and physical and neurological examinations do not suggest any of the disorders listed in groups 5-12 (including 8.2 medication overuse headaches and its subforms), or history and/or physical and/or neurological examinations do suggest such disorder but it is ruled out by appropriate investigations, or such disorder is present but headache does not occur for the first time in close temporal relation to the disorder. =Criteria revision= Although the original Silberstein‚ÄìLipton criteria and the original description by Vanast make no suggestion for the exclusion of migrainous features in NDPH, the current ICHD criteria exclude patients with migrainous features. When migraine features are present, classification thus becomes problematic. It has been reported that migraine symptoms may be present in over 50% of NDPH patients. The current criteria definition thus excludes more than half of patients with new onset of daily headache. This exclusion due to migrainous features could have adverse scientific, diagnostic, and treatment consequences. One proposal for reclassification of the criteria is from a study conducted on retrospective analysis of the records of 1348 patients regularly treated at the headache clinic of the Department of Neurology of Santa Casa de S√£o Paulo, Brazil, and would be the following subdivision: NDPH with migraine features and without migraine features that would allow the inclusion of all individuals present who has a daily and persistent headache from the beginning. Another proposed reclassification of the criteria is from a study conducted as a retrospective chart review of patients seen at the Headache Center at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York, from September 2005 to April 2009. The revised criteria for NDPH definition does not exclude migraine features (NDPH-R), and three subdivisions were created and described based on prognosis: Persisting, remitting, and relapsing‚Äìremitting. Additionally, this revised criteria would not include parts C or D currently required by the ICHD diagnostic criteria for NDPH. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of NDPH is poorly understood. Research points to an immune-mediated, inflammatory process. Cervical joint hypermobility and defective internal jugular venous drainage have also been suggested as causes. In 1987, Vanast first suggested autoimmune disorder with a persistent viral trigger for CDH (now referred to as NDPH). Post-infectious origins have been approximated to make up anywhere between 30‚Äì80% of NDPH patients in different studies. Viruses that have been implicated include Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus. Non-specific upper respiratory infections including rhinitis and pharyngitis are most often cited by patients. In one study, 46.5% patients recalled a specific trigger with a respiratory tract illness being the most common. In children, almost half report headache onset during an infection. A study by Rozen and Swindan in 2007 found elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine, in the cerebrospinal fluid but not the blood of patients with NDPH, chronic migraine, and post-traumatic headaches suggesting inflammation as the cause of the headaches. NDPH as an inflammatory, post-infectious manifestation indicates a potential meningoencephalitis event in NDPH patients. Tissue specificity is a general feature of post-infectious, immune-mediated conditions, and the meninges are a type of connective tissue membrane. Inflammation of the meninges was first proposed as a possible pathophysiology for migraine in the 1960s and has recently been explored again. This hypothesis is based on meningeal mast cell activation. Reactive arthritis (ReA) is a post-infectious disease entity of synovium/joints with connective tissue membrane (synovial membrane of the joints) which provides a corollary. NDPH has been reported in Hashimoto's encephalopathy, an immune-mediated type of encephalitis. A mean 5-year retrospective analysis of 53 patients with a history of viral meningitis and 17 patients with a history of bacterial meningitis showed an increased onset of subsequent new onset headache and increased severity of those with prior primary headaches. Treatment There is no specific treatment for NDPH. Often they are treated similar to migraines. A number of medications have been used including amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, propranolol, and topiramate. There are no prospective placebo controlled trials of preventive treatment. In those with migrainous features treatment may be similar to migraines. Opiates, or narcotics, tend to be avoided because of their side effects, including the development of medication overuse headaches and potential for dependency. NDPH is often associated with medication overuse. To avoid the development of medication overuse headaches, it is advised not to use pain relievers for more than nine days a month. NDPH, like other primary headaches, has been linked to comorbid psychiatric conditions, mainly mood and anxiety and panic disorders. The spectrum of anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder, should be considered in NDPH patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms. Simultaneous treatment of both disorders may lead to good outcomes. Medications within the tetracycline family, mexiletine, corticosteroids and nerve blocks are being studied. Occipital nerve block have been reported to be helpful for some people. 23/71 people had undergone a nerve block for their severe headache. The NDPH-ICHD group responded to the nerve block much more often (88.9%) than the NDPH with migraine features (42.9% responded to nerve block). Prognosis Most patients have persistent headaches, although about 15% will remit, and 8% will have a relapsing- remitting type. It is not infrequent for NDPH to be an intractable headache disorder that is unresponsive to standard headache therapies.

Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977), is a United States Supreme Court case that involved issues concerning statutory standing in antitrust law. The decision established the rule that indirect purchasers of goods or services along a supply chain cannot seek damages for antitrust violations committed by the original manufacturer or service provider, but it permitted such claims by direct purchasers. Several courts recognize exceptions to the rule. The decision has become known as the \\"Illinois Brick doctrine\\" and is applied to determine whether a plaintiff has standing to bring claims under various federal antitrust statutes. Background In the early 1970s, the United States government filed both civil and criminal charges against eleven concrete block manufacturers in Chicago, stating that they were engaging in price fixing. The defendants pleaded nolo contendere and entered into a settlement with the government. Spurred by this, the government of Illinois filed a new suit at the eleven concrete block manufacturers, asserting they were engaged in conspiratorial price-fixing for concrete blocks to be used for government construction, violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, and seeking treble damage. The defendants sought to have the case dismissed as the government were not direct purchasers of the blocks. In general, these companies sold blocks directly to masonry contractors for them to complete jobs given to them by general contractors during the construction of new buildings; the defendants stated that the government, in paying for the construction of these buildings, were not the ones purchasing the blocks themselves. The district court agreed, citing both the Supreme Court ruling of Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.. that emphasized that direct purchasers of goods have the right to sue manufacturers for anti-trust, and the Seventh Circuit's decision in Commonwealth Edison v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. that determined that the ultimate consumers of goods along a supply chain were \\"too remote and [in]consequential to provide legal standing to sue against the alleged antitrust violator\\". The state appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which overturned the district court's ruling, arguing that the Sherman Act allows for any person that was harmed by antitrust behaviors to bring suit for triple damages. The block manufacturers petitioned to the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari, which was granted. Oral arguments were heard on March 23, 1977 with the decision given on June 9, 1977. Judgment In a 6-3 decision, The Supreme Court held that indirect victims of a price fixing conspiracy had no standing to sue for antitrust violations for raised prices. The majority opinion was written by Justice Byron White, joined by Justices Warren Burger, Potter Stewart, Lewis Powell, William Rehnquist, and John Paul Stevens. It held that if an indirect purchaser of overpriced goods could sue, then it would open the door to ‚Äúmultiple recovery‚Äù. An overcharge might be collected if more than one entity in the chain of distribution of the product could recover for the same violation. White was concerned with the Court making a significant overrule to their previous decision in Hanover Shoe. Justice William Brennan wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun. Brennan wrote that the majority's approach to stay consistent with Hanover Shoe undercut the strength of the language that Congress had written into the Sherman Act. Justice Blackmun also wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing the case's close timing with Hanover likely impacted the result; if Hanover had not been decided, the courts would have likely ruled in favor of the state government.. Exceptions Two exceptions to the direct purchaser rule are potentially recognized in various jurisdictions: the control exception and the preexisting cost-plus contract exception. The control exception, noted in footnote 16 of the Illinois Brick opinion, states that in some situations an indirect purchaser might maintain an antitrust action where the direct purchases is owned or controlled by its customer. This exception is narrowly construed and limited to situations where the relationship involves a functional or economic unity between the direct and indirect purchaser such that there has been effectively one sale.See The preexisting cost-plus contract exception states that an indirect purchaser may have standing where the costs initially borne by the direct purchaser are passed on to the indirect purchaser pursuant to a preexisting cost-plus contract between the parties. In such situation, the overcharging is not absorbed by the direct purchaser but is instead passed on to the indirect purchaser.See Significance Many state antitrust laws reject the Illinois Brick doctrine. Thus, in California v. ARC America Corp.,. the Supreme Court rejected arguments that Illinois Brick preempted broader state antitrust laws such as that of California, which rejected the doctrine. A 2007 Antitrust Modernization Commission Report proposed that Congress should abandon the Illinois Brick doctrine.The Antitrust Modernization Commission was created pursuant to the Antitrust Modernization Commission Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-273, ¬ß¬ß 11051-60, 116 Stat. 1856. The Commission submitted its Report and Recommendations to Congress and the President on April 2, 2007. The Report and other documents relating to its work are found at its website‚Äîhttp://govinfo.library.unt.edu/amc/index.html. The proposal, if adopted, would weaken the federal right of action for direct purchasers by reviving as a defense the fact that the direct purchaser had passed on the overcharge instead of absorbing it, while creating a federal right of action for indirect purchasers. Federal rights of action under the proposal would not be exclusive, but state law claims would be subject to expanded federal jurisdiction to allow consolidation of all claims from a price fix in a single court for both discovery and trial. All recoveries in the consolidated actions would be limited to the initial overcharge, trebled. The applicability of Illinois Brick towards digital marketplaces was the subject of the Supreme Court case, Apple Inc. v. Pepper heard in the 2018-2019 which relates to whether consumers of third-party mobile applications through a marketplace can bring anti-trust actions against the owner of the marketplace. The Court determined that consumers that purchased apps through Apple's iOS app store were direct purchasers and had standing to sue Apple for antitrust actions, despite Apple's insistence that consumers were buying apps from developers.

Labour TD Pat Rabbitte regretted that the D√°il did not have the time to debate the matter properly, whilst the party's financial spokesman Joan Burton said there was a failure on the part of the Government to provide any relevant information about the financial situation of the bank. Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan said during the debate that Ireland's two other main banks, Allied Irish Banks (AIB) and Bank of Ireland, would not be nationalised despite they too enduring major falls in their share prices. He said the Government would instead stand by to inject up to ‚Ç¨2 billion of public money into AIB and Bank of Ireland. =Seanad debate= The bill passed through Seanad √âireann without a vote; however there was a debate on the matter. During the Seanad's debate on the bill, Senator Shane Ross claimed that \\"no-one was being told the truth about Anglo Irish Bank\\" and called an Emergency General Meeting of shareholders which had taken place the previous Friday \\"a disgrace, show[ing] corporate Ireland at its worst, as there were no answers to any questions\\". Independent Senator Joe O'Toole advocated the chasing of those responsible for the bank's nationalisation \\"even into the courts\\", saying that a person could be imprisoned for failure to pay a household bill, yet those who caused the loss of jobs and pensions might not.

The drug originally attracted extensive media coverage proclaiming it a breakthrough, but it has failed to show promise in Phase III trials.  Medical uses  Solanezumab was safely used in combination with approved Alzheimer's disease treatment, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, in the clinical trials. Aside from Alzheimer's disease, there are other amyloid beta related diseases, in which solanezumab could be used, e.g., Down syndrome or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. However, this has not been studied so far.  Adverse effects  No safety concerns were detected in any of the studies. A few patients suffered from mild infusion reactions that resolved on their own. The measured laboratory values and vital signs, showed no changes. Other adverse events that occurred, e.g., headache or hematoma, where not considered as related to treatment. Other anti-amyloid beta antibodies caused amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, which is not the case for solanezumab. Pharmacology = Mechanism of action = Solanezumab binds the amyloid-Œ≤ peptides that aggregate and form plaques in the brain that are an early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. Solanezumab binds the central epitope of monomeric amyloid-Œ≤, KLVFFAED, (PDB ID 4XXD) with picomolar affinity. This epitope is known as the nucleation site for AŒ≤ oligomerization, and it is these oligomers of AŒ≤ that are thought to be toxic to neurons. Solanezumab is thought to act as an ‚Äúamyloid beta sink‚Äù that is ‚Äúfacilitating flux of amyloid beta from a central to peripheral compartment‚Äù. This increases the peripheral elimination of both amyloid beta and the antibody. Amyloid beta plaques mostly consist of amyloid beta42. Solanezumab binds free amyloid beta which causes amyloid beta42 to solubilize to reestablish the equilibrium in the cerebrospinal fluid.  Manufacturing  Solanezumab is expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The produced antibodies are extracted and purified according to the standard procedures of the art.  Society and culture  = Commercial aspects = Solanezumab is developed and investigated by Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN. It is covered under the patent US 7,195,761 B2, which was filed in 2002 by Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, and Washington University, St. Louis, MO. In 2011, TPG-Axon Capital funded part of the phase 3 trials. It will receive an estimated $70 million of based on sales milestones after the launch of the product.  Preclinical trials  The first evidence that antibodies binding the central amyloid beta domain are effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was found in transgenic mice, which express the human amyloid beta precursor protein. Treatment with a murine analog of solanezumab (m266) lead to an increase in plasma amyloid beta, which was all bound to m266. Additionally, the amount of both free amyloid beta in the brain and amyloid beta in plaques was significantly decreased. Due to those results, it is postulated that m266 binds free amyloid beta in the plasma and, therefore, changes the amyloid beta equilibrium between plasma and brain.  Clinical trials  = Phase 1 = In a single-dose, placebo- controlled study (H8A-LC-LZAH) in 19 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, solanezumab was well tolerated over the whole dose range. There were no severe adverse drug reactions. All patients showed dose- dependent amyloid beta responses, but no change in cognition. This negative outcome was expected after only a single dose. = Phase 2 = 52 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease underwent a parallel group, double- blind, randomized, placebo controlled phase 2 trial. They received weekly infusions of either saline or antibody for 12 weeks. The placebo group received only saline, whereas the antibody groups received four different concentrations of solanezumab infusions or saline. They were dosed with either 100 mg every 4 weeks, 100 mg weekly, 400 mg every 4 weeks or 400 mg weekly. Plasma amyloid beta levels increased dose dependently over the course of treatment. In the cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta40 increased, whereas amyloid beta42 increased. This could be due to a change in equilibrium between plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and amyloid beta plaques. However, there were no significant changes in cognition and memory. = Phase 3 = Solanezumab was tested in two phase 3 clinical trials, EXPEDITION 1 and 2 (NCT00905372 and NCT00904683). Both were randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease received either placebo or 400 mg solanezumab infusions every 4 weeks over 18 months. A total of 1012 patients participated in EXPEDITION 1, EXPEDITION 2 enrolled another 1040 patients. Both studies were not able to show a difference in cognition and memory between the treated and the placebo group. However, a subgroup analysis of only patients with mild Alzheimer's disease showed less worsening of cognition in patients receiving solanezumab compared to placebo, which means the progression of the disease was slowed down. There was no effect on disease progression in patients with moderate symptoms. Since the first two EXPEDITION trials show a positive effect in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, Lilly launched another phase 3 trial, EXPEDITION 3 (NCT01900665). Patients with mild Alzheimer's disease received 400 mg solanezumab every 4 weeks for 80 weeks. Afterwards they can continue treatment for a total of 208 weeks, if wanted. This trial failed to show positive results, despite the high expectations. The trial will be finalized in 2020. The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer‚Äôs (A4) study is a phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate whether solanezumab can slow cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired older adults with elevated levels of amyloid Œ≤.

This was the 14th inauguration and marked the commencement of the only four-year term of both William Henry Harrison as President and John Tyler as Vice President. The presidential oath of office was administered to Harrison by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. Harrison died days into his term, the first U.S. president to die in office and has the shortest presidential term in American history. Tyler then succeeded to the presidency, creating precedence which would be followed seven more times before it was officially regulated through the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. Details Harrison's inauguration was marked by several novelties; he was the first president-elect to arrive in Washington, D.C. by train, and for the first time an official inaugural committee of citizens had formed to plan the day's parade and inaugural ball. At of age time of his inauguration, he was the oldest president-elect to take office until Ronald Reagan in 1981. Donald Trump would later be inaugurated when he was older than both men in 2017.

While most other members of its family feed on faeces, D. valgum is highly specialised for eating millipedes; such a transition from scavenger to carnivore is rare. D. valgum prefers live millipedes to dead ones, and seems to take no other food. It tends to kill millipedes much larger than itself, at long. The beetle itself is about long. In a typical attack, the beetle grasps the millipede's body with its mid and elongated, curved hind legs and then bites into the coiling prey at a joint between body segments. Sometimes this results in the prey being decapitated. The beetle then drags the victim to feed on it. D. valgum is widely distributed in Central American rainforests. Two subspecies are recognised: D. v. acropyge Bates, 1887 and D. v. longiceps Paulian, 1938.

He was an elected official in Wisconsin for nearly half a century. Biography =Early years= Frederic F. Heath was born September 6, 1864 to a Republican family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a young man, Heath worked variously as a teacher, a printer, a wood engraver, and an artist for wood engravers, the latter trades rendered largely obsolete by the invention of the linotype machine and the half-tone printing process. He moved to Chicago in 1886, moving to Florida in 1887 to publish a magazine called the Florida Fruit Grower. In 1888 he returned to his native Milwaukee, where he drew portraits and wrote editorials for the Milwaukee Daily Sentinel.Heath, Frederic, Socialism in America (cover title). Terre Haute, IN: Debs Publishing Co., 1900; pg. 113. =Socialist years= 1900 NEC members Heath later recalled that he had been won over to socialist ideas by Looking Backward, a popular utopian novel of Edward Bellamy published in 1888: > \\"I capitulated to it at once, and a few years later was the author of a > series of reports of the sessions of a mythical Bellamy club, in a Chicago > illustrated paper, of which I myself was editor, articles which afford me > amusing reading today, you may believe. By this time I had come to think > myself a socialist, yet kept on religiously voting for 'protection' of > American industry.\\"Frederic F. Heath, \\"How I Became a Socialist.\\" The > Comrade, v. 2, no. 7 (April 1903), pg. 154. Heath indicated that he was brought into the actual socialist movement through three influences: Julius Wayland and his newspaper The Coming Nation, forerunner to the Appeal to Reason; stray copies of literature produced by the Socialist Labor Party of America; and a direct acquaintance with Victor L. Berger, a former teacher who had become the editor of the German-language socialist daily newspaper in Milwaukee. Heath later wrote: > \\"The Milwaukee Socialist movement at that time was a large one, wholly > outside the SLP (which was regarded as too narrow and stagnating), and was > composed of German-Americans. The word got abroad among them that a Yankee > had turned Socialist, and they began to see the beginning of the end! The > great desire among the German Socialists in the country at that time was to > have Socialism become native to the soil; for they saw that there could be > no progress otherwise. To have the ice broken locally, therefore, by means > of a real descendant of Pilgrim New England, was no everyday matter ‚Äî so I > learned later.\\"Heath, \\"How I Became a Socialist,\\" pg. 155. Heath was a cartoonist who contributed his work to the socialist press. After being introduced to a regular meeting of German-American socialists by Berger as the \\"first Yankee Socialist in Milwaukee,\\" the gathering conducted the remainder of its proceedings in English.Marvin Wachman, History of the Social- Democratic Party of Milwaukee, 1897-1910. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1945; pg.12, fn. 26. Heath would remain close to Berger for the rest of Berger's life, crediting Berger with having played a great influence in mellowing the \\"fanaticism\\" of a \\"terribly academic\\" young convert to the socialist cause. Along with Berger and Eugene V. Debs, Heath helped to establish the Social Democracy of America in 1897, an organization which became the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) the following year, by way of a split of Berger's minority \\"political action\\" wing from the majority, who favored the establishment of a socialist colony. Heath was the chairman of the meeting of seceders at which the new party was formed.Heath,Socialism in America, pg. 113. Heath was elected a member of the National Executive Board of this new political party at its founding, a position that he continued to hold until the party dissolved itself in 1901 by merging with dissidents from the Socialist Labor Party headed by Morris Hillquit and Henry Slobodin to establish the Socialist Party of America. Heath played an active role in negotiating this unity as an official representative of the SDP during the previous year.Morris Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States. Revised 5th Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1910; pg. 305. Cover motiff of the paperback edition of Heath's Social Democracy Red Book. In 1900, Heath became one of the first historians of the Marxist movement in America when he authored a thin volume called Socialism in America (better known as Social Democracy Red Book).Heath, Frederic, Socialism in America (cover title). Terre Haute, IN: Debs Publishing Co., 1900. He wrote for (and later edited) the weekly newspaper of the SDP, the Social Democratic Herald, as well as producing material for other papers under various pen names.Heath, Socialism in America, pg. 113. The Social Democratic Herald was moved to Milwaukee in August 1901, with Heath taking over as editor, and was published continually there as a weekly until the launch of Victor Berger's daily, the Milwaukee Leader in December 1911.Wachman, History of the Social-Democratic Party of Milwaukee, 1897-1910, pg. 32. During the early 1920s, Heath was named editor of the Socialist Party's short-lived weekly newspaper based in Milwaukee, The New Day. Heath was a member of the International Typographical Union and a founder and director of the Milwaukee Ethical Society. From 1904 to 1906, Heath served as a Milwaukee alderman. He was sat on the Milwaukee Board of School DIrectors from 1909‚Äì1910 and was a County Supervisor from 1910 to 1948. Heath remained an active member of the Socialist Party throughout the greater part of the 1930s, attending the tumultuous 1937 party convention as a delegate from Wisconsin.Frederic Heath, \\"Exclusive Story of SP Convention Shows Collapse,\\" New Leader [New York], vol. 20, no. 14 (April 3, 1937), pp. 1-2. Heath found the experience amidst highly ideological factional warriors to be deeply disconcerting, later writing that \\"leering, victorious Communists\\" had made a \\"complete capture of the movement\\" ‚Äî an achievement \\"made possible by the arch-betrayer, Norman Thomas.\\" =Death and legacy= Frederic F.

He was one of the leading figures in the Nahda movement.Meisami and Starkey, 1998, p. 231 Like several of the principal players of the Arab Awakening (Nahda), Nasif al- Yaziji migrated from a Mount Lebanon ravaged by discord and revolt, to Beirut at a time when the city was undergoing rapid development and establishing itself as a centre of academia and journalism. A Greek Catholic,Moosa, 1997, p. 124 he began his career as a private secretary (mudabbir) - a common way for Christians to attain social mobility under the restrictive iqta' system by which Mount Lebanon, which he described as \\"a country of tribes\\", was governed. First employed by Prince Haydar al-Shihabi, he went on to work for Bashir Shihab II, whose brutal repression of his opponents earned him the title the \\"Red Emir\\". When Yaziji moved to Beirut in 1840, he became an Arabic tutor and it was in this role that he came into contact with American and British Protestant missionaries. He would help fulfil one of the greatest ambitions of the missionaries ‚Äì the translation of the Bible into Arabic ‚Äì when he corrected a translation that Eli Smith, an American missionary, and Butrus al-Bustani started in 1847. After that, he taught at the Syrian Protestant College (later renamed the American University of Beirut) and wrote on poetry, rhetoric, grammar and philosophy. It was for his attempts to emulate the style of classical Arab writers, thereby rediscovering the literary heritage of the Arabs, that he is best known. Among his works are a treatise on the muqata 'ji system. Used by the Ottomans to govern the emirate of Mount Lebanon, this involved tax-farming or iqta' rights being given to leading local families. These families enjoyed a degree of autonomy in the running of their region, controlled the land, collected taxes and benefitted from tax exemptions and benefits in exchange for providing the central authorities in Istanbul with revenue and armed men.Salibi, 2003, p. 110 With Bustani and Mikhail Mishaqa, al-Yaziji formed the Syrian Association for the Sciences and Arts ‚Äì the Arab world's first literary society ‚Äì in 1847. The circle tackled and published its deliberations on themes such as women's rights, history and their fight against superstition.Johnson, 2001, p. 138 It was dissolved in 1852 but its inner circle went on to establish the Syrian Scientific Association a few years later. This became a much larger, multi- sectarian society of intellectuals who pushed for Arab independence from the Ottomans.

The system meandered for 21 days in August‚ÄìSeptember 1986 between the South China Sea and far western tropical North Pacific Ocean, staying within the monsoon trough and causing heavy rains across the Philippines, Taiwan, southeast China, Hainan Island, and Vietnam. Its maximum sustained winds peaked at category two strength on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. Various signals were raised for Hong Kong three times due to Wayne's unusual track. A total of 490 perished, and the storm caused US $399 million (1986 US dollars) in damage. Meteorological history This system began its long life on August 16 in the South China Sea, having formed within the monsoon trough. It drifted to the southwest, then looped back to the northwest, becoming a tropical storm on August 18. Wayne, which remained embedded in the monsoon trough throughout its lifetime, turned to the northeast in response to a relocation of the trough, and became a typhoon according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on August 19, and on August 20 according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).JMA. RSMC Best Track Data (Text): 1986-1990. Retrieved on 2009-02-07. At 2 p.m. that day, the ship M. V. Fossarus recorded winds just west of its center. The typhoon came close but remained offshore of southeastern China, and after reaching maximum sustained winds of it hit western Taiwan on August 22. The building subtropical ridge forced Wayne west and southwestward through the Luzon Strait, where after weakening to a tropical storm it restrengthened briefly to a typhoon on August 24, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.JTWC(1987). Chapter 3: Northwest Pacific and North Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclones. United States Navy. Retrieved on 2007-12-19. The JMA did not upgrade Wayne back to a typhoon during this segment of Wayne's existence. Vertical shear caused Wayne to weaken to a depression on August 25 according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, and August 26 according to the JMA, as the cyclone began to rotate around the circulation of Vera to its north. Tropical Depression Wayne sped up to the northeast, but when Vera moved far enough away, Wayne drifted northeastward through the South China Sea, becoming a tropical storm again on August 27. Ridging to its north forced Wayne southward, where it again became a typhoon on August 30 according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, and August 31 according to the JMA. Wayne passed close to northern Luzon on September 2 as a typhoon, but turned back to the west. The JMA lowered Wayne back to a tropical storm on September 3 before restrengthening the cyclone back into a typhoon by early September 4. On September 4 while moving quickly westward through the South China Sea, Wayne reached a peak of winds according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, or winds according to the JMA, before it weakened due to land interaction. It hit northern Hainan on September 5 as an typhoon. Its center passed just north of Haikou, where pressure fell to . Wayne then entered the Gulf of Tonkin, and made its final landfall over Ha Nam Ninh in northern Vietnam later on that day, as a tropical storm. On September 6, Wayne dissipated over Vietnam/Laos border, after 85 JTWC advisories. The storm was one of the longest lasting Western Pacific tropical cyclones in recorded history. Preparations In Hong Kong, the Stand By Signal 1 was hoisted at 11:30 a.m. on August 19. As Wayne approached, the Strong Wind Signal 3 was raised at 11:00 a.m. on August 20. During its first approach, the Northeast Gale/Storm Signal 8 was issued at 10 p.m. on August 20. As winds relaxed, the Strong Wind Signal 3 replaced the Storm Signal 8 at 2 a.m. on August 21, with all signals lowered by 5 a.m. on August 21. During Wayne's second approach, the Stand By Signal 1 was raised at 11:45 a.m. on August 25. Signals were again lowered once Wayne moved farther away at 2:35 p.m. on August 26. During Wayne's third approach, the Stand By Signal 1 was hoisted at 1:30 a.m. on September 4. As Wayne continued its approach, the Strong Wind Signal 3 was raised at 3 p.m. the same day. Once Wayne moved away to the west of the area, signals were lowered for their final time at 2:10 p.m. on September 5. Impact During its passage of Taiwan, 63 died, 12,000 houses collapsed, and a thousand fishing vessels were wrecked. Total damage to the island reached US$360 million (1986 dollars). As a result of its consistent variance in track and drifting track, Wayne brought torrential rains through its path to the Philippines, Taiwan, southeastern China, Hainan Island, and Vietnam. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to at Tate's Cairn. During its various passages of Hong Kong, a total of of rainfall accumulated at Sai Kung. A total of of rainfall was recorded at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. Thirty-six perished in the Philippines.

Biography Carpenter was born in Wilmington, Delaware. He was three years old when his grandfather, R. R. M. Carpenter Sr., bought the Phillies in 1943 and gave control of the team to his father, Bob. He graduated from Yale University in 1962 where he earned two varsity football letters, and joined his father in the Phillies' front office in 1963. In 1965, he suggested that his father hire Paul Owens, a young scout, as farm system director. Owens would eventually become general manager in 1972. Ruly became team president at 32, when his father stepped down in the 1972 season. His tenure as owner was, statistically speaking, one of the most (if not the most) successful in franchise history. From 1976 to 1980, the Phillies won their division in every season but one, including the team's first World Series win in 1980. They also won the first half National League East title in the strike-shortened 1981 season. Soon after the World Series triumph, however, Carpenter decided to sell the team. With the advent of free agency, salaries were already starting to spiral upward, and he believed that even with his considerable wealth he needed to take on minority investors in order to stay afloat. Unwilling to have to get permission from partners in order to make major decisions, he sold the Phillies to a group headed by longtime Phillies executive Bill Giles for $32.5 million in 1981. By comparison, his grandfather had bought the team in 1943 for $400,000. Carpenter still lives in Wilmington. He is a longtime member of the University of Delaware Board of Trustees; his family has supported the school for many years. He is still an avid Phillies fan, and closely followed the team's run to its second world title in 2008. He was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.

It provides water service to over 21,000 customers in the northeast section of the Snohomish County. The utility is the second largest publicly owned utility in the Pacific Northwest and the 12th largest in the United States. It is the largest of 28 PUDs in the state of Washington. The PUD is the largest utility customer of the Bonneville Power Administration, a major wholesale marketer of energy in the Western United States. Clean energy projects Arlington Community Solar Project: In 2019, a 500 kilowatt solar project was installed in Arlington, Wa. The project consist of 1620 solar panels. Utility customers were offered the option of purchasing shares to cover the cost of construction and receive revenue for the sales of electricity to the utility. All shares were sold out quickly. At the time of completion it was the largest community solar project in Washington State. Hancock Creek Hydro Project: In 2018, the utility completed a run-of-the-river hydro project on Hancock Creek located in King County, Washington. The project is capable of generating 6 megawatts of electricity. Because the project is located upstream of Snoqualmie Falls, a natural barrier to migrating salmon, it poses no threat to salmon. Calligan Creek Hydro Project: in 2018, the utility completed a run-of-the-river hydro project on Calligan Creek located in King County, Washington. The project is capable of generating 6 megawatts of electricity. Because the project is located upstream of Snoqualmie Falls, a natural barrier to migrating salmon, it poses no threat to salmon. Tidal Energy: In 2007, the utility began to explore tidal energy;Overview,‚Äù in April 2009 the PUD selected OpenHydro,Selected,‚Äù a company based in Ireland, to develop turbines and equipment for eventual installation. The project as initially designed was to place generation equipment in areas of high tidal flow and operate that equipment for 4 to 5 years. After the trial period the equipment would be removed. The project was initially budgeted at a total cost of $10 million, with half of that funding provided by the PUD out of utility reserve funds, and half from grants, primarily from the US federal government. The PUD paid for a portion of this project with reserves and received a $900,000 grant in 2009 and a $3.5 million grant in 2010 in addition to using reserves to pay an estimated $4 million of costs. In 2010 the budget estimate was increased to $20 million, half to be paid by the utility, half by the federal government. The Utility was unable to control costs on this project, and by Oct of 2014 the costs had ballooned to an estimated $38 million and were projected to continue to increase. The PUD proposed that the federal government provide an additional $10 million towards this increased cost citing a \\"gentlemans agreement\\".‚ÄúPUD claims 'gentlemans agreement over tidal project funding',‚Äù Everett Herald, Oct 2, 2014 When the federal government refused to provide the additional funding the project was cancelled by the PUD after spending nearly $10 million in reserves and grants.

The design of the dam changed over time, with various designs proposed. Each design was studied at length. There was substantial resistance from the local community to this project, and landslides and unstable ground in the area of the proposed project complicated the process. The project was cancelled in 2018 with the utility citing lower electricity demand.

It started as a water utility on January 17, 1946. The PUD began operating as an electric utility on September 1, 1949. In 2005, the PUD uncovered audio tapes revealing that Enron energy traders were intentionally manipulating the market during the Western U.S. energy crisis by encouraging suppliers to shut down plants to perform unnecessary maintenance.\\"Tapes Show Enron Caused Rolling Blackouts in California,\\" New York Times, Feb. 4, 2005 PUD electricity supply 81.1% - Bonneville Power Administration 7.6% - PUD-owned Hydroelectric Projects 7.0% - Wind Energy Purchases 4.0% - Market Purchases 0.3% - Other (biogas, co-generation, solar & contracted small hydro)https://www.snopud.com/?p=1350 Bonneville Power Administration provides the bulk of the PUD's energy. BPA markets wholesale electricity from 31 federal hydroelectric projects in the Columbia River Basin, one non-federal nuclear plant and several other small non-federal plants. BPA, headquartered in Portland, Oregon, is a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Energy. The PUD purchases wind energy from the White Creek Wind Project in south central Washington, and the Wheat Field Wind Project,‚ÄúHorizon Wind Signs PPA with Snohomish PUD,‚Äù Renewable Energy World, Aug. 29, 2008 and the Hay Canyon Wind Project, both located in north central Oregon, along the Columbia River Gorge. The utility receives about 60 average-megawatts from these facilities. The PUD has five hydroelectric generating projects. The Henry M. Jackson Hydroelectric Project, which began operating in 1984, is the largest and is located in the Sultan River Basin. The hydroelectric generating facility produces about 5 percent of the PUD's power needs. In addition to generating enough power for 53,200 homes using a clean renewable resource, the project also provides recreation, enhances fish and wildlife habitats, provides an element of flood control and assures an abundance of clean drinking water. The utility has developed four additional small, low-impact hydroelectric facilities for energy generation in its service area (Youngs Creek Hydro, Woods Creek Hydro, Calligan Creek Hydro and Hancock Creek Hydro).‚ÄúNew hydroelectric dam to be first in county since ‚Äô80s,‚Äù Everett Daily Herald, May 24, 2010‚ÄúDam coming to Youngs Creek this summer,‚Äù Monroe Monitor, Jun. 15, 2010\\"PUD on the cutting edge of new electricity,\\" Komo 4 News, Dec. 30, 2010 The PUD also receives energy from a biomass project at the Hampton Lumber Mill in Darrington, Washington.

Pope John Paul II's political views were considered conservative on issues relating to reproduction and the ordination of women during his 26-year reign as pope of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign of Vatican City. A series of 129 lectures given by John Paul during his Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work entitled ‚ÄòTheology of the Body‚Äô, an extended meditation on the nature of human sexuality. He also extended it to condemnation of abortion, euthanasia and virtually all uses of capital punishment, calling them all a part of the \\"culture of death\\" that is pervasive in the modern world, advocating instead what he understood to be a \\"culture of life\\". He campaigned for world debt forgiveness and social justice.  Relations with dictatorships  In 1984 through \\"Instruction on Certain Aspects of the 'Theology of Liberation,'\\" and similar documents employing the voice of Cardinal Ratzinger, leader of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, John Paul II officially articulated his reservations about some forms of Liberation theology supplanting traditional Catholic doctrine. Liberation theology had many followers in South America. √ìscar Romero's attempt, during his visit to Europe, to obtain a Vatican condemnation of El Salvador's regime, denounced for violations of human rights and its support of death squads, was a failure. In his travel to Managua, Nicaragua in 1983, John Paul II harshly condemned what he dubbed the \\"popular Church\\" (i.e. \\"ecclesial base communities\\" (CEBs) supported by the CELAM), and the Nicaraguan clergy's tendencies to support the leftist Sandinistas, reminding the clergy of their duties of obedience to the Holy See. John Paul II was criticised for visiting Augusto Pinochet in Chile. He invited him to restore democracy, but, critics claim, not in as firm terms as the ones he used against communist regimes. John Paul also allegedly endorsed P√≠o Cardinal Laghi, who critics say supported the \\"Dirty War\\" in Argentina and was on friendly terms with the Argentine generals of the military dictatorship, allegedly playing regular tennis matches with general Jorge Rafael Videla. However, the Pope has been linked to the fall of Jean- Claude Duvalier's dictatorship in Haiti. He was also critical of the Chinese Communist regime and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association running the church and appointing bishops without the consent of the Holy See, and maintained strong ties with underground Catholic groups. The pope, who began his papacy when the Soviet regime controlled his native country of Poland, as well as the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, was a critic of Communism, and supported the Polish Solidarity movement. Former Soviet dictator Mikhail Gorbachev once said the collapse of the Iron Curtain would have been impossible without John Paul II. In later years, after having condemned Liberation theology, John Paul II criticised some of the more extreme versions of capitalism. \\"Unfortunately, not everything the West proposes as a theoretical vision or as a concrete lifestyle reflects Gospel values.\\" He saw in capitalism certain \\"viruses\\": indifferentism, hedonism, secularism, consumerism, practical materialism, and also formal atheism.  Jubilee 2000 campaign  In 2000 he publicly endorsed the Jubilee 2000 campaign on African debt relief fronted by Irish rock stars Bob Geldof and Bono. It was reported that during this period, U2's recording sessions were repeatedly interrupted by phone calls from the Pope, wanting to discuss the campaign with Bono.  Iraq war  In 2003 John Paul II also became a prominent critic of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. In his 2003 State of the World address the Pope declared his opposition to the invasion by stating, \\"No to war! War is not always inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity.\\"John Paul II, \\"Address to the Diplomatic Corps,\\" Vatican, 13 January 2003 (accessed 7 February 2007). He sent former Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States P√≠o Cardinal Laghi to talk with American President George W. Bush to express opposition to the war. John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of international law.  European Constitutional Treaty  In European Union negotiations for a new European Constitutional Treaty in 2003 and 2004, the Vatican's representatives failed to secure any mention of Europe's \\"Christian heritage\\"‚Äîone of the Pope's cherished goals.  Sexuality  While taking a traditional position on sexuality, defending the Church's moral opposition to marriage for same-sex couples, the pope asserted that persons with homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights as everybody else. In his last book, Memory and Identity, he referred to the \\"pressures\\" on the European Parliament to permit \\"homosexual 'marriage'\\". In the book, as quoted by Reuters, he wrote: ‚ÄúIt is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man.‚Äù The Pope also reaffirmed the Church's existing teaching on gender in relation to transsexuals, as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which he supervised, made clear that transsexuals can not serve in church positions.  Scientific theories and the interpretation of Genesis  In an address on 22 October 1996, to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Pope John Paul II reaffirmed the Church's openness to the theory of evolution: In the same address, the Pope rejected any theory of evolution that provides a materialistic explanation for the human soul: John Paul II also wrote to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on the subject of cosmology and how to interpret Genesis: References ;Notes * ","title":"Pope John Paul II's political views"},{"id":"21198605","text":"Igede is a language spoken in Benue State and Cross River State, Nigeria, by 250,000 people.

A major limestone quarry is worked on the southeastern side of the hill. An unexpected feature at this altitude is Merthyr Tydfil Golf Course which extends high onto the eastern and southern slopes of the hill.Ordnance Survey Explorer map OL12 'Brecon Beacons National Park: western area' Geology Western scree slopes of Cefn Cil Sanws The hill is composed of a layer cake of rocks of Carboniferous age all tilted moderately to the south. The summit is formed from Carboniferous Limestone whilst outcrops of Twrch Sandstone (formerly known as the 'Basal Grit' of the Millstone Grit Series) can be seen to the north and on its steep western flanks. There are sections of limestone pavement on the tilted plateau surface and small crags and pavements of gritstone to their south. The latter show evidence of glacial striations suggesting that the hill was over-ridden by ice moving southwards from the central Beacons during the ice ages.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 231 'Merthyr Tydfil' & accompanying memoir Plants Much of the hill is owned and managed by the Brecknock Wildlife Trust as a nature reserve.

He has been writing them since 1973. Nine volumes had been published as of 2017 (by Editio Musica Budapest). Volumes I, II, III, V, VI, VII and IX are for piano solo. Volumes IV and VIII are for piano 4-hands or two pianos. Volume I was essentially completed in 1973 but not published until 1979, by which time Volumes II, III and IV had also been composed. Volumes V and VI were published in 1997, Volume VII in 2003, Volume VIII in 2010, and Volume IX in 2017. Several pieces from the collection have started to be regularly performed, including a Prelude and Chorale, an Antiphon in F, and one called 3 in memoriam. Concept Kurt√°g began the composition of J√°t√©kok to try to recapture something of the spirit of a child's play. He started with a few ideas set out in the foreword to the first four volumes: Recordings * Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g: J√°t√©kok M√°rta Kurt√°g and Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g piano. With Bach transcriptions by Kurt√°g himself and his wife M√°rta. Recorded July 1996. ECM New Series 1619 (CD) * Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g: J√°t√©kok Valeria Szerv√°nszky and Ronald Cavaye. The first complete recording of volumes 1 - 4. Recorded October 1992. (4 CDs - available on iTunes, Amazon, CD Baby, etc.) Performances Tchaikovsky\\", parodying the opening of his First Piano Concerto. Kurt√°g uses special notation in some of the pieces. In the score above, the large black dots mean \\"play with both palms laid side by side\\". Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g and his wife M√°rta performed an always-renewing selection of pieces for two and four hands, including transcriptions. The later volumes of J√°t√©kok bear the sub-title Diary Entries and Personal Messages. This, to some extent, reveals the lineage of the unique microcosms, which irresistibly involve the listener at their recitals. The couple played a selection as part of the Composer's Portrait of the Rheingau Musik Festival, 8 August 2004, in the \\"Kulturforum Schillerplatz\\" (now \\"ESWE Atrium\\") in Wiesbaden. The Bach transcriptions, interspersed with the miniature character pieces, were Aus tiefer Not (BWV 687), Sonatina from Actus Tragicus, Trio sonata in E major (BWV 525) and O Lamm Gottes (BWV 618).

It is the fourteenth episode of the show's fifth season and aired on February 8, 2009. Plot Lynette and Tom are forced to sell his prized Ford Mustang to make ends meet after dealing with Porter's legal fees and fading business at the restaurant. Katherine assures her that everyone's in the same boat when Bree drives by to show off her new car, a hybrid Lexus LS. Lynette excuses herself and Katherine reveals that the Scavos are having money problems. \\"And here I am rubbing my fabulous new car in her face,\\" Bree says, \\"I feel awful. Thank God I didn't show her how it parks itself!\\" Bree gives Lynette a check for $20,000, saying she won't miss the money. Lynette won't accept the check but suggests that Bree buy into the restaurant. They shake hands on the deal. Lynette wants to throw a private party at Scavos' to honor their new partnership. Bree proposes having her latest book signing there, so the Scavos can \\"finally fill the place.\\" The book signing is underway before Bree learns that the Scavos are making recipes from her cookbook‚Äîwith pre-grated Parmesan cheese! She tosses the offending items and starts making her own. Lynette spies the tossed pizzas and Bree admits she wasn't comfortable having her recipe made with \\"substandard ingredients.\\" Lynette tears into Bree, saying that just because she got lucky, she shouldn't be lording it over her friends who are less fortunate. \\"I'm not the one who needs $20,000 to keep my business afloat,\\" insists Bree and Lynette snaps, \\"No, you're the one who's never going to let me forget it.\\" Lynette storms out‚Äîand accidentally runs into Bree's car. She pays Bree the damages out of her own pocket and swears to return the entire $20,000, with interest. \\"I don't want money to get in the way of our friendship,\\" Bree says and Lynette tells her, \\"Yeah, I think it's a little late for that.\\" After she leaves, Bree tears up the check. Susan is anxious to get M.J. into a prestigious private school, but can't afford the tuition. She pressures Mike for money but he insists he has none to spare. When Susan finds out that Mike just bought Katherine a stunning pearl necklace, she's furious, assuming that he's blowing what money he has on his new girlfriend. Susan sneaks into Katherine's house to steal the necklace, but Katherine catches her and runs after her, clad only in a towel. Katherine is shocked to hear that Mike bought her jewelry when he can't afford M.J.'s tuition. Both women confront Mike about the necklace and he is forced to admit he only spent $129 on it. \\"How dare you,\\" Mike says, laying into Susan for thinking he'd blow money on jewelry instead of his son. \\"I'm busting my ass, so if we're falling short, it's not because of me,\\" he says angrily. She goes back to the private school and offers to sign on as an art teacher, since faculty members receive a fifty percent discount. She makes such a heartfelt plea that they hire her as an assistant, even though she's overqualified for the job. Carlos gets a huge bonus at work and wants to celebrate by taking Gaby out to the priciest restaurant in town. She's going to wear the dress from the night Carlos proposed (the dress worn in this episode actually matches the dress that was shown in the pilot episode when a scene of Carlos proposing to Gaby for the first time is shown) and when he scoffs whether she can still fit into it, she is insulted that he hasn't noticed how hard she's been working to get back in shape. To lick those last few pounds, she asks Edie about the fitness boot camp she's just joined. Edie is skeptical that Gaby is tough enough for the workout, as is the instructor, an Israeli ex-soldier who makes his clients sign a contract forbidding them to use words like \\"can't\\", \\"doughnut\\", \\"cake\\" and \\"tired\\". The workout is indeed far too intense for Gaby, who quits after the first session. She learns there's no quitting when the entire class shows up in her front yard the next day. She announces she's going back to sleep, but Edie chews her out by telling her that it was the women's idea to show up, since Gaby wanted to fit into that dress so badly. \\"You wanted the old Gaby back? Well, you got her. A self-centered, obnoxious jerk,\\" says a disgusted Edie. A humbled Gaby rejoins the class. Gaby models the old dress, which now fits perfectly. When her seamstress, Jean, tells her she looks like she hasn't changed at all, Gaby thanks her for all her help over the years. Dave, Bob, and Lee comfort Tom about the loss of his car. Tom complains that the pizzeria is suffering because people still suspect Porter of having torched the nightclub. Dave reassures Tom, saying he knows Porter didn't do it. But, as Bob later tells Lee, he's read the police reports and Dave was the only witness to directly implicate Porter in the fire. \\"Porter wasn't even in the building.\\" Lee wants to tell Tom and Lynette, but Bob says since the charges have been dropped, \\"It's no longer our business. Besides, there's something about that Dave guy that scares me.\\" Edie asks Dave what the biggest difference is between being married to her and to his first wife. \\"Honestly, our marriage is more real,\\" he tells her. Reassured, she asks him how, and he relates that his first marriage was \\"like a fairy-tale,\\" one he thought would last forever. \\"Love is just temporary. The way the fairy tale ends is death,\\" he says, making her wish she hadn't asked. At the book signing, Lee watches in disbelief as Dave congratulates Tom on the restaurant's booming business. Lee grabs Tom and tells him the truth about Dave. Tom goes to Dave's house and punches him out, saying, \\"You nearly destroyed our family!\\" Dave desperately offers to make it up to him, insisting that they're friends, but Tom, who is unnerved by the death grip that Dave had on him moments ago, says, \\"That's what I thought. But I don't know who you are.\\" Notes * The title comes from the song \\"Children and Art\\" written by Stephen Sondheim for the musical Sunday in the Park with George. * Due to the one episode narrated by Rex Van de Kamp (Steven Culp, \\"My Husband, the Pig\\"), this is the 100th episode that has been narrated by Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong). * Although credited, Shawn Pyfrom (Andrew Van de Kamp), Kyle MacLachlan (Orson Hodge), Charlie Carver (Porter Scavo), Max Carver (Preston Scavo), and Kendall Applegate (Penny Scavo) do not appear in this episode.

Young Life He spent his early years growing up in Jaffa, Palestine and Acre, Palestine before attending American University in Beirut, where he graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy. He then traveled to study at the University of Chicago, where he completed an M.A. in Philosophy in 1949. Politically active from a young age, Sharabi then returned to serve as editor of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party‚Äôs monthly magazine al-Jil al- Jadid (The New Generation). Forced to flee to Jordan after the parties disbanding in 1949, Sharabi returned to the United States where he completed a Ph.D. in the history of culture, again at the University at Chicago. That same year, he began to teach at Georgetown University, where he gained full professorship in eleven years. Controversy Dr. Sharabi, while an ardent supporter of Palestinian rights, was not beyond criticizing the Palestinian governing bodies. According to a story in the Washington Post, \\"In 1999, after PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ordered the arrests of 11 Palestinian academics who had accused his administration of 'tyranny and corruption,' Dr. Sharabi, along with Edward Said of Columbia University, signed a letter calling the arrests 'a totally unjustifiable attack on the freedom of expression.'\\" Nine of the lawmakers were immune from arrest, but two later accused the Palestinian police of attacking them.[5] Legacy He worked tirelessly to promote understanding of the Arab culture, establishing in 1973, along with several other colleagues, the Georgetown Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. In 1977, Georgetown University ‚Äúawarded Dr. Sharabi the Umar Al-Mukhtar Chair in Arab Culture in recognition of his distinguished intellectual contributions and his efforts to promote Arab studies.[2]‚Äù Dr. Sharabi formed, later that same year, the Jerusalem Fund for Education and Community Development, an organization that worked on educational, cultural and health issues of Palestinians.

Portmarnock is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock in the historic County Dublin.Placenames Database of Ireland - Portmarnock civil parish, logainm.ie; accessed 11 March 2017. In the 2002 census the population was 8,975 and by 2011 had climbed to 9,285. Location Portmarnock lies on the coast between Malahide and Baldoyle. Portmarnock could also be said to border, at sea, Sutton and perhaps Howth in the form of Ireland's Eye. Its major beach, the Velvet Strand, is monitored by a lifeguard during the summer season from early April to the start of October. =Velvet Strand, Portmarnock beach= Kites in the sky on Portmarnock beach Adjacent to Portmarnock is a narrow beach which extends onto a sandy peninsula with beaches on all sides. Portmarnock's beach is nicknamed the Velvet Strand due to the smooth sand along the beach, and is popular with wind- and kite-surfers. Southern Cross monument The beach was the starting point for two important pioneering flights. On 23 June 1930 Australian aviator Charles Kingsford Smith and his crew took off in the Southern Cross on the second westbound transatlantic flight (to Newfoundland), after which they continued on to Oakland, California, completing a circumnavigation of the world. The first solo westbound transatlantic flight began from Portmarnock beach when Jim Mollison, a British pilot, took off in a de Havilland Puss Moth on 18 August 1932 bound for Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick, Canada. The sculpture Eccentric Orbit (by Rachel Joynt and Remco de Fouw, erected 2002) on the seafront is of limestone, bronze and stainless steel. The needle points to the North Star, an age-old navigation point. The sculpture commemorates the epic flights of the Southern Cross (the second non-stop east-west North Atlantic flight, in 1930), the Heart's Content (the first east-west non-stop solo North Atlantic flight, 1932) and the abandoned solo North-Atlantic flight of Faith in Australia (1933). Portmarnock is home to one of the 29 Napoleonic Martello Towers in the Greater Dublin Area. Etymology and history The district's name derives from the Irish word port ‚Äì meaning \\"port\\" ‚Äì and Saint Marnoch or Mernoc, said to have arrived in what is now Portmarnock in the 5th century AD. The area had been settled in Neolithic times, as evidenced by flints and other tools excavated on the northern fringe of Portmarnock and the remains of a ring fort visible from the air at the south of the town. The son of Queen Maedhbh of Connaught ‚Äì Maine ‚Äì is also said to have been buried locally. Transport Portmarnock is on the northern commuter railway line out of Dublin (also the Dublin‚ÄìBelfast line); Portmarnock railway station, opened on 25 May 1844, is now on the DART network.See rail transport in Ireland for more. The village is served by Dublin Bus routes 102, 32, 32X, 42, 42N (Nitelink) and 142. Owing to its proximity to Dublin city, it is a form of dormitory village north- northeast of the city centre. Education There are two primary schools ‚Äì St. Marnock's and St. Helen's ‚Äì and also a secondary school, Portmarnock Community School. Religion Portmarnock has a Roman Catholic parish and church. Sport Portmarnock is famous for the world-class golf course at Portmarnock Golf Club, which formally opened on 26 December 1894. Occupying much of the sandy peninsula to the south of the village, the club has hosted many golf tournaments, including the 1960 Canada Cup (now known as the World Cup), the 1991 Walker Cup and the Irish Open on many occasions. Another links course, part of the Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links complex, that opened in the 1990s, was designed by German golfer Bernhard Langer. That golfing hotel is built around St. Marnock's, the former home of a branch of the Jameson distilling family, which had its own private golf course. St. Marnock's was largely built in the late 1890s to the designs of British architect Sir Robert Lorimer. Naomh Mearn√≥g is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Other local sports clubs include Portmarnock Tennis Club, Portmarnock A.F.C., AUL Premier A side Seaview Celtic F.C., and the Portmarnock Sport & Leisure Club which encompasses 16 sporting activities and holds a swimming pool with some public access hours. Portmarnock Pitch & Putt Club was founded in 1958 and moved to its current location in 1961. It has been affiliated to the Pitch and Putt Union of Ireland since its foundation in 1961 and is currently a members- only club with 250 adult and 55 under-16 members. Representation Portmarnock lies in the Dublin Fingal D√°il constituency and in the modern administrative county of Fingal. Before 2016 it was in the Dublin North-East constituency.

He was one of the founding members of My Darling Murder, a metal band formed with friends Andy Gerold (former touring bassist for Marilyn Manson) and Tim Kelleher (former touring bassist for Thirty Seconds to Mars). My Darling Murder broke up in 2006, according to a statement released by the band itself, and in the fall of that year, Mallin joined Kill Hannah on the road as their touring drummer. He has since mid-2007 been featured in interviews, photo shoots, and press as a full member of Kill Hannah. Although a full-time member in Kill Hannah, Mallin has also been performing as the live drummer for Kesha since her Spring 2010 appearance on Saturday Night Live. He also performed as the hired gun in Hollywood Undead from late 2009‚Äì2010 before joining Kesha forever. Mallin, Gerold, and Kelleher reformed My Darling Murder, with singer Jared Woosely. They recorded an EP with producer Sean Beavan in early 2011. The Ep was never officially released. In 2012 Mallin joined platinum selling rock band Filter for a short stint along with super group Fear and the Nervous System (led by James \\"Munky\\" Schaffer from Korn).

Heritage Lottery funding helped the Trust to expand and a bequest of ¬£1,000,000 in 2003 resulted in the appointment of a Reserves Officer. In April 2018 it merged with The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales. The offices of the Trust are located in Lion House, Brecon. The Trust has 22 reserves, the majority of which are in the Brecon Beacons National Park. All are open to the public free of charge. The most visited of the reserves is at Pwll-y-Wrach (\\"Witches' Pool\\", near Talgarth; the site is 17.5 hectares in area, most of which is woodland. At the eastern end of the reserve is a waterfall flowing from the River Enig into the so-called Witches' Pool. The wildlife in this area includes bluebells, woodruff, orchids, herb paris, toothwort, dormice and dippers (which frequent the waterfall). Another reserve run by the Trust, Glasbury Cutting, is located at Glasbury-on-Wye, in the far east of the Trust's administrative area. Formerly part of the railway line between Brecon and Hereford, which closed in 1962, it is composed partly of woodland and partly of a meadow created to encourage wild plants. Dormice, a protected species, were discovered within the reserve in 2000. In the far south-west, Cae Lynden Nature Reserve is one of three reserves close together near Ystradgynlais. The grasslands of this former sports field encourage marsh fritillary, meadow brown and gatekeeper butterflies. Vicarage Meadows, a grassland reserve near Abergwesyn in the Irfon Valley, is managed by the Trust and the species growing there include bog asphodel, wood bitter vetch, greater butterfly orchids and small white orchids. In March 2016, the Brecknock Wildlife Trust announced a new initiative in the Ystradgynlais area, called the Wild Communities Project. This is intended to capitalise on the results of an earlier project, the ‚ÄúUpper Tawe Valley Living Landscape Project\\". Lottery funding of ¬£313,757 has been allocated to this project, which will take place over a three-year period.

He married Margaret Ann (n√©e Jones) (1878‚Äì1946) on 31 December 1893, and had five children with her: William James Seddon (b. 1894); Margaret Seddon (b. 1896); Frederick Henry Seddon Jr (b. 1897); Ada Seddon (b. 1905), and Lilian Louisa Agnes Emma Seddon (b. 1911).\\"Murder in Mind\\" p. 1466 His father also lived with him. The names of William and Frederick Seddon appear in the visitors' book for the Metropolitan Police Crime Museum on 1 December 1905; the museum was not open to the general public and the reason for their visit is unknown. At one time Seddon had been a Freemason, being initiated into Liverpool's Stanley Lodge No. 1325 in 1901. He resigned a year later to move south. In 1905 he is named as a founding petitioner of Stephens Lodge No. 3089 at Bourne End, Buckinghamshire. He resigned from both lodges in 1906. In 1909, Seddon bought a fourteen-room house at 63 Tollington Park, near London's Finsbury Park areaWilliamson, Bernard (Summer 2003). Murder and Masonry.Freemasonry Today, Issue 25. Retrieved on 30 January 2009. and worked as a Superintendent of Collectors for a national insurance company. He had an obsession with making money; he ran a second-hand clothes business in his wife's name and also speculated in real estate. At some stage he had the idea of swindling another person, so he and his wife advertised to let out the second floor of their London home. A near-neighbour, Eliza Mary Barrow (1863-1911), a 47-year- old somewhat eccentric spinster responded to this advertisement, moving in with her ward Ernest George Grant, the eight-year-old orphaned son of her friend, on 26 July 1910.\\"Murder in Mind\\" p. 1465 Previously, she had shared lodgings with her cousin, Frank Vonderahe, but she apparently hoped the new arrangement with Seddon would be cheaper. Murder Eliza Barrow Being easily led, and as keen on making money as Seddon was himself, Barrow was quickly persuaded by Seddon to sign over to him a controlling interest in all her savings and annuities, including ¬£1,500 of India Stock, in return for which he would take care of her for the rest of her life, giving her a small annuity and allowing her to live in his home rent free. In August 1911, the Seddons, Barrow, and her young ward went on holiday together to Southend. On their return, Seddon's daughter Maggie was sent to buy a threepenny packet of flypaper from the local chemist.\\"Murder in Mind\\" p. 1467 Shortly after, Barrow began to suffer from agonising stomach pains. The local doctor was called, who prescribed bismuth and morphine. On 9 September he visited her again, but by the following Monday her condition had deteriorated. However, she refused to go to hospital. She improved slightly for a few days, but was confined to her bed where, on 13 September, she made a will, dictated to and executed by Seddon, and witnessed by his relatives. At 6:15 on the morning of 14 September, while being looked after by Mrs. Seddon, Barrow died.\\"Murder in Mind\\" p. 1468 Seddon went to the doctor, who issued a death certificate without seeing the body, claiming that he was unable to attend due to overwork brought on by an epidemic current in the area at that time. On 15 September, Seddon went to the undertaker and arranged a cheap funeral, keeping the small commission for himself. Barrow's burial took place in a common burial plot, although her family had a vault in Islington. Seddon's later explanation for this was that Barrow's family had snubbed his daughter during an earlier visit and he was not prepared to allow his family to be treated in the same way again, and that if Barrow's family missed the funeral it might teach them better manners for the future.'The Lower Middle Class in Britain, 1870‚Äì1914' Edited by Geoffrey Crossick Published by Palgrave Macmillan (1977) pg 80 Immediately after the funeral the Seddon family left for Southend for a fortnight's holiday. Barrow's cousin, Frank Vonderahe, suspicious over the suddenness of the death and how quickly the funeral arrangements had been made, arrived to take over possession of her estate. However, Seddon informed him that nothing was left as he had paid the substantial funeral expenses and the cost of Ernest Grant's upkeep himself. The Vonderahe family then went to the police and voiced their suspicions. Barrow's body was exhumed on 15 November 1911, and an examination of it by Sir William Willicox, the senior Home Office specialist, and young pathologist Bernard Spilsbury, who had already made a name for himself in the Crippen case, discovered about two grains of arsenic.'Criminal Poisoning: Investigational Guide for Law Enforcement, Toxicologists, Forensic Scientists, And Attorneys' by John Harris Trestrail Published by Humana Press (2007) pg 13 As in the Crippen trial, Spilsbury showed himself to be an outstanding witness for the prosecution, easily dealing with cross-examination by the junior defence barrister and demonstrating highly effective forensic techniques.Andrew Rose, Lethal Witness, Sutton Publishing 2007, Kent State University Press 2009, pp30-40 Trial and execution Sketch by William Hartley of Seddon and his wife in the dock at the Old Bailey (Crime Museum) Seddon and his wife became the chief suspects in what was by now a murder inquiry. During their trial at the Old Bailey the prosecution, led by the Attorney General, Sir Rufus Isaacs, proved that Margaret Seddon had previously bought a large amount of flypaper, which contained arsenic. The prosecution suggested that the poison used to kill Barrow had been obtained by soaking the flypaper in water. The renowned barrister Edward Marshall Hall led for the defence. He strongly resisted all claims that Barrow had been poisoned, claiming instead that she had died by taking a medical preparation containing arsenic. Despite the advice given by his Counsel, Seddon insisted on giving evidence in his own defence;\\"Murder in Mind\\" p. 1474 it was claimed that he turned the jury against himself through his arrogant and condescending attitude. Certainly, his case was not helped by his ridiculous claim that Barrow might have drunk water from the dishes of flypaper that had been placed in her room to keep away the flies. Despite a fierce battle from the defence team, the jury took just one hour to find him guilty. Margaret Seddon was acquitted of any involvement in the murder. Marshall Hall always maintained that Seddon would have been acquitted had he not insisted on giving evidence, and on at least one occasion used it as an example in warning a client of the risks of giving evidence in one's own defence. Mr Justice Bucknill; the only known photograph of the death sentence being passed in an English court A former Freemason,Beresiner, Yasha (16 January 2006). Sherlock Holmes incarnate. MQ Magazine. Retrieved on 30 January 2009. on being asked by the Clerk of the Court if he had anything to say as to why the sentence of death should not be passed against him, Seddon replied at length and appealed directly to the judge, Sir Thomas Townsend Bucknill, as a brother Mason and in the name of 'The Great Architect Of The Universe' to overturn the jury's guilty verdict. According to some sources he gave the First Degree sign, according to others the Sign of Grief and Distress, begging for mercy. The judge is reported as having said, with some emotion: Seddon replied that he had already made his peace with his Maker.\\"Murder in Mind\\" p. 1475 Mr Justice Bucknill then pronounced the sentence of death. Bernard Spilsbury, who went on to become a famous pathologist and who gave evidence during the trial, was not yet involved in Freemasonry,Andrew Rose op cit p80 and so the meaning of what had passed between Seddon and Bucknill was lost on him at the time. However, his colleagues who also provided forensic evidence were Masons, and they were aware of its significance. Seddon was hanged by John Ellis and Thomas Pierrepoint at Pentonville Prison on 18 April 1912.Adam H L, 'Notable British Trials' Published by Wm. Hodge & Co., London (1913) After his execution his widow, Margaret Ann Seddon, returned to Liverpool where she married James Donald Cameron on 4 November 1912, less than 7 months after her husband's execution. Later she moved with Cameron to the United States, taking her five children with her.Margaret Ann Seddon on Ancestry.co.uk Portrayals In the 1957 play A Dead Secret by Rodney Ackland, the character of Seddon under the name of Frederick Dyson, was played by Paul Scofield. On 12 April 1959, the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents aired an episode, \\"Waxwork\\", which depicted Seddon as one of six murderers in a wax museum's murderer's row.\\"Waxwork\\" on the Internet Movie Database In the 1981 episode of the television series Ladykillers Michael Jayston played Seddon in an episode entitled \\"Root of All Evil\\".Lady Killers on the Internet Movie Database On 21 July 2007, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play by John Fletcher based on the murder of Mrs Barrow, entitled The Shocking Tale of Margaret Seddon, which took the premise that Frederick's wife Margaret had planned and committed the crime.The Shocking Tale of Margaret Seddon The case was reevaluated using modern forensic techniques in an episode of the BBC series Murder, Mystery and My Family (2020) which reinvestigated the evidence against Seddon. Judge David Radford found Seddon's conviction to have been safe.

Whitechapel foundry owner The Entrance to the Whitechapel Bell Foundry on Whitechapel Rd. Little is known of Phelps before he became owner of Whitechapel. He took over the foundry on the death of the former foundry owner James Bartlett in January, 1701. Phelps remained as the head of the foundry for thirty-seven years, during which time the business grew to be the most successful in the kingdom. The bells that the foundry made were installed in many locations across England. Among his most well-known bells used to be hung in the steeples of St Michael-upon-Cornhill; St Magnus the Martyr; All Hallows, Lombard Street; St Andrew, Holborn; and Cambridge (Great St Mary's), and there is still a bell at St Paul's Cathedral. It was customary for bell-founders to add an inscription to their bells. Phelps‚Äô inscriptions were typically much longer than his predecessors. For example, the following inscription used to appear on the tenth bell of St Michael-upon-Cornhill until it was recast in 2011: The Whitechapel foundry was very prosperous under the ownership of Richard Phelps. Lukis cites the inscription on the tenor bell at Avebury, Wilts, Richard Phelps, London, Nat. par. hujus 1719 as indicating Phelps was born there. Bells for St Paul's Cathedral The South West Tower of St Paul's Cathedral, London, containing Great Paul (Bourdon), Great Tom (hour bell), and two quarter jacks Phelps‚Äô most famous bell is Great Tom at St Paul's Cathedral in London, England. The history of this bell began long before Phelps‚Äô involvement with it. In 1698, King William III gave the bells from St Stephen's Chapel to the newly rebuilt St Paul‚Äôs. The largest of these bells was originally called Edward I or Edward of Westminster, and was later known as Great Tom of Westminster. The name \\"Great Tom\\" is thought to be a corruption of grand ton, referencing its deep, sonorous tone. It then weighed . In 1699, while the bell was being moved to St Paul‚Äôs, it fell off its carriage and was cracked. Bell Yard at Temple Bar received its name from this event. The bell remained in a shed in the yard of St Paul's Cathedral until 1708 when it was recast by Philip Wightman at a weight of approximately and hung in the south west tower. The recasting was a failure. In 1709, Richard Phelps cast a new bell, which was delivered to the Cathedral before the old one was taken away, but the new bell also failed. Nine years later Phelps was given the job of recasting it once again. The present bell is described by Phelps‚Äô successors Charles and George Mears as being in diameter, , and with thickness at sound bow , and weighing . The larger part of the metal of which it is made came from Great Tom of Westminster. It bears the inscription: The bell, which hangs in the South West Tower of the cathedral is ‚Äúonly used for tolling the hour, and for tolling at the death and funeral of a member of the royal family, the Bishop of London, the Dean of the Cathedral, or the Lord Mayor‚Äù. An exception was made for the death of American President James Garfield. In 1717, Richard Phelps cast two more bells that were added as quarter jacks. Still in use today, the first weighs , is in diameter and is tuned to A flat; the second weighs and is in diameter and is tuned to E flat. Other churches He cast a large number of bells for London churches, including the tenor bell at St Margaret's Church in West Hoathly, West Sussex, which is inscribed: On 5 September 1726, Richard Phelps and church wardens James Smith and Charles Ball of St Dionis Backchurch reached an agreement for a set of eight new bells and frames. Included in the deal was the exchange of the old bells. The agreement was later amended to include two more bells and frames. The bells at St Magnus the Martyr, London Bridge were formed a ring of ten with a tenor of . Succeeding a ring of five, the back eight were cast in 1714 by Richard Phelps, ten years after the spire was built, and the trebles very soon after. These bells were scrapped in 1976. Last bell cast The last bell bearing Phelps‚Äô name was the priests‚Äô bell at St George's Cathedral, Southwark in Southwark, inscribed: Phelps died in 1738, and the order for this bell was completed by his foreman Thomas Lester, to whom he bequeathed his business and the lease of the foundry.

Generally, the PAS domain acts as a molecular sensor, whereby small molecules and other proteins associate via binding of the PAS domain. Due to this sensing capability, the PAS domain has been shown as the key structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions of the circadian clock, and it is also a common motif found in signaling proteins, where it functions as a signaling sensor.  Discovery  PAS domains are found in a large number of organisms from bacteria to mammals. The PAS domain was named after the three proteins in which it was first discovered: * Per ‚Äì period circadian protein * Arnt ‚Äì aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein * Sim ‚Äì single- minded protein Since the initial discovery of the PAS domain, a large quantity of PAS domain binding sites have been discovered in bacteria and eukaryotes. A subset called PAS LOV proteins are responsive to oxygen, light and voltage.  Structure  Although the PAS domain exhibits a degree of sequence variability, the three-dimensional structure of the PAS domain core is broadly conserved. This core consists of a five-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet and several Œ±-helices. Structural changes, as a result of signaling, predominantly originate within the Œ≤-sheet. These signals propagate via the Œ±-helices of the core to the covalently-attached effector domain. In 1998, the PAS domain core architecture was first characterized in the structure of photoactive yellow protein (PYP) from Halorhodospira halophila. In many proteins, a dimer of PAS domains is required, whereby one binds a ligand and the other mediates interactions with other proteins.  Examples of PAS in organisms  The PAS domains that are known share less than 20% average pairwise sequence identity, meaning they are surprisingly dissimilar. PAS domains are frequently found on proteins with other environmental sensing mechanisms. Also, many PAS domains are attached to photoreceptive cells. = Bacteria = Often in the bacterial kingdom, PAS domains are positioned at the amino terminus of signaling proteins such as sensor histidine kinases, cyclic-di-GMP synthases and hydrolases, and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. = Neurospora = In the presence of light, White Collar-1 (WC-1) and White Collar-2 (WC-2) dimerizes via mediation by the PAS domains, which activates translation of FRQ. = Drosophila = In the presence of light, CLK and CYC attach via a PAS domain, activating the translation of PER, which then associates to Tim via the PER PAS domain. The following genes contain PAS binding domains: PER, Tim, CLK, CYC. = Arabidopsis = A PAS domain is found in the ZTL and NPH1 genes. These domains are very similar to the PAS domain found in the Neurospora circadian-associated protein WC-1. = Mammals = The circadian clock that is currently understood for mammals begins when light activates BMAL1 and CLK to bind via their PAS domains. That activator complex regulates Per1, Per2, and Per3 which all have PAS domains that are used to bind to cryptochromes 1 and 2 (CRY 1,2 family). The following mammalian genes contain PAS binding domains: Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, Cry2, Bmal, Clk, Pasd1.  Other mammalian PAS roles  Within Mammals, both PAS domains play important roles. PAS A is responsible for the protein-protein interactions with other PAS domain proteins, while PAS B has a more versatile role. It mediates interactions with chaperonins and other small molecules like dioxin, but PAS B domains in NPAS2, a homolog of the Drosophila clk gene, and the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) also help to mediate ligand binding. Furthermore, PAS domains containing the NPAS2 protein have been shown to be a substitute for the Clock gene in mutant mice who lack the Clock gene completely. The PAS domain also directly interacts with BHLH. It is typically located on the C-Terminus of the BHLH protein. PAS domains containing BHLH proteins form a BHLH-Pas protein, typically found and encoded in HIF, which require both the PAS domain and BHLH domain and the Clock gene.

The Bishkek Protocol is a provisional ceasefire agreement, signed by the representatives of Armenia (Parliament Speaker Babken Ararktsian), the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (Parliament Speaker Karen Baburyan), Azerbaijan (First Deputy Parliament Speaker Afiyaddin Jalilov) and Russia's representative to the OSCE Minsk Group Vladimir Kazimirov on May 5, 1994 in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. Background Bishkek was proposed by Kyrgyz representative Medetkhan Sheremkulov who was head of negotiating group, and offered to proceed discussions in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan after the first meeting between parliamentarians of Azerbaijan and Armenia on ceasing fire in Nagorno-Karabakh was held in Mariehamn. Talks between Azerbaijani and Armenian delegations continued for hours. A representative of Azerbaijan Afiyaddin Jalilov questioned the legitimacy of the participation of Armenians who lived in Karabakh, and required to include the name of Nizami Bakhmanov, a member of his delegation who was the mayor of Shusha in Nagorno-Karabakh in the protocol. The protocol and these points were a subject of discussions between President Heydar Aliyev and Kazimirov where it was agreed to include signature of Nizami Bakhmanov into the protocol. Vladimir Kazimirov stated the following in his memoirs: \\"Aliyev agreed. At the end of the page, two alterations were written in a legible handwriting in Russian. The name of N.

The film was adapted by Marina and Sergey Dyachenko from the 1969 novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky of the same Russian name, published in English as Prisoners of Power; a part of the Noon Universe series. It is a dystopian story set on post-apocalyptic planet Saraksh, ruled by a totalitarian regime that brainwashes its citizens. Maxim Kammerer, a space explorer from Earth, crash-lands on Saraksh and becomes involved in the planet's everboiling politics. The movie was released as two separate films, in December 2008 and April 2009, respectively. The film was met with mixed reviews. It was praised for its visual style, social commentary and being faithful to the original novel, but also criticized for its direction, editing, and casting. Dark Planet was made with one of the largest budgets for Russian cinema at the time (it remains the most expensive Russian science fiction film ever), and despite huge box office earnings and DVD sales the movie was considered a financial disappointment. Plot summary = Part I = Year 2157. Maxim Kammerer (Stepanov), a space explorer from Earth, crash lands on an unknown planet. His ship is destroyed, and now he's stuck there \\"like Robinson on an uninhabited island\\" (hence the title). Maxim encounters local military police, who do not believe Maxim is alien and send him to mental hospital in the capital. Guy Gaal (Fyodorov), a corporal of the Guards, is assigned to escort Maxim. Maxim learns that the name of the planet is Saraksh, and the country where he landed is called Fatherland, because it is ruled by a militaristic dictatorship of the Unknown Fathers. Strider (Serebryakov), a powerful figure in the government, wants to see the newcomer; he sends one of his men, Funk, after Maxim, but as they drive the street, Funk suffers from what seems to be an epileptic seizure, and Maxim is left alone. He encounters Rada Gaal (Snigir), the sister of Guy, falls in love with her and stays with the Gaals. Guy talks Maxim into becoming a privateer (\\"candidate\\") in the Guards. They are forced to participate in brutal raids against the people called \\"degenerates\\" by state propaganda. After Maxim refuses to execute a group of captured \\"degenerates\\", Guards commander Rittmeister Chachu shoots him and leaves him to his apparent death. However, Maxim survives and joins a group of rebel \\"degenerates\\". During his time with the rebels, Maxim learns the true nature of the regime and the purpose of towers erected across the country. Contrary to state propaganda, the towers function as mind control devices, sending a special kind of radiation that ensures the citizens' loyalty to the regime. Twice in a day, the majority of people experience a patriotic frenzy, while minority, the \\"degenerates\\", are able to resist brainwashing, but they suffer from intense pain and convulsions. The Unknown Fathers themselves are known to be \\"degenerates\\" (this is highlighted by Funk's \\"epilepsy\\" earlier). Maxim realises that rebels are hiding the truth just as the government does, in hope that they might use the towers themselves, had they come to power. After fighting alongside the \\"degenerates\\" in the attack on a tower, Maxim is again captured by the military and sentenced to a prison labor camp. There, inmates are tasked with cleaning the wilderness of automated defense systems that were left abandoned by decades of war. On a mission, Maxim manages to capture a mechanized tank. He drives the tank away from detention zone across the minefield, picks up Guy, and heads south to the neighbouring nations. = Part II = The second part is named Rebellion (). It starts with a brief description of the first part plot. Maxim reveals the true purpose of the towers to Guy, who does not believe at first but is convinced when his enthusiasm fades as they get farther from the towers. They arrive in a city ruined by atomic bombing and inhabited by mutants. Maxim tries to convince mutants to start a rebellion against the Unknown Fathers, but, being too weak, they refuse. Maxim then decides to seek help from another powerful country on Saraksh, the Islands Empire. Mutants give Maxim a bomber airship to fly for the Empire. As Guy and Maxim travel the airship, Guy is again hit by the towers' radiation. He starts hysterically screaming of his loyalty to Maxim and hugging him. To stop it, Maxim collides the airship into the Tower and destroys it. After crash-landing at the shore, Maxim and Guy discover an abandoned Imperial White Submarine. There, they find evidence that Islands Empire is even worse mass-murdering fascist regime which would not help their goals. Meanwhile, the Unknown Fathers are planning an invasion of the neighbouring country of Khonti. As soon as Maxim and Guy return to Fatherland, they are captured and sent to war along with fellow prisoners, where Guy is killed in action. Funk, following Strider's orders, finds Maxim and takes him out of the war back to the capital. Fatherland is defeated, and the State prosecutor, who was an active supporter of the war, realizes that the Unknown Fathers will execute him for failure. He contacts Maxim and reveals the location of the Tower Control Center, urging him to use it for a coup d'√©tat. Maxim sneaks in, but instead of following the prosecutor's plan, he blasts the Center with explosives. As he exits the Center, he is confronted by angry Strider. He berates and beats Maxim and reveals himself as undercover spy from Earth. Maxim, a well- intentioned amateur, ruined the plan to save Fatherland and the rest of the planet that Strider has been preparing for decades. Strider tells Maxim to fly home to Earth. Maxim refuses and offers his help on one condition: another brainwashing center can never be built. After a fight and a heated argument, Strider reluctantly agrees. The final sequence shows rebels overthrowing the Unknown Fathers.

The production was filmed in Crimea, Ukraine, with photography lasting for 10 months (14 February ‚Äì 7 December 2007). The film had a total budget of about $36.6 million, including $10 million for the film's promotion and $1 million of state donations.  Reception  Dark Planet was met with mixed reviews. According to Russian review aggregator Kritikanstvo.ru, both parts hold an approximate approval rating around 6 of 10, based on 20 reviews. Many critics praised the film for being surprisingly faithful to the novel. Some praised the film's visual effects and action, while others criticized the work of the director and editor. A Mir Fantastiki review called the film a \\"chaotic mash of visual, dramatical and musical components, each of which separately has quite high quality\\". \\"As a result, the film is scattered throughout a sequence of \\"beautiful pictures\\" that do not shape an integrated view of the world\\", agrees Total DVD. Vasiliy Stepanov's acting as Maxim was met with criticism, but some of the supporting actors, such as Serebryakov and Garmash, were praised. The film was a relative commercial failure. Despite grossing around $30 million from two parts summarily and ranking among the top-grossing films of Russia's modern cinema, it didn't repay its budget of $36 mln. The movie was released for home video very shortly after it exited theatres. According to Bondarchuk, this helped the film to become profitable eventually. Boris Strugatsky, the only one of the book's co-authors who lived to see the film, said the film is a \\"directors' success\\", noting its faithfulness to the novel. He praised the work of Serebryakov (Strider), Bondarchuk (Prosecutor General) and Garmash (Zef), but expressed disappointment over the work of Kutsenko (Vepr'), Mikhalkova (Ordi Tader) and Merzlikin (Funk). He noted Stepanov as one of the biggest successes of the film, saying that \\"Maxim Kammerer is exactly as we imagined him\\".  Release  Due to the length of the story, the film was split in two parts: the first premiered on 18 December 2008 and the second on 23 April 2009. Bulldog Film Distribution released the film in February 2015, on 9 February as video on demand and on 16 February 2015 on DVD in the UK.

The Pasdeloup Orchestra (also referred to as Orchestre des Concerts Pasdeloup) is the oldest symphony orchestra in France.  History  Founded in 1861 by Jules Pasdeloup with the name Concerts Populaires, it is the oldest orchestra still in existence in Paris. Aimed at an audience hitherto absent from evening concerts, the orchestra presented cheap Sunday concerts in the vast rotonda of the Cirque d'hiver in Paris. The opening concert (27 October 1861), with an orchestra of 80 musicians, consisted of the following programme: * Overture to Oberon by Carl Maria von Weber * Beethoven‚Äôs Pastoral Symphony * Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto with Jean Alard * the Emperor's Hymn by Joseph Haydn.Cinquante Ans de Musique Fran√ßaise de 1874 √† 1925. Les √âditions Musicales de la Librairie de France, Paris, 1925. Rehearsals took place on Tuesday and Thursday at the Conservatoire and on Saturday at the Cirque d'hiver (musicians were paid 15 francs per concert with rehearsals). The first leader was Lancien, of the orchestra of the Paris Op√©ra. Early concerts included music by Berlioz and Wagner.Cinquante Ans de Musique Fran√ßaise de 1874 √† 1925. Les √âditions Musicales de la Librairie de France, Paris, 1925. The enterprise was a great success and the Concerts Populaires became a genuine institution, playing a lead role in forming a new audience through making known the Austro-German repertoire and also by influencing the creation of French symphonic works. Pasdeloup continued his activity until 1884 and tried in vain to restart in 1886 by mounting a festival devoted to C√©sar Franck (which was a success). The orchestra started up again in 1919, under the guidance of Serge Sandberg, with the title Orchestre Pasdeloup.

Since 1990, the orchestra has not had a permanent principal conductor and has been run by a committee; from 2000 this has been chaired by the violinist Marianne Rivi√®re. Patrice Fontanarosa is the current artistic advisor for the orchestra, while Jean-Christophe Keck oversees the direction of the Offenbach concerts.

It is considered the oldest of currently existing literary magazines in Slovenia. Although Sodobnost has traditionally been a magazine focused on cultural and literary issues, it nowadays covers a wide range of current affairs. It is part of the Eurozine editorial project. History and profile Sodobnost was established in 1933 by a group of left liberal intellectuals around Fran Albrecht, Josip Vidmar and Ferdo Kozak, who had left the national liberal magazine Ljubljanski zvon in disagreement with its appeasing policies towards the dictatorship of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and the centralist and non-democratic policies of the Yugoslav National Party. Its first two editors were the literary critic Josip Vidmar and author Ferdo Kozak. After 1935 the magazine became one of the strongest supporters of the creation of a Slovenian Popular Front, that is of a broad coalition of left wing groups that would fight against the threat of Fascism and for Slovenian autonomy within Yugoslavia. In a period when the Communist party was outlawed in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the magazine enabled many prominent Communists to publish articles under pseudonyms; among them were Edvard Kardelj, Boris Kidriƒç, and Ivo Brnƒçiƒç. In the artistic and literary sense, Sodobnost became the main platform for neo-realist and social realist authors, such as Pre≈æihov Voranc, Ciril Kosmaƒç, Mi≈°ko Kranjec, Ivan Potrƒç, Ludvik Mrzel and others. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 the magazine closed down. After World War II the magazine was re- established as Novi svet (\\"New World\\"), which changed its name to Na≈°a sodbonost (\\"Our Contemporary Time\\") in 1952, thus re-establishing the tradition with the interwar journal. Between 1946 and 1955, it mostly served as a means of cultural propaganda of the new Communist regime. During this time, it was edited by Boris Ziherl, the main cultural ideologist of the Communist Party of Slovenia. In 1955, Ziherl was replaced by a more pragmatic editorial board, and in 1963 it assumed its original name, Sodobnost. The following year, the literary historian and philosopher Du≈°an Pirjevec joined the editorial board, raising the overall intellectual level of the magazine. During this period, the contributors and editors of Sodobnost engaged in a long and sharp polemic with the alternative magazine Perspektive (edited by Taras Kermauner, Janko Kos, Dominik Smole and Dane Zajc), which assumed a more critical stand towards the Titoist regime. When the Perspektive were dissolved by the regime in 1964, the editors of Sodobnost published a solidarity note, and were replaced by the regime, as well. After a period of crisis in 1964-1965, the new editorial board (headed by the poet Ciril Zlobec) shifted the attitude of the magazine to moderate and pragmatic positions, which opened the magazine to all quality contributors who were not openly and militantly against the prevailing policies in Yugoslavia and Slovenia. Between the mid 1960s and early 1980s, Sodobnost enjoyed the status of the most prestigious magazine in Slovenia; after that, it went into a gradual but continuous decline. In the late 1990s, under the editor Evald Flisar it became more influential again.  Notable contributors  Many notable authors, critics and journalists have contributed to Sodobnost. Those include, besides the already mentioned, essayists Jo≈æe Javor≈°ek and Primo≈æ Kozak, historians Bogo Grafenauer and Igor Grdina, author and sociologist Igor ≈†kamperle, sociologist and politician Lev Kreft, poets Igo Gruden, Edvard Kocbek, Janez Menart, Miodrag Bulatoviƒá, Josip Osti, Iztok Osojnik and Niko Grafenauer, critic Bojan ≈†tih, writers Pre≈æihov Voranc, Igor Torkar, Lojze Kovaƒçiƒç, Du≈°an ≈†arotar and many others.

The park is near East Liverpool on the banks of Little Beaver Creek. Remnants of the historic Sandy and Beaver Canal can be found throughout the park. It is open for year-round recreation including, camping, boating, hunting, fishing and hiking. History The history of human habitation in the Beaver Creek area dates back to the Clovis culture, about 10,000 years ago. Archaeological digs nearby have uncovered arrowheads, pottery and knives that date back to these prehistoric Paleoindian people. The land in and around Beaver Creek State Park was inhabited by various Indian tribes. The last tribe to call the area home before being forced out by the encroachment of Anglo-American settlers in the Ohio Country were the Mingo and Wyandot Indians. A massacre of Mingo leader Logan's family nearby was the catalyst for Dunmore's War. The first permanent white settler in the area was John Quinn a trapper who moved into the Little Beaver Creek valley in 1790. He was soon followed by Anglo-American pioneers who cleared the forests and established frontier farms throughout eastern Ohio. The Sandy and Beaver Canal ran from the Ohio and Erie Canal at Bolivar, Ohio to the Ohio River at Glasgow, Pennsylvania. It had 90 locks, was chartered in 1828 and completed in 1848. However, the middle section of the canal had many problems from the beginning and fell into disrepair. The canal ceased to operate in 1852, when the Cold Run Reservoir Dam outside of Lisbon, Ohio broke, ruining a large portion of the canal. Remnants of the canal can be found at Beaver Creek State Park. John Hunt Morgan was a Confederate general and cavalry officer in the American Civil War. He is best known for Morgan's Raid in 1863, when he led 2,460 troops racing past Union lines into Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio in July 1863. This would be the farthest north any uniformed Confederate troops penetrated during the war. The raid ended when Morgan and his men were forced to surrender near what is now Beaver Creek State Park. Beaver Creek State Park was established in 1949 with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Attractions Gaston's Mill is a historic mill that was built in 1837 on Little Beaver Creek. It is now restored and is open to the public. The mill is in working condition with various displays of antique milling equipment located within the mill building. The mill works seasonally and grinds whole wheat flour, cornmeal and buckwheat flour. The historic recreation Pioneer Village features a log home, church, schoolhouse, general store and blacksmith shop, and is next to the mill. The village is open on weekends during the summer season. The Beaver Creek Wildlife Education Center features small live animals, natural history dioramas, displays of insects, arrowheads and nature photographs, and also houses a gift shop. The center's volunteers offer programs about nature and environmental conservation. Ecology Beaver Creek State Park is in the Appalachian Highlands region of Ohio. The hilly sandstone region is home to diverse plant and animal populations. The region contains nearly 70% of the woodlands in Ohio. At one time this same region was a barren wasteland that had been stripped of its old growth forests to provide fuel for the iron furnaces. The forests have since regrown with a diversity of hardwoods including hickory, oak, and maple. Little Beaver Creek is a state and national wild and scenic river. It flows through the park and creates a gorge in the soft sandstone hills of the park. The walls of the gorge are quite steep with high cliffs over the creek. Little Beaver Creek supports 63 species of fish, 49 mammal species, 140 types of birds and 46 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the rare and protected salamander known as the hellbender. A variety of animals are found in Beaver Creek State Park. These animals are protected from hunting in the park. They include most common Eastern Woodland creatures such as the white-tailed deer, skunks, wild turkeys, opossums, raccoons, eastern gray squirrels, great horned owls and numerous songbirds, reptiles and amphibians. Plant life at the park includes Dame's violet, goldenrod, spring beauties and asters. Recreation Beaver Creek State Park is open for year-round recreation. The park is bisected by Little Beaver Creek which is a cold water fishery. Common game fish include smallmouth and rock bass. Anglers and hunters are required to have a license issued by the state. The creek is open to canoes and rubber rafts. There are 16 miles of trails open to hiking in the park.

He is notable for being World War I's youngest recipient of Germany's highest decoration for military valor, the Pour le Merite.Franks et al 1993, p. 68. Early life and service Olivier Freiherr (Baron) von Beaulieu-Marconnay was born in Charlottenburg on 14 September 1898, the son of an aristocratic Prussian army captain. When World War I started in August 1914, he was a sixteen-year-old high school student. The following year, still 16, he volunteered as a cadet for service in his father's former regiment, the 4th Prussian Dragoons. He served with the Dragoons in Russia, and participated in fighting in the Rokitno Swamps in the summer of 1916. He was promoted to leutnant in July 1916, being awarded the Iron Cross First Class later in the year. Aerial Service He then transferred to the German air service in 1917 and by November had qualified as a pilot. On 1 December 1917 he was assigned to Jagdstaffel 18. He paid tribute to the 4th Prussian Dragoons by having a personal insignia painted on all his planes consisting of a numeral 4 merged with a capital letter D. His planes also featured a blue fuselage, yellow wheel covers, and nose painted yellow back to the cockpit. Beaulieu-Marconnay served with Jasta 18 without success until his transfer to Josef Veltjens' Jagdstaffel 15 on 20 March 1918. Jasta 15 had recently received the new Siemens-Schuckert D.III fighters, and were limited to defensive operations, as they had orders forbidding flights over enemy lines lest one of the new planes fall into Allied hands. However, on 28 May 1918, a formation of French Dorand AR.2s were reported over German held territory. The jasta scrambled to intercept and Beaulieu-Marconnay scored his first victory. The following month he scored regularly becoming an ace on 11 June and a week later had run his total to eight. A double victory on 9 August made him a double ace. He went on to score three more victories in August. Despite being only 19 years old, Beaulieu-Marconnay was then appointed to command Jagdstaffel 19 on 4 September. He would begin his tenure as commander by totalling ten victories in September, and four more in October. His 25th and last confirmed victory came on 10 October 1918. On October 18, in the confusion of a dogfight, Beaulieu-Marconnay was seriously wounded in the thigh, possibly as a result of 'friendly fire' from a fellow German pilot from Jagdstaffel 74. He managed to regain his home airfield and land safely, and was rushed to the hospital, bleeding freely and in very critical condition. The award of the Pour le Merite was reportedly rushed through as the Blue Max could not be awarded posthumously, and to procrastinate risked the young ace's death while he was honored with only the Iron Cross. Notice of the award was forwarded to the hospital on 26 October 1918. He was the youngest recipient of the 'Blue Max'. However, Olivier Freiherr von Beaulieu-Marconnay, who had lingered with his wound for ten days, died six hours before the news arrived, possibly as the result of a post-operative infection. He was buried in the famous Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin. Inline citations References * Franks, Norman; Bailey, Frank W.; Guest, Russell.

It includes various events and processes that led to the schism and also those events and processes that occurred as a result of the schism. Eastern and Western Christians had a history of differences and disagreements, some dating back to the period of Early Christianity. At the very root of what later became the Great Schism were several questions of pneumatology and ecclesiology. The most important theological difference occurred over various questions regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit, and the use of the filioque clause in the Nicene Creed. One of the main ecclesiological issues was the question of papal supremacy. Other points of difference were related to various liturgical, ritual, and disciplinary customs and practices. Some political and cultural processes also contributed to the breakout of the schism. Origins Eric Plumer writes \\"the divergence of the Eastern and Western churches, leading ultimately to the East-West Schism, was a process of many centuries, influenced by a host of political, cultural and theological factors. Similarly, Roger Haight asserts \\"the [East-West Schism] should not be understood to have occurred in the mutual excommunications [of 1054]\\" because those excommunications were \\"only one factor in a much longer and larger story involving cultural, political and theological factors.\\" Because so many factors contributed to the ever-widening separation between East and West, it is difficult to point to a specific date when it began or even identify a single primary cause of the schism. While most sources agree that the separation between East and West is clearly evident by the Photian schism in the 9th century, some point to tensions going back as far as the 4th century as the early signs of the separation between East and West.Rome and the Eastern Churches by Aidan Nichols pages 227-272 (chapter \\"The Photian Schism and the 'Filioque'\\") Publisher: Ignatius Press (February 1, 2010) Orthodox apologists point to incidents as early as the 2nd century as examples of claims by Rome to papal primacy and rejection by Eastern Churches. Some scholarsCleenewerck, Laurent His Broken Body: Understanding and Healing the Schism between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. Washington, DC: EUC Press (2008) pp. 145-155 have argued that sporadic schisms in the common unions took place under Pope Victor I (2nd century), Pope Stephen I (3rd century) and Pope Damasus I (4th and 5th century). Later on, disputes about theological and other questions led to schisms between the Churches in Rome and Constantinople from 482 to 519 and from 866 to 879. The idea that primacy in the Church was transferred along with the transfer of the imperial capital from Rome to Constantinople, was posited as early as the 6th century by John Philoponus and further advanced by Photios I of Constantinople in the 9th century. Constantinople, as the seat of the ruler of the empire and therefore of the world, was the highest among the patriarchates and, like the emperor, had the right to govern them.Milton V. Anastos, Aspects of the Mind of Byzantium (Political Theory, Theology, and Ecclesiastical Relations with the See of Rome), Ashgate Publications, Variorum Collected Studies Series, 2001. =Centers of Christianity= After the fall and destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, the early learning centers of the Church were Antioch and Alexandria. Founding of the Church of Alexandria had been assisted by Mark,John Binns, An Introduction to the Christian Orthodox Churches, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2002, p144 one of the Seventy Apostles. Antioch had attracted Peter and Paul and Barnabas, plus others of the apostles. Antioch was the base from which Paul made his missionary journeys.Acts 11:19-26, Acts 12:24-25, Acts 13:1-3, Acts 14:24-28, Acts 15:1-2, Acts 15:22-40, Acts 18:22-23, Acts 19:21-22, Gal 2:11-14 The Church of Antioch sent the apostles Peter and Paul to Rome to assist the fledgling church there in its growth. Antioch regarded Peter as its first bishop. Early development of the Eastern Church Saint Thomas went east and was said to be instrumental in establishing the Church in the Persian Empire and satellite kingdoms, although Saint Addai and Saint Mari, two of the Seventy Apostles were credited with most of the work of establishment in Persia. The Church of the East was as large as the Mediterranean Church for some centuries, especially in the 6th to 8th centuries with its movement into the Far East.John Binns, An Introduction to the Christian Orthodox Churches, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2002, esp pp 28-29 In the 4th century when the Roman emperors were trying to control the Church, theological questions were prevalent throughout the Roman Empire.John Binns, An Introduction to the Christian Orthodox Churches, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2002, pp 162-164 The influence of Greek speculative thought on Christian thinking led to divergent and conflicting opinions.John Binns, An Introduction to the Christian Orthodox Churches, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2002, p68 Christ's commandment to love others as He loved seemed to have been lost in the intellectual abstractions of the time. Theology was used as a weapon against opponent bishops, since being branded a heretic was the only sure way for a bishop to be removed by other bishops. Over the course of history, tensions have arisen when church leaders have been perceived to have overstepped their bounds. Rise of Rome The first institution to fail in the early Christian Empire was politics. In the 5th century, western imperial power fell prior to the invasion of the Barbarian kings. However, the increase in power of the pope resulted in the retread of previous politicians, which in effect blurred the fine line between secular and ecclesiastical power. Up until the ecumenical councils, Rome was regarded as an important centre of Christianity, especially since it was the capital of the Roman Empire. The eastern and southern Mediterranean bishops generally recognized a persuasive leadership and authority of the bishop of Rome, but the Mediterranean Church did not regard the bishop of Rome as any sort of infallible source, nor did they acknowledge any juridical authority of Rome. The church at Rome claimed a special authority over the other churches because of its connection with the apostles Peter and Paul. In the first three centuries, Rome gained increasing recognition as one of the centers of Christianity. However, the extant documents of that era yield no clear-cut claims to, or recognition, of papal primacy. Historian Will Durant writes that, after Jerusalem, the church of Rome naturally became the primary church, the capital of Christianity.Durant, Will. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972 Rome had an early and significant Christian population. It was closely identified with the Apostle Paul, who preached and was martyred there, and the Apostle Peter, who was a martyr there as well. The Eastern Orthodox liturgy calls Peter and Paul \\"the wisest Apostles and their princes\\" and \\"the radiant ornaments of Rome\\".Menaion, 29 June Peter is seen as founder of the Church in Rome,The Illuminator, The Newspaper of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Pittsburgh, Oct.-Dec. 2004, p.7 and the bishops of Rome as his successors.\\"Linus was bishop of Rome after the holy apostle Peter\\"Pope Benedict XVI is \\"the 265th successor of the St Peter\\" Order of Saint Andrew the Apostle, 2007 Annual Report to His All Holiness Bartholomew While the Eastern cities of Alexandria and Antioch produced theological works, the bishops of Rome focused on what Romans admittedly did best: administration. Father Thomas Hopko, a leading Orthodox theologian, writes: \\"The church of Rome held a special place of honor among the earliest Christian churches. It was first among the communities that recognized each other as catholic churches holding the orthodox faith concerning God's Gospel in Jesus. According to St Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch who died a martyr's death in Rome around the year 110, 'the church which presides in the territories of the Romans' was 'a church worthy of God, worthy of honor, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy of sanctification, and presiding in love, maintaining the law of Christ, bearer of the Father's name.' The Roman church held this place of honor and exercised a 'presidency in love' among the first Christian churches for two reasons. It was founded on the teaching and blood of the foremost Christian apostles Peter and Paul. And it was the church of the capital city of the Roman empire that then constituted the 'civilized world (oikoumene)'.\\"Roman Presidency and Christian Unity in our Time Quartodeciman controversy and beyond Towards the end of the 2nd century, Victor, the Bishop of Rome, attempted to resolve the Quartodeciman controversy by excommunicating churches in the Roman province of Asia. This incident is cited by some Orthodox Christians as the first example of overreaching by the Bishop of Rome and resistance of such by Eastern churches. Laurent Cleenewerck suggests that this could be argued to be the first fissure between the Eastern and Western churches. The Quartodeciman controversy arose because Christians in the Roman province of Asia (Western Anatolia) celebrated Easter at the spring full moon, like the Jewish Passover, while the churches in the rest of the world observed the practice of celebrating it on the following Sunday (\\"the day of the resurrection of our Saviour\\")Eusebius, Church History, chapter 23In 155, Anicetus, Bishop of Rome, presided over a church council at Rome that was attended by a number of bishops including Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna. Although the council failed to reach agreement on the issue, ecclesiastical communion was preserved.Orthodox Answers: An Orthodox Christian Historical Timeline A generation later, synods of bishops in Palestine, Pontus (Northern Anatolia) and Osrhoene in the east, and in Rome and Gaul in the west, unanimously declared that the celebration should be exclusively on Sunday. In 193, Pope Victor I presided over a council in Rome and subsequently sent a letter about the matter to Polycrates of Ephesus and the churches of the Roman province of Asia. In the same year, Polycrates presided over a council at Ephesus attended by several bishops throughout that province, which rejected Victor's authority and kept the province's paschal tradition. Thereupon, Victor attempted to cut off Polycrates and the others who took this stance from the common unity but later reversed his decision after bishops that included Saint Irenaeus, Bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, interceded, recommending that Victor adopt the more tolerant stance of his predecessor, Anicetus.Eusebius, Church History, chapter 24 Despite Victor's failure to carry out his intent to excommunicate the Asian churches, many Catholic apologists point to this episode as evidence of papal primacy and authority in the early Church, citing the fact that none of the bishops challenged his right to excommunicate but rather questioned the wisdom and charity of doing so. Orthodox apologists argue that Victor had to relent in the end and note that the Eastern Churches never granted Victor presidency over anything other than the Church of Rome. The rejection of Bishop Anicetus' position on the Quartodeciman by Polycarp and later Polycrates' letter to Pope Victor I has been used by Orthodox theologians as proof against the argument that the Churches in Asia Minor accepted the Primacy of the Bishop of Rome or papal supremacy. The opinion of the Bishop of Rome was often sought, especially when the patriarchs of the Eastern Mediterranean were locked in fractious dispute. The bishops of Rome never obviously belonged to either the Antiochian or the Alexandrian schools of theology and usually managed to steer a middle course between whatever extremes were being propounded by theologians of either school. Because Rome was remote from the centres of Christianity in the eastern Mediterranean, it was frequently hoped its bishop would be more impartial. For instance, in 431, Cyril, the patriarch of Alexandria, appealed to Pope Celestine I, as well as the other patriarchs, charging Nestorius with heresy, which was dealt with at the Council of Ephesus. Following the sack of Rome by invading European Goths, Rome slid into the Dark Ages which afflicted most parts of Western Europe, and became increasingly isolated and irrelevant to the wider Mediterranean Church. This was a situation which suited and pleased a lot of the Eastern Mediterranean patriarchs and bishops.Aristeides Papadakis The Christian East and the Rise of the Papacy, SVS Press, NY, 1994 esp p14 It was not until the rise of Charlemagne and his successors that the Church of Rome arose out of obscurity on the back of the military successes of the western Mediterranean adventurers. =Council of Nicaea (325)= Hagia Sophia, cathedral of Constantinople at the time of the schism the Emperor Constantine (centre) and the bishops of the First Council of Nicaea (325) holding the Niceno‚ÄìConstantinopolitan Creed of 381. The Second Ecumenical Council whose additions to the original Nicene Creed lay at the heart of one of the theological disputes associated with the East‚ÄìWest Schism. (Illustration, 879‚Äì882 AD, from manuscript, Homilies of Gregory of Nazianzus, Biblioth√®que nationale de France) When Roman Emperor Constantine the Great embraced Christianity, he summoned the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea in 325 to resolve a number of issues which troubled the Church. The bishops at the council confirmed the position of the metropolitan sees of Rome and Alexandria as having authority outside their own province, and also the existing privileges of the churches in Antioch and the other provinces.\\"Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that the Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all these, since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also. Likewise in Antioch and the other provinces, let the Churches retain their privileges\\" (First Ecumenical Council, Canon VI). These sees were later called Patriarchates and were given an order of precedence: Rome, as capital of the empire was naturally given first place, then came Alexandria and Antioch. In a separate canon the Council also approved the special honor given to Jerusalem over other sees subject to the same metropolitan.\\"Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed that the Bishop of √Ülia [i.e., Jerusalem] should be honoured, let him, saving its due dignity to the Metropolis, have the next place of honour\\" (First Ecumenical Council, Canon VII The centre of politics in the empire shifted to the eastern Mediterranean. Rome lost the Senate to Constantinople and lost its status and gravitas as imperial capital. Soon the local bishop was elevated to patriarch under Constantine, as Metrophanes of ByzantiumSt Metrophanes the first Patriarch of Constantinople. Saint Metrophanes, Patriarch of Constantinople, was a contemporary of St Constantine the Great (306‚Äì337). His father, Dometius, was a brother of the Roman emperor Probus (276‚Äì282). Seeing the falseness of the pagan religion, Dometius came to believe in Christ. During a time of terrible persecution of Christians at Rome, St Dometius set off to Byzantium with two of his sons, Probus and Metrophanes. They were instructed in the law of the Lord by Bishop Titus, a man of holy life. Seeing the ardent desire of Dometius to labor for the Lord, St Titus ordained him presbyter. After the death of Titus first Dometius (272‚Äì303) was elevated to the bishop's throne, and thereafter his sons, Probus (303‚Äì315) and in 316 St Metrophanes. The emperor Constantine once came to Byzantium, and was delighted by the beauty and comfortable setting of the city. And having seen the holiness of life and sagacity of St Metrophanes, the emperor took him back to Rome. Soon Constantine the Great transferred the capital from Rome to Byzantium and he brought St Metrophanes there. The First Ecumenical Council was convened in 325 to resolve the Arian heresy. Constantine the Great had the holy Fathers of the Council bestow upon St Metrophanes the title of Patriarch. Thus, the saint became the first Patriarch of Constantinople. Thereafter, the bishop's connection with the imperial court meant that he was able to free himself from ecclesiastical dependency on Heraclea and in little more than half a century to obtain recognition of next-after-Rome ranking from the first Council held within the walls of the new capital.Following the establishment of Constantinople (the ancient city of Byzantium) as the state capital of the Roman Empire in the early part of the fourth century, a series of significant ecclesiastical events saw the status of the Bishop of New Rome (as Constantinople was then called) elevated to its current position and privilege. The Western bishops took no part, and the Latin Church recognized the see as ecumenical only in the mid-6th century: \\"The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honour after the Bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome\\",Canon 3 thus raising it above the sees of Alexandria and Antioch. This has been described as sowing the seed for the ecclesiastical rivalry between Constantinople and Rome that was a factor leading to the schism between East and West. Alexandria's objections to Constantinople's promotion, which led to a constant struggle between the two sees in the first half of the 5th century,Klaus Schatz: Primat und Reichskirchliche Strukturen im 5. ‚Äì 9. Jahrhundert were supported by Rome, which proposed the theory that the most important sees were the three Petrine ones, with Rome in first place. However, after the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the position of the Patriarchate of Alexandria was weakened by a division in which the great majority of its Christian population followed the form of Christianity that its opponents called monophysitism. =Five patriarchs= Emperor Theodosius I called the Second Ecumenical Council, held at the new capital in 381. The council elevated the see of Constantinople to a position ahead of the other chief metropolitan sees, except that of Rome.\\"The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honor after the Bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome.\\" (Second Ecumenical Council, ) It divided the eastern Roman Empire into five dioceses: Egypt (under Alexandria), the East (under Antioch), Asia (under Ephesus), Pontus (under Caesarea Cappadociae), and Thrace (originally under Heraclea, later under Constantinople).L'idea di pentarchia nella cristianit√† The council decreed that the synod of each province should manage the ecclesiastical affairs of that province alone, except for the privileges already recognized for Alexandria and Antioch.\\"Let the Bishop of Alexandria, according to the canons, alone administer the affairs of Egypt; and let the bishops of the East manage the East alone, the privileges of the Church in Antioch, which are mentioned in the canons of Nice, being preserved; and let the bishops of the Asian Diocese administer the Asian affairs only; and the Pontic bishops only Pontic matters; and the Thracian bishops only Thracian affairs\\" (Second Ecumenical Council, Canon II) In 382, a synod in Rome under Pope Damasus I protested against the raising of Constantinople to a position above Alexandria and spoke of Rome as \\"the apostolic see\\".Nichols (2010), p. 202 Pope Siricius (384-399) claimed for papal decretals the same binding force as decisions of synods, Pope Innocent I (401-417) said that all major judicial cases should be reserved for the see of Rome, and Pope Boniface I (418-422) declared that the church of Rome stands to \\"the churches throughout the world as the head to its members\\" and that bishops everywhere, while holding the one same episcopal office, must \\"recognise those to whom, for the sake of ecclesiastical discipline, they should be subject\\".Nichols (2010), p. 203 Pope Celestine I (422-432) considered that the condemnation of Nestorius by his own Roman synod in 430 was sufficient, but consented to the general council as \\"of benefit in manifesting the faith\\"Nichols (2010), p. 203\\\\. The First Council of Ephesus in 431 stated that it condemned Nestorius \\"compelled thereto by the canons and by the letter of our most holy father and fellow-servant Coelestine, the Roman bishop\\" (Decree of the Council against Nestorius). Pope Leo I and his successors rejected canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon, as a result of which it was not officially recorded even in the East until the 6th century.[http://www.aoiusa.org/canon-28-and-eastern-papalism-cause-or-effect/ George C.

The pope was considered the first among equals.Faith and Order: The Reconciliation of Law and Religion By Harold Joseph Berman pg 41 Although Pope Leo I's delegates were absent when this resolution was passed, he recognized the council as ecumenical and confirmed its doctrinal decrees. He rejected its Canon 28 on the grounds that it contravened the sixth canon of Nicaea and infringed the rights of Alexandria and Antioch. However, by that time Constantinople, the permanent residence of the emperor, had in reality enormous influence, and had it not been for the opposition of Rome, its bishop could easily have been given first place among all the bishops. Eastern Orthodox churches state that the 28th Canon explicitly proclaimed the equality of the bishops of Rome and Constantinople,There are no primacies nor primates according to Roman Orthodox Canon Law, but only bishops with \\"Seniority of Honor\\" since all bishops are doctrinally equal.

In its disputed 28th Canon, the council also recognized an authority of Constantinople over bishops of dioceses \\"among the barbarians\\", which has been variously interpreted as referring either to all areas outside the Byzantine Empire or only to those in the vicinity of Pontus, Asia and Thrace or to non-Greeks within the empire. This canon was a source of friction between East and West until the mutual excommunications of 1054 made it irrelevant in that regard; but controversy about its applicability to the authority of the patriarchate of Constantinople still continues.McGuckin (2010), p. 137 Canon 9 of the Council also declared: \\"If a bishop or clergyman should have a difference with the metropolitan of the province, let him have recourse to the Exarch of the Diocese, or to the throne of the Imperial City of Constantinople, and there let it be tried.\\" This has been interpreted as conferring on the see of Constantinople a greater privilege than what any council ever gave Rome.Johnson, quoted by SchaffHefele, quoted by SchaffCanon 9 and Notes =Empires East and West= Disunion in the Roman Empire further contributed to disunion in the Church. The Emperor Diocletian famously divided the administration of the eastern and western portions of the empire in the early 4th century, though subsequent leaders (including Constantine) aspired to and sometimes gained control of both regions. Theodosius the Great, who established Nicene Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire (see Edict of Thessalonica), was the last emperor to rule over a united Roman Empire. Following his death in 395, the division into western and eastern halves, each for a few decades still under its own Emperor, was never reunited. Following the sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths, Rome became increasingly isolated from the churches in the eastern and southern Mediterranean. This was a situation which suited and pleased many of the patriarchs and bishops of those churches. The Western Roman Empire soon ceased to exist. In the early fifth century, its whole territory was overrun by Germanic tribes, and in 476, the Western Roman Empire in Italy was declared defunct, when the Scirian Odoacer deposed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and declared himself rex Italiae (\\"King of Italy\\").The Eastern Roman Empire (known also as the Byzantine Empire) continued to thrive. Thus, the political unity of the Roman Empire was the first to fall. When royal and imperial rule re-established itself, it had to contend with power wielded independently by the Church. In the East, however, imperial and later Islamic rule dominated the Eastern bishops of Byzantium. The Orthodox regions that were predominantly Slavic experienced period foreign dominance as well as period without infrastructure. The Eastern Roman Empire (known also as the Byzantine Empire) continued to thrive and in the 6th century recovered Italy and other sections of the western Mediterranean shore. It soon lost most of that territory. It continued to hold Rome, as part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, until 751. In the West, the collapse of civil government left the Church practically in charge in many areas, and bishops took to administering secular cities and domains. In other areas, Christianity became mostly subject to the laws and customs of nations that owed no allegiance to the emperor. These Germanic peoples, particularly the Franks, influenced and changed the Latin Church.Roman Revolutions and the Rise of Frankish Feudalism and Doctrine.Many other factors caused the East and West to drift further apart. The dominant language of the West was Latin, whilst that of the East was Greek. Soon after the fall of the Western Empire, the number of individuals who spoke both Latin and Greek began to dwindle, and communication between East and West grew much more difficult. When the Latins showed up at councils in the East, they spoke in Latin which was not understood by the other delegates, who continued to speak Greek, which, in turn, was not understood by the Latins. Both sides became suspicious of the other.Catholic Encyclopedia With linguistic unity gone, cultural unity began to crumble as well. The two halves of the Church were naturally divided along similar lines; they developed different rites and had different approaches to religious doctrines. Although the Great Schism was still centuries away, its outlines were already perceptible. =Decline of three patriarchies= By 661, Muslim Arabs had conquered the territories assigned to the patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, which thereafter were never more than partially and temporarily recovered. In 732, Leo III the Isaurian, in revenge for the opposition of Pope Gregory III to the emperor's iconoclast policies, transferred Sicily, Calabria and Illyria from the patriarchate of Rome (whose jurisdiction until then extended as far east as Thessalonica) to that of Constantinople.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Leo III The Constantinople patriarchate, after expanding eastward at the time of the Council of Chalcedon to take in Pontus and the Roman province of Asia, which at that time were still under the emperor's control, thus expanded equally to the west, and was practically coextensive with the Byzantine Empire. =Quinisext Council (692)= The West's rejection of the Quinisext Council of 692 led to pressure from the Eastern Empire on the West to reject many Latin customs as non-Orthodox. The Latin practices that had gotten the attention of the other Patriarchates and that had been condemned by this Council included the practice of celebrating Mass on weekdays in Lent (rather than having Pre-Sanctified Liturgies);Canon LII fasting on Saturdays throughout the year;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xiv.iii.lvi.html Canon LV omitting the \\"Alleluia\\" in Lent; depicting Christ as a lamb;Canon LXXXII using unleavened bread.Canon XI Larger disputes were revealed regarding Eastern and Western attitudes toward celibacy for priests and deacons, with the Council affirming the right of married men to become priests (though forbidding priests to marry and forbidding bishops to live with their wives)Canon VI and Schaff, \\"Excursus on the Marriage of the Clergy\\"Canon XII and prescribing deposition for anyone who attempted to separate a clergyman other than a bishop from his wife, or for any cleric other than a bishop who dismissed his wife.Canon XIII and Canon XLVIII Pope Sergius I, who was of Syrian origin, rejected the council, preferring, he said, \\"to die rather than consent to erroneous novelties\\". Though a loyal subject of the empire, he would not be \\"its captive in matters of religion\\" and refused to sign the canons. Emperor Justinian II ordered his arrest and abduction to Constantinople by the notoriously violent protospatharios Zacharias.Ekonomou (2007), p. 223 However, the militia of the exarchate of Ravenna frustrated the attempt.Ekonomou (2007), p. 224 Zacharias nearly lost his life in his attempt to arrest Sergius I.Ekonomou (2007), p. 44 Meanwhile, in Visigothic Hispania, the council was ratified by the Eighteenth Council of Toledo at the urging of King Wittiza, who was vilified by later chroniclers for his decision.Collins, 19.

The primary causes of the schism were disputes over conflicting claims of jurisdiction, in particular over papal authorityPope Leo IX claimed he held authority over the four Eastern patriarchs - and over the insertion of the Filioque clause into the Nicene Creed by the Western patriarch in 1014.Aristeides Papadakis The Christian East and the Rise of the Papacy, SVS Press, NY, 1994 p14) The seventh canon of the Council of Ephesus declared: :It is unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different (·ºëœÑŒ≠œÅŒ±ŒΩ) Faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nic√¶a. But those who shall dare to compose a different faith, or to introduce or offer it to persons desiring to turn to the acknowledgment of the truth, whether from Heathenism or from Judaism, or from any heresy whatsoever, shall be deposed, if they be bishops or clergymen; bishops from the episcopate and clergymen from the clergy; and if they be laymen, they shall be anathematized(Extracts from the Acts of the Council of Ephesus). The creed quoted in the Acts of the Council of Ephesus (the Third Ecumenical Council) is that of the first Ecumenical Council, not the creed as modified by the second Ecumenical Council, and so does not have additions such as \\"who proceeds from the Father\\" (ibidem). Eastern Orthodox today state that this Canon of the Council of Ephesus explicitly prohibited modification of the Nicene Creed drawn up by the first Ecumenical Council in 325, the wording of which but, it is claimed, not the substance, had been modified by the second Ecumenical Council, making additions such as \\"who proceeds from the Father\\". In the Orthodox view, the Bishop of Rome (i.e. the Pope) would have universal primacy in a reunited Christendom, as primus inter pares without power of jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodox argue that the seventh canon of the Council of Ephesus explicitly prohibited modification of the Nicene Creed by any man (not by Ecumenical church council) drawn up by the first Ecumenical Council in 325.NPNF2-14.

This was not a change of the orthodoxy of the churches' original creed.\\"However, the chief of the heretics who distorted the apostolic teaching concerning the Holy Spirit was Macedonius, who occupied the cathedra of Constantinople as archbishop in the 4th century and found followers for himself among former Arians and Semi-Arians. He called the Holy Spirit a creation of the Son, and a servant of the Father and the Son. Accusers of his heresy were Fathers of the Church like Sts. Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian, Athanasius the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, Amphilocius, Diodores of Tarsus, and others, who wrote works against the heretics. The false teaching of Macedonius was refuted first in a series of local councils and finally at the Second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381. In preserving Orthodoxy, the Second Ecumenical Council completed the Nicaean Symbol of Faith with these words: \\"And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is equally worshiped and glorified, Who spake by the Prophets,\\" as well as those articles of the Creed which follow this in the Nicaean-Constantinopolitan Symbol of Faith.\\" Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky St Herman of Alaska Brotherhood press 1994 () Thus the word ·ºëœÑŒ≠œÅŒ±ŒΩ in the seventh canon of the later Council of Ephesus is understood as meaning \\"different\\", \\"contradictory\\", and not \\"another\\" in the sense of mere explanatory additions to the already existing creed. Some scholars hold that the additions attributed to the First Council of Constantinople were adopted only with the 451 Council of Chalcedon, 20 years after that of Ephesus, and even that the Council of Ephesus, in which Alexandrian influence was dominant, was by this canon excluding the Constantinopolitan Creed, which eventually annexed the name and fame of the creed adopted at Nicaea.Joan Mervyn Hussey, The Cambridge Medieval History (CUP Archive), vol. 8, p. 177 There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over liturgical practices. =Schism of 863= A major break between the Churches of Rome and Constantinople occurred in 863 and lasted for several years. In 858, Byzantine Emperor Michael III enforced the deposition of Patriarch Ignatios of Constantinople, replacing him with new Patriarch Photios. At least five councils (859, 861, 867, 869-870, 879-880) as a result. Appealed by the supporters of Ignatios, Pope Nicholas I also held a synod at the Lateran in 863, reverting the decisions of 858, confirming Ignatios as patriarch, and anathematizing Photios. This was seen by the East as an unacceptable intervention, since Nicholas was intervening in the process of election and confirmation of patriarchs in ecclesial jurisdictions other than his own. By attempting to remove Photius and reappoint Ignatius on his own authority and decree, the Nicolas was also intervening in the matters of imperial authority as well as the other churches of the East and their own internal councils and authorities, which they understood to be outside the pope's own jurisdiction of Rome. In response to that, Photius covened a council in 867 to address the question of Papal supremacy and also the use of Filioque clause in the Creed.A. Fortescue, The Orthodox Eastern Church, pages 147‚Äì148;Andrew Louth, Greek East and Latin West, pg171S.

The relations between the papacy and the Byzantine court were good in the years leading up to 1054. Emperor Constantine IX and Pope Leo IX were allied through the mediation of the Lombard catepan of Italy, Argyrus, who had spent years in Constantinople, originally as a political prisoner. Leo and Argyrus led armies against the ravaging Normans, but the papal forces were defeated at the Battle of Civitate in 1053, which resulted in the pope being imprisoned at Benevento, where he took it upon himself to learn Greek. Argyrus had not arrived at Civitate, and his absence caused a rift in papal-imperial relations. Meanwhile, the Normans were busy imposing Latin customs, including the unleavened breadwith papal approval. Michael I, Patriarch of Constantinople, then ordered Leo, Archbishop of Ochrid, to write a letter to the bishop of Trani, John, an Easterner, in which he attacked the \\"Judaistic\\" practices of the West, namely the use of unleavened bread. The letter was sent by John to all the bishops of the West, including the pope, and the letter was passed to Humbert of Mourmoutiers, the cardinal-bishop of Silva Candida, who translated the letter into Latin and brought it to the pope, who ordered a reply to be made to each charge and a defense of papal supremacy to be laid out in a response. In 1054, Pope Leo IX sent a letter to Michael Cerularius that cited a large portion of the forgery called the Donation of Constantine, believing it genuine.Migne's Patrologia Latina, Vol. 143 (cxliii), Col. 744‚Äì769. Also Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova Amplissima Collectio, Vol. 19 (xix) Col. 635‚Äì656. The official status of this letter is acknowledged in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume 5, entry on Donation of Constantine. Leo IX assured the Patriarch that the donation was genuine, so only the apostolic successor to Peter possessed that primacy and was the rightful head of all the Church. The Patriarch rejected the claims of papal primacy. Michael became convinced to avoid debate and prevent the impending breach. However, Humbert and the pope made no concessions, and Humbert was sent with legatine powers to the imperial capital to solve the questions raised once and for all. Humbert, Frederick of Lorraine, and Peter, Archbishop of Amalfi, set out in early spring and arrived in April 1054. They were met with a hostile reception. They stormed out of the palace, leaving the papal response with Michael, whose anger matched their own. The seals on the letter had been tampered with and the legates had published, in Greek, an earlier, far less civil, draft of the letter for the entire populace to read. The patriarch refused to recognize their authority. When Pope Leo died on 19 April 1054, the legates' authority legally ceased, but they ignored this technicality. In response to the patriarch's refusal to address the issues at hand, the legatine mission took an extreme measure. On 16 July 1054, the three legates produced a Charter of Excommunication (lat. charta excommunicationis), directed against Patriarch Michael of Constantinople, Archbishop Leo of Ohrid, and their followers. On the same day, legates entered the church of the Hagia Sophia during the divine liturgy and placed the charter on the altar. In the charter, papal legates made 11 accusations against Michael and \\"the backers of his foolishness\\", beginning with that of promoting to the episcopacy men who have been castrated and of rebaptizing those already baptized in the name of the Trinity, and ending with the accusation of refusing communion and baptism to menstruating women and of refusing to be in communion with those who tonsure their heads and shave their beards. Denial of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son is given seventh place in the list of Greek errors, and a reference was made regarding the alleged Greek exclusion of that doctrine from the Creed.Text of the bull of excommunication. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-06-02. The legates left Constantinople two days later, after an audience with the emperor. By the time of their departure, the city was near riot. The patriarch had the support of the people against the emperor, who had supported the legates to his own detriment. To assuage popular anger, Argyrus' family in Constantinople was arrested. An imperial envoy, sent to invite legates to come back for further discuusions, reached them at Selymbria. They attempted to return but failed and departed for Rome. At that point, Cerularius decided to strike back. A synod of 21 metropolitans and bishops, held on 20 July 1054 in Constantinople and presided by Cerularius, in turn excommunicated the legates. On 24 July, the anathema was officially proclaimed in the Hagia Sophia Church, and copies of the legatine charter were set to be burnt, while the original was placed in the patriarchal archive. Only the legates were anathematized, and a general reference was made to all who support them, but there was no explicit excommunication of the entire Western Christianity or the Church of Rome. Eastern Orthodox Bishop Kallistos (formerly Timothy Ware) writes that the choice of Cardinal Humbert was unfortunate, for both he and Patriarch Michael I were men of stiff and intransigent temper... . After [an initial, unfriendly encounter] the patriarch refused to have further dealings with the legates. Eventually Humbert lost patience, and laid a Charter of Excommunication against Patriarch Michael I on the altar of the Church of the Holy Wisdom... . Michael and his synod retaliated by anathematizing Humbert. The consummation of the schism is generally dated from 1054, when this sequence of events took place. However, these events only triggered the beginning of the schism. The schism was not actually consummated by the seemingly mutual excommunications. The New Catholic Encyclopedia reports that the legates had been careful not to intimate that the Charter of Excommunication implied a general excommunication of the Byzantine Church. The charter excommunicated only Patriarch Micheal Cerularius, Archbishop Leo of Ochrid, and their adherents. Thus, the New Catholic Encyclopedia argues that the dispute need not have produced a permanent schism any more than excommunication of any \\"contumacious bishop\\". The schism began to develop when all the other Eastern patriarchs supported Cerularius. According to the New Catholic Encyclopedia, it was the support of Emperor Michael VI Stratiotikos that impelled them to support Cerularius. Some have questioned the validity of the charter on the grounds that Pope Leo IX had died at that time and so the authority of the legates to issue such a document is unclear. =Aftermath= At the time of the excommunications, many contemporary historians, including Byzantine chroniclers, did not consider the event significant.John Binns, An Introduction to the Christian Orthodox Churches (Cambridge University Press 2002 ), p. 203 Francis Dvornik states: \\"In spite of what happened in 1054, the faithful of both church remained long unaware of any change in their relations and acts of intercommunion were so numerous that 1054 as the date of the schism becomes inadmissible.\\"Eastern Churches Quarterly. Church History and Christian Reunion, January‚ÄìMarch 1945, pp. 29‚Äì30, quoted in Archdale King, The Rites of Eastern Christendom (Gorgias Press 2007 ), vol. 1, p. 6 Kallistos Ware agrees: \\"Even after 1054 friendly relations between East and West continued. The two parts of Christendom were not yet conscious of a great gulf of separation between them. ... The dispute remained something of which ordinary Christians in the East and West were largely unaware.\\"Bishop Kallistos (Ware), p. 67 In 1089, the Russian Church felt so little separated from the Western that it instituted a liturgical feast to commemorate the formerly disputed translation of about half of the relics of Saint Nicholas of Myra from Asia to Bari in Italy just two years earlier.Dimiti Obolensky, Byzantium and the Slavs (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 1994 ), pp. 94‚Äì95 This fluidity explains in part the different interpretations of the geographical line of division in the two maps given here, one drawn up in the West, the other in a country where Eastern Orthodoxy predominates. Areas such as the extreme south of Italy are interpreted variously as adhering to either East or West. And even in areas whose rulers took one position, there were some who gave their allegiance to the other side. An example is Kingdom of Hungary, where the Roman Catholic Church was upheld by the crown from the time of Stephen I, but \\"monasteries and convents belonging to the Byzantine Church were founded sporadically in the eleventh century.L√∂vei Efforts were made in subsequent centuries by popes and patriarchs to heal the rift between the churches. However, a number of factors and historical events worked to widen the separation over time. East and West since 1054 The events of July 1054 had various religious and political consequences, both in East and West. Upon their return to Rome in the late summer of 1054, Cardinal Humbert and his colleagues found the Roman see still in the state of vacancy. Since there was no pope, all discussions and decisions regarding the Constantinopolitan events of July 1054 had to be postponed, until the next papal conclave. At that time, political situation in Italy was complex, which prolonged the vacancy until April 1055, when new Pope Victor II was elected. Victor II was preoccupied with the affairs of the Holy Roman Empire, but after his death in summer of 1057, the papacy was given to Cardinal Frederick of Lorraine, one of three envoys of 1054, who was elected pope as Stephen IX. Faced with the Norman menace in southern Italy, Stephen IX decided to send a delegation to Byzantine Emperor Isaac I Komnenos. Papal legates departed from Rome at the beginning of 1058, but when they reached the Byzantine-held Bari, news came that Stephen IX had died, and mission was abandoned. It remained unknown whether the failed mission of 1058 had both political and religious aspects, as was the case with the earlier mission of 1054 and also with several later missions. In 1073, contacts between Constantinople and Rome were initiated by Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas, who sent envoys to Pope Gregory VII, and on that occasion some discussions were held regarding both political and religious issues, but no agreement was reached. In 1089, Pope Urban II held the Council of Melfi, reopening the discussion between West and East. In September 1089, a local council was held in Constantinople, reexamining relations between the East and West. Similar discussions between Latins and Greeks were also held in 1098 at the Council of Bari. By the end of the 11th century, the two churches had drifted further apart and continued to diverge over a period of several centuries, with occasional periods of improved relations, marked by several failed attempts of reconciliation. Bishop Kallistos (Ware) writes: \\"Even after 1054 friendly relations between East and West continued. The two parts of Christendom were not yet conscious of a great gulf of separation between them. ... The dispute remained something of which ordinary Christians in East and West were largely unaware\\".Bishop Kallistos (Ware), op. cit., p. 67 Starting from the late 11th century, dependency of Byzantine Empire on the naval forces of Republic of Venice and, to a lesser extent, Republic of Genoa and Republic of Pisa, led to predominance of Roman Catholic merchants in Byzantium (they were getting major trading concessions starting from the 1080s), subsequently causing economic and social upheaval. Together with the perceived arrogance of the Italians, it fueled popular resentment amongst the middle and lower classes both in the countryside and in the cities. By the second half of the 12th century practically uncontrollable rivalry between competitors from different city states made it to Italians raiding quarters of other Italians in the capital, and retaliatory draconian measures by the Byzantine authorities led to subsequent deterioration of inter-religious relations in the city. When in 1182 regency of empress mother Maria of Antioch, an ethnical French notorious for the favoritism shown to Latin merchants and the big aristocratic land-owners, was deposed by Andronikos I Komnenos on the wake of popular support, the new emperor allowed mobs to massacre hated foreigners. Henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti-Latin in the West.J. Harris, Byzantium and the Crusades, 112 =Fourth Crusade and other military conflicts= During the Fourth Crusade, Latin crusaders and Venetian merchants sacked Constantinople, looting The Church of Holy Wisdom and various other Orthodox Holy sitesDuring the Crusades the schism was deepened by the brutal atrocities of the French and Venetian soldiers in the pillage of Constantinople (1204), the establishment of a Latin empire, and the appointment by the pope of Latin bishops in Greek sees.318 Although this artificial empire lasted only half a century (1204‚Äì1261), it left a legacy of burning hatred in the memories of horrible desecrations and innumerable insults and outrages, which the East had to endure from the Western barbarians. Churches and monasteries were robbed and desecrated, the Greek service mocked, the clergy persecuted, and every law of decency set at defiance. In Constantinople \\"a prostitute was seated on the throne of the patriarch; and that daughter of Belial, as she is styled, sung and danced in the church to ridicule the hymns and processions of the Orientals.\\" Even Pope Innocent III. accuses the pilgrims that they spared in their lust neither age nor sex, nor religious profession, and that they committed fornication, adultery, and incest in open day (in oculis omnium), \\"abandoning matrons and virgins dedicated to God to the lewdness of grooms.\\" And yet this great pope insulted the Eastern church by the establishment of a Latin hierarchy on the ruins of the Byzantine empire. and converting them to Latin Catholic worship. Various holy artifacts from these Orthodox holy places were then taken to the West. This event and the final treaty established the Latin Empire of the East and the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople (with various other Crusader states). This period of rule over the Byzantine Empire is known among Eastern Orthodox as Frangokratia (dominion by the Franks). An attempt by the Latin Empire to capture the city of Adrianople, then a Bulgarian possession, was defeated in the Battle of Adrianople (1205). In northern Europe, the Teutonic Knights, after their successes in the northern crusades, attempted to conquer the Orthodox Russian Republics of Pskov and Novgorod, an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX. One of the major defeats they suffered was the Battle of the Ice in 1242. Sweden also undertook several campaigns against Orthodox Novgorod. There were also conflicts between Catholic Poland and Orthodox Russia. Such conflicts solidified the schism between East and West. =Second Council of Lyon (1272)= The Second Council of Lyon was convoked to act on a pledge by Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII to reunite the Eastern church with the West.Wetterau, Bruce. World history. New York: Henry Holt and company. 1994. Wishing to end the Great Schism, Gregory X had sent an embassy to Michael VIII, who had reconquered Constantinople, putting an end to the remnants of the Latin Empire in the East, and he asked Latin despots in the East to curb their ambitions. On 29 June (Feast of Saints Peter and Paul patronal feast of Popes), Gregory X celebrated a Mass in St John's Church, where both sides took part. The council declared that the Roman church possessed \\"the supreme and full primacy and authority over the universal Catholic Church.\\" The council was seemingly a success but did not provide a lasting solution to the schism; the emperor was anxious to heal the schism, but the Eastern clergy proved to be obstinate. In 1275, Patriarch Joseph I Galesiotes of Constantinople abdicated and was replaced by John XI Bekkos, a convert to the cause of union. In spite of a sustained campaign by Bekkos to defend the union intellectually, and vigorous and brutal repression of opponents by Michael, the vast majority of Byzantine Christians remained implacably opposed to union with the Latin \\"heretics\\". Michael's death in December 1282 put an end to the union of Lyons. His son and successor Andronicus II repudiated the union, and Bekkos was forced to abdicate, being exiled and imprisoned until his death in 1297. =Council of Ferrara-Florence (1439)= In the 15th century, the Eastern Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, pressed hard by the Ottoman Turks, was keen to ally himself with the West, and to do so he arranged with Pope Eugene IV for discussions about reunion to be held again, this time at the Council of Ferrara-Florence. After several long discussions, the emperor managed to convince the Eastern representatives to accept the Western doctrines of filioque, purgatory and the supremacy of the papacy. On 6 June 1439, an agreement was signed by all the Eastern bishops present but one, Mark of Ephesus, who held that Rome continued in both heresy and schism. It seemed that the Great Schism had been ended. However, upon their return, the Eastern bishops found their agreement with the West broadly rejected by the populace and by civil authorities (with the notable exception of the emperors of the East who remained committed to union until the Fall of Constantinople two decades later). The union signed at Florence has never been accepted by the Eastern churches. Twentieth century and beyond =Eastern Catholicism= The Eastern Catholic Churches consider themselves to have reconciled the East and West Schism by keeping their prayers and rituals similar to those of Eastern Orthodoxy, while also accepting the primacy of the Bishop of Rome. Some Eastern Orthodox charge that joining in this unity comes at the expense of ignoring critical doctrinal differences and past atrocities. Since the beginnings of the Uniate movement, there have been periodic conflicts between the Orthodox and Uniate in Ukraine and Belarus, then under Polish rule, and later also in Transylvania (see the Romanian Church United with Rome). During Russia's Time of Troubles there was a plan by the conquering Polish monarchy (of Latin Rite, not Uniate) to convert all of Russia to Roman Catholicism. The Russian national holiday, Unity Day, was established because of this conflict. Patriarch Hermogenes was martyred by the Poles and their supporters during this period (see also Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìMuscovite Commonwealth).Reverend R Thornton. Lives of Eminent Russian Prelates. Kessinger Publishing, 2004. .

A History of the Church of Russia, 1842, reprinted 2004. . Page 166. Similar pressure was also used by the Orthodox against Eastern Catholic Churches such as the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.The Ukrainian Greek Catholics: A Historical Survey. Risu.org.ua. Retrieved on 2012-06-02. At a meeting in Balamand, Lebanon in June 1993, the Joint International Commission for the Theological Dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church the delegates of the Eastern Orthodox Churches declared \\"...and that what has been called 'uniatism' can no longer be accepted either as a method to be followed nor as a model of the unity our Churches are seeking\\" (section 12 of the document). At the same time, the Commission stated: * Concerning the Eastern Catholic Churches, it is clear that they, as part of the Catholic Communion, have the right to exist and to act in response to the spiritual needs of their faithful. * The Oriental Catholic Churches who have desired to re-establish full communion with the See of Rome and have remained faithful to it, have the rights and obligations which are connected with this communion. Vatican Councils The doctrine of papal primacy was further developed in 1870 at the First Vatican Council which declared that \\"in the disposition of God the Roman church holds the preeminence of ordinary power over all the other churches\\". This council also affirmed the dogma of papal infallibility, declaring that the infallibility of the Christian community extends to the pope, when he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church. A major event of the Second Vatican Council, known as Vatican II, was the issuance by Pope Paul VI and Orthodox Patriarch Athenagoras of a joint expression of regret for many of the past actions that had led up to the Great Schism, expressed as the Catholic-Orthodox Joint declaration of 1965. At the same time, they lifted the mutual excommunications dating from the 11th century.Joint Declaration Recent efforts at reconciliation On June 29, 1995, Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople again withdrew the excommunications imposed in the 11th century and concelebrated the Eucharist together. In May 1999, John Paul II was the first pope since the Great Schism to visit an Eastern Orthodox country: Romania. Upon greeting John Paul II, the Romanian Patriarch Teoctist stated: \\"The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity.\\" Pope John Paul II visited other heavily Orthodox areas such as Ukraine, despite lack of welcome at times, and he said that healing the divisions between Western and Eastern Christianity was one of his fondest wishes. The Roman Catholic Church recently has shown some flexibility on the Filioque issue. In accordance with the Roman Catholic Church's practice of including the clause when reciting the Creed in Latin,Missale Romanum 2002 (Roman Missal in Latin), p. 513 but not when reciting the Creed in Greek,Œ°œâŒºŒ±œäŒ∫œå ŒõŒµŒπœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œå 2006 (Roman Missal in Greek), vol. 1, p. 347 Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have recited the Nicene Creed jointly with Patriarchs Demetrius I and Bartholomew I in Greek without the Filioque clause.Video recording of joint recitationprogramme of the celebration Pope, Patriarch appeal for unityAsia NewsDemetrius I CNS The action of these patriarchs in reciting the creed together with the popes has been strongly criticized by some elements of Eastern Orthodoxy, such as the Metropolitan of Kalavryta, Greece in November 2008.The Metropolitan's own blog, reported also by this Religious News Agency and the Russian Orthodox See also * Western Christianity * Eastern Christianity * Western Rite Orthodoxy References Bibliography   * Aidan Nichols.

Harding the previous evening. The inauguration ‚Äì the sixth non-scheduled, extraordinary inauguration to ever take place ‚Äì marked the commencement of the first term (a partial term of ) of Calvin Coolidge as President. The presidential oath of office was administered to the new president by his father, John Calvin Coolidge Sr., who was a Vermont notary public and justice of the peace.Calvin Coolidge, Bartleby.com: http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres47.html On Tuesday, August 21, 1923, President Coolidge repeated the oath before Justice Adolph A. Hoehling Jr. of the Court of the District of Columbia at the Willard Hotel, Washington, D.C. Midnight, August 2‚Äì3, 1923 Vice President Coolidge was visiting his family homestead in Vermont, which did not have electricity or a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death.Fuess, Claude Moore, \\"Calvin Coolidge: The Man from Vermont,\\" Little, Brown, 1940, 308‚Äì309 As the new president, Coolidge intended to take the oath of office and greet reporters who had assembled outside. He dressed in an upstairs bedroom, said a prayer, and came downstairs. In front of a small group of observers, including Coolidge's wife Grace and United States Representative Porter H. Dale, his father, John Calvin Coolidge Sr., a Vermont notary public and justice of the peace, administered the oath of office. The swearing in took place in John Coolidge's family parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47 a.m. on August 3, 1923; President Coolidge then went back to bed. Dale was campaigning for the United States Senate when he heard of Harding's death. He traveled to John Coolidge's home with reporter Joe Fountain, Herbert P. Thompson, the commander of Springfield's American Legion Post, and labor union official L. L. Lane. Dale had intended to ensure that Calvin Coolidge was informed that Harding had died, and to offer any assistance he could provide. As a result, Fountain was the only reporter present for the oath-taking. By most accounts, it was Dale who suggested persistently that Coolidge be sworn in immediately to ensure continuity in the presidency. Dale later wrote an account of this event which was published as a magazine article.Bill Harris, The First Ladies Fact Book, 2012, page 456Glenn D. Kittler, Hail to the Chief!: The Inauguration Days of our Presidents, 1965, page 167Porter H. Dale, The Calvin Coolidge Inauguration Revisited: An Eyewitness Account by Congressman Porter H.

Albert W. Harvey, the United States Marshal for the District of Vermont, arrived in Plymouth about three hours after Coolidge was sworn in. Swiftly deputizing several local residents, he took the initiative to provide a bodyguard detail for Coolidge. The guards remained with Coolidge until Secret Service agents from Boston took over the duty after they caught up to his train in Rutland while he was returning to Washington, D.C. The second oath Coolidge returned to Washington the next day, and Justice Adolph A. Hoehling Jr. of the Court of the District of Columbia administered the oath a second time, on August 21, 1923, as there was a question about whether a state official had the authority to administer the federal presidential oath.Fuess, 310‚Äì315 The United States Constitution requires the President to take an oath at the beginning of his term, but it does not identify the person or officer who is to administer the oath.U.S. Const. art. II, s. 1 It is traditional for the Chief Justice of the United States to administer the oath, but that is not a constitutional requirement. When George Washington was sworn in on April 30, 1789, neither the Supreme Court nor any other part of the federal judiciary had been created. The oath was administered by Robert Livingston, a New York state judicial officer. Hoehling kept the second swearing-in a secret until confirming Harry M. Daugherty's revelation of it in 1932. When Hoehling confirmed Daugherty's story, he indicated that Daugherty, then serving as United States Attorney General, asked him to administer the oath at the Willard Hotel. According to Hoehling, he did not question Daugherty's reason for requesting a second oath-taking, but assumed it was to resolve any doubt about whether the first swearing-in was valid, since it had been administered by a state official.

She was abducted on July 22, 2002 from a Philadelphia sidewalk, at 7 years old. There was one witness present, a 6-year-old child named Rani Byrd. Rani tried to help Erica but was pushed to the ground before two men pulled off. When Erica's grandmother called for Erica and her sister, a crying Rani stated that Erica had been kidnapped, but her sister was around the corner. Erica's abductors bound her hands and feet and held her captive in a vacant house until she was able to free herself by gnawing at the tape on her wrists and then smashing a window, a day after the kidnapping. Both Pratt's bravery and the media's handling of the situation attracted considerable attention. Reaction and recognition Philadelphia's police inspector William Colarulo commented on Pratt's escape from captivity, stating, \\"I have twenty-one years in the Police Department, and I have never seen this kind of heroic act of bravery committed by a seven-year-old.\\" Her problem-solving and actions, including her cries for help, have been cited as lessons for others and as an inspiration for African American leadership. She was named Time's Person of the Week \\"as a reminder that not all abductions end in tears\\". In May 2003, United States Attorney General John Ashcroft presented her with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's National Courage Award \\"for her unyielding persistence and boldness.\\" In a year that had already seen several other high-profile kidnappings, including Danielle van Dam, Samantha Runnion and Elizabeth Smart, Pratt's story caused several media outlets to consider whether these crimes were actually becoming more commonplace, concluding that reporting was distorting perceptions of their frequency. This case, especially in comparison to those earlier in the year, led to suggestions that the media was selectively reporting about victims on the basis of racial or social class grounds, a claim sometimes generalised as missing white woman syndrome. Salon writer Margot Magowan also suggested the non-sexual nature of the Pratt kidnapping contributed to the media's attention. If raped women were granted the same status as Erica Pratt,\\" she wrote, \\"there would be no reflex to make them disappear.\\" Kidnappers Edward Johnson, who performed the physical kidnapping, and James Burns, the getaway driver, were arrested three days after the kidnapping, which they had committed in an effort to collect ransom money from Pratt's grandmother. Johnson pleaded guilty in May 2003 while Burns was convicted a month later. The kidnappers asked for a $150,000 ransom after a rumor spread about the family getting life insurance after their uncle got shot and killed.

Study rationale  JUPITER was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study investigating the use of rosuvastatin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The trial focused on patients with normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels but increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). JUPITER was the first clinical trial to indicate that statin therapy may provide benefit to patients with low-to-normal LDL levels and no known cardiovascular disease.\\"JUPITER: Using hsCRP to identify primary prevention patients who may benefit from statin therapy\\", Endocrine Today, 25 November 2008 The trial, which began in 2003, was directed by Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital.JUPITER trial information page, Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital Because half of all vascular events occur in patients with normal or low levels of LDL cholesterol, JUPITER was designed to determine whether hs-CRP testing could identify these patients, and whether statin therapy could prevent cardiovascular events among them. Elevated hs-CRP levels are thought to be a biomarker of inflammation, and have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and sudden cardiac death.  Study details  The trial analyzed 17,802 patients without evidence of heart disease but with high CRP levels. In 2008, results presented at the American Heart Association meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) found that patients with low-to-normal LDL cholesterol receiving rosuvastatin had a lower rate of major cardiovascular events. Compared to patients taking a placebo, patients given rosuvastatin had reductions in LDL and CRP levels, and a reduction of 0.2% to 0.6% in their absolute risk of heart attack, stroke, and death at one year.\\"To combat plaques, research targets inflammation-fighting statins\\", Los Angeles Times, 8 December 2008\\"Treating elevated C-reactive protein with a statin\\", Endocrine Today, 1 December 2008 The study's authors estimated that the number needed to treat with rosuvastatin to prevent one cardiovascular event was 95 over two years, extrapolated to 25 over five years. The trial was stopped early, after just 1.9 years median duration, by the study's Independent Data Monitoring Board, because the interim results met the study's predefined stopping criteria (it had been predetermined that it would be unethical to continue the study once it became clear that the patients in one arm of the study had a significantly higher cardiovascular risk than the other arm's patients). The trial was sponsored by AstraZeneca, the marketer of Crestor (rosuvastatin). The company saw an increase in its share of the U.S. statin drug market following the November 2008 NEJM publication.\\"Astra's Crestor gets sales boost after positive data\\", Reuters, 24 November 2008 = Adverse events = Reports of serious adverse events within JUPITER were equally distributed between the study's rosuvastatin and placebo arms. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups with respect to muscle pain, muscle weakness, hepatic function, or renal function; however, the researchers noted small but statistically significant increases in the rate of physician-reported diabetes and glycated hemoglobin values in the rosuvastatin group, an effect that has also been seen in studies with other statins. Those latter findings, along with concerns over the safety of very low LDL levels, rosuvastatin's higher cost compared to generic statins, and the validity of biomarkers used in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, have been cited by those urging caution before expanding indications for statin treatment.\\"Dramatic JUPITER Findings Fail to Sway Prescribing Behavior, Poll Shows\\", press release, MarketWatch, 25 November 2008 A Specific Critique of the Jupiter study and Contrasting results from other studies  In 2010, Dr. Michel de Lorgeril, et al., published \\"a critical reappraisal\\" of the JUPITER Trial in the Archives of Internal Medicine . The article's authors critiqued what they saw as flaws in the trial, pointing out that the cardiovascular mortality rate and the case- fatality rate for myocardial infarction were much lower than they expected. They also raised concerns about conflict of interest in the trial design and leadership: nine of 14 authors of the main report had financial ties to the sponsor, AstraZeneca, and the lead investigator held the patent for the C-reactive protein test, whose use in screening would be promoted by the results as reported. They also argued that the trial's premature termination may have distorted the results, and raised concerns that AstraZeneca scientists had controlled and managed the raw data. They concluded that, \\"The results of the trial do not support the use of statin treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and raise troubling questions concerning the role of commercial sponsors.\\" In addition, some prior and some subsequent studies have contrasted with the JUPITER trial results. On the role of C-reactive protein, a 2009 study employing Mendelian randomization, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested that CRP does not play a causal role in cardiovascular disease; the results may argue against CRP's use as a marker of cardiovascular disease risk or for identifying subjects for statin therapy as in JUPITER, and more strongly argue against using CRP as a therapeutic target per se. The discordant results of this subsequent study provoked debate over the role and value of CRP as a biomarker and possible therapeutic target in heart disease.

Legend has it that the station's name (Ford of the Saints) is derived from the nearby ford where two of Anglesey's most famous saints, Cybi and Seiriol are said to have met from time to time. Opening in 1908 it was a very simple station with only one short (60 ft) platform on the Down (north-west) side and a wooden waiting hut. It was an unstaffed request stop with no goods yard or sidings.Jones, Geraint: Anglesey Railways, page 81. Carreg Gwalch, 2005 Access to the station was via a short flight of steps from the minor road passing above the station. A look at any modern or contemporary Ordnance Survey map will show that this, along with the preceding station Ceint are perhaps two of the most remote on the island. The station closed in 1930, as did the line itself to passenger trains, and the station building removed. The tracks themselves were taken up in 1953 and very little evidence remains of the station, the overgrown platform being just about visible.Jones, Geraint: Anglesey Railways, page 104.

The wheel spider is a nocturnal, free-ranging hunter, coming out at night to prey on insects and other small invertebrates. Its bite is mildly venomous, but the spider is not known to be harmful to humans. The wheel spider does not produce a web. Its principal line of defence against predation is to bury itself in a silk-lined burrow extending 40‚Äì50 cm deep. During the process of digging its burrow, the spider can shift up to of sand, 80,000 times its body weight. It is during the initial stages of building a burrow that the spider is vulnerable to pompilid wasps, which will sting and paralyze the spider before planting eggs in its body. If the spider is unable to fight off a wasp, and if it is on a sloped dune, it will use its rolling speed of to escape. References * (2009): The world spider catalog, version 9.5.

Before Christmas in 1962, as Charlie Daniels was driving from El Paso, Texas to the East Coast, he began forming the idea that would become the song. Afterwards Bob Johnston invited him to Nashville to co-write songs. They finished the song together. Daniels recalled: \\"We just went on, and we finished it up, and Bob did a demo on it, and the company that he was writing for at the time-Hill and Range was the parent company-handled Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, which was Elvis Presley's two companies.\\"Songfacts.

So anyway, he recorded it, and it was by far the biggest thing that had ever happened to me in my life.\\" Although he never met Elvis Presley, Daniels did meet his daughter, Lisa Marie, at an event in Memphis: \\"I just got to tell her, I said, 'You know your dad picked one of my songs.

He was President of Citibank (the predecessor to Citigroup) from 1959-1967 and later Chairman from 1967-1970. He was succeeded by Walter B. Wriston who was President from 1967-1970. In 1963 Moore led an early effort by multinational corporations to create the world's first private investment company to promote the economic development of Latin America. This effort led to the formation of the Adela Investment Company in September 1964 and Moore served as a director. Moore was President of the Metropolitan Opera Association in 1967 and dealt with financial problems as the company entered Lincoln Center. Cost-saving measures included raising ticket prices, delaying the season and eliminating free summer concerts in Central Park. Moore was the sole representative for financial interests of the Onassis family in the United States. In 1987 he wrote \\"The Banker's Life\\" detailing his experiences at the bank.

Richards played in all four matches, though was initially dropped for the final match of the tournament against France.

Though rice is the prime crop of the district, the agricultural economy largely depends on potato, jute, vegetables and orchard products. Vegetable is a prize crop in the blocks of Haripal, Singur, Chanditala, Polba and Dhaniakhali being grown in a relay system throughout the year. Though potato is cultivated in all the blocks of this district Dhaniakhali, Arambagh, Goghat, Pursurah, Haripal, Polba-Dadpur, Tarakeswar, Pandua and Singur contributed much of its production of this district. Some of the primary and other hats or markets in the Haripal block area are: Basudevpur hat, Bondipur hat, Dar hatta hat, Jejur Daily Market, Kaikala hat, Kalchara hat, Nalikul hat, Sipaigachi hat, Jagin market, Haripal Barabazar and Haripal Station Bazar. People Atulya Ghosh, freedom fighter and once the strongman of the Congress Party, was born at Jejur on 28 August 1904. Also, Shree Bijoy Krishna Mitra is a prominent figure from Jejur who traversed all over the country and contributed immensely to the infrastructure building of the nation along with his village development. His long association with HCC has been well recognised. Education Jajur High School is a boys only higher secondary school. It has arrangements for teaching Bengali, English, Sanskrit, history, philosophy, political science, economics and mathematics.

Previously known as Lochbay, it is in the council area of Highland. History In 1790, the British Fisheries Society planned a fishing port to be designed by Thomas Telford. However, poor management of the project, and the lack of enthusiasm shown by the local crofting population for fishing, meant only a small proportion of the scheme was constructed. By 1837 the Society had made a loss of ¬£3,000 and seven years later it sold off the land it had acquired. Only a few structures were completed to Telford's design, including a pier of 1796‚Äì1802, a storehouse of 1795 (now converted to housing), and possibly the now-ruined smithy of 1799.\\"Skye, Lochbay, Stein, General\\" Scotland's Places.

Local area The Fairy Bridge on the B888 The village of Dunvegan lies approximately south along the B888 road. Near the junction of this road with the A850, just from Stein is the Fairy Bridge. According to tradition as related by R.C. MacLeod one of the chiefs of Clan MacLeod married a fairy; however, after twenty years she is forced to leave him and return to fairyland. She bade farewell to the chief at the Fairy Bridge and gave him the Fairy Flag. She promised that if it was waved in times of danger and distress, help would be given on three occasions. A similar tradition, related by John Arnott MacCulloch, stated that although the fairy's gift had the power to save both her husband and his clan, afterwards an invisible being would come to take both the flag and its bearer awaynever to be seen again.

XtratuM is released as free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or any later. Professional versions are commercialized by fentISS under a proprietary license. XtratuM is a hypervisor designed for embedded systems to meet safety critical real-time requirements. It provides a framework to run several operating systems (or real-time executives) in a robust partitioned environment. XtratuM can be used to build a MILS (Multiple Independent Levels of Security) architecture.  History  The name XtratuM derives from the word stratum. In geology and related fields it means: :Layer of rock or soil with internally consistent characteristics that distinguishes it from contiguous layers. In order to stress the tight relation with Linux and the open-source movements, the ‚ÄúS‚Äù was replaced by ‚ÄúX‚Äù. XtratuM would be the first layer of software (the one closest to the hardware), which provides a solid basis for the rest of the system. XtratuM 1.0 was initially designed as a substitution of the RTLinux HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to meet temporal and spatial partitioning requirements. The goal was to virtualize the essential hardware devices to execute several OSes concurrently, with at least one of these OSes being a RTOS. The other hardware devices (including booting) were left to a special domain, named root domain. After this experience, it was redesigned to be independent of Linux and bootable. The result of this is XtratuM 2.0 which is type 1 hypervisor that uses para-virtualization. The para-virtualized operations are as close to the hardware as possible. Therefore, porting an operating system that already works on the native system is a simple task: replace some parts of the operating system HAL with the corresponding hypercalls.  Overview  The design of a hypervisor for critical real-time embedded systems follows these criteria: * Strong temporal isolation: fixed cyclic scheduler. * Strong spatial isolation: all partitions are executed in processor user mode, and do not share memory. * Basic resource virtualization: clock and timers, interrupts, memory, CPU and special devices. * Real-time scheduling policy for partition scheduling. * Efficient context switch for partitions. * Deterministic hypercalls (hypervisor system calls). * Health monitoring support. * Robust and efficient inter-partition communication mechanisms (sampling and queuing ports). * Low overhead. * Small size. * Static system definition via configuration file (XML). In the case of embedded systems, particularly avionics systems, the ARINC 653 standard defines a partitioning scheme. Although this standard was not designed to describe how a hypervisor must operate, some parts of the model are quite close to the functionality provided by a hypervisor. The XtratuM API and internal operations resemble the ARINC 653 standard. XtratuM is not an ARINC 653 compliant system. The standard relies on the idea of a separation kernel defining both the API and operations of the partitions and also how the threads or processes are managed inside each partition. XtratuM hypervisor supports the LEON 2/LEON 3/LEON 4 (SPARCv8) and Cortex R4/Cortex R5/Cortex A9 (ARMv7) architectures. XtratuM support as execution environments: * XAL (XtratuM Abstraction Layer) for bare-C applications * POSIX PSE51 Partikle RTOS * ARINC-653 P1 compliant LITHOS RTOS * ARINC-653 P4 compliant uLITHOS runtime * Ada Ravenscar profile ORK+ * RTEMS * Linux  See also  * Kernel- based Virtual Machine * L4 microkernels * Xen * Paravirtualization * Nanokernel  References  External links * XtratuM Official Page * fentISS Free virtualization software Virtualization-related software for Linux ","title":"XtratuM"},{"id":"21200689","text":"Pipe Creek Friends Meetinghouse is a historic Friends meeting house located at Union Bridge, Carroll County, Maryland, United States.

November 2004. Polar seas is a collective term for the Arctic Ocean (about 4-5 percent of Earth's oceans) and the southern part of the Southern Ocean (south of Antarctic Convergence, about 10 percent of Earth's oceans). In the coldest years, sea ice can cover around 13 percent of the Earth's total surface at its maximum, but out of phase in the two hemispheres. The polar seas contain a huge biome with many organisms. Among the species that inhabit various polar seas and surrounding land areas are polar bear, reindeer (caribou), muskox, wolverine, ermine, lemming, Arctic hare, Arctic ground squirrel, whale, harp seal, and walrus. These species have unique adaptations to the extreme conditions. Many might be endangered if they cannot adapt to changing conditions. Contrary to popular opinion, the World Wildlife Fund studies for polar bears show that this species has prospered since 1950, attaining five times the numbers found in 1950. In general, Arctic ecosystems are relatively fragile and slow to recover from serious damage. Arctic A large amount of the land in the north polar region is part of Earth's tundra biome. South of the Arctic tundra, where temperatures are a little less cold, are the vast forests of conifer trees of the taiga biome. North of the Arctic tundra are polar bears and the unique marine life of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic ocean has relatively abundant plant life. Nutrients from rivers along with mixing and upwelling from storms contribute mixed layer nutrients which are essential for Arctic phytoplankton development. During summer, nearly continuous solar insolation encourages phytoplankta blooms. The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by continents and has a few narrow, relatively shallow connections to the large ocean basins to the south. Large amounts of riverine fresh water as well as abundant nutrients (gelbstoff) flow into the Arctic basin from Siberian rivers. The widest continental shelf on the planet is found in the Arctic Ocean, extending more than 1000 kilometers outward from Siberia and Alaska. Consequently, much of the basin is very shallow. On the other hand, the Arctic Ocean contains the deepest, slowest spreading mid-ocean ridge on the planet which, until 2003, was thought to be inactive volcanically. Since then, however, a dozen active volcanoes have been discovered, illustrating the limited information available for the difficult- to-study Arctic Ocean. The numerous Siberian rivers flowing onto the shallow continental shelf freshen the seawater. These rivers have shown increased flow recently, possibly due to increased global rainfall as a result of climate change. A flow increase may raise the level of riverine nutrients. Severe Siberian drought, as experienced in 2010, could, however, decrease flows. There is an interest in a potential release of methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas, from methane clathrates present in the Arctic continental shelf sediments, if sufficient ocean warming were to occur. As much as 80% of the ocean surface is covered by ice in winter, declining to about 60% in summer; ice cover has been declining at a steady and rapid pace. A large fraction of the ice is multi-year ice, and in the far North the thickness can be more than 2m. In summer, ice tends to melt at the air-sea interface. Surface melt ponds are formed, increasing the albedo. Antarctic Most of Antarctica is covered with a thick layer of ice, with few species permanently living in the ice-covered areas. There are many species of penguins in the south polar region. Almost all animals in Antarctica find their food in the Southern Ocean surrounding the continent, and there is abundant marine life in the Southern Ocean. Because of the extreme but constant habitats, small disruption or damage could alter the polar systems. Although they are remote from human world, polar seas are not 'pristine' environments. Compared with the Antarctic region, the Arctic has long history of interaction with man. The polar food web structure can be sensitive to man's 'top-down' control especially with the development and growth of industrial fishing. Climate change is a natural phenomenon that influences life in polar areas. There is observational evidence that the Antarctica climate is a bellwether for climate change in the northern hemisphere, leading by about 1000 years. The study of Antarctic ice, its distribution, changes in ice volume, and other indicators of the continental climate in Antarctica are at an early stage of development and even earlier stage of understanding. Techniques for studying the terrain beneath the ice are just being explored. Lake Vostok, buried under miles of ice, has not been penetrated to date. There is evidence that it has been out of contact with the atmosphere for millions of years, making it a possible treasure trove of information. Arctic Ocean Antarctic and Southern Ocean Relatively, the Antarctic seas and Southern ocean surround the highest, driest, coldest and windiest continent on the earth - Antarctica. Due to the low mean temperature, there is no riverine input into the Antarctic seas. And little input DOM, POC from land. In addition to relatively thin sea ice, thick and extensive ice shelves (floating glaciers) are present in the Antarctic region. More than 90% of the sea ice is first year (annual) ice and less than 2m thick. The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can date back to the 1820.  Role in global climate  The polar seas play an important role in the global climate: * Carbon export/carbon sequestration: Effects concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. * Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP/DMS) production: DMSP/DMS serves as the nucleus in cloud formation and changes the regional albedo and precipitation. * Earth's energy budget: clouds increase albedo, sea-ice increases albedo, ice shelves increase albedo etc. *Formation of deep and bottom waters: the polar areas are the source of ocean deep and bottom cold waters. Due to the sinking of cold and dense saline waters near Greenland, and at the Antarctic Convergence, among other sites, the global ocean circulation is maintained. Models predict a latitudinal effect in response to climate change. These would be expected to be first obvious in polar and subpolar regions. The decline of arctic ocean summer ice coverage was assumed to be one such sign, however, the reversal of that trend leaves the question open as the origins of the now reversed 30 year trend. In 1979, the cover of Time magazine was illustrated with an image of arctic ice covering and expanding BEYOND the arctic basin, opinion seems to have little value. Real data reveal the trend of ice coverage to be on the increase. If this increase will continue, only time will tell. Developed nations ceased the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons and the atmospheric abundance and consequent ozone depletion are generally on the decrease. ozone hole Breaking-off of polar ice shelves is a continuing process with increases in Western Antarctica balanced by decreases in Eastern Antarctica. Careful study has revealed that the volume of ice in Western Antarctica was incorrectly estimated and shows no significant change attributable to climate change over the observation period.  Characteristics  Extreme oscillations in irradiance occur in these regions, for months it may be totally dark (in winter) or light (in summer). Because of the existence of polar ice, surface reflectance of sunlight is very high. In addition the solar angle are relatively quite low. So less light can penetrate into water and becomes bio available to the plants in polar water under the ice cover. Water temperatures are low, but do not change much seasonally. The low temperature and low available high irradiance together limit primary production. Major nutrients (N, P, Si) are often not limiting primary production. Blooming of Phytoplankton happens in summer, because of the decreased salinity (sea ice melt-water), lower mixing, higher stratification, higher temperature and more bio available light. Ice is very important in structuring environment. It regulates the physics, chemistry and biology of the water column, air-sea exchange, and is also an important habitat.  Development  There is an expected rise in the exploration and development of the Polar Seas due to an increasing demand for fuel and commodities. The emergence of China and India's economy is considered one of the main drivers of this phenomenon due to an unprecedented appetite for raw materials and fuel. Presently, there are still no exact figures that define the oil and gas reserves in the Polar Seas. Initial explorations, however, have resulted in the identification of its potential. For example, Canada's explorations discovered gas and oil in several Arctic locations such as Beaufort, High Arctic (Arctic Islands), Labrador, and Newfoundland. The Arctic Islands alone has an estimated 4.3 billion barrels of oil reserve while those locations that fall within the Alaskan continental shelf have potential recoverable reserves worth $18 billion.Polar Research Board, p. 246. There are now 46 nations that are parties to cooperation and treaties covering the polar regions. Several of these, either individually or with partners, conduct research and explorations in the Arctic and Antarctic seas. These activities are governed by international environmental protocols. However, countries like China, which faces a future oil shortage, are aggressively exploring the region for the purpose of oil extraction despite an international ban on such activity.

The bias ratio is a concrete metric that detects valuation bias or deliberate price manipulation of portfolio assets by a manager of a hedge fund, mutual fund or similar investment vehicle, without requiring disclosure (transparency) of the actual holdings. This metric measures abnormalities in the distribution of returns that indicate the presence of bias in subjective pricing. The formulation of the Bias Ratio stems from an insight into the behavior of asset managers as they address the expectations of investors with the valuation of assets that determine their performance. The bias ratio measures how far the returns from an investment portfolio ‚Äì e.g. one managed by a hedge fund ‚Äì are from an unbiased distribution. Thus the bias ratio of a pure equity index will usually be close to 1. However, if a fund smooths its returns using subjective pricing of illiquid assets the bias ratio will be higher. As such, it can help identify the presence of illiquid securities where they are not expected. The bias ratio was first defined by Adil Abdulali, a risk manager at the investment firm Prot√©g√© Partners. The concepts behind the bias ratio were formulated between 2001 and 2003 and privately used to screen money managers. The first public discussions on the subject took place in 2004 at New York University's Courant Institute and in 2006 at Columbia University.Courant Institute StudyColumbia University Study The bias ratio has since been used by a number of Risk Management professionals to spot suspicious funds that subsequently turned out to be frauds. The most spectacular example of this was reported in the Financial Times on 22 January 2009 titled \\"Bias ratio seen to unmask Madoff\\"!Bias ratio seen to unmask Madoff (Financial Times 22 January 2009) Explanation Imagine that you are a hedge fund manager who invests in securities that are hard to value, such as mortgage-backed securities. Your peer group consists of funds with similar mandates, and all have track records with high Sharpe ratios, very few down months, and investor demand from the \\"[one per cent per month]\\" crowd. You are keenly aware that your potential investors look carefully at the characteristics of returns, including such calculations as the percentage of months with negative and positive returns. Furthermore, assume that no pricing service can reliably price your portfolio, and the assets are often sui generis with no quoted market. In order to price the portfolio for return calculations, you poll dealers for prices on each security monthly and get results that vary widely on each asset. The following real-world example illustrates this theoretical construct. When pricing this portfolio, standard market practice allows a manager to discard outliers and average the remaining prices. But what constitutes an outlier? Market participants contend that outliers are difficult to characterize methodically and thus use the heuristic rule \\"you know it when you see it.\\" Visible outliers consider the particular security‚Äôs characteristics and liquidity as well as the market environment in which quotes are solicited. After discarding outliers, a manager sums up the relevant figures and determines the net asset value (\\"NAV\\"). Now let‚Äôs consider what happens when this NAV calculation results in a small monthly loss, such as -0.01%. Lo and behold, just before the CFO publishes the return, an aspiring junior analyst notices that the pricing process included a dealer quote 50% below all the other prices for that security. Throwing out that one quote would raise the monthly return to +0.01%. A manager with high integrity faces two pricing alternatives. Either the manager can close the books, report the -0.01% return, and ignore new information, ensuring the consistency of the pricing policy (Option 1) or the manager can accept the improved data, report the +0.01% return, and document the reasons for discarding the quote (Option 2). The smooth blue histogram represents a manager who employed Option 1, and the kinked red histogram represents a manager who chose Option 2 in those critical months. Given the proclivity of Hedge Fund investors for consistent, positive monthly returns, many a smart businessman might choose Option 2, resulting in more frequent small positive results and far fewer small negative ones than in Option 1. The \\"reserve\\" that allows \\"false positives\\" with regularity is evident in the unusual hump at the -1.5 Standard Deviation point. This psychology is summed up in a phrase often heard on trading desks on Wall Street, \\"let us take the pain now!\\" The geometry of this behavior in figure 1 is the area in between the blue line and the red line from -1œÉ to 0.0, which has been displaced, like toothpaste squeezed from a tube, farther out into negative territory. By itself, such a small cover up might not concern some beyond the irritation of misstated return volatility. However, the empirical evidence that justifies using a \\"slippery slope\\" argument here includes almost every mortgage backed fund that has blown up because of valuation problems, such as the Safe Harbor fund, and equity funds such as the Bayou fund. Both funds ended up perpetrating outright fraud born from minor cover ups. More generally, financial history has several well-known examples where hiding small losses eventually led to fraud such as the Sumitomo copper affair as well as the demise of Barings Bank. Mathematical formulation Although the hump at -œÉ is difficult to model, behavior induced modifications manifest themselves in the shape of the return histogram around a small neighborhood of zero. It is approximated by a straightforward formula. Let: [0, +œÉ] = the closed interval from zero to +1 standard deviation of returns (including zero) Let: [-œÉ, 0) = the half open interval from -1 standard deviation of returns to zero (including -œÉ and excluding zero) Let: :r_i = return in month i, 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n, and n = number of monthly returns Then: :\\\\mathrm{Bias\\\\ Ratio} = \\\\mathrm{BR} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Count} (r_i r_i \\\\in [0, \\\\sigma] )}{1+\\\\mathrm{Count}(r_i r_i \\\\in [-\\\\sigma, 0))} The bias ratio roughly approximates the ratio between the area under the return histogram near zero in the first quadrant and the similar area in the second quadrant. It holds the following properties: : a. 0 \\\\leq \\\\mathrm{BR} \\\\leq n : b. If r_i < 0, \\\\forall{i}, then BR = 0 : c. If \\\\forall{r_i} such that r_i > 0,\\\\ r_i > \\\\sigma then BR = 0 : d. If the distribution r_i is Normal with mean = 0, then BR approaches 1 as n goes to infinity. The bias ratio defined by a 1œÉ interval around zero works well to discriminate amongst hedge funds. Other intervals provide metrics with varying resolutions, but these tend towards 0 as the interval shrinks. Examples and context =Natural bias ratios of asset returns= The bias ratios of market and hedge fund indices gives some insight into the natural shape of returns near zero. Theoretically one would not expect demand for markets with normally distributed returns around a zero mean. Such markets have distributions with a bias ratio of less than 1.0. Major market indices support this intuition and have bias ratios generally greater than 1.0 over long time periods. The returns of equity and fixed income markets as well as alpha generating strategies have a natural positive skew that manifests in a smoothed return histogram as a positive slope near zero. Fixed income strategies with a relatively constant positive return (\\"carry\\") also exhibit total return series with a naturally positive slope near zero. Cash investments such as 90-day T-Bills have large bias ratios, because they generally do not experience periodic negative returns. Consequently, the bias ratio is less reliable for the theoretic hedge fund that has an un-levered portfolio with a high cash balance. Due diligence, due to the inverted x and y axes, involves manipulation and instigation and extortion etc. Contrast to other metrics =Vs. Sharpe ratios= Since the Sharpe ratio measures risk- adjusted returns, and valuation biases are expected to understate volatility, one might reasonably expect a relationship between the two. For example, an unexpectedly high Sharpe ratio may be a flag for skeptical practitioners to detect smoothing . The data does not support a strong statistical relationship between a high bias ratios and a high Sharpe ratio. High bias ratios exist only in strategies that have traditionally exhibited high Sharpe ratios, but plenty of examples exist of funds in such strategies with high bias ratios and low Sharpe ratios. The prevalence of low bias ratios funds within all strategies further attenuates any relationship between the two. =Serial correlation= Hedge fund investors use serial correlation to detect smoothing in hedge fund returns. Market frictions such as transaction costs and information processing costs that cannot be arbitraged away lead to serial correlation, as well as do stale prices for illiquid assets. Managed prices are a more nefarious cause for serial correlation. Confronted with illiquid, hard to price assets, managers may use some leeway to arrive at the fund‚Äôs NAV. When returns are smoothed by marking securities conservatively in the good months and aggressively in the bad months a manager adds serial correlation as a side effect. The more liquid the fund's securities are, the less leeway the manager has to make up the numbers. The most common measure of serial correlation is the Ljung-Box Q-Statistic. The p-values of the Q-statistic establish the significance of the serial correlation. The bias ratios compared to the serial correlation metric gives different results. Table 3 Serial correlations appear in many cases that are likely not the result of willful manipulation but rather the result of stale prices and illiquid assets. Both Sun Asia and Plank are emerging market hedge funds for which the author has full transparency and whose NAVs are based on objective prices. However, both funds show significant serial correlation. The presence of serial correlation in several market indices such as the JASDAQ and the SENSEX argues further that serial correlation might be too blunt a tool for uncovering manipulation. However the two admitted frauds, namely Bayou, an Equity fund and Safe Harbor, an MBS fund (Table IV shows the critical bias ratios values for these strategies) are uniquely flagged by the bias ratio in this sample set with none of the problems of false positives suffered by the serial correlation metric. The bias ratio's unremarkable values for market indices, adds further credence to its effectiveness in detecting fraud. Practical thresholds Figure 2 Hedge fund strategy indices cannot generate benchmark bias ratios because aggregated monthly returns mask individual manager behavior. All else being equal, managers face the difficult pricing options outlined in the introductory remarks in non-synchronous periods, and their choices should average out in aggregate. However, bias ratios can be calculated at the manager level and then aggregated to create useful benchmarks. Table 4 Strategies that employ illiquid assets can have bias ratios with an order of magnitude significantly higher than the bias ratios of indices representing the underlying asset class. For example, most equity indices have bias ratios falling between 1.0 and 1.5. A sample of equity hedge funds may have bias ratios ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 with an average of 1.29 and standard deviation of 0.5. On the other hand, the Lehman Aggregate MBS Index had a bias ratio of 2.16, while MBS hedge funds may have bias ratios from a respectable 1.7 to an astounding 31.0, with an average of 7.7 and standard deviation of 7.5. Uses and limitations Ideally, a Hedge Fund investor would examine the price of each individual underlying asset that comprises a manager's portfolio. With limited transparency, this ideal falls short in practice, furthermore, even with full transparency, time constraints prohibit the plausibility of this ideal, rendering the bias ratio more efficient to highlight problems. The bias ratio can be used to differentiate among a universe of funds within a strategy. If a fund has a bias ratio above the median level for the strategy, perhaps a closer look at the execution of its pricing policy is warranted; whereas, well below the median might warrant only a cursory inspection. The bias ratio is also useful to detect illiquid assets forensically. The table above offers some useful benchmarks. If a database search for Long/Short Equity managers reveals a fund with a reasonable history and a bias ratio greater than 2.5, detailed diligence will no doubt reveal some fixed income or highly illiquid equity investments in the portfolio. The bias ratio gives a strong indication of the presence of a) illiquid assets in a portfolio combined with b) a subjective pricing policy. Most of the valuation-related hedge fund debacles have exhibited high bias ratios. However, the converse is not always true. Often managers have legitimate reasons for subjective pricing, including restricted securities, private investments in public equities, and deeply distressed securities. Therefore, it would be unwise to use the bias ratio as a stand-alone due diligence tool. In many cases, the author has found that the subjective policies causing high bias ratios also lead to \\"conservative\\" pricing that would receive higher grades on a \\"prudent man\\" test than would an un-biased policy. Nevertheless, the coincidence of historical blow-ups with high bias ratios encourages the diligent investor to use the tool as a warning flag to investigate the implementation of a manager's pricing policies.

In the era of the Pyu city-states it was a city of considerable significance, possibly a local capital replacing Sri Ksetra. Today the modest village is noted for its hot springs and archaeological sites. Hanlin, Beikthano, and Sri Ksetra, the ancient cities of the Pyu Kingdom were built on the irrigated fields of the dry zone of the Ayeyawady River basin. They were inscribed by UNESCO on its List of World Heritage Sites in Southeast Asia in May 2014 for their archaeological heritage traced back more than 1,000 years to between 200 BC and 900 AD. Geography The archaeological sites of Hanlin, (also known as Halingyi, Halin, and Halim), are located above the village in the Watlet Township, Shwebo District, Sagaing Division. It has a population of about 6,400 (2014). It is to the southeast of Shwebo where 33 archaeological mound excavations have been carried out. One road goes for from the bus terminal to Bo Te village and then along a rough road which is under improvement. The other route is to the south of the bus station for along a bad, rocky road that leads to archaeological site 29 and the village. The village is slightly above the surrounding flat land. The land is generally barren except for some irrigated areas. Following the inscription of the site on the List of World Heritage Sites, approach road conditions for a distance of from Shwebo to Halin are now under improvement with funding provided by Italy. History Hanlin's history is linked to the history of the Pyu people who lived between the 2nd century BC to the 9th century AD in the kingdoms that existed at Binnaka, Mongamo, Sri Kshetra, and Halingyi. They spoke the Tibeto-Burman languages. Trade was conducted with China and India. The Pyu's authority extended to eighteen kingdoms, most of them in the southern region of Myanmar. They were refined in their behavior, dress habits, culture, art, and were Buddhists of the Sarvastivada school. The architectural styles which evolved from the 11th to 14th centuries are evident in the Pagan area. Initially their capital city was Sri Kshetra, at the northern edge of the Irrawaddy River delta. In the 7th century they moved their capital to Halingyi which is in a dry zone. For trade purposes with foreign countries they still operated from Sri Kshetra. Their southern neighbours were the Mon people who were followers of Theravada Buddhism. Archaeological findings indicate that habitation existed in this area since the Bronze Age, and that Hanlin was established by the Pyu people only during the 1st or 2nd century BC. Archaeologists have opined that Hanlin was the largest Pyu city until the 9th century AD. Subsequently, Sri Ksetra near Pyay became a more prominent city. However, over the years Pae culture was overshadowed by the Bagan culture. =Legends= There are many legends to explain the sudden disappearance of the Pyu kingdoms. In one legend it is said that a hot sand storm destroyed most of Hanlin. This occurred because the king had murdered his brother with a dagger when he could not create a shower of diamonds to fall on a Chinese diplomat. His son had escaped the disaster that befell Hanlin only to return later as a Buddhist to establish the city and build the Shwegugyi Pagoda.This pagoda is now encircled by agricultural fields with many ancient stupas built of bricks, while Hanlin lies to the north and Halingyi to the south. In another legend it is said that the misdeeds of a prince of Hanlin caused \\"a rain of ash and molten matter [to] pour down heavily and bury[ing] the city completely\\". Archaeological finds Silver coins found at Hanlin A Pyu inscription in Hanlin Archaeological excavations have been carried out by the Department of Archaeological National Museum and Library during 1904‚Äì05, 1929‚Äì30, 1962 to 1967, and from 1963 to 2012. Thirty three mounds have been excavated so far in Hanlin City, in the southern and northern areas of Shwegugyi Pagoda, and in the old Halin town. These have unearthed structures of palace fortresses, cremation grounds, manufacturing sites, brick monuments of Buddhist stupas, walls in different sizes, and water management structures. Also unearthed were eleven human skeletons in fossilized condition. Archaeological excavations at Hanlin village have also unearthed a city enclosed within walls which have twelve gates and show the tell tale marks of a moat. This city is in a rectangular shape and has an area of . It is situated on an undulating terrain of volcanic material at a distance of about from the Ayeyarwady River and from the Mu River to its western side. In the explored area, hot water springs have been found which are stated to have curative properties. A particular find of interest is at excavation site designated HL-22 where three sets of standing stone slabs dating to the 2nd AD are indicative of the megalithic culture. The Southern Gateway has been dated to about 200 AD. At a museum near the archaeological site of Shwegugyi there are exhibits which show archaeological finds from excavations including: human skeletal remains, along with pottery, jewelry, and bronze rattles laid in graves in a series of rows, found below ground. Carbon dating of some of the earliest grave finds indicate that they are almost 5,000 years old. The museum also has exhibits of finds of: silver coins, gold ornaments, bricks with inscriptions of texts, and many antiquities recovered from the Hanlin sites. The Pyu alphabet with links to Sanskrit and the present day Bamar language, inscribed on a tomb stone, is also on display. UNESCO inscription In October 1996, Hanlin, Beikthano, and Sri Kestra were proposed to be inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. This proposal was approved by UNESCO in the 38th session of the World Heritage Committee held in May 2014 in Doha, Qatar. According to the UNESCO report, the Pyu Kingdom prospered for over 1,000 years between 200 BC and 900 AD. All three sites are inscribed under Criterion (ii), (iii), and (iv) covering an area of with a buffer zone of . The integrity assessment by UNESCO of the three sites is: \\"The completeness and reliability of dated archaeological sequences from the site, with the radiocarbon dates derived from intact architectural features dating back to 190 BCE, provide scientific proof of the entire one-thousand year period of occupation of the cities, and reinforces palaeographic dates provided by inscriptions in Pyu script on artifacts excavated at the site\\"  Gallery  File:Graveyard at Hanlin, Pyu ancient city.jpgAn excavated graveyard File:Graveyard at Hanlin, Pyu ancient city (2).jpgAn excavated graveyard at Hanlin File:HanLin.jpgPagodas in Hanlin See also Halin Taungbo References Bibliography * Pyu city-states Tourist attractions in Myanmar World Heritage Sites in Myanmar ","title":"Hanlin, Burma"},{"id":"21200953","text":"The Borna disease viruses 1 and 2 (BoDV-1 and BoDV-2) are members of the species Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus and cause Borna disease in mammals.  Virology  = Genome = BoDV-1/2 have the smallest genome (8.9 kilobases) of any Mononegavirales member and are unique within that order in their ability to replicate within the host cell nucleus. BoDV-1 was isolated from a diseased horse in the 1970s, but the virus particles were difficult to characterise. Nonetheless, the virus' genome has been characterised. It is a linear negative-sense single stranded RNA virus in the order Mononegavirales. Several of the proteins encoded by the BoDV-1 genome have been characterised. The G glycoprotein is important for viral entry into the host cell. It has been suggested that the p10, or X, protein plays a role in viral RNA synthesis or ribonucleoprotein transport. The P40 nucleoprotein from BoDV-1 is multi- helical in structure and can be divided into two subdomains, each of which has an alpha-bundle topology. The nucleoprotein assembles into a planar homotetramer, with the RNA genome either wrapping around the outside of the tetramer or possibly fitting within the charged central channel of the tetramer . P24 (phosphoprotein 24) is an essential component of the RNA polymerase transcription and replication complex. P24 is encoded by open reading frame II (ORF-II) and undergoes high rates of mutation in humans. It [binds amphoterin-HMGB1, a multifunctional protein, directly and may cause deleterious effects in cellular functions by interference with HMGB1. Horse and human P24 have no species-specific amino acid residues, suggesting that the two viruses are related. Numerous interactions of the immune system with the central nervous system have been described. Mood and psychotic disorders, such as severe depression and schizophrenia, are both heterogeneous disorders regarding clinical symptomatology, the acuity of symptoms, the clinical course and the treatment response. BoDV-1 p24 RNA has been detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of psychiatric patients with such conditions. Some studies find a significant difference in the prevalence of BDV p24 RNA in patients with mood disorders and schizophrenia, whilst others find no difference between patients and control groups. Consequently, debate about the role of BDV in psychiatric diseases remains alive. = Replication = Bornaviruses enter host cells by endocytosis. The viral genome and associated viral proteins is released into the cytoplasm following fusion of the viral envelope and the endosome membrane.Schwemmle, M. and Lipkin, W.I. (2004) Models and mechanisms of Bornavirus pathogenesis. Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms 1(2):211‚Äì216 Replication of bornaviruses occurs inside the nucleus. These are the only animal viruses within the order Mononegavirales to do this. Many plant rhabdoviruses replicate in the nucleus. Bornaviruses have negative sense RNA genomes The negative sense RNA is copied to make a positive sense RNA template. This template is then used to synthesise many copies of the negative sense RNA genome. This is like making copies of a mold, and then using these molds to make many more viruses. Endogenous provirus Endogenous viral elements homologous to the nucleoprotein gene of BoDV-1 have been shown to exist in the genomes of several mammalian species, including humans and non-human primates. Evolution A Bayesian analysis of Borna disease virus 1 suggests that the current strains diversified ~300 years ago and that avian-host bornaviruses evolved considerably earlier than this. The ancestral virus seems likely to have been a high AT content virus.

Accessed April 1, 2020. School history =Beginnings= Since the days of the Revolution, a one-room stone schoolhouse had stood on a grassy area known as the Common, located close to the present intersection of South Orange Avenue and Academy Street in Maplewood. In 1814, this building blocked the construction of a new toll highway from Newark to Morristown. The 73 \\"Proprietors and Associates\\" of the school met on August 3 of that year and resolved to erect a new school building near the site of the old one, naming seven Trustees to thereafter oversee the education of local children. The resolution reflected \\"the desire of the meeting that the said school should in the future have the name of Columbian School of South Orange.\\"Foster, Henry W. \\"The evolution of the school district of South Orange and Maplewood, New Jersey, 1814‚Äì1927 The new schoolhouse was a two-story wood structure, topped by a thin steeple and a lofty weather vane. It was completed before the fall term of 1815. The Trustees decided \\"That the price of tuition in this school be fixed at $1.75 per quarter for spelling, reading and writing; for Arithmetic in addition to the above branches the sum of $0.25 cts and for Grammar or Geography the further sum of twenty-five cents.\\" The cost of firewood was to be \\"divided equally among the scholars.\\" On May 10, 1816, the Trustees adopted a seal for the school in the form of \\"a spread eagle standing on a globe with the word Excelsior underneath in Roman Capitals.\\" In the early years, students at the Columbia School were not separated according to grade. All were subject to the same rules, among them the following adopted by the Trustees on May 2, 1827: \\"Every scholar must be made to name every silent letter in his spelling when he spells a word with one in and mention every figure which is placed over a letter and be taught to know their uses and for every mistake or omission in such letter or figure shall be considered the same as spelling a word wrong and subject to the same usage. \\"Every scholar that spells a word wrong or omits a silent letter or figure shall step in the rear of the class and there stand until the class shall have spelled through, then those that have spelled right are to move up in a solid body and those who are in the rear to move down and take their places at the foot.\\" For decades, the school was supported by tuition payments. But gradually the State began to assume a share of the financial responsibility. In 1820, a law authorized townships to levy a tax to pay the tuition of poor students. By 1828, townships had the power to tax for general school purposes. The State itself began to contribute money in 1830, and in 1846 every township was required to raise as much money each year for schools as the State itself contributed. The last tuition assessment for residents occurred in 1861, and thereafter the Columbia School was entirely supported by public taxation. =Post-Civil War= After the Civil War, improvements on the railroad contributed to a decided growth of population in the old Township of South Orange. The general character of the citizenry underwent a significant change and residents known as \\"commuters\\" began to emerge in numbers. In 1867, a state law required that Columbia become a graded school. By 1877, the old two- story wooden building erected in 1815 was found to be woefully inadequate for the growing community. One resident complained that \\"in very cold weather, with stoves at red heat, it is impossible to raise the temperature in the room above 55 degrees, and in such a place are sown the seeds of suffering, disease and death.\\" The Trustees responded in 1879 by resolving to erect a new brick building, of two stories, to accommodate between 220 and 240 pupils. The new structure was opened in 1880. The final cost of construction was $17,094.49. The building later became the northeast wing of the old South Orange Junior High School, demolished when the present middle school was built. The separate existence of the high school began in 1885, when the Trustees decided \\"that in order to increase the efficiency of the Columbia School a new class of a higher grade shall be formed at the commencement of the coming term to be taught by the Principal.\\" Lower grades continued to be housed at Columbia. The Trustees' minutes of May 31, 1888, reflect the principal's request \\"that a diploma be voted to Miss Etta A. Kilburn\\" and that, \\"on motion, a diploma was voted to Miss Kilburn, the first graduate of the high school. =20th century= In 1894, the South Orange, Maplewood, and Hilton school districts were consolidated and became the South Orange and Maplewood School District, with borders essentially identical to those which presently exist. The district remained unified even after Maplewood and South Orange became separately incorporated as municipalities, although there was considerable pressure to split as early as 1904. The close of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th brought significant changes in high school curriculum and school management. The Board of Education had by now replaced the old Board of Trustees. In 1890, \\"manual training\\" was offered in school. By 1891, sciences had been added to the course of study. A tradition of excellence was beginning to evolve, and in 1892 two Columbia graduates were admitted to Cornell University. Musical enrichment was added in 1894 with the hiring of a singing teacher from New York City. Early in the 1900s the value of athletics was recognized and encouraged at Columbia by the organization of boys' and girls' teams. The student council was formed in 1912, and The Columbian student newspaper followed in 1915. There was a reaction to these changes. Complaints arose over so-called \\"fads and frills\\"-inessentials said to be leading to the neglect of reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic. New York papers read by local commuters campaigned for a return to the efficiency of the \\"little old red schoolhouse.\\" But the changes were here to stay. At the same time, pupil behavior was becoming less inhibited, much to the distress of the adult population. Henry W. Foster, superintendent of the district from 1900 to 1927, described the conditions in 1913: \\"Long before prohibition was adopted, venturesome boys were surreptitiously now and then bringing liquor to dances to add to the excitement. There was a decided reversion to animalistic excitement. Musical rhythm from the wilds of barbarism stirred the pulse. The dance abandoned the restraint and refinement of waltz and polka; Bunny Hug, Turkey Trot, Fox Trot, and Shimmey began to reign.\\" The Board of Education reacted by banning all but \\"polite dances\\" on school premises. However, the proscribed behavior persisted, and the Board then stopped all school dances. That continued until it became apparent that students were going to outside dances anyway and the efforts at control were abandoned. World War I Many students and teachers were enlisted during World War I, which had a significant effect on life at Columbia. Pupils in assembly regularly delivered patriotic \\"four-minute speeches.\\" Every room in the school had a full complement of war posters. Epidemics raged during the same period of time. Polio spread around the country in 1916 and, at Columbia, resulted in the deaths of one teacher and several children. In 1918, the global influenza epidemic closed all of the schools in the district for three weeks and one teacher died. In the early part of the 20th century most of the remaining farms in Maplewood and South Orange were sold and subdivided, leading to the present suburban character of the two communities. The increase in population placed enormous pressure on the schools. In 1900, the total district school population was 792; by 1927, it had risen to 4,960, an increase of 526%. Post-World War I The Board of Education initially responded by constructing a sizable addition to the old Columbia School in 1910, which building still housed primary school children as well as high school students. Seth Boyden School and the old Fielding School were erected in 1913 and 1914, respectively. By the fall of 1922 Marshall School was completed. First Street School followed the next spring, and Jefferson School opened in January 1924. Later that year the junior high schools were organized, and both the Tuscan and Montrose buildings were finished. More was needed. The old Columbia School could no longer safely accommodate the student population. A magnificent new structure was planned. The design process was unique in that the faculty and all members of the staff participated by submitting sketches, drawn to scale, of the facilities necessary to satisfy their needs. In 1926 construction began on the present Columbia High School building. Work was completed in September 1927, in time for the fall term. So well-designed was this building that two years later its floor plan was described and pictured in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in an article describing ideal American schools. During this period of time Columbia gained increasing fame for its academic excellence. Educators generally considered it to be one of the most outstanding high schools in the United States. Much of that reputation was due to Henry W. Foster, superintendent from 1900 to 1927, and John H. Bosshart, principal from 1920 to 1927. Bosshart succeeded Foster as superintendent, and later served as the first head of the New Jersey Department of Education. American public schools were all significantly impacted by World War II. In the words of Lt. General Brehon Sommervell, then Commanding General, Services of Supply: \\"The job of the schools in this total war is to educate the nation's manpower for war and for the peace that follows.\\" Columbia High School met the challenge, primarily with curriculum changes designed to prepare boys for service in the military. The science department developed courses in aeronautics. In biology, students studied the effect of flying on the human body. A new modern history course emphasized the \\"historical background for an understanding of the forces which have caused this global war, of the necessity of destroying that for which our enemies stand and of the magnitude of the international problems which face the world.\\" Even the music department offered a new program \\"to train pupils in the informal singing that grows out of wartime needs.\\" Columbia had its own Victory Corps with the objective of encouraging pupils \\"to take some active part in their own community's war effort while they are yet in school. For many years following its opening in 1927, the high school physical plant was more than sufficient for the needs of its population. Although four classrooms and a shop were added to the structure in 1939, it was not until 1958 that a large addition (now C Wing) was constructed to accommodate a burgeoning student body. By 1964, the dimensions of a new population explosion were perceived, and a special Board of Education committee was formed to investigate the needs of Columbia High School in the 1970s. As a result of this study, it was calculated that further additions would be required. During the 1970‚Äì71 school year, B and D Wings were added at a total cost of $5,250,000. The total high school population was now approaching 2,400. The same committee which concluded that physical additions were needed also recommended a new organizational plan to prevent students from feeling depersonalized in such a large system. What grew out of this was the House Plan, which, in 1970, divided Columbia into four sub-schools (or \\"houses\\") of approximately 600 students each. The goal was to provide the intimacy of a small school within a large plant, and each of the houses had, for example, its own student council, intramural athletic teams, and newspapers. All of these were in addition to the traditional school-wide activities. Vietnam War Student reaction to the Vietnam War was a nationwide phenomenon, and Columbia provided no exception to the pattern. A Student Peace Group was organized at Columbia in 1968, and over 300 students actively participated. Members wore black armbands on April 26 of that year, and a community rally was held the next day with faculty members present. On March 27, 1969, a group of Columbia students were suspended for distributing leaflets in school opposing the Vietnam War, without the approval of the school's administration.Decision by Commissioner of Education re Jeffery Goodman, et. al. v. Board of Education of South Orange-Maplewood, Essex County, New Jersey State Library.

Invention of Ultimate Frisbee The Vietnam era generally coincided with a time of protest against all things establishment. One manifestation of this was the ascendancy of Ultimate (also known as Ultimate Frisbee), which became popular around the country as an alternative to varsity sports. The game was conceived of by Columbia students in the late 1960s. It is said that the first organized game took place in 1968 between the staff of the school's student newspaper, The Columbian, and the Student Council.Gold, Daniel M. \\"An Accidental Sportsman in Hollywood\\", The New York Times, February 5, 2006. Accessed November 3, 2007. \\"And yet, as documented in a new book, Ultimate: The First Four Decades (ultimatehistory.com), that's exactly what happened when Joel Silver introduced a motion to the council at Columbia High School in Maplewood, N.J., in 1968.\\" An annual CHS Ultimate Alumni game is played in the student parking lot on the night of Thanksgiving. The event has drawn former CHS Ultimate players from as far back as the original 1968 team to return to \\"The Lot\\" to play against the current incarnation of the team. =Columbia High School today= By the late 1970s, student populations around the nation had entered what proved to be a period of extended numerical decline. The Board of Education organized a citizen Educational Task Force, which conducted a District-wide demographic study and ultimately recommended a series of school closings and consolidations. One of the results was the entry of the 9th grade into the high school in 1980. Declining enrollment, as well as cost considerations, led to the discontinuance of the House Plan in 1982. Columbia High School was the first school in the nation to observe Earth Day, on April 17, 1970. Due to the fact that Columbia was on spring break on April 22, when Earth Day was scheduled for national observance, the presentation was known as Earth Day Minus Five and a specially prepared flag was run up the main flagpole. The all-day observance, which was coordinated by biology teacher Jeffrey Himmelstein, began with Congressman Joseph Minish as the keynote speaker; several noted scientists from the area conducted seminars. Featured was an assembly with films and slide shows that were created by several students and environmentally themed folk songs were sung.

Campus Columbia High School's clock tower, located at the front entrance on Parker Avenue. While thousands of schools were constructed in the same era with little more than local notice, the opening of the present-day Columbia High School warranted articles in The Architect, Architecture, Architectural Record, American School and University, The Brick Builder, Pencil Points, and The American School Board Journal. Rendered in the Collegiate Gothic style by James O. Betelle of the Newark, New Jersey architectural firm of Guilbert & Betelle, the school served as a standard in design as evidenced by the inclusion of a floor plan in a 1930 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica article, and later design homages such as John Marshall High School (Los Angeles, California). Collegiate Gothic, or Academic Gothic, construction was prevalent among schools and colleges in the 1920s, and was Betelle's preferred building style for both its scholastically historic roots and practical considerations.Architectural Styles as Applied to School Buildings The 1927 main building still garners recognition, including recognition by Architectural Digest on its 2017 list of the \\"Most Beautiful Public High School in Every State in America\\".Waldek, Stefanie. \\"The Most Beautiful Public High School in Every State in America\\", Architectural Digest, September 12, 2017. Accessed September 17, 2017. \\"New Jersey: Columbia High School, Maplewood\\" Prominent original exterior features include carved limestone detail, numerous false chimneys, steeply pitched slate roofs, and a seven-story clock tower. While it is not known for certain that Columbia High School was inspired by any earlier structures, there is a strong resemblance to Laynon Hall at Queen's University of Belfast. At the very top of the clock tower is a copper pyramidal structure. The entire pyramid structure rotates, and one side opens, serving as an observatory. The observatory is equipped with a large refracting telescope made by John Brashear. That telescope is no longer functional, but there is a more modern Celestron C11 reflecting telescope that is used by students. Two levels below are the E. Howard & Co. Style No. 3 clock works. Alongside the clock is an enormous bronze bell by the Meneely Bell Foundry. Inside the school can be found rooms with fireplaces, hallways with beautiful faience wall tiles by John Scott Award recipient Herman Carl Mueller of Trenton, and mosaic inlaid terrazzo floors in the front hall. The front foyer was recently renovated, removing non-period lighting and mid-century acoustic tile. The restoration included doors that more closely replicated the 1926 originals, a new terrazzo floor, and dramatic lighting of the zodiac-inspired plaster ceiling. Recently, dubious student art dating from as far back as the 1970s was painted over, among other improvements. The auditorium includes a three-manual Ernest M. Skinner Organ. Although it is little used and not completely functional, the organ is one of the few unmodified Skinners in existence and has received an Organ Historical Society citation. Regrettably, on either side of the stage the large plaster grills that hide the organ pipes were water damaged. The original auditorium chandeliers have also been removed. A similar story exists with regard to the swimming pool; while the original vaulted Catalan Guastavino tile ceiling remains, the chandeliers are gone, and a giant arched window is blocked by a later addition. CHS has had a major addition every 20 to 30 years. In the 1930s, an industrial arts wing brought students the skills needed during the Great Depression. In the 1950s, a large addition, now known as \\"C-Wing\\", added classrooms to cope with increasing student numbers as well as a massive gymnasium (bringing the total number of gyms to three). In the early 70s, a projected enrollment boom and the need for new science, fine arts, and industrial arts space created the need for \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" wings. A new cafeteria, the largest public school library at the time, space for academic advising, a now-gone small movie theater and A/V room and a TV studio were built. With these additions, the earlier 1927 structure is only visible from the front facade and between later additions. In 2005, much of the space previously used for industrial arts such as wood shop and auto shop was transformed into a theatre performance and general use space. In 2009, renovations were completed on the main entryway, reviving original stone and woodwork, but with a conspicuous misspelling of the school's motto, \\"Excelsior\\", carved as \\"Excelcior\\" into the masonry floor. In each era of construction, the chosen design was seen as controversial. The D-Wing, the most recent and most obvious addition to the School, boasts a dramatic modernist design typical of the late-1960s and early 1970s. The clash between this new (and already out-of- fashion) style and the original architecture of the A-Wing is especially visible from Parker Avenue.

IDEF4, or Integrated DEFinition for Object-Oriented Design, is an object- oriented design modeling language for the design of component-based client/server systems. It has been designed to support smooth transition from the application domain and requirements analysis models to the design and to actual source code generation. It specifies design objects with sufficient detail to enable source code generation.Richard J. Mayer et al. (1995). IDEF4 Object-Oriented Design Method Report Version 2.0. Jan 1995. This method is part of the IDEF family of modeling languages in the field of systems and software engineering.  Overview  IDEF4 method is a graphically oriented methodology for the design of object-oriented software systems. The object- oriented programming paradigm provides the developer with an abstract view of his program as composed of a set of state maintaining objects which define the behavior of the program by the protocol of their interactions. An object consists of a set of local state defining attributes and a set of methods (procedures) that define the behavior of that particular object and its relationship to the other objects that make up the system.Patricia Griffith Friel and Thomas M. Blinn (1989). \\"Automated IDEF3 and IDEF4 Systems Design Specification Document\\". Technical report. NASA Johnson Space Center. The IDEF4 method multi-dimensional approach to object-oriented software system design consists of the following items: * Design layers (system-level, application-level, and low-level design), * Artifact design status (application domain, in transition, software domain), * Design models (static, dynamic, and behavior) and the design rationale component, and * Design features ranging from general to specific enabling deferred decision making.  History  The development of IDEF4 came from the recognition that the modularity, maintainability and code reusability that results from the object- oriented programming paradigm can be realized in traditional data processing applications. The proven ability of the object-oriented programming paradigm to support data level integration in large complex distributed systems is also a major factor in the widespread interest in this technology from the traditional data processing community. IDEF4 was developed as a design tool for software designers who use object-oriented languages such as the Common Lisp Object System, Flavors, Smalltalk, Objective-C, C++ and others. Since effective usage of the object-oriented paradigm requires a different thought process than used with conventional procedural or database languages, standard methodologies such as structure charts, data flow diagrams, and traditional data design models (hierarchical, relational, and network) are not sufficient. IDEF4 seeks to provide the necessary facilities to support the object-oriented design decision making process.  IDEF4 concepts  = Dimensions of IDEF4 Design Objects = Dimensions of IDEF4 Design Objects. IDEF4 uses an object- oriented design method or procedure that is very similar to Rumbaugh‚Äôs Object Method TechniqueJames Rumbaugh (1991). Object-Oriented Modeling and Design. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. and Schlaer/Mellor‚Äôs Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) technique.Sally Shlaer and Stephen J. Mellor (1988) Object-Oriented Systems Analysis: Modeling The Real World in Data. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. However, there are some crucial differences: * IDEF4 is specifically designed to be compatible with other IDEF methods, * IDEF4 allows one to track the status of design artifacts from domain object through transition to design specification, and * IDEF4 includes a design rationale component. These extra dimensions are shown in the figure. The edges of the box show the progression of the design from start to finish elaborating each of these dimensions. = IDEF4 Design Activities = In IDEF4, a design starts with the analysis of requirements and takes as input the domain objects. These domain objects are encoded in their equivalent IDEF4 form and marked as domain objects. As computational objects are developed for these objects, they are marked as ‚Äútransitional‚Äù and finally as ‚Äúcompleted.‚Äù The level of completion of an IDEF4 design is determined by setting measures based on the status, level, and model dimensions of individual artifacts in the design. IDEF4 Design Activities. The system-level design starts once the ‚Äúraw material‚Äù (domain) objects have been collected. This develops the design context, ensures connectivity to legacy systems, and identifies the applications that must be built to satisfy the requirements. Static, dynamic, behavioral, and rationale models are built for the objects at the system level. These specifications become the requirements on the application level ‚Äì the next level of design. The application level design identifies and specifies all of the software components (partitions) needed in the design. Static models, dynamic models, behavioral models, and the rationale component are built for the objects at the application level. These specifications become the requirements on the next level of design ‚Äì the low-level design. Static Models, Dynamic Models, Behavioral Models, and the design rationale component are built for the low-level design objects. Sub-layers may be built within each layer to reduce complexity. IDEF4 is an iterative procedure involving partitioning, classification/specification, assembly, simulation, and re-partitioning activities, see figure. First the design is partitioned into objects, each of which is either classified against existing objects or for which an external specification is developed. The external specification enables the internal specification of the object to be delegated and performed concurrently. After classification/specification, the interfaces between the objects are specified in the assembly activity (i.e., static, dynamic, and behavioral models detailing different aspects of the interaction between objects are developed). While the models are developed, it is important to simulate use scenarios or cases Ivar Jacobson (1994). Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. between objects to uncover design flaws. Based on these flaws the designer can then rearrange the existing models and simulate them until the designer is satisfied. = IDEF4 Object-oriented Concepts = IDEF4‚Äôs defines a set of object oriented concepts: * Domains : IDEF4 projects are implemented in a domain. A domain can be seen as the scope of the system being developed. During system design, the software is transitioned between three domains: the application domain, the design domain, and the implementation domain. * Features, Artifacts, and Objects * Object Instance : Objects can be object instances, object classes, and object partitions. Object instances are the individual things encountered in the application domain. * Classes : Classes are generalizations about objects and are used to manage complexity by taking advantage of similarities in object instances and grouping them under a class or category. * Subclass/Superclass : The term subclass captures the concept of grouping particular instances of a class into an even more specialized class. * Partitions : A partition object contains objects and relations. * Attributes : Attributes are an implementation choice on how to represent an object‚Äôs state. * Object States : Object states represent situations or conditions of an object instance that are meaningful in the design. * Method : A method is an implementation of behavior (i.e., a set of instructions according to which the object performs some operation). * Message and Polymorphism : Objects communicate by sending messages to each other. * Event : An event is a signal generated by a method in an object indicating some condition in the object. * Object Life cycles : In any system, objects exhibit patterns of behavior as they cycle through different states. * Client/Server : An object plays the role of a client relative to a message if it is the sender of that message. * Relationships and Roles : Objects connected together with arcs. These arcs are called relationships and they show associations between objects. * Inheritance : A specific type of relationship used in object-oriented technology is inheritance. * Encapsulation and Information Hiding : Encapsulation and information hiding are two object-oriented concepts that are most easily understood when discussed in terms of interactions between objects. = Object Class Identification = The five types of Object classes in IDEF4. The IDEF4 Method assumes that the domain objects have been identified through Object- Oriented Domain Analysis. Methods such as IDEF1, IDEF5, IDEF3, SA/SD can be used to perform domain analysis.Edward Yourdon, and Larry Constantine (1979). Structured design: Fundamentals of a discipline of computer program and systems design. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. However, IDEF4 practitioners should be aware of how objects are identified, as the design process may reveal deficiencies in the Object-Oriented Analysis. IDEF4 had defined five types of classes: * Physical Objects * Role Objects : The role may be related to other activities that the person engages in (e.g., a patient in a hospital, a stockholder, a client, a trustee, a suspect in a burglary, or a tax payer). * Event Objects : Events or incidents may also be considered objects. The identification of events as objects is highly subjective, and will depend on the domain in which the software is to be used. * Interaction Objects : Interaction objects are the result of interactions or transactions between two or more objects. * Specification and Procedure Objects : Specification objects describe the acceptable characteristics of objects instances. Procedure objects refer to the way other object instances may interact.  IDEF4 Building blocks  Organization of the IDEF4 Building blocks. = IDEF4 Layers = IDEF4 users design in three distinct layers: # system design, # application design, and # low-level design. This three layered organization reduces the complexity of the design. The system design layer ensures connectivity to other systems in the design context. The application layer depicts the interfaces between the components of the system being designed. These components include commercial applications, previously designed and implemented applications, and applications to be designed. The low-level design layer represents the foundation objects of the system. = IDEF4 Artifact Status = IDEF4 distinguishes between IDEF4 artifacts newly created from the application domain, artifacts in transition to design specification, and artifacts that have been specified that can be applied to create the design specification. Any design artifact in IDEF4 can be marked as domain, transition, or complete. This allows practitioners and reviewers to track the progress of the design toward completion. = IDEF4 Design Models = Organization of the IDEF4 model. IDEF4 uses three design models and a design rationale component: * The Static Model (SM) defines time-invariant relations between objects (for example, inheritance). * The Dynamic Model (DM) specifies the communication between objects and the state transitions of objects. * The Behavior Model (BM) defines the relations between the respective behaviors of objects. The design rationale component provides a top-down representation of the system, giving a broad view that encompasses the three design models and documents the rationale for major design evolutions. Each model represents a different cross section of the design. The three design models capture all the information represented in a design project, and the design rationale documents the reasoning behind the design. Each model is supported by a graphical syntax that highlights the design decisions that must be made and their impact on other perspectives of the design. To facilitate use, the graphical syntax is identical among the three models. = Design Features = IDEF4 provides a broad range of design features ‚Äì from generic to specific. This range enables deferred decision making by allowing the designer to first capture design features in general terms and later to refine them. This significantly reduces the burden on designers by allowing them to immediately capture new design concepts with IDEF4 design features, even if these design concepts have not yet been explored in detail.

Warm ocean currents warm the air above it, which warms the coast. Cold ocean currents cool the air above it, which cools the coast. This helps keep the coast at a consistent temperature. *Wind and air masses. Heated ground causes air to rise which results in lower air pressure. As it rises it cools and descends to the ground resulting in high air pressure. This cycle repeats, creating wind. These air masses absorb the climate of the air below it. *Elevation. The higher up you are, the colder and drier it will be. When air rises it expands due to low air pressure which causes it to cool. *Relief. The differences in the elevation inland. As air is forced to rise over a piece of land (e.g., a mountain) the temperature decreases and condensation increases. As it condensates water droplets get bigger and heavier and are forced to fall.

Biography He was born in the municipality of Bizovac in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia as Adolf Klaiƒá. His father, Adolf Klotz, changed the family name to Klaiƒá. After finishing classical gymnasium in Zagreb, and graduating at the Faculty of Philosophy the history of South Slavic languages and literatures, Czech and German, Bratoljub Klaiƒá pursues further specialisation in Poland and Czech Republic. He received his Ph.D. in 1941 with the thesis Bizovaƒçko narjeƒçje ('The dialect of Bizovac'). He was a professor at the gymnasium in Vukovar, Prijedor, Osijek and Zagreb, and at the Vi≈°a pedago≈°ka ≈°kola in Zagreb. From 1950. he is a professor of Croatian language at the Academy for Theater and Film Arts. As a member of the State Committee for Language in NDH, Klaiƒá has, in collaboration with other members, arranged an orthographical handbook Koriensko pisanje ('Root-based writing'; 1942), and with Franjo Cipra also a voluminous Hrvatski pravopis ('Croatian orthography'; 1944, reprint in 1992), both based on the morphological-etymological principles in accordance with the official language policy. He became famous for his Rjeƒçnik stranih rijeƒçi ('The dictionary of foreign words'), originally published in 1951 and printed in several editions, most recently in 2012. He translated from foreign languages (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Virgil etc.). As a versed accentologist, he published papers on Croatian prosody, leaving an orthoepical dictionary in MS. He commented and provided critical editions of various Croatian writers (e.g. in the edition Pet stoljeƒáa hrvatske knji≈æevnosti, 'The five centuries of Croatian literature') and linguistically adapted many theater and film performances. He practised diction with actors for the shows and was a main interpreter for unknown words. He studied Polish-Croatian cultural ties and wrote on them. Beside linguistics, he also studied literary theory (Izmeƒëu jezikoslovlja i nauke o knji≈æevnosti, 'Between linguistics and the literary theory'; 1972). In Croatian studies as well as in Croatian culture in general, Bratoljub Klaiƒá left a permanent written and oral mark as a versed lexicographer and orthographical normativist.

Early life Sh≈çji was born in Akita, Akita Prefecture. His father was an employee of the South Manchuria Railway, and his parents moved to Manchukuo, leaving him behind in Japan to be raised by his grandmother, who introduced him to the violin. He graduated from the Waseda University Department of Commerce, where he majored in Marxist economics. He married shortly before graduation from undergraduate studies, and was employed by the South Manchurian Railways Research Division on completion of his graduated degree in 1923. His main work at the South Manchurian Railways was on unionization; however, his highly leftist viewpoints alienated both his managers and the Imperial Japanese Army, and he found himself sidelined to a position in a library. After seven years in Manchukuo, he returned to Japan, where his brother was running a Chinese restaurant near Waseda University. Music career Sh≈çji made his debut as a recording singer in 1933. He attempted to become a Western classical baritone singer, but finally became a popular singer. His first major hit popular song written about Kunisada Ch≈´ji. The song was released in 1934 and sold 400,000 copies. This song became a model for many lesser known singers in the 1930s and early 1940s about tragic or semi-tragic Japanese anti-heroes. .Ewbank, Alison J. and Papageorgiou, Fouli T.

After World War II, many of his songs were banned by the American occupation forces as too nationalistic. In the 1960s, his popularity revived, riding a wave of nostalgia for songs of the early Sh≈çwa period. Sh≈çji appeared four times on the NHK K≈çhaku Uta Gassen, starting with the first broadcast in 1951, followed by 1955, 1956 and 1965.

The locomotives are also classified as Prima DE30BAC They are similar in appearance to the SNCF Class BB 27000, but are in fact the result of a collaboration between Alstom and Siemens. The internal electrical components are similar to those found in the Siemens 'EuroRunner' made for √ñBB; the Rh 2016, and the bodyshell, bogies and other equipment being of the Prima type made by Alstom. The initial order was for 400 machines to be delivered from 2007 onwards with an option for a further 100 additional machines. The order is valued at 1 billion euros. Development =Background= The order for the BB 75000 resulted from a long and arduous project of renewal of diesel freight locomotives, which began in 2000, and spans a period of seven years from the announcement of the tender to the delivery of the new BB 75000s. SNCF had a requirement for new diesel locomotives for two reasons: *The current diesel fleet is very old and expensive in terms of operation and maintenance. *The changes in European pollution and emission regulations as well as noise regulations make it necessary for the organisation to renew its fleet. =Tenders= The first document released by SNCF relating to this order was published in November 2000. It refers to delivery of 124 diesel powered freight locomotives and invites manufacturers to submit tenders. With a delivery date between 2003 and 2006 it set out a requirement for two types of locomotives: *55 Single cab locomotives with an average power of 1200 to 1800 kW (with performances comparable to those of BB 66000 and BB 67000) suitable for medium distance routes. *69 High-power devices with two cabs for long-distance trains. These locomotives would be expected to replace CC 72000 and would need between 2250 and 3200 kW of power. However the project did not receive sufficient funding for the cost of the expensive high powered Co'Co' locomotives that would fulfil the second role and as a result the project was cancelled. A few months after the cancellation of the first tender, a second was launched. It is based on the idea of a single multipurpose engine of medium power (1800 kW) similar to designs already available. These units would be used in multiple when necessary to provide a lower cost alternative to the expense of designing a high powered 6 axle from scratch. New tenders were to be delivered by November 2001 and technical meetings with potential manufacturers held during the spring of 2002. In November 2002, Alstom and Siemens formed a winning consortium (with Alstom taking the lead role) and the project was finalized with SNCF in 2003. The contract was signed on 27 February 2004, and was substantially different from the original specifications published in 2000 not 124 but 400 new machines (all of medium power), which will reduce the average age of the locomotive freight fleet to 15 ‚Äì 20 years. The design used already proven components; traction components similar to those in the Siemens built OBB Rh 2016 and the structural design from the Alstom Prima 427000 series of locomotives. The purchase contract was signed on 25 March 2004 inside the Station of Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, in the presence of the Presidents of the SNCF, Alstom, and Siemens for the purchase of 400 locomotives with a possible further 100. For the occasion, BB 437,002 was disguised to resemble an as yet unbuilt BB 475,001. =Testing and approval= The first locomotives came off the assembly line at Alstom in Belfort in spring 2006. The BB 75001 and 75002 were sent to Test- and Validationcenter Wegberg-Wildenrath in Germany in March 2006 for testing by the manufacturer until May 2007. They then returned to Belfort in early June for a final tests before being delivered to the railway in September or October 2007. BB 75003 and 75004 carried out tests on the national network in June 2006 for the BB 75003. Torque and mechanical tests in took place in Vitry-sur-Seine, then journeying to the French Riviera in July 2006 to test dynamic behavior, noise and vibration. In late October 2006 the exact configurations for the main build of locomotives was issued. BB 75004 went to Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne for tests on the brakes, and haulage tests, before travelling to Nevers for tests on the brakes. The process concluded on 21 November 2006 with BB 75006 undertaking shunting tests at Plouaret. In February 2007 the order allowing entry into commercial operation was given by the √âtablissement public de s√©curit√© ferroviaire (EPSF) and issued to Fret SNCF on the 27th of March. Service Following the test and approval process the production of the locomotives could begin; by the end of June 2007 thirty locomotives had been built. All new BB 75000 are received at the Gare de Longueau on the TER Picardie line in Amiens - where they will help replace the SNCF Class BB 67400 working between northern France and Belgium; from there they will be divided between two depots: *Longueau: 150 - 200 machines (including those with equipment for cross border operations) *Avignon. They are primarily used on journeys of less than 400 km with train weight up to 1800 tonnes, above this mass multiple traction is employed. Their first placements are in the north of France plus the √éle-de-France from June 11 (Massy, Le Bourget, Vaires-sur- Marne and Troyes). Workings in the East and South-East of France will be served by the later production models, while the West will be supported by the new type of BB 60000 and the BB 69000 (which are remotorised BB 66000s). On 28 March 2007, the first commercial multiple working took place consisting of BB 75009 and 75006. Conclusion The introduction of this new locomotive should mean the elimination of BB 67,300, CC 72000, and through multiple unit workings of non-updated BB 66000. It is not impossible that a variant be built or modified for passenger traffic (like the BB 27300 Transilien, derived from the BB 27000) because they have the necessary equipment Updates European standards will become increasingly demanding in terms of the requirements for particulate emissions and also the amount of CO2 emitted. These new guidelines will be implemented in two stages, taking place in January 2009 and in January 2012. To comply with the first set of standards (January 2009) all new locomotives of this type will be built with a new diesel engine: the MTU 4000 R43. As well as engine modifications, the locomotive's exhaust will be changed (many locomotive manufacturers are implementing new exhaust systems to reduce emitted particulates). This will change the external appearance of these locomotives. All new locomotives built thus will be numbered from 200 onwards, i.e., BB 475200 and upwards in number.

The MOI was affiliated to the Profintern. The MOI was initially named Main d'≈ìuvre √©trang√®re, but the French Communist Party, who in practice were in charge, changed the name from √©trang√®re (foreign) to immigr√©e (immigrant) due to perceived xenophobia during the 1930s. During the Second World War, Louis Grojnowski (called \\"Brunot\\") and Simon Cukier aka Alfred Grant took charge, and the organisation gave rise to an armed squad, the FTP- MOI, directed by Joseph Epstein. After the mass arrest of more than 13,000 Jews in the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in July 1942, the groups became somewhat more active. Pursued relentlessly by the Special Brigades of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux, almost all the MOI fighters had been identified by the end of summer 1943. In the autumn the French police arrested them all, and nothing remained of the FTP-MOI. The most famous of the FTP-MOI's members was Missak Manouchian, and the FTP-MOI is widely known from the Affiche rouge, a German propaganda poster displaying the members of the FTP-MOI after their arrest at the end of 1943, whose aim was to stigmatise the presence of foreigners and Jews among the French Resistance; a poem by Louis Aragon, set to music and sung by L√©o Ferr√©, deals with this story. In Belgium too there was a Main-d'≈ìuvre immigr√©e organization, which took part in the Belgian Resistance in the ranks of the Front de l'Ind√©pendance under the leadership of the Bulgarian Todor Angelov and the Italian-Belgian Jacques Grippa, while others were also active in Solidarit√© juive or in the Comit√© de D√©fense des Juifs, led by Hertz Jospa and Have Groisman.

Australian sheep shearers, represented by the Australian Workers' Union, opposed the alteration of the Federal Pastoral Industry Award to allow the use of shearing equipment that used combs wider than 2.5 inches.O'Malley, Rory (May 2006) \\"The Eclipse of Mateship: The 'Wide Comb Dispute' 1979-85\\" Labour History, 90,pp. 155-176. Business and farming groups, such as the National Farmers Federation, supported the alteration of the award as they believed that the wider combs increased productivity.Houlihan, Paul. \\"In Search of the Magic Pudding: A Brief History of the Wide Comb Dispute in the Pastoral Industry Award\\", H. R. Nicholls Society. Retrieved 6 November 2011. The dispute culminated in a 10-week national strike by shearers in 1983 and was resolved by the decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to allow the use of the wide comb shears. The defeat of the AWU in the wide comb dispute has been widely cited as the cause of a decline in union membership and militancy amongst Australian shearers.Limb, Julia. \\"Shearing past celebrated in Hall of Fame\\", Landline, ABC, 10 February 2002. Retrieved 6 November 2011. The historical background is covered in some detail in a book about industrial relations in Australian shearing through the twentieth century.O'Malley, Rory (2013) Mateship and Moneymaking, Australian Shearing: the clash of union solidarity with the spirit of enterprise, 1895-1995, Xlibris, ,pp. 19-26, 40-54, 311-340 The core problem had less to do with the traditional \\"class war\\" between shearers and the graziers, but arose from a longstanding cultural rift amongst shearers themselves. Union opposition to wide combs and the use of New Zealand shearers is also dramatised in Dennis McIntosh's 2008 novel Beaten by a blow: a shearer's story. Moneymaking \\"gun\\" shearers were only too happy to use wide combs, which had been introduced by New Zealand shearers in Western Australia from the late-1960s. On the other hand, the AWU feared it would lead to the erosion of terms and conditions that had been built into the Pastoral Award over many decades, and diehard unionists resented the cavalier attitude of the moneymakers to these regulations. At heart it was about AWU control over woolsheds at shearing time. The restriction on wide combs was a union rule dating from 1910, and it had formally been incorporated into the Award in 1926. The rule had been around for so long that few people had a very clear idea about how it had come about or why it was regarded as so sacred by the unionists.O'Malley (2013), Ch. 3, \\"History of the Wide Comb Ban\\" Not long after the dispute ended, in 1987, one independent observer suggested that it was \\"an argument about values\\" and \\"not about the facts\\". AWU officials described wide combs as \\"immoral and repulsive\\".Quoted in O'Malley (2013), p. 25.

Calgary air traffic control was in major error in its calculation of the flight's arrival time at Cranbrook, and the flight crew did not report while passing a beacon on final approach.\\"ATC transcript Pacific Western Flight 314 ‚Äì 11 Feb 1978\\" Aviation Safety NetworkFebruary 11, 1978 : Cranbrook, BC, Canada : Pacific Western Airlines, Flight 314 : Boeing B-737-275 (sic) : C-FPWC Plane Crash Info Accident Flight 314 departed Calgary at 12:32 on an estimated 23-minute flight to Cranbrook. This estimate was passed to Cranbrook by Calgary Air Traffic Control. Cranbrook was not a controlled airport, and while it had an \\"aeroradio\\" station to provide weather and advisory information to aircraft, it had no control tower or air traffic controllers. As Flight 314 neared the Cranbrook airport, it was snowing with a visibility of 3/4-mile, and a snow removal vehicle was clearing the runway. The Cranbrook aeroradio operator advised the snowplow of the estimated arrival of Flight 314 at 13:05. Flight 314 was expected to report on the approach when passing the \\"Skookum Beacon\\", which would give about seven minutes notice of arrival at Cranbrook. At 12:45 Flight 314 contacted Cranbrook Aeroradio and was passed the latest weather and runway information. At 12:47 Cranbrook Aeroradio advised Flight 314 that snow removal was in progress. After acknowledging the message about snow clearance in progress, Flight 314 made no further calls, and touched down on the runway at 12:55 about 800 feet from the threshold. Flight 314 selected reverse thrust, but immediately cancelled it and started a go-around. The aircraft flew down the runway at a height of 50 to 70 feet, flying over the top of the snow removal vehicle. The engine thrust reverser doors deployed, and the pilot decreased flaps from 40¬∞ to 15¬∞. The landing gear remained locked in the down position. Six seconds before impact, the aircraft was 4000 feet from the runway threshold when the left rudder was momentarily applied. The aircraft climbed, then banked steeply to the left from a height of 300 to 400 feet, and crashed to the left of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed by fire and the impact. Investigation The crash investigation was conducted by the Aviation Safety Investigation Division of Transport Canada and audited by the Aircraft Accident Review Board. (from Library and archives Canada cataloguing data) Boeing simulations showed that the aircraft was controllable with one engine at idle reverse and the other at full forward thrust in a gear up, flaps 15¬∞ configuration. With flaps 25 and gear down, it was not possible to maintain level flight. The go-around would have been successful if the left engine thrust reverser doors had not been deployed.

It is the first film directed by Ozu and was also the first of his many collaborations with screenwriter Kogo Noda. It is a lost film. No script, negative or prints survive.  Synopsis  Sakichi, who has just been released after five years in prison, is telling his younger brother Ishimatsu that he intends to turn his back on crime when an acquaintance of theirs, Genshichi, bursts in. Genshichi is in flight from officers of the law, having been disturbed in the course of a burglary. Sakichi and Ishimatsu allow him to hide with them, but Sakichi urges him to give up his life of crime. Genshichi laughs derisively and disappears. Sakichi apprentices himself to a rice-merchant and by his diligence and honesty earns his employer's trust. Ishimatsu steals a valuable hair ornament from Oyae, the daughter of a wealthy merchant. As he flees, pursued by the constable Manabe, he happens to meet Sakichi on the road. Without warning, he presses the ornament into Sakichi's hand and runs off. Manabe sees the ornament in Sakichi's possession and is about to take him into custody when Oyae and her attendant arrive and tell him that Sakichi is not the thief. Manabe lets Sakichi go, but questions him about Ishimatsu. Sakichi denies knowing Ishimatsu's whereabouts. Manabe then reveals Sakichi's criminal past, causing him to be dismissed from his apprenticeship. Despairing, he turns to drink. Ishimatsu finally decides to mend his ways and suggests to Sakichi that they should return together to their native village, but the disillusioned Sakichi says that society will not allow anyone with a criminal record to turn over a new leaf because it will not believe that the conversion is genuine. Some time later, Ishimatsu and Sakichi are pursued by the constables. They separate and Sakichi is aided by Oyae, who conceals him at her father's business premises. The next morning Sakichi hears the sound of money being counted in the next room. In a sleepwalking trance he raids the cash-box. Oyae's father refrains from condemning him as a thief and even gives him more money to enable him to make a new start in life. Sakichi goes home and is packing his belongings with the intention of returning to his native village when Genshichi arrives and demands a share of the money. After a fight, Genshichi runs away. By chance, he meets Ishimatsu and attacks him. The badly injured Ishimatsu makes his way to Sakichi's house, which is then surrounded by a party of constables led by Manabe. Sakichi fights his way out, goes to the house where Genshichi is hiding, kills Genshichi, frees Oyae, whom Genshichi has kidnapped, and returns her safely to her father, his benefactor. Ishimatsu dies, and Sakichi is left pondering in despair the choice between dying himself or turning to crime.

The coastline varies from fjords, river estuaries to mudflats. The eastern and western coasts of the North Sea are jagged, as they were stripped by glaciers during the ice ages. The coastlines along the southernmost part are soft, covered with the remains of deposited glacial sediment, which was left directly by the ice or has been redeposited by the sea. The Norwegian mountains plunge into the sea, giving birth, north of Stavanger, to deep fjords and archipelagos. South of Stavanger, the coast softens, the islands become fewer. The eastern Scottish coast is similar, though less severe than Norway. Starting from Flamborough Head in the north east of England, the cliffs become lower and are composed of less resistant moraine, which erodes more easily, so that the coasts have more rounded contours. In the Netherlands, Belgium and in the east of England (East Anglia) the littoral is low and marshy. The east coast and south-east of the North Sea (Wadden Sea) have coastlines that are mainly sandy and straight owing to longshore currents, particularly along Belgium and Denmark. Northern fjords, skerries, and cliffs Lysefjord in Norway. The northern North Sea coasts bear the impression of the enormous glaciers which covered them during the Ice Ages and created fjords, lakes and valleys along the coastline and landscape. Fjords arose by the action of glaciers, which dragged their way through them from the highlands, cutting and scraping deep trenches in the land. Fjords are particularly common on the coast of Norway. Firths are similar to fjords, but are generally shallower with broader bays in which small islands may be found. The glaciers that formed them influenced the land over a wider area and scraped away larger areas. Firths are to be found mostly on the Scottish and northern English coasts. Individual islands in the firths, or islands and the coast, are often joined up by sandbars or spits made up of sand deposits known as \\"tombolos\\". North Sea cliff Towards the south the firths give way to a cliff coast, which was formed by the moraines of Ice Age glaciers. The horizontal impact of waves on the North Sea coast gives rise to eroded coasts. The cliff landscape is interrupted in southern England by large estuaries with their corresponding fringing marshes, notably the Humber and the Thames. There are skerries in southern Norway formed by similar action to that which created the fjords and firths. The glaciers in these places affected the land to an even greater extent, so that large areas were scraped away. The coastal brim (Strandflaten), which is found especially in southern Norway, is a gently sloping lowland area between the sea and the mountains. It consists of plates of rock platforms, and often extends for kilometres, reaching under the sea, at a depth of only a few metres. Southern shoals and mudflats Seashore at Zandvoort aan Zee The shallow-water coasts of the southern and eastern coast up to Denmark were formed by ice age activity, but their particular shape is determined for the most part by the sea and sediment deposits.Mudflats in Germany The Wadden Sea stretches between Esbjerg, Denmark in the north and Den Helder, Netherlands in the west. This landscape is heavily influenced by the tides and important sections of it have been declared a National Park. The whole of the coastal zone is shallow; the tides flood large areas and uncover them again, constantly depositing sediments. The Southern Bight has been especially changed by land reclamation, as the Dutch have been especially active. The largest project of this type was the diking and reclamation of the IJsselmeer. Tidal forces have formed the Frisian Islands. In the micro tidal area, (a tidal range of up to , such as on the Dutch or Danish coasts, barrier beaches with dunes are formed. In the mesotidal area (a tidal range of between ), barrier islands are formed; in the macrotidal area (above tidal range), intertidal deposits raise the spring tide range . A soft rock coast is formed in the meso-macro tidal areas located in the southern North Sea. These soft rock coastal bedrock plains are interspersed with soft rock (shale and sandstone) cliffs. The small, historically strategic island of Heligoland was not formed by sediment deposition; it is considerably older and is composed of early Triassic sandstone.

Its discovery traces back to 1845, several years before the start of the California Gold Rush. The legend =Points of agreement= The various versions of the legend tend to agree on a few key points:The Lost Blue Bucket Mine: The Lost Blue Bucket Mine, accessdate: April 13, 2017 # Lost Oregon- bound emigrants discovered it in summer 1845, # The deposit is coarse placer gold in a dry stream bed or canyon, # The canyon is bottomed with lava pocked with cavities and potholes. A drawing of a pioneer covered wagon =Versions of the legend= One version states that a wagon train got lost off the Meek Cutoff of the Oregon Trail, near the Malheur River. Three young men (or boys, or a single girl ‚Äî accounts vary) went to fetch water, and while doing so put some shiny rocks into a blue bucket. Older members of the party said it was copper. Someone asked, \\"Was there much of it?\\" One replied, \\"We could have filled one of these blue buckets\\". This was 1845, before the California Gold Rush, and back then many could not recognize gold. A Mrs. Fisher kept one nugget and left the rest behind. The wagons eventually reached what is now The Dalles, Oregon in October, 1845. The single nugget was eventually recognized as gold. Another version holds that when the Stephen Meek Wagon train stopped along the trail in present-day Crook County near Bear Creek, children went to gather water at some distance from the camp. They returned with a blue bucket filled with shiny pebbles. An old-timer in the party stated that the pebbles were made of copper. One of the families, however, kept several of the pebbles as souvenirs. Years later, and after having moved to California, the family came across the pebbles in a dresser drawer. By this time, the California Gold Rush had occurred, and the expertise was available to recognize that the pebbles were in fact gold. However, no-one could remember the precise location in which the pebbles had been found.

Along with Donato Poveda formed the duo Donato y Estefano, releasing three studio albums through 1995‚Äì1999. After the duo disbanded he went on to pursue a solo career with his album C√≥digo Personal: A Media Vida released in 2005. Est√©fano has worked with Ricky Martin, Julio Iglesias, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Shakira, Mal√∫, Alexandre Pires, Enrique Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada, Paulina Rubio, Anah√≠, Noelia, Chayanne, Jerry Rivera and Thal√≠a, among others. Background Est√©fano left his home in Manizales, Colombia for the United States in 1989, arriving as an aspiring songwriter. He signed his first publishing deal in 1992 with Foreign Imported Productions, a Miami-based company owned by Emilio Estefan Jr. His songwriting debut came later that year on Jon Secada's Otro D√≠a M√°s Sin Verte, namely the number one hits \\"Cree en Nuestro Amor\\" and \\"Sentir.\\" A year later he penned songs for Estefan's wife, Gloria, writing the bulk of her Grammy Award winner Mi Tierra, including a pair of number one singles on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart: the title track and \\"Mi Buen Amor\\" Following this remarkable success right out of the gate, Est√©fano teamed with Cuban singer-songwriter Donato P√≥veda for a pair of albums and a couple of hits for Sony Discos, released as Donato & Est√©fano. But the duo broke up soon thereafter, and Est√©fano returned to his hitmaking ways as a songwriter and now as a producer also. First came some work for Chayanne, who hadn't recorded an original album in years and the result was \\"Dejar√≠a Todo\\", Chayanne's first number one single in over six years. Est√©fano continued to write more chart-toppers for him in the years to come. Two other Latin pop artists who greatly benefited from Est√©fano's work around this time were Paulina Rubio with her best selling album ever, Paulina, and Thal√≠a with her number-one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, Thal√≠a. In 2005, by which time he had been awarded BMI's Latin Songwriter of the Year honor (7) seven times and scored 39 Top 40, 22 Top Ten, and seven number one hits, Est√©fano made his solo debut with C√≥digo Personal: A Media Vida, a collection of especially personal songs that he'd written for himself to sing. However, this album was not as successful as his previous work for other artists. For his work on Amar Sin Mentiras by Marc Anthony, the producer won a Grammy Award.

There are estimated to be around 30,000 to 50,000 √Ñynu people, mostly located on the fringe of the Taklamakan Desert.  History  The origins of the √Ñynu people are disputed. Some historians theorize that the ancestors of the √Ñynu were an Iranian-related nomadic people who came from Persia several hundred years ago or more, while others conclude that the Persian vocabulary of the √Ñynu language is a result of Iranian languages being once the major trade languages of the region or Persian traders intermarrying with local women. The √Ñynu at some point converted to Islam in tandem with the Uyghurs. Tension with the Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples of the area resulted in them being pushed out to the less fertile region of the Tarim Basin near the Taklamakan Desert. The √Ñynu joined the rebellion of Yakub Beg around 1864 against Qing rule. In the 1930s, the √Ñynu joined the Kumul rebellion. After the establishment of the Communist state in 1949, certain ethnic groups were given recognition by the state and allowed more cultural freedom. The √Ñynu applied to be recognized as a distinct ethnic group but were rejected and the state chose to count them as Uyghurs instead.  Language  The √Ñynu people's native language is √Ñynu, a Turkic language with a strong influence from Persian. √Ñynu is usually only spoken at home, while Uyghur is spoken in public, by √Ñynu men and women alike.  Culture  = Livelihood = The √Ñynu people engage mostly in agriculture, animal husbandry or work in the construction industry in the cities. A few also fish or hunt. In the past some were peddlers, circumcisers or beggars. = Discrimination = There is a tradition of discrimination against the √Ñynu by their neighbors, who identify the √Ñynu as Abdal, a name which carries a derogatory meaning. Intermarriage with their neighbors the Uyghur people is uncommon. However, the Chinese government counts the √Ñynu people as Uyghur. = Religion = The predominant religion of √Ñynu people is Sunni Islam although a few profess Shia Islam. Pre-Islamic beliefs and rituals are still practiced by the √Ñynu. Tall poles resembling totem poles can be found in most √Ñynu villages. The bear is one animal that the √Ñynu greatly respect and images of it (along with other spirits) are commonly found on the earlier mentioned poles and play an important role in certain ceremonies.

He was the second son of John Jago and was born 18 December 1815 at the barton of Kigilliack, Budock, near Falmouth, Cornwall, once a seat of the bishops of Exeter. Dr. Jago was a voluminous writer on various medical subjects, the most important of which were investigations upon certain physiological and pathological conditions of the eye, which his mathematical and medical knowledge especially fitted him to discuss. He was also interested in the history and progress of Cornish science and antiquities. He was educated at the Falmouth Classical and Mathematical School until about 1833. After a short period of private tuition he entered St. John's College, Cambridge, in Easter term 1835, and graduated BA in the mathematical tripos of 1839 as thirty-second wrangler. He then determined to adopt the medical profession, and studied at various hospitals in London, Paris, and Dublin. On 16 Feb. 1843 he was incorporated at the University of Oxford from Wadham College. He graduated M.B. on 22 June 1843, and the degree of doctor of medicine was conferred upon him by this university on 10 June 1859. He then began to practise in Truro, and in 1856 he was appointed physician to the Royal Cornwall Infirmary, and he was also connected professionally with the Truro dispensary. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 2 June 1870, and he served (1873‚Äì5) as president of the Royal Institution of Cornwall in Truro, a society of which he had been the honorary secretary for many years.

Developed and maintained by the Canadian company Savoir-faire Linux,Free Software Foundation and with the help of a global community of users and contributors, Jami positions itself as a potential free Skype replacement. Jami is free and open-source software released under the GNU General Public License. In November 2016, it became part of the GNU Project.GNU Ring beta 2 release announcement Two account types are currently available, and many of each type can be configured concurrently. Both types offer similar features including messaging, video and audio. The account types are SIP and Ring. A SIP account enables the Jami softphone to connect to a standard SIP server and a Ring account can register (or use an account set up) on the decentralised Jami network which requires no central server. However, by default Jami uses an OpenDHT node maintained by Saviour-faire Linux to join the network when the user connects for the first time, however the application gives users the choice to run this through their own bootstrap server in the advanced settings. By adopting distributed hash table technology (as used, for instance, within the BitTorrent network), Jami creates its own network over which it can distribute directory functions, authentication and encryption across all systems connected to it.Say Hello to Ring (Savoir-faire Linux) Packages are available for all major Linux distributions including Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Separate GNOME and KDE versions are available. Documentation is available on Ring's Tuleap wiki.  History  Jami was initially known as SFLphone, and was one of the few softphones under Linux to support PulseAudio out of the box. The Ubuntu documentation recommended it for enterprise use because of features like conferencing and attended call transfer.Official Ubuntu documentation In 2009, CIO magazine listed SFLphone among the top five open-source VoIP softphones to watch. In November 2016, SFLphone was renamed GNU Ring as it became officially part of the GNU Project.https://www.gnu.org/manual/blurbs.htmlhttps://linuxreviews.org/Jami It retained SIP support while adding a new communication platform that does not require a centralized server to establish communication. On 18 December 2018, Ring was renamed to Jami, a GNU package, also known as GNU Jami within the GNU Project.  Design  Jami is based on a MVC model, with a daemon (the model) and client (the view) communicating. The daemon handles all the processing including communication layer (SIP/IAX), audio capture and playback, and so on. The client is a graphical user interface.

The organization's mission is to provide a forum to exchange ideas, share best practices, and promote the education and importance of a national intelligence agenda. USGIF provides a number of programs and events such as its GEOINT Symposium, USGIF Academy that accredits colleges and university geospatial program, the annual GEOINT Community Week events, and other programs to provide the community with the opportunity to collaborate with senior-level officials across the multiple communities and support the future of the tradecraft.  History  The United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation was created in January 2004 by a group of tradecraft professionals recognizing the need for a forum where they could work together‚Äî‚Äîoutside their own organizational and corporate interests‚Äî‚Äîtoward a mutual goal of improving national and homeland security. The idea for the Foundation started with an event, Geo-Intel 2003, which drew enough interest to solidify the group‚Äôs notion that the tradecraft community needed a forum. This event drew more than 1,000 intelligence professionals. Just months later, USGIF was created, publicly announcing its launch on May 12, 2004.  Organization  = Structure = The United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF) is a Virginia-based nonstock, nonlobbyist, not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation. The Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, giving direction to not only the Foundation itself, but also the Committees consisting of USGIF members. In turn, the Committees give direction for programs including the GEOINT Symposium, Awards Programs, Scholarships, GEOINT Community Week, Tech Days, the Thinkers' Dinner Series, and Chairman‚Äôs Events. = Committees = The USGIF contains five committees. The Strategic Advisory Committee, which oversees four subcommittees, advises the Foundation on strategic direction. The Planning Committee takes charge of Foundation events and programs. The Technical Committee, which oversees three subcommittees, keeps an eye on emerging technical trends to help keep USGIF advised and educated in new technical developments within the trade. The Academic Committee provides academic outreach to universities and colleges as well as promoting the aims of USGIF in government and industry. The Outreach Committee communicates with the public as well as policymakers about the trade and oversees USGIF Awards.  Events  = GEOINT Symposium = Carrying the torch of Geo-Intel 2003 as an official organization, USGIF rebranded the event as GEOINT Symposium. In November 2004, USGIF held the first GEOINT Symposium in New Orleans and attracted more than 1,500 participants. The annual event has since been hosted in San Antonio, Texas (2005 and 2007), Orlando, Florida (2006), and Nashville, Tennessee (2008), with growing attendance annually. The most recent GEOINT Symposium, GEOINT 2011, held in San Antonio saw a record attendance of 4,451 total speakers, attendees and exhibitors. The GEOINT Symposium was described in 2008 by Tim Shorrock as \\"one of the few open windows into the thinking at the highest levels of US intelligence\\", as it \\"has become the nation's showcase for intelligence contractors and agencies alike...\\".Shorrock, 229. In his book Spies for Hire: The Secret World of Intelligence Outsourcing, Shorrock recounts several notable events at GEOINT Symposiums. Among them, in 2004, the Symposium featured the directors of the CIA, the National Security Agency and the NGA speaking at a public session at the same time‚Äîthe only occasion during the presidency of George W. Bush when such a public collective gathering would occur.Shorrock, 229-230.

This event is held each spring in the D.C. metro area to allow members of US Congress and other government employees convenient access to the latest developments and solutions in geospatial technology. Tech Days is produced in cooperation with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which hosts a classified technology component as part of the event. Tech Days culminates with the GEOGala black-tie dinner. = Chairman‚Äôs Event = In addition to the USGIF Speaker Series, USGIF hosts smaller dinner events where USGIF Strategic Partner Members can listen to and speak with leaders in Government, Defense, Intelligence, Academia, and Industry in a more intimate and casual environment. The event, at times, coincides with a classified briefing or other relevant activities. The Chairman‚Äôs Events are open only to Strategic Partner Members, USGIF Board of Directors, and select invited guests.  Supporting education  USGIF supports education through several programs. It is the only body accrediting university programs in geospatial intelligence, under its Geospatial Intelligence Certificate Program. (Press release) The first four universities accredited were University of Missouri, Pennsylvania State University, George Mason University and the University of Texas at Dallas. The program was launched after several years of planning and community outreach to draft an acceptable set of standards. It also provides scholarships to college and university students in geospatial-related fields as well as to high school students intending higher education in geospatial- related fields and hosts the USGIF James and Susan Clapper Education Initiative Fund to fund earth-science material for primary and secondary students.

It comprises 51 councillors, three for each of the 17 electoral wards of Derby. Currently there is no overall control of the council, with the Conservative Party being the biggest party. Carole Mills took over as Chief Executive in August 2018. As a unitary authority, Derby City Council is responsible for all services within its boundary and is therefore distinct from the two-tier system of local government that exists in the surrounding county of Derbyshire. Outside the city, responsibility is shared between Derbyshire County Council and various district or borough councils, such as Derbyshire Dales, High Peak, Erewash and Chesterfield. Political makeup Derby City Council has 51 councillors, with three councillors representing each of the 17 separate wards within the city. It operates a 'by thirds' operation of elections, meaning that one third of the councillors (one per ward) are elected at each local election for a four-year period. This results in there being local elections three years out of every four, with a fourth fallow year. The council is led by a Conservative administration, supported by a confidence and supply agreement with the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party.

Early years The origins of the Pilsudski Institute date back to March 1923, when colleagues and supporters of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski (led by Col. Walery S≈Çawek (Aleksander Dƒôbski, Aleksander Prystor, Wac≈Çaw Sieroszewski, Adam Skwarczy≈Ñski, Michal Sokolnicki, Artur ≈öliwinski, Kazimierz ≈öwitalski, Leon Wasilewski) collaborated on establishing the Institute for Research into the Modern Polish History (Instytut Badan Najnowszej Historii Polskiej). Formally registered with Poland's Ministry of the Interior on May 27, 1923, the institute's purpose (as described in its bylaws) was to collect and preserve historical records and accounts covering the period from the 1863 January Uprising through restoration of Poland's independence in 1918. The institute was tasked with historical research into collected materials, their publication, and cooperation with Polish authorities and interested associations (in Poland and abroad). Funding for the institute was to be provided by membership subscriptions, donations, legacies and private gifts, book sales and paid speeches. Leon Wasilewski was the institute's first chairman. Activities focused on the creation of an archive of historic records and accounts that would be as complete and comprehensive as possible. To this end, on November 15, 1924 Col. Walery S≈Çawek requested all Pi≈Çsudski \\"legionnaires\\" to protect and donate documents, memoirs, prints, appeals, proclamations, photographs, letters and hand-written notes from their time in service. S≈Çawek's appeal made it clear that all records were deemed valuable in demonstrating legionnaires‚Äô individual contributions and the broader challenges posed by opposition from foreign governments and within their own society. The response was swift and widespread, but ultimately hampered by the institute's lack of a home and post-World War I inflation. 1926 to 1936 The autumn of 1926 saw a formal agreement between the Institute and the Polish army's Bureau of Military History (Wojskowe Biuro Historyczne, or WBH), represented by Brig. Gen. Julian Stachiewicz. Under the new agreement, the WBH provided the institute with office space, collected documents for safekeeping and promised the assistance of its archivists. In return, Stachiewicz was named to the institute's board as secretary-general. After his death in 1934, Stachiewicz was succeeded by Dr. Wac≈Çaw Lipi≈Ñski. The period between 1926 and 1936 proved to be one of dynamic growth for the institute; it developed its archive of materials and activities in the fields of publishing and scientific presentation. Under the guidance of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski the Institute published two volumes of his wartime memoirs, entitled Wspomnienia Legionowe; both volumes were edited by Janusz Jƒôdrzejewicz. The publication (in 1927) of the second edition of Pi≈Çsudski's memoir, Rok 1920, was a commercial success; the revenue generated from the sales of the book enabled further (and expanded) publishing. A classification of the archives proceeded after the Institute acquired office space from the WBH in 1926. The institute's index for 1927 includes the following subcollections: * the Belvedere Archives (Archiwum Belwederskie), covering the period 1910‚Äì1918 and featuring papers pertaining to various aspects of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's life and activities; the PPS (Polish Socialist Party); Zwiazek Strzelecki (a pre-1914 paramilitary organization); the Polish National Organization and the Polish Legions * Personal collection of Col. Walery Slawek * Collections of Leon Wasilewski, Micha≈Ç Sokolnicki and Franciszek Studzi≈Ñski * Archives of the Polska Organizacja Wojskowa, or POW (Polish Military Organisation) In 1929 the institute (chaired by Wasilewski) began publication of a quarterly magazine, Niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá (Independence), which later became a bimonthly. Coverage was devoted to recording all efforts and movements leading to Poland's independence, from the failed January 1863 Uprising to the restoration of the Polish state after World War I. Between 1930 and 1933 the Institute issued eight volumes of Pilsudski's writings under the common title Pisma ‚Äì Mowy ‚Äì Rozkazy; the topical Polska Organizacja Wojskowa POW ‚Äì Szkice i wspomnienia; Wojna 1920 roku by Gen. Lucjan ≈ªeligowski and several works by Dr Felicjan Slawoj-Skladkowski (a military surgeon and early participant in Pi≈Çsudski's field campaigns). Reorganization following Pi≈Çsudski‚Äôs death After Marshal Pi≈Çsudski's death in 1935, the Institute decided to concentrate on documenting his life, emphasizing his political and military careers. With support from Marchall Smig≈Çy-Rydz (the new commander- in-chief of the Polish forces) and Gen. Tadeusz Kasprzycki, the Institute relocated to larger, new premises adjoining the army headquarters on Aleje Ujazdowskie in Warsaw. At that time (on 15 November 1935), it was also renamed The J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute for Research in Modern History of Poland. On 17 December 1936, a government decree granted the Institute tax-exempt and educational status, measures of significant benefit in providing added impetus to the institute's mission and activities. Walery S≈Çawek became the new president of the institute's board of directors, with Leon Wasilewski and Artur ≈öliwi≈Ñski vice-presidents. Between 1929 and 1939, several prominent members of the institute (Hipolit ≈öliwinski, Teodor Furgalski, Boguslaw Miedzinski, Roman G√≥recki and Wac≈Çaw Jƒôdrzejewicz) were instrumental in securing crucial historical records and documentation. Over the time the institute's collection grew to 40,000 volumes, prints, appeals, posters, newspapers and magazines, photographs and period memorabilia. In the final years before World War II, the institute also embarked on supplementing its archives by conducting extensive personal interviews with former legionnaires. From 1932 to 1939 the Institute Archives were led by Wanda Kiedrzynska, Waclaw Gasiorowski and Adam Englert. The pressing need to secure historic records over this period and time dedicated to the institute's publishing ventures, however, cut into time dedicated to archival management. As a result, at the dawn of World War II on 1 September 1939 the institute's archives were not fully indexed. Further reading * \\"Instytut Badania Najnowszej Historii Polski, Zarys dzia≈Çalno≈õci.

Reaktion Books, London. P. 265. (Icelandic: B√∫s√°haldabyltingin), occurred in the wake of the Icelandic financial crisis. There had been regular and growing protests since October 2008 against the Icelandic government's handling of the financial crisis. The protests intensified on 20 January 2009 with thousands of people showing up to protest at the parliament (Althing) in Reykjav√≠k. These were at the time the largest protests in Icelandic history. Protesters were calling for the resignation of government officials and for new elections to be held. The protests stopped for the most part with the resignation of the old government led by the right-wing Independence Party. A new left-wing government was formed after elections in late April 2009. It was supportive of the protestors and initiated a reform process that included the judicial prosecution before the Landsd√≥mur of the former Prime Minister Geir Haarde. Several referenda were held to ask the citizens about whether to pay the Icesave debt of their banks. From a complex and unique process, 25 common people, of no political party, were to be elected to form an Icelandic Constitutional Assembly that would write a new Constitution of Iceland. After some legal problems, a Constitutional Council, which included those people, presented a Constitution Draft to the Iceland Parliament on 29 July 2011. Chronology =2008‚Äì2009: Protests and Government change= H√∂r√∞ur Torfason at the second weekly protest, on 18 October 2008 Concerned with the state of the Icelandic economy, H√∂r√∞ur Torfason staged a one-man protest in October 2008. Torfason stood \\"out on Austurv√∂llur with an open microphone and invited people to speak\\". 31 March 2009. The following Saturday a more organised demonstration occurred, and participants established the Raddir f√≥lksins. The group decided to stage a rally every Saturday until the government stepped down. Torfason led the protest from a stage near the front. 31 March 2009. 31 March 2009.

Formal address by Ernesto Ordiss, and √ìskar √Åst√æ√≥rsson, kindergarten teacher. Impromptu speakers were Birgir √û√≥rarinsson, Sturla J√≥nsson, and Kolfinna Baldvinsd√≥ttir. The protests were a feature of the traditional New Year's Eve comedy revue, √Åram√≥taskaupi√∞, in 2008. The sketches included one of J√≥n Gnarr playing a strait-laced middle-aged protester struggling to express his indignation at the crisis and eventually coming up with a sign reading Helv√≠tis fokking fokk!! This phrase soon came to be used in real-life placards and wider discourses surrounding the protests. On 20 January 2009, the protests intensified into riots. Between 1,000 and 2,000 people clashed with riot police, who used pepper spray and batons, around the building of the parliament (Althing), with at least 20 people being arrested and 20 more needing medical attention for exposure to pepper spray. Demonstrators banged pots and honked horns to disrupt the year's first meeting of Prime Minister Geir Haarde and the Althing. Some broke windows of the parliament house, threw skyr and snowballs at the building, and threw smoke bombs into its backyard. The use of pots and pans saw the local press refer to the event as the \\"Kitchenware Revolution\\".Ian Parker, Letter from Reykjav√≠k, \\"Lost,\\" The New Yorker, 9 March 2009, p. 39. On 21 January 2009, the protests continued in Reykjav√≠k, where the Prime Minister's car was pelted with snowballs, eggs and cans by demonstrators demanding his resignation. Government buildings were surrounded by a crowd of at least 3,000 people, pelting them with paint and eggs, and the crowd then moved towards the Althing where one demonstrator climbed the walls and put up a sign that read \\"Treason due to recklessness is still treason.\\" No arrests were reported. On 22 January 2009, police used tear gas to disperse people on Austurv√∂llur (the square in front of the Althing), the first such use since the 1949 anti-NATO protest. Around 2,000 protesters had surrounded the building since the day before and they hurled fireworks, shoes, toilet paper, rocks, and paving stones at the building and its police guard. Reykjav√≠k police chief Stef√°n Eir√≠ksson said that they tried to disperse a \\"hard core\\" of a \\"few hundred\\" with pepper spray before using the tear gas. Stef√°n also commented that the protests were expected to continue, and that this represented a new situation for Iceland. Despite the announcement on 23 January 2009 of early Parliamentary elections (to be held on 25 April 2009) and the announcement of Prime Minister Geir Haarde that he was withdrawing from politics due to esophageal cancer and would not be a candidate in those elections, protesters continued to fill the streets, calling for a new political scene and for immediate elections; Haarde (Independence Party) announced on 26 January 2009 that he would hand in his resignation as PM shortly, after talks with the Social Democratic Alliance on keeping the government intact had failed earlier the same day. The Social Democratic Alliance formed a new government on minority coalition with the Left-Green Movement, with the support of the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party, which was sworn in on 1 February. Former Social Affairs Minister J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir became Prime Minister. The three parties also agree to convene a constitutional assembly to discuss changes to the Constitution. There was no agreement on the question of an early referendum on prospective EU and euro membership. The parliamentary election was held in Iceland on 25 April 2009. following strong pressure from the public as a result of the Icelandic financial crisis. The Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement, which formed the outgoing coalition government under Prime Minister J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, both made gains and an overall majority of seats in the Althing (Iceland's parliament). The Progressive Party also made gains, and the new Citizens' Movement, formed after the January 2009 protests, gained four seats. The big loser was the Independence Party, which had been in power for 18 years until January 2009: it lost a third of its support and nine seats in the Althing. =2009‚Äì2010: Citizen forums and Constitutional changing= Taking its cue from nationwide protests and lobbying efforts by civil organisations, the new governing parties decided that Iceland's citizens should be involved in creating a new constitution and started to debate a bill on 4 November 2009 about that purpose. Parallel to the protests and parliament deliverance, citizens started to unite in grassroots-based think-tanks. A National Forum was organised on 14 November 2009 (Icelandic: √ûj√≥√∞fundur 2009), in the form of an assembly of Icelandic citizens at the Laugardalsh√∂ll in Reykjav√≠k, by a group of grassroots citizen movements such as Anthill. The Forum would settle the ground for the 2011 Constitutional Assembly and was streamed via the Internet to the public. 1,500 people were invited to participate in the assembly; of these, 1,200 were chosen at random from the national registry, while 300 were representatives of companies, institutions and other groups. Participants represented a cross section of Icelandic society, ranging in age from 18 to 88 and spanning all six constituencies of Iceland, with 73, 77, 89, 365 and 621 people attending from the Northwest Constituency, Northeast Constituency, South Constituency, Southwest Constituency and Reykjav√≠k (combined), respectively; 47% of the attendants were women, while 53% were men. On 16 June 2010 the Constitutional Act was accepted by parliament and a new Forum was summoned.http://www.thjodfundur2010.is/other_files/2010/doc/Act-on-a- Constitutional-Assembly.pdf The Constitutional Act prescribed that the participants of the Forum had to be randomly sampled from the National Population Register, \\"with due regard to a reasonable distribution of participants across the country and an equal division between genders, to the extent possible\\".Act on a Constitutional Assembly, Interim Provision The National Forum 2010 was initiated by the government on 6 November 2010 and had 950 random participants, organized in subcommisions, which would present a 700-page document that would be the basis for constitutional changes, which would debate a future Constitutional Assembly. The Forum 2010 came into being due to the efforts of both governing parties and the Anthill group. A seven- headed Constitutional Committee, appointed by the parliament, was charged with the supervision of the forum and the presentation of its results, while the organization and facilitation of the National Forum 2010 was done by the Anthill group that had organized the first Forum 2009. =2010‚Äì2011: Constitutional Assembly and Council= The process continued in the election of 25 people of no political affiliation on 27 November 2010. The Supreme Court of Iceland later invalidated the results of the election on 25 January 2011 following complaints about several faults in how the election was conducted, but the Parliament decided that it was the way, and not the elects, that had been questioned, and also that those 25 elects would be a part of a Constitutional Council and thus the Constitutional change went on. On 29 July 2011 the draft was presented to the Parliament. =2012: Referendum on the new Constitution= After the draft of the Constitution was presented on 29 July 2011, the Al√æingi, the Icelandic parliament, finally agreed in a vote on 24 May 2012, with 35 in favor and 15 against, to organize an advisory referendum on the Constitutional Council‚Äôs proposal for a new constitution no later than 20 October 2012. The only opposing parliament members were the former governing right party, the Independence Party. Also a proposed referendum on discontinuing the accession talks with the European Union by some parliamentaries of the governing left coalition was rejected, with 34 votes against and 25 in favour.

The first Icesave referendum (Icelandic: √ûj√≥√∞aratkv√¶√∞agrei√∞sla um Icesave), was held on 6 March 2010. The referendum was resoundingly defeated, with 93% voting against and less than 2% in favor. After the referendum, new negotiations commenced.

After the referendum failed to pass, the British and Dutch governments said that they would take the case to the European courts. PM trial The Althing (Iceland's parliament) voted 33‚Äì30 to indict the former Prime Minister Geir Haarde, but not the other ministers, on charges of negligence in office at a session on 28 September 2010. He would stand trial before the Landsd√≥mur, a special court to hear cases alleging misconduct in government office: it will be the first time the Landsd√≥mur has convened since it was established in the 1905 Constitution.

London School of Economics professor Robert Wade said that Iceland's government would fall within the coming days and Fredrik Erixon of the Brussels-based European Centre for International Political Economy compared the current situation with the French Revolution of 1789. Eirikur Bergmann, an Icelandic political scientist, wrote in The Guardian that \\"While Barack Obama was being sworn into office on Capitol Hill yesterday, the people of Iceland were starting the first revolution in the history of the republic. The word \\"revolution\\" might sound a bit of an overstatement, but given the calm temperament that usually prevails in Icelandic politics, the unfolding events represent, at the very least, a revolution in political activism.\\" Valur Gunnarsson, also of The Guardian, writes that \\"Iceland's government was last night scrambling to avoid becoming the first administration to be ousted by the global financial crisis.\\" He also writes that \\"The protesters have begun referring to their daily attempt to oust the government as a 'saucepan revolution', because of the noise-inducing pots and pans brought along to the protests.\\" Eva Hei√∞a √ñnnud√≥ttir studied the demography of the protesters to see whether participants in the Austurv√∂llur protests came from groups with greater histories of political participation and greater access to political resources than non-participants, but found that this was not a determining factor: rather, participants were simply more likely to have a direct personal incentive to protest. Writing in the wake of the 2013 Icelandic parliamentary election, which returned to power the parties most closely associated with Iceland's banking boom, G√≠sli P√°lsson and E. Paul Durrenberger concluded that > While the grassroots movement that overthrew the government after the crash > remains disillusioned and disappointed, its impact should not be under- > estimated.

Biography James Alexander Stillman was born on August 18, 1873 in New York City to James Jewett Stillman (1850‚Äì1918) and Sarah Elizabeth Rumrill. His paternal grandfather was Charles Stillman (1810‚Äì1875), the founder of Brownsville, Texas. He graduated Harvard University in 1896. Career In 1918, his father who was chairman of National City Bank of New York died and the younger Stillman engaged in a fight with Frank A. Vanderlip to control the company. Eventually in 1919, Vanderlip quit and Stillman became chairman. His father's estate was estimated at $45,000,000. While he was chairman, he urged temperate speech and urged people not to do or say anything that causes excitement while discussing general conditions of the country. He served as chairman for three years until personal issues relating to a divorce with his wife caused him to resign. In 1921, Stillman sold 5,000 city lots in Brownsville, Texas that were part of his grandfather's estate, with estimates putting their value upwards of $1,500,000. Personal life In 1901, he married Anne \\"Fifi\\" Urquhart Potter at Grace Church in Manhattan. She was the daughter of James Brown Potter. Together they had: *Anne Stillman (1902‚Äì1987), who married Henry P. Davison, Jr. (1898‚Äì1961), son of Henry Pomeroy Davison. *James \\"Bud\\" Alexander Stillman (1904‚Äì1998), a doctor with the U.S. Army Medical Corps *Alexander Stillman (1911‚Äì1984), a Lieutenant with the U.S. Navy and former assistant cashier of National City Bank *Guy Stillman (1918‚Äì1985), also Lieutenant with the U.S. Navy In 1921, he filed for divorce accusing his wife of infidelity and saying that her youngest child was the son of a half-blood Indian guide from Quebec, who was the superintendent of the Stillman's propriety in Grande-Anse. His wife denied the charges and accused him of fathering an illegitimate child with chorus girl Florence H. Leeds. Stillman later acknowledged his son with Leeds in 1926 by agreeing to give $20,000 a year in trust to their son until he was 21. At that point, he was to receive $150,000. The son was: *Jay Ward Leeds After five years, the court refused the divorce saying that he had misbehaved. His wife then filed for divorce but withdrew the contest after receiving a $500,000 necklace. They sailed to Europe to receive counseling from Carl Jung. He eventually acknowledged he was the father of Guy and the court case ended up costing him more than $1 million but they reconciled in 1926. Fifi eventually divorced Stillman in 1931 and married Fowler McCormick, a man twenty years younger than her and a friend of their son, Bud. He died on January 13, 1944, a few days before he planned to visit his winter home in Havana, Cuba. His estate was split between his four children with a bequest going to his friend, Bernard E.

However, all models currently produced have night sights standard. Starting in 2012, many variants have an ambidextrous thumb safety standard or as an option. Variants When introduced in 2009, the P238 was available in a matte black finish and a two- tone finish with a matte silver colored slide and black frame. Since then, SIG Sauer has produced a number of variants including some short run commemorative editions. Among the variants are versions with various finishes, with a stainless steel frame and different grips and embellishments. The SIG Sauer P938, chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum and introduced at the 2011 SHOT Show, is a slightly larger version of the P238. Recall In July 2009, SIG Sauer issued a recall of all P238s sold within a certain serial number range, which they referred to as a \\"Mandatory Safety Upgrade\\". The reason stated for the recall was that a small number of P238s were built with defective manual safety levers, leading to \\"the remote possibility that the gun could fire unintentionally, thus creating a risk of injury or death\\", although SIG Sauer emphasized that no such injuries had actually occurred.

NUHW was formed by Rosselli and former members of UHW-West following the trusteeship. UHW-West's leadership had refused to support the transfer of 65,000 homecare and nursing home workers into a different SEIU local union. The local had also been critical of deals struck by SEIU that prohibited nursing home employees from reporting safety concerns to authorities. After a brief standoff, SEIU International President Andy Stern placed UHW-West in trusteeship, removing its leaders and appointing two senior SEIU staff members to run the local. The ousted leaders, together with other disgruntled members, announced the formation of NUHW just days later.> SEIU filed a federal lawsuit against NUHW and several former SEIU-UHW staff members in 2009, alleging they breached their fiduciary duty for opposing SEIU's efforts to impose a trusteeship and for working to build a rival union while still employed by SEIU. On April 9, 2010, a jury awarded a total of $737,850 in damages to SEIU. In 1969, Rosselli worked with Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker group, and later spent two years in the Peace Corps.

Located in the area of in the Hawkesbury region of Sydney, Australia, the establishment was opened in April 1965 to train officer cadets who had been called up for service under the national service scheme and offered a short but rigorous commissioning course for trainees, tailored to meet the Army's need to increase the number of junior officers being produced in order to meet commitments to train national servicemen, and to provide platoon commanders for units serving overseas in Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia. It was closed in 1974 after the national service scheme was abolished in December 1972 and the last OCS Portsea class finished their time at Scheyville. History On 24 November 1964, the National Service Act was passed by the Australian Federal parliament, allowing the Menzies government to re-establish the national service scheme ‚Äì which had been suspended in 1959 ‚Äì as a response to growing uncertainty in Australia's strategic outlook in Southeast Asia. Unlike previous versions of national or compulsory service, which had limited the liability of men called up to service in Australian territory within the meaning of the Defence Act (1903) only, the new scheme envisaged conscripted soldiers serving in Regular Army units to bolster their numbers for deployment being sent overseas to meet Australia's commitments in Southeast Asia. As such many would take part in the fighting Vietnam and Malaysia. Although largely opposed by the Australian Army hierarchy, the reintroduction of conscription necessitated a requirement for the expansion of the Army's training establishments to meet the increased numbers of men undergoing training. This, coupled with the expansion of the Royal Australian Regiment to nine battalions, meant that there was a need for the Army to increase the numbers of junior officers serving in its ranks in order to oversee the training of national servicemen and to command platoons on operations overseas. To meet this requirement the decision was made to create a new Officer Training Unit (OTU) to deliver this course. At the same time the decision was taken to train pilots for the Army at OTU. Colonel (later Brigadier) Ian Geddes was given the responsibility of bringing this organisation into being, and on 1 April 1965 the OTU was established at Scheyville, New South Wales. Approximately north- west of Sydney, the land had originally been used as part of the Dreadnought agricultural training scheme, before being used during the First World War as an internment camp for \\"enemy aliens\\". Later, during the Second World War the Army had used the site for conducting training exercises before it was converted in 1949 into a camp for migrants. Because there was a requirement to expand the size of the Army quickly, out of necessity the course offered by Scheyville was much shorter than those offered at the other officer training establishments. Whereas officers were produced over the course of eleven months at Officer Cadet School, Portsea and four years at Royal Military College, Duntroon, the OTU course was condensed into 22 weeks. From the outset the course was designed to be physically demanding and mentally challenging, and each lesson was designed to instil a number of teaching points in order to meet the requirements of the syllabus. It was a hectic schedule, and the cadets were required to work up to 14 hours a day, without weekends off in the first month. As a result, many cadets did not pass; indeed the OTU had a failure rate of around 30 per cent. Those who did not pass were removed from the course and completed their national service obligation as an other rank, although many quickly progressed through the ranks to become junior non- commissioned officers. Cadets who did successfully complete the course were commissioned as second lieutenants. The majority were allocated to the infantry, although graduates were posted to all corps of the Army and went on to serve in Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia and Singapore, as well as throughout Australia. The abolition of National Service in December 1972 by the Whitlam government meant that there was no longer a requirement for an accelerated commissioning course and, as such, OTU Scheyville was finally closed in April 1974. Officer training in the Australian Army would continue at RMC Duntroon and OCS Portsea, although Portsea was itself closed in 1985 when RMC Duntroon took on the role of providing the 18-month commissioning course and the Australian Defence Force Academy was established to provide tertiary education. During the course of its operation OTU Scheyville produced 1,871 officers for the ARA or RAS (NS). 10 CMF Officers also graduated at OTU. Of these, the majority were national servicemen, although 68 were members of the Regular Army who attended Scheyville in this time. These Regular Army officers, however, went to OCS Portsea at the end of their Scheyville course to graduate as OCS Portsea officers (1/72, 2/72 and 1/73 OCS (S) courses); in fact, the last cadets at Scheyville were the Regulars who graduated (at OCS Portsea) eight months after the last national service officer cadets graduated. Relations between the national service and Regular cadets were very friendly. The failure rate for these regulars was similar to the national service cadets. A total of 97 OCS (S) cadets commenced the three courses with 68 graduating. During the same period of time, 1,287 officers graduated from Portsea and 465 graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon. =Alumni= Over 360 Scheyville graduates served in Vietnam, eight of whom were killed in action. Gordon Sharp was the first OTU trained officer to be killed in Vietnam while serving with the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment at the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966. It was Sharp's platoon that suffered the majority of fatalities in that battle after he himself was killed at its beginning. Of the 1,699 national service officers produced, around 300 later chose to join the Regular Army, while many continued to serve in the Citizen Military Force (CMF ‚Äì later the Army Reserve) thus ensuring the continuing legacy of the OTU within the Australian Army into the 1980s and well beyond. One Scheyville graduate rose to the rank of major general in the Reserve while 14 reached the rank of brigadier, with a couple still serving as late as 2002, even though during their training they had been told that it was unlikely they would be promoted past major. One graduate, Brigadier Peter Pursey, AM, served for a time as Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. A number of graduates also rose to prominence in civilian life. Some of the most notable examples include Jeff Kennett, who became Premier of Victoria, and Tim Fischer, who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. There were also a number of other parliamentarians, broadcasters, journalists and academics.

Kirby mostly specialized in paddle-wheel and steamship design. Perhaps his most famous vessel, Tashmoo, was a paddle-wheeler launched on New Year's Eve, 1899. She was constructed by the Detroit Shipbuilding Company in Wyandotte, Mich., for the White Star Steamship Co. of Detroit. The 306-foot vessel made her maiden voyage on June 9, 1900. She would become one of the best known - and most beloved - excursion steamers on the Great Lakes. Kirby also is well- renowned for his design of the \\"Bob-Lo boats\\" - the Columbia and the Ste.

The town site is located in the New River Gorge at Kaymoor Bottom (). It is linked to the mine portal above on Sewell Bench () in the wall of the Gorge by conveyors. The mine exploited the New River Coalfield's Sewell Seam of \\"smokeless\\" low- volatile bituminous coal, while the town site was accessible only by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad's mainline in the Gorge. The last portion of the Kay Moor complex, Kaymoor Top () was located at the Gorge rim and served as the terminus for the mountain haulage. History The mine property was purchased in 1873 by Abiel Abbot Low, managing director of the Low Moor Iron Company in Low Moor, Virginia, which was to be the mine's chief client. The property was kept in reserve until 1899, when the Kay Moor mine was opened to supply coal and coke to the company's blast furnaces. In 1925 the mine was sold to the New River and Pocahontas Consolidated Coal Company, a subsidiary of the Berwind-White Corporation of Philadelphia. The town was named for James Kay, a Low Moor Iron Company employee who was in charge of building the town. Fifty houses were built in 1901, followed by 45 in 1902 and 17 in 1905. A suburb, called New Camp, was built in 1918-1919 with another 19-24 houses, and represents the only extant town site remaining. Kay Moor town's public facilities were spartan, with no churches, saloons, banks or town hall, only pairs of segregated schools at top and bottom, company stores, a pool hall and a ball field. By 1952 Kaymoor Bottom had been abandoned, and in 1960 most of its structures were destroyed by fire. The mine was connected to the town by a single-track incline which lifted workers and equipment up a slope at a thirty-degree incline. Coal was moved along a similar double-track incline, which lowered coal to the processing plant and the coke ovens, with the cars or monitors moving in opposite directions and partially counterbalancing each other. Both inclines operated until 1962. Initial operations included 120 coking ovens, which were increased to 202 ovens during World War I. All of the beehive ovens closed in the 1930s, as they had become obsolete. HAER drawing of Kay Moor headhouse The mine itself was a room and pillar mine that was first worked with mule-drawn railcars. Locomotives later supplanted the mules. Kay Moor today The site is now extensively overgrown and obscured by foliage. Structures and machinery have deteriorated due to the corrosive interaction of coal dust and rainwater, while the bench level was salvaged in 1980-81. Despite this, the site retains significant amounts of mining machinery and is considered one of the most complete examples of an integrated coal mine and company town in West Virginia. The entire Kay Moor site is now located within the boundaries of New River Gorge National River. Visiting Kay Moor Kaymoor Top is accessible from Kaymoor No. 1 Road (County Route 9/2). At Kaymoor Top is a trailhead for the Kaymoor Miners Trail, which provides the most direct access to the Kaymoor Mine level (via stairs and switchbacks), and then to Kaymoor Bottom via stairs. The Kaymoor Mine level is also accessible via the long, relatively flat, Kaymoor Trail; a trailhead is located on County Route 82.

It is heritage-listed. Description Glenbrook Lagoon is a heritage listed site located in the suburb of Glenbrook in the Blue mountains 10 kilometres west of Penrith and 3.8 km from Nepean river. The lagoon is a natural flat bottom freshwater lagoon with an average depth of 2.7 metres and a maximum depth of 4.05 metres. The lagoon covers an area of 7 hectares. Flowing directly from Lapstone creek the lagoon is also feed by natural springs. Glenbrook Lagoon is one of only three similar to its kind in the Hawkesbury area water catchment. Over the past centuries the lagoon has had several uses. The lagoon and its surrounding area provide an important natural sanctuary for native flora and fauna. Currently the lagoon is used as a nature reserve and tourist attraction. Glenbrook lagoon is of great cultural and historical significance to the people of the Blue Mountains. History Bordered by residential areas on four sides, Glenbrook Lagoon serves as a reminder of the area's historic bush past. Best known for being found by William Lawson, William Wentworth and Gregory Blaxland on their crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813; Blaxland, In his journal, described the way he \\"fell into a large lagoon of good water of very coarse rushes\\". In 1814 the lagoon and its surrounding areas were used as a camp by a group of convicts lead by Cox as they built the first road over the Blue Mountains. At the instruction of Governor Macquarie the camp was later used as a Military depot at the start of the mountains checking travellers permits to travel over the Blue Mountains. After a depot at Springwood was opened the depot at Glenbrook lagoon was no longer of use, however the lagoon was still used as an essential and welcomed source of water for those who travelled over the mountains by horse. The waterhole was later used to cool the engines of the early trains. The lagoon is now home to several wetland birds. In 2006, the Blue Mountains City Council commenced a lagoon restoration project, removing weed infestations.  Ellis family cottage  The Ellis family lived in the area in the 1940s, running an orchard and garden, in spite of the poor-quality soil. The land was clear at the time, but has now returned to nature after work carried out by the Glenbrook Lagoon Society Bushcare group, Blue Mountains City Council and the Urban Runoff Control Program. The remains of the Ellis family cottage are located a hundred metres north of the lagoon. Uses The lagoon was first used as a military depot. The depot was used to check the permits of travellers who were planning on traveling over the Blue mountains. The lagoon was then used throughout 1867 to 1913 as an essential part of the Zig Zag railway system which took passengers through the Blue mountains. Pipes took lagoon water to Glenbrook railway station providing the railway system with an important source of water. As a result, the left side of the lagoon was dammed in order to make the lagoon bigger and a larger source of water for the railway. The dam wall is currently used a road that allows residents to pass the lagoon. This road is currently known as Glenbrook road but was previously named Railway street. In the 1860s the lagoon was also used as a dam to provide drinking water for the people living in the small town of Glenbrook The lagoon is currently used as a historical tourist attraction and bush walking site. The lagoon and its surrounding area also provide an important natural sanctuary for native flora and fauna which is quite unique in the urbanised township of Glenbrook. Glenbrook lagoon also plays an important role in fighting bushfires. Helicopters use large buckets to collect the lagoon water and dump it over out of control bushfires. The lagoon water has been used in this way for several bush fires in 2001, 2013 and 2017.  Significance of the Lagoon  Due to its rich historical value the lagoon is holds great cultural significance to the local area. The lagoon was also previously used as a place to swim and fish by the local people. Therefore, it holds many fond memories for the people of Glenbrook. Due to the role in which the lagoon has played throughout the history of the Blue mountains especially in regards to its uses with the Zig Zag railway it has been deemed that Glenbrook Lagoon Carries a great historical significance for the people of the Blue mountains. The lagoon also hosts a range of native species of flora and fauna. The lagoons surrounding area features large Euclaypt and Angophora Costa (Eucalyptus piperita) trees, which are unique to the location of the lagoon. These trees provide a suitable habitat for the Peron's Tree Frog (L. peronii). The dense rushes such as Grey rush (Lepironia articulate), Spike rush (Eleocharis sphacelata) as well as fallen logs surrounding the edges of the lagoon, make good foraging habitat for native wetland birds such as the Swamp hen (Genus porphyria). These native plants also provide some protection from predators allowing for possible breeding spots. The rushes also provide habitats for frogs including the Striped Marsh Frog (Limnodynastes peroni) and the Eastern Dwarf Tree Frog (Vitoria fallax). The lagoons surface is also populated with native Bladderwort (Utricularia australians).The Bladderwort also provides foraging habitat on the lagoons surface. It is these native species which the surrounding area of the lagoon and its surrounding areas play host to that give the area its aesthetic significance.  Pollution of the Lagoon  The damming of the left side of the lagoon for the zig zag railway has caused issues for the lagoon mainly because it caused the lagoon to become a closed water system and any pollutants are unable to be flushed out of the lagoon naturally. In turn this has led to a significant buildup of pollutants carried by storm water into the lagoon. Without proper drainage of this water, significant environmental issues have risen including the growth of noxious weeds which have effectively chocked out natural aquatic flora and fauna living in the lagoon. The urbanisation of the area surrounding the lagoon has also contributed to the pollution of the lagoon. The land which naturally drains to the lagoon is now built over with houses and shops this causes polluted storm water to run straight into the lagoon. The polluted water can contain many chemicals and organic matter which are dangerous and may compromise the survival of the lagoon. These materials can include herbicides, fertilisers, Grey water use, oil and petrol, sediment, sewage, animal faeces, garden waste, litter and contaminants. Without proper drainage surrounding the lagoon the run off of this polluted water into the lagoon encourages the growth of noxious weeds. The growth of these noxious weeds can also be attributed to the dumping of domestic aquarium plants in the lagoon. The two noxious weeds which are of concern to the health of the lagoon are the Cabomba weed (Cabomba caroliniana) and Salvina weed (Salvinia Molesta). Both of which have caused a variety of significant problems for the survival of the lagoon and its ecosystem. Cabomba has been listed as a class 5 noxious weed and also as a weed of significance and had been notably difficult to remove in past situations. Both of the noxious weeds (Cabomba and Salvina) cause severe oxygen depletion in the lagoon as they die and decompose using most of the dissolved oxygen available in the lagoon. This makes survival difficult for other aquatic organisms including native water plants, native fish and turtles.  Treatment of Cabomba and Salvina Weeds  The presence of The Cabomba and Salvina weeds in the lagoon posed a serious threat to native flora and fauna and also introduced the threat of the noxious weeds spreading into nearby waterways such as the Nepean river, Hawkesbury river and the many waterways within Blue Mountains National Park including catchments which lead to Warragamba Dam. The Dam is a major waterway which provides much of Western Sydneys drinking water. In order to combat this threat during 2006 a $95 000 grant was given to the Blue mountains city council to commence work on re-generating the lagoon and removing the noxious weed Salvina. Regeneration efforts involved the mechanical harvesting of 200 tonnes of Salvina and also the use of herbicide spot treatment with some hand removal of the remaining weeds. However up until 2012, 100 percent of the Lagoons water column was still filled with the noxious Cabomba weed. In 2012 the Blue Mountains city council was given another grant to remove the Cabomba weed. Removal of the Cabomba weed in December 2012 included the use of the herbicide Carfentrazone-ethyl which was intended only to kill off 50% of the Cabomba weed growth in the lagoon. However the herbicide successfully killed off the Cabomba weed entirely from the water body. The removal was considered a success however during this treatment some native fish mortalities occurred due to oxygen depletion levels this caused levels of fish species living within the lagoon to diminish. These declining oxygen levels where attributed to the large amounts of breakdown of the dead Cabomba weed matter caused by the use of the herbicide. To combat these declining dissolved oxygen levels Generators and pumps were brought to the lagoon attempt to re-oxygenate the water. However these efforts produced limited results the task of re-oxygenating the lagoon proving to difficult with the little power supply to run the generators and pumps and noise complaints from local residents. A water quality monitoring program was also set up at the time these attempts to kill off the weed were implemented. The hopes of this program were that it would be able to successfully monitor water quality, biodiversity and weed control outcomes of the lagoon. This was the first removal of the Cabomba weed on a large scale area in New South Wales using the chemical Carfentrazone-ethyl. Bush-care groups continue regeneration work on the lagoon and its surrounding areas in hopes of restoring the natural environment to provide habitats for the native fauna and flora. These Bush- care groups also encourage the use of native aquarium plants instead of exotic and noxious ones such as Cabomba, as it is believed that the dumping of these noxious weeds caused there significant growth and presence within the lagoon.  Current State of the Lagoon  Regeneration efforts at Glenbrook lagoon have resulted in a 99% decrease of the noxious weed Salvina. A 2014 weed monitoring survey found there to be no trace of the Cabomba weed in Glenbrook lagoon. However, in January 2107 there was found to be some regrowth of the noxious weed. Due to the dispersed nature of the regrowth of the Cabomba weed a large scale herbicide treatment would not have been effective. In efforts to quickly remove the weed and stop its presence reaching high levels, scuba divers were sent into the lagoon to remove the regrowth of the noxious weed in areas which were deeper than one metre ensuring that the root and crown of the plant was removed. The weed was again removed by hand and wading in shallower areas. Regeneration efforts have also seen an increase in turtle and fish numbers in recent years, with many native species once again becoming self sustaining. Recent surveys by Biosis have determined a rise in species such as the Fresh water catfish (Tandnus tandanus), Australian Smelt (Retropinna semoni ), Flat-headed gudgeon (Philypndon grandiceps) and long-finned eel (Angulla reinhardtii) The Blue mountains council has worked with local bush care groups to augment habitats to form a natural environment that promotes the self sustaining nature of native fish and deters the survival of some noxious fish which were reported by biosis to be inhabiting the lagoon. There has also been increases in numbers of two species of turtles. The Eastern Long-necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) and Sydney basin turtles (Emydura macquarii) A conscious effort is being made by these local bush regeneration groups to ensure the continued breeding success. There has also been a continuous rise in numbers of aquatic insects which are sensitive to pollution. These increases in aquatic species can be attributed to the removal of noxious weeds and upgrades to storm water treatment around the lagoon. However, in order to maintain the low levels of pollution and occurrence of noxious weeds a secondary Cabomba Weed Control Program has been implemented. The weed control program plans to continuously remove any regrowth of noxious weeds from the lagoon. The program also plans to regularly monitor the water pollution levels in the lagoon. It is hoped that through these efforts the lagoon will remain as a healthy eco-system and will continue to be a sustainable habitat for native flora and fauna.

Both attractions opened in Spring of 2005. The Hollywood attraction was closed on August 14, 2008 to make way for Creature from the Black Lagoon: The Musical, which opened in Spring 2009. The Florida attraction began operating on a seasonal schedule on June 3, 2005. The attraction began running again on a full-time basis (except for Halloween Horror Nights considerations) in the Summer of 2010. The attraction is based on the NBC television series Fear Factor, and features theme park guests becoming contestants in various stunts inspired by the show. Universal Studios Florida The stage at Universal Studios Florida =Main show= There are 3 main stunts in each show (which uses volunteers which are picked before the show for controlling of the stunt elements), along with two mini-stunts (which uses volunteers which are selected at least 30 minutes prior to each show). Main stunts =Stunt 1: Endurance Hang= In the Endurance Hang, 6 contestants are asked to hang from a stationary \\"y-bar\\" 35 feet in the air and will have to hang on as long as they can. Adding to the challenge is that 0:15 seconds during the stunt, fans (controlled by volunteers) will be activated which blow strongly towards the contestants. The first 2 contestants that drop will be eliminated and asked to make the \\"Walk of Shame\\". =Stunt 2: Eel Tank Relay= This stunt consists of two parts, and the 4 remaining contestants will be paired up in groups of two (one of them will be tethered while the other one is not). The first part of the stunt has the non-tethered contestants retrieve bean bags from an aquarium full of \\"carnivorous eels\\". The second part consists of the non-tethered contestants throwing the beanbags to their tethered partners holding buckets, however instead of beanbags, \\"rancid\\" octopuses will be used (and the amount of octopuses thrown by the non tethered contestants is determined by the amount of beanbags retrieved in the first part). Adding to the challenge to the second part is that volunteers will use water cannons to impede the progress of each team. Both parts of the eel tank relay has a 30-second time limit. The winning team is determined by whoever can get the most squid within the 30 second limit. In the event of a tie, the team that had a member hold on the longest during the first stunt (Endurance Hang) will bring their partner to the finale. =Stunt 3: Stuntman's Challenge= In the final stunt the winning team of the Eel Tank Relay is split up again, and will pit both remaining contestants against each other. The first segment involves both contestants retrieving four (4) flags which are hung from window sills. Adding to the challenge to this segment are 3 things: rain sprinklers, air cannons which blast wind from the windows, and a foam ball cannon (which is similar to the ones in the ball factory in Curious George Goes to Town at Woody Woodpecker's KidZone) which shoots balls. Once all flags are retrieved, the players end up getting into a yellow convertible where they must wait until they reach the top (28 feet in the air ‚Äì 15 degree angle). Once the car reaches the top, the contestant will retrieve flags from the car. Once again, the volunteers picked before the show will be impeding the contestants by triggering rain sprinklers. Once all flags are retrieved, the contestant will be able to pick up a \\"rocket launcher\\" to shoot at a target. When this happens, three pyrotechnic cues are hit, and the building facade falls on the host and the winner is declared. Mini-stunts =Mini Stunt 1: Desert Hat Ordeal= In this mini stunt which happens between the Endurance Hang and Eel Tank Relay stunts, a volunteer will be strapped to a chair where their head will be encased in a transparent box while wearing protective equipment (swimming goggles for eye protection and a mask which covers the nose and mouth). Then the volunteer's partner will be asked to spin a wheel which determines what will be placed in the box (this includes scorpions, snakes, spiders, cockroaches), however, the wheel always lands on scorpions so the spinning of the wheel is actually irrelevant. =Mini Stunt 2: Guess What's Crawling to Dinner= In this mini-stunt which happens between the Eel Tank Relay and Stuntman's Challenge stunts. Two teams of two guests each will have 30 seconds to complete a mixture of meat, seafood, \\"sour milk\\" and insects. Whichever team completes both mixtures will be the winners of this stunt. =Trivia= * The Desert Hat Ordeal mini-stunt is probably adapted from a mini-show which was held in 2003 during Halloween Horror Nights 13 called \\"Infestation\\" which was hosted by The Director (who was the icon for that year). * The ending to Fear Factor Live in Florida uses the same \\"falling building\\" facade which was used for the Wild Wild West Stunt Show which used to occupy the stage that Fear Factor Live is located in. * In the finale of the show the host wears a yellow rain coat. This is not to protect him from the rain, in fact he does not come into contact with any water, it's to protect him from the explosion at the end. Universal Studios Hollywood =Stunt 1: Endurance Hang= The Endurance Hang for the Hollywood version of the show was almost identical to the Orlando version, however it didn't have the industrial fans which blew the contestants. =Stunt 2: Eel Tank Relay= Although sharing the same name with the Orlando version, the stunts are completely different. The four remaining contestants from Stunt 1 have to collect flags from a tank full of eels, and then put them onto a hanging pole which has their contestant number on it. While doing this, there is a rotating 'roundabout' section of the stage which has a few obstructions to make it more difficult for the contestant to put the flag onto their pole. Once repeating this to get 3 flags, one at a time, they then can go to a table which has smoothies made from fish guts, pig hearts and dead insects. They must drink the entire smoothie to win. The first 2 contestants to do this move on to the final round. =Stunt 3: Shock and Roll= In the final stunt, the two contestants must hold onto a wheel with 2 electrodes on it, and spin the wheel to add to an illuminated meter. While doing this, they would be electrocuted with a \\"high voltage\\" current, and the higher the meter got, the more frequent the shocks would be. The contestants are also attached to bungee cords, which resulted in the loser to be catapulted away from the wheel. The presenter also claimed that the audience must \\"be seated at all times, on their metal seats\\", which appears to be a joke, although claimed to not be. Audience participation Universal invites guests to become contestants in the show. Guests who wish to participate must be at least 18 years of age or older and may sign in at a booth located across from the attraction. Guests sitting in the front rows during the show are also invited to participate during the performance. History The show opened in May 2005 at both theme parks, replacing The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show at the Florida venue and Spider- Man Rocks at the Hollywood venue. The Hollywood venue closed on August 14, 2008 due to lack of popularity, was replaced by \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon: The Musical.\\" The venue at Universal Studios Florida is shut down in the Fall season to allow performances of \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure\\" during Halloween Horror Nights, which takes place late September through early November allowing the attraction to re-open in mid-November. Universal Studios Florida's \\"Fear Factor Live\\" attraction was temporarily closed February 5, 2009, a casualty of the current global economic crisis. The park expects to offer the attraction during peak attendance periods, if demand calls for it. The attraction was open from April 4 until April 18, 2009 for Spring Break performances. Since summer 2010, the show has remained open in a full-time, non-seasonal capacity (outside of the three-month closure for \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure\\").

The Vaughan family bought 600 hectares and farmed sheep from 1862 until selling their land to the Auckland Regional Council in 1965 to form the park. A gun emplacement was built on the coast north of the park to defend against invasion by Japanese forces during the Second World War. Remnants of the emplacement still exist.

He is vice president of Cohmad Securities Corporation. Biography Jaffe is married to Ellen Shapiro, daughter of Boston philanthropist Carl J. Shapiro, the founder and former chairman of apparel company Kay Windsor Inc. and an early investor and close friend of Madoff. Jaffe reportedly convinced the elder Shapiro to invest $250 million with Madoff just ten days before Madoff's arrest. Jaffe resides in Palm Beach, Florida.  Cohmad Securities Corporation  Maurice \\"Sonny\\" Cohn owned 48% of Cohmad, and his daughter Marcia, who served as president and chief compliance officer, owned 25%. Madoff owned 15%. Mr. Madoff's brother Peter owned 9%, and Mr. Cohn's brother owned 1%, and another unnamed Cohmad employee owned 1%. The brokerage firm lists its address as Madoff's firm's address in New York City. Cohmad received $67 million in generated fees from Madoff investments, from 2000 to 2008. =Bernard Madoff agent= A bon vivant and philanthropist, Jaffe \\"worked the Palm Beach, Florida circuit\\", and attracted many Palm Beach Country Club members as investors.\\" Jaffe brought in 150 accounts and more than $1 billion to Madoff. Madoff paid Jaffe directly through accounts he kept with Madoff at much higher returns than earned by other investors. Between 1996 and 2008, Jaffe withdrew at least $150 million, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claims he was aware Madoff was engaged in fictitious trading. Jaffe has said he received a commission of 1% to 2% from an investor's first profit, and he paid commissions to financial advisers who steered cash to Madoff's fund.  Civil lawsuits  On January 14, 2009, William Galvin, Secretary of State of Massachusetts, in charge of securities issues for Massachusetts, filed suit against Jaffe. On February 4, compelled to testify, Jaffe invoked his Fifth Amendment right. He responded that he was also one of Madoff's victims. On May 8, 2009, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts found the firm to be in \\"default\\" for not assisting regulators. Cohmad's securities registration has been revoked, and they must provide an accounting of all fees the company or its agents earned for referring Massachusetts investors to Mr. Madoff's firm as well as, pay a $100,000 fine for failing to cooperate with the state securities investigation. On June 22, 2009, Madoff Trustee Irving Picard filed a claim against Cohmad. Jaffe was named as a defendant among more than two dozen individuals and trusts in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The lawsuit claims that up to 90 percent of Cohmad's income came from referring clients and that the firm had a \\"symbiotic\\" relationship with Madoff, having earned hundreds of millions of dollars from the fraud. The lawsuit seeks more than $100 million paid to Cohmad six years prior to Madoff‚Äôs firm declaring bankruptcy, and more than $105 million in profits Cohmad employees and their families withdrew from the investment accounts they held with Madoff. The case is Picard v. Cohmad Securities Corp., 09-AP-1305, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). On June 22, 2009, the SEC also filed civil fraud charges against Cohmad, and Jaffe was also named as a defendant. The lawsuit alleges the company was Madoff's \\"in-house marketing arm\\" and critical to Madoff's scam. Cohmad representatives were paid for funds they brought into the firm but not for any increase in the investments' value. Withdrawals were treated as a loss, which \\"suggested that profits generated by Madoff were fictitious\\", but Madoff changed the arrangement in 2002 and began paying Cohmad representatives $2 million a year.

It is the only part of the U.S. Military Academy Reservation on the east side of the Hudson River. Formerly known as \\"Martelaer's Rock\\", Constitution Island is the site of the earliest Revolutionary War fortifications in the Hudson Valley. Taken briefly by the British in 1777, the island was re-occupied by American forces in 1778, and made an integral part of Fortress West Point. The island was bequeathed to the military academy in 1909 and has been administered by the West Point Museum ever since. The Education Center was completed in 2016, the Warner House has been completely restored and will be ready as a Museum again in the Spring of 2020. Martelaer's Rock Between Cold Spring and West Point lay a large rocky island connected to the eastern shore by a reedy marsh. Dutch Navigators called it Martelaer's Island and the part of the river between it and Storm King Mountain, Martelaer's Rack, or Martyr's Reach. The word \\"martyr\\" signified \\"struggling\\", as vessels coming up the river with a fair wind would frequently find themselves, immediately after passing the point of the island into the reach, contending with the wind ahead.Lossing, Benson John. The Hudson, from the Wilderness to the Sea, New York, Virtue and Yorston, 1866 Fort Constitution Constitution Island seen from US Route 9W The strategic importance of the ability to control navigation along the Hudson River was obvious to both the Americans and the British from the outbreak of open hostilities. The Hudson was the major means for transportation of supplies and troops throughout a large portion of the northeast. On May 25, 1775 the Continental Congress resolved to build fortifications in the Hudson highlands for the purpose of protecting and maintaining control of the Hudson River. General George Washington was appointed by the Continental Congress to work with the New York Provincial Congress to draft plans as to how the Hudson River should be fortified against the British. Local residents James Clinton and Christopher Tappan were sent to scout appropriate locations. The initial site chosen was Martlaer's Island, across from West Point. Located on a strategic curve in the Hudson River, engineer Bernard Romans, was appointed to begin the construction of a large fort on the island which was to be named ‚ÄúFort Constitution\\".\\"The Revolutionary War\\", Constitution Island Association West Point Plans for the fort called for four bastions. Construction of the fortifications began in the summer of 1775, and the island was soon known as Constitution Island. By November it had 70 cannons. However, difficulties in construction and management of the original plan of fortifications, together with escalating costs, led to abandonment of that project. A site at Popolopen Creek across from Anthony's Nose was proposed, and in January 1776, the materials and resources from Fort Constitution were redirected to the construction at the new site.\\"Fort Constitution\\", New York State Military Museum The building of Fort Constitution was suspended while the militia concentrated their efforts on building Forts Clinton, Montgomery and Independence south of the island in the hope of containing the British further downstream.Wade, William. Virtual Trip up the Hudson, 1846 The earthworks at Fort Constitution were unfinished when British troops destroyed them in 1777. In 1778 Polish engineer Thaddeus Kosciusko began designing Fortress West Point as a series of forts and redoubts on both sides of the river. On Constitution Island, a barracks, three redoubts, and a water battery were constructed. Chain The island is perhaps best known as the eastern anchor-point for the Great Chain, a massive iron structure that stretched across the narrow bend in the Hudson between the island and the mainland at West Point. The chain was intended to prevent British naval vessels from navigating freely along the Hudson. This was the second attempt to string a chain across the Hudson River in an effort to prevent the British from taking control of the Hudson thereby splitting the American colonies. The first chain, which weighed 35 tons and was 1650 yards long stretched between the base of Fort Montgomery and the rock at Anthony's Nose. That chain failed to stop the British forces when they attacked Forts Montgomery and Clinton. That chain was dismantled by the British. The Great Chain remained in place (except during months when ice blocked the river) from 1778 to 1782. After the war, Constitution Island returned to civilian use.Dunwell, F.F., 1991, The Hudson River highlands, New York: Columbia University Press, Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko along with Thomas Machin designed a capstan for reeling in the chain. Kosciuszko also added the Lanthorn Battery at Gee's Point and the Knox Battery to cover the South Dock. The original iron chain, with one and a half inch thick links, was replaced in 1778 with links two and a quarter inches thick, which were two feet long and weighed 140 pounds. Made by Peter Townsend's Stirling Iron Works in Warwick, New York, the 1500 foot long chain weighed 186 tons. Kept afloat on huge logs, forty men removed the chain in winter.Storozynski, A., 2009, The Peasant Prince, New York: St. Martin's Press, Warner House The Warner House as part of the National Historic Landmark of the United States Military Academy, is located on Constitution Island and administered by the West Point Museum, United States Military Academy. The Warner family owned the island and lived in the house from 1838 to 1915. Sisters Susan Bogert Warner and Anna Bartlett Warner were popular, prolific novelists whose works sold millions of copies in the United States, England and elsewhere. The Warner sisters are recognized as among the most significant American women writers of the nineteenth century. Anna Bartlett Warner's most well known song is Jesus Loves Me. In 1908, seven years before her death, Anna Warner sold the island to Mrs. Margaret Sage, widow of the financier Russell Sage. In 1908, Mrs. Russell Sage and Miss Anna Warner presented Constitution Island to the United States government as a joint gift according to the following stipulations: ‚ÄúLawrence, L.I., September 4, 1908, The President: Sir: I take pleasure in tendering as a gift to the United States from myself and Miss Anna Bartlett Warner, Constitution Island, opposite of West Point‚Ä¶to be an addition to the Military Academy‚Ä¶under the following conditions: First: That ‚Äòthe Island be for the use forever of the United States Military Academy at West Point‚Ä¶that no part of it shall ever be used as a public picnic, excursion, or amusement ground, operated by private enterprise, individual or corporate, for profit‚Ä¶‚Äù The president sent the following letter to Mrs. Sage. ‚ÄúMy dear Mrs. Sage: I have received your letter of September 4th. I wish to thank you for your very generous gift to the Nation, and I have written Miss Warner thanking her‚Ä¶. Permit me now, on behalf of the Nation, to thank you most heartily again for a really patriotic act. With regard, Yours sincerely, Theodore Roosevelt.‚Äù Both sisters are buried at West Point Cemetery. The Constitution Island Association, a not-for-profit organization, traditionally provides historic and cultural tours for visitors to the island and maintains the extensive gardens surrounding the Warner House. At this time, the Warner House has been closed to visitors because the structure has become unsafe. The garden and grounds are open for visiting on certain days in the summer. The Military Academy has made improvements to the site including upgrades to the roadways, drainage, support facilities and trails. The West Point Museum and United States Army Garrison have begun the construction of an Education Center on the island. The project is a joint effort of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Directorate of Public Works, West Point and the West Point Museum and solely funded by the United States Army Garrison, West Point.

He was initially a disciple of the short-lived Darumash≈´ sect of Japanese Zen founded by N≈çnin, but later studied and received dharma transmission under the S≈çt≈ç schools founder D≈çgen. Today Ej≈ç is considered D≈çgen's spiritual successor by all existing branches of the S≈çt≈ç school. He is remembered today primarily as the author of the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç Zuimonki, a collection of informal talks by D≈çgen which Ej≈ç recorded throughout his discipleship. He is also featured prominently in the Denk≈çroku, the first major piece of scripture produced in the S≈çt≈ç school after D≈çgen, with his transmission story serving as the final koan. After D≈çgen's death, Ej≈ç struggled to maintain leadership of the new Eihei-ji monastery, due in part to his lack of training in China that prevented him from completing the temple as a Chinese-style meditation hall, as well as unfamiliarity with Chinese-style monastic practices. He gave dharma transmission to Jakuen, Gikai, Gien and Giin, all of whom were originally students of D≈çgen, but his failure to designate a clear heir himself led to a power struggle known as the sandai s≈çron that temporarily split the community. Biography =Early life= Koun Ej≈ç was born into the powerful Fujiwara clan in 1198 to an aristocratic family. His early education took place in Kyoto, after which he went to Mount Hiei to study Buddhism in the Tendai school while still young. In 1215, he was ordained as a monk and in 1218, he took the Bodhisattva vows at Enryaku-ji under his teacher Enn≈ç. He would have studied Tendai and Shingon extensively, but dissatisfaction with these led him to examine Pure Land Buddhism. In 1219 he left Mount Hiei to study in the J≈çdo school under Zenneb≈ç Sh≈çku, a disciple of H≈çnen, at ≈åj≈ç-in (now called Gi≈ç- ji). Apparently dissatisfied with the school, he left in 1222 or 1223 to study in the Daruma school, which had been founded by Dainichib≈ç N≈çnin about a decade before Koun Ej≈ç's birth. His teacher, Kakuan, a disciple of N≈çnin, had his community of monks in T≈çnomine, outside Nara, apparently after having fled from Mount Hiei, where they had been persecuted by members of the Tendai school. Ej≈ç is reported to have been a prominent student under Kakuan, but his time there was cut short in 1228 when representatives of the Tendai temple K≈çfuku-ji in Nara burned down the buildings in the Daruma school temple complex, seemingly in response the perceived threat posed by its new teachings; the students were thus forced to disperse. =First encounters with D≈çgen= After the destruction of Kakuan's group in T≈çnomine, Koun Ej≈ç returned to Kyoto. It was during this visit in 1228 that Ej≈ç met D≈çgen at Kennin-ji, where he had been studying under Eisai after his return from China. Ej≈ç may have been prompted to visit following the impact of D≈çgen's first work, Fukanzazengi. According to the Denk≈çroku, the two men discussed their respective experiences with Zen at length. While they initially agreed on their shared insights, at some point the two began to disagree. Ultimately, Ej≈ç felt convinced that D≈çgen's accounts of his experiences were superior to his own. He thus asked D≈çgen to become his teacher, but D≈çgen declined citing a lack of practice space. Other accounts claim that Ej≈ç was not convinced by D≈çgen's philosophy at this first meeting and he instead left their encounter in frustration. According to these accounts, it was only after a later meeting that Ej≈ç requested to become a student. Ej≈ç probably returned to T≈çnomine to live with his master Kakuan after this episode in Kyoto. However, Kakuan soon became sick and died sometime around 1234. Following his master's death, Ej≈ç left for Kannon-d≈çri-in (later changed to K≈çsh≈çh≈çrin-ji), D≈çgen's newly established temple in Uji, where he would finally become his student. =Ordination at K≈çsh≈çh≈çrin-ji= After about a year living at D≈çgen's new temple, Ej≈ç was accepted as a student and ordained into the lineage on 15 August 1235. Shortly after this event, Ej≈ç took part in the planning of the s≈çd≈ç (ÂÉßÂ†Ç; meditation hall) which was to be built there, and also oversaw its dedication in October 1236. According to hagiography, it was around this time that Ej≈ç had an enlightenment experience. D≈çgen was reading a k≈çan to his students in which a monk asks Shishuang Chuyuan, \\"How is it that one hair digs many ditches\\"?, reportedly triggering his experience. This is thought to have taken place in November 1236. According to Dairy≈ç Gumon, writing much later in the 17th century, Ej≈ç received dharma transmission from D≈çgen just after this event, complete with the presentation of certification documents. The following month, Ej≈ç was made shuso (È¶ñÂ∫ß; head monk). Following these events, regardless of the veracity of Gumon's claims, contemporary historical sources such as the Denk≈çroku agree that Ej≈ç was treated as D≈çgen's heir, serving as his closest attendant. The Denk≈çroku states: \\"Throughout the day, he was inseparable from the master, like a trailing shadow\\". During his first few years at K≈çsh≈çh≈çrin-ji, he began to record D≈çgen's teachings in what became known as the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç zuimonki. He wrote the work in every-day Japanese rather than Chinese, the intellectual language of the time. To this day, it is considered one of the more easily understood of D≈çgen's work, although the topics included seem to be a reflection of Ej≈ç's interests. His mother also became ill during this period and died soon thereafter. Ej≈ç apparently visited her during her illness during an allotted six-day vacation period following the winter sesshin, but shortly after he returned, he was informed his mother's condition had worsened and she would likely soon expire. However, because he had already used his allowed free time, he decided not to return to her side, instead choosing to strictly observe monastic regulations. =Transition to Echizen= In the summer of 1243, Ej≈ç left K≈çsh≈çh≈çrin-ji for Echizen with D≈çgen and his other students after Hatano Yoshishige, a magistrate from that area, offered land and protection for a new monastery. D≈çgen and his followers accepted the offer largely because of continuous tensions with the Tendai community in Kyoto which threatened the long-term stability of their practice. Before the construction of the new temple had been completed, the monks stayed at the temples Kipp≈ç-ji and Yamashibu. During this time, Ej≈ç served D≈çgen as before, continued a project managing the texts for what would become D≈çgen's magnum opus, the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç (not to be confused with the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç zuimonki mentioned above), and also assisting in the planning of the new temple being constructed. In the summer of 1244 the hatt≈ç (Ê≥ïÂ†Ç; dharma hall) of the new temple, originally called Daibutsu-ji, was completed. In June 1246, the temple name was changed to what it is still known as to this day: Eihei-ji. For these first years at the new temple, Ej≈ç found himself taking on many of the responsibilities for the day-to-day functioning of the new temple. He simultaneously began work on Eihei k≈çroku (Broad Record of Eihei) and Eihei shingi (Pure Criteria of Eihei) with the help of the other students Gien and Sene. =D≈çgen's death and Ej≈ç as second abbot of Eihei- ji= Ej≈ç accompanied D≈çgen to Kamakura, then the capital of Japan, during a six-month visit starting in 1247 on which he taught H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori, the sh≈çgun's regent. They returned in 1248, during which time Ej≈ç continued his recordings of D≈çgen's sermons, which increased in frequency during these years. By the fall of 1252, D≈çgen had become sick. In expectation of his approaching death, in the summer of 1253 he passed Ej≈ç's responsibilities on to Tetts≈´ Gikai and installed Ej≈ç as the second abbot of Eihei-ji. D≈çgen left for Kyoto to seek medical assistance, but died a few days after his arrival there on 28 August, leaving Ej≈ç as the sole leader of Eihei-ji. Ej≈ç's first act was to have a pagoda built in D≈çgen's honour. Ej≈ç's tenure as abbot attempted to keep things at Eihei-ji as they were. Unfortunately, he was not gifted with D≈çgen's keen leadership abilities, and he had the most trouble with his former fellow students of the Darumash≈´, who saw him as an equal and not an authority figure. Problems also arose with the question of a successor. D≈çgen had clearly considered Tetts≈´ Gikai a preeminent disciple, which Ej≈ç well knew. However, he disliked Gikai's desire to reintroduce aspects of Darumash≈´ practice that D≈çgen had rejected, and D≈çgen himself had commented on his lack of compassion in his interactions with other monks. Nonetheless, Ej≈ç formally made Gikai his heir in January 1256 after making him agree to uphold D≈çgen's teachings above all else. After this, Ej≈ç sent Gikai on a pilgrimage of Zen temples in Japan, which Gikai voluntarily extended to include a visit to China, whence he returned in 1262. =Start of sandai s≈çron and death= Gikai's return marked the beginning of what is known as the sandai s≈çron, a schism that would split D≈çgen's community into multiple competing factions. Because Gikai had an interest in architecture and had recorded temple constructions during his time in China, Ej≈ç allowed him to take control of the ongoing building projects at Eihei-ji. In 1267, Ej≈ç had become ill and decided to retire as abbot. He moved out of Eihei-ji to a nearby location, but continued to be considered the t≈çd≈çi, a rank for retired abbots. Two monks, Buss≈ç and D≈çson, are even said to have attained enlightenment under him during his stay outside the temple. At any rate, his health had improved within a short time of leaving Eihei-ji. Meanwhile, Gikai was deeply unpopular at Eihei-ji. Despite his assurances to Ej≈ç to the contrary, he attempted to reform the practices at Eihei-ji, which were generally seen by the monks as an affront to D≈çgen's teachings. He focused on building projects and expansion of the physical aspects of the school while apparently ignoring D≈çgen's preference for poverty. Especially unpopular was his attempt to introduce rituals from the Shingon school which D≈çgen had expressly condemned. Rather than face a popular uprising, he decided to step down as abbot and Ej≈ç was asked to return in that capacity in 1272. Ej≈ç worked to reconcile the competing factions in the community. By 1280 he had become ill again and began to prepare for his death. He requested that no pagoda be built for him, but rather that he be buried next to D≈çgen's pagoda. After he died, confusion surrounded who should next lead the community, culminating in the climax of the sandai s≈çron, with several of D≈çgen's students, especially Gikai and Gien, claiming the right to the abbotship.

He began his Buddhist life as a student of the Darumash≈´'s Ekan, but later both became students of Eihei D≈çgen's newly established S≈çt≈ç school. Gikai received dharma transmission from Koun Ej≈ç, D≈çgen's successor, and later became the third abbot of the school's head temple, Eihei-ji. Shortly thereafter, he became embroiled in a leadership crisis known as the sandai s≈çron. Other monks contended that other students, namely Jakuen, Gien or Giin, had stronger claims to the abbacy. The controversy remained unresolved at the time of his death. His abbacy was unpopular with some monks because he introduced innovative practices aimed at making S≈çt≈ç more palatable with the Japanese laity, which some claimed D≈çgen would have frowned upon. However, he also had many followers, and eventually his innovations became the standard form of S≈çt≈ç Zen. His leadership marked the first geographical expansion of the S≈çt≈ç school when he moved with his followers to Kaga Province. Most notably, his disciple Keizan J≈çkin became the second most famous figure in the school's history after D≈çgen by generating mass appeal for S≈çt≈ç Zen and ultimately spreading the teachings to all corners of Japan. Early life Tetts≈´ Gikai was born in 1219 in a rural area of Echizen Province called Inazu. His family was part of the powerful Fujiwara clan, specifically claiming descent from the famous General Fujiwara no Toshihito. Members of this extended family included prominent monks of the region. Others had formed bonds through marriage with the Hatano family, which was to become the primary donor to the early S≈çt≈ç school. He became a monk at the age of twelve at a Darumash≈´ temple called Hajaku-ji, which was located close to the future site of S≈çt≈ç Zen's main temple, Eihei-ji. His teacher was Ekan, a student of Kakuan, in turn a student of the Darumash≈´'s founder N≈çnin. His close connections to Echizen, and particularly its Buddhist elite, played a role in his importance to the early S≈çt≈ç school. Joining D≈çgen's S≈çt≈ç School Shortly after becoming a monk, Gikai relocated to Mt. Hiei for an unknown period of time for training, although he remained a student of Ekan. In 1241, most of the students of the Darumash≈´ joined Eihei D≈çgen's early S≈çt≈ç school, which at that time was centered at K≈çsh≈ç-ji outside of Kyoto. Thus Ekan and Gikai both became students of D≈çgen, although to an extent Gikai remained a student of Ekan simultaneously. In 1243, shortly after D≈çgen and his followers had moved to Echizen where Eihei-ji would be built, Gikai was assigned to the important position of tenzo, or head cook. D≈çgen considered tenzo to be suitable only for monks of high attainment, but on a more practical level Gikai was probably also better equipped to locate donors of food in his home province. About a decade later in 1251, Ekan gave dharma transmission of his Darumash≈´ lineage to Gikai realizing that he would soon die without a successor. However, he also urged Ekan to receive transmission of the S≈çt≈ç lineage as well. Four years later in 1255, two years after D≈çgen's death, Gikai accomplished this when he received dharma transmission from his former fellow Darumash≈´ student and D≈çgen's successor, Koun Ej≈ç. Abbot of Eihei-ji and Departure In 1267 Tetts≈´ Gikai became abbot of Eihei-ji when Koun Ej≈ç, the previous abbot, retired due to illness. Gikai's promotion to abbot was specifically requested by the two major patrons of the temple. Keizan J≈çkin, who would go on to become an extremely important leader for the school, was ordained as a monk by Gikai in 1271 when Keizan was seven. The following year Gikai retired from his role as abbot, eventually being replaced by Gien, whose life and time at Eihei-ji is poorly documented. Gikai lived for the next 20 years caring for his mother near Eihei-ji and occasionally visiting the temple for various reasons. In 1280 he cared for his predecessor Ej≈ç in the days before his death. During this time, Ej≈ç apparently gave Gikai his robes, which he had in turn received from D≈çgen. Nine days later Ej≈ç died, after which Gikai performed the funeral. Gikai also held yearly services to commemorate Ej≈ç's death, and it was during this period that a conflict arose between him and the followers of Ej≈ç's other successor Jakuen. The reason for the dispute is not clear. Jakuen himself had left Eihei-ji many years before in 1261. Whatever the grounds, Gikai ultimately permanently departed from Eihei-ji in 1287 despite personal support from the temple's major patron. Abbot of Daij≈ç-ji and Death Gikai left Eihei-ji and traveled to the neighboring province of Kaga where he became the second abbot of Daij≈ç-ji temple in 1293. The first abbot, Ch≈çkai, was of the esoteric Shingon school and had probably known Gikai from his early years at Hajaku-ji, which was a Shingon temple that had hosted Darumash≈´ students for several years. Furthermore, the temple was patronized by Togashi Iehisa of the Fujiwara clan, most likely a relative of Gikai. Several students from Eihei-ji joined Gikai at his new temple, including Keizan J≈çkin, Meih≈ç Sotetsu, and Gasan J≈çseki. Two years after Gikai's arrival, he gave dharma transmission to Keizan. Three years later in 1298 Gikai passed on the position of abbot to Keizan as well, though he remained at the temple for the rest of his life. By 1306 Gikai's health began to decline. During this period he ordained all of the non-monk workers at the temple at his own insistence. He died in 1309. Keizan only served as abbot for two years after Gikai's death, after which the position was transferred to Meih≈ç Sotetsu. Shortly after, the patrons of the temple replaced Meih≈ç with a Rinzai monk for unknown reasons. Keizan wrote that this was a betrayal of Gikai, although Meih≈ç would go on to be reinstated as the abbot of Daij≈ç-ji after many years. References * William M. Bodiford.

Speech Bush's inaugural address, delivered in 21 minutes, centered on and expanded upon previous foreign policy remarks concerning the promotion of democracy around the world, as well as making human rights the guiding principle of US foreign policy. According to William Safire, Bush had told his chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson, \\"I want this to be the freedom speech.\\" And later: Combined, the speech used the words \\"free,\\" \\"freedom,\\" and \\"liberty\\" 49 times.

President Bush and the First Lady, Laura Bush, left their bullet- proof limousine and walked some of the route. Besides the usual parade formations from the United States Armed Forces, the parade also featured bands such as the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band and units such as the Governor's Guards. Security As the first presidential inauguration after the September 11 attacks, security was tighter than previous ceremonies. The inaugural parade route as well as other related sites were guarded by 13,000 police and soldiers, in addition to aerial patrols by helicopter and fighter aircraft and rooftop sharpshooters. In downtown Washington, a 100 square block area was closed to traffic. Protests Many protested at the ceremonies and five people were arrested during the inauguration ceremony.\\"Bush: Expand freedom 'in all the world'\\" CNN, January 21, 2005. Last accessed January 22, 2009. Protestors worked to block access to the actual swearing in ceremony. Tickets were given out only by state senators and representatives, and a few RNC officials. Ticketholders, who were from all over the country, were advised not to bring backpacks or bags, and were told such items wouldn't be allowed through security. Protestors obtained tickets, and then brought large bags to the event, clogging security checkpoints. Rather than directing all bag holders to one security screening line, security officials allowed the lines to be clogged, preventing many people from entering the secured area to view/hear President Bush and Vice-President Cheney. Protesters standing in line cheered the success of their actions, and were quite pleased that they denied people the opportunity to see the ceremony. See also *Presidency of George W.

Definition A Buekenhout geometry consists of a set X whose elements are called \\"varieties\\", with a symmetric reflexive relation on X called \\"incidence\\", together with a function œÑ called the \\"type map\\" from X to a set Œî whose elements are called \\"types\\" and whose size is called the \\"rank\\". Two distinct varieties of the same type cannot be incident. A flag is a subset of X such that any two elements of the flag are incident. The Buekenhout geometry has to satisfy the following axiom: *Every flag is contained in a flag with exactly one variety of each type. Example: X is the linear subspaces of a projective space with two subspaces incident if one is contained in the other, Œî is the set of possible dimensions of linear subspaces, and the type map takes a linear subspace to its dimension. A flag in this case is a chain of subspaces, and each flag is contained in a so-called complete flag. If F is a flag, the residue of F consists of all elements of X that are not in F but are incident with all elements of F. The residue of a flag forms a Buekenhout geometry in the obvious way, whose type are the types of X that are not types of F. A geometry is said to have some property residually if every residue of rank at least 2 has the property. In particular a geometry is called residually connected if every residue of rank at least 2 is connected (for the incidence relation). Diagrams The diagram of a Buekenhout geometry has a point for each type, and two points x, y are connected with a line labeled to indicate what sort of geometry the rank 2 residues of type {x,y} have as follows. *If the rank 2 residue is a digon, meaning any variety of type x is incident with every variety of type y, then the line from x to y is omitted. (This is the most common case.) *If the rank 2 residue is a projective plane, then the line from x to y is not labelled. This is the next most common case. *If the rank 2 residue is a more complicated geometry, the line is labelled by some symbol, which tends to vary from author to author.

This was the first inauguration to be held on the building's west side. This was the 49th inauguration and marked the commencement of the first term of Ronald Reagan as President and of George H. W.

Associate Justice Potter Stewart administered the vice-presidential oath to Bush. At of age on Inauguration Day, Reagan was the oldest person to assume the presidency until Donald Trump in 2017. While the inauguration was taking place, the 52 Americans being held hostage in Iran were released. Inaugural Committee The 1981 Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, the group responsible for the planning and execution of the inauguration, was composed of: *Senator Mark Hatfield (R-OR), Chairman *Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. (R-TN) *Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) *Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI) *Representative John J. Rhodes (R-AZ) *Representative Robert H. Michel (R-IL) *Representative Thomas P. O‚ÄôNeill Jr. (D-MA) *Representative Jim Wright (D-TX) It was this committee that made the decision to move the inauguration to the West Front of the Capitol from the East Portico, where it had been held, with few exceptions, since 1837. Decided upon in June 1980, the move was made in part to save money, since the West Front terraces could be used as an inaugural platform, eliminating the need to build one from scratch. Additionally, using the side of the building facing the National Mall would provide more space for spectators. Ronald Reagan wore a stroller for daytime, and white tie for the inaugural ball. Inaugural address and release of hostages Reagan delivers his address Reagan's inaugural address was 2,452 words long. It utilized the vista offered by the West Front, invoking the symbolism of the presidential memorials and Arlington National Cemetery in the distance. As Reagan was giving his address, the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for 444 days were released. The Reverend Donn Moomaw, pastor of the Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, where Reagan and his wife, Nancy, worshipped, gave the invocation and benediction at the ceremony, and said: \\"We thank you, oh God, for the release of our hostages.\\" But his prayer came before the hostages left Tehran. President Reagan was about to have lunch with congressional leaders in Statuary Hall in the Capitol after the inauguration ceremony when he was informed that the plane carrying the hostages had left Iranian airspace. During the luncheon, he broke the news saying: \\"With thanks to Almighty God, I have been given a tag line, the get-off line, that everyone wants for the end of a toast or a speech, or anything else. Some 30 minutes ago, the planes bearing our prisoners left Iranian air space, and they're now free of Iran.\\" It is quite possible that the hostages left Tehran right before the ceremony started. The press held off on the announcement because it was next to impossible to discuss this development and the unfolding ceremony at the same time. The Reagans in the inaugural paradeThroughout Washington and throughout the country, there were celebrations to mark the inauguration and the release of the hostages. For the only time, the National Christmas tree on the ellipse near the White House was lighted on an Inauguration Day, and it was done to mark the release of the hostages. There were signs saying \\"444 DAYS!\\" as part of the celebrations. People wrapped the country in yellow ribbons, plastered freedom messages on billboards, and started preparations for welcoming the freed hostages home. The yellow-ribbon became a symbol of the solidarity of Americans with the hostages. The Statue of Liberty in New York harbor was bathed in light, the Empire State building lit in red, white, and blue, and the Boston Fire Department sounded gongs to hail deliverance of the hostages.

Three of the five traditionally recognized houses of Zen are commonly believed to have developed out of his lineage: the Caodong/S≈çt≈ç, Yunmen/Unmon, and Fayan/H≈çgen. There is scant information about his life. He is said to have lived in the Quiet Abode Temple on Mount Qingyuan. The Transmission of the Lamp claims he was Huineng's foremost student, although this was written during the Song Dynasty over 200 years after Qingyuan's death. In fact, in the oldest version of the Platform Sutra found among the Dunhuang manuscripts, which dates to about 850 CE, Qingyuan is not listed as a student of Huineng at all. The earliest source of information about Qingyuan comes from the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall, which was completed in 952 by the monk Wendeng. The scholar Albert Welter suggests that Wendeng may have invented Qingyuan in order to legitimize Shitou Xiqian, Qingyuan's supposed student, and in turn himself since he was descended from Shitou. Shitou's original teacher, Huineng, died when Shitou was only 13, so Qingyuan was necessary for him to receive legitimate dharma transmission. Biographical legends As with most Tang Dynasty Zen monks, there are many vivid stories about Qingyuan's encounters with students and other teachers. They are almost certainly not historical events, however. The Transmission of the Lamp, for example, recounts the following: > When Shenhui of Ho Chen came to study with Qingyuan, the master asked where > he was coming from, and Shenhui said from Cao Xi. \\"What's new in Cao Xi?\\" > asked Qingyuan. When Shenhui remained silent, Qingyuan said, \\"Tiles and > pebbles are still in your way\\". Shenhui asked, \\"Do you have true gold to > give to others?\\" Qingyuan said, \\"Even if I had some, how would you hold on > to it?\\" Another from the same source takes place as follows: > Once a monk asked, \\"What is the main teaching of Buddhism?\\" Qingyuan > replied, \\"What is the price of rice in Luling?\\" References Chan patriarchs 660 births 740 deaths Tang dynasty Buddhists ","title":"Qingyuan Xingsi"},{"id":"21204057","text":"The inauguration of Jimmy Carter as the 39th President of the United States was held on Thursday, January 20, 1977, at the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington D.C. This was the 48th inauguration and marked the commencement of the only term of both Jimmy Carter as President and Walter Mondale as Vice President. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger administered the presidential oath of office to Carter, and Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill administered the vice-presidential oath of office to Mondale. This was the last inauguration held on the East Portico of the Capitol building. Exactly forty years later, Carter attended the inauguration of Donald Trump, becoming the first U.S. president to mark the 40th anniversary of his inauguration. Inaugural ceremonies Carter took the Oath with a Family Bible, opened to Micah 6:8 and also the same Bible used by George Washington at his 1789 inauguration. The Bible that originally belonged to Washington was at the time in the possession of St. John's Mason Lodge No. 1. The weather was cold, but sunny, with a wind chill factor in the teens. The estimated noon time temperature was at about 28 degrees, but the cold did not stop many excited spectators from catching a glimpse of the new president being sworn into office. Carter ended the Oath with the famous words, \\"so help me God\\" Carter's inaugural address was 1,228 words long. In it, he spoke of bringing \\"a new spirit\\" among us all\\", and urged Americans to \\"reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity\\". He also expressed his desire that someday \\"the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace, built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values\\". Following the swearing-in ceremony, Carter became the first president to walk from the Capitol to the White House in the post-ceremony parade. Carter also requested that the traditional Inaugural luncheon, an event hosted by the Joint Congressional Inaugural Committee, be canceled. Coverage of the event was provided by CBS and the ceremony was televised throughout the United States. Carter popularized the ILY sign when he signaled it to a group of Deaf people. Prior to this, the ILY was an obscure sign only used among a specific Deaf community in the Midwestern United States. Today, it has become an international signal in both Deaf and hearing culture, informally meaning \\"I Love You.\\" The Carter Inauguration was the first following the opening of the Metro system and, in part because the inaugural committee paid to make the system free all day, it set a single day ridership record of 68,023 riders, a record that would last until the system was expanded the following July. Music Songs performed at Carter's inauguration included Willie Nelson's \\"Crazy,\\" sung by Linda Ronstadt; Irving Berlin's \\"God Bless America,\\" sung by Aretha Franklin; \\"Take Care of This House\\" from the Broadway musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue by Leonard Bernstein and Alan Jay Lerner, performed by Frederica von Stade and the National Symphony Orchestra; and \\"Bess, You Is My Woman Now\\" from George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (lyrics by DuBose Heyward), sung by Donnie Ray Albert and Clamma Dale.

There are also eastern white pines, but a few were selectively logged around 1900. The largest tree is an eastern hemlock, diameter at breast height and tall. The old-growth forest once lay on the boundary of two lumber companies, the Goodyear and Lackawanna, but was apparently spared because of a dispute over a surveying error. Forrest Dutlinger was a forester for the state of Pennsylvania from 1909 to 1959, beginning his career at a time of massive clear cutting of forests without any reforestation by the timber companies. Major fires were widespread and common due to most machinery being steam driven; the fires used to boil the water would ignite the surrounding area. Dutlinger also watched helplessly as the Asian chestnut blight killed all the American Chestnut trees in a matter of years.

Johnson, whom Nixon replaced in the White House since January 1969, died of a heart attack at the age of 64, two days after Nixon's second inauguration. Johnson thus became the sixth president who died during his immediate successor's administration, following George Washington (1799), James K. Polk (1849), Andrew Johnson (1875), Chester A.

Many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral. Johnson's casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol, entering through the Senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state, and exiting through the House wing; this was due to construction on the East Front steps.

He is a legendary figure in Bengal, with stories told of his yogic powers and longevity. According to some accounts, Trailanga Swami lived to be 70 years old, residing at Varanasi between 1737 and 1887. He is regarded by devotees as an incarnation of Shiva. Sri Ramakrishna referred to him as \\"The walking Shiva of Varanasi\\".  Early life  Trailanga was born in Kumbilapuram (now known as Kumili of Puspatirega Tehisil) at Vizianagaram District in Andhra Pradesh, with the name of Shivarama. His biographers and his disciples differ on his birth date and the period of his longevity. According to one disciple biographer, Sivarama was born in 1529, while according to another biographer it was 1607. His biography has been written by Biruduraju Ramaraju as one volume of his six volume project ƒÄndhra y≈çgulu. Sivarama's parents were Narashingha Rao and Vidyavati Devi, who were devotees of Shiva. After the death of his father in 1647, at the age of 40, he gave up wealth and family responsibilities to his half brother Sridhar. His mother then shared with him the fact that her father at the time of death expressed desire to be born to her and continue his Kali sadhana for the benefit of mankind. She told Sivarama that she believed that he was her father (his own grandfather) reincarnated and that he should take up Kali sadhana. Upon the initiation of a Kali mantra from his mother, Sivarama carried out Kali sadhana in the nearby Kali temple and Punya Kshetras, but was never far away from his mother. After his mother's death in 1669, he saved her ashes (chita bhasma). He would wear her ashes and continue his Kali sadhana day and night (teevra sadhana). During that time, Sivarama lived the life of a recluse in a cottage, built by his half-brother, near a cremation ground. After 20 years of spiritual practice (sadhana), he met his preceptor swami, Bhagirathananda Saraswati, in 1679 from the Punjab. Bhagirathananda initiated Shivaram into monastic vows (sannyasa) and named him Swami Ganapati Saraswati in 1685. Ganapati reportedly led a life of severe austerities and went on a pilgrimage, reaching Prayag in 1733, before finally settling in Varanasi in 1737.  Varanasi  Varanasi in 1922, where the Swami spent a considerable part of his life A member of the Dashanami order, Sivarama became known as Trailanga Swami after he settled in Varanasi, living the monastic life. In Varanasi, till his death in 1887, he lived at different places including Assi Ghat, the Vedavyas Asharama at Hanuman Ghat, Dashashwamedh Ghat. He was often found roaming the streets or the ghats, stark naked and \\"carefree as a child\\". He was reportedly seen swimming or floating on the river Ganges for hours. He talked very little and at times not at all. A number of people became attracted to him upon hearing of his yogic powers to ameliorate their sufferings. During his stay in Varanasi, several prominent contemporary Bengalis known as saints met and described him, including Lokenath Brahmachari, Benimadhava Brahmachari, Bhagaban Ganguly, Ramakrishna,Gupta, chapter 7. Vivekananda, Mahendranath Gupta, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Swami Abhedananda., Bhaskarananda, Vishuddhananda, and Vijaykrishna. and Sadhak Bamakhepa . After seeing Trailanga, Ramakrishna said, \\"I saw that the universal Lord Himself was using his body as a vehicle for manifestation. He was in an exalted state of knowledge. There was no body- consciousness in him. Sand there became so hot in the sun that no one could set foot on it. But he lay comfortably on it.\\" Ramakrishna also stated that Trailanga was a real paramahansa (lit:\\"Supreme swan\\", used as an honorific for a spiritual teacher) and that \\"all Benares was illuminated by his stay there.\\" Trailanga had taken the vow of non-seeking (ayachaka)‚Äîremaining satisfied with whatever he received. In the later stage of his life, as his fame spread, crowds of pilgrims visited him. During his last days, he took up living like a python (ajagaravritti) in which he sat still without any movement, and devotees poured water (abhisheka) on him from early morning till noon, looking upon him as a living incarnation of Shiva.  Death  Trailanga died on Monday evening, December 26, 1887. His body was given salilasamadhi in the Ganges, according to the funeral customs of the monks of the Dashanami sect, in the presence of mourning devotees standing on the ghats.  Legends and stories  There are many stories told about Trailanga and his spiritual powers, such that he has become a near mythical figure in India. Robert Arnett writes that his miracles are \\"well documented\\" and \\"he displayed miraculous powers that cannot be dismissed as myth\\" and that there were living witnesses to his \\"amazing feats\\". Trailanga was believed to have lived to be around 300 years, and was a larger-than-life figure, reportedly weighing over , though he seldom ate. One account said that he could \\"read people‚Äôs minds like books.\\" On many occasions, Trailanga was seen to drink deadly poisons with no ill effect. In one instance, a skeptic wanted to expose him as a fraud. The monk was accustomed to breaking his long fasts with buckets of clabbered milk, so the skeptic brought him a bucket of calcium-lime mixture used for whitewashing walls instead. The monk drank the entire bucket with no ill effect‚Äîinstead, the skeptic fell to the ground writhing in pain. The monk broke his usual silence to explain the law of karma, of cause and effect. According to another story, Trailanga often walked around without any clothes, much like the naga (or \\"sky-clad\\", naked) sadhus. The Varanasi police were scandalized by his behaviour, and had him locked in a jail cell. He was soon seen on the prison roof, in all his \\"sky-clad\\" glory. The police put him back into his locked cell, only to see him appear again on the jail roof. They soon gave up, and let him again walk the streets of Varanasi. Thousands of people reportedly saw him levitating in a sitting position on the surface of the river Ganges for days at a time. He would also apparently disappear under the waves for long periods, and reappear unharmed. Sivananda Saraswati attributed some of his miracles to the siddhi or yogic power Bhutajaya ‚Äì conquest over the five elements: \\"Fire will not burn such a Yogi. Water will not drown him.\\" With respect to his reportedly yogic powers, miracles abound in Trailanga's biographies and exceptionally long life, Medhasananda writes that according to the \\"science of yoga\\", attainment of these is not \\"impossible\\". It is also said that Trailanga is same as Kuzhandaiananda Swamigal of south India who has Samadhis at Madurai, Tenkasi and Batalagundu.  Teachings  Trailanga's teachings are still extant and available in a biography by Umacharan Mukhopadhyay, one of his disciples. Trailanga described bondage as \\"attachment to the world\\" and liberation as \\"renunciation of the world and absorption in God.\\" He further said that after attaining the state of desirelessness, \\"this world is transformed into heaven\\" and one can be liberated from samsara (the Hindu belief that life is a cycle of birth and death) through \\"spiritual knowledge\\". According to Trailanga, that attachment to the \\"evanescent\\" world is \\"our chronic disease\\" and the medicine is \\"detachment\\". Trailanga described man's senses as his enemy and his controlled senses as his friend. His description of a poor person as one who is \\"very greedy\\" and regarded one who always remains content as rich. He said that the greatest place of pilgrimage is \\"Our own pure mind\\" and instructs people to follow the \\"Vedantic truth from the Guru.\\" He described a sadhu as one who is free from attachment and delusion. One who has transcended the egoself.

She was a pioneering performance artist who is said to have laid the foundations and paved the way for the punk movement. Early life and career Gert was born as Gertrud Valesca Samosch in Berlin to a Jewish family. She was the eldest daughter of manufacturer Theodor Samosch and Augusta Rosenthal.Untitled review in Dance Research Journal, vol. 18, no. 2, Winter 1986/87, pp. 70‚Äì73.

In 1915, she studied acting with Maria Moissi, and dance with Rita Sacchetto.Valeska Gert, Je suis une sorci√®re: kal√©idoscope d'une vie dans√©e (Editions Complexe 2004): 259. World War I had a negative effect on her father's finances, forcing her to rely on herself far more than other bourgeois daughters typically might. As World War I raged, Gert joined a Berliner dance group and created revolutionary satirical dance. Following engagements at the Deutsches Theater and the Trib√ºne in Berlin, Gert was invited to perform in expressionist plays in Dadaist mixed media art nights. Her performances in Oskar Kokoschka's Hiob (1918), Ernst Toller's Transformation (1919), and Frank Wedekind's Franziska earned her popularity.Twentieth-Century Theatre: A sourcebook, ed. Richard Drain, pp. 34‚Äì34. Routledge 1995, In the 1920s, Gert premiered one of her more provocative works, titled \\"Pause\\". Performed in between reels at Berlin cinemas, it was intended to draw attention to inactivity, silence, serenity, and stillness amid all the movement and chaos in modern life. She came onstage and literally just stood there. \\"It was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema and stand there and do nothing,\\" said Wolfgang Mueller. Gert began acting at the Munich Kammerspiele. Also in the 1920s, Gert's other progressive performances included dancing a traffic accident, boxing, or dying. She was revolutionary and radical and never ceased to simultaneously shock and fascinate her audiences. When she danced an orgasm in Berlin in 1922, the audience called the police.Profile, goethe.de; accessed 15 June 2014. During this time, she also performed in the Schall und Rauch cabaret.Berlin Cabaret by Peter Jelavich, pp. 184ff. Harvard University Press 1996, During this time, Gert launched a tour of her own dances, with titles like Dance in Orange, Boxing, Circus, Japanese Grotesque, Death, and Whore. She also contributed articles for magazines like Die Weltb√ºhne (The World Stage) and the Berliner Tageszeitung (Berline Daily News). By 1923, Gert focused her work more on film acting than live performance, performing with Andrews Engelmann, Arnold Korff, and others. She performed in G.W. Pabst's Joyless Street in 1925, Diary of a Lost Girl in 1929, and The Threepenny Opera in 1931. In the late 1920s, she returned to the stage with pieces emphasizing Tont√§nze (Sound Dances), which explored the relationship between movement and sound. Gert could be by turns grotesque, intense, mocking, pathetic or furious, performing with an anarchic intensity and artistic fearlessness which also recommended her to the Dadaists. Valeska Gert analysed the limits of societal conventions and then expressed with her body the insights that she gained from her analyses.  Exile  = London = In 1933, Gert's Jewish heritage resulted in her being banned from the German stage. Her exile from Germany sent her to London for some time, where she worked both in theatre and film. In London, she worked on the experimental short film Pett and Pott, which long stood as her last movie. While in London, she wed an English writer, Robin Hay Anderson,Biodata, imdb.com; accessed 15 June 2014. her second marriage. =United States= In 1938, she emigrated to the United States, where she was cared for by a Jewish refugee community. She found work washing dishes and posing as a nude model. This same year, she hired the 17-year-old Georg Kreisler as a rehearsal pianist to continue focus on cabaret work. By 1941, she had opened the Beggar Bar in New York. It was a cabaret/restaurant that was filled with mismatched furniture. Julian Beck, Judith Malina, and Jackson Pollock worked for her.Mel Gordon, lecture, July 9, 2007, San Francisco, California Tennessee Williams also worked for her for a short time as a busboy, but was fired for refusing to pool his tips. Gert commented that his work was \\"so sloppy\\".Leverich, Lyle. The Unknown Tennessee Williams, W. W. Norton & Company, 1995.. By 1944, Gert had relocated to Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she opened Valeska's. Here, she reunited with Tennessee Williams. She told him stories of hiring a 70-year-old midget named Mademoiselle Pumpernickel who became jealous whenever Gert went onstage. During this period, she was called to Provincetown court for throwing garbage out of her window and failing to pay a dance partner. She called upon Williams as a character witness, which he did with pleasure, despite her having fired him. He told incredulous friends that he \\"simply liked her\\". =Return to Europe= In 1947 she returned to Europe. After stays in Paris and Zurich, in 1949 she went to Blockaded Berlin, where she opened the cabaret Hexenk√ºche (Witch's Kitchen) in 1948. Following Hexenk√ºche, she opened Ziegenstall (Goat Shed) on the island of Sylt. In the 1960s, she made her comeback in film. In 1965, she had a role in Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits, the success of which caused her to market herself to young German directors in the 1970s. During this period, she played in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's TV series Eight Hours Don't Make a Day and in Volker Schl√∂ndorff's 1976 movie Coup de Gr√¢ce. Grave of Honour by the city of Berlin In 1978, Werner Herzog invited her to play the real estate broker Knock in his remake of Murnau's classic film Nosferatu. The contract was signed March 1 but she died just two weeks later before filming began. On 18 March 1978 neighbors and friends in Kampen, Germany, reported she had not been seen for four days. When her door was forced in the presence of police she was found dead. She is believed to have died on 16 March. She was 86 years old. In 2010, the art of Valeska Gert was presented at the Berlin Museum for Contemporary Art Hamburger Bahnhof, in the exhibition Pause. Bewegte Fragmente (Pause. Fragments in motion). The curators Wolfgang M√ºller from the art punk band Die T√∂dliche Doris (The Deadly Doris) and art historian An Paenhuysen included a video Baby showing Gert performing.

It is called the eastern tree hole mosquito due to its predilection towards breeding in stagnant water that is found in natural holding containers such as tree holes . It is native to the eastern United States and southern Canada and favors hardwood habitats. It has been found as far south as the Florida Keys, as far west as Idaho and Utah, and as far north as Quebec and Ontario. This species has not yet been found in Europe, but it has the potential to spread through international trade. In 2004, it was found in a shipment of tires travelling from Louisiana to France, but it was identified and targeted with insecticides that truncated its spread. It is a known vector of La Crosse encephalitis and canine heartworm disease. In the laboratory, it has been found to vector several other viruses including yellow fever, eastern encephalitis, Venezuelan encephalitis, and western encephalitis. Because of its potential for international spread and its proclivity for transmitting disease, monitoring the distribution of this species is essential. Description =Larvae= The antennae of these larvae are half the length of the head and are smooth. The antenna setae 1-A are single. Head hair 5 is typically single, and head hair 6 is generally double. Comb scales on the abdomen are in a single irregular row with each comb having a blunt spine evenly fringed with short spinules. The saddle on the anal segment is incomplete, generally extending only three-quarters around the anal segment. The siphonal tuft has two branches. The ventral brush has six pairs of setae, and the dorsal anal gills are longer than the ventral anal gills. =Adults= O. triseriatus has a dark scaled proboscis that is unbanded, dark palps, dark and narrow wing scales, and dark unbanded legs. The vertex has white scales.One of the most notable characteristics of this species is the scutum that has a median brown stripe of scales with silver white scales on the lateral sides. Both postspiracular and prespiracular setae are present. Life cycle O. triseriatus has a holometabolous life cycle. Mating typically occurs in June and July, and females must take a blood meal prior to copulation to mature a batch of eggs. The eggs are oviposited by the female mosquito into stagnant water containers, such as tree holes and oftentimes unnatural containers like tires, and these eggs will fully embryonate after a few days. After being inundated with water, the eggs are stimulated to hatch from a lack of oxygen, and this typically occurs after a rainfall. There are four larval instars, and at the end of the 4th instar, the larvae will pupate. Adult mosquitoes will emerge between July and September in the United States . The life cycle of O. triseriatus is closely related to temperature and humidity, and this mosquito is very resistant to lower temperatures, allowing for successful diapause throughout the winter in the southern United States . In northern areas, only the eggs will survive the winter, but in more southern areas, overwintering eggs and diapausing larvae can coexist. Additionally, not all eggs will hatch simultaneously because of the unpredictable nature of water levels during the summer months. Intermittent droughts and rainfall put an environmental pressure on mosquito eggs. In response, O. triseriatus will stagger egg hatching to counteract the selective pressure of irregular rainfall . Diet and hosts The overall diet of this mosquito includes mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Main hosts for this mosquito are the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), the gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), and the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger). Only female mosquitoes take a blood meal to produce eggs, and they are typically aggressive human biters. Mosquitoes feed mainly at dusk and dawn, but they will bite during the day in wooded areas. La Crosse encephalitis La Crosse virus (LACV) is part of the California serogroup bunyavirus and is transmitted by O. triseriatus. La Crosse virus causes La Crosse encephalitis and can be very serious among children (majority under the age of 16) in the United States. It was first isolated from a 4-year-old child‚Äôs brain in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Approximately 80-100 cases are reported to the CDC every year, but this can be grossly underreported. Other studies have suggested there may be up to 300,000 human infections a year with more than 1,000 being asymptomatic. LACV is difficult to distinguish between other central nervous system viral infections, and viral-specific IgM antibodies in the cerebral spinal fluid are used for differentiation. Unfortunately, these antibody levels could also remain elevated for more than nine months in over half the patients. This disease is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. This mosquito maintains the disease in the population through transovaial transmission (passed through mother to offspring), transstadial (across life stages), venereal (between mates), and it is amplified in smaller mammals through horizontal transmission (passed to hosts). The virus can overwinter in diapausing mosquito eggs and reemerge the following spring. Prevention and control O. triseriatus, along with many other Aedes species, prefers water containers for breeding. This can be natural containers like tree holes, but they can also be found breeding in man-made containers. To control and prevent these mosquitoes from biting and transmitting disease, appropriate source reduction is necessary. A simple and cost-effective way to target mosquito breeding sites is to gain community involvement in eliminating standing water in each individual‚Äôs backyard. This can be done by turning over temporary containers that hold water, covering containers that will permanently hold water, and removing trash (like bottle caps, bowls, toys, etc.) from the backyard. It can be difficult to remove important breeding spots like plant pots and bird baths, so community outreach and public education is essential to inform individuals on the effective way to manage breeding sites that will interrupt the mosquito development cycle. Other methods to take precaution against mosquitoes that are seeking humans for a blood meal are available. To prevent mosquito bites and the potential for disease transmission, insect repellents containing DEET, Picaridin, IR3535, Oil of lemon eucalyptus, Para-menthane-diol, and 2-undecanone can be utilized. Furthermore, by wearing long-sleeves and long pants in addition to assuring proper screening at home, the prevention of mosquito bites can be maintained. Various mosquito traps can be used for the surveillance and control of O. triseriatus and other container-breeding Aedes species. Oviposition cups can be used to collect mosquito eggs. These cups are black plastic cups that are lined with seed germination paper or construction paper. Female mosquitoes will lay their eggs on the water line inside these cups, and the eggs will adhere to the paper. The paper can then be removed and taken to a laboratory for hatching, testing, or sampling. BG-Sentinel traps are traps that can be baited with CO2 and additional lures that target olfactory cues. Mosquitoes will be attracted to these lures, since they imitate the odors of the hosts they need for blood-feeding. Furthermore, CDC light traps use a battery-operated light source, CO2, and a fan that will attract and capture Aedes species effectively.

Roosevelt as the 32nd President of the United States was held on Saturday, March 4, 1933, at the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. This was the 37th inauguration marked the commencement of the first term of Franklin D. Roosevelt as President and John Nance Garner as Vice President. It was the last inauguration to be held on the constitutionally prescribed date of March 4; the 20th Amendment, ratified earlier that year, moved Inauguration Day to January 20. As a result, Roosevelt's first term in office was shorter than a normal term (as was Garner's) by days. This was also the last time the vice president took the oath of office on the Senate chamber. The inauguration took place in the wake of Democrat Roosevelt's landslide victory over Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover in the 1932 presidential election. With the nation at its peak of the Great Depression, Roosevelt's inaugural speech was awaited with great anticipation. Broadcast nationwide on several radio networks, the speech was heard by tens of millions of Americans, and set the stage for Roosevelt's urgent efforts to respond to the crisis.\\"Radio as the Significant Context of FDR's Rhetoric\\" Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes administering the presidential oath of office. Roosevelt wore a morning coat and striped trousers for the inauguration, and took the oath with his hand on his family Bible, open to I Corinthians 13. Published in 1686 in Dutch, it remains the oldest Bible ever used in an inaugural ceremony, as well as the only one not in English, and was originally used by Roosevelt for his 1929 and 1931 inaugurations as Governor of New York, and later his three subsequent presidential inaugurations until his death in 1945. Roosevelt proceeded to deliver his 1,883-word, 20 minute-long inaugural address, best known for his famously pointed reference to \\"fear itself\\" (paraphrasing Thoreau) in one of its first lines: > So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have > to fear is...fear itself ‚Äî nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which > paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour > of our national life a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with > that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential > to victory. And I am convinced that you will again give that support to > leadership in these critical days. Addressing himself to the causes of the economic crisis and its moral dimensions, Roosevelt placed blame squarely on the greed and shortsightedness of bankers and businessmen, as seen in the following excerpts: Hoover and Roosevelt on Inauguration Day, 1933. Roosevelt then turned, in the following excerpts, to the daunting issue of unemployment, which had reached a staggering 25 percent when he assumed office: After touching briefly on foreign relations ‚Äî \\"the policy of the good neighbor ‚Äî the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others\\" ‚Äî Roosevelt turned again to the economic crisis, assuring his countrymen that he would act swiftly and with determination: Rhetorical aspects After the inaugural address, a woman by the name Sarah Love said \\"Any man who can talk like that in times like these is worthy of every ounce of support a true American has.\\" Love's quote is reflective of the popular sentiment felt for Roosevelt's dynamic, confident, and inspiring oratory. Close aide Raymond Moley was responsible for crafting the speech, as he did many of Roosevelt's speeches. The idea of likening Roosevelt's coming task to commanding a war effort originated from Moley. Inaugural ball Roosevelt's wife Eleanor wore a light blue dress designed by Sally Milgrim to the inaugural ball. The dress was afterwards displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. Aftermath The day after his inauguration, Roosevelt assembled a special session of Congress to declare a four-day bank holiday, and on March 9 signed the Emergency Banking Act, which provided a mechanism for reopening. He continued on for what became his First Hundred Days of the New Deal. References See also *Causes of the Great Depression *Great Contraction *Presidency of Franklin D.

He founded Rushlight: The Belfast Magazine in 1972. Joe Graham was born in Belfast, the eighth of twelve children born to Jim and Kitty Graham. He was raised in what was then the newly built Ballymurphy housing estate in the west of the city. He attended St. John‚Äôs Public Elementary School and later St. Thomas's Secondary Intermediate School. One of his teachers was Michael McLaverty, who himself wrote stories (Call My Brother Back) about the political troubles in Belfast. MacLaverty encouraged Graham to express himself in the written word, prompting Graham to write a number of short plays which were staged and performed locally in his own community. Graham's interest in writing and politics deepened. Graham's father, Jim, would take his son on bike rides and excursions across the length and breadth of County Antrim to ensure that Joe developed a clear knowledge of many of the historical events that occurred there ‚Äì particularly the 1798 rebellion in which the Graham family played a prominent role: Watty Graham, an ancestor, was executed by the British in 1798. Rushlight On one excursion when Joe was only 12 years old, he and his father visited a graveyard situated in Mallusk, close to Templepatrick. At the back of the graveyard Joe looked at a tall monument erected to the memory of the famed James Hope. Right beside his grave was that of his son, Luke. Inscribed on Luke Hope‚Äôs grave was a word that caught the 12-year-old Joe‚Äôs eye ‚Äì the word was \\"Rushlight\\". Luke Hope published his \\"Rushlight\\" on 3 December 1825, from Clark & Hope‚Äôs General Printing Office in High Street, in Belfast. It received the name Rushlight after a form of candle. However, the paper went out of print after 41 editions and Luke Hope died a young man. In 1967, at the age of 23, Joe Graham became the editor of The Pike, an Irish republican news sheet. Activism His involvement in The Pike gave Graham the opportunity to publish his views on such issues as the Special Powers Act and share his opinion with the local community. His interest in civil rights motivated his presence in Duke Street, Derry, on 5 October 1968 and on 4 January 1969 at the Burntollet Ambush, where marchers, many of whom were members of a student body named \\"The People‚Äôs Democracy\\", were physically assaulted by loyalists. In 1969, he became a founding member of the Belfast & District Civil Rights Group,The Provisional IRA by Patrick Bishop, Eamonn Mallie (1987)The Ardoyne Citizen's Action Committee and The Belfast Housing Action Committee. These groups were established to address the need for the provision and improvement of housing in Catholic areas. Graham later established news sheets aimed at Irish republican activists in Ardoyne (The Ardoyne Freedom Fighter), Ballymurphy (Scale), and in the Falls Road area of Clonard (The Vindicator). Rushlight Gets Printed In 1972, Graham, the man published Rushlight - The Belfast Magazine for the first time. He shared the stories his father had originally shared with him as a boy as well as his own historical research and study. The magazine included articles of local interest, folklore, and tales of old Belfast. The Rushlight proved to be a staple part of Belfast literature with copies being forwarded by locals to relatives around the world, as well as copies being held in the Linen Hall Library Catalog, as well as at the Queen's University Library Catalogue, both in Belfast. In May 2002, Joe Graham was awarded the \\"Irish Hand\\" for his \\"continued and appreciated contribution of Rushlight Magazine to the Irish communities in Belfast, Brompton, Canada, and around the world\\".

His compositions include the so-called Motorbike Concerto for trombone and orchestra and his choral setting of Es ist ein Ros entsprungen. Career Born in Vilhelmina, V√§sterbotten County, Sandstr√∂m grew up in Stockholm. He studied at the Lule√• University of Technology's Pite√• School of Music (1974‚Äì1976) and completed his music training at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm, studying music theory (1978‚Äì1982) and composition with Gunnar Bucht, Brian Ferneyhough and P√§r Lindgren (1980‚Äì1984). He joined the faculty of the Pite√• School of Music in the 1980s and was appointed professor of composition in 1989. In 1988 to 1989 he composed his first concerto for trombone and large orchestra, which became famous as the Motorbike Concerto, revised in 2002 to a Motorbike Odyssey. In 1990 he composed Es ist ein Ros entsprungen (Det √§r en ros utsprungen), placing the familiar Praetorius setting in slow motion in an eight-part a cappella setting. In 1991 he completed Fr√•n M√∂rker till Ljus (From Darkness to Light) for reader, baritone and chamber orchestra, based on poems by Folke Isaksson, were inspired by an altarpiece from Antwerp in Gammelstad, with a focus on the Passion. The poems are partly spoken, partly sung, some accompanied by the orchestra; the tenth of 14 movements, Klarheten (Clarity), is purely orchestral. The work was recorded in 2002 with the singer of the premiere, Peter Mattei, speaker Sven Wollter and the Norrbotten Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Petter Sundkvist. In 2008 his Rekviem (Requiem) on a Swedish text by Christine Falkenland was first performed at Stockholm's Hedvig Eleonora Church. A review summarised: \\"99% P√§rt, 1% Bach\\". In 2009 his ballet The Tale of a Manor was recorded on DVD by the Royal Swedish Ballet and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jonas Dominique. In October 2013, a new choral work entitled Do what is fair was first performed in Uppsala Cathedral, as part of the Young Cathedral Voices festival. This new setting by Sandstr√∂m of a text from Deuteronomy, for four choirs and four organs, was performed by choirs from Uppsala, Trondheim, Warsaw, Cologne, Llandaff, Riga and Solothurn.
