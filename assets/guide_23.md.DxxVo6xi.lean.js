It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands at the end of a lane, in meadows near the River Trent. History The oldest fabric in the church is the lower part of the tower, which was built in the 12th century. Much of the rest of the church dates from the first half of the 14th century. By 1764 the chancel was in \\"a ruinous condition\\", and it was rebuilt and shortened. It was rebuilt again in 1890, and the aisles and south porch were rebuilt in 1912. During the 18th century the church gained a degree of notoriety because its rector, Rev W. Sweetapple, granted licences for marriage to runaway couples. Because of this it came to be regarded as \\"the Gretna Green of the Midlands\\". In 1820, Thomas Arnold, later headmaster of Rugby School, married Mary Penrose, the daughter of the rector, in the church. The church was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 January 1991. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in stone with some brick in the clerestories. The tower and porch are roofed in tiles, while the rest of the church has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a low clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in two stages separated by a string course. It has angle buttresses and a pyramidal roof. On the south side of its roof is a bellcote. In the lower stage is a west door, above which is a 12th-century lancet window. In the upper stage are two-light bell openings on all sides. The north aisle has a doorway with a pointed arch between three-light windows, one to the west and three to the east; there is a similar window on its east wall. In the north and south walls of the clerestory are three two-light windows. The chancel has a three-light window in the north wall, and two three-light windows in the south wall. The east window also has three lights, the central one of which is partly blocked with masonry. On the ridge of the east gable of the chancel is a cross. The south aisle also contains three three-light windows, and on its east wall are a blocked pointed arcade arch and a blocked doorway. In its west wall is another three-light window. The south porch has diagonal buttresses, a coped gable with a ridge cross, and an arched entrance. Its east wall contains a sundial. Built into the exterior of the wall of the south aisle is the carved effigy of a woman, holding what is thought to be a heart. It dates from the 14th century and originally lay recumbent on a tomb. =Interior= The nave is divided from the aisles by four-bay arcades. In the north wall of the chancel is a piscina, over which are remaining parts of an Easter Sepulchre. These consist of panels carved with depictions of sleeping soldiers, angels, and Christ rising from the dead. There is another piscina in the south aisle wall. Beside the south doorway are the remains of a stoup. Also on the south wall is a simple alms box bearing the inscription \\"Remember the Poor 1684\\". The middle light of the east window, partly blocked by masonry, contains a canopied niche. The windows on each side contain 14th- century stained glass. The right window has a depiction of the Virgin and Child, under which is a knight. In the left window are depictions of John the Baptist and Saint Andrew. There are more fragments of stained glass from this period in other windows. Most of the church furniture, including the pulpit and the octagonal font, dates from the 19th century. In the north aisle are tombs dating from the 14th century. Inside the tower is the broken alabaster effigy of a knight. External features A group of five headstones dated between 1735 and 1737 in the churchyard is listed Grade II.

(2014). More-than-store: Expanding the Experience of Retail Phenomenon.. EID is a human-centered design approach to interior architecture based on modern environmental psychology emphasizing human experiential needs.Newman, A., Dennis, C., & Zaman, S. (2007). Marketing images and consumers' experience in selling environments. Marketing Management Journal, 17 (1), 136-150Quartier, K., Christiaans, H., & Van Cleempoel, K. (2009). Retail Design: Lighting as an atmospheric tool, creating experience, which influence consumers' mood and behavior in commercial spaces. Proceedings of the Design Research Society Conference 2008 (pp. 216-232). Sheffield: Sheffield Hallam University. The notion of EID emphasizes the influence of the designed environments on human total experiences including sensorial, cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral experiences triggered by environmental cues. One of the key promises of EID is to offer values beyond the functional or mechanical experiences afforded by the environment.  Definition  Cognitive scholars claim that the human mind has a modular structure (against one central processor) by which her evaluate and respond to environmental triggers. This evaluation of built environment leads to the a multifacet perception of that environment that renders Sensorial Experiences, Emotional Experiences, Intellectual Experiences, Pragmatic Experiences, and Social Experiences.Schmitt, B., & Rogers, D. (2009). Handbook on Brand and Experience Management. Northampton: MA: Edward Elgar.. These five categories collectively define the experiential values of the environment. Accordingly, EID can be defined as the process of understanding and embedding experiential values in interior design to engage users in a higher level of sensing, thinking, feeling, interacting, and/or doing Abhari, M. (2014). More-than-store: Expanding the Experience of Retail Phenomenon.. The concept of experiential design, however, is not limited to interior design and can be adopted in architecture, industrial design, product design, and brand experience design.  Outcomes  Experiential design can help to improve the user's evaluation and perception of an environment in different settings such as retail store Abhari, M. (2014). More-than-store: Expanding the Experience of Retail Phenomenon.. For example, three central feelings that can be targeted by EID include pleasure, arousal, and dominance.Mehrabian, A., & Russell, J. A. (1980). An Approach to Environmental Psychology. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. These feelings are the results of a well-designed environment by practicing EID.Abhari, M., & Abhari, K. (2010). The Notion of Experiential Interior Design. International Conference on Arts, Social Sciences and Technology (iCast2010), Penang, Malaysia. Pleasure refers to the degree of happiness, arousal to the degree of excitement, and dominance to the sense of control. These emotions lead to behavioral responses such as approach (vs avoidance). Approach behavior is a positive attitude toward a place, which results in intention to stay, explore, affiliate, or interact.Mehrabian, A., & Russell, J. A. (1980). An Approach to Environmental Psychology. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press  In business literature  Business literature emphasizes the relationship between interior design and customer experience Schmitt, B. (2004). Visual Identity and Experience Dimensions in the International Luxury Hotel Industry. New York: Columbia Business School. For example, Schmitt's experiential marketing framework suggests that commercial environments should consider customers' experiential needs (functional, emotional, behavioral, social, and symbolic/lifestyle) in addition to sensorial experiences. Likewise, Abhari's Employee experience management model considers the experiential design of workspaces as a driver of employees' positive experiences. EID does not recommend a specific style of design, rather it emphasizes a design thinking process in which customers' experiential needs are prioritized. Marketing literature has demonstrated that experiential values can differentiate the offerings.Kim, J. B., Koo, Y., & Chang, D. R. (2009). ‚ÄòIntegrated Brand Experience through Sensory Branding and IMC‚Äô. Design Management Review, 20 (3), 72-81. EID helps firms providing symbolic meanings, differentiating brand, and communicating values with unique (branded) environmental experience. The values that associate with this positive experience enhance loyalty and fervent advocacy.

Stranahan, 205 U.S. 257 (1907), was a 1907 ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in a tax case in which it determined that the Isle of Pines off the southern coast of Cuba was a \\"foreign country\\" for the purposes of tariffs under the Dingley Tariff Act of 1897, even though Cuba and the United States had agreed that the legal status of that island would remain undetermined until they settled the question by treaty.. Context Under the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris that concluded the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Spain dropped its claims to Cuba. Because of a lack of clarity in the language of that treaty with respect to the Isle of Pines (now known as the Isla de Juventud or \\"isle of youth\\"), and because some business interests in the United States were promoting the annexation of the Isle of Pines, Cuba and the United States agreed in their May 1903 Treaty of Relations: Just weeks later, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay and Gonzalo de Quesada, Cuban Ambassador to the United States, signed a treaty recognizing Cuban sovereignty over Isle of Pines. The U.S. Senate withheld ratification of the Hay-Quesada Treaty until 1925, though it was supported by successive presidents and secretaries of state. The case The collector of the port of New York seized cigars that Pearcy brought to New York City from Isle of Pines, \\"where they had been produced and manufactured\\". He asserted they were subject to a tariff under the Dingley Tariff Act, which imposed duties \\"on articles imported from foreign countries\\". Pearcy brought suit, claiming that the Isle of Pines was \\"in possession of and part of the United States\\". Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote for a unanimous court. He found, citing Jones v. United States (1890), that the court needed to examine what the legislative and executive branches had determined with respect to Isle of Pines. For example, after citing evidence that \\"all the world knew that [Isle of Pines] was an integral part of Cuba\\", he asked with respect to the Treaty of Paris: \\"Has the treaty been otherwise interpreted by the political departments of this government?\\" He found no evidence that U.S. authorities had taken actions that showed they viewed the Isle of Pines as falling within the jurisdiction of the United States. After reviewing the language of various international agreements, military orders, official correspondence, and the activities of government administrators at various levels, he found that the United States had never exercised sovereignty over the Isle of Pines, that since being ceded by Spain it had been under the de facto jurisdiction of Cuba, and that it was therefore foreign territory for tariff purposes. He concluded: In 1925 the Hay-Quesada Treaty was ratified between the U.S. and Cuba, recognizing Cuban sovereignty.

A spinoff manga called Hyakka Ry≈çran: Sengoku Maidens, illustrated by Yuri Shinano, was serialized in the March 2009 issue of Dengeki Daioh and ended in the March 2011 issue, and released three volumes as of March 2012. A 12-episode anime adaptation produced by Arms aired on Chiba TV and other networks from October 2010 to December 2010. A second anime season began airing on April 5, 2013. At Anime Expo 2010, Hobby Japan announced that they are planning to release the light novels in North America in the near future. The series is loosely based on the Sengoku period or early Edo period of Japan, despite being set in the present day. Plot The series takes place in an alternate version of Japan called , in an alternate timeline where the Tokugawa shogunate remained active and has remained semi isolated from the rest of the world after their defeat by American forces in World War II. And the Americans have bases on Okinawa and southern great Japan. The story takes place at , an academy located at the base of Mount Fuji where children of military families train to become samurai warriors. The academy is in the middle of a power struggle between Yukimura Sanada and Matabei Goto of the Toyotomi faction and the powerful student council that rules the school, and Muneakira Yagyu, the owner of the Yagyu Dojo, and the mysterious Jubei Yagyu are dragged in the middle of the conflict. The series features the female warriors descended from the famous historical figures from Japan's Sengoku period and early Edo period. The character Charles d'Artagnan also comes from the same age in Europe. Characters =Main characters= ; : :The male protagonist of the series and a childhood friend of Sen, he has the ability, unknown even to him, to create Master Samurai. This power first manifested when he and the naked girl who fell from the sky kissed. He has since gained six additional Master Samurai with one of them becoming a Samurai Bride. ; : :The female protagonist of the series and Muneakira's first Master Samurai, with the contractual mark on her chest. According to Hattori, when she transforms she has a power level of five million. The transformation causes her eyes to turn amber with vertical slits, and in this state she is an honorable warrior who gives respect to those who have earned it but also appears to have a sadistic side. In her normal form, she has no memories of her former life and is obsessed with Muneakira whom she has referred to as \\"onii-chan\\" (big brother) from the very first moments of their meeting. She is airheaded, innocent, and acts very much like a child, which is reinforced by the fact that she refers to herself in third-person. Her weapon is a daish≈ç set, with an unusually colored katana. She does not need to chant a phrase in order to transform; she only transforms when she kisses Muneakira or when she experiences very strong feelings. Initially, during her transformations Muneakira would find himself bound by chains of unknown origin that were later revealed to be his powers as a General not yet being fully developed. :It's revealed that Jubei's Master Samurai state is her true self; her current personality having been created by an incomplete contract. Jubei's inner self warns Jubei that kissing Muneakira once more will complete the contract at the cost of her innocent persona. In her final battle, Jubei sacrifices herself to defeat Gisen. However, after the credits of the DVD/Blu-ray release it is shown that she returns to once again share a kiss with Muneakira. :During the second season, it's discovered that Jubei can no longer transform into a Master Samurai since the inner Jubei died as a result of her battle with Gisen. As she trains with Keiji, inner Jubei returns. Jubei is the only one of Muneakira's Master Samurai who completes the Samurai Bride contract, thus becoming a Samurai Bride. ; : :A 15-year-old first year high school student with an underdeveloped body who is the leader of the Toyotomi faction. She is Muneakira's second Master Samurai, with the mark of wisdom on her left butt cheek. Her weapons are a pair of huge battle fans capable of manipulating wind and can also use them to block enemy attacks. Initially, she has almost no control over her powers when she is in her Master Samurai state, though she improves as the series progresses. She also seems to have feelings for Muneakira. In season one her transformation phrase is \\"Fushaku Shinmyo\\", which means \\"Self-sacrificing Dedication\\". During season two, she is able to transform into a Master Samurai at will. Jubei's nickname for Yukimura is . ; : :Muneakira's childhood friend and the eldest daughter of the Tokugawa Shogunate. She seems to have feelings for Muneakira, and acts very much like a tsundere towards him. She is a self-proclaimed spoiled princess and always seeks to get her way regarding any decision she wants to make. She gets extremely jealous of any girl who tries to get close to Muneakira, and generally acts upon this jealousy by flying into a rage. Later, she reveals her true feelings to Muneakira and kisses him, thus becoming his third Master Samurai. Her weapon is a naginata decorated near the blade, and her transformation phrase is \\"Tenga Ry≈´rei\\", which means \\"Elegant Beauty\\". In the second season she is able to transform into a Master Samurai at will with no phrase required. Sen's attacks usually involve thunder or lightning. ; : :Yukimura's pet monkey. She is very fond of Jubei who can speak Monkey. She gains the ability to become human when she accidentally kisses Muneakira and becomes his Fourth Master Samurai. In human form she has long blonde hair and is partially covered in fur. She changes back into a monkey when she is tired. Despite her rivalry with Kanetsugu, she is shown to care deeply for Kanetsugu to the point of sacrificing herself to protect Kanetsugu. ; : :Kanetsugu is the self-proclaimed \\"Warrior of Love\\" and one of Yukimura's childhood friends. Yukimura humiliated her when they were both younger and Kanetsugu still carries a grudge because of it. Kanetsugu was sent by Sen's brother, Yoshihiko, to spy on Sen and Yukimura's actions. Her speech pattern is notable as she uses keigo. At one point in the series she feels that she is a liability to the dojo and decides to sneak away during the night, but ends up getting ambushed by Araki Mataemon. After he defeats her, Mataemon throws Kanetsugu into a street canal the moment Muneakira arrives looking for her. Rescuing an unconscious and critically wounded Kanetsugu, Muneakira proceeds to resuscitate her by performing CPR while crying at the thought of losing her should he fail. Muneakira's emotional state connects with Kanetsugu's dying state at a spiritual level, forming a new bond between the two of them which changes his next attempt at CPR into a contract kiss and turning Kanetsugu into Muneakira's Fifth Master Samurai. Her weapon is a decorated sledgehammer capable of knocking heavy gates and creating fissures when slammed down to the ground. Jubei's nicknames for Kanetsugu are , , and . Kanetsugu's appearance oddly resembles that of Vocaloid Hatsune Miku. Her favorite food is leek, also like Miku. ; : :Yukimura's bodyguard and loyal samurai, she wears a fundoshi. Her favored weapon is a yari but she also uses a small tant≈ç that she wears as a hair accessory. She seems to have a weakness for hot baths, as seen when she eagerly attempted to enter one as \\"punishment\\" from Hanzo. She possess a superhuman sense of smell. She later becomes Muneakira's sixth Master Samurai. In master samurai mode her weapon becomes a giant brush with a retractable spear head. Jubei's nickname for Matabei is . ; : :Sen's servant and head of the Student Council police who wears a maid's outfit and glasses. It is hinted that she has deeper feelings for Sen and is a masochist, who longs for Sen's abuses. Her weapon is a double-bladed pole that can split into two individual katana, and she can shoot a number of shuriken, kunai or any throwable material from under her skirt. Her glasses allow her to detect an individual's power level and also see through any man-made material. She later becomes Muneakira's seventh Master Samurai. In master samurai she uses a holographic display in lieu of her glasses to detect an opponents power level plus their Qi level. Her weapon is a giant scroll on her back that can split into various three-sided shurikans. =Toyotomi faction= The is a faction of the Academy dedicated to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate and bring a new era to Great Japan. Yukimura and Matabei are also members of this faction. ; ; ; =Buou Student Council= ; : :Sen's older brother, president of the Student Council, and head of the Tokugawa Shogunate. He believes that he is doing the best for his country, when in reality he is a ruthless tyrant with a tendency to use and discard people, including his own sister. Yoshihiko had a brief relationship with Charles d'Artagnan until he used her in one of his experiments to create Master Samurai by artificial means. He has also used other girls (who were, in fact, descendants of former Master Samurai) in his experiments, planning to create an army of Master Samurai since there are so few of them in existence. Realizing his feelings for d'Artagnan after she sacrifices herself to save him, he revives her by making a Master Samurai contract with her, and later teams up with Muneakira to defeat Gisen. :His other Master Samurai are able to use magic to create barriers but very little is known about them. ; : :Nicknamed , d'Artagnan is a tall blonde woman from France who transferred to Buou Academy. She met Yoshihiko while she was doing origami, and developed a romantic relationship in him. However, she was betrayed when Yoshihiko used her as a test subject to create Master Samurai by artificial means. Despite that he has done to her, she still has feelings for Yoshihiko, as seen in the anime and novels when she dies protecting Yoshihiko from falling rubble while holding an origami samurai's helmet that Yoshihiko had given her in the past. She was later revived by Yoshihiko and becomes a true Master Samurai with the contractual mark on her left hand. :d'Artagnan's powers as a Master Samurai allow her to channel different elements. However, because her Master Samurai powers were created artificially, her body suffers great strain from using her powers. Also, her aura differs from the other Master Samurai (sans Gisen), as it is violet as opposed to the standard black. She wields twin claymores as weapons, utilizing them to create elemental- powered attacks. ; =Hatamoto Student Council= The is a faction of Buou Academy's Student Council serving directly under Yoshihiko. ; ; ; ; ; =Anti- Tokugawa faction= The is a faction led by Shiro Amakusa. Their main purpose is to destroy the Tokugawa Shogunate by any means possible. ; ; : :The series' main antagonist. Gisen is a young girl sporting an eyepatch over her right eye who falls naked from the sky into Muneakira's arms, much like Jubei did. She is initially friendly and demure, but is shown to be very perverse when around Muneakira (whom she refers to as \\"Master\\"). She is continually trying to \\"tuck\\" a certain part of his body between her breasts; the reason being is that she thinks that the relationship between a general and a samurai is similar to that of a master and slave. Jubei nickname for Gisen is \\"Gittan\\", and Gisen refers to Jubei as \\"onee-sama\\" (big sister). :It is later revealed that she is a Master Samurai, with the contractual mark on her right eye. Her general is Amakusa Shir≈ç, a powerful samurai who once aspired to destroy Japan until he was killed by a group of rebels. She intends to revive him to destroy Japan once more. Her true personality is also revealed throughout the story, revealing her as a highly sadistic person who will stop at nothing to ensure her general's revival; she even attempted to take Jubei's body into her own to further the process. Her transformation phrase is \\"Inka Ry≈çran\\", which means \\"Indecent Flower Blooming Profusely\\", and her attacks usually involve ice. Gisen's right eye (colored red) can control and manipulate people's minds, and she wields a blade that can turn into a scissor-like weapon. ; ; : :A hotblooded but honorable warrior who likes to fight strong opponents which is her main motivation. She is particularly interested in fighting anyone who can wield two swords like herself. She has pink hair, wears a simple tan uniform with a pair of headphones around her neck, and also fights using a daish≈ç set. Her headphones are used to counteract her artificial ears, which hear unnecessary things, while she is in a serious battle. She possesses artificial ears due to being resurrected improperly. She is the leader of the four Dark Samurai. She was given the nickname Mucchan by Jubei. ; : :One of the four Dark Samurai, she relies upon her intellect as often as her physical strength. Although she is drawn to fighting strong opponents, she doesn't favor a true state of war as she may not be able to tell her enemies from her allies. Physically, she has long purple hair with a fair white complexion to her skin. She wears a black kimono with a simple white floral design on her right shoulder, sleeve ends, and lower portion. Due to being resurrected improperly, her eyes won't recover completely so she is able to see all sorts of things. Using her power, which is often signified by a black piece of equipment placed over her eyes, she is able to filter out the unnecessary items from her sight. ; : :A boyish girl with a foul mouth. She has orange hair tied back with a band and wears an unbuttoned shirt. Her arm bandages are revealed to be hiding artificial body parts due to a mistake during her revival. Due to this, she is less \\"human\\" than any of the other Dark Samurai and is able to be manipulated. She wields a giant cleaver in battle. She is one of the four Dark Samurai. ; : :A reserved loli type character with blue hair, fair skin who wears a black top over a white shirt, shorts, black boots and red gloves. She always has her circular shield worn on her back and wields a spear in battle. She often uses black crows and can seemingly talk to them. The flaw she possesses from her imperfect resurrection is that she always wears a black machine on her throat which is actually what speaks for her. She herself has always been pretending to talk normally. She is one of the four Dark Samurai. Her nickname is Inko- chan which was given to her by Jubei. =Other Characters= ; : :Keiji is a wandering samurai who despises men. She is a master of Qi, a master of disguise, and also wields an umbrella in battle. As a childhood friend of Kanetsugu, Keiji has taken her appearance to initially teach the girls how to use Qi. Her hatred for men led her to refuse to teach Muneakira how to use Qi. Her method of choice for long-distance transport is by motorcycle. Her nickname \\"Maedake\\" was given to her by Jubei. ; : :Kagekatsu is a samurai who trains with Keiji Maeda for the use of Qi. She is very jealous when Keiji visits Yagyu Dojo. She uses as weapons a bow and arrow. Her nickname \\"Kagenu\\" was given to her by Keiji.

This is accomplished by the proline rich anchor domain (PRAD) of PRIMA1 which anchors the tetramer of AChE into the plasma membrane of neural cells and myocytes.

They descended from the Emichones (Counts of Nahegau).  History  = First family in the 12th until 15th centuries = The family of the Raugraves were descended from a division of the Wildgraves around 1148 (heirs of the Emichones). The first Raugrave was Emich I (ca. 1128-1172), second son of the Wildgrave Emich VI and brother of Wildgrave Konrad. Perhaps on account of the rough and mountainous quality of his lordships Emich named himself Raugrave (; ; with the first part of the term \\"Rau\\" meaning \\"raw,\\" undeveloped land plus the common Germanic title -graf, with a similar connotation to Wildgrave, a ruler over a \\"wild,\\" densely wooded area). The second line originated from a first heritage division of the county in Nahegau in 1113 was that of the Counts of Veldenz. The family seat (') of the Raugraves was the Baumburg near the present-day village of Altenbamberg south of Bad M√ºnster am Stein, which was built before 1146. The sons of Raugrave Emich II divided his possessions, thus establishing the Stolzenberger and Baumburger lines. In 1253 the New Baumburg (') rose as the seat of a further line and the Stolzenberg line had died out by 1358. In the same year disagreements in arms took place about the Stolzenburg. The lords of Bolanden inherited the lands of the extinct Stolzenberg line and sold Simmern to the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1359. In 1385 the Altenbaumburg line died out and in 1457 the last member of the Neuenbaumburg line died. Most of the estate went to the Electorate of the Palatinate. =Second family in the 17th century= When the Raugrave possessions passed to the Electorate of the Palatinate, the Raugrave title was taken over by Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine who purchased the estates. In 1667 it fell to the children of the Elector's second marriage. Raugraf at wissen.de In 1658 the Elector contracted a morganatic, arguably bigamous (cf. Cuius regio, eius religio) second marriage at Frankenthal to Baroness Luise von Degenfeld. From 31 December 1667, the Elector accorded Luise the title of \\"the Raugravine\\" (Raugrafin), and the corresponding titles of Raugrave/Raugravine (Raugraf/Raugrafin), without territorial suffix, to each of her children, distinguishing them from his first, dynastic family; the Electress (n√©e Landgravine Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel, who always refused to acknowledge divorce from her husband, and her children, the future Elector Palatine Charles II and the future Duchess of Orleans, Elisabeth Charlotte. Thirteen children were born to the Elector and the Raugravine between October 1658 and April 1675, and she died in the castle of Friedrichsburg in Mannheim on 28 March 1677. On 26 February 1677, Charles I Louis invested his two elder sons by Luise von Degenfeld, the Raugraves Karl-Ludwig and Karl-Eduard, with the lordship of Stebbach in Kraichgau. A portion of this estate had belonged in fief to the von Gemmingen family since 1577 and when it came in its entirety to the Elector Palatine in 1677 under the administration of the city of Hilsbach, he transferred his rights therein to the two raugraves. Charles I died in 1680, followed by his son and heir by his first wife, Charles II, in 1685. The new Elector Palatine Philip William of Neuburg, a distant, Catholic relative, seized Stebbach upon Karl-Eduard's death in 1690. But in addition to several living daughters, Charles I still had a living son of his second marriage, Raugrave Karl-Moritz. Thanks to the protests of his maternal uncle, Baron Ferdinand von Degenfeld, the estate was deeded over to Karl-Moritz, the last raugrave, on 27 September 1695. Stebbach was again seized by the Elector Palatine upon the latter's death in 1702. A successful appeal against this act was made, this time on behalf of the two surviving daughters of Charles I and Luise von Degenfeld, the Raugravines Luise (1661-1733) and Amalia (1663-1709), the former of whom managed the estates of her brother-in-law, the renowned general, Meinhard, 3rd Duc de Schomberg, 1st Duke of Leinster. When Luise died her niece, Lady Maria von Schomberg (1692-1762), who had married her mother's cousin, Count Christopher von Degenfeld-Schonberg (1689-1762), inherited Stebbach. The estate remained henceforth among the properties of the Degenfeld-Schonberg counts, even after the town's merger with Gemmingen in 1974.  Property  The main properties of the Raugraves lie south of the Nahe in the Alsenz, south of Kirn, where the seat of the Becherbach, near Alzey, where they were seneschals of the Palatine counts, as well as in Simmern.

This article is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the British Cameroons. It falls into two essential parts: the occupation of German Kamerun by Anglo-French forces in 1915, when German Colonial stamps were issued with an overprint and surcharge; and the situation following a 1961 plebiscite, after which the former British Cameroons, today known as Ambazonia, was divided between Cameroon and Nigeria. Historical background Cameroon was a German protectorate called Kamerun on the outbreak of the First World War. It was invaded by Anglo-French forces in September 1914 and finally overrun in February 1916. The bulk of the country became the French colony of Cameroun while Great Britain claimed two western areas, adjacent to the Nigerian border. These were collectively known as British Cameroons and, following the Second World War, separately as Northern Cameroons and Southern Cameroons. The Anglo-French claims were ratified by League of Nations mandates in 1922.Rossiter & Flower, pp.314‚Äì315. British Occupation issues: 1915 British Occupation stamp, 1915, overprinted C.E.F. (Cameroons Expeditionary Force) and surcharged a halfpenny. Stamps of German Kamerun were overprinted C.E.F. (Cameroons Expeditionary Force) and surcharged with values from one halfpenny to five shillings by the British occupation forces in July 1915.Gibbons, British Commonwealth 1966, p.183. British Cameroons From about 1920, British Cameroons used stamps of Nigeria without overprint. These can be recognised only cancellation marks which show one of 15 relevant post offices. After the Second World War ended, British Cameroons was formally divided into its northern and southern constituents but both continued to use the Nigerian stamps with local cancellations. Northern and Southern Cameroons After French Cameroun became independent in January 1960, it was decided to hold plebiscites in Northern and Southern Cameroons in February 1961. Northern Cameroons opted to join Nigeria, effective from 31 May 1961, and so continued to use Nigerian stamps as before. Southern Cameroons opted to join Cameroon effective 1 October 1961. In the interval, stamps of Nigeria values one halfpenny to one pound, overprinted CAMEROONS U.K.T.T. (United Kingdom Trust Territory)Gibbons, British Commonwealth 1966, p.810. were issued. These stamps were valid in Northern and Southern Cameroons until separate existence ended.

Discovery and naming In 1980 a fossil site was discovered near Yacimiento de Fuente Amarga on the western slopes of the Pe√±a Isasa. In 1993 and 1994 ten fossiliferous blocks were recovered, containing numerous disarticulated fossil bones and bone fragments, among them those of a pterosaur. The type species Prejanopterus curvirostra was named and described in 2010 by Carolina Fuentes Vidarte and Manuel Meijide Calvo. The generic name is derived from the village of Pr√©jano and a Latinised Greek pteron, \\"wing\\". The specific name is derived from Latin curvus, \\"bent\\", and rostrum, \\"snout\\", a reference to the distinctive bend to the left which was claimed to be present in all fossils of the snout. A later study indicates that \\"there is no genuine sideways bend\\" of the snout, \\"but a slight dorsal curvature\\". The same study emended the specific name to curvirostris as the feminine curvirostra had been incorrect. The holotype, F. A. 112, consists of a fragmented snout. Another snout, specimen F. A. 185, is the paratype. Numerous other elements of the skull and the postcrania have been assigned to the species, mostly from the wing, the pelvis and the hindlimbs. A humerus or vertebrae are still lacking. The species represents the best preserved pterosaur known from Spain and the first named from the Early Cretaceous of that country. The bent snout features twenty pairs of small teeth with an oval cross-section. That the curvature is no preservation artefact, a post mortem distortion, is indicated by the fact that both known snouts show it. Remarkably, all lower jaws found are straight. The wing span was initially estimated at ; however, later studies indicate that the wing span of Prejanopterus was probably not much (if ever) in excess of . Systematics Vidarte and Calvo (2010) assigned Prejanopterus to Pterodactyloidea. Using the comparative method they established that no pterodactyloid group has obvious strong affinities to the species. In a later phylogenetic study Pereda-Suberbiola et al. (2012) recovered Prejanopterus as a pterodactylid, more precisely positioned between the genus Pterodactylus and the group Ctenochasmatoidea. Unwin (2013) saw the genus as a possible lonchodectid due to its unusual tooth socket morphology and long, low nature of the jaw.Witton, Mark P. (2013).

Sigmundskron Castle (, ) is an extensive castle and set of fortifications near Bolzano in South Tyrol. Today its ruins house the fourth mountain museum established by the South Tyrolean mountaineer, Reinhold Messner. On 9 June 2006 the MMM (Messner Mountain Museum Firmian) was opened in this fortified castle dating to the Late Middle Ages.  History  The first historical mention of the castle, under the name Formicaria (later Formigar), dates back to AD 945. In 1027 Emperor Conrad II transferred it to the Bishop of Trent. In the 12th century it was given to ministeriales, who from then on were named the Firmian family. Around 1473 the Prince of Tyrol, Duke Sigismund the Rich, bought the castle, renamed it Sigmundskron Castle and had it developed to withstand firearms. Of the old castle of Formigar there are only a few remnants left today, mostly located on the highest point of the site. Due to financial difficulties Sigmund had to pledge the castle soon afterwards. As a result the site fell increasingly into disrepair. At the end of the 18th century the castle belonged to the Count Wolkenstein, from 1807 to 1870 the counts of Sarnthein and from then until 1994 the counts of Toggenburg. In 1976, the half-ruined castle was partially restored by an innkeeper's family and opened as a restaurant. In 1996 the castle passed into the possession of the Province of Bolzano. In the spring of 2003, after much controversy, Reinhold Messner was given a licence for his long-planned mountain museum. During construction work a Neolithic grave was discovered in March 2006, in which a woman's skeletal remains were found. The age of the grave is estimated to be 6,000-7,000 years.  A symbol of the independence movement  The fortress is an important political symbol in South Tyrol. In 1957, under the leadership of Silvius Magnago, the largest protest rally in the history of South Tyrol was held here. More than 30,000 gathered in the castle to protest against the failure of the Paris Convention to protest and demand freedom for South Tyrol (\\"Freedom from Trent\\").

The expedition was initially planned as a commercial enterprise of the Russian-American Company to supply Kamchatka Peninsula and other Russian settlements in Alyaska, as well as to consolidate Russia's position in the remote possessions in the Pacific Ocean. The route of the first Russian circumnavigation Due to financial difficulties, the Russian government sponsored the party's outfit but, in return, in addition to its exploratory goals, the expedition was also meant to explore Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. The aim was to establish diplomatic and economic relations between Russia and Japan, as well as to open the Chinese market for trading Russian furs. The Chinese stage of the expedition was tied to the embassy headed by Yury Golovkin. When the expedition reached the Hawaiian Islands, the vessels were divided into two parts ‚Äì Nadezhda went to Kamchatka and Japan, while Neva headed to Kodiak Island where it spent 14 months and participated in the Russian-tlingit war. To help establishing diplomatic and economic relations between Russia and Japan, the party included a large diplomatic delegation headed by the Court Chamberlain and ambassador Nikolai Rezanov. However, Rezanov's authority was not properly formalized and distributed that led to conflicts with Krusenstern who was appointed six months earlier. From the political perspective, the expedition turned out not to be that successful since Japanese authorities did not allow the envoy entering the country, and refused to establish diplomatic relations. In 1805 Rezanov and his retinue were landed in Kamchatka, and later started to act independently. For instance, they took part in , and by that worsened relations between the states. On the contrary, all the commercial aims were fulfilled, even though it was impossible to sell furs in China with a sufficient profit sharing. Backstory Nikolay Rumyantsev, Russian statesman who sponsored the expedition. According to the historian , \\"we can only be surprised that the first voyage around the world was carried out only in the 19th century, although we had already had all the necessary prerequisites in the 18th century\\". The first project on communication with Kamchatka by sea from Kronstadt was submitted by Fedor Soimonov during the rule of Peter the Great in 1722. In relation to the second Vitus Bering's expedition, in 1732 vice admiral suggested Empress Anna to send to Kamchatka through Cape of Good Hope two frigates with an annual supply of provision. However, the decline of the Russian Navy in 1730-1760s for a long time delayed all the large-scale plans. In 1780s, the growing activity of the Great Britain, France and the United States in the North Pacific threatened Russian interests in expanding in the Far East ‚Äì particularly, the Aleutian Islands where Chukchi people defended their independence by force. At that time, territorial claims could be justified with a full and original cartographic data. However, it turned out that Russians did not describe the large part of Alaska that was present on James Cook' maps. In order to secure Russian interests in the region, in 1785‚Äì1794 Joseph Billings led the expedition to explore the Northeast Passage, in the planning and successful implementation of which the crucial role played the Russian navigator Gavril Sarychev. Departure of the expedition was significantly accelerated by the news that Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup sailed for the first voyage around the world. On December 22, 1786 Catherine the Great signed the order directing the Admiralty Board to send maritime forces of the Baltic fleet to Kamchatka through the Cape of Good Hope and Sunda Strait. The 1st rank captain headed the squadron and in April 1787 the Admiralty board sent him a letter of admonition. According to the document, Mulovsky had to describe all Kuril islands, to go around Sakhalin and then, after getting to the Nootka Island, to annex to Russia \\"all banks to the starting point of Aleksei Chirikov's discoveries\\". The Russian priority should have been \\"established\\" with the cast-iron pillars with the state emblem on them, as well as with the 1700 medals for distribution among the indigenous population. Mulovsky would not have to return across the world, his ships were to remain in the Far East and in the Russian America. In spring 1787, James Trevenen submitted to the empress his project on developing the fur trade in the Pacific. Trevenen's plan implied sending three ships from Kronshtadt to Cape Horn; two were supposed to stay in Kamchatka while the last one would deliver furs to China and to Japan. Later Trevenen was appointed by the empress as a captain of the 2nd rank in Russia. Due to the start of the Russo-Turkish and Russo-Swedish wars, circumnavigation was cancelled. Mulovsky and Trevenen died in the naval battles. Krusenstern's portrait by Johann Friedrich Weitsch, 1808 Between 1780 and 1783, merchant Grigory Shelikhov tried three times to interest the top government officials in sending merchant ships from the Baltic sea to the Russian America. By 1785 he managed to reach admiral and even the Tsesarevich Paul I. However, he was not heard and supplies were still delivered through Siberian region and the city of Okhotsk. According to some evidences, in 1791‚Äì1802 the rich merchant Thorkler from Reval carried out several round-the-world and half-round-the world expeditions on his foreign (particularly, French) ships. Among the other places, he visited Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Nootka Island, Canton and Kolkata. Judging by the correspondence between Thorkler and count Nikolay Rumyantsev, the former played a significant role in lobbying the Adam Johann von Krusenstern's expedition and in organizing his new voyage to Kolkata and Canton in 1805‚Äì1807. Thus, the archival documents, the \\"Overview of the Russian-American company\\" (1819), and periodical press of the beginning of the XIX century refute the vision established in historiography that before Krusenstern's trip no Russian ships crossed the equator. Krusenstern began to serve under the command of Mulovsky and, probably, was familiar with his plans. Later he, together with Lisyansky and Yakov Bering (grandson of the famous explorer Vitus Bering), went to the six-year expedition with the British merchant fleet. In 1793‚Äì1799 Krusenstern, Lisyansky and Bering carried out long trips to North and South America, India, and China. During one of his trips to the US, Krusenstern even met George Washington who organized a special reception for the travellers. In 1799 Krusenstern sent to statesman the project where he emphasized the importance of the new plan on supplying Russian America and on trading fur with China. Later this year, Irkutsk Governor also submitted his plan on establishing diplomatic and trading relations with Japan. However, due to the war with France, none of the projects were implemented. Plan and equipment =Krusenstern's project and the report of the Russian-American company= Nikolay Mordvinov, stored in Hermitage After his failure in 1799‚Äì1800 to interest the government in sponsoring the expedition, Krusenstern spent three years in his Estland' estate where he settled down to married life. A new opportunity to promote his project appeared during the rule of Alexander I. Krusenstern submitted his plan when the Russian government urgently needed money due to its participation in the second and the third anti-French coalitions. Not surprisingly that in 1802 founders of the committee for the formation of the fleet Alexander Vorontsov and rear admiral Pavel Chichagov objected against implementing the plan since development of the ground forces should be prioritized. The essence of the project remained the same. The Krusenstern's manuscript of 25 pages was dated January 1, 1802. It got to Nikolay Mordvinov who served as a vice-president of the Admiralty Board at the time when the project to launch the Kamchatka marine expedition was developing. Krusenstern put in the first place the Russian commercial interests, \\"from which the country was excluded out of its neglect.\\" Thus, he suggested the all-round state support for the large private enterprises to develop shipping in the Pacific, relying on ports in Northwest America and Kamchatka. That would allow reducing the positions of England and the United States in the fur trade while strengthening the Russian role on the Chinese and Japanese' markets. The goods received in the Far East would be delivered to Saint Petersburg by sea and not through Kyakhta as it was before. In a long-term perspective, that would grant the Russian Empire access to Southeast Asian and Indian markets, and even creation of the Russian East India Company. On July 26, 1802, Alexander I personally approved the project, allowing Krusenstern to implement it by his own. In Summer 1802, Minister of Commerce Nikolay Rumyantsev and Nikolai Rezanov, on behalf of the Mainboard of the Russian-American Company, submitted a very similar project, in which they referred to the notes of Krusenstern from 1799. The plan by Rumyantsev and Resanov was submitted as the \\"most genuine statement\\" on July 29, 1802. The project aimed to deliver in Russian America all the required goods, to free the citizens of the Yakutsk region from the heavy traffic, to strengthen Russian positions in the Pacific, to start trading in China. By referencing to Krusenstern, it was suggested to populate the Urup island and to start trade with Japan through the mediation of indigenous people Ainu. To finance the expedition, they requested a loan from the State borrowing bank for 250,000 rubles for eight years at 2% per annum. It was also suggested to award title to a merchant Alexander Baranov. =Travel plans and the chief of the expedition= Unknown painter. Portrait of a Nikolay Rezanov. Stored in the State Historical Museum The government approved the project suggested by the Russian-American Company (RAC). Even though Krusenstern claimed that he was immediately appointed as a \\"commander of the two ships\\", in reality, appointing a commander proved to be a much more complicated process. Yuri Lisyansky wrote to Krusenstern on April 17, 1802, that the vice-president Mordvinov inquired him about Krusenstern' personal qualities. However, the RAC's directorate first appointed an English skipper Makmeister and later Lisyansky.. Only when the count Rumyantsev interfered on August 7, 1802, Krusenstern was officially designated as the head of the first Russian circumnavigation. On August 21 Lisyansky was also recruited to the RAC. By that time, the expedition was in danger ‚Äì by July 1802 RAC was on the verge of bankruptcy and was able to sponsor only one ship. For this reason, the directorate agreed that the state would fully assert all necessary equipment and maintenance of the second vessel. Therefore, it was necessary to solve all juridical issues and to make decisions about the flag under which the expedition would be carried out. According to the Krusenstern's petition from July 3, 1803, and Rumyantsev's report on the Highest Name from October 12, 1805, the expedition used both military and commercial flags depending on the context. However, the RAC's flag was approved only after the end of the expedition and for this reason the sloop Nadezhda under the command of Krusenstern primarily used St. Andrew's flag while the Neva used the national flag. The main aims of the expedition were political: to explore the mouth of Amur river and adjacent areas to find convenient roots and ports for the Russian Pacific fleet. The second most important task was to \\"establish trading roots on the way to America and back\\", meaning transferring commercial cargo to Alaska, and on the way back establishing trading relations with Japan and Canton. For awarding Russian settlers and natives, the expedition was granted with 325 medals that were left after the emperor's coronation. Lisyansky embraced coinage of medals \\"for the elders of the North American tribes\\" with the inscription \\"Russian Unioners\\" only after the expedition returned home. In the report from February 20, 1803, for the first time the idea was expressed to \\"appoint someone to the Japanese embassy\\", which should have been headed by Rezanov. In April Rezanov wrote to Ivan Dmitriev that they gradually managed to persuade the emperor to approve the plan, which was later officially approved on June 10, 1803. At that time, relations between Krusenstern and Rezanov were neutral, and the captain even started to distribute the RAC' shares among his friend to increase the expedition' finances. The RAC's \\"instruction\\" to captain Krusenstern on May 29, 1803, stated that he was the \\"main commander\\" with the embassy mission with all the officials on his ship. The only people who were subordinated to Rezanov were company clerks reaching Canton. Before the departure, both sloops were equipped with food and all the necessities for the next two years, as well as granted with promised salaries. The crew and officers of the Nadezhda were employees of the Imperial Navy, while those who served on the Neva subordinated to the RAC. Rezanov was not a professional diplomat. He started his court service as the head of the Derzhavin's office back in the reign of Catherine II. On July 10, 1803, Rezanov received the rank of a real chamberlain of the court and the order of St. Anne, 1st degree. Before that, on June 26, he was elected as an honorary member of the Academy of Science in connection with his departure to the scientific expedition. Through connections with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he received the status of a diplomatic agent of the second rank ‚Äì Extraordinary Envoy and Minister Plenipotentiary. Judging by a data from indirect pieces of evidence, Rezanov participated in a conspiracy against Platon Zubov and Peter Ludwig von der Pahlen, from which the new emperor Alexander was trying to get rid of. The decline of Derzhavin's career also played a role in turning the Rezanov's fate. According to some of the historians, his appointment to Japan and Russian colonies in America was a type of exile, and not that honorary. Also, Rezanov received incorrectly given instructions, and for this reason, his later conflict with Krusenstern and military officers was unavoidable. According to the RAC's instruction from July 10, 1803, and the Rumyantsev's letter to Rezanov from May 28, 1803, the expedition was supposed to get to Kamchatka and Alaska, and round Cape Horn through Cape Verde and port Valpara√≠so in Chile. On the way back, ships were supposed to visit Canton, South Asian and Indian ports, to establish trading relations. Lisyansky who led Neva should have explored the Bering Strait and the North-Western way. At the very last minute on June 18, 1803, baron J. K. Odeleben submitted his project on heading the expedition to Africa to organize the resettlement of black people to the Far Eastern parts of Russia as free colonists. The plan was rejected as being \\"non-performing\\". Minister of Foreign Affairs Chancellor Alexander Vorontsov ordered the Russian embassies in England, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, France to ask local governments to help the expedition. For instance, the British consulate in St. Petersburg allowed the expedition to freely act in any of the British lands. The final plan of the journey, that was approved by the RAC's directorate, was the following: two sloops were supposed to get to Hawaiian islands through Cape Horn, where Lisyansky would lead Neva to the Russian America while Nadezhda under the command of Krusenstern would get to Japan. After spending the winter on Kamchatka or Kodiak island, the sloops were to be reunited and headed to Canton for trading furs. The return route Krusenstern could choose by himself. =Expedition and purchase of vessels= Drawing that presumably depicts Nadezhda in stormy weather Kodiak. It is still unclear why the RAC's directorate made a decision to charter expeditionary vessels abroad. Judging by a correspondence between the maritime department and Collegium of Commerce in 1800‚Äì1801, the Russian navy had about 10 vessels of the right size, not even counting cargo ships. Moreover, in one of his letters Rezanov mentioned that ship master was ready to master vessel of any size specifically for the round-the-world voyage. However, the directorate decided to buy ships abroad and sent Lisyansky to complete the task. On September 24, 1802, Lisyansky and ship master went to Hamburg where they could not find the required vessels. Then they arrived to England where they bought two sloops: the 16-gun 450-ton \\"Leander\\" that was later renamed to Nadezhda, and the 14-gun 370-ton \\"Thames\\" that later became the Neva. Some of the expedition officers even claimed that Lisyansky conspired with the seller and embezzled the money by buying old ships for the price of new ones. Nadezhda was built around 1795 and spent some time in captivation in France. As a result, its foremast was damaged with a canister shot while the corpus had many rotten blocks. Neva was a bit better suited for a circumnavigation (it even went to India), but its rigging needed to be replaced. They decided not to do it in Kronstadt so Lisyansky would not be suspended from voyaging. As a result, the foremast and the main mast (the wood cracked, causing rotting of mast trunks and steps' core) were replaced in Brazil at the expanse of the RAC, even though in England they spent 5000 pounds for preparatory work. Krusenstern claimed that both vessels cost around 17 000 pounds, but, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the price was 25 000. In prices of 2018, it corresponds to the order 1 491 000 ‚Äì 2 193 000 pounds. According to the History of the Russian-American Company, Nadezhda cost 82 024 rubles and Neva ‚Äì 89 214. Lisyansky calculated that the common expedition budget was around 700 000 rubles, including 24 000 pounds (270 000 rubles) for both vessels. Beyond that, another 20 000 Mexican peso were allocated to maintain the retinue of the Rezanov's envoy Rezanov. The unsuitability of sloops became obvious after their arrival to Kronstadt on June 5, 1803. Judging by the notes of the Nevas navigator, correspondents between Kalinin and Rumyantsev, Rezanov, Krusenstern and the directors of the RAC among themselves, Nadezhda was in a particularly deplorable state. In a stormy weather, its carcass was constantly leaking and almost flooding. Upon arrival to Kamchatka, the authorities even started to discuss a plan to leave the vessel. =Expedition personnel= Portrait of count Fyodor Ivanovich Tolstoy, unknown painter According to the official documentation, 129 people were on board of both vessels, 84 of them served on Nadezhda. Besides officers, non-commissioned officers, and seamen, in the expedition took part: ambassador Rezanov's retinue with service personnel, RAC officers, and five Japanese returning to their homeland. Initially, officers took leave from the military and signed contracts with the RAC. However, time in the voyage was counted as a part of the work experience and a . Five officers and non- commissioned officers got their next ranks during the expedition. Their contracts implied only tasks that were directly related to commerce, but officers never took part in trade themselves. Krusenstern wrote that even though he was advised to hire foreign seamen, he decided to take volunteers from Russia for whom he procured a salary in 120 rubles. There was also a semi-anecdotal case: Tatar sailor Abdul Abuzarov, while being already recruited to the team, later married Estonian girl just four months before the departure, and, according to Krusenstern, \\"fell into deep thoughtfulness\\". In the end, the directorate decided to leave him in Russia. In the description of the trip, both Krusenstern and Lisyansky listed all the members of their teams by names. Most of the officers and passengers were very young, the oldest crew members were 42-year old doctor and 39-year old Rezanov By the time of the expedition, Krusenstern turned 33 years old. The youngest crew members were 13 and 15-year old cadets and Otto von Kotzebue who got accepted because of the request of their father whose wife was a cousin of Krusenstern. who got a 13-years of combat experience participated in naval battles with Fyodor Ushakov, was appointed as a first assistant. Lieutenant Levenstern also had experience in the fighting, as did the captain, who had six years of service in the British Navy. Lieutenant Romberg served under the command of Krusenstern on the frigate \\"Narva\\". Michman Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen proved to be an excellent cartographer and was promoted to a lieutenant. The ambassador's retinue also included random people, in particular, Count Fedor Tolstoy. On the Neva there were hieromonk Gideon (Fedotov) from the Alexander Nevsky Lavra and clerk Nikolai Korobitsyn from the RAC, who were included in the retinue of the ambassador. Korobitsyn was to watch for Lisyansky and to give him money for any ship related costs, including salaries to officers. This did not anyhow related to the maritime charter. Both commanders differed in their way of communicating with the crews. For instance, Krusenstern thought that the team needs to be treated softly, and for that, he was criticized by Levenstern. Lisyansky, on the contrary, introduced severe discipline on the Neva and actively used corporal punishment. Priest Gideon even spoke unsightly about him since Lisyansky neglected the faith and even banned worships on the ship and michman Berh, and that, probably, led to his resignation after their arrival. In addition, Lisyansky often violated instruction of the \\"Admiralty college\\" and acted separately from Nadezhda. Lieutenants Ratmanov and Romberg were not alien to culture, knew the French language and even corresponded with Nikolay Karamzin. When playing music in the mess, Romberg was the first violin in the ship's orchestra, while Ratmanov was reading books on travels and on philosophy even during shifts, and got annoyed if others distracted him. Johann Caspar Horner \\"Lithography of Engelman\\" Even though the RAC did not have any scientific aims, Krusenstern addressed the Russian Academy of Science (where he was elected as a corresponding member on April 25, 1803) and created the \\"scientific committee\\". Based on the recommendation of Austrian astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach, the directorate hired Swiss musician Johann Caspar Horner who played the flute brilliantly, and had a desperate courage: in order to deliver Chinese skull to famous phrenologist Franz Joseph Gall, he stole the head of the executed in Macau. Botanist and zoologist Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau was the main painter of the expedition. Even though von Tilenau called himself a dilettant, he probably attended Adam Friedrich Oeser' classes in Leipzig. Doctor of medicine Georg von Langsdorff, after finding out about the expedition, went to Copenhagen personally and asked Krusenstern and Rezanov to accept him in the crew. He landed with Rezanov in Kamchatka and headed to Russian America. Karl Espenberg was a doctor on the Nadezhda, before that he graduated from the University of Jena, and later served as a family doctor in Krusenstern's family starting from 1797. Doctor on the Neva Moritz Laband was originally from Silesia and probably of Jewish origin; he graduated from the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. The expedition had a problem with ethnocultural and language barriers. Of all officers on the Nadezhda, only Ratmanov and were of Russian origin, while from the ambassador's retinue ‚Äì Rezanov, count Tolstoy, merchant , doctor Brinkin and painter Kurlyandov. Others were ethnic Germans with different linguistic dialects. For instance, Langsdorf was from Swabia; Tilesius from Thuringia; Horner from Switzerland; Robberg from Grand Duchy of Finland; Krusenstern, Levenstern, Espenberg, Bellingshausen, Kotzebue ‚Äì Baltic Germans. At the beginning of the voyage, scientists did not know Russian, while not every officer and members of the retinue knew German. According to the Levenstern' diaries, German \\"dominated the messes\\"; if necessary, the crew could switch to English or French; communication with the team was in Russian. Judging by his diary, Levenstern \\"sometimes didn't even notice what language was he using.\\" For instance, he could write German or English words in Cyrillic or the Russian ones in Latin. Botanist Brinkin (whose second name was written in German as \\"Brincken\\", but merchant Shemelin called him \\"Brykin\\") graduated from the medical-surgery academy and knew Latin so well that he even tried to pursue naturalist in the crew to communicate on it. However, Langsdorf and Tilezious did not accept him to their company. They also did not get along between themselves because Tilezious always tried to subdue Langsdorf. =Living conditions= Due to significant congestion of commercial cargos and people, the expedition vessels were largely deprived of freshwater storages and provisions. The crews consumed crackers and corned beef, the quality of which Krusenstern explicitly emphasized and even provided the names of the supplier, on a daily dietary basis. Moreover, they ate sauerkraut and cranberry juice as a matter of protection against scurvy. Uniforms, linen and beddings designed for different latitudes were made in England. Generally, living conditions were quite extreme: even officers and members of the retinue had such small cabins that they could use them only for sleeping. The only places where people could conduct research, draw maps or write diaries were the messes. On Nadezhda around twenty people constantly socialized in there, while on Neva ‚Äì only ten. Even two senior officials Krusenstern and Rezanov huddled in captain's' cabins which were around 6 m2 with no basic household amenities: no heating, ventilation or a good lighting. For the 84 people, there were only 3 latrines. According to the diaries of lieutenant Levenstern, one of the RAC's clerk even had to settle in one of the cargo boxes instead of a cabin. The constant shortage of freshwater made washing very difficult. In addition, the crews had to keep animals (including a cow with a calf) and birds for replenishing the diet. Pigs were once washed in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Under these conditions, members of the embassy retinue, who did not have any regular occupations, mired in conflicts and gambling. On the contrary, all the officers had the hardest time since they had to keep watches and make weather observations. Besides, their duties also implied writing travel journals, supervising and training the crews. Observations could take a minimum of three hours per day, and one hour for filling the journal up. Overall, the lieutenants had three shifts ‚Äì two 3 hour day shifts, and a 4-hour night shift. As a result, many experienced nervous breakdowns. For instance, while staying on the island Nuku-Hiva, artist Kurlyandov grabbed an axe and smashed his entire cabin, not even sparing the icons. =Scientific equipment= Map of the geographical discoveries made by Russian sailors, Pacific explorers, and James Cook, 1787 According to historian Elena Govor, participants of the first Russian circumnavigation thought of themselves as heirs of James Cook and Lap√©rouse. Lieutenant Romberg compared the trip from Falmouth to Tenerife with the Laperouse's voyage from Brest to Madeira. Ratmanov expressed similar thoughts right after their arrival to Santa Catarina Island and explicitly mentioned that they anchored at the French parking lot. On Kamchatka, Ratmanov installed a new tombstone to Cook's comrade-in-arms Charles Clerke, whose burial place was initially identified by Lap√©rouse. Lisyansky's companions even visited Kealakekua Bay, where James Cook was killed. The Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences provided instructions for scientists taking part in the expedition. For example, Vasily Severgin compiled specific manual for studying minerals and \\"Theory of the Earth\\" that was published in 1804 in the \\"\\". Scientist compiled instructions on botany, while academician worked on set of instructions on zoology. Sevastyanov's instruction identified four geographical regions that present a special interest from the natural history point of view, including geographies of Japan and Kamchatka. He also mentioned a status and a role of a scientist in commercial enterprise, providing the examples of Carl Peter Thunberg and father and son Johann Reinhold Forster and George Foster. In total, Sevastyanov provided 14 basic procedures for conducting observations including an obligatory indication of the exact date of sample conducting and their classifications according to binomial nomenclature. He also mentioned a necessity to sketch the appearances and to conserve conducted samples for subsequent transfer to the Imperial Cabinet of the Russian Empire. However, Langsdorf ignored the last point, and the majority of the collected samples got to the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Besides, on June 13, 1803, Commerce Minister Count Rumyantsev suggested to Krusenstern finding and exploring Hashima Island allegedly seen by Dutch and Spanish sailors. To define geographic coordinates, Krusenstern and astronomer Horner constantly checked Chronometer watch. They also tried to fix the meteorological data regularly, but, taking into consideration the situation on the ship and general lack of scientific aims, they did not conduct night observations; and could have taken breaks from conducting data for a day or more. Moreover, ship rolling changed chronometer data significantly and later in Japan, the apparatus broke. Temperature on Nadezhda was measured in R√©aumur scale, on Neva ‚Äì in Fahrenheit. According to Yuly Shokalsky 's assessment, it was the first time during the expedition when vertical assessments of deep- ocean temperatures were measured. Measurements were carried out via the so- called \\"Galsov's machine\\" which was practically just a primitive bathometer in the form of a copper cylinder with valves, inside of which there was a mercury thermometer. Systematic observations were only possible on the time of stop in Nagasaki from October 11, 1804, to April 17, 1805. Krusenstern personally measured temperature, pressure, humidity, atmospheric transparency, direction, strength and duration of the wind, thunderstorms, clouds, fogs, dew and other meteorological phenomena at 8 am, 4 pm and 8 pm. Nadezhda had a library with personal book collections of officers and scientists. The basis was the Krusenstern's book collection that is now stored in the . All books that were on the voyage (around 48) have Krusenstern's note \\"Nadezhda, 1803‚Äì1806\\". Besides atlases and maps (15 different authors including James Cook, Louis Antoine de Bougainville, Aaron Arrowsmith, and others), nautical plans, works on astronomy and mathematics, descriptions of travels that worked as sailing directions. Krusenstern thought that Antoine Fran√ßois Pr√©vost 's publication \\"M√©moires et aventures d 'un homme de qualit√© qui s'est retir√© du monde\\" was so important that later he even passed it to Kotzebue, thus the book travelled around the world twice. Expedition =From Kronstadt to Brazil (August - December 1803) = Baltic sea Expedition vessels arrived in Kronstadt on June 5, 1803. Krusenstern immediately examined them and concluded that on the Nadezhda the entire rigging and two masts need to be replaced: while loading, the ship almost turned over. Thanks to port captain Myasoedov and his assistant Bychinsky, all necessary repairs had been carried out within the shortest time possible. Only on July 06, the expedition went to the Kronstadt raid where the emperor Alexander I observed both vessels from his personal sloop. However, due to nasty winds and a constantly increasing amount of cargos, the departure was significantly delayed. On August 2, Minister Rumyantsev visited both vessels and ordered to get rid of any unnecessary cargos during the later stop in Copenhagen. Moreover, five people from Rezanov's retinue were suspended from travel On the same day, sailman Zahar Usov fell overboard and drowned in the Neva river. The expedition departed at 10 am on August 7. But then wind direction changed again, and both sloops had to cruise around Gotland until August 10, and passed Revel only late at night. Due to extreme convergence of people, the commander had to set up the schedule for shifts, and norms of provision. People were allowed to receive a pound of beef and a pound of crackers per day, as well as a cup of vodka (for those who did not drink, there was a premium of 9 cents per cup) and a pound of oil per week. For each meal, there was only one main dish. For lunch ‚Äì shchi with corned beef, made from the sour cabbage, or fish. During the holidays, the crews usually got some fresh meat. For dinner both crews usually got porridge with butter. On half-past five on August 17, the expedition reached Copenhagen where the vessels had to be reloaded: take on board the scientistic team and load some French cognac (\\"Burdov vodka\\") for the Russian-American company. Due to satisfactory barometric readings, the sloops were ready for a squall on August 19: the crews lowered the yards and topmasts in advance. However, after the vessels reached the port on August 20, they had to stay there for a long time because almost all the provision had to be replaced: all crackers and corned beef needed to be re-dry, re-pour and re-pack in the new barrels. Sour cabbage was almost fully spoiled. The whole process of re-settling accompanied with intense correspondence with St. Petersburg. The long stay in the Danish capital led to the first conflicts between Krusenstern and Rezanov. According to diaries by Levenstern and Ratmanov, the ambassador and his court advisor Fosse regularly attended brothels without taking away their regales and orders. Count Tolstoy even got an \\"illness which is characteristic for his age\\". From August 21 to September 4, a reconciliation of ship chronometers was carried out at the Copenhagen Observatory. Only at 5 pm on September 08, the vessels went to the sea again. However, a storm from the northwest kept the sloops in Helsing√∏r for the next six days. During the three-week stay, both crews daily consumed fresh meat and green, as well as two pints of beer that generally cost 400 piastres (Mexican dollars), at the rate of 1 ruble 90 kopecks per piastre. =The UK and Canary Islands= Internal raid and embankment of Falmouth, 2011 Due to intense storms nearby Skagerrak, the sloops parted, and weather stabilized only by September 20. Fishing on Dogger Bank turned out to be unsuccessful; thus, Kruzenshtern decided to test the \\"Galsov's machine\\" (bathometer). However, the sea depth was only 24 fathoms and a difference between the water temperature at the surface and at the bottom was negligible. On September 23, Krusenstern met the English vessel \\"Lavergin\\" the commander of which Beresdorf was his longtime colleague. Beresdorf took Rezanov and astronomer Horner on board to deliver them to London where they had some businesses. That allowed to save some time, plus, Krusenstern sent his nephew Bistrom ashore since his health suddenly worsened. In London Rezanov and his companion met count Semyon Vorontsov, went sightseeing, and then returned to Nadezhda through the cities of Bath and Bristol. On September 27, Nadezhda reached Falmouth where the Neva was waiting for her for two days. It was decided to stock up on Irish corned beef, out of fear that the one delivered from Hamburg could not stand even a year's journey. Both vessels heavily leaked; thus Krusenstern hired eight caulkers, who worked for six days. Also, they had to deliver fresh water from more than 4 miles away. According to Korobitsyn' calculations, both supplies and water cost around 1170 piastres. Additionally, Nevas upper deck was caulked, and rotten boards on the tank were replaced. For that, Lisyansky was issued with other 1,159 piastres. Nevertheless, lower decks and holds of both of the ships were damp, condensation accumulated even in the messes. To prevent it, even in good weather, the crews opened hatches and ventilated the premises. In addition, they filled the braziers with burning coals, as well as used vinegar and burning sulfur. Twice a week, the crews washed the with fresh seawater and pumped out stagnant water with bilge pumps. After getting to the sea, Lisyansky insisted that sailors get washed twice a week, and every incoming shift in tropical latitudes was necessarily poured by the sea water. The departure was late only because Rezanov was not returning from London. He went on board on October 5, and at the very same day the vessels headed to the Canary Islands. A rapid transition to subtropical climate was very noticeable ‚Äì on October 8 the temperature increased to 14 ¬∞R (17,5 ¬∞C). On October 10 the crews observed a significant bolide in the constellation of Sagittarius. Because the sea was calm on October 13, Horner and Langsdorf carried out oceanographic measurements and lowered the bathometer to 95 fathoms. On October 19 they reached Tenerife where they met French privateer that was passing by between Nadezhda and Neva. The vessels followed the raid Santa Cruz de Tenerife at 11 am on October 20; because of the rocky bottom of the sea, the Neva lost verp and two cable length. Since acquiring the necessary supplies was complicated, the expedition stayed in Tenerife until October 27. The crews bought fresh vegetables and fruits, potatoes and pumpkins, as well as four buttles of Canarian wine. In total, it cost 1200 piastres. During that time, Rezanov stayed with merchant Armstrong, and Horner stayed with the governor of the island, taking chronometers and observational instruments with him. The observatory was placed in the tower of the Palace of the Inquisition. Then astronomer together with Levenstern and Bellingshausen filmed the Santa Cruz harbor. The filming was completed by October 22. Almost all the crew members were struck by the poverty of the local population, by the \\"highest degree of debauchery\\", as well as by the dominance of the Spanish Inquisition. Due to constant theft, the commanders even had to prohibit local citizens to visit the ships. Before the departure, Rezanov openly named himself the head of the expedition, and that led to the first open conflict between him and Krusenstern. Later Ratmanov wrote in his diary that at that time, Rezanov apologized and acknowledged that officers would not accept orders from a chamberlain. Later ambassador wrote a complaint to the name of the emperor, about which count Fyodor Tolstoy reported to Krusenstern. The latter started to talk to officers one-by-one about his authority on the ship. Equator Marine invertebrates. Engravings from the atlas that describes Krusenstern's expedition After the farewell visit of the Spanish governor at noon on October 27, the sloops headed to islands of Cape Verde. After entering the ocean, the rank and file of those who serve were divided into three shifts of 15 people each, and this order was maintained even in the worst weather conditions. Out of fear of getting into a calm zone, vessels passed archipelago on November 6 at a distance of 25‚Äì28 miles from the island Santo Ant√£o. After entering equatorial waters, the crews stretched awnings on the quarterdecks, and the sailors were forbidden to sleep outdoors. Then the weather was foggy and hot, there was no sun for several days in a row, and the temperature could reach 22-23 ¬∞R (27,5‚Äî28,7 ¬∞C). Thus, it was impossible to dry beds and clothes. In such days, Krusenstern used to order to heat the living quarters, to feed the crews with potatoes and pumpkins, to serve half of a Canarian wine bottle a day in addition to water, and to grant people with weak punch with sugar and lemon juice on the mornings. Frequent rains made it possible to collect a two-week water supply, and wash clothes and linen. The stretched awning was turned into a pool, which could be used by up to 20 people at a time. At the same time, naturalists discovered the reason for the Milky seas effect ‚Äì Langsdorf located the smallest invertebrates in a microscope and refuted the prevailing chemical theory. On November 6, Rezanov and Krusenstern went to the Neva to worship, while due to idleness, Count Tolstoy and court adviser Fosse initiated a card game. The ships crossed the equator at 22:30 on November 26 at 24¬∞ 20' west longitude. On both ships, the crews shouted \\"hurray!\\" three times. The ceremony was held the next day. Krusenstern, as one who had already crossed the equator, conducted the ceremony. The parade with an artillery salute was staged on both ships. Lisyansky ordered to prepare a soup with potatoes and pumpkins for the Neva crew, to fry ducks and to bake pudding and to grant one bottle of porter for each three people. On Nadezhda quartermaster Ivan Kurganov who \\"had excellent abilities and gift of speech\\" dressed up in Neptune and gave vodka to the crew that got \\"pretty drunk\\" afterwards. Judging by the Ratmanov's diary, ambassador Rezanov \\"came to the quarterdeck, wallowed along, raised arms and legs to the sky, constantly shouted \\"hurray!\\" to Krusenstern\\". After they reached 20¬∞ south longitude, Krusenstern searched in vain for Ascension Island, the position of which was very inconsistent. Lisyansky all the more willingly agreed to the search because it did not require deviating from the main course. It was not possible to determine the position of the island, and the sailors considered it non-existent. According to the other version, both captains perfectly knew the location of the island and searched for the archipelago Trindade and Martin Vaz. In several years after, navigator Vasily Golovnin also coordinated the search during his voyage around-the-world on the sloop \\"Kamchatka\\". =Brazil (December 1803 ‚Äî February 1804) = View on the Saint Catharina island. Engraving from the description of Laperouse voyage, 1792 Following the example of Laperouse, Krusenstern entered Brazil through the port Florian√≥polis that, compared to Rio de Janeiro, had softer climate, freshwater, cheaper food prices and cheaper tariffs. On December 21, the sloops entered the strait separating the island from the mainland and moored off at Santa Cruz fortress. The governor's residence was in 9¬æ nautical miles from the place of anchorage. Joaquim Xavier Curado warmly welcomed Rezanov, Krusenstern and Lisyansky. In addition to assigning Portuguese officials to the sloops, all the necessary preparations were made on both ships, including chopping wood since due to high humidity the Russian crew experienced difficulties with physical work. Ambassador Rezanov and his retinue stayed with the governor while Horner was allowed to set up his observatory on Atomiris island where he immediately started recording the observations. The main problem that held the expedition in Brazil for a long time was replacement work of Nevas fore and mainmast. In addition to that, from December 26, 1803, to January 22, 1804, the main grotto was also replaced. During that time, vessel was unloaded, pulled ashore, and thoroughly caulked. Rotten boards and fairleads in the sides and decks were replaced as well. Suitable mahogany was found in the island's forests, but it was very difficult to deliver it to the harbour for processing. Overall, it cost around 1300 piastres, including 1000 piastres issued to pay for the work of the Portuguese \\"mastmaker\\". At the same time, the crews were saved from the onset of gastric diseases due to the fact that instead of water they consumed tea and weak grog. During the 5-week stay, officers and scientists had a lot of opportunities to explore the surroundings and local customs. Tilesius and Friderici stayed in the private house and had to pay for it five piastres per day since their initial hotel was very bad. Levenstern, Krusenstern and Ratmanov were most outraged by slavery. Levenstern even wrote that in the governor's summer house, where the retinue was staying, instead of a guard dog there was a slave-gatekeeper \\"who must himself seek food and not go away for a minute. Killing a black does not count as a murder here.\\" Ratmanov even wrote that \\"Brazilian nature\\" disgusts him even giving into consideration that he was in town only three times. Langsdorf, who knew Portuguese language, was highly interested in everything: starting from mate consumption rates, the damage that cassava might cause to teeth, to how local indigenous people hunt and how to clean the cotton. However, he complained that due to extreme heat and humidity, most of the botanical specimens were mouldy and rotted, and ants ate all of the collected insects. Officers even went to Brazilian Carnival where they noticed that white people \\"have fun as European Catholics\\", while Blacks ‚Äì \\"as Africans\\". In Brazil, the conflict between Krusenstern and Rezanov took a new turn. The reason for that was that on December 28 Rezanov prohibited count Tolstoy to go onshore. The prohibition was later cancelled by Krusenstern. On December 29 the commander called an officers' meeting where he addressed the boundaries of the ambassador's powers for the first time. Officers assured him that they would not pay attention to \\"orders of the ambassador that does not serve the emperor, the expedition, or the Russian American company\\". Rezanov tried to command Lisyansky bypassing Krusenstern; however, no one obeyed. On December 31 officers drafted a letter to count Tolstoy to prevent him from the ambassador' attacks, and also described the situation to the emperor, deputy of the Minister for Maritime Pavel Chichagov and to Minister of Commerce Rumyantsev. After that the situation calmed down. During repair work on January 27, Krusenstern ordered to fence off the Rezanov's space in their common cabin. In addition to that, Tolstoy quarrelled with painter Kurlyandov, and they almost organized a duel. Kurlyandov complained to Krusenstern, the former reconciled them; however, it was not enough for the painter, and he went to Rezanov. The conflict between the academician of painting and the captain was resolved only seven weeks later. =Crossing the Pacific Ocean (February ‚Äì June 1804) = Cape Horn. Neva on the Easter Island Easter island and the routes of the Neva on Lisyansky's map, 1804 On February 2, 1804, all repair works were completed, and Rezanov with his retinue returned to the vessel. In his honor, the governor of Curado gave a salute of 11 salvos, to which the Russian ships also responded with salvos. However, due to strong North winds, the departure was delayed until February 4. According to the initial expedition plan, vessels had to round Cape Horn in January. Thus, Krusenstern envisioned that if the vessels split, by April 12, being at latitude 45¬∞ and longitude 85¬∞, it was supposed to head to Nuku-Hiva. However, if the split was impossible, then the expedition would have to head to Concepci√≥n and then turn to Hawaii. In addition to the strongest storms in the area of the \\"Roaring Forties\\", there was also a problem with the shortage of freshwater, which was supposed to last for four months. Because of that, starting from February 7, Krusenstern introduced strict rationing ‚Äì two caps of water per person (including water used for cooking food and making tea). Vessels approached the latitude of Cape Horn on February 25 but headed south to avoid coming too close to the coastal cliffs. On February 26, barometer significantly \\"fell\\", but for the next two days wind allowed setting topsails up and staying at high speed. Only on February 27 the Nadezhdas jib was torn apart and Nevas tacking was unfolded. Since it got much colder (for the three weeks in all the living quarters it was no more than 3 ¬∞R or 3,75 ¬∞C), the crews on both of the vessels received winter clothes. Lisyansky ordered to cook pea soup on \\"dried broth\\", and give more pumpkins and onions in addition to salted food. If the pitching allowed, people used to set fire on the lower deck. According to the reckoning, the expedition reached the Pacific Ocean on March 3. During the storm on March 25, the vessels eventually lost sight of each other. Since the closest shore was Valpara√≠so in 1000 nautical miles to the East, Lisyansky decided to head for the Easter Island. The storm on March 28-29 was so strong that Lisyansky changed his sceptic and agnostic view at the world, in his diaries he pondered about God and Providence. Starting from April 1, when the weather stabilized, a forge was installed on the Nevas deck and the crews started to forge axes, knives and nails for future exchange with the natives. On the board, there were descriptions of the island previously made by Cook, Forster and Laperouse. Neva reached the island at 1 am on April 15 on the distance of 35 nautical miles. After giving a volley to \\"clean up the guns\\", the battery was equipped with the warheads. Neva was near with volcano Katiki and Cape Roggeven. From the board, the crew could clearly see moai and cultivated plantations. However, due to fogs and heavy surf, the ship cruised off the coast for the next four days. Since anchor was impossible, on April 21, Lisyansky sent Lieutenant Povalishin with gifts for the islanders (knives, bottles, etc.) to the shore in order to leave a message for Krusenstern in case if Nadezhda enters the island. Povalishin took a navigator and four sailors with him; they were insured from the board. Clerk Korobitsyn noted that the islanders willingly gave away bananas, yams, sweet potato or sugar cane for mirrors, scissors, and especially knives. A bottle sealed with wax and a note to Krusenstern was also handed over. Povalishin managed to get a full boat of products, as well as some ethnographic objects, in particular, a patterned mat. Concluding the description of the island, Lisyansky corrected the coordinates and calculations of the number of Paschal people that were made by Cook. According to G. Barrat, Lisyansky's demographic calculations were quite correct.  The island of Nuku Hiva Tattooed warrior from the Nuku-Hiva commune. Engraving by Tilesius. Tayohae Bay on Nuku Khiva, 2006 The storm that parted Nadezhda and Neva raged until March 31 and the weather eventually stabilized by April 8. The first warm day on Nadezhda was only on April 10 and the crews used for cleaning up the artillery. Count Tolstoy organized some training, while some of the crew members sewn sails. Doctor Espenberg conducted a thorough medical examination and concluded that despite the constant lack of freshwater and a 10-week stay in a highly adverse climate, all unter-officers and sailors were healthy. Since Rezanov insisted on the soonest delivery of the RAC' cargos, Krusenstern decided to head to Nuku Hiva, bypassing Easter island directly. The blacksmith was set to forge nails, knives and axes to trade with the Polynesians. Weather was unstable ‚Äì even though on April 17 the vessel crossed tropic of Capricorn, squalls continued for the other five days. Only after that, prevailing trade winds brought the vessel back to track. Every morning and night people who were promised a reward looked forward from crosstrees and bowsprit hoping to see the islands. After a heavy storm on May 5, at the sunrise, the crew saw Fatu- Hiva, Hiva Oa and Ua Huka islands. Due to fog, the ship had to lower all sails and reached Nuku-Hiva around 5 pm. Krusenstern and his crew spent on Washington islands (that were part of the Marquesas Islands) 11 days, from 7 to 18 May 1804. They settled on the Eastern shore on April 24 (according to the Julian calendar). Krusenstern decided to use bay Anna-Maria as a base. In local languages, the bay was referred as \\"Taiohe\\". The local tribe was led by a separate leader. Krusenstern and his crew were able to contact the leader of Kiatonui (expedition members referred to it as \\"Tapega\\") thanks to Englishman Roberts, who was the leader's son-in-law. His antagonist was Frenchman Cabri, who was married to a daughter of a leader of a lower rank. The expedition struggled with the problem of where to get more fresh water and provisions. Krusenstern wrote that local tribes willingly suggested coconuts, bananas and breadfruit. The most profitable way for the crew was to sell the locals some pieces of barrel five-inch iron hoops, which were abundantly stocked for this purpose in Kronstadt. The islanders sharpened them and made blades for axes or tesla. On May 11, Neva also reached the island. Lisyansky met Krusenstern and the leader of Katonui. The crews could not obtain fresh meat because the locals had a minimal amount of pigs. After all, the teams got only four pigs and three piggies that were immediately eaten by the crews. On May 12 there was an incident: the leader of Katonui lingered at Nadezhda, and his tribe decided that he was captured, and took out their weapons. At that time sailors were conducting freshwater, and the islanders (including the leaders of low rank) tossed full barrels and carried them through the surf. To prevent incidents (taking into considerations that there were a lot of cannibals on the island), Krusenstern and Lisyansky prohibited officers, sailors and scientists to visit the island alone. They were only allowed to go ashore in organized groups that were led by officers. Botanist Brinkin never went ashore out of fear before the \\"cannibals\\". However, most members of the scientific group took the customs of the islanders for granted. Even though Europeans had previously visited Nuku Hiva, there was no epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases on the island. Krusenstern rationalized the entertainment of the crew: according to Levenstern's description, a signal \\"Women, come here!\\" used to be sent from the ship to the beach, the girls were allowed to board in order, after which \\"capable ones searched for a mate\\". In the morning, the captain counted those who departed. All the participants in the trip described Polynesian Sexual customs (meaning guest marriages and polyandry). However, Langsdorf was the one who noticed that only women of lower social status served as seafarers. Krusenstern and Ratmanov were disappointed by their appearance. However, if the combat officer noted that Polynesians are \\"ugly\\" and do not correspond to the descriptions of Bugenvil or Foster, the captain wrote that European canons of beauty differ from the Marqesian ones. Tilesius and Langsdorf met aristocrats during the excursions along the coast and noted their high growth, harmony, \\"liveliness and exquisite manners\\", as well as the use of clothing. Among other customs, people got interested in local tattoos: Marquesinas used to tattoo the whole surface of their body, including head, and only MƒÅori people has somewhat similar practices. Members of the expedition got amused by the fact that tattoo artists might copy inscriptions in any languages. Not only sailors tattooed different signs as well, but even Krusenstern tattooed the name of his wife that he \\"desperately admires of\\", on his arm. Ratmanov tattooed some French inscription a bit upper his heart and count Tolstoy also made his first tattoo exactly on the Marquesas islands. On Nuku Hiva, a sharp outbreak of conflict happened between Krusenstern and Rezanov. When Nadezhda arrived at the port Anna-Maria, Krusenstern prohibited the exchange of the RAC's axes to local rarities (pieces of jewellery or weapons) in hope to save them for buying more pigs later. The captain even read the order out loud on May 7. He used the example of George Vancouver who did the same during his expedition in Tahiti. Rezanov and merchant Shemelin violated the order, thus, on May 9 Krusenstern had to introduce free exchange again. It resulted in sharp deprecation of iron hoops, and Shemelin in his notes that were published in 1818 noted that it turned out to be impossible to buy pigs precisely because of the trade crisis caused by Rezanov. At the same time, Rezanov ordered Shemelin to exchange as many rarities as possible for Kunstkamera collection. However, the process got complicated: islanders demanded only hoops and knives. For example, on May 13 Shemelin bought a signal shell, human skull, and several folding knives. Finally, on May 14 a public argument between Rezanov and Krusenstern took place, in which Shemelin and Lisyansky also participated. According to the notes from both sides, the ambassador called captain's actions \\"childish\\" and proclaimed that buying proviant is not in his competition while collecting objects for Kunstkamera was a direct order from the emperor. Krusenstern was reprimanded, to which he replied that he does not obey to Rezanov. Officers from both of the vessels demanded Rezanov to provide public clarifications and public demonstrations of the official instructions, while Rezanov could not even name the name of his instructor (it was count Rumyantsev), and Lisyansky, judging by the notes made by Rezanov, openly said that emperor Alexander \\"can sign up pretty much everything\\". It is notable that the letter that Lisyansky sent to Krusenstern the next day, directly states: \\"Before today I considered myself in your command [as captain], but now it turns out that I have another commander\\". Ratmanov even claimed that after Rezanov's proclamation that \\"he is everything and Krusenstern is nothing\\", the ambassador could not prove his position documentary. According to a historian of the Russian navy N. Klado, Rezanov had only the highest rescript in which nothing was said about the order of submission. If it was the other way around, Krusenstern could not be so confident against senior in age and rank (chamberlain in the Table of Ranks related to the same class as a contr-admiral). On Nuku Hiva Krusenstern discovered and described an excellent harbour, which he called the port of Chichagova. It was located southwest of Taiokhae (port of Anna Maria). A flurry blew before the departure on May 17. Neva managed to leave the bay under sails, while Nadezhda squeezed to the west bank at 4 am and was threatened with death. The commander was able to save the sloop only by using verps, and by sacrificing an 18-pound verp anchor and two cable ropes. Frenchman Cabri accidentally got on board (he was staying for a night and then did not dare to swim a few miles to the coast in such stormy weather). Later he claimed that Krusenstern made him stay by force. After coming back to Europe through Kamchatka, Siberia and Petersburg, his fate was quite tragic. Trying not to aggravate any conflict, Rezanov voluntarily stayed in his half of the captain's cabin prior to arrival to Kamchatka. Shared voyage to Hawaii The route of Neva nearby Hawaii, 1804 Due to route length from the Northern part of the Pacific Ocean to Japan, vessels faced with the necessity to visit Hawaiian islands to update the stocks. Since the crew failed to get fresh meat on Nuku Hiva, Krusenstern was afraid of a possible scurvy outbreak even though no one member of the crews had any signs of the disease. Just in case Lisyansky started to hunt sharks, on May 20 he even caught a 7-foot fish. The shark meat was prepared for the Neva crew, and only the captain himself did not like the new dish. When the weather had stabilized, members of the expedition resumed oceanographic observations that Horner carried out between May 22-24 by putting the thermometer on 100 fathoms and depicting the difference in temperatures in 10 ¬∞R. On Friday 25 at 3 pm on 146¬∞ West longitude, the expedition crossed the equator again in the North direction. On May 30, Johann Neumann, who served as the personal cook of count Rezanov, died. Initially, while discussing the personnel back in Saint Petersburg, Krusenstern did not want to take him because Neumann was already ill with consumption. In his diary, Ratmanov mentioned that Rezanov forced Neumann to go. In Brazil Neumann started coughing with blood, and Krusenstern suggested to pay him 1,5-year salary, so Neumann can stay in Santa-Katharina where his health might significantly improve due to climate. However, Neumann decided to travel further, but the climate of Cape Horn completely stripped away his health. He was buried according to maritime custom. Hieromonk Gideon refused to attend the ceremony because, according to Levenstern, \\"the late one was not even a Lutheranism\\". Probably, Neumann was Jewish. On June 8 at 9 am the Hawaii island became visible (Krusenstern called it \\"Ovagi\\", and Lisyansky ‚Äì \\"Ovigi\\"), and the vessels arrived at the shore around 2 pm. Locals on boats approached the ships and started to suggest small things for exchange. Thus, for a night, both sloops moved away from the coast and drifted nearby. On June 9 the aborigines brought in a 2¬Ω-pound pig. However, both sides could not set up a deal because locals asked for clothes that the crews did not have. At the same time, a big leak opened on Nadezhda because the draft of the vessel decreased as the reserves depleted, and decayed caulking on the waterline scattered in the air. Sailors had to pump off the water once or even twice a day. Krusenstern was horrified by the fact that all Hawaiians whom he met had apparent signs of the diseases (sexually transmitted or dermatitis caused by excessive use of cava). Frenchman Cabri who wanted to board off and return to Nuku Hiva, also disdained the \\"scabby Hawaiians\\" (as described by Levenstern) and decided to continue his trip to Kamchatka. After reaching Kealakekua Bay, Krusenstern ordered Espenberg to conduct a thorough medical examination. The results showed that the vessels might travel directly to Russian possessions because stocks on board allowed it. On June 10 at 8 pm Nadezhda returned to the sea. The monument on the place where James Cook died. Kealakekua Bay, 2017 Neva remained on Hawaiian islands until June 16. After landing ashore, the crew found out that Englishman Jung led all local businesses because a local leader moved to Oahu. On June 12 both sides started the bargaining round. The crew bought two pigs and different roots in exchange for two axes and three bottles of rum. Officers and sailors actively bought various local handicrafts. Aborigines usually traded for textile, even for canvases. Aborigines claimed that Jung prohibited to sell pigs, however, despite the prohibition, Hawaiian foreman brought up two big pigs, two piggies, two goats and 10 hens, a barrel of sweet potatoes, as well as taro, coconuts and sugarcane. Lisyansky prohibited women from entering the ship. This time aborigines also willingly bought strip iron. At the evening, Lisyansky visited the place of Cooks' death, pagan church, the local leader's house, and the shipyard, where locals were completing the construction of a double canoe. Leader imposed on the Russians taboo. Thus the locals stayed away from them. Bargain continued until June 13 and June 14, then, finally, Jung arrived at the vessels ‚Äì it turned out to be that he was not notified about the Russian presence. Lisyansky did not invite him for a dinner, after that Englishman became nice, gave two big pigs to the crew and tried to make his best to make amends for his impoliteness. He brought the officers back to the place where Cook died, where he conducted a short but detailed tour for the group. On June 15 American fishers arrived to Neva and notified the commander about the battle of Sitka. On June 16 the crews managed to buy 8 pigs (4 from Jung and 4 from the Hawaiian foreman) in exchange for a canvas. After that, Lisyansky counted that there should be enough provision to make it to Alaska. On June 17 Neva anchored and headed towards the island of Maui. After visiting Kauai, on June 20 Lisyansky directly set the route to Unalaska Island. =Nadezhda on Kamchatka, Sakhalin and in Japan (July 1804 ‚Äì 1805)= Friedrich Georg Weitsch. Krusenstern's crew in Avacha Bay, stored in the National Museum, Warsaw Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Equipping the embassy to Japan Krusenstern constructed the route to Kamchatka thus it would not lag for more than 100-120 miles from the original route paved by James Cook. On June 22 the vessels crossed tropic of Cancer and got to a two-week calm, during which the surface of the ocean was mirrored, which the captain had previously observed only in the Baltic. Using the perfect weather conditions, Horner and Langsdorf started to measure the temperature at different sea levels, and to catch marine animals, particularly, jellyfish \\"Onisius\\". Following the Rumyantsev' instructions, they were also searching for a ghast island that was supposedly located to the east of Japan, and that many unsuccessfully tried to locate starting from 1610. On July 13 Kamchatka's shore became visible, and on July 14 the sloop reached Cape Povorotny. Because of the calm, the vessel arrived to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky only at 1 pm on July 15, making the transition from the island of Hawaii in 35 days. During that time, only once a person had symptoms of scurvy, he needed eight days for a full recovery. Rezanov and his retinue immediately went ashore and sent a messenger to the governor major general who was at that time in 700 miles away in the city of . The port commander Major Krupsky, who settled the ambassador in his own house, took up the arrangement. They fed the crew with fresh bread and fish every day, so the team can get back in shape after a 5-months journey from Brazil. The sloop was moored in 50 fathoms from the coast; the goods were brought to the shore while the ship itself was repaired. In his letter to the governor that was sent on the day of the arrival, Rezanov wrote directly \\"naval officers rebelled on my board\\". At the same time, he could not take any actions until the governor returned to the capital of Kamchatka on August 10 ‚Äì after 26 days of being absent. However, during the unloading of the embassy property on June 30, Rezanov could not stand it and attacked Krusenstern. Judging by the Levenstern's description, the ambassador threatened to put all officers in pads (except Golovachev), and hang them. Accusations made by Rezanov were so serious that the governor Koshelev had to give this case a go. At the same time, there was no official documentation that could prove Rezanov's version of the event. Apparently, Koshelev decided that the incident was so bad that he even called for 30 lower ranks from . The only evidence that tells about the governor position in the incident was the report on the name of that was sent on August 26 (September 7) 1804 ‚Äì the day when Nadezhda headed to Japan. Judging by the document, Kosheleved pulled away from the discussion. According to the Levenstern's diary, Major general told Rezanov that he was a witness, not a judge. In his letter to a vice-minister of Minister of Justice Nikolay Novosiltsev from June 12 (24) 1805, Krusenstern described his version of the events. Captain decided to force the situation and make Rezanov take a position for which he would be responsible. On the day of the trial where Koshelev was present, Krusenstern handed his sword to the general and demanded his departure to Petersburg. Ratmanov later stated that \\"the ambassador came to his senses and started to look for an agreement\\", persuading the captain to go to Japan, after which he will leave the sloop. Partly this happened because lieutenant claimed that if Krusenstern leaves, he will also leave the vessel. Ratmanov thought that the phrase in the Rumyantsev instruction about subordination of both vessels to Rezanov, was written by the ambassador himself. Then comes the main discrepancy: in his letter Rezanov wrote that Krusenstern apologized to him for violating the subordination on board. At the same time, Krusenstern mentioned that it was Rezanov who apologized to Krusenstern. Interpretation of evidence highly depends on the position that the researcher might take. Levenstern and Ratmanov claimed that it was Rezanov who apologized, and the officers even consulted if they would accept his apologies or not. Levenstern later noted that both sides did not have a choice because the embassy to Japan had to be taken. Thus, both officers and Krusenstern should \\"suppress all personal grudges, all quarrels, and follow the emperor's will and the aims of the expedition\\". Eventually, on August 16, the official truce took place. In his letter to the emperor, that Rezanov sent the same day, he emphasized Krusenstern's merit as a leader. However, prior to the arrival to Kamchatka, the relationship was extremely strained, even though there were no open quarrels. Before departing to Japan, count Tolstoy, botanist Brinkin and painter Kurlyandov went ashore from where they would have to travel back home by land. The main reason for that is that they became outcasts on board. Brinkin, according to Levenstern, committed suicide after returning to St. Petersburg. Kurlyandov got sick on his way home and settled down in Kazan where he taught in the Kazan Theological Seminary. The question of whether Tolstoy actually visited America, where he got his nickname, remains confusing. \\"Wild Frenchman\\" Kabri was also sent ashore. Rezanov took an \\"honour guard\\" on vacated seats: captain of the battalion of Petropavlovsk Ivan Fedorov, lieutenant Dmitry Koshelev ‚Äì brother of the governor, and eight non-commissioned and privates. They were supposed to return home after the end of the embassy mission. According to the letter of F. Romberg, the \\"honour guard\\" received urgently prepared uniforms with gold embroideries on them, while guards bear caps were originally taken from St. Petersburg. They departed on August 30. The unsuccessful embassy to Japan Nadezhda and a guard of honour. Japanese depicture, 1805. Constant light rain and fog chased the crew in Kamchatka and during their first ten days on the way to Japan. On September 11 it transformed into a massive storm. The leak on the board got more prominent, and the crew had to score four bulls that they got on Kamchatka, because the animals could not bear the pitching. The first clear day was September 24, Japan got visible on September 28. Due to a massive storm, the vessels could not get closer, and navigation by Krusenstern and Horner showed that existing maps, even including Aaron Arrowsmith's, were not reliable enough. On October 3 the sloop reached the shore of Satsuma Domain. The local government notified the governor of Nagasaki. Then, the expedition headed to , and first described it since all the existing European maps were redrawn from the Japanese ones. Nadezhda reached the Nagasaki strait around 5:30 pm on October 8. Rezanov had an \\"open list\\" from the Batavian Republic and the precept in the name of the head of the Dutch East India Company Hendrick Doof for assisting in maintaining the embassy's mission. At that time, relations with the Eastern countries were not in priority for the Russian authorities. Rezanov's instruction stated: \\"make decisions according to Japanese customs and do not abase oneself\\". The letter from the emperor Alexander I addressed the \\"Emperor of Japan\\", by which he meant Sh≈çgun. When the former embassy led by Adam Laxman arrived in Japan, local authorities allowed only one ship to stay in the bay. Under these conditions, Rezanov was supposed to conclude a trade agreement between two states, and initiate trade relations either in Nagasaki or in Hokkaido. To endear the Japanese side, it was decided to bring home the Japanese victims of ship wreckage that happened in 1794 near the Andreanof Islands. Rezanov had 50 boxes containing gifts for the Japanese authorities, in the hope to interest them in potential items to trade. Prevailingly, these were items made from glass and crystal: chandeliers, candelabras, 15 crystal and marble countertops in different colours, 71 large mirrors and 25 smaller mirrors, six porcelain sets from the Imperial Porcelain Factory, ivory vases, fur products. Later Levenstern wrote in his diary that Rezanov and Fosse wanted to sell gifts that were not accepted by the Japanese side because it was a \\"real crap\\". Lieutenant also noted that although fox furs were highly valued in Russia, in Japan they are considered to be as a kitsune or \\"unclean animal\\". The only thing that caused genuine interest from the Japanese side was the clock (English work) from the Hermitage in a shape of an elephant, that was able to turn the trunk and ears, and the kaleidoscopic lights made by Russian inventor Ivan Kulibin. Japanese prostitutes, 1805. Japanese authorities sent translators of the lowest rank to conduct negotiations, who demanded the same ceremonial as for Dutch. Krusenstern, Rezanov, merchant Shemelin depicted arguments regarding whom and how many times to bow. Levenstern drew Japanese authorities clarifying types of bowings. Japanese could not understand the reason why Russians resented, assuming that they should obey common rules and follow the example of Dutch. Storms frayed the Nadezhda, and the vessel desperately needed repair works. The crew even had to agree to disarm the ship and put the whole stock of gunpowder in the Japanese arsenal; they took all the guns and several anchors. Only after small bargaining with the local officials, the crew was allowed to keep the swords, and the honour guard ‚Äì guns. Rezanov preached self- humiliation to the crew before the Japanese authorities, but he, answering questions from the Japanese side, behaved arrogantly and aroused many suspicions. As a result, the sloop was transferred to the internal raid in Nagasaki only on November 9 ‚Äì in a month after the arrival. Due to the extreme restraint of the ambassador, only on December 17 the team was allowed to go ashore. Rezanov was provided with a house and warehouses in Megasaki (street Umegasaki), while the sloop was put for a repair works in Kibati. The ambassador's house was rounded with a bamboo fence, and more resembled a prison. Rezanov, after a year of travelling in extreme conditions when his authority was constantly disputed, did not have a desire and strength to follow Japanese and European vision on diplomatic representation. He constantly scolded his retinue, cursed with translators, and each of his steps was recorded and reported to higher authorities. There were also incidents of another kind: when women were delivered to the embassy, Rezanov complained that locals use teeth blackening. Authorities resented him, and said that \\"Russians have the same tastes as Dutch\\". Sailors on the Nadezhda found themselves in even more cramped position. They were allowed to go ashore only to the one specific spot that was \\"one hundred and forty steps\\" long, limited by a fence, and was kept under guard. There were three trees on the site; the ground was covered with sand, only the small arbour covered people from the rain. Overall, it looked like a prisoner walk. Nevertheless, Levenstern claimed that due to the fact that Japanese did not know that it is possible to make triangulation and cartography from the board, for that short period, officers on the Nadezhda were able to conduct more material than Dutch for 300 years. In these conditions, Langsdorf and Tilesius conducted research on climate and ichthyology. To do that, they convinced local fishers that daily delivered them fresh food, to provide them with new biological types every time they come. Later Langsdorf claimed that for the three months that they were in Megasaki, researchers received 400 fish specimen of 150 different origins, that he later draw and described. Also, fishers provided him with drawings of local animals. Conduction of biological specimen was quite often mentioned in the Levenstern's diary from December 6, 1804, to April 5, 1805: through suppliers or translators they were able to obtain 8 species of snails, 24 species of birds, 16 species of fish for stuffing were obtained (obtaining fresh supplies was described separately). The total weight of the fish alone for the samples was 128 Japanese catti, which corresponded to 4 pounds 32 pounds (78 kg). In January 1805 Langsdorf glued a balloon from silk and paper, which was once run on a leash, despite Rezanov's displeasure. The second launch attempt happened on February 6, and ended up with the ball being ripped off by the wind and thrown onto the roof of one of the city's houses. After that, the scientist switched to flying kites. Other news was not comforting either: of the four returned Japanese, one, Tatsuro, cut off his tongue with a kitchen knife on January 28, and tried to cut his throat. The guards managed to stop him, and the Japanese doctor completely healed the wounds, although it was already impossible to restore his voice. Even though Rezanov knew the basics of the Japanese language, he did not understand that the Japanese surrounding him were specialists ‚Äì Rangaku, that is, professional Dutch scholars, experienced, versatile specialists. Ratmanov called them \\"reasonable beasts\\". The most famous Japanese scientist that was attached to the embassy was that later wrote a book about officers and researchers on Nadezhda based on conversations with the crew and those Japanese who returned home. He highly praised the moral qualities and scientific qualifications of Langsdorf. The embassy was closely watched by another famous intellectual and artist ≈åta Nanpo. He, in particular, copied South American drawings that were made by the members of the expedition. The ill-conceived actions of the ambassador significantly complicated the course of negotiations. For instance, Rezanov even tried to fake his disease, blackmailing the governor with the anger of the Russian sovereign. He also demanded Japanese doctors although he had Tilesius and Langsdorf in his retinue who had medical degrees and large practical experience. Japanese doctors visited Rezanov on February 10, 1805, and could not find out any serious diseases. The next day the ambassador proclaimed that by doing that he wanted to demonstrate respect and trust to the Japanese side. There was also another incident: Rezanov much liked Japanese Aizu-style caskets (black and gold-plated), and he demanded 500 copies of them as a deposit before the trade starts. When the trade did not happen, he embezzled them. Finally, on April 4 and 5 Rezanov got an audience with both Nagasaki bugy≈ç and , and also a representative from Edo . The meeting did not go well; both representatives received the ambassador coldly. Despite the heavy rain, only Rezanov was invited to the tent where the representatives told him that they completely reject any type of trade relations On April 7 there was a farewell ceremony where Russian members of the crew expressed a desire to leave Japan as soon as possible. Russian gifts were not accepted, but the Japanese side did take money for the materials that were used for repairing the Russian ship ‚Äì boards, bars and 500 copper sheets ‚Äì as well as provision for the crew and the retinue. Following the order of Sh≈çgun, 5569 kg of rice, 23,7 ton of salt, and 25 boxes of silk wool were given to the crew as a gift. The Japanese side also provided Nadezhda with provision for the trip back to Kamchatka: 2457 kg of dried bread, three boxes of powder, 15 boxes of sake, salted fish, 28 –ø—É–¥–æ–≤ salted pork and live cattle. It took ten days with 16-hour working hours to load all provision on board, as well as returned weapons. Leventern accused Rezanov what he embezzled all the received things by the name of \\"RAC's property\\" and wanted to sell them in Kamchatka or Kodiak. In the end, officers gave up their part of sault to sailors, and, following the Krusenstern's order, 1228 kg of rice was given to the needed citizens of Kamchatka. Second visit to Kamchatka Lighthouse at the Cape Aniva, 2017 Despite extreme discontent of the Japanese authorities, Krusenstern decided to return the embassy in Petropavlovsk through the Sea of Japan ‚Äì along the west coast of Honshu and Hokkaido which was quite unknown to Europeans. Stormy weather prevailed after the departure. From the Got≈ç Islands Nadezhda headed North to the Tsushima Island that it passed by on April 19. Only on May 1, the vessel reached the Tsugaru strait. It headed further, primarily because Krusenstern wanted to find the strait (that was drawn on his map) dividing island Esso (Hokkaido) from Karafuto. On May 7-9 Krusenstern realized that Karafuto corresponds to Sakhalin on Russian and French maps. Then the expedition went through the La P√©rouse Strait, correcting many mistakes on the maps drawn by Lap√©rouse. On May 14 Nadezhda anchored in the Aniva Bay. In the morning of May 15, Langsdorf and Ratmanov went describing the shore, and Rezanov and Krusenstern went to local settlement to establishing contact with Ainu people. After talking with them, Krusenstern suggested that their native lands were under the constant Japanese attacks, and it would be highly desirable to establish Russian trading post right there. Ainu treated sailors with rice and fresh fish, from which they prepared pilaf. At 8 pm on May 16, the expedition rounded the Cape of Aniva, and on May 17 it arrived in the Gulf of Patience which was described by lieutenant Golovachev. On May 20 they discovered a cape which was named after Mulovsky. On May 22 they described the Cape of Soymonov. On May 24, powerful fields of perennial ice at 48 ¬∞ C blocked the path. Coming between the islands of Mussir and Raukokke, the crew discovered four more islands ‚Äì . After a massive storm, on June 1 the expedition passed the islands of Ekarma and Shiashkotan. On June 5, the crew arrived to Petropavlovsk. During their travel to Kamchatka, the crew on Nadezhda unwillingly participated in the medical experiment ‚Äì one of the honour guards got infected with a smallpox while being in Megasaki. He was initially from Kamchatka where vaccination against the disease was not mandatory. Krusenstern was not so much concerned with a potential epidemy on board (even though there was no opportunity to declare a quarantine), rather than with a possible spread of the disease in Petropavlovsk. After a short investigation, Krusenstern found out that every member of the crew (except for two sailors) who travelled from St. Petersburg, were vaccinated. Espenberg personally vaccinated them, but they did not get infected, from which it was concluded that they \\"already had a smallpox\\". Before the arrival to Petropavlovsk, all the property of the recovering soldier (including linen and bunk) was thrown into the sea, soldiers' belongings that were left in Kamchatka were treated with sulfur, and the bunks and belongings of the sailors were washed in boiling water with a bar of soap. After the arrival, infected soldat was put in a 3-week quarantine, while the crew was prohibited from communicating with the locals. By introducing these restrictions, Krusenstern referred to consequences of the smallpox epidemic in 1767. Later it was found out that Alexander I sent to Krusenstern and Rezanov the gracious rescript dated April 28, 1805. According to the document, Krusenstern was awarded an Order of Saint Anna of the 2nd degree. At the same time, Chamberlain Rezanov received a golden snuff box decorated with diamonds. Both of them received a letter from Rumyantsev in which the count proposed Rezanov to \\"investigate the American shore from the Kodiak Island to the Bering Strait.\\" Langsdorf also decided to go with the RAC's representative, because he was interested in observing the \\"natural wealth\\" of Russian America. The procession left Nadezhda ‚Äì Fosse was sent with a report to Okhotsk and then to Saint Petersburg by land. Major Friderici was left on the sloop (Levenstern and Ratmanov claimed that there were some rumours about his intimate relationship with Cadet Moritz von Kotzebue). Since Krusenstern planned to explore Sakhalin during the summer, Friderici and Shemelin were landed off in Petropavlovsk. Later they joined the crew again and travelled to Saint Petersburg through China in the fall. Study of Sakhalin. Third visit to Kamchatka Map of the Krusenstern' routes in the North-Western part of the Pacific Ocean Ship departure was scheduled for June 21; however, the governor was still on the Northside, trying to establish relations with Chukchi. Besides that, one of the boilers in the galley required repair. On June 25 Rezanov departed to the New World on the vessel Maria. On July 1, governor Koshelev arrived in Avacha Bay. Departure was significantly delayed because Krusenstern found out that Rezanov had written a lot of letters to St. Petersburg. Fearing denunciations and aiming at neutralizing possible consequences, the captain had to get the governor's support. Reaching the open sea at 4 am on July 5, Krusenstern first aimed at getting closer to the Lovushki islands, geographic coordinates of which he could not locate before due to cloudy weather. Simultaneously the crew conducted coastal surveys from the to Cape Lopatka. However, upon the arrival at the place on July 6, the sloop was again covered with a thick fog. After passing the Nadezhda Strait, they headed to the , surviving the massive storm that turned the marseille apart. Perfect weather for conducting scientific observations stabilized on July 19. Because of that, the crew was able to detect the coordinates of the Cape Gvozdev and found the Cape Bellingshausen. On July 25-29 Nadezhda was again chased with the storm; however, the crew did not know that in this place off the coast of Sakhalin there were neither large shallows nor reefs. Only on August 9, the expedition reached the Northern part of the island with the capes \\"Maria\\" and \\"Elizabeth\\". Krusenstern thought that the newly discovered northern strait is more suitable and safe harbour than Tenerife or Madeira. There they discovered a settlement of Nivkh people (\\"Chinese Tatars\\") which Levenstern, Tilesius and Horner decided to visit. However, they met a hostile reception and hastened to retire. On August 12 Nadezhda entered the channel that divided Sakhalin from the mainland. At 11 am on August 13, the coast of the Asian mainland with two mountain ranges was seen, and the width of the strait, as it seemed, did not exceed 5 miles. The water was so fresh that Krusenstern concluded that the mouth of the Amur river is somewhere nearby. As the depth quickly fell, a rowing boat was lowered down, on which lieutenant Romberg measured the bottom. The depth did not exceed 7-8 metres and rapidly decreased closer to the Asian coast. The crew discovered a new cape in the Strait of Tartary that was later called in the name of Khabarov. Due to a strong counter-current, Krusenstern decided not to take any risks and announced that Sakhalin is undoubtedly a peninsula. However, he also added that it would be useful to send the next expedition for exploring 80-100 miles of the Tatar Strait and locating the exact coordinates of the mouth of the Amur. Such expedition was carried out only in 1849 by Gennady Nevelskoy. Due to mists and storms, exploration of Sakhalin got dragged on, while Nadezhda was supposed to meet the Neva in Guangzhou. An attempt to finish describing the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka failed due to fogs. On August 30 at 3 pm, everyone safely returned to Petropavlovsk: Grave of Charles Clerke, 2009 The news was disappointing: materials and provision that were ordered from Okhotsk had not arrived yet, and only on September 2 the official transport came under the command of midshipman Steingel. It contained post (the latest letters dated on March 1), and also instructions by Rumyantsev that were delivered by the from St. Petersburg in 62 days. Nadezhda needed a complete change of rigging. Ballast and 70 cubic fathoms of firewood for the whole return trip were delivered to the ship. Provision from Okhotsk was bad: the crew took only corned beef for three months (it went bad after six weeks), and crackers for four months, but already in China, they were not even suitable for a livestock feed. Because the works got delayed, officers followed the Ratmanov's initiative and decided to renew the grave of captain Charles Clerke. On September 15 they built up a pyramid made of birch wood, painted marble, and surrounded by a balustrade and a moat. Tilesius painted the coat of arms in the Cook's travel description with an oil paint. Also on September 20, the transport from Unalashka arrived with the news from Lisyansky and a small load of furs for sale in China (400 skins of sea otters and 10,000 fur seals). The governor's brother Dmitry Koshelev delivered potato, vegetables (including beet), berries, and four bulls ( these were gifts from Kamchatka) to the ship. Finally, on Saturday, on October 5, Nadezhda was dragged to the bay and at 2 pm the vessel reached the open sea. Before the departure, the crew found out that in 1805 new changes in the merchant flag were introduced. Thus, from Kamchatka to China, Nadezhda travelled with a nine-lane frag ‚Äì tripled tricolour. These innovations did not last long. =Arrival of Neva in Russian America (August 1804 ‚Äì November 1805) = Fight for Novo-Arkhangelsk Residence of A. Baranov in Novo-Arkhangelsk The transition of Neva from Kauai to Kodiak lasted for 25 days. Generally, the trip went calm, except that the weather was rainy and the frosts began to prevail. According to Lisyansky, due to the abundance of fresh pork on board, many people started to suffer from the gastric infection. However, they were quickly cured with quinine. The vessel arrived on July 10. Already in Brazil Hieromonk Gideon had received an order from Rezanov to head the Kodial school and the organization of pastoral activities. Thus, he went ashore upon the arrival in Kodiak. He was supposed to return to Russia with the messenger, not on the Neva. After the arrival, Neva found itself in the middle of the armed conflict. On July 13 Lisyansky received a request from merchant Alexander Andreyevich Baranov to help in liberating Sitka from Tlingits. Baranov had on his side transport Ermak, 120 armed Russian hunters and industrialists, as well as 800 indigenous allied forces on 350 kayaks. The 14-gun sloop significantly strengthened the squadron. Negotiations with the head of the indigenous population of Sitka ‚Äì Sitcan toyon Kotlean ‚Äì failed because Baranov demanded to surrender the fortress and pass on reliable to Russians. On October 1, 1804, naval guns bombarded the Sitcan fortifications. However, it was not successful since guns' calibre was small, the palisade was thick, and the Indigenous peoples of the Americas took refuge in ditches or underground passages. Thus, Lisyansky landed troops with a field gun, under the command of Lieutenant P. P. Arbuzov. Baranov and Lieutenant P. A. Povalishin with four guns attacked from the other side. Even though Tlingits fired from falconets and rifles, the Russians started the assault. The attempt of frontal attack was repulsed by the Indigenous peoples ‚Äì Povalishin was injured in the chest, the podlekar Mutovkin received bullet wounds in his arm and leg, seven sailors got wounds of varying severity. Rankers Artemy Pavlov and Andrei Ivanov fell in the battle; sailor Ivan Sergeev died the next day from the received injuries. Nevertheless, the position of the Indigenous peoples was doomed. On October 2 both sides started negotiations, however, already on October 7, the main forces of the Indigenous peoples fled through the mountains. As a result of the conflict, a fortress Novo-Arkhangelsk was founded, and Russian authority in the region was extended to the Alexander Archipelago.  Wintering in Kodiak  Cult objects and weapons of the Kodiak aborigines. Engraving from the English edition of the Lisyansky's report. The winter was approaching, and on November 10, 1804, Neva returned to Kodiak to the harbour of St. Paul. By November 16 the sloop was outfitted, and the crew was transferred ashore. With the advent of cold weather, Lisyansky detected the temperature in 5,5 ¬∞F (‚àí14,7 ¬∞–°). Wintering lasted for 11 months during which the crew lived in comfortable accommodations. Moreover, sailors engaged in fishing and winter haunting. On Svyatki the crew staged a theatrical performance, and for Maslenitsa they built an ice slide. The frost lasted until March 9, 1805; the lowest measured temperature was ‚àí17.5 ¬∞ C (9 pm on January 22). Preparations for the departure started on March 20. From March 22, Lisyansky, with navigator Kalinin and one sailor went on three canoes to conduct geographic surveys. By April 12 they had compiled a map of the Kodiak archipelago, the Chiniat Gulf, the Pavlovsk harbour, and Three Hierarchs Bay. The RAC's counterman Nikolay Korobitsyn made the main decisions regarding this stage of the expedition. He was also supposed to take furs on board for trading in China. Overall, Neva delivered goods for 310,000 rubles from St. Petersburg, and received furs and walrus bones total cost of 440,000 rubles. Besides loading the goods, the crew had to make a new bowsprit for the sloop that delayed the departure until June 13. The expedition left the Pavlovsk Harbor only at 2 pm on November 16. On June 22, Neva arrived in Novo-Arkhangelsk. During the winter, eight large wooden buildings were constructed, about which Lisyansky wrote that in size and decoration they would have looked quite worthy even in Europe. Neva greeted ruler Baranov with a salute of 9 shots. He was also invited for dinner with the captain. From July 2 to 7, navigator Kalinin was on the Kruzof Island where he described the bay and the Mount Edgecumbe. Lisyansky was so interested in Edgecumbe that on July 21-22 he, together with Povalishin climbed and explored a crater that was overgrown with dense forest. While later describing the journey, the captain greatly exaggerated the height of the mountain. Transition to China After a farewell to Baranov, around 6 pm on September 1, 1805, Neva went to the open sea. To replenish people who left the ship, Lisyansky took aboard two Kodiak aboriginal kayakers and four Russian-Indian mestizo to teach them sailing. Already on September 2, the vessels got into a massive storm that later transformed into a full calm. One of the aims that Lisyansky had was finding the unknown lands located to the East of Japan. Ship rangers were unsuccessfully looking for land on the horizon, while at 10 pm on October 15, being at 26¬∞43' North latitude and 173¬∞23' West longitude, Neva stranded on corals. By throwing spare yards and rods, and guns, overboard, the crew was able to pull the sloop into deeper water. However, in the morning, a massive storm put the ship back to corals. Even though the keel got damaged, and there was a high risk of destroying the whole ship, the crew successfully dealt with this problem. They even collected all the yards, rods and guns that were previously thrown into the sea. This is how they discovered an uninhabited island that was later named after Lisyansky. Despite the intense heat, the captain went ashore and buried a bottle, with a letter about his priority to the land, into coral sand. However, the damage to the sloop was so significant that Lisyansky later regretted that he was not able to look for unknown areas any further. By October 31 the crew had only 30-days supply of dried bread left. Thus, the ratio was reduced to a quarter pound per person. Only on November 16, the crew was able to see the Tinian's extremity, and then, all the Northern Mariana Islands. On November 22, the vessel barely got through a heavy squall, that crushed the yal, that was lying on the sheep feed, into wood chips. At the same time, the main-staysail-sheet hit three sailors and threw them overboard. However, a shaft of water brought them back, and they were able to cling to the guys. The water level in the hold exceeded afoot, so the crew had to pump it out urgently. That exhausted people who were sleep and food-deprived for the whole day. On November 23, while cleaning the ship, the crew discovered the stench from the main hold. The next day they opened it and first put vitriole checkers in there, and sprinkled it with vitriol. Then the crew picked up the soaked bales with furs, while braziers heated the damp hold. Lisyansky was afraid of miasms and transferred the crew to the officers' mess before the hold will be in order again. Korobitsyn dismantled the bellows and assessed the damage from November 24 to 28. As a result, spoiled furs in the total cost of 80 000 rubles were thrown into the sea. After the incident, Korobitsyn conducted the report. =From Canton to Kronstadt (November 1805 ‚Äì August 1806) = The stay in China View of Canton, around 1800 Due to mists and snow, on October 9, Nadezhda almost ran aground while leaving the Avacha Bay. The constant swell, cold and storms complicated the further way. Yet, Krusenstern risked searching for islands that were present on old Dutch and Spanish maps, such as Rico de la Plata, Guadeloupe, Malabrigos, and others. All of these islands were later declared nonexistent. The weather had become more or less clear only on the 20th day in the sea. However, on November 17, when the sloop was passing the Taiwan Strait, there was a hard stormy night. The captain ordered to keep the sails safe by all means; however, the old ones were tearing apart with every strong gust of wind. Thus, the new sails had to be installed. During the transition to Macau, the vessel anchored around 7 pm on November 20 when it was already very dark. As a result, the British almost captured the ship as they mistook it for Spanish. The reason for that was that Nadezhda went under the new nine-line commercial flag. Krusenstern wanted to work with the director of the British East India Company's trading post in Guangzhou, J. Drummond (Drummond), whom he had known since 1798. Following the instructions of count Rumyantsev, the captain aimed to receive from him detailed information on the Qing dynasty. By that time, the trade season had already opened, and British personnel went to Guangzhou, while the personal house of the director and the premises of the company were provided to Krusenstern and officers who wanted to scatter ashore. It turned out right away that the presence of Nadezhda in the bay broke many rules regarding the stay of foreign ships in China. Krusenstern was also concerned with the fact that the Neva had not shown up yet. On December 3, Lisyansky eventually arrived, and the Russian sloops relocated to the island Huangpu island to the mouth of the Pearl river (to which officers and merchants referred to as \\"Tigris\\"). Krusenstern, according to the instructions, hoped that the Yury Golovkin 's embassy was already in Beijing, and all agreements with the Qing authorities would be implemented. In reality, the embassy had not even crossed the Chinese border, and Russian sloops caused a commotion among the Guangdong authorities and merchants. Nevertheless, manager of maritime customs (the Russians called him goppo), Yan Feng allowed him to enter the port of Canton, apparently intending to charge duty. On the contrary, Governor Wu Xionguan hesitated with granting the permission, and without it, merchants could not make deals. At the same time, the typhoon season had started, and Krusenstern and Lisyansky risked to lose another year. In this situation, the British helped, especially the firm Bil' and Moniak (in Krusenstern's transcription). Officers lived in the house of . However, the RAC's clerk Shemelin was angry at the requested amount of commission ‚Äì 5%, instead of the generally accepted 2%. Merchant barely was able to persuade the youngest member of the community Gunhan Li Yanyu (the Russians called him \\"Lukva\\") to \\"thank\\" Yan Feng. When the case moved forward, Shemelin did not want to engage in barter exchanges, but demanded cash in silver (possibly fulfilling the requirements of his company). View on the thirteen factories in Canton by William Daniell, 1805‚Äì1810 Generally, the deal did not bring the expected profit. According to Korobitsyn, they managed to sell furs in the amount of 191 621¬Ω Spanish piastres, for which tea was obtained for 80,000, silk fabrics for 20,000, porcelain for 14,000 and pearls for 3,000 piastres. In case they received 74 631¬Ω piastres, however, from them they paid commission to British, taxes, measurement tax, supplies for ministers, as well as expenses of two captains, two clerks and their servants on the shore. Krusenstern settled in the Austrian trading post (costing 800 piastres), and Lisyansky in the Armenian one (600 piastres). Shemelin claimed that for the cargo they received only 176 605 piastres. The situation was extremely unfavourable, and it was decided to bring the best fur of sea otters, foxes, arctic foxes and bears back to St. Petersburg. For the most valuable beaver skins, Chinese side gave no more than 20 piastres (100 rubles), although in Moscow they could be sold for 200-300 rubles. Probably, Krusenstern did not get into much details regarding the deal, considering it only as an annoying hindrance to his main cause. Generally, the common cargo consisted of 832 boxes of different tea sorts and 20 000 pieces of silk fabric on Nadezhda, as well as 1201 boxes of tea and unsold stocks from Alaska (355 sea otters, 2202 foxes, 1867 arctic foxes, 233 bears, 76 pounds of walrus bone) on Neva. Lisyansky used the delays in the departure to careene the Neva, and to repair the underwater skin and keel. All the repair works were carried out between December 27 and 29, 1805. A conflict between Krusenstern and Lisyansky erupted in January. As far as one can judge, Lisyansky sought to participate in the transaction and receive a captain's commission, referring to his status and the Maritime Charter. The stay of the Russian sloops in Canton almost led to a political crisis. On January 22, 1806, the governor had ordered to stop the loading of Chinese goods until he received an official response from Beijing on the arrival of the Russian ships. He even set up the guards around the sloops. Director Drummond entered the position of both Kruzenshtern and Lisyansky and contacted the goppo through Lee Yanyu. As a result, the guard was removed. He even wrote a short letter to the governor with a request to release the sloops from China. Despite all the difficulties, the decisiveness of the British and Russian side took effect: the goppo personally visited Nadezhda and met with Lisyansky (Krusenstern was absent) ‚Äì a rare case in relations between Chinese officials and foreign merchants. It seems that the governor and the customs authorities sought to get rid of the Russians as quickly as possible, so the exit documents were completed in just two days. On February 9, both sloops left Guangzhou. Already after the departure of Nadezhda and Neva Jiaqing Emperor annulled all the deals, and ordered to detent the ships. The emperor's order stated that marine trade with Russia would only damage the border trade in Kyakhta. Drummond tried to resend the copy of this order to the Russian authorities; he also sent view on the situation to Nikolay Novosiltsev. At that time, the political situation between France and Russia was uncertain ‚Äì many expected the war to start. For this reason, after leaving Huangpu, Krusenstern ordered to keep the vessels together and not to apart. In case if bad weather parted the sloops, both vessels would meet at the Saint Helena island which played the role of a rendezvous point. However, ships should not wait longer than four days. Return of the Neva Joint travelling of Nadezhda and Neva lasted until April 15, 1806. While leaving the Sunda Strait on March 5, sailor Stepan Konoplev died from the gastric disease that \\"turned him into a mummy\\". He was buried following the maritime tradition. On April 15, according to both Lisyansky and Korobitsyn, due to a \\"gloomy weather\\", the vessels parted. After that the commander of the Neva went under all sails to the Cape of Good Hope, wishing at all costs to return first. The vessel passed the Southern part of Africa at 3 pm on April 20, and on 24th it entered the zone of favorable southeast trade winds. Important events happened later this day. After counting food supplies, Lisyansky decided not to wait for Krusenstern at the Saint Helena, but to return to Saint Petersburg by his own as the provision should be enough for the three months travel. To successfully return, Lisyansky sacrificed part of his estate privileges. For instance, officers on the Neva ate fresh meat, while the lower ranks ate salted beef. Thus, only 20 chickens were left for the messes, and the crew was assigned with a new ration. Since there were no fresh herbs left, tea leaves were added to a corned beef soup. On Sundays and Thursdays the crew relied on rice porridge with molasses. On Mondays and Wednesdays ‚Äì pickles or pickled vegetables. On Tuesdays and Fridays rice porridge was cooked on a \\"dried broth\\". The norm of the water consumption was 112 buckets (approximately 12 litres) per week. At the same time, there was an English beer essence that provided a \\"healthy and pleasant drink\\". On April 26, a large conflict in the mess took place. Senior assistant lieutenant P.V. Povalishin sharply objected against the plans of the commander, which is recorded in the journal of the navigator Kalinin. He said it literally: \\"What, do you want to kill us by hunger?\\" and on that he received an answer \\"If I hear one more rude word, I will order to send you back to cabin\\". Nevertheless, in order to be able to collect rainwater and, if needed, get help from the shore, the route back to St. Petersburg was laid along the meridian of the Cape Verde Islands, and then the Azores. On June 9, near with the Corvo Island the vessel met the English military ship that delivered the news about the beginning of War of the Fourth Coalition between France and Russia. Even though Neva obtained all the necessary security certificates from the French government, the crew made all the arrangements to prepare for a potential fight. Finally, on June 26, the vessel reached the English Channel, and the met pilot bot led the sloop to Portsmouth for 50 Guineas. This record transition lasted 140 days, and was unprecedented for its time; there were no scurvy patients on board. The stay in Portsmouth lasted two weeks (June 28 ‚Äì July 13), and Lisyansky even visited London from there. From the Downs to Skagen Neva went with the squadron of Lord Keith; the Russian ambassador obtained permission. On July 21 sailor Ivan Gorbunov died ‚Äì he was previously injured in the chest during the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì1790). At the last day of sailing on August 5, with fair wind the Neva showed a record speed in 11 knots which was approximately 20, 37 kilometres per hour, and in the morning of August 6 it anchored in Kronstadt. Lisyansky was on the road for almost three years (1095 days). Altogether, he passed 45 083 marine miles (83 493 kilometres) for 532 days in the sea. 58.5 % of time and 57.2 % of the covered distance, Lisyansky acted independently. In the evening of August 6, the clerk Korobitsyn reported at the general meeting of shareholders of the Russian-American company. The next morning the directorate arrived on the Neva. On August 7, count Rumyantsev and count Stroganov also visited the vessel. On August 8, the emperor visited the sloop and had breakfast there, appreciating the quality of the sailors' food that was offered to him. On August 10, the sloop was visited by Empress and the four great princes on a boat from Peterhof. On September 5, Alexander I additionally examined the goods that were brought from China and already removed from the holds. On September 9, the auction of Chinese tea took place, where all the goods from both sloops (2095 boxes) were sold to Moscow merchants for 110 rubles per pood. On September 20, clerk Korobitsyn received , and eventually said goodbye to the sloop and its team. Captain lieutenant Lisyansky was promoted to Captain of the second rank, received Order of Saint Vladimir 3rd degree, a life pension, and a bonus of 3,000 rubles in silver. From the RAC he was awarded a prize of 10,000 rubles. The team presented its captain the golden sword \\"Gratitude of the Nevas crew\\". Return of the Nadezhda  Panorama of the Saint Helena island, 1727 Transition through the South China Sea in the typhoon season was quite dangerous. On March 1, the island Krakatoa got visible, and the crew discovered a safe passage nearby. Leaving the Sunda Strait, the sloop Nadezhda was able to cope with the current that carried it to the reefs only because of a rising wind. The sloop reached the Indian Ocean on March 3. During the massive storm on March 11, the topmast on the Neva was damaged, while a jibboom got cracked on the Nadezhda. On April 2, when sloops passed the meridian of St. Petersburg, lieutenant Petr Golovachev tried to commit suicide, but, for some reason, missed a shot. Doctor Espenberg was the first one who reacted to the sound of a shot and on the smell of gunpowder. On April 15 Nadezhda parted with Neva, and, besides, Krusenstern realized that it was a conscious decision of Lisyansky to take another course. In four days Krusenstern rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and on May 3 he arrived in the Saint Helena island, transitioning from Macau in 79 days. Lieutenant Levenstern was the first who went ashore, bringing with him the news about the war between Russia and France. In the morning on May 4, Ratmanov and Krusenstern were going to visit the shore, and Golovachev was on duty and \\"as usual and with a cheerful look\\" reported to them. At 10 am, Tilesius also left the sloop and said to the commander and the first assistant that 29-year-old Golovachev committed suicide. According to the diaries of Levenstern, he shoot himself in the face and badly disfigured it. According to Ratmanov and Levenstern, while being on the Marquesas Islands, Golovachev took the Rezanov's side and was counting on a career in the RAC. However, as a result, he quarrelled with the officers who saw in him the ambassador's henchman. Probably, he thought about a suicide while being in China, because he made presents with his monogram for many officers. Before his last act, he left accusatory letters to Krusenstern, Tilesius and Romberg, and enclosed a letter to the emperor in a packet with a message to Krusenstern. Levenstern described in his diary the content of the letters to his colleagues. After Nadezhda returned to St. Petersburg, Alexander I ordered to burn the Golovachev's letter without opening, and not to conduct any investigations. Governor of the island Robert Patton said to Krusenstern that person who experienced melancholia could not be considered as a suicidal. Thus, the Anglican priest buried Golovachev with military honours, leaving the Latin epitaph composed by Espenberg on the tombstone. It was impossible to get any proviant on Saint Helena because all flour products almost entirely went to the English squadron, and all the other products were costly. For instance, three guineas were asked for a ram, a bag of potatoes in two and a half pounds cost one guinea, chicken or duck ‚Äì half of a guinea, 20 eggs ‚Äì piastre, etc. As a result, upon to arrival in Copenhagen, the crew had to use only their stocks. After finding out about the war with France, Krusenstern regretted Lisyansky's self-will; besides, some of the guns were left in Kamchatka, and the English garrison could not offer a replacement for Russian ammunition. Thus, having only 12 guns on board, Krusenstern decided to round Scotland in the North Sea through the Orkney islands. At noon on May 8, the sloop Nadezhda left Jamestown. For the fourth and last time, the vessel crossed the Equator on May 21 in the Saint Nicholas day, being at 22¬∞ West longitude. On July 17, the ship passed between the islands of Fair Isle and Mainland of the Shetland islands, and on July 21 got closer to the Norwegian shores. On the island of Fair the crew managed to buy fresh fish, eggs and lamb. On July 23, the ship came across the English frigate Quebec, where for the first time Krusenstern received information about Lisyansky, who had left Portsmouth a week before and was being escorted by an English squadron. Nadezhda arrived in Copenhagen at 10 am on August 2. Sailing from China lasted five months 24 days, minus the 4-day stay at the Saint Helena island when only a small part of the crew went ashore. The captain reported the absence of scurvy patients on board. The ship anchored in Kronstadt on August 19, being absent for 3 years and 12 days. On August 21-22 admiral Pavel Chichagov and count Rumyantsev visited the ship. On August 27 Krusenstern was invited to the Kamenny Island Palace. During the audience, the empress mother Maria Feodorovna granted the captain a diamond snuffbox as a sign of the highest favour. On August 30 Alexander I visited the Nadezhda and was on the board until 3 pm. All officers were granted with ranks and pensions. Krusenstern was also awarded Saint Vladimir order 3rd rank and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences. Horner and Tilesius received pension in 1000 rubles that was paid to them in . Sailors of both the Neva and Nadezhda received a retirement with a pension of 50 rubles per year. Results. Commemoration =Geographic discoveries= Crews on Nadezhda and Neva made several discoveries in the Pacific, closing the last undiscovered areas in its Northern part. Lisyansky, together with the Nevas navigator Dmitry Kalinin described the Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska, and also the part of the Alexander Archipelago. Wherein west of the Sitka island Kalinin discovered the Kruzof Island, that was previously considered as an archipelago. Lisyansky named a large island to the North of Sitka as the Chichagof Island. On the way from Kodiak to Macau, they discovered an inhabitant Lisianski Island and Neva reef, belonging to the Hawaiian islands. To the southwest of them the expedition discovered the . On the way from Japan to Kamchatka, Krusenstern went through the Tsushima Strait to the Sea of Japan, and depicted the Western coast of Hokkaido. They discovered a small Gulf of Patience. Given names are still present even in contemporary maps, for instance, capes of Senyavin and Soymonov. While transitioning through the Greater Kuril Chain, Krusenstern discovered four \\"Lovushki\\" islands. Then, while passing the Nadezhda Strait, the Krusenstern's crew reached the Cape Patience where it started shooting the way to Cape Levenstern, overall, 900 kilometres. Then they discovered the Northern Strait, the capes at the entrance and at the exit of which received names \\"Elizabeth\\" and \\"Maria\\" correspondingly. Near with the Northern access to the Amur Liman, the water depth was not significant, and Krusenstern concluded that Sakhalin was a peninsula. Participants of the first Russian circumnavigation conducted different oceanographic observations. They discovered the Equatorial Counter Current in Atlantic and the Pacific, measured the temperature difference at depths up to 400 m and determined its specific gravity, clarity and colour. They also found the reason behind the Milky seas effect and collected numerous data on atmospheric pressure, and tides in several areas of the oceans. =Publishing the results of the expedition= The first edition of Travelling around the world by Krusenstern The Krusenstern's expedition aroused great interest both in Russia and in Europe that lasted several decades. Conducted ethnographic collection was first put in the Museum of the Admiralty Department. After the assortment, the collection was sent to Kunstkamera. The collection included goods from the Easter island, Marquesas and Hawaiian archipelagos. Illustrations easily attributed all items. The expedition's works were widely replicated: at public expense in 1809‚Äì1812 on both the Russian and German languages were published the Krusenstern's three-volume Journey Around the World (1310 pages) with an atlas. Atlas included 32 landscapes of the islands that the expedition visited; 44 ethnic types (Polynesians, Japanese, Chinese, Ainu, Kamchadals, Aleuts, Nivkhs); maps of the islands and shores. In 1913 Krusenstern's book was translated to English, and then to French, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish. Lisyansky's description of the events was published in 1812 on his own money (18 500 rubles) with illustrations and carefully compiled maps. This book interested the West, in 1814 it was published in London in the Lisyansky's translation which was quite different from the Russian version. Langsdorf's description was published in 1812‚Äì1814 in German and English but was not translated to Russian. Diaries and notes of the crews are also available. Korobitsyn' notes were fully published only in 1944 after 50 years notes of Hieromonk Gideon were published, which provide important information on the ethnography of Alaska. In the years 1816-1818 and 1822‚Äì1825, the official reports made by Rezanov and Shemelin were published that described in many details the way how negotiations in Japan went. In 1820 S. Pryor published in London a description of all the circumnavigations made by then, in which Krusenstern's expedition was put in the same line with the Magellan's. Upon to the 1950s, Krusenstern's description was not reprinted in the Russian language. The last edition was abridged: from the third (scientific) part, only notes of Kamchadal and Marquise music (performed by Tilesius) and a letter from Commerce Minister Count Rumyantsev were left. By the 200th anniversary of the end of the expedition in 2007, the third edition re-released the 1950s variant. The second edition by Lisyansky was published in 1947 by the publishing house Geografiz. However, it was also abridged ‚Äì all the detailed descriptions of astronomical and navigational characteristics, price lists for products and goods, were removed. In 1977 this edition was re-published in Vladivostok by the Far Eastern Book Publishing House. Geografgizs edition formed the basis of the third edition of 2007, released on the anniversary of the expedition. The richly illustrated volumes of the travels of Krusenstern and Lisyansky were also published in the series \\"The Great Travels\\" of the publishing house Eksmo. Despite the abundance of published materials, by the end of the XXth century, some of the unpublished diaries, journals and illustrations were stored in the archives. For instance: the journal conducted by the Nevas navigator Dmitry Kalinin, notes by Tilesius, manuscript by counterman Shemelin. In 2003 the previously unpublished Levenstern's diary came out in both Russian and English languages. Tamara Shafranovskaya did the Russian translation. In 2005 the album Around the world with Krusenstern (edited by O. Fedorova and A. Krusenstern), in the basis of which lied Atlas with drawings of Tilesius, which was supplemented with botanic illustrations made by Langsdorf, and also previously unpublished pictures from Tilesius and Levenstern' archives. Besides a comprehensive foreword and appendixes, the text included a full chronicle of the events that we're representing a systematic selection of diaries of those participating in the expedition. In 2015 the same team of authors published all the Ratmanov's journals with extensive commentaries. For the first, watercolour paintings made by astronomer Horner and naturalist Langsdorf were published. = Commemoration = Postmark, 1994 According to E. Govor, Soviet and contemporary Russian historiography interpret Russian expeditions in the context of Imperial history. All achievements, including those of Lisyansky and Krusenstern, were studied from the position of impact to geographic discoveries, natural history and ethnography. In Soviet times, it was supplemented with anti-colonial propaganda in the framework of which many actions made by commanders and crews, including the foreign ones, were silenced. Nevertheless, starting from the 1980s, the first Russian circumnavigation has become a new object for a new historical reflection. First of all, it related to its representation in a four-volume monograph by Glen Barath, published in 1988‚Äì1992. In Russia, scientists (in the context of a more broad scope of studies on Russian America), O. Fedorova and T. Shafranovskaya. E. Govor claims that published and commented sources create a significant base for further research on the subject. In 2010 Govor published a complex monograph Twelve days on Nuku Khiva that received many positive reviews from other specialists. Honorary polar explorer L. M. Sverdlov dedicated several publications to the relationship between Rezanov and Krusenstern. After he discovered new documents in the related to conflict between the captain and chamberlain, Sverdlov published two monographs in 2006 and 2016 correspondingly. Krusenstern and Lisyansky's expedition became a subject of artistic reflection in children's literature. In 1930 published the novel Ivan Krusenstern and Yuri Lisyansky ‚Äì first Russian captains that rounded the world, that in 1941 was included in the book Frigate Drivers. Events and characters of the first Russian circumnavigation lie in the core of the adventure novel Islands and captains by Vladislav Krapivin (1984‚Äì1987). Phrase from the cartoon ' \\"Ivan Fedorovich Krusenstern ‚Äì a person and a steamboat\\" became an aphorism. At the same time, in the context of the cartoon, none of the main characters knew who were they talking about. In 1993 the Central Bank of Russia released a series of commemorative coins of Russia dedicated to the first Russian circumnavigation. Russia, Estonia, Ukraine and Saint Helena island released postmarks dedicated to Krusenstern and the first Russian circumnavigation. In December 2013 the 4-episode documentary series 'Neva and Nadezhda: The first Russian circumnavigation, directed by Russian journalist Mikhail Kozhukhov, were released on the state channel Russia-1.

The ROM cartridge version had instantaneous loading as well as a greater amount of available free RAM for user definitions. In contrast with large-scale LISP implementations, Acornsoft's variant only had a modest number of built-in definitions as it had to fit in the limited memory space of the 8-bit Acorn computers. The interpreter was implemented in 6502 machine-code and was 5.5K in size. It was based on Owl LISP written by Mike Gardner of Owl Computers, which he published for the Apple II in 1979. Acornsoft licensed it from Owl Computers in 1981 and developed it for the Acorn Atom and BBC Microcomputer. The supplied LISP workspace image containing commonly used built-in functions and constants was 3K in size, although this could be deleted if not needed by the user to free up more memory. Supported datatypes included nested lists, 16-bit signed integers and strings up to 127 characters in length. LOOP, WHILE and UNTIL keywords were available for program control. Acornsoft also commissioned a book \\"LISP on the BBC Microcomputer\\", by Arthur Norman and Gillian Cattell, published in 1983. Arthur Norman was a lecturer in computer science at Cambridge University, and Gillian Cattell did research into LISP at Cambridge. The book was sold separately from the software and contained examples illustrating use of the Acornsoft specific features such as the VDU function allowing for machine-specific graphics capabilities. The book also contained working examples including a tree-sorting program, an arbitrary arithmetic package, an animal guessing game, a route finding program, a graphics package, a simple compiler and an adventure game.

Since it was located in a growing city, it is larger than most other post offices built around the same time. In its Classical Revival design hints of the emerging Art Deco style can be seen. It remains largely intact today. Building The post office building occupies the block between Main Street on the south, Buena Vista Avenue on the east, Nepperhan Street on the north and Market Place to the east. The terrain is level, reflecting the proximity of the Hudson River to the west just beyond the railroad tracks used by Amtrak and Metro-North's Hudson Line. The 1911 Beaux- Arts main building of the Yonkers train station is to the northwest. On the north, the square has a small park at its center, yielding to a parking lot on the northeast. The city's new library building is across the square, in buildings once used by the Otis Elevator Company. To the east, the two blocks between Market and Riverdale Avenue (U.S. Route 9 and New York State Route 9A) have dense urban development consisting of multistory commercial buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site, a National Historic Landmark, is a block to their north. South and southeast are larger, more modern office buildings. The Yonkers Trolley Barn, also on the National Register and now remodeled into apartments, is on the southwest. =Exterior= There is a flagpole on the southwest corner of the block. Narrow hedges on all but the east side set off the building. The building itself is a two-story steel frame structure faced on all sides by smooth buff limestone topped by a flat roof. Those facades form a roughly square building with the exception of the irregular east. They are 15 bays wide on the south (Main Street) side, 13 on Market Street, 11 on Nepperhan and nine on Buena Vista. Atop is a flat roof. With the exception of the east, which serves as a loading dock, all facades have a similar decorative treatment: flat engaged Corinthian pilasters dividing all bays save those on the corners, which are set off on the non-corner side by paired pilasters. All support an entablature with a frieze decorated with curved rosettes. At the roofline is a denticulated cornice with a balustraded parapet. On the first story, windows are four-over-four double-hung sash with a four-light transom. The second story has similar windows but without the transoms. The west and south facades have centrally located entrances, with steps on the former due to the slight grade. They take up three bays each, with original bronze lampposts on either side. Each bay has a bronze double door flanked by engaged fluted pilasters and topped with a ten-light transom. Above it is a lintel with geometric designs and a foliate relief carving. In the first bay of the north facade and the second-to-last bay of the east facade is an additional single-bay entrance with similar treatment; the former is no longer in use. A large covered loading platform runs the full width of the first story of the Market Street facade on the east. The central three bays have garage doors built into the wall to allow trucks to unload directly to the indoors; the outer three on both sides have platforms. Above them is a second story with the same window treatment as found elsewhere on the building. =Interior= Both entrances lead through bronze vestibules to an L-shaped lobby with its original terrazzo floors and buff marble wainscoting. Flat marble Corinthian pilasters, also buff, rise on both the inside and outside walls to the coffered plaster ceiling divided by beams at each bay. Low-relief decoration is on almost every surface. On the outside wall are oak bulletin boards framed by marble. The oak customer tables are original. An open L-shaped staircase with marble steps and a brass banister leads up to the second floor. On the interior wall, lockboxes and teller windows delineate the work areas of the post office. Behind them is the workroom. Upstairs are offices and the swing room, with the basement given over to mechanical rooms and storage. History =Context= Yonkers began receiving mail regularly when the Albany Post Road was completed shortly after the Revolution. At that time it was delivered to Philipse Manor, a short distance from the location of the present building. In 1788 mail began being delivered to Old Hunt's Tavern nearby; it was replaced nine years later, in 1797, by the first official post office in the country store of Yonkers' first postmaster, Alpheus Pierson, on the block where the current building is. In 1863 free delivery began. In the late 19th century Yonkers began growing rapidly. At first it was due to industrialization, spurred by the completion of the Hudson River Railroad in 1849. Many were textile mills, but there were others, such as the Otis Elevator Company, which had set up shop in the city in 1854. Yonkers became a city in 1872. The postmaster's job soon became politicized, a patronage position awarded to those who had kept Westchester County's political leaders in power. This was true in many of the communities but even more so in Yonkers due to the volume of mail. Politicians would hold their informal meetings there, in the postmaster's office out of public view, and call other postmasters there if they failed in their political duties. This practice led to the appointment of postmasters who were incompetent at or cared little about the operations of their office and the delivery of mail. In 1905 an especially incompetent postmaster and his assistant were fired after much public anger over the poor quality of postal service in the city. President Theodore Roosevelt personally appointed, on an interim basis, John Parsons, a New York City customs agent. He told the local politicians who complained that Parsons had only lived in Yonkers for three months and was not yet registered to vote there that they had no credibility with him. Parsons took his job very seriously, and within a short time vastly improved Yonkers' mail service. Roosevelt later gave him a full four-year commission. When it expired in 1909, however, Roosevelt was no longer president. Despite having made no accommodation to the politicians who had controlled his predecessors, he sought reappointment. The city's Republican chairman declined to do so, publicly recalling how he had been appointed in flagrant disregard of their input. Instead a recently defeated mayoral candidate got the job. Citizens rallied to keep Parsons, to no avail. As the century ended, Yonkers began to grow even more due to suburban development, as wealthy residents of New York City to the south realized they could live in larger houses in more pastoral surroundings and still take the train every day to their jobs and businesses in the city. A new post office was needed, and in 1906 Congress passed the first of several laws authorizing its construction. It was not until 1916 that the actual land could be purchased, and over the next three years the federal government spent $322,500 ($ in modern dollars) buying the land and the buildings on it, which included not only the old post office and its telegraph building but a hotel, store, junkyard and gasometer. The location of the planned new post office was personally chosen by Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo, a onetime resident of Yonkers, on a tour of the site with Rep. Woodson R. Oglesby. McAdoo cited its proximity to both the railroad and the city's trolley lines. Actual construction had to wait until Congress reauthorized it in the Public Buildings Act of 1926. The original budget was raised to $520,000 ($ in modern dollars) and the building was completed one year later, in 1927. =Completed post office= The completed post office was larger than most others built in New York around the same time, most of which were smaller brick buildings in the Colonial Revival architectural style. Yonkers' large and growing population necessitated a correspondingly large post office, and like other larger urban New York post offices of the time, such as those in Potsdam and Wellsville, the Classical Revival mode was preferred. James A. Wetmore, Supervising Architect at the Treasury Department, is credited with the design, as he is with many other federal buildings during his 18 years as Supervising Architect. He was, however, a political appointee and lawyer with no architectural training; that was generally left to Louis A. Simon, the office's Superintendent of Architects, who succeeded Wetmore and served until the position was abolished in 1939. Yonkers's post office is distinguished by its massing, which creates a monumentality reinforced by the pilasters around the facade. It is offset by the restrained relief, repetition of forms and smooth flat surfaces, features typical of the Classical Revival during that period, which convey both the dignity of a government building and the economizing the government was undertaking at the time. They also anticipate the Art Deco stylings that would become more prominent in later post offices like the main one on Staten Island, completed in 1931. There have been a few small changes to the building since 1927. Most noticeably, the loading dock area has been altered slightly. Since the building was listed, its central portion, once sided in yellow brick, now matches the limestone on the rest of the building. On the north facade, the Nepperhan Street entrance has been closed off so that an office could be built next to it. In the lobby, some of the teller windows have been altered and the original lighting replaced. Otherwise, all furniture and finishes are original.

Retrieved 5 October 2010. Early life Boyesen was born in Copenhagen in 1819 or 1820. His parents were Peter Thyge Boyesen, a wholesaler, and Maria Christine Lange. After training as a painter's apprentice, he went to Munich in 1845 together with his colleague Theodor Meldahl, a brother of the architect Ferdinand Meldahl. Here he stayed for 10 years, working as a photographer before leaving for Rome where he spent the rest of his life. Years in Rome Always modest and reserved, he usually photographed outdoor scenes, genre pictures or portraits which he sold to artists and tourists. Frederik G. Knudtzon, who wrote one of the most interesting accounts of life among the Scandinavians in Rome in the 19th century, spoke of \\"the Danish photographer Pietro Boyesen, who was rarely seen, because he was always busy.\\" Boyesen was later able to supplement his income by working as a clerk for the German embassy. He took photographs of animals and plants, as well as pictures depicting the lives of ordinary Italians. Many of his photographs are carte de visite shots of Scandinavians visiting Rome, taken in the yard outside his studio door. Over the door frame, the word \\"Roma\\" can be seen, sometimes with the year when the photograph was taken, and on either side of the door there are various flowers, some in pots. Boyesen had a talent for composition and characterization. In contrast to the staid studio portraits which were so common at the time, Boyesen would have his subjects pose outdoors in intimate Roman settings. By playing with the subjects' clothes and their relationship to the surroundings, Boyesen would produce works presenting a somewhat timid but intimate charm.\\"Peter (Pietro) Thyge Boyesen (1819‚Äì1882) Fotograf\\" in Inge-Lise og Steen Neergaard, \\"Vi kom fra Danmark\\", Books on Demand Gmbh, Copenhagen. .

Its main objective is transforming the country into a knowledge-based middle-income country, thereby reducing poverty, health problems and making the nation united and democratic.  Overview  The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aims to achieve before the year 2020. These are: * Good governance * An efficient state * Skilled human capital, including education, health and information technology * A vibrant private sector * A world-class physical infrastructure * Modern agriculture and livestock  History  In the late 1990s, president Paul Kagame and his government began actively planning methods to achieve national development. He launched a national consultation process and also sought the advice of experts from emerging nations including China, Singapore and Thailand. Following these consultations, and shortly after assuming the presidency, Kagame launched Vision 2020. The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a middle income country.  Progress  In 2011, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning issued a report indicating the progress of the Vision 2020 goals. The report examined the stated goals of the programme and rated each one with a status of \\"on-track\\", \\"on-watch\\" or \\"off- track\\". Of 44 goals, it found that were on-track, were on-watch, and were off- track. The major areas identified as off-track were population, poverty and the environment. Research into Vision 2020, carried out in 2012 by academics based in Belgium, has rated progress as \\"quite encouraging\\", mentioning development in the education and health sectors, as well as Kagame's fostering of a favourable business environment. The research also raised concerns about the policy of \\"maximum growth at any cost\\", suggesting that this was leading to a situation in which the rich prospered while the rural poor saw little benefit. In November 2013, Kagame told This Is Africa ‚ÄúOur thinking is based on people. In national budgets, we focus on education, health, we look at technology, skills, innovation, creativity. We are always thinking about people, people, people.‚Äù  References  Cited sources:   External links  Government of Rwanda 2020 in Rwanda Future vision statements of countries ","title":"Vision 2020 (Rwanda)"},{"id":"29041235","text":"Admiral Sir James Edward Clifford Goodrich (28 June 1851 ‚Äì 1 September 1925) was the last Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station.

The roof of the nave is in slate, and the roofs of the chancel and tower are tiled. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave, a two-bay chancel and a west tower. The tower is built partly within the west end of the nave. It is in two stages, and has diagonal buttresses and a pyramidal roof. In the lower stage is a three-light west window, and the upper stage has three-light bell openings. The parapet is battlemented. The nave contains three-light, arched, mullioned windows. There are Tudor arched doorways in both the north and south walls. On the east gable is a finial. The east window has three lights. In the south wall of the chancel is a pair of two-light windows with Decorated tracery, and a round-arched priest's door. =Interior= In the chancel is a trefoil-headed piscina and a tomb recess. On each side of the east window is a bracket for an image. Also in the chancel is a marble memorial to Anthony Furtho, who died in 1558, and his two wives, and a monument to Edmund Arnold dated 1676. The octagonal font is small and dates from the 17th century.

It was opened in 1956, and is the only public museum in the world devoted to globes, being three-dimensional models of Earth or other celestial bodies, or spherical representations of the celestial sphere. History As early as the 19th century, there was a globe collection within the Vienna Imperial Library, the forerunner to the Austrian National Library. The globes in this collection were acquired either as purchases or as gifts (for example, Vincenzo Coronelli created two globes especially for Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor from 1658 to 1705, with each globe having an engraved portrait of the Emperor and an inscription). In 1921, the geographer, Eugen Oberhummer, conducted an inventory of the collection and found eight globes of various sizes (both terrestrial and celestial), and two armillary spheres. In 1922, these globes were transferred to the National Library's map collection where, by 1948, there were already 28 globes. In the annual report of the director of the collection in 1948, it was noted that the globes were among the collection's most rarely used items. In 1956, the National Library opened the Globe Museum with a total of 63 exhibits. Its foundation collection was a combination of the imperial collection and the collections of The International Coronelli Society for the Study of Globes, and the cartographer Robert Haardt, who had been instrumental in the museum's establishment. The museum was originally housed in the Augustinian tract of the Hofburg in Josefsplatz, Vienna, as part of the National Library's map collection. In 1970 and 1986, the museum was allocated new rooms within the same tract. During the museum's first 30 years, its collection grew to 145 items by purchase, gift and exchange with other museums. By 1996, the museum had 260 exhibits. Since the end of 2005 the museum has been accommodated at the Palais Mollard in the Herrengasse. Collection There are now approximately 600 terrestrial and celestial globes in the collection, and around 200 of them are constantly on display. The majority of them date from before 1850. The oldest item in the collection is the terrestrial globe of Gemma Frisius (circa 1536). Highlights are the globes of Vincenzo Coronelli ( diameter) and a pair of globes by Gerard Mercator from 1541 and 1551. Further objects in the collection include armillary spheres, planetary globes, astronomical instruments, and instruments in which a globe represents a component, such as planet machines (orreries), tellurions and lunariums.

Synaeresis, the pronunciation of two vowels as a diphthong (or as a long vowel), is the opposite of the first definition. Etymology Diaeresis comes from the Ancient Greek noun dia√≠resis (Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒØœÅŒµœÉŒπœÇ) \\"taking apart\\" or \\"division\\" (also \\"distinction\\"), from the verb diair√©≈ç (Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒπœÅŒ≠œâ) \\"take apart\\", a compound of the verb air√©≈ç (Œ±·º±œÅŒ≠œâ) \\"take\\" and the preposition di√° (Œ¥ŒπŒ¨) \\"through\\" (in compounds, \\"apart\\"). and French In the phonology of Standard French, the letters ie are normally pronounced or except after Cr or Cl, when they indicate two syllables, or . (That exception came into the language only around the 17th century, as can be seen in poems before then.) In some French dialects, however, diaeresis is the norm, with the two-syllable pronunciation found after any consonant. In Standard French, the pronunciation of hier (yesterday) varies between the two, or , depending on the context. Greek Diaeresis as separate pronunciation of vowels in a diphthong was first named where it occurred in the poetry of Homer. =Example= *·ºÄŒªŒªŒ¨ ŒºŒøŒπ ·ºÄŒºœÜ·æø ·ΩàŒ¥œÖœÉ·øÜœä Œ¥Œ±ŒêœÜœÅŒøŒΩŒπ Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒµœÑŒ±Œπ ·øÜœÑŒøœÅ... But my soul is torn about Odysseus the fiery-hearted... *: In this example, diaereses are in bold. The vowels in each diaeresis are placed in separate syllables when the line is scanned: *ŒëŒõ ŒªŒ± ŒºŒøŒπ ŒëŒú œÜŒø Œ¥œÖ Œ£Œó Œπ Œ¥Œ± ŒôŒ¶ œÅŒø ŒΩŒπ ŒîŒëŒô Œµ œÑŒ±Œπ Œó Œ§ŒüŒ° Dactylic hexameter depends on the sequence of long and short (or heavy and light) syllables. It is composed of six feet, five of which are in two basic patterns: long-short-short (dactyl) or long-long (spondee). In the scansion of the line above, long syllables are uppercase, short syllables are lowercase, and feet are divided by a vertical line. All feet in the line conform to one of the two patterns of dactylic hexameter. If the pairs of vowels are contracted into diphthongs by synaeresis (i.e., ·ΩàŒ¥œÖœÉ·øá Œ¥Œ±ŒØœÜœÅŒøŒΩŒπ) and the diphthongs are placed in one syllable each, one foot (in ) no longer follows the patterns, no matter how the line is scanned: *ŒëŒõ ŒªŒ± ŒºŒøŒπ ŒëŒú œÜŒø Œ¥œÖ  ŒîŒëŒôŒ¶ œÅŒø ŒΩŒπ ŒîŒëŒô Œµ œÑŒ±Œπ Œó Œ§ŒüŒ° *ŒëŒõ ŒªŒ± ŒºŒøŒπ ŒëŒú œÜŒø Œ¥œÖ Œ£ŒóŒô ŒîŒëŒôŒ¶  ŒîŒëŒô Œµ œÑŒ±Œπ Œó Œ§ŒüŒ° =Œï·Ωñ= In Homer, compounds beginning with ·ºêœç- (also spelled ·ºêŒ∞-, with a diaeresis or trema) frequently contain two separate vowels (diaeresis). In later Greek, the two vowels form a diphthong (synaeresis).

An exponent of Islamic anthropology, she is director of the Muslim Institute, London. Biography Merryl Wyn Davies was born on 23 June 1948 in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. After reading anthropology at University College, London, Davies began a career in broadcasting and journalism. Following jobs with local Welsh newspapers, and a stint with BBC Radio, Davies spent a decade with BBC TV Religious programmes, working on such award-winning shows as ‚ÄòEveryman‚Äô, ‚ÄòHeart of the Matter‚Äô and ‚ÄòGlobal Report‚Äô and the series, ‚ÄòEncounters with Islam‚Äô. In 1985 she left the BBC to write independently and to work for the London-based Muslim magazine Inquiry. During the 1990s, she worked as advisor and speech writer for Anwar Ibrahim, the former Deputy Prime Minister and now the Leader of the Opposition; and produced the ‚ÄòFaces of Islam‚Äô series for TV3 Malaysia. She returned to the UK in 1996 and became Media Officer for the Muslim Council of Britain. In 2009, she joined the Muslim Institute of London to become its Director.  Thought  A writer on Islam, Davies pioneered a new approach to Islamic anthropology and a highly original critique of America based on Hollywood films. In her work, Knowing One Another: Shaping an Islamic Anthropology, Davies developed a new mode of inquiry which she described, ‚Äòafter ibn Khaldun, as ilm ul umran‚Äô: a radical discourse shaped by dialogue between civilisations and cultures and based on an holistic understanding of what it means to be human. Anthropology, Davies argued, is basic to fostering understanding between and amongst people. It equips Muslims with both self-knowledge and the understanding to treat non- Muslims with tolerance. Such knowledge will enable Muslims to play a constructive part in the modern world‚Äôs constructive future. In three books on America, written with Ziauddin Sardar, Davies develops ‚Äòlaws of American mythology‚Äô (‚ÄòFear is essential‚Äô; ‚ÄòEscape is the reason for being‚Äô, ‚ÄòAmerica is the idea of nation‚Äô, ‚ÄòAmerican democracy has the right to be imperial and express itself through empire‚Äô, ‚Äòcinema is the engine of empire‚Äô etc.) which, she argues, are essential to understand the psychology of America, the security state, its foreign policy and international behaviour.

The project was strongly promoted by the government from 1954, although plans for a dam in the area for the purpose of flood control had been drawn up in 1941. Preliminary site work began from 1953; however, negotiations for compensation for the 520 households displaced by the dam proved to be complicated, and were not concluded until in 1981, the year that the dam opened. During the construction phase the formation of a community driven development association to work alongside government agencies resulted in maximizing community benefits from the development, including creation of a multi-functional community asset and tourist attraction. Design The initial design for the dam in 1941 called for a concrete gravity dam with a height of 32.5 meters. However, after many revisions, the Gosho Dam was completed as a hybrid design incorporating a concrete gravity dam with a central spillway together with a sloped wall rockfill dam. The dam was completed in 1981 by a joint venture of the Kajima Corporation with Nishimatsu Construction. The dam supplies the 13,000 KW Gosho Hydroelectric Power Plant. The Gosho Reservoir created by the dam is a popular vacation location due to its ease of access to the metropolis of Morioka.

Description This genus is readily distinguishable from Lienardia by the apex. The multispiral protoconch consists of a cone of 3¬Ω smooth rounded whorls. It lacks the characteristic diagonally cancellated sculpture of the other genera in this family. The succeeding adult whorls not only differ in sculpture, but are wound in so divergent a spiral and increase at so disproportionate rate as to project that protoconch in a mucronate point. In the colour of the type the contrast is even more violent, as there the brilliant snow-white apex against the deep rose-red is visible to the naked eye. Another generic feature is an opaque peripheral zone. The deep-seated columella folds, so conspicuous in Lienardia, are here less developed. The species are small, short, stumpy and usually brightly coloured. They frequent the upper zone of coral reefs. Hedley, C. 1922. A revision of the Australian Turridae.

He was the founding Director and later Emeritus Director of the Institute of USA and Canada of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (ISKRAN), the Soviet and Russian think tank for the study of USA and Canada. Early career Arbatov was born the son of a prominent Bolshevik, Arkady Arbatov, who was part of several Soviet trade missions in the 1930s. Arbatov fought in the Red Army during World War II, taking part in the Revolution Day parade on Red Square on 7 November 1941 and heading from there to the front lines. Arbatov finished the war as chief of staff of the 17th Guards mortar regiment and was awarded the Order of the Red Star in 1943.

According to the CIA, Arbatov was an intermediary between the Politburo and the KGB.CIA.gov Arbatov became the face of the Soviet Union in the West, where he used his strong, though heavily accented, command of the English language to help foster ties with American officials and to present Soviet views to the American public, sparring on American television with such individuals as General Bernard Rogers, the former commander of NATO regarding the military deterrent in Western Europe to Soviet forces.Corry, John. \\"TV REVIEW; Speaking for, and Speaking to, the Russians\\", The New York Times, December 10, 1987.

Billy Graham, who had called Communism \\"satanic\\", said that he had \\"met a very wonderful official here\\" after spending three hours together during Graham's 1982 visit to Moscow.

Sergey Rogov, who succeeded him in 1995 as director of the Institute for U.S.A. and Canada Studies called Arbatov someone who \\"was probably willing more than anybody else to stick his neck out\\" to mitigate the influence of anti-American hard liners in the Soviet regime, though \\"he knew pretty well what were the red lines that he could not cross publicly, and he was very cautious about it\\". Arbatov recognized that the Soviet Union had lost the Cold War, but insisted that the United States had suffered too by losing \\"The Enemy\\", a main adversary consisting of one country on which to concentrate efforts. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Arbatov was an adviser to the State Duma and a member of the foreign policy council of the foreign Ministry Russian Federation between 1991 and 1996.

There is evidence that it has two isomeric forms of comparable stability (trans, cis, trans, cis, trans, trans, cis- with four interior hydrogens (shown in the infobox) and trans, cis, trans, cis, trans, cis, cis- with three interior hydrogens) which rapidly interconvert at room temperature but can be observed at low temperature by NMR. Its 1H NMR spectrum shows evidence of aromatic ring currents that result in an upfield shift for the interior hydrogens. In contrast, the corresponding [12]- and [16]annulenes, which are weakly antiaromatic or nonaromatic, have downfield shifted interior hydrogens. However, unlike the undoubtedly aromatic [18]annulene, [14]annulene does not bear the hallmark aromatic property of chemical stability, and it quickly decomposes when exposed to light and air.

It was part of Vuk Brankovic‚Äôs realm and Pavle Orlovic‚Äôs fiefdom. Those who were empowered to act as Orlovic‚Äôs bodyguards or as a police force were known as ƒçuvar (meaning ‚Äúguardian‚Äù in Old Slavonic) and √ßanavar (meaning ‚Äúbrave‚Äù in Gheg Albanian).Tzavaras, Ath. op.cit.

In the escape the majority chose the Kingdom of Hungary, where the core of the Serbian nobility had gathered to resist.

Construction  The arithmetic progression associated to two (possibly non-distinct) numbers a and k, where a, k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}: k eq 0, is the set of integers : a + k \\\\mathbb{Z} := \\\\\\\\{ a + k \\\\lambda : \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\\\\\}.

The family of all arithmetic progressions does not satisfy these axioms: the union of arithmetic progressions need not be an arithmetic progression itself, e.g., } is not an arithmetic progression. So the evenly spaced integer topology is defined to be the topology generated by the family of arithmetic progressions. This is the coarsest topology that includes as open subsets the family of all arithmetic progressions: that is, arithmetic progressions are a subbase for the topology. Since the intersection of any finite collection of arithmetic progressions is again an arithmetic progression, the family of arithmetic progressions is a base for the topology, meaning that every open set is a union of arithmetic progressions.

The need for a dam primarily for flood control was emphasized by Typhoon Ione in September of the following year, which killed an additional 1956 people. The dam was first completed by the Kajima Corporation in 1968. Design The Shij≈´shida Dam was designed as a concrete gravity arch dam; however, since the rocks on both banks were weak, the dam was completed as a hybrid design with earthen dams on the sides and a concrete gravity dam in the center. The project was complicated by the extreme acidity of the water (reaching pH of 4.0) due to runoff from the Matsuo mine upstream. This acidity resulted in the use of special concrete and alloy materials. Generators for the associated hydroelectric power plant product 15,100 KW of electricity.

Located on the Waga River, a branch of the Kitakami River, it is the third largest of the dams built as part of the Kitakami Area Comprehensive Development Plan (KVA). The dam creates Lake Kinshu, a popular sightseeing spot. History The lower reaches of the Kitakami River are subject to flooding, especially near its dual mouths at the city of Ichinoseki, Iwate, and plans to increase the river width were impractical due to urbanisation of the area. The Home Ministry, together with Tokyo Imperial University drafted a flood control plan in 1926, which was upgraded in 1938 when implementation began. The plan called for the construction of five large dams on the main stream of the Kitakami River and its major branches. However, only Tase Dam was completed before work on the project ceased due to World War II. Work resumed immediately after the end of the war; however, typhoons in 1947 and 1948 created severe damage nationwide and led to a restructuring of Japan's flood control priorities and need for increased hydroelectric power generation. In 1949, the number of planned dams was increased to ten, and the location of Yuda Dam was changed from the initial plan to the local point about 13 kilometers downstream in the Waga River. Under the 1950 National Land Planning Act promulgated by the Yoshida administration, work on the Yuda Dam came under the aegis of the Kitakami Area Comprehensive Development Plan (KVA), which was modelled after the American Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Construction on the dam started in 1953. Opposition to the dam was very strong by local residents, as the dam would submerge the center of the village of Yuda along with much of the villages Kawajiri, Oishi and Ararazawa. The number of people affected was 3200 residents in 622 households. In addition to the loss of homes and agricultural land, the dam also submerged a 13 kilometer section of Japan National Route 107, 15.3 kilometers of the Kitakami Line railway (along with three train stations), 13 mines, two power plants, and one pre-existing dam. For this reason, compensation negotiations were with villagers, Japan National Railway, mining rights owners, forest owners, water rights holders were complex, and drew nationwide attention as the negotiations continued. A settlement was reached in May 1957 and relocation was completed by 1963. The dam was planned as a concrete gravity dam with a height of 89.5 meters. The bedrock was found to be granite and the design was changed to a concrete arch design to reduce the amount on concrete used (and thereby the construction costs); however, the bedrock was later found to have deposit zones and faults, and the design was changed again to a gravity arch design. Per the Japan Dam Association, there are only 12 examples of this design in Japan. Construction was extremely difficult, and in 1960, a new fault zone was discovered and in 1961 construction was further delayed by a collapse of the right bank rock. In 1965 the dam was completed. Lake Kinshu The reservoir formed by the dam is Lake Kinshu, which forms the center of Yuda Onsenky≈ç Prefectural Natural Park. The area is noted for its birdlife and its autumn foliage.

AUSCANZUKUS structure. Structure The current AUSCANNZUKUS organization consists of the Supervisory Board, C4 Committee, and various other subordinate groups. History Early in World War II communications interoperability between Allied forces was poor. During March 1941 the first high-level proposals to formally structure combined operations between the United States and the United Kingdom were considered; these discussions were the genesis of the current Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB). The origins of the AUSCANNZUKUS organization arose from dialogue between Admiral Arleigh Burke, USN, and Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, RN, in 1960. Their intention was to align naval communications policies and prevent, or at least limit, any barriers to interoperability, with the imminent introduction of sophisticated new communications equipment. AUSCANNZUKUS matured to the current five-nation organization in 1980 when New Zealand became a full member. The organization's remit has expanded over the years, and its mission now includes fostering knowledge sharing and C4 interoperability between the navies of the five nations in order to increase operational effectiveness.

MIT Press; . The main claim of this theory is that any given sentence can be changed into a variety of other sentences where the parts of the sentence will change in what they reference, but they will nonetheless maintain the meaning of the sentence as a whole. The referential relation is inscrutable, because it is subject to the background language and ontological commitments of the speaker.  Overview  Along with the holophrastic indeterminacy, the inscrutability of reference is the second kind of indeterminacy that makes up Quine's thesis about the indeterminacy of (radical) translation. While the inscrutability of reference concerns itself with single words, Quine does not want it to be used for propositions, as he attacks those in another way.Bayer, Benjamin: Quine's Pragmatic Solution to Skeptical Doubts. July 6, 2009. He challenges the translation or referential scrutability of whole sentences, proposing his idea of the indeterminacy of translation. In order to accomplish this, Quine makes the statement that there is a so-called holophrastic indeterminacy, which tells that there are always multiple translations of one sentence, .Hylton, Peter: Willard van Orman Quine. In: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, April 9, 2010. This theory, linked with the inscrutability of reference make up the main characteristics of the indeterminacy of translation. The inscrutability of reference can also be used in a more extended way, in order to explain Quine's theory of ontological relativity. We are told that, if we try to determine what the referential object of a certain word is, our answer will always be relative to our own background language. Now, as Quine sees it, this idea is not only limited to language, but applies also for scientific questions and philosophical ones. For example, if we are proposed a philosophical theory, we can never definitely characterize the ontological commitments of it. The most we can do, is to adapt this theory to our current background philosophy, that is .Loux, Michael J.: Metaphysics ‚Äì A Contemporary Introduction. London: Routledge, 3rd edition, 2006, p. 278ff. Because of this theory, Quine was often regarded as a relativist, or even a scientific skepticist. He, however, insisted that he belongs in neither of these categories,Keil, Geert: Quine zur Einf√ºhrung. Hamburg: Junius, 1st edition, 2002, 75ff. and some authors see in the inscrutability of reference an underdetermination of relativism.Swoyer, Chris: Relativism. In: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, February 2, 2003.  Illustration by the use of gavagai  In his indeterminacy of translation theory Quine claims that, if one is to translate a language, there are always several alternative translations, of which none is more correct than the other.Keil (2002), 75ff. A radical translation is therefore impossible. As a special part of this theory the inscrutability of reference indicates that, in trying to find out to which object a certain word (also sentence, sign etc.) of a language refers, there is never only one single possibility. That is even the case, if the possibilities that come into consideration lie very close together. Quine's example of the word gavagai is used to illustrate this. Note that it is also applied at the indeterminacy of translation, but has traditionally been introduced to point up referential inscrutability. The gavagai thought experiment tells about a linguist, who tries to find out, what the expression gavagai means, when uttered by a speaker of a yet unknown, native language upon seeing a rabbit. At first glance, it seems that gavagai simply translates with rabbit. Now, Quine points out that the background language and its referring devices might fool the linguist here, because he is misled in a sense that he always makes direct comparisons between the foreign language and his own. However, when shouting gavagai, and pointing at a rabbit, the natives could as well refer to something like undetached rabbit- parts, or rabbit-tropes and it would not make any observable difference. The behavioural data the linguist could collect from the native speaker would be the same in every case, or to reword it, several translation hypotheses could be built on the same sensoric stimuli. Hence, the reference between the term gavagai and its referring object is language- or framework-dependent, and therefore inscrutable. Quine regards this discovery as trivial, because it is already a widely accepted fact that all the different things one word might refer to can be switched out, because of their proxy functions. Quine does not want to show that those native speakers might speak in interestingly different ways and we cannot know about it, but rather that there is nothing to be known. Not only is it impossible to discern, by any method, the correct translation and referential relation of gavagai, but, in fact, there is not even a correct answer to this question.Loux (2006), p. 274ff. To make sense of the word gavagai either way, the linguist simply has to assume that the native speaker does not refer to complicated terms like rabbits-tropes.Loar, Reed: inscrutability of reference. The finding, then, that gavagai means rabbit is not really a translation, but merely a common sense interpretation. It is important to note that indeterminacy and inscrutability not only occur in the course of translating something from a native, unknown language into a familiar one, but among every language. This holds also for languages which are quite similar, like German and Dutch, and even for speakers of the same language. One cannot with certainty say, what exactly his/her conversational partner refers to, when that person is talking about a rabbit. We commonly use the homophonic rule in those cases, i.e., if one utters rabbit, we assume s/he uses it in the same way we do. But, as has been shown, there are multiple possibilities which can be indistinguishable from one another.Swoyer (2003) This also applies in our own case. We ourselves do not know what it is we are referring to in using the word rabbit, that is because there is, in Quine's word, no fact of the matter at all. One must not, however, use different possible referential objects in the same translation, because they are incommensurable and the resulting translation hypothesis would contain logical fallacies.  Anti-realist interpretation  Hilary Putnam uses Quine's thesis about the inscrutability of reference to challenge the traditional Realist's view that there is a mind-independent world to which our propositional attitudes refer (e.g. when we talk about or think of something, these things exist not in our minds, but in said mind-independent world). This traditional view implies a correspondence theory of truth and might simply be called Realism about Being. While Michael Dummett already tried to show that the correspondence theory fails to obtain in some particular cases, Hilary Putnam is far more radical, for he claims that this theory fails in every case it is tried to be applied. On Putnam's account, the idea that we refer with our sentences and statements to a mind-independent, nonlinguistic world is an illusion. Further he claims that the problem to deal with is a language philosophical one and uses Quine's inscrutability of reference theory to clarify his point of view. He suggests, that, because the referential objects of a language are always inscrutable, the Realist's idea of a mind-independent world is fallacious, because it presupposes distinct referential relations from language to objects in the mind-independent world.Loux (2006), p. 272ff.  Application in the sorites paradox  The inscrutability of reference is also used in the sorites paradox. The classic example for the sorites paradox mentions a heap of wheat grains from which grains are taken away one by one, until at one time there's only a single grain left. This raises the question of where the line is to be drawn concerning what constitutes a heap. How long does the heap remain a heap? Are two grains still a heap? When one is talking about a heap, one obviously lacks any proper definition of it ready at hand. The referential object of heap is inscrutable, in the sense that there is no such thing and it is not even necessary for the use of the term heap.Hyde, Dominic: Sorites Paradox. In: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, January 17, 1997.

It was built from 1879 to 1883 at a cost of $627,148. Plans for the building had been made two decades prior to its construction. Originally it was to be a larger Gothic Revival structure, but the time and the costs of acquiring the land exceeded the original budget, and a smaller post office in the Italian Renaissance Revival style was erected instead. Note: This includes and Accompanying photograph Since 1977 it has been part of SUNY Plaza, and is used as offices by the central administration of the State University of New York (SUNY). Postal operations moved to larger facilities prior to 1972, but the building continued to house federal government offices for a few years. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is also a contributing property to the Downtown Albany Historic District, listed on the Register in 1980. Building The post office building is located on the east side of the three-way intersection of Broadway and State Street. An open, grassy plaza is located to the south; otherwise the surrounding neighborhood is densely developed with commercial buildings of a comparable or greater size. Many date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are, like the post office, contributing properties to the Downtown Albany Historic District. Some of its neighbors are also listed on the Register themselves. To the south a driveway curves around the plaza, around the front of the SUNY System Administration Building, listed on the Register as the Delaware and Hudson Railroad Company Building. Across Broadway, on the northwest corner, is the 1902 First Trust Company Building, also listed. The Home Savings Bank Building, Albany's first skyscraper, is a block further west. On the north is another federal government office building; a parking garage serving the area is to the northwest. It is complemented by several small parking lots to the southwest and northwest. There is also open space in the form of small parks nearby, such as Maiden Lane Park a block to the north. The terrain is level, reflecting the proximity of the Hudson River, to the east. Interstate 787 and U.S. Route 9 are between the neighborhood and the river. To the west the land begins to slope up towards the state capitol and other state-government buildings around Lafayette Park a quarter-mile (500 m) in that direction. The building itself is faced in load-bearing granite walls. Its main block is three stories high and seven bays along Broadway by nine along State. At all four corners are towers, five stories on the northwest and four on the southwest. Restrained ornamentation on the facades, includes shields and stars representing the United States, the building's first owner. Most of the doors and windows are within round arches, some recessed. On the west, the main entrance pavilion has clustered columns and pilasters supporting its slightly projecting balustraded roof. At the third and (on the towers) fourth stories are belt courses of carved stone. The same material is also used on the cornices at the rooflines. All the roofs are clad in slate shingles. Between the towers, on the main block, are mansard roofs pierced by small lunette dormer windows and topped with an iron balustrade. The towers have peaked roofs with one small oculus and the same balustrade. with peaked roofs clad in slate shingles. Inside, the building has been extensively renovated for its current use. It contains of office space. History As the eastern terminus of the Erie Canal, an upper port on the Hudson River and a major rail junction, Albany had grown considerably over the course of the 19th century. Its economic activity required a significant presence of federal government agencies, and their needs had outgrown the city's available space. After the Civil War, the Treasury Department turned its attention and resources to upgrading its facilities in cities that, like Albany, had grown rapidly due to industrialization. In 1872, Congress passed legislation authorizing the construction of the new building. It was to be primarily a post office, but large enough for other government agencies to have offices in it. The city was required to acquire the land; the total cost of the project was limited to $350,000 ($ in modern dollars). Acquiring the site of the Exchange Building took more than half the available money. William A. Potter, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, had designed a large, elaborate building in the High Victorian Gothic mode, with polychromatic stone siding. The lot turned out to be too small for the building, so the property of an adjacent bank was purchased for $150,000. With more money now spent for the land than had been budgeted for the entire building, and nothing built, Congress appropriated an additional $5,000. Construction did not begin until 1879. By then, James G. Hill had become the Supervising Architect. To save money, he changed the design to the Renaissance Revival style, which he supposedly preferred, complementing its use on the state capitol up the hill to the west. Hill kept Potter's basic forms and massing, although he changed the exterior to the simpler, cheaper gray granite. Inside, he made similar cost-driven modifications to the layout. Despite these changes, the building's final construction cost upon its 1883 completion was around $620,000 ($ in modern dollars). In 1912 the building became part of an early urban redevelopment plan. The city's leadership had become concerned about congestion and decay downtown, especially near Water Street, where many visitors got their first impression of Albany. They hired Arnold W. Brunner, an architect and urban planner from New York, to resolve what he called \\"the tangle of mean streets and wretched buildings\\" on the waterfront. alt=A black and white photograph showing the post office tower in the middle of other buildings on one side of a street with tracks down the middle He observed that Albany, reflecting its origins as a 17th-century frontier outpost, had followed the pattern of European cities which had likewise developed during the Middle Ages, with long, narrow streets and densely clustered buildings. Those cities nevertheless often had at least one large open plaza. Brunner thus proposed that one be created downtown at the intersection of Broadway and State Street, through the construction of a long building angled back from the street. A small streetcar turnaround could be built around the edges. The plaza would be framed by other major private and public buildings, like the post office. It would be a small version of the \\"court of honor\\" espoused for urban centers by the contemporary City Beautiful movement. The Delaware and Hudson Railroad, a major presence in the city, built the desired building, designed by local architect Marcus T. Reynolds, in 1914. For the next 60 years the building continued to serve its original functions. In 1972 the post office and other federal agencies moved out, needing larger and newer space. The building sat empty for five years until it was acquired by SUNY, which immediately began renovating it to meet modern building codes and its own requirements. The $15 million project, which also included the more extensive renovation of the old Delaware and Hudson Building to the south, was completed the next year. The New York City architectural firm that oversaw the renovations received an energy conservation award from Owens Corning, the building insulation manufacturer.

It also helped turn American laborers into a unified political force.Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 4. . Founding The Mechanic's Free Press was founded as a result of the beginning of the American labor movement in 1827. That year in Philadelphia, representatives from fifteen trades formed the Mechanics' Union of Trade Associations, which was created to change what the founders saw as the historical lack of political control for poor workers. The Mechanic's Free Press was founded in April 1828 with the goal of spreading the union's pro- labor message to communities across the country. The paper reached a circulation of 2,000, half the circulation of the largest New York City newspaper at that time. The paper's editor and founder, William Heighton, was an English-born shoemaker. He told readers the Mechanic's Free Press was meant to \\"raise the productive classes to that condition of true independence and equality which their practical skill and ingenuity, their immense utility to the nation, and their growing intelligence demand.\\" He called the working people the \\"blood, bone, sinew of the nation.\\" He also invoked Biblical references to make his points, comparing industrialists of the day to money changers who should be driven away \\"from the temple of freedom.\\" Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 6. . Heighton quit his job as a factory worker at the age of 28 and used his small savings to purchase a printing press.Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 8. . The newspaper itself was a four-page publication that ran ads for clothing and blacksmith services. Advocacy The Mechanic's Free Press advocated for several causes that its founders thought would improve the lives of factory workers. The newspaper advocacy goals included securing a ten-hour workday, curbing child labor, creating tax-supported public schools, and abolishing imprisonment as a punishment for debt.Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 9-15. . The first of those goals, securing a ten-hour workday for all workers, was meant to help children receive a better education and give workers enough time to become informed citizens. Workers at the time labored from before sunrise to after sunset, leaving little time to study or enjoy the outdoors. As a former child laborer, Heighton felt that the \\"sun to sun\\" work schedule prevented workers from becoming informed and questioning their circumstances. Heighton wrote that, as long as the schedule was intact, factory bosses would continue \\"perpetuating amongst us invidious and artificial class distinctions, unnatural and unjust inequalities.\\"Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 10. . To combat child labor, Heighton in 1830 published the first study linking child labor with illiteracy. According to the study, five out of every six child factory workers could not read or write their own names.Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 10-11. . Heighton also wrote editorials to protest the lack of child labor laws at the time. Heighton considered securing an education for all children to be the \\"first and most important\\" mission of the Mechanic's Free Press. The newspaper wrote editorials supporting universal education and Heighton himself wrote and submitted two bills to the Pennsylvania state legislature that called for universal education.Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 12. . To fight for the abolition of imprisonment as a penalty for debt, Heighton once again wrote editorials and submitted a bill to the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The newspaper's editorials said debt imprisonment, which was a common punishment at the time, was consummate to making poverty itself a crime.Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 14. . Political impact The Mechanic's Free Press was one of the main drivers behind the politicization of American laborers. Heighton said the established government served the wealthy elite while ignoring the poor. After founding the paper, Heighton called on workers to establish their own political party. The Working Men's Party was founded soon after with the Mechanic's Free Press as its official voice. Voters elected twenty-one of the party's members as officials to local offices in Philadelphia in the fall of 1828. They elected another twenty of the party's candidates to local offices the following year.Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 16. . The paper's political success was acknowledged by one of the mainstream newspapers, which typically treated the nascent labor press with hostility and disdain. The Free Trade Advocate, a New York City newspaper, said the Mechanic's Free Press had achieved two lofty goals: circulating to more than 2,000 subscribers every week and creating an environment in which the workers held \\"the balance of the power.\\"Heighton, William. \\"Addresses of the Committee appointed by the Working Men's Republican Association of Southwark,\\" Mechanic's Free Press, 31 October 1829, 3; quoted in Commons et al, History of Labour, vol. 1, 205. The labor movement was spurred on by the successes in Pennsylvania and expanded into New York State. The Mechanic's Free Press began circulating as far west as Ohio. Legacy Although the Working Men's Party ceased to exist in 1832 and the Mechanic's Free Press ended publication in 1831, the paper achieved some its goals. A mandatory ten-hour work day was established in Philadelphia by 1831, and the Pennsylvania state legislature adopted the state's first child labor laws in 1832.Streitmatter, Rodger (2001). Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 19. . In 1834, that state enacted laws creating tax-funded schools.

Written by poet Matthias Claudius, \\"Wir pfl√ºgen und wir streuen\\" was published in 1782 and set to music in 1800 attributed to Johann A. P. Schulz. It was translated into English by Jane Montgomery Campbell in 1861. It appears in a shortened form in the musical Godspell, as the song, \\"All Good Gifts\\". It is amongst the most performed of hymns in the United Kingdom.  History  =Origins= In 1777, Matthias Claudius had become ill and returned to Christianity after leaving it in his 20s. During his illness he wrote a number of poems. In 1782, a friend invited him over for dinner and asked him to bring one of the Christian poems he had written. Claudius wrote \\"Wir pfl√ºgen und wir streuen\\" based on Psalm 144 for this occasion with 17 verses. The poem was then published in \\"Asinus omnia sua secum portans\\" as a peasant's song. From there, it was published across Germany in number of hymnbooks. The majority of these cut down on the original 17 verses with the publishers often deciding to start with the 3rd verse which started with \\"Wir pfl√ºgen und wir streuen\\" (English: We Plough The Fields And Scatter). = English translation = In 1862 in England, Jane Montgomery Campbell, who was proficient in the German language, started to translate a number of German hymns into English. She translated \\"Wir pfl√ºgen und wir streuen\\" into English as \\"We Plough the Fields and Scatter\\"; however, she did not make a strict translation from the original German but ensured retention of the hymn's original focus of giving thanks to God for the harvest. She taught the hymn to the children at the Church of England parish school in London where her father was the rector. The hymn was later published in Charles Bere's Garland of Songs and Children's Chorale Book. Johann Abraham Peter Schulz  Usage  The hymn is predominantly used as a hymn to give thanks to God for the harvest and it has also been used in the United States as a hymn for Thanksgiving. The hymn has also been referenced in popular culture. In 1969, future Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, John Betjeman parodied the hymn as \\"We spray the fields and scatter/the poison on the land\\" published in Harvest Times as a protest against modern farming methods and new planning legislation. \\"We Plough The fields and Scatter\\" has also had a number of unofficial updated verses for it. An anonymous revised first verse which alluded to Betjeman's parody was published titled \\"We Plough the Fields with tractors\\". This verse, however, has been criticised as banal as it would not reference the history of the harvest. Lyrics Lyrics as published in 1861 in A Garland of Songs: > We plough the fields, and scatter the good seed on the land; > But it is fed and watered by God's almighty hand: > He sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain, > The breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain. Chorus All good > gifts around us > Are sent from heaven above, > Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord > For all His love. He only is the maker of all things near and far; > He paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star; > The winds and waves obey Him, by Him the birds are fed; > Much more to us, His children, He gives our daily bread. Chorus > We thank Thee, then, O Father, for all things bright and good, > The seed time and the harvest, our life, our health, and food; > No gifts have we to offer, for all Thy love imparts, > But that which Thou desirest, our humble, thankful hearts. Chorus > Verse 3 was revised to make it better suited to the harvest in Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1868 Appendix: > We thank Thee, then, O Father, for all things bright and good, > The seed time and the harvest, our life, our health, and food; > Accept the gifts we offer, for all Thy love imparts, > But what Thou most desirest, our humble, thankful hearts.

Early life Kudlich was born in √övalno Lobenstein near Opava, the Czech Republic (which was a part of the Austrian Empire at that time) on October 23, 1823 in to a peasant family. Political life Hans Kudlich, ca. 1880He is noted for being a leader of the revolutionary movement to end the feudal policies of the Austrian Empire under Ferdinand I of Austria. From the 1700s, the empire had enforced a decree known as the Robot Patent which required farmers to serve an annual quota of labor without compensation to the noble landowners. Kudlich was elected to the Austrian Reichstag (parliament) in early 1848 at the age of 25. He introduced a bill to abolish forced servitude and the bill was approved by the legislature. He was popularly titled as the ', meaning the liberator of peasant farmers from the involuntary servitude of serfdom. The parliament was dissolved by force on March 7, 1849 when the rebellion that had briefly taken control of Vienna was crushed. Kudlich up to the time of the dissolution of the parliament had worked to rally support for the revolution. After the dissolution of the parliament he fled first to Germany and then to Switzerland. After his political career, Kudlich obtained a medical degree in Berne and Zurich. He left Switzerland in 1853, emigrated to the United States, and settled in Hoboken, New Jersey.New York Times obituary, November 11, 1917.

The deployment followed the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord between India and Sri Lanka of 1987 which was intended to end the Sri Lankan Civil War between militant Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists, principally the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and the Sri Lankan military. The original intention was the Indian Peace Keeping Force would not be involved in large scale military operations. However, after a few months, the Indian Peace Keeping Force engaged the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in a series of battles. During the two years in which it was deployed, the IPKF fought numerous battles against the LTTE. The IPKF began withdrawing in 1989, and completed the withdrawal in 1990. Background According to Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy, Indian intervention in Sri Lankan civil war became inevitable as that civil war threatened India‚Äôs \\"unity, national interest and territorial integrity.\\" According to Laskar, this threat came in two ways: On the one hand external powers could take advantage of the situation to establish their base in Sri Lanka thus posing a threat to India, and on the other, the LTTE‚Äôs dream of a sovereign Tamil Eelam comprising all the Tamil inhabited areas (of Sri Lanka and India) posed a threat to India‚Äôs territorial integrity. The LTTE and other Tamil militant groups developed strong relationships with political parties in South India, such as Pure Tamil Movement (led by Perunchithiranar), Dravidar Kazhagam (led by K. Veeramani), Kamaraj Congress (led by Nedumaran) during the late 1970s. These Tamil parties firmly backed the militants' cause of creating a separate Tamil Eelam within Sri Lanka. Thereafter, LTTE developed relations with M. G. Ramachandran and M. Karunanidhi, who served as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, succeeding one another. Although Sri Lanka was a key member of Non-Aligned Movement in its initial stages, the Government of Sri Lanka's policies became pro-western as J. R. Jayewardene was elected prime minister with his landslide victory in 1977 parliamentary election. Subsequently, he introduced a new constitution and Open economy to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is the first South-Asian country to adopt Liberal open economy. Moreover, President J. R. Jayawardene did not enjoy the same warm relationship with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that he had enjoyed with her father, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Thus, with the outbreak of Black July ethnic riots, the Indian government decided to support the insurgent groups operating in Northern Sri Lanka. From mid 1983, on the instructions of Indira Gandhi, RAW began funding, arming and training several Tamil insurgent groups. Operation Poomalai India became more actively involved in the late 1980s, and on 5 June 1987, the Indian Air Force airdropped food parcels to Jaffna while it was under siege by Sri Lankan forces. At a time when the Sri Lankan government stated they were close to defeating the LTTE, India dropped 25 tons of food and medicine by parachute into areas held by the LTTE in a direct move of support toward the rebels. Further Sri Lanka government accused, that not only food and medicine but weapons were also supplied to the LTTE. Negotiations were held, and the Indo- Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed on 29 July 1987, by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Jayewardene. Under this accord, the Sri Lankan Government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, including a devolution of power to the provinces, a merger‚Äîsubject to later referendum‚Äîof the Northern and the Eastern provinces into the single province, and official status for the Tamil language (this was enacted as the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka). India agreed to establish order in the North and East through a force dubbed the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), and to cease assisting Tamil insurgents. Militant groups including the LTTE, although initially reluctant, agreed to surrender their arms to the IPKF, which initially oversaw a cease-fire and a modest disarmament of the militant groups. The signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord, so soon after JR Jayawardene's declaration that he would fight the Indians to the last bullet, led to unrest in south. The arrival of the IPKF to take over control of most areas in the North of the country enabled the Sri Lanka government to shift its forces to the south (in Indian aircraft) to quell the protests. This led to an uprising by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in the south, which was put down bloodily over the next two years. Conflict with the LTTE While most Tamil militant groups laid down their weapons and agreed to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict, the LTTE refused to disarm its fighters. Keen to ensure the success of the accord, the IPKF then tried to demobilize the LTTE by force and ended up in full-scale conflict with them. The three-year-long conflict was also marked by the IPKF being accused of committing various abuses of human rights by many human rights groups as well as some within the Indian media. The IPKF also soon met stiff opposition from the Tamils.Balasingham, Adele. (2003) The Will to Freedom - An Inside View of Tamil Resistance. Fairmax Publishing Ltd, 2nd ed. .NorthEast Secretariat report on Human rights 1974 - 2004 (see Further Reading section). =Operation Pawan= Operation Pawan was the codename assigned to the operations by the Indian Peace Keeping Force to take control of Jaffna from the LTTE in late 1987 to enforce the disarmament of the LTTE as a part of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord. In brutal fighting that took about three weeks, the IPKF wrested control of the Jaffna Peninsula from LTTE rule, something that the Sri Lankan army had then tried and failed to achieve for several years. Supported by Indian Army tanks, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, the IPKF routed the LTTE. The IPKF lost around 214 soldiers in this operation.Operation Pawan. The Battle for Jaffna =The Jaffna University Helidrop= The Jaffna University Helidrop was the first of the operations launched by the Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF) aimed at disarming the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) by force and securing the town of Jaffna, Sri Lanka, in the opening stages of Operation Pawan during the active Indian mediation in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Mounted on the midnight of 12 October 1987, the operation was planned as a fast heliborne assault involving Mi-8s of the No.109 HU, the 10th Para Commandos and a contingent of the 13th Sikh LI. The aim of the operation was to capture the LTTE leadership at Jaffna University building which served as the Tactical Headquarters of the LTTE, which was expected to shorten Operation Pawan, the battle for Jaffna. However, the operation ended disastrously, failing to capture its objectives -owing to intelligence and planning failures. The helidropped force suffered significant casualties, with nearly the entire Sikh LI detachment of twenty nine troops falling to the heavy fortifications of the university and fighting until death, along with six Paracommandos falling in battle. End of Indian involvement Nationalist sentiment led many Sinhalese to oppose the continued Indian presence in Sri Lanka. These led to the Sri Lankan government's call for India to quit the island, and they allegedly entered into a secret deal with the LTTE that culminated in a ceasefire. But the LTTE and IPKF continued to have frequent hostilities. In April 1989, the Ranasinghe Premadasa government ordered the Sri Lanka Army to clandestinely hand over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy Tamil National Army (TNA).Dissanayaka, T.D.S.A.: \\"War or Peace in Sri Lanka, Volume II\\", p. 332. Swastika, 1998. Although casualties among the IPKF mounted, and calls for the withdrawal of the IPKF from both sides of the Sri Lankan conflict grew, Rajiv Gandhi refused to remove the IPKF from Sri Lanka. However, following his defeat in Indian parliamentary elections in December 1989, the new prime Minister V. P. Singh ordered the withdrawal of the IPKF, and their last ship left Sri Lanka on 24 March 1990. The 32-month presence of the IPKF in Sri Lanka resulted in the deaths of 1200 Indian soldiers and over 5000 Sri Lankans. The cost for the Indian government was estimated at over ‚Çπ10.3 billion. =Rajiv Gandhi's assassination= Support for the LTTE in India dropped considerably in 1991, after the assassination of ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by a female suicide bomber named Thenmozhi Rajaratnam. The Indian press has subsequently reported that Prabhakaran decided to eliminate Gandhi as he considered the ex-Prime Minister to be against the Tamil liberation struggle and feared that he might re-induct the IPKF, which Prabhakaran termed the \\"satanic force\\", if he won the 1991 Indian general election. In 1998 a court in India presided over by Special Judge V. Navaneetham found the LTTE and its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran responsible for the assassination. In a 2006 interview, LTTE ideologue Anton Balasingham stated regret over the assassination, although he stopped short of outright acceptance of responsibility for it. India remained an outside observer of the conflict, after the assassination. References Further reading * Gunaratna, Rohan. (1997).

They had been initially linked with purchasing an old BMW Sauber chassis, but were later linked with Toyota and using the TF110. The idea was that using the Toyota would mean no team gained an unfair data advantage.Pirelli could use Toyota TF110 for F1 tyre testing in 2010 However eventually Pirelli decided to use the 2009 Toyota TF109 for their testing with Nick Heidfeld at the wheel. Chassis purchase attempts Various teams attempted to purchase the Toyota TF110 chassis for use in Formula One. The first attempt at using the car came from Serbian-based outfit Stefan GP. The team, led by Zoran Stefanoviƒá bought into the old Toyota F1 project for their technical knowledge. The team had hoped to purchase the TF110s to use in the 2010 season. One of the TF110s was painted red, and fired up for the first time on February 19. The team had intended to launch and test its car on 25 February regardless of whether or not its application to the grid was successful. The test was scheduled to take place at Portimao, with Kazuki Nakajima at the wheel. However Stefan GP were refused entry to race in F1, and never given official F1 specification tyres by Bridgestone. Hispania Racing, already in F1 considered buying the chassis following their split with car designers Dallara. Their boss Jose Ramon Carabante made several visits to Cologne but never sealed a deal to buy. Durango also considered purchasing the units for use in the 2011 Formula One season but they were not given an entry slot for the season.Durango Considering TF110 car for 2011 References External links *Images of the Toyota TF110 In Portuguese Toyota Formula One cars Formula One cars that never raced ","title":"Toyota TF110"},{"id":"29043119","text":"Wilhelm Henning (born 26 July 1879 in Bruchsal, Baden - death unknown) was a German military officer and right-wing politician.

Henning continued to represent this group (as well as the National Socialist Freedom Movement, a joint list with the Nazi Party active after the Beer Hall Putsch) in the Reichstag until 1928. Later years During the struggles for the leadership of the V√∂lkisch movement between the DVFP and the Nazis Henning had been a strong critic of Adolf Hitler and had denounced him as \\"not a politician\\".Ian Kershaw, Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris, Penguin Books, 1998, p. 263 Despite this he would go one to serve as a Nazi Party member after the collapse of the DVFP.

It was founded at California State University, Los Angeles in December 1960 and now has expanded to two other universities within Southern California since then. The sorority is centered on academics, service, and most importantly sisterhood. History *Alpha chapter Eight women students at California State University at Los Angeles established Kappa Zeta Phi in December 1960. It was in May 1962 that the sorority received its charter and was thus recognized on campus as a service and social sorority by the Inter-Organizational Council. *Beta chapter The Beta chapter of Kappa Zeta Phi Sorority at the University of California, Irvine, was colonized by five founding members on November 1, 1989. Ten Charter Members joined these five founding members and through their friendship, leadership, and vision, the formation of a new Asian-American Sorority was established at the UC Irvine campus. By working closely with the CSULA Kappa Zeta Phi, Alpha chapter, the Beta chapter Charter was bestowed upon the UC Irvine Charter Class on January 13, 1990. It is now a member of the Asian Greek Council (AGC) of Southern California. *Gamma chapter Kappa Zeta Phi, Gamma chapter, was founded by eleven dedicated women on April 25, 1994, at the University of California, San Diego. It now exists as an Asian- American interest sorority that promotes tradition, respect, and most importantly, sisterhood. In addition to working to build a social network among fellow Greek organizations, Kappa Zeta Phi also prioritizes community service above many other activities. Our sorority strives to build a strong relationship among women who are dedicated to enhancing themselves, regardless of ethnicity, in areas of academics, social life, community service, and personal achievement. Three very close-knit chapters of Kappas currently exist in Southern California. Alpha chapter resides in Los Angeles, Beta chapter in Irvine, and Gamma chapter in San Diego. Involvement on Campus Beta chapter The UCI Beta chapter of Kappa Zeta Phi is part of the Southern California Asian Greek Council(AGC) as well as the Multicultural Greek Council(MGC) on campus. UCI Beta chapter strives on being both a service and social sorority. They participate in annual philanthropies such as the A3M Bone Marrow Drive and the L.A. Chinese New Years Festival. Annually, UCI Kappa Zeta Phi participates in the Southern California Asian Greek Council's talent show competition where they partner with the brothers of Lambda Theta Delta competing for the grand prize.

This battalion has a logistical role in the Estonian Defence Forces along with Combat Service Support Battalions of the Infantry Brigades of Estonian Land Forces. ¬ß8 . History The modern Logistics Battalion of Estonia considers itself to be a continuation of the Auto-Tank Regiment of the interwar era. The Auto-Tank Regiment, which brought together the Estonian Army's armored cars and light tanks, was established under the leadership of Albert Ojassoni, on 9 April 1919. In 1923 there were various formed motorized military units which coalesced around the car-tank division of 1928. The task of modernizing this military unit fell to Colonel Jan Lutsar, who was the commander until 1934. The regiment was located in Tallinn, but his subordinate units were at various times in Valga, J√µhvis, Narva, Tapa, and Elvas.History of the Logistics Battalion On 17 July 1940, The Red Army occupied Estonia. On 1 October, the 1940 Auto-Tank Regiment structure was dissolved by the Soviet authorities, and its engineering duties distributed. The Red Army take-over was not able to organize its medical equipment; then later the majority of the German occupying forces received some service from the medical equipment branch of this regiment. In 1992 an act of the Estonian Defence Forces during the summer was to create: Automobile Company. In 1997 the: Defence Forces Motor Company was formed around the logistical units (battalions) in the rear areas. Then in 2002 the: Defence Logistics Battalion was formed, which was later amended, in 2005 to: Combat service support of the Defence Logistics Training Centre. From 2009 this structure bears the name of the entity: Logistics Battalion. In 2015 the Battalion was moved from barracks in Marja Street, Tallinn, to two modern barracks near the √Ñmari Air Base. Role The Logistics Battalion's main functions are to provide specialist training for the logistics units, to execute logistical tasks and military operations during wartime, to prepare the reserve units and to provide military assistance to the active units on the battlefield when in combat. In addition to these tasks, the battalion also supports and participates in the international military operations undertaken by the Estonian Armed Forces. It is responsible for the logistical support units, preparing any deployed elements for out-of-country or overseas operation, their departure and sustainability. In addition, the Logistics Battalion is tasked with ensuring the on-going preparedness of the Defence Forces Logistics Center. The Logistics Battalion also works in close cooperation with the Combat Service Support (CSS) Battalion of 1st Infantry Brigade and Combat Service Support (CSS) Battalion of 2nd Infantry Brigade. =Structure= The Logistics Battalion structure: *Battalion Staff *Headquarters Company *Logistics Company *Rear Company It is important to note that 250 conscripts serve in the Logistics Battalion every year. =Symbols and flags= The Logistics Battalion emblem is a winged fire-bursting dragon on a violet shield, which is a symbol of strength and speed. It was once the Auto-Tank Regiment insignia. The symbol was re-adopted by the Defence Forces Automobile Company in 1996. The Defence Forces officially established the Defence Logistics Battalion badge on 13 March 1996. This Badge was originally designed as a sign of professionalism, technical excellence and teaching capability. Today, the badge is given in recognition of outstanding and exemplary service in the Defence Logistics Battalion. As you can see from the history given above, this badge over time has carried many names up to: Department of Defence Forces General Headquarters of the Company. It is also called today by its historic name: Car Company badge. Military staff who have served in the Defence Logistics Battalion at least two years may be awarded the right to carry the badge. According to the statutes this badge may also be provided to supervisors rendering commendable service to the Defence Logistics Battalion who served at least three years, as well as conscripts who have proven their professional ambition, and for good academic performance.

Repowering can happen in several different ways. It can be as small as switching out and replacing a boiler, to as large as replacing the entire system to create a more powerful system entirely. There are many upsides to repowering. The simple act of refurbishing the old with the new is in itself beneficial alongside the cost reduction for keeping the plant running. With less costs and a higher energy output, the process is excessively beneficial. Examples =Wind power= Repowering a wind farm means replacing older, generally smaller, wind turbines with newer, generally larger, and more efficient designs. New innovations in wind power technology have dramatically increased the power output of new turbines compared with older designs. By repowering old wind turbines with new upgrades, the increased size and efficiency of the new turbines will increase the amount of energy that can be generated from a given wind farm. In the United States in 2017, 2131 MW of wind plant repowering was completed. According to a study in California the potential benefits of repowering wind plants by replacing old turbines are: *Avian mortality may be reduced due to the installation of a smaller number of larger wind turbines. *Reduced aesthetic concerns to the extent that modern wind projects are deemed more visually appealing, even if they are taller. *‚ÄúIncreased renewable energy production due to the higher average capacity factors typical of new wind facilities.‚Äù *Use of existing infrastructure (for example, roads, substations), resulting in lower installation costs relative to new ‚Äúgreenfield‚Äù wind power projects. *‚ÄúUse of newer wind turbine technology that can better support the electrical grid with better power quality.‚Äù *Increased local and state tax base, plus positive construction employment opportunities. Countries like Germany and Denmark that have a large number of wind turbines installed relative to their total land size have resorted to repowering older turbines in order to increase wind power capacity and generation. The power as well as use of wind farms has grown since the 1990s. California has many aging wind turbines that would be effective to repower, but there seems to be a lack of economic incentive to repower many sites. Many smaller turbines in California were built in the 1980s with a nameplate capacity of 50-100 kW, which is 10-40x smaller than the nameplate capacity of an average modern wind turbine. Although many barriers continue to hinder rapid wind‚Äêproject repowering, a primary barrier is simply that many existing, aging wind facilities are more profitable, in the near term, in continued operations than they might be if they pursue repowering with new wind turbines.California Energy Commission. (2006). Application for certification, Humboldt Bay Repowering Project. San Francisco, Calif.]: CH2M Hill. http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-300-2008-004/CEC-300-2008-004.PDF By 2007, California had repowered 365 MW of wind plants, which is only 20% of the potential 1,640 MW wind capacity that could be upgraded. =Coal-fired Power Plant to Gas= With new environmental regulation in the United States, coal-fired power plants are becoming obsolete. As many as three-fourths of coal-fired power plants are being shut down. Short-term options include retiring the plant or quick conversion to direct firing of the boiler with natural gas. Repowering these old coal burning power plants into gas burning boilers. It's estimated that as much as 30 gigawatts (GW) of existing U.S. power generation capacity could be lost through plant closings due to new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. There could be a saving of 20 percent of the capital cost instead of building brand new power plants founded by EPRI studied. The configuration of these plants involves replacing the old coal boiler with gas-fired turbine (GT). The gas-fired outputs exhaust heat to a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). From the output of the heat recovery steam generator it is run into a steam turbine which increases electricity production and the overall efficiency of the plant. The gas-fired turbine (GT) and the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) technology has been in utilize in many repowering projects over the past 20 years in the United States alone. With increasing environmental regulations of the United States Government and the lower fuel prices made the usage of GT/HRSG an option in utilizing to renew many old coal heating power plants. This modern gas turbines operate with higher efficiencies and adding a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) raises overall plant efficiency to 40 percent to 50 percent (HHV) above the range of most coal-fired plants, reducing fuel consumption and lowering plant emissions. Siemens Corporation are also using this technology by combining the gas turbine (GT) in conjunction with the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) with the steam turbine (ST) and the combined cycle power plants to produce the most efficient power generation facilities. Existing direct-fired plants can utilize this advanced cycle concept by adding a GT and a HRSG. This so-called repowering scheme makes the existing power generation facility equally efficient as modern combined cycle power plant. Siemens Corporation developed two ways in powering these old coal plants. The first one is called a Full Powering and the second is called Parallel Powering. Full Powering is only used with old plants because the boilers has reached the life of its usage. Full powering replaces the original boiler and gas-turbine (GT) and heat recovery steam generator are added (HRSG). While compared to the full repowering concept, this repowering scheme achieves slightly lower efficiency. Due to the two independent steam sources for the steam turbine, this concept provides a higher fuel flexibility and also greater flexibility in respect to load variations. An example of a repowering project is of Fluor updating the Seward plant.The plant was a 521-MW coal-fired power plant. The plant burns waste coal. The project was to take three existing pulverized coal-fired boilers out and install two new Clean Coal Technology CFB boilers with major changes such as installing two Alstom CFB boilers along with an Alstom steam turbine generator. This plant is now the largest waste coal generator in the world with a capacity of 521-MW of capacity. It runs on 11,000 tons of waste coal per day.

It has most prominently been utilised, often alongside Article 8 of the Convention, to challenge the denial of same sex marriage in the domestic law of a Contracting state. Text Application As a right contained in the ECHR, Article 12 is available to anyone within the jurisdiction of a Council of Europe member state,, Council of Europe page on Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. otherwise considered as a contracting party to the Convention. The right contained in Article 12 is closely related to Article 8 of the Convention, which secures a right to respect for one's \\"private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\\", European Convention on Human Rights. Article 12 has not been as widely used as Article 8 in arguments for rights regarding family and relationships, but it has played in a role in counter-arguments to sham marriage accusations and it is playing a growing role in challenges to laws regarding same-sex unions.1 Crown Office Row, Article 12 - Right to marry/found family, UK Human Rights Blog Because Article 8 has been a reliable source for claims relating to family, relationships and home, jurisprudence on Article 12 has been left fairly thin., UK Human Rights Blog on Article 12. Similar provisions exist in a number of other International human rights documents. The ECHR was the first instrument to give effect to certain rights stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and made them binding within Europe,, European Court of Human Rights page on The European Convention on Human Rights. so as expected, Article 16(1) of the UDHR contains a similar provision:, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 16 > Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality > or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) also guarantees that the right to marry will be recognised in Article 23(2):, International Covenant On Civil and Political Rights, Article 23. > The right of men and women of marriageable age to marry and to found a > family shall be recognized. =The principle of subsidiarity= Protocol No. 15, not yet in force, introduces specific reference to the principle of subsidiarity in the Preamble of the Convention., Council of Europe Page on Amendments to the Convention.

Other legal origins of the principle of subsidiarity in the ECHR have been found in Article 1 (obligation to respect human rights), 13 (right to an effective remedy), 19 (establishment of the Court) and 35(1)(admissibility criteria).Alastair Mowbray, \\"Subsidiarity and the European Convention on Human Rights\\", Human Rights Law Review, Vol. 15, No. 2 (Jun., 2015), pp.313-34, at 319-320. Mowbray has explained that the principle of subsidiarity is twin limbed.Alastair Mowbray, \\"Subsidiarity and the European Convention on Human Rights\\", Human Rights Law Review, Vol. 15, No. 2 (Jun., 2015), pp.313-34, at 321, citing Matscher and Petzold (eds), ‚ÄòThe Convention and the Principle of Subsidiarity‚Äô in Macdonald, Matscher and Petzold (eds), The European System for the Protection of Human Rights (1993) at 42. The first is the procedural limb requiring all domestic remedies to be exhausted before lodging complaints at Strasburg. The second in the substantive limb through which the Court limits its own ability to review a domestic authority‚Äôs decision.Alastair Mowbray, \\"Subsidiarity and the European Convention on Human Rights\\", Human Rights Law Review, Vol. 15, No. 2 (Jun., 2015), pp.313-34, at 321. The latter has three parts: first, the Court does not seek to supplant domestic courts' primary role in delivering interpretations of national law; second, where the Convention has placed a duty of specific conduct on the national authority; and third, through the Court‚Äôs creation of the margin of appreciation doctrine.Alastair Mowbray, \\"Subsidiarity and the European Convention on Human Rights\\", Human Rights Law Review, Vol. 15, No. 2 (Jun., 2015), pp.313-34, at 321. Mowbray argues that the doctrine is the product of subsidiarity: \\"it is a technique developed to allocate decision-making authority to the proper body in the Convention scheme to delineate in concrete cases the boundary between \\"primary\\" national discretion and the \\"subsidiary\\" international supervision.\\"Alastair Mowbray, \\"Subsidiarity and the European Convention on Human Rights\\", Human Rights Law Review, Vol. 15, No. 2 (Jun., 2015), pp.313-34, at 322 citing Matscher and Petzold (eds), ‚ÄòThe Convention and the Principle of Subsidiarity‚Äô in Macdonald, The European System for the Protection of Human Rights (1993) at 59. This understanding distinguishes subsidiarity and the doctrine of the margin of appreciation as two separate concepts. The right to marry as contained in Article 12 of the Convention could be considered a specific example of Mowbray‚Äôs understanding of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) application of the substantive limb of the principle of subsidiarity. First, \\"In order to avoid trespassing on a State's sovereignty, the Court will intervene only when it is absolutely necessary to do so.\\"Michael R. Hutchinson, \\"The Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the European Court of Human Rights\\", The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1999), pp.638-650, at 640. This discretion (to properly interpret Article 12 in the context of domestic norms) is not unlimited and goes hand- in-hand with European supervision through the court.See Handyside v. UK, E.Ct.H.R., Case Reports, 5493/72, 1976. Second, Article 12 places a specific duty of conduct on national authorities to uphold the right in the context of national laws governing marriage plainly by its wording. And finally, the right to marry has proven to be a right where the Court has developed a clear and wide margin of appreciation.See Christine Goodwin v. The United Kingdom, E.Ct.H.R., Case Reports, 28957/95, 2002.; Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010. =The doctrine of the margin of appreciation= The margin of appreciation (or margin of state discretion) is a fundamental part of the jurisprudence of the ECtHR in interpreting and applying the provisions of the ECHR. Similar to subsidiarity, it is not explicitly referred to in the Convention itself but is the product of the Strasbourg organs.Michael R. Hutchinson, \\"The Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the European Court of Human Rights\\", The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1999), pp.638-650, at 639. The task of the Strasbourg organs is to examine domestic interpretations of the Convention and decide whether they are compatible with the universality of the Convention‚Äôs normsMichael R. Hutchinson, \\"The Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the European Court of Human Rights\\", The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1999), pp.638-650, at 639, 640. and whether they should be sanctioned for derogations which \\"restrict the right in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired.\\"Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [49] . See for example B. and L. v. the United Kingdom, E.Ct.H.R., Case Reports, 36536/02, ¬ß 34, 2005 and F. v. Switzerland, E.Ct.H.R., Case reports, 11329/85, 1987. Therefore, the margin of appreciation can be better understood as \\"a matter of who takes the decisions, rather than what those decisions might be.\\"Michael R. Hutchinson, \\"The Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the European Court of Human Rights\\", The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1999), pp.638-650, at 640. Hutchinson explains that in practice the margin of appreciation as to a State's domestic implementation of Convention standards can become wider or narrower depending on the surrounding circumstances of the alleged breach being heard by the Court.Michael R. Hutchinson, \\"The Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the European Court of Human Rights\\", The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1999), pp.638-650, at 640. Derogations from the Convention ultimately rest on the concept of domestic necessity in Contracting State societies, and so a natural consequence becomes situation- oriented margins of appreciation. In respect of the ECHR a margin will be narrower where there is a substantial degree of European consensus among member states around acceptable limitations on a certain Convention right, and wider where there is no such consensus.Michael R. Hutchinson, \\"The Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the European Court of Human Rights\\", The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1999), pp.638-650, at 640. This has become particularly evident in the case of Article 12 and the right to marry, especially in relation to same-sex marriage. In more than one case, the Court has said that in relation to Article 12, Contracting states enjoy a \\"particularly wide\\" margin of appreciation in determining the measures necessary for Convention rights such as this one to be secured within their jurisdiction.Christine Goodwin v. The United Kingdom, E.Ct.H.R., Case Reports, 28957/95, 2002, ¬ß [85] ; Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [92]. Case law =Limitations on marriage found permissible= Schalk and Kopf v. Austria (2010)See Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010. Schalk and Kopf alleged discrimination because, being a same sex couple, they were denied the possibility to marry or to have their relationship recognised by law in Austrian domestic law. The applicants argued that civil marriage was a union of two persons encompassing all aspects of lives, and the procreation of children was no longer a decisive element to the union of marriage.See Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [44]. They considered the reference to ‚Äònational laws‚Äô in Article 12 of the Convention could not mean that states were given unlimited discretion in regulating that right.See Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [44]. Government maintained that both the clear wording of Article 12 and the Court‚Äôs case-law as it stood indicated that the right to marry was by its very nature limited to different sex couples.See Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [43]. Austrian Government conceded that there has been significant social changes in the institution of marriage since the adoption of the Convention, but there was not yet any European consensus on granting same sex couples the right to marry.See Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [43]. Having regard to Article 9 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Court no longer considered that the right to marry enshrined in Article 12 of the ECHR must in all circumstances be limited to marriage between two persons of the opposite sex.See Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [61]. Nevertheless, as matters stand, the question whether or not to allow same sex marriage is to be left to regulation by the national law of the Contracting State,See Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [61]. and no violation of Article 12 was found. The Court reasoned that the choice of the wording of Article 12 must be considered deliberate. The right was granted in the context of strictly traditional concepts of marriage and a lack of European consensus upheld the wide margin of discretion afforded to Contracting states.See Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [46], [55]. Parry v. the United Kingdom (2006);See Parry v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42971/05, ECHR 2006-XV.R and F v. the United Kingdom (2006)See R. and F. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 35748/05, 28 November 2006. In these two cases married couples being a woman and a male to female post-operative transsexual, made a complaint to the court that under Article 12 they were required to end their marriage if the second applicant wished to obtain full legal recognition of their change of gender to female.As discussed in Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [53]. These cases were dismissed as manifestly unfounded. Again, the Court referred to the traditional concept of marriage which Article 12 was founded in.As discussed in Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [53]. The Court acknowledged that a number of Contracting States had extended marriage to same sex couples but went on to say \\"this reflected their own vision of the role of marriage in their societies and did not flow from an interpretation of the fundamental right as laid down by the Contracting States in the Convention in 1950.\\"As discussed in Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [53]. It ultimately fell within the Contracting States margin of appreciation as to how to regulate the effects of the change of gender on pre-existing marriages,As discussed in Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, E.Ct.H.R, Case Reports, 30141/04, 2010, ¬ß [53]. and consequently Article 12 had not been violated in either of these cases. Rees v. the United Kingdom (1986);See Rees v. the United Kingdom, 17 October 1986, ¬ß¬ß 49-50, Series A no. 106. Cossey v. the United Kingdom (1990);See Cossey v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1990, ¬ß 46, Series A no. 184. Sheffield and Horsham v. the United Kingdom (1998)See Sheffield and Horsham v. the United Kingdom, 30 July 1998, ¬ß 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-V. In these cases the court found that the inability of transsexuals to marry a person of the sex opposite to their reassigned gender was not found by the Court to be in breach of Article 12.See Christine Goodwin v. The United Kingdom, E.Ct.H.R., Case Reports, 28957/95, 2002. ¬ß [97]. This was based on traditional concepts of marriage; the continued adoption of biological criteria in domestic law for determining a person‚Äôs sex; and, that such regulations in national laws could not be regarded as restricting the right in such a way that the very essence of the right was impaired.See Christine Goodwin v. The United Kingdom, E.Ct.H.R., Case Reports, 28957/95, 2002, ¬ß [97]. Klip and Kruger v.

Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom (2002) The Court departed from its historical reasoning against finding a breach of Article 12 of the Convention in this case. The transgender applicant argued that she and her partner could not marry because the law treated her as a man because of the biological criteria which determined gender for the purposes of marriage in domestic law.See Christine Goodwin v. The United Kingdom, E.Ct.H.R., Case Reports, 28957/95, 2002.See Corbett v. Corbett ([1971] Probate Reports 83; Bellinger v. Bellinger, EWCA Civ 1140 [2001], 3 FCR 1. The UK Government maintained that neither Article 12 of the Convention, nor the closely related Article 8, required a state to permit a transsexual or transgender person to marry a person of his or her original sex: \\"if any change in this important or sensitive area were to be made, it should come from the UK‚Äôs own courts acting within the margin of appreciation which this Court has always afforded.\\"See Christine Goodwin v. The United Kingdom, E.Ct.H.R., Case Reports, 28957/95, 2002, ¬ß [96]. The Court considered the terms of Article 12 which referred to the right of a \\"man and a woman\\" to marry no longer had to be understood as determining gender by purely biological criteria.See Christine Goodwin v.

Early years  Almur√≥ was born in Paris in 1927 and studied piano from an early age. In 1946, influenced by Surrealism and Ren√© Daumal, he founded a literary journal titled Les Cahiers Sensationnistes. In 1947, he joined Pierre Schaeffer's Club d'Essai on RTF (Radio T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise) as a radio producer.Liner notes from \\"L'Envol/Ambitus\\" LP, Disques BAM, France, 1963 [BAM or Bo√Æte √† Musique was a French record label created by Jacques L√©vi-Alvar√®s in the 1930s. The name was changed to Disques Alvar√®s in the 1970s] During the 1950s, he produced many radio plays based on French writers, with a preference for Surrealists like Andr√© Breton, Ren√© Char, Jean Cocteau, Antonin Artaud, Julien Gracq.Liner notes from Musiques Exp√©rimentales LP, Disques Ad√®s records, France, 1970  1950s  Almur√≥ used increasingly difficult and provocative texts for his radio plays, like Jean Genet's homoerotic poem Le Condamn√© √† Mort, for which Almur√≥ created electroacoustic music in 1952, or Antonin Artaud's Van Gogh, Le Suicid√© De La Soci√©t√© in 1958, a text written 1947, the same year as Pour en Finir avec le Jugement de Dieu [To Have Done With the Judgment of God], written for radio but withheld from broadcast by directors in 1948. In 1957, his meeting with 15-year-old Pierre Cl√©menti influenced Almur√≥ to start recording Cl√©menti's poetry readings and make him his assistant. Cl√©menti, born 1942, later became actor and film director, collaborating with Almur√≥ on several films.See Philippe Bresson's article on the Almur√≥/Cl√©menti friendship (in French) When Schaeffer founded his Groupe de Recherches Musicales in 1958, Almur√≥ joined as a member for several years, but soon launched his own, independent recording studio in the early 1960s. Here he produced incidental music and collaborations with other artists, like singer Colette Magny, with whom he published two LPs, Avec, 1966 and Bura Bura, 1967.From online Colette Magny discography.  Teacher and filmmaker  In 1973, Almur√≥ became a teacher at Paris' Sorbonne University (UFR d‚ÄôArts Plastiques, Facult√© Paris I Sorbonne). Other teachers included writer Dominique Noguez and contemporary artist Michel Journiac. Students included film maker St√©phane Marti and musicians Jean-Luc Guionnet and Eric Cordier. In 1976, he created a live performance titled Partition with French contemporary artist Ange Leccia, and founded the Son-Images-Corps performance group with students. His opera Close Up was premiered in Poitiers, France. In 1978 he directed his first film, Cort√®ge, with music by electroacoustic music composer and Almur√≥ student, Philippe Jubard.

The trademark element of his style was the almost clinical precision with which he dissected the psychologies and motivations of his characters. Biography Born as the son of a physician, Binet-Valmer initially also studied medicine, but later turned his attention towards writing novels and reviews. Although Binet-Valmer was not homosexual himself, several of his novels, particularly his most famous one, Lucien, deal with homosexual themes and characters. Lucien was by far Binet-Valmer's most successful book in France, getting released in no fewer than 22 printings between its first edition in 1910 and 1919. It also caused a minor scandal because of its‚Äîfor the time‚Äîrisqu√© discussion of homosexuality. Marcel Proust's opinion of Lucien was damning‚Äîhe wrote that it was the stupidest book he had ever read (le livre le plus imb√©cile que j'aie jamais lu). Other critics, such as Edmond Jaloux, had a far more favorable attitude towards the book. The ending of Lucien was very unusual for the time, because instead of having Lucien commit suicide (then considered more or less the standard ending for a novel with a homosexual protagonist), in the final paragraph Binet-Valmer lets him elope to Naples together with his boyfriend Reginald Green. As a journalist, Binet-Valmer wrote for magazines such as Mercure de France, Le Matin, and Revue de Paris. He also indirectly caused Proust to change the title of his magnum opus, In Search of Lost Time: Initially it was called Les Intermittences du c≈ìur, but when Proust learned that Binet-Valmer had published the novel Le C≈ìur en d√©sordre (1912), the name was changed to √Ä la recherche du temps perdu, with the former title making an appearance as a subtitle in the volume Sodome et Gomorrhe (1921/22). However, Proust later acknowledged in a letter to Jacques Boulenger, editor of L'Opinion, that \\"the whole press (except Binet-Valmer) deserted\\" him \\"about Sodome et Gomorrhe\\". Novelist Georges Simenon was an assistant to Binet-Valmer for a few months in late 1922 and used that encounter for episodes in two of his novels (Les Noces de Poitiers and Le Passage de la ligne). After the 1930s, Binet-Valmer fell into relative obscurity, especially compared to his contemporary Marcel Proust whose fame has eclipsed Binet-Valmer's ever since.

He founded the organisation Cardiff Start, which is aimed at promoting and growing new tech start-ups in the city, co-founded the TEDx Cardiff series, and is on the boards of Ffilm Cymru Wales and the Welsh Music Foundation.  Early life  Cocker grew up in Coventry, England. He studied Philosophy and Psychology at Cardiff University, graduating in 1996.  Music industry career  Cocker began his working life as a DJ and A&R.; In 2000, along with co-founders Maf Lewis and Steven Robson, Cocker established the breakbeat label Plastic Raygun. In 2007, he established the Network of Creative and Cultural Industries (initially named Pollen) aimed at providing UK-wide networking and discussion in the arts sector. His music career led to the publishing of a \\"top-ten hit\\", but Cocker then decided to move into the business world. In 2008 he became a co-organiser of Ignite Cardiff, a network of public speakers. He has served on the boards of Ffilm Cymru Wales and the Welsh Music Foundation. He co-founded TEDx Cardiff in 2010. In 2010 he was interviewed by Plastik Magazine about his work in the music business.  Start-up work  Due to his prior experience of the music industry, he first pursued a printing industry business. In 2009 he established Dizzyjam, an e-commerce merchandise product for independent businesses and artists in the music sector. His experience of difficulties in finding start-up funding and advice for RampTShirts in the Welsh capital led to his establishment of Cardiff Start, now the most prominent start-up community in Wales. The non-profit states that its goal is to promote young, creative figures in Cardiff, both for building connections between businesses and developers, as well as helping educate prospective new founders. He is regularly cited by the BBC, business publications, and local media, in discussions about the issues facing Welsh start-ups. He has particularly advocated for reforms by Cardiff Council and Welsh Government to reform data laws, in order to allow businesses and organisations to utilise open data more effectively. In 2014 his creation, a \\"happiness map\\" of Cardiff, was reported in the Western Mail and by WalesOnline. The site surveyed and visualised residents' experiences of noise, convenience, and safety, on an interactive heat map. In that same year, he was named on the UK Entrepreneurship Power 100 by Fresh Business Thinking Magazine. In 2015 Dizzyjam became Ramp Commerce Ltd, which was established by Cocker with his Bulgarian co-founder. He was unable to secure capital funding for the business, and as a result pursued accelerator programme support in London. The company, trading as RampTShirts, operates out of headquarters in Cardiff and also Sofia, Bulgaria, as well as having additional locations for printing and distribution across Europe and North America. Clients of the business have included Google, Virgin Media and MySpace. That year he was named in The Centre for Entrepreneurs 100 list. He spoke in 2015 as part of the University of Oxford Confessions of an Entrepreneur talks series, a series which aims to give \\"insight into the mindset of current entrepreneurs\\" including both the \\"highs and lows\\". In 2018 he received the Cardiff Business Awards \\"Outstanding Contribution to Cardiff\\". He was highlighted in 2018 by the Welsh Government's Business Wales forum in their \\"Big Ideas Wales\\" series.

It bordered the Marble Hill neighborhood. After the surrounding of Marble Hill was filled in and merged to the Bronx or the mainland, the space filled in became part of Kingsbridge. The velodrome was built on top of the new land that was available. The New York and Putnam Railroad stopped in front of it at the Kingsbridge Station (a building that still stands today). The Velodrome was one of the largest velodromes in the world. It became a popular destination for professional cyclist. Unfortunately, the velodrome was destroyed in a fire on August 4, 1930. Years later, different businesses were built on top of the site. Today, the parking garage and Target store section of the River Plaza (Shopping Mall) is present.

Webb, St. Paul, MN) The Golden Bowl is the first novel by Frederick Manfred (b.1912) published in 1944 under his birth name Feike Feikema. Manfred insisted on this title, which is identical to Henry James' better known novel, even when his friend Sinclair Lewis argued against it. The novel is set during the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma. It follows a few months in the life of Maury Grant, an itinerant farm boy whose family has been wiped out in the disaster. Grant becomes a reluctant hired hand at the Thor family farm in southwestern South Dakota, leaving them in despair of the hopelessness of their situation, returning a few weeks later and, Manfred implies, remaining. The last pages depict a \\"black blizzard\\" with gripping vividness. Manfred drew on his life experience to write the story. He grew up on an Iowa farm, then after graduating from college, he struck out to see the country, hoboing west to Yellowstone and back. The Golden Bowl is based on those adventures and his firsthand experience of the Dust Bowl. (Many years later, Manfred would write a memoir of his cross-country adventure, The Wind Blows Free.) The Golden Bowl has been in and out of print repeatedly, including a fiftieth-anniversary edition by the South Dakota Humanities Center. References  Robert C.

Background \\"Perfect Nightmare\\" was sent to UK urban radio in January 2011, where it was listed on the B-playlist. Critical reception So far, \\"Perfect Nightmare\\" has received positive reviews. Sara Anderson of AOL Radio Blog spoke highly of the song, stating, \\"Opening with a haunting piano melody, by 1:08 'Perfect Nightmare' turns into to [sic] poppy, club-driven anthem, as Shontelle struggles to break free from a damaging relationship.\\" Robbie Daw of Idolator said, \\"And while she can't seem to shake the pesky gent she describes in the tune, we're finding Shon's latest to be equally irresistible. It's certainly a step in the right direction for the 24-year-old, for whom Top 10 hit status in the U.S. has so far been elusive.\\" Music video The song's music video was directed by Colin Tilley and was released on September 30, 2010. It opens with Shontelle walking alone next to an old building before cutting to a black and white scene of her singing in darkness. A man is shown working out in a gym and footage is shown of Shontelle interacting with him after he is finished. In the next scene, Shontelle can be seen standing in front of bright yellow lights and four other woman, who begin to dance as the song's beat picks up. Between takes of Shontelle singing in front of these women, the man can again be seen working out but this time with a different woman. Next, Shontelle is shown entering the gym and crouching in front of a row of lockers, flailing around as she sings. In the final scene, a fight is taking place between the man and another boxer as the other woman watches. Shontelle is shown standing in front of a wall that separates the boxing ring from the locker room, and finally steps around the wall entering into plain sight of the man. He looks over at her, concerned, and as he does his opponent punches him in the head, knocking him down.

Released on March 22, 2005 by Prosthetic Records, it was produced by English record producer Alex Newport, who is known for his projects Fudge Tunnel and Nailbomb. Music and composition To Walk a Middle Course is a sludge metal, alternative metal and stoner rock album. The album features a variety of metal and non-metal influences, including from doom metal, stoner rock, punk rock and gothic rock. AllMusic critic Alex Henderson wrote: \\"Elements of Neurosis, Eyehategod, Orange Goblin, and Black Sabbath assert themselves, as do elements of the Melvins, Lydia Lunch, and X. In fact, Kylesa often employ the punky male vocals/punky female vocals contrast that worked so well for X in the '80s, although they're a much heavier band.\\" Blabbermouth.net's Keith Bergman stated that the band \\"are all about throwing murky riffs, bottom-of-a-well screams, and lugubrious rhythms into a dour punk stew that name-checks everyone from old Neurosis to Amebix to Eyehategod to Unsane.

AllMusic's Alex Henderson wrote: \\"Kylesa can be very dissonant, noisy, and discordant, but they aren't that way all the time; moments of sensory assault can easily be followed by passages that are moody, eerie, and darkly atmospheric.\\" Henderson further stated that the record \\"isn't as consistent as it could have been, but more often than not, Kylesa's risk-taking pays off on this intriguing, if uneven, effort.\\" Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net commented: \\"After a few tracks, Kylesa's zanily unpredictable mishmash of sound becomes‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ predictable.

Cardle was born in Southampton and grew up in Halstead, Essex. Cardle has been involved in music since his early teens and has been a member of two different bands; Darwyn and Seven Summers. Cardle rose to fame after winning the seventh series of The X Factor, and received a ¬£1 million recording contract with Syco Music and later signed a deal with Columbia Records. Following Cardle's victory on The X Factor, the winner's single and his debut single, \\"When We Collide\\", was released. The track was made available to purchase on 12 December 2010, shortly after the show had ended. On 19 December 2010, the track debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, as well as on the Irish Singles Chart. The track also became the second biggest-selling single of 2010 with 815,000 copies sold within two weeks. In June 2012, it had sold 1 million copies, the fourth single by an X Factor contestant to have done so. \\"Run for Your Life\\" was the follow-up single released by Cardle which charted at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. Cardle went on to release his debut album, Letters, in 2011, which debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and the Irish Albums Chart. The album saw two more singles released, \\"Starlight\\" and \\"Amazing\\". Cardle then parted ways with record labels Syco Music and Columbia Records, and signed a recording contract with So What Recordings in early 2012. He released his second studio album, The Fire, which charted at number eight on the UK Albums Chart. In October 2013, Cardle released his third album, Porcelain, in association with Absolute Marketing as an independent release. It reached number 11 on the UK Albums Chart. The lead single was a duet with Melanie C, called \\"Loving You\\", which was released on 18 August and reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart. Cardle is a guitarist, and plays frequently on tour and other performances. He also plays other instruments including drums and piano. He has toured the United Kingdom and Ireland on his Letters Tour in 2012, Unplugged Tour in 2013, Porcelain Tour in 2014 and Intimate and Live Tour in 2016. Cardle has combined album and single sales of over 2 million. Life and career =Early life and career beginnings= Cardle was raised in Halstead, Essex. Cardle was born in Southampton, Hampshire, to David and Jennifer Cardle (n√©e Horner) on 15 April 1983. He has an older brother called Dominic with whom he has a close relationship. His family lived in Bristol before moving to Essex. He started playing guitar and writing songs at aged 11 and knew from that point that music was what he wanted to do with his life. At this time he also started singing lessons but stopped going after missing a class. He attended a summer band camp through his teens and played in bands. He attended the independent Stoke College in Suffolk, then studied a music course at the Institute in Colchester. He then went on to do a media course at Braintree College. Cardle is a keen skateboarder and spent a lot of his college years at skate parks instead of studying and therefore felt that education wasn't the right path for him. When he was a young adult, he interviewed for a music course at Bournemouth University but he didn't make it. He said he was \\"probably rubbish at the time.‚Äù In 2005, Cardle joined alternative rock/pop band Darwyn and the band recorded an 11-track album, When You Wake, the band also released a follow-up EP, Little Sunlight in 2006. The band described themselves as an acoustic rock band. The band's first album contained tracks \\"Violet\\" and title track \\"When You Wake\\". They were awarded an Arts Council England grant which they used to record the EP Little Sunlight. The band played at many festivals including Stortford Music Festival and Brownstock Festival and regularly played at the venue and recording studio Highbarn in Essex. Cardle and Darwyn band member Ali McMillan also played as a two-piece under the name Darwyn, playing acoustic cover versions of popular songs in venues in and around the Suffolk area and videos of them playing together have gained many views on YouTube. In 2009, Cardle became the lead singer and guitarist of rock band called Seven Summers. The band performed live on Sue Marchant's BBC radio program, in December 2009. They released their self- titled album in January 2010. The album featured alternative rock, pop, urban and folk influences. The album included the songs \\"Youngblood\\", \\"Way to Be\\" and \\"Dirt\\" and the follow-up single \\"Picture of You\\". Although the band did not have a recording contract and they distributed their music independently, they reached No.30 on the Official UK Album Downloads Chart and No.11 on the Official UK Independent Album Charts for week ending 25 December 2010, and No.1 on the Official UK Independent Album Breakers Charts for week ending 25 December 2010. Following Cardle's success on The X Factor, the band saw an upsurge in popularity, with their music videos gaining large numbers of views on YouTube. =2010: The X Factor era= Cardle performing on the X Factor tour. In 2010, Cardle auditioned for the seventh series of The X Factor in front of Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole and Louis Walsh, singing Amy Winehouse's \\"You Know I'm No Good\\". At the Bootcamp stage of the show he sang \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", a performance which prompted Simon Cowell to say \\"Why haven't we noticed him before?\\" and Louis Walsh to say \\"He's the biggest surprise of today for me!\\" He was moved to the boys category when the age limit was raised to 28, making Dannii Minogue his mentor. Cardle was favourite to win from before the live shows until the end of the series, with some of the shortest odds the show had ever seen. On the first live show he sang \\"When Love Takes Over\\" which received high praise from all four judges. In week 5 he performed \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" again, which earned him the first standing ovation from all four judges of the series. It remains his most viewed performance on YouTube with over 29 million views to date. In the semi- final he had to withdraw from a secret X Factor gig in London due to throat problems which saw him almost have to miss the show that weekend. In the final he performed a duet with Rihanna. Cardle was announced the winner on 12 December 2010, after receiving 44.61% of the vote. He received the most votes every week from week 2, being beaten only by Mary Byrne in week 1. The week after the series final, Cardle's cover version of \\"Many of Horror\\" originally recorded by Scottish rock trio Biffy Clyro and retitled as \\"When We Collide\\", topped the UK Singles Chart to become the 2010 Christmas number 1 and remained there for three consecutive weeks. The song was nominated in the Best British Single category at the 2011 BRIT Awards. In June 2012 the song reached the one million sale mark, making it the 123rd single to sell a million copies in the UK and the fourth by an X Factor contestant. In Ireland it is the fourth best selling single of all time, and the best selling single of the century so far, as of 31 December 2015. Cardle remains good friends with fellow contestant Aiden Grimshaw and mentor Dannii Minogue. On 15 March 2011, it was reported that Cardle signed a record deal with Syco Music in a joint venture with Columbia Records, becoming the first The X Factor winner not to be exclusively signed to Simon Cowell's label. Beyond singing on The X Factor, Cardle says he tries to watch the show in his spare time. {class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;\\" |- ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"background:#BFBFBF;\\"The X Factor performances and results |- ! style=\\"text-align:centre;\\"Show ! style=\\"text-align:centre;\\"Song choice ! style=\\"text-align:centre;\\"Theme ! style=\\"text-align:centre;\\"Result |- !

On 18 August 2011, Cardle revealed that his debut album, Letters, would be released in the UK on 17 October 2011. Cardle said he was nervous about releasing his album as previous male X Factor winners have not been very successful, and female winners Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke enjoyed massive success. Whilst working on the album Cardle collaborated with various writers including Eg White and James Walsh. The album's first single, \\"Run for Your Life,\\" written by Gary Barlow, was premiered on The Chris Moyles Show on 5 September 2011. Cardle appeared on the BBC Breakfast show on 1 September to give a preview of the video. The video was then premiered in full on 5 September on his YouTube channel. The single was released on 9 October 2011, Cardle performed the song on The X Factor on the same day. He also performed another track from the album, \\"All For Nothing\\", on ITV2 show The Xtra Factor. \\"Run for Your Life\\" peaked at number 6 on the UK Top 40 Chart. Prior to the album release Cardle went on a five date tour ending on 3 October at Koko in London. Letters was released on 17 October and debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums chart and spent 16 consecutive weeks in the top 40. A second single, \\"Starlight\\", was released on 4 December 2011. It had been originally intended as the first single before \\"Run for Your Life\\" was sent to him and was generally better received by fans and journalists. Despite this, it only charted at number 185 but sparked a boost in album sales which saw \\"Letters\\" return to the top 25 on the album charts shortly after \\"Starlight\\"s release. The third and final single to be released from \\"Letters\\" was Amazing which was released as an EP, containing a new track called \\"All Is Said\\", which Cardle wrote with James Walsh, a new recording of \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" and a live version of the album track \\"Slowly\\" recorded at the album launch. In February 2012 he embarked on a sell out tour, the Letters Tour. The tour ended on 29 March 2012 at Hammersmith Apollo. In September 2012 he said this was his favourite gig so far in his career. =2012‚Äì13: New record label and The Fire= On 20 May 2012, Cardle announced on Twitter that he had parted ways with Columbia Records. In October 2012, Cardle explained he left Sony through his own choice because he wasn't a priority. \\"I would just have been left to get on with it while One Direction ruled the planet. Which is brilliant for them - I'm so proud of them - but I needed to be a bit selfish. I asked Sony to let me go and they said okay.\\" Later, in October 2013 he stated another reason for leaving was because of the lack of control he had with decisions such as \\"Run for Your Life\\" being released as his first single instead of \\"Starlight\\" which he'd written and preferred. On 9 September 2012, So What Recordings, part of the Silva Screen Music Group, announced that Cardle's second album, The Fire would be released on 29 October 2012 on their label. On 11 September 2012, the lead single, \\"It's Only Love\\" was released online on Cardle's YouTube channel as an audio only video. The video for the song was premiered on 3 October. Even though the song was promoted as being the lead single, it was not released as a standalone product and was only made available to buy at the same time as the album, and therefore it did not enter the singles chart. The Fire debuted at number 8 in the UK album chart, giving Cardle his second top 10 album. He said the album is more like what he did before The X Factor than Letters, and feels more honest. \\"I‚Äôm getting closer to myself, and getting back to what I do and what I‚Äôve always done.\\" A second single, \\"Anyone Else\\" was released on 31 December 2012. On 10 December 2012 an Unplugged Tour was announced on Cardle's website. Tickets went on general sale on 12 December with some dates selling out on the first day. The tour ran through April and May 2013 over the UK and Ireland. =2013‚Äì14: Porcelain= On 16 April 2013 Cardle confirmed he was in the process of making his third album in a video message to his fans on Facebook. In July 2013, Music Week announced he has teamed up with Absolute Marketing for the album, which is an independent release, having moved on from So What Recordings. The title, Porcelain, was revealed on 19 August 2013, with 28 October 2013 as the release date. It is described as incorporating \\"everything from Rock, Funk, Soul, Gospel, Pop and Blues to create his most musically diverse piece of work yet.\\" The first single, a duet with Melanie C called \\"Loving You\\", premiered on The Ken Bruce Show on BBC Radio 2 on 2 July. It was released 18 August 2013 and had a positive response on the charts in UK. It reached number 14 on the single chart, number 2 on the Independent charts, number 11 in the Scottish charts and top 50 in the Irish charts. The second single, \\"When You Were My Girl\\", was released on 13 October 2013. On 8 October 2013 Cardle announced he has signed a worldwide publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis. Porcelain reached number 11 on the UK Albums chart. On 25 February 2014, he announced the next single from the album would be \\"Hit My Heart\\". On 28 September, Cardle performed a cover of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" at the Miss World 2013 in Bali, Indonesia. The Porcelain Tour in support of the album was announced on 30 October 2013, beginning in April 2014. On 20 June 2014, Cardle performed a free gig at the Portadown's Got Talent awards, hosted in the People's Park of Portadown, Northern Ireland. The event is part of the Peace Process in Northern Ireland and is supported and backed by the EU. =2015‚Äìpresent: Musical theatre and Time to Be Alive= On 11 May 2015, it was announced Cardle would take over the lead role of Huey Calhoun in a production of Memphis from 6 July 2015 until the end of its run in October. It was his first acting role. In August 2014, Cardle confirmed he was working on his fourth album. In 2016, he embarked on a summer tour, entitled the Intimate and Live Tour, to promote the new material and to test it live before recording. A limited edition live album recorded from the tour was released shortly after. Cardle explained the longer than usual gap in between albums was because he was \\"running on empty\\" around the release of his last album and that he needed to recharge. \\"What has been brilliant for me this time around is the more relaxed nature of the writing and recording process. I've had gaps where I've been able to live, recharge and become inspired again.\\" He describes it as a lot more electronic than his previous albums. His fourth album, Time to Be Alive, was released through Sony on 27 April 2018. The lead single \\"Desire\\" was premiered on BBC Radio 2 on 13 March 2018. Cardle returned to the West End on 31 July 2018, playing the role of Wally Strand in Strictly Ballroom until it closes on 27 October 2018. Cardle played the role of Pilate in Jesus Christ Superstar at the Barbican from 4 July until 24 August 2019. Later in the year he reuinted with his former band Seven Summers for a gig in Chelmsford, and they have begun to work to new music together. Artistry Cardle performing in Belfast, 2012. =Music and voice= Cardle is a tenor with a vocal range of around B2-F5. Being a fan of heavy metal music from a young age, he had tried to emulate the singing style of his rock heroes such as Kurt Cobain, but found it was damaging his vocal cords. After taking advice from the owners of Highbarn, a venue in Essex he'd often played at in the past, he had vocal coaching, which helped increase his range and soften his sound. He is known for his falsetto and being able to reach notes typically unusual for a male singer. Upon Cardle winning The X Factor he has been involved in what type of music he would like to record, which led to the release of his debut album Letters. Cardle co-wrote eleven of the tracks which appeared on the album and a reviewer noted Cardle's \\"impressive falsetto\\". =Influences= Cardle says he is influenced by everything he has ever listened to, being a fan of a range of music \\"I love Dave Matthews and Rage Against the Machine are one of my favourite bands, but then again I also love Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, so kind of all sorts really. It's a pretty weird mix.\\" He cites \\"Thank U\\" by Alanis Morissette as the first song he was really inspired by and is a big fan of hers, he has covered this song on tour as well as another of her songs, \\"Uninvited\\". Other artists Cardle has cited as favourites when he began singing include Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, Pearl Jam and Peter Gabriel. While recording his debut album, Letters, Cardle took many different artists as an influence; reviews compared tracks to those by artists such as Snow Patrol, Coldplay as well as Chris Martin.

The sixteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm, and third hurricane of the season, Josephine developed from an area of disturbed weather near the Bahamas on October 7, forming with subtropical characteristics. It quickly organized, and gained tropical characteristics as it strengthened into a tropical storm on October 8\\\\. Gradual intensification occurred thereafter, reaching hurricane status on October 10\\\\. The storm headed northward, remaining well offshore of the eastern United States. Josephine strengthened further and peaked as a moderately strong Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on October 12\\\\. On the following day, Josephine weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane before becoming nearly stationary. It later headed northeastward and paralleled the coast well offshore of Nova Scotia. By October 17, Josephine weakened back to a tropical storm, shortly before beginning to execute a cyclonic loop to the south of Newfoundland. While executing the cyclonic loop, Josephine became extratropical on October 18\\\\. Although Josephine remained well offshore of the eastern United States, the effects from the storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast. In North Carolina, high tides caused severe beach erosion and minor damage to ocean-front houses. Minor coastal flooding occurred in New York and New Jersey. In addition, one fatality occurred when a man drowned after falling off his boat while sailing a river in Massachusetts. Meteorological history A frontal trough moved eastward off the southeastern United States on September 30, becoming stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed an area of disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting in the development of a subtropical depression on October 7\\\\. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad subtropical low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October 8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine. Further intensification was slow, as Josephine was very large and existed in a relatively cool environment. Shortly thereafter, Josephine curved northward to the northeast of the Bahamas. By October 10, Josephine had strengthened into a hurricane. Josephine continued north-northeastward, and became a Category 2 hurricane on October 11\\\\. Winds increased slightly, and Josephine reached its maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on October 12. Josephine weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane on October 13\\\\. That day, an area of high pressure moved off the northeastern United States, which caused Josephine to decelerate and abruptly curve northeastward, and eventually southeastward. By October 15, Josephine began to accelerate east-northeastward. Later that day, Josephine reached its minimum barometric pressure of . As Josephine continued east-northeastward, it had weakened back into a tropical storm. Under the influence of an area of high pressure to the north and a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 18\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October 19\\\\. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved in that direction until it became unidentifiable on October 21. Preparations and impact Shortly after the system was declared a tropical storm, gale warnings were issued for the central Bahamas starting on October 8\\\\. Slightly more than 24 hours later, a hurricane watch was issued on Eleuthera and the Abaco Islands. By early on October 11, both of the alerts were discontinued. Later that day, gale warnings were issued from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Virginia Beach, Virginia. The warning area was extended to as far north as Nantucket, Massachusetts on October 13\\\\. The warning for the area from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Virginia Beach, Virginia was discontinued late on October 14\\\\. Simultaneously, gale warnings were issued from Nantucket to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In addition, another gale warning was also issued from Cape Cod to Boston, Massachusetts. By October 15, all gale warnings were discontinued. Early in the hurricane's duration, NASA developed a contingency plan for delaying a landing of the space shuttle Challenger by a day in the event Josephine passed near Kennedy Space Center. The shuttle crew filmed the hurricane from orbit using an IMAX camera. This footage of the storm was featured in the 1985 IMAX documentary The Dream is Alive. Although Josephine remained well offshore of the eastern United States, the storm produced strong winds and high seas in combination with an area of high pressure. On the Outer Banks of North Carolina, strong winds were reported from October 11 to October 14\\\\. At Diamond Shoals, sustained winds were at 58 mph (93 km/h), with gusts as high as 75 mph (120 km/h). However, most of the damage caused by Josephine was due to high tides along the East Coast of the United States. On Hatteras Island, tides were above the mean sea level. In addition, wave heights of were reported on the island. Due to the tides, over-wash occurred on highways along the Outer Banks, which in turn caused those roads to close. Coastal erosion was also occurred in that area; most notably, the tides washed away nearly all protective sand dunes built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression, especially in the Rodanthe area. In the absence of protective sand dunes, the Outer Banks became vulnerable to future storms that would also produce high tides. Minor damage to houses were reported due to high tides near Nags Head and Kill Devil Hills; damage was mostly from the detachment of steps and porches. Effects were somewhat lighter in Virginia. Gale force winds were also observed in the state, with winds of 46-52 mph (74-84 km/h) being reporting at Cape Henry and Chesapeake Light, respectively. High tides also occurred in Virginia, with waves of reported at Chesapeake Light. Tidal flooding was reported in Delaware. In response to the hurricane, the United States Coast Guard activated extra workers in the event of any storm emergencies. High winds in Sea Bright, New Jersey washed an abandoned cabin cruiser into the jetty along the coast. In the same town, officials closed a portion of New Jersey Route 36. Helicopters evacuated three coast guardsmen from Ambrose Light in New York Harbor and two guardsmen from West Bank Light. Tides between above normal resulted in minor coastal flooding on Long Island, New York and in parts of New Jersey. Officials closed of a road in Southampton due to deep flooding. In Massachusetts, a man fell off his boat and drowned while sailing the North River amidst large swells produced by Josephine. The outer fringes of the storm produced wind and rainfall in Cape Cod. In Newfoundland, Josephine dropped light rainfall, peaking at slightly less than . Josephine also caused major effects to marine interests. High waves, estimated to have exceeded 15 ft (4.6 m), disabled a sailboat with a crew of six on it. They were quickly rescued after issuing a distress signal to a nearby tanker vessel. The storm caused the loss of 1,799 bags of sorghum from water damage when a freighter encountered Josephine en route to Baltimore, Maryland. The major shipping lanes of North America were severely impacted, with more than 25 ships reporting winds of at least 58 mph (93 km/h) over a period of nine days. Furthermore, at least five of those ships reported hurricane force winds during a period of six days. The highest wind speed reported from a ship was 92 mph (148 km/h), which was observed on October 16.

Degas (2 October 1935 - 3 April 2020) was an English film and television writer and producer, merchandiser, and creative packager of ancillary rights. Early career Degas was born to English parents in Argentina. As a youth, he worked as a writer and director in amateur productions. At the age of 21, he took a job in the United States at the CBS network as a production trainee in public affairs programming. He later worked with Charles Collingwood on the documentaries Adventure and Odyssey. In 1957, John Houseman invited Degas to work on his TV anthology series The Seven Lively Arts for CBS. During this period, Degas also worked with Reginald Rose, Sidney Lumet and George Roy Hill. At the age of 27, Degas was appointed Executive Producer of Light Entertainment and a member of the programming board for a new CBS affiliate. After a meeting with Roger Moore, Degas received the opportunity to write several episodes of the TV series The Saint. He also wrote episodes of The Baron and Strange Report for ITC Entertainment, Shirley's World for the American Broadcasting Company, and The Informer and The Mask of Janus for the BBC. In 1963, Degas started creating and developing his own TV series with BBC Television. He created and wrote three episodes for the series Vendetta. Degas also authored three paperbacks as spinoffs from the series and commissioned the series music from composer John Barry. A fluent Italian speaker, Degas also started collaborating with Dino de Laurentiis on design, script consulting and editing for the films Barbarella (film), Danger Diabolik, Better a Widow and Summertime Killer. In 1975, after finishing these projects, Degas served as producer of The Venturers, a drama series for BBC TV concerning the world of high finance.  Colditz  Degas produced the television series Colditz, a BBC TV/MCA Universal co-production in 1972. It was a Second World War drama series based on the film The Colditz Story and the book The Latter Days by Major Patrick Robert Reid. During its run, Colditz was named Best BBC TV Series, Best British TV Series, Best Design, and Best Music. It had a record viewing audience of 18 million in the United Kingdom each week and was screened in 47 countries. Using the intellectual property of Colditz, Degas pioneered the exploitation of television and film ancillary rights. He conceived, developed and licensed the following merchandising projects *The Spirit of Colditz, a model of the Colditz glider for Airfix *Colditz Breakpoint, a dramatic journey into the sounds of pursuit, capture and escape from Colditz released on an LP by EMI *The Colditz Escape Kit, a DIY model of Colditz Castle *an Action Man model *endorsements for a Mars bar promotion that culminated in the board-game Escape from Colditz Degas conceived and developed Escape from Colditz jointly with Major P. R. Reid. The game sold over half a million copies, including a Spanish version.  Freelance career  Degas returned to the US and to TV programming in New York and Hollywood for a brief period, which included being Head of Development for Brut Productions and for Danny Thomas Enterprises. With high hopes, he turned to the world of theatre and co-produced Chapter 17 by Simon Gray, which was a dismal failure at the box office. A close friendship with the legendary Gloria Swanson led to their collaboration on the writing of her long-awaited biography. Accordingly, in 1979 Degas set up Gloria's Way Inc and personally closed a publishing contract with Random House. The 520-page volume sold over 148,000 in hard cover and close to 300,000 in paperback, and was critically acclaimed in all three language editions. His distinctive marketing plan for the book and his promotional tour with Gloria refined his marketing skills in all aspects of the media. Returning to the UK, he joined Polymuse Inc., an international film investment company, as Executive Vice-President in charge of Creative Affairs and Marketing emphasising that ‚Äúin an advertising led system in a new billion dollar market in Europe it was time to develop a competitive strategy and target specific audiences on a cost effective bases ‚Äì and that it was a fallacy to think that inexpensive programmes meant inferior TV.‚Äù In 1990, together with Harry Robertson he brought his innovative skills back to the BBC as creator, writer and producer of Specials, a TV drama series, including three paperback editions published by Fontana, about part- time policemen ‚Äì ordinary people whose commitment made them extraordinary. This was followed by Virtual Murder, an off-beat psychological 'whodunit' drama series about two jet-set investigative psychologists involved in bizarre crimes. The series' guest stars included Richard Todd, Dora Bryan and Jon Pertwee. A later project was Confidentially Speaking, created in association with British Telecom, and written as an \\"eavesdropping drama\\" down a crossed telephone line. Degas later took an extended sabbatical, and travelled the globe. He became a committed Sinophile and turned to publishing and ancillary rights sales.

Many employers are reluctant to hire a person they know has epilepsy, even if the seizures are controlled by medication. If the employee suffers a seizure while at work, they could harm themselves (but rarely others, contrary to popular belief) depending on the nature of the work. Employers are often unwilling to bear any financial costs that may come from employing a person with epilepsy, i.e. insurance costs, paid sick leave etc. Many people whose seizures are successfully controlled by a medication suffer from a variety of side effects, most notably drowsiness, which may affect job performance. Many laws prohibit or restrict people with epilepsy from performing certain duties, most notably driving or operating dangerous machinery, thereby lowering the pool of jobs available to people with epilepsy. Epilepsy sufferers are also prohibited from joining the armed forces, though they may work in certain civilian military positions. Employment issues are responsible for 85% of the cost of epilepsy on society.Epilepsy A to Z: A Concise Encyclopedia By William O. Tatum, Peter W. Kaplan, Pierre Jallon: page 112 In the United States, the median income for persons with epilepsy is 93% that of all persons. The unemployment rate for persons with epilepsy has been reported to be between 25% and 69%. The high school graduation rate has been reported at 64%, compared with an overall national average of 82%.The treatment of epilepsy: principles & practice By Elaine Wyllie, Ajay Gupta, Deepak K. Lachhwani: page 1203 Issues The following issues exist for people with epilepsy in their quest for and performance of employment: =Barring from employment= People with epilepsy may be barred from various types of employment, either by law, by company regulations, or by common sense, thereby lowering the pool of jobs available to the job seeker.Managing Epilepsy: A Clinical Handbook By Malcolm P. Taylor: page 114-15 Those barred from driving by the laws of the land in which they reside cannot perform any jobs that involve operating a motor vehicle. Even if the patients are permitted by law to drive their own vehicle, they may be barred by local and national laws from driving a vehicle for the purpose of certain types of employment, such as getting a Commercial Driver's License or driving a school bus or being the engineer of a train (even if a person who has not had a seizure in a certain time period is not permanently banned, they may still have to be able to stay seizure-free for a year or more even without medication).Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 174 Most countries bar those who have ever had a seizure from flying an aircraft, except perhaps for a private craft, especially if the aircraft in question is a commercial or military aircraft or is any type of jet, making a career in aviation or in space extremely unlikely (again, some people who have been seizure-free without medication for a considerable time period, usually at least a year, are allowed to fly- even jets- in some cases, if they can remain seizure-free for at least a year without using anticonvulsant drugs). Jobs involving the operation of dangerous machinery may pose a problem to people with epilepsy, including construction and industrial work. Many places have laws barring those with epilepsy whose seizures are not entirely controlled from working in positions that involve a high degree of responsibility to the well-being of others. This includes police officers, teachers, and health care workers. =Occupational hazards= There are many hazards that people with epilepsy, including those whose seizures are fully controlled by medication, face in the workplace. Those with active seizures face the obvious risk of loss of consciousness or muscle control, and those with side effects face diminished concentration or physical strength. Some of the hazards include:Epilepsy A to Z: A Concise Encyclopedia By William O. Tatum, Peter W. Kaplan, Pierre Jallon: page 113 *Working near a body of water, a high-voltage power line, or at extreme heights *Working with machines, equipment, or hazardous chemicals or materials that require care in their usage *The supervision of other persons, where any lapse in such supervision may be hazardous =Transportation= Even if a person with epilepsy is able to safely perform job duties him/herself, many are limited where they can work if they cannot provide their own transportation to the job site. Since some cannot drive themselves to work, they cannot travel to a place of employment.Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 183Women with epilepsy: a handbook of health and treatment issues By Martha J. Morrell, Kerry L. Flynn: page 282 Some people with epilepsy who cannot drive may also be unable to safely walk, use public transportation, or otherwise independently travel safely due to their seizure risk, further preventing them from reaching a place of employment. Such persons may be at risk for suffering seizures while on or waiting for a public transport vehicle or while crossing the street. =Stigma= Stigma alone can make it more difficult for people with epilepsy to find jobs. Even if one's seizures are fully controlled by medication, or if the condition has been completely cured by surgery, many employers are reluctant to hire a person with epilepsy.Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 45 United States law does not require an applicant for a job to disclose one's condition to the employer. If an applicant voluntarily reveals one's condition, the employer is only allowed to ask whether the employee requires any special accommodations, and if so, what types. If an employer learns of an epileptic condition after making a decision to hire an employee, the employer is not legally permitted to withdraw the decision to hire as a result of this information unless the employee's duties will pose a risk to public safety. If this is the case, the employer is permitted to require the employee to obtain information from a physician regarding this. Federal law in the United States requires that federal government agencies and employers receiving federal funding cannot discriminate in hiring against a prospective employee with epilepsy unless the duties one would be performing can be unsafe with a seizure disorder.Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 218 =Special accommodations= Employees who have epilepsy may require special accommodations from their employers. Although against the law, some employers may feel reluctant to provide these accommodations. Some special needs include:Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 287 Safety *Safety shields around pieces of equipment (which should be considered standard for all workers) *Carpeting on concrete or other hard floors Hours *Extra breaks for one who is often drowsy or fatigued as a result of one's condition *Extended breaks following a seizure, should one occur *Days off from work in the event a longer recovery is needed Seizures while on duty According to the law of the United States, an employer is permitted to inquire into an employee's epileptic condition if the employee suffers one or more seizures while on duty only if they affect safety or job performance. The employer is permitted to require the employee to take a leave of absence or reassign the employee until the issues are resolved if the seizures pose a threat to the safety of others. Epilepsy as a disability Depending on the severity, epilepsy can be considered a disability which makes employment very difficult or even impossible for many sufferers for a variety of reasons. Those with seizures that cannot be controlled may find themselves unable to perform job duties of any type because their consciousness is constantly interrupted by the seizures. The aftermath of an often unpredictable seizure may leave a patient too fatigued to work for a period of time, or may temporarily impair the patient's memory. Seizures may pose a hazard to the employee or others in the event the employee loses consciousness while performing certain duties. Even if the seizures are completely controlled by a medication, side effects, such as drowsiness or fatigue, may make the performance of duties impossible or more difficult. In the United States, while the Americans with Disabilities Act does not fully protect persons with epilepsy from discrimination in hiring practices, the Social Security Administration only considers people with epilepsy \\"disabled\\" and thereby eligible to receive benefits if the condition severely limits one or more major life activities.Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: pge 283 Employment may be hard to find or perform for many people with epilepsy, but not all are eligible for government-sponsored disability payments. To qualify, documentation to the Social Security Administration of an EEG detailing a typical seizure is required, though a normal diagnosis does not rule out benefits. A seizure diary, including times and dates of seizures, and the effects the seizures have had is required. A person may qualify either if the seizures themselves have debilitating effects, or if the drugs used to treat the disorder have side effects that make employment impossible or difficult.Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 308 Armed forces Many countries restrict people with epilepsy from joining their armed forces. In the United States, in order to enroll in military service in a combat role, one must be seizure-free since age 5 and off all medications.Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: pages 173-74 In the United Kingdom people with epilepsy are automatically barred for life from joining the military.

The theater enjoyed exceptional years in the mid-1870s due to good economic times following the discovery of the discrete big bonanza ore chamber on the Comstock Lode. Coupled with recession on the East Coast, many recognized actors and actresses trekked west to play the California. The cavalcade of stars included Dion Boucicault in his own creations, Lotta Crabtree, William J.

In spite of the theatre's success, the Bank of California, which owned the theatre, failed in 1875, as the National Panic of 1873 challenged the financial picture after the short-lived silver boom. Soon thereafter, Ralston went swimming and drowned, leading to speculation that he might have committed suicide.This is somewhat belied by the evidence that he was seen thrashing about in the water at the time of his drowning. Although the theatre then went into a decline, it had broken manager Thomas Maguire's hegemony in the western theater world.

It was revised prior to publication in 1839, when it was dedicated to Franz Liszt. It is generally described as one of Schumann's greatest works for solo piano, and is one of the central works of the early Romantic period. It is often called by the Italian version, Fantasia; the word \\"Fantasie\\" is the German spelling. Structure Beethoven Monument The Fantasie is in loose sonata form. Its three movements are headed: * Durchaus fantastisch und leidenschaftlich vorzutragen; Im Legenden-Ton - Quite fantastic and passionate to deliver; In the legend tone. * M√§√üig. Durchaus energisch - Moderate. Quite energetic. (in E‚ô≠ major) * Langsam getragen. Durchweg leise zu halten. - Worn slowly. To keep quiet throughout. The first movement is rhapsodic and passionate; the middle movement is a grandiose rondo based on a majestic march, with episodes that recall the emotion of the first movement; and the finale is slow and meditative.  Genesis  The piece has its origin in early 1836, when Schumann composed a piece entitled Ruines expressing his distress at being parted from his beloved Clara Wieck (later to become his wife). This later became the first movement of the Fantasy. Later that year, he wrote two more movements to create a work intended as a contribution to the appeal for funds to erect a monument to Beethoven in his birthplace, Bonn. Schumann offered the work to the publisher Kirstner, suggesting that 100 presentation copies could be sold to raise money for the monument. Other contributions to the Beethoven monument fund included Mendelssohn's Variations s√©rieuses.New York Philharmonic The original title of Schumann's work was \\"Obolen auf Beethovens Monument: Ruinen, Trophaen, Palmen, Grosse Sonate f.d. Piano f. F√ºr Beethovens Denkmal\\". Kirstner refused, and Schumann tried offering the piece to Haslinger in January 1837. When Haslinger also refused, he offered it to Breitkopf & H√§rtel in May 1837. The movements' subtitles (Ruins, Trophies, Palms) became Ruins, Triumphal Arch, and Constellation, and were then removed altogether before Breitkopf & H√§rtel eventually issued the Fantasie in May 1839.For discussion of the work's titles during its development, see Marston (1992) p. 23 It was printed with a dedication to Franz Liszt. The Beethoven monument was eventually completed, due mainly to the efforts of Liszt, who paid 2,666 thaler,Marston (1992), p. 2 the largest single contribution. It was unveiled in grand style in 1845, the attendees including Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and many other dignitaries and composers, but not Schumann, who was ill.  Allusion and quotation  Schumann prefaced the work with a quote from Friedrich Schlegel: : Durch alle T√∂ne t√∂net : Im bunten Erdentraum : Ein leiser Ton gezogen : F√ºr den, der heimlich lauschet. (\\"Resounding through all the notes In the earth's colorful dream There sounds a faint long-drawn note For the one who listens in secret.\\") The musical quotation of a phrase from Beethoven's song cycle An die ferne Geliebte in the coda of the first movement was not acknowledged by Schumann, and apparently was not spotted until 1910.Marston (1992) p. 36 The text of the passage quoted is: Accept then these songs [beloved, which I sang for you alone]. Both the Schlegel stanza and the Beethoven quotation are appropriate to Schumann's current situation of separation from Clara Wieck. Schumann wrote to Clara: The first movement may well be the most passionate I have ever composed ‚Äì a deep lament for you. They still had many tribulations to suffer before they finally married four years later.  Reception and performance  Liszt was one of the few pianists capable of meeting the then-unparalleled demands of the Fantasie, particularly the second movement coda's rapid skips in opposite directions simultaneously. He had played the piece to Schumann privately, and later incorporated it into his teaching repertory, but he considered it unsuitable for public performance and never played it in public.Signum Classics However, Liszt returned the honour by dedicating his own Sonata in B minor to Schumann in 1853. Clara Schumann did not start to perform the Fantasie in her concerts until 1866, ten years after the composer died. The Fantasie has been recorded many times, including versions by G√©za Anda, Martha Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Annie Fischer, Nelson Freire, Vladimir Horowitz, Wilhelm Kempff, Alicia de Larrocha, Murray Perahia, Maurizio Pollini, Sviatoslav Richter, Mitsuko Uchida and Mikhail Voskresensky.

Background Vaux was the third daughter of William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden (1535‚Äì1595) and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Beaumont of Grace Dieu, Leicester. She and her sister Eleanor Brooksby supported Catholic priests by renting houses where priests could convene safely. Among these houses was White Webbs in Enfield Chase, which was visited by several of the Gunpowder Plotters. Vaux was particularly devoted to Father Henry Garnet, a Jesuit priest who was later executed for his role in the Gunpowder Plot. She was related to Francis Tresham, one of the plotters. Both Vaux and Tresham have been suspected of being the author of an anonymous letter to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to avoid Parliament on 5 November 1605, the day that the Gunpowder Plotters intended to blow it up. This letter, which Monteagle gave to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, was instrumental in foiling the plot. The identity of the letter's author has never been conclusively determined. The theory that it was written by Vaux is based largely on \\"perceived similarities\\" between her handwriting and that used in the letter. Vaux suspected the existence of the Gunpowder Plot, but she played no direct role in it. She was arrested shortly after the plot was discovered but was released on a bond put up by Lewis Pickering. After her release, she tried unsuccessfully to hide Garnet at the home of Thomas Abington at Hindlip, Worcestershire. He was discovered and arrested on 25 January; Vaux travelled to London, where Garnet was incarcerated in the Tower of London. She attempted to communicate with him through concealed messages on letters given to Garnet's gaoler. The messages were written in orange juice; historian Anstruther argues that their illegibility indicates that Vaux was near-sighted and unaccustomed to writing. The messages were forwarded to Salisbury, and Vaux was arrested in March 1606. Under interrogation, she proclaimed herself innocent of treason but admitted to receiving conspirators at her houses; she was released in August. Vaux moved to her sister Eleanor's family estate in Leicestershire, where she was convicted of recusancy in 1625, and after her sister's death moved to Stanley Grange, Derbyshire. She founded a school for boys from Catholic noble families, which the Protestant authorities tried to shut down in 1635. She died in 1637 or later. In popular culture Anne Vaux was played by Helen Longworth in The Gunpowder Plot on BBC Radio 3, Carolyn Pickles in the BBC Radio 4 mini-series Gunpowder Women and by Liv Tyler in the BBC One series Gunpowder.

He died for a heartbreak on 10/01/2020  Early life  The earliest document of Fredi Marcarini's interest in photography is a Super 8 home movie showing him at the age of 4 years old, pretending to shoot pictures with a non-existent camera and using his father's tripod. Later, when he was six, his father bought him a medium format camera with 6x6 film and early negatives from this period still exist, dating back to 1965, showing an early interest in landscape photography and portraits of his younger sister. Marcarini began developing his own film and was printing from his own negatives by the age of 15. His education was accompanied by a succession of jobs including petrol station attendant, bartender, builder and waiter but also worked in a photo studio shooting still life, and later, whilst attending military service, as a crime scene photographer in the police force.  Influences  Marcarini's greatest influences as a photographer were the works of Arthur Tress and Les Krims.  Career  Marcarini taught himself photography through experimentation, and gradually started to put his work together into a portfolio, initially selling images to magazines and advertising agencies and eventually gaining commissions. After a decade spent as a food photographer in the 80s, he switched to portraiture, a field in which he found his real passion and developed his style. In the early 2000 he also started to take on work as a reportage photographer, producing several bodies of work from his travels in Africa, South America, Arctic and the Caribbean Islands.

They were one of the longest unsolved challenges in high-level mountaineering, but have now been successfully climbed. The rocks are located at around 7,800, 8,100 and 8,200 metres above sea level (height of base of pinnacle) and are therefore already in the death zone, in which people cannot usually recover, even at rest. The normal routes on Everest avoid this area; the normal northern route leaves it to the left. During the various attempts to conquer the pinnacles and open a new route along the entire northeast ridge, there were frequently serious problems and fatalities. In 1982 Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker died in the first serious attempt to climb in groups at grade 5 within the death zone. In 1992 a joint Japanese-Kazakh expedition crossed the Pinnacles but were unable to continue to the summit. They found a body beyond the second pinnacle at approximately 8,200m on the Rongbuk side of the ridge. Photographs taken by Vladimir Suviga and sent to Chris Bonington confirmed that the body was that of Peter Boardman. Joe Tasker's body has never been found. In 1988, Russell Brice and Harry Taylor successfully climbed the Three Pinnacles, but they were so exhausted after climbing the third pinnacle that they abandoned their original plan to continue along the normal route to the summit. Instead, they crossed the normal route along the north ridge and descended to the North Col. Not until 1995 did a team from a Japanese university, supported by a group of about 35 Sherpa porters, climb the entire northeast ridge route, including the Three Pinnacles in both directions. In order to facilitate the expedition, the Sherpas had covered virtually the entire route with fixed ropes. Only after the ropes were in place did a group of Japanese go to the top. Even today this part of the vast mountain is almost always avoided, too great are its difficulties that range from the Pinnacles themselves to the weather, the extreme cold, the winds and the altitude as well as the arduous terrain. Almost all the mountaineering challenges on Mount Everest have now been overcome, but there remain two routes with extraordinary difficulties: a direttissima climb up the avalanche-prone East Face ‚Äì the only yet unclimbed direct route on Everest, and ascent of the north pillar on the East Face over the (according to George Mallory) so-called \\"Fantasy Ridge\\".

Rules was founded in 1798 by Thomas Rule, and describes itself as London's oldest restaurant. History  Rules was opened by Thomas Rule in 1798, primarily as an oyster bar but served, and continues to serve, traditional British cuisine. Rules specialises in game and has its own estate, the Lartington Estate, in Teesdale. The restaurant stayed in the Rule family until World War I, when Charles Rule swapped businesses with Thomas Bell. Bell's daughter subsequently sold the restaurant to the current owner John Mayhew in 1984. Efforts have been made to carefully preserve the original features in the main restaurant and in the cocktail bar. The walls are decorated with a series of sketches, oil paintings and cartoons which have been collected throughout its history. A number of its artworks depict theatrical history. Rules has been frequented by Henry Irving and Laurence Olivier amongst others. The restaurant has featured in novels by Graham Greene, Dick Francis, Dorothy L. Sayers and Evelyn Waugh. John Betjeman complained to the Greater London Council in 1971 when the restaurant was under threat from demolition. The then-head chef of Rules, Rory Kennedy was featured in the cooking series, Iron Chef, where he challenged Iron Chef French, Hiroyuki Sakai. The two would finish in a draw for the theme of European Rabbit. A tiebreaker was then held with the theme of Pigeon, where Sakai prevailed.

An accomplished blues and jazz guitarist and singer in Northern California and the San Francisco Bay Area, popularly known as the Walkin' Blues Man, he hosted a popular cable-access television program, \\"Earl Oliver & Friends: Live from LaVal's\\", later called \\"Live on Location\\", that aired in 16 stations throughout the region from 1992 to 1995. He has also been the lead vocalist for several California-based bands, most recently, the Groovinators. From May, 2005 until August, 2013, Oliver was a regular performer on the Skunk Train, a heritage railway which runs daily from Fort Bragg and Willits, California, and at events such as the Palo Alto Art Walk and Project Read for the San Francisco Public Library. In 2001, he was called \\"one of San Francisco's undiscovered treasures\\" by San Francisco Arts Magazine. The nephew of professional wrestler Ray \\"Rip the Crippler\\" Oliver, Oliver is a longtime wrestling columnist and historian. He is perhaps best known in the internet wrestling community as the founder of Solie's Vintage Wrestling, a historical professional wrestling website dedicated to the memory of announcer Gordon Solie, which is the oldest continually active pro wrestling website on the internet. Biography =Early life and career= Earl Oliver was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, but later moved with his family to Southern California. At age 14, Oliver began playing as a professional musician and in 1969 moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he performed at local jazz and rock music night clubs such as The Melting Pot, La Boh√®me, The Vintner, Family Farmacy, and the Seventh Seal Coffee-House by the early-1970s. While studying music, he was given singing lessons from one-time Metropolitan Opera diva Margo Weiss. He also became involved in stage acting within a few years with memorable performances in Bye Bye Birdie, George M! and Don't Drink the Water at the Glendale Center, as well performing as a magician at The Magic Castle. In 1977, he portrayed the \\"evil sorcerer\\" in Aladdin at Pamela and Walter Gilmore's Golden Mall Playhouse. Around this time, he began producing a variety show, The Showcase, which included musicians, singers, comics, clowns, fire eaters, poetry readers and other entertainers. It was very successful on the night club circuit, being regularly featured at the Horn in Santa Monica, and received praise from the LA Weekly in July 1979. =Music and television career= In the 1980s, Oliver returned to the music scene finding limited success with the bands JUMP CITY and The Sphere. He also entered the recording business producing radio advertisements for local camera stores and shoe emporiums, doing voice overs and writing advertising jingles. Also during this time, he began developing the stage persona of \\"a blues shouting, guitar playing\\" singer called the \\"Walkin' Blues Man\\". The character would become a familiar sight at countless parades, music and art festivals, county fairs, farmers markets and other outdoor events throughout the West Coast of the United States and in Canada for the next 20 years. By the end of the decade, Oliver had also developed a unique variety act by incorporating magic into his musical performances, such as draping a scarf over his guitar at the end of his set and making it disappear, which was favorably reviewed by the San Fernando Valley Daily News in October 1989. In 1992, Oliver began producing a monthly cable-access television program, \\"Earl Oliver & Friends: Live from LaVal's\\", later called \\"Live on Location\\", which featured variety acts at La Val's Subterranean basement club. The show became very popular in San Francisco and was eventually broadcast in 16 stations throughout the region until 1995. =Internet writing= Oliver held a number of entertainment and music-related occupations throughout his life including as a disk jockey, carnival barker, broadcast journalist, answering service operator, voice artist, and ring announcer. However, he was primarily employed as a graphic production artist and later, with rise of the internet during the 1990s, as a web designer and corporate trainer. As a young man, he developed an interest in professional wrestling, being the nephew of Rip \\"The Crippler\\" Oliver, and was especially a fan of famed Championship Wrestling from Florida play-by-play announcer Gordon Solie. In 1995, Oliver started a website in his honor, Solie's Vintage Wrestling, dedicated to the history of professional wrestling. It was the first of its kind at the time of its opening and remains the oldest professional wrestling website still active. He was also the editor of the weekly Solie's Wrestling Newsletter from 1996 to 2003. In addition to Solie's Vintage Wrestling, Oliver has also occasionally contributed to WrestlingClassics.com and was later interviewed in The Wrestling Channel Radio Network's first original production Jeremy Hartley's Up Close and Personal. In 1999, he publicly criticized SLAM! Wrestling columnist Eric Benner for a controversial article on the Hart family following the ring death of Owen Hart. He was occasionally in contact with Solie, who later endorsed the website, shortly before his death in 2000 and was quoted by both wrestling websites and the mainstream media upon the publishing of Solie's biography Gordon Solie: Something Left Behind five years later. =Recent years= In 2001, he was called \\"one of San Francisco's undiscovered treasures\\" by San Francisco Arts Magazine. In October 2003 he moved to Fort Bragg, California where Oliver and his wife Lonna settled in a 90-year-old farmhouse. After being laid off from IKON Office Solutions' Print on Demand Division in 2005, Oliver left the corporate world to become a full-time musician and writer. In his familiar \\"Walkin' Blues Man\\" act, he has appeared at such civic events such as the Palo Alto Art Walk and Project Read for the San Francisco Public Library. He has been a regular performer on the Skunk Train, a heritage railway running between Fort Bragg and Willits, California, and was on hand with Greg Schindel, The Trainsinger and The Black Bart Gunfighters to celebrate its 120th anniversary. Oliver also formed a partnership with Mendocino Coast music legend, Butch Kwan, releasing the Skunk Train Blues album, and performed together for over two years appearing at the 2004 and 2006 Caspar World Folk Festival, \\"Art in the Gardens\\" at the North Coast Botanical Gardens, and headlined the 12th annual \\"Local Licks Live\\" concert sponsored by KOZT 95.3 FM. Beginning in 2005, they were regular performers at Fort Bragg's annual \\"World's Largest Salmon BarBQ\\". In recent years, he has revisited several of these events as the lead vocalist for The Groovinators. On May 8, 2010, and again on May 26, 2012, Oliver sang with the Symphony of the Redwoods during their annual POPS Benefit Concerts. At the 2012 concert, Earl was asked to perform with the orchestra for the finale of the show, a \\"Tribute to Old Blues Eyes\\" medley of Frank Sinatra hits. Solie's Vintage Wrestling Oliver launched Solie's Vintage Wrestling, a historical professional wrestling website, in 1995, named in honor of announcer Gordon Solie, and one of the earliest known pro wrestling website on the internet. It had a number of innovative features, most notably, the most extensive collection of wrestling title histories on the internet.

Despite the film's title, Friedrich \\"Barbarossa\\" features only as a supporting character in this film, which is primarily concerned with the struggle of the Lombard League, which struggled to maintain independence from the Holy Roman Empire, led by the legendary Guelph warrior Alberto da Giussano. This film was co-written and directed by Renzo Martinelli. It has been released on DVD in the United States under the title Sword of War, and elsewhere under the title Barbarossa: Siege Lord. Plot \\"Italy. 12th century AD. Northern Italy is ruled over by a German Emperor: Frederick I Hohenstaufen, known as 'Barbarossa'. His dream is to conquer also Central and Southern Italy, thus reviving the ancient empire founded by Charlemagne. But in the North a young man from Milan has formed an army of 900 young men from different cities: the 'Company of Death'. This young man's name is Alberto Giussano. His dream is to defeat the Emperor and to regain freedom for the Northern lands.\\" The Emperor Barbarossa is out hunting when he is attacked by a wild boar, but is saved by a young boy. Rather, he is the boy's Emperor, Frederick Hohenstaufen, better known as Barbarossa. With this the boy introduces himself as Alberto da Giussano, son of Giovanni; the grateful emperor gives Alberto his imperial dagger inscribed with his name. A few years later, in the German city of W√ºrzburg, Barbarossa is going to see Hildegard von Bingen, the great se√´r. He plans to marry for the second time. The se√´r says that the wedding is blessed. Then she says Frederick of Swabia's name will be remembered for centuries, but to beware of the scythe which will bring defeat and water for it will bring his death. At the wedding, Henry, Duke of Saxony, is marrying a young French girl. The story cuts to Milan where Evandro calls over to the now grown Alberto and tells him to get onto his cart because they must reach the river before dawn. They reach the river and start to load their goods onto a boat there. Lodigiani soldiers arrive and say the merchants crossed through their territory in the night and now they must pay their dues. Evandro pulls a knife and slits the throat of the soldier next to him then Alberto and his companions slay the other soldiers but Alberto is in the fighting. His horse brings him back home where two beautiful women, the blonde Tessa and her brunette sister, sister Eleonora. The brunette kisses Alberto's face while he is still unconscious. Two emissaries from Lodi come to Barbarossa to tell him that the city of Milan is trying to dominate them. Lodi has always been loyal to the Emperor and now they ask him for his help. Barbarossa says he doesn't want to use any force right now on Milan. He says he will write a letter to Milan and the two emissaries will take it to them. A German emissary delivers the letter to Milan. He says that he comes in the name of the Emperor. Milan is warned not to attack Lodi on pain of being banished from the Empire. A cleric named Gerado throws the letter on the ground and steps on it. Gerado's colleague, Siniscalco Barozzi is shocked at the behaviour of his friend and he asks the German emissary not to leave. Alberto is also shocked and asks Gerado what is he going to do now. Gerado says he will gather the army and attack Lodi. Alberto has a nightmare and awakens in fright from his deep sleep. His two brothers tell him that Lodi has been defeated. Barbarossa is furious that Milan attacked Lodi, but he really has no desire to fight. He says it's as if Milan were trying to force him into fighting them. But Barbarossa's charismatic and supportive new queen wants him to go to Milan and destroy that city. Barbarossa sets out for Milan. Tessa, Eleanora and father have dinner when Siniscalco Barozzi arrives, asking the father for the hand of his daughter Tessa. Tessa's Father says that Tessa would make a good wife and he will put in a good word for him with her. Eleonora comes to tell Alberto that Siniscalco Barozzi wants to marry Tessa but she says that will never happen. Alberto says that they say she is a witch and jokes that maybe that is how she knows Tessa's future. Eleanora is hurt and angry by the accusation so to pacify her, Alberto he shows her the large knife given to him by Barbarossa himself. Eleonora touches it and sees a vision of fighting. She recoils from the knife then she runs from the house. Tessa tells Eleonora that Ranero, one of Alberto's brothers, says he wants to marry her and she returns his feelings. Siniscalco Barozzi reaches the camp of Barbarossa but The Emperor is not there so the scheming and cowardly Barozzi tells the substitute Rinaldo di Dassel that he has brought Milan's oath of allegiance to Barbarossa. Rinaldo takes the money, but says that Barbarossa is still coming to attack Milan. Barozzi returns to Milan to warn of the great size of the German army. In addition, they have a great many war machines. Barozzi implores the people to surrender Milan but they decide to fight, to Barozzi's irritation. In Verona at the Adige River, a new bridge has been built to the satisfaction of the Germans. They start crossing the bridge, but soon heavy log rams are send down the river to knock the bridge into sections. German horses and soldiers are tossed into the Adige River. For Verona siding with Milan and killing many German soldiers, Barbarossa cuts off the ear of one of the Verona emissaries. Eleonora runs to tell Alberto that the Germans have destroyed the city of Brescia with more than one thousand dead. Alberto says they are still going to fight to save Milan. Eleonora thinks the battle has already been lost. As Soldiers from the cities of Parma, Cremona, Padua and Ferrara are sent to join forces with Barbarossa, the Germans are approach Milan. The bells are rung and the people come into the fort. There is a moat around the fortified walls of the city. The Germans come forward to the moat behind moveable wooden walls. They start pushing giant kegs into the moat water. The Milanese archers try to kill the men working on the kegs, but the German have hundreds of crossbowmen firing arrows into the Milanese archers. Then fire balls are thrown against the Milanese walls and the Milanese buildings inside. The Milanese fight back with their own fire balls launched at the keg bearers. Barozzi asks for volunteers to go out and collect food for the people inside the walls. Alberto raises his hand to volunteer, but Barozzi chooses his brother Ranero instead, who did not raise his hand to volunteer. Alberto tells Barozzi to leave his brother alone so Barozzi says then Alberto will go instead of Ranero. Shamed into volunteering, Ranero says he is going for he wants no man to say that he lacks courage. Barozzi wants Ranero to go to battle and die so he can have Tessa all to himself but Tessa, disgusted by Barozzi's cynical manipulations, tells him that if Ranero does not return, she would rather die than be with him. The Germans then push their towers toward the walls of Milan. On the front of the towers they have tied the Millanese volunteers that went out in the fields to get fresh food for the residents of Milan. Orders are given not to shoot but Barozzi grabs a crossbow and shoots Ranero dead. Now others start shooting and most of the volunteers are killed. At night Alberto goes out and up to retrieve the bodies of his two brothers and swears vengeance for their deaths to his father. Eleonora tries to talk him out of going but he will not hear of it. Alberto slits the tent of Barbarossa and slips in, only to be confronted by Barbarossa who asks where he got his knife and Alberto says some time ago Barbarossa himself gave the knife to him. Out of gratitude for saving his life, Barbarossa lets Alberto go. As Alberto prepares to slip out of the German camp he sees Barozzi come into the camp. Alberto returns to his father, but now the Germans are pouring through the gates, led by Barozzi whom Alberto wants to kill but he is captured before he can. Alberto and all the other prisoners are brought before the Emperor, who burns the Milanese flag. He then says that all of Milan will be razed to the ground and all the Milanese must leave the area before sunset. In Rome Barbarossa chooses the new Pope and now the Pope crowns he and his wife the Emperor and Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, respectively. As the Emperor and Empress leave the coronations, a man falls dead in front of them. The Empress demands to know what happened to the man. A man looks the body over and says the man died of the plague. Barbarossa and his new Queen make plans to flee. At the Pontida Monastery, men from Milan hold a meeting together in secret. The men are very pessimistic about their chances of ever defeating Barbarossa and rebuilding Milan. Alberto and his friend burst into the meeting and Alberto shouts that they can defeat Barbarossa if they can just stay united and that this time all the cities of Lombardy will unite against the Germans. Alberto comes to see Eleonora at her father's house. Her asks her where Tessa is and Eleonora tells him she is dead when in fact Tessa has retired to a nunnery following the death of Ranero. Alberto plans to take Eleonora with him this time but Eleonora resists the idea saying that Alberto always treated her just like everyone else. Alberto apologizes to her. Alberto and Eleonora come to visit with Eleonora's sister- in-law when Barozzi and the imperial German soldiers arrive to collect the Emperor's share of the local harvest. Alberto tells Eleonora that the Germans treat them like animals and says that it is time to stop running and form an army. In Rome Barbarossa's men want to leave the plague infested city. His wife wants him to stay put, but Barbarossa sides with his men and says they are going home. Alberto tells his men that they will become the \\"Company of Death\\" and their motto shall be \\"Death or freedom\\". Alberto and his men start rallying volunteers, soon gathering a large force of Lombard men. Eleonora goes to see Tessa in the nunnery. She tells Tessa of the rise of the power of the Lombard League and Tessa tells Eleonora to marry Alberto. Alberto again asks Eleonora again to marry him and this time she agrees however soon after, Barozzi comes to the nunnery to take the Emperor's share of their bounty and to abduct attractive nuns. As Barozzi pulls off the veils of the nuns, he finds Tessa among them. He is ecstatic to find her but Tessa, aware that Barozzi killed her fianc√© slashes his face with a dagger and runs to the roof of the nunnery. There she stands on the ledge threatening to plunge to her death. Barozzi begs her not to do it, promising to change his dishonest ways but Tessa fulfils her vow and throws herself to her death rather than be forced to marry him. Far away, her sister senses the death of Tessa and weeps for her. Barozzi and Eleonora are at the funeral. Eleanora approaches Barozzi and he tearfully tells her that he loved Tessa. Blaming Barozzi for Tessa's suicide, Eleonora is unforgiving and slashes Barozzi's throat, non-fatally wounding him. News comes to Alberto that Eleonora almost killed Barozzi who has taken Eleonora to the camp of Barbarossa at Alessandria. There they plan to burn her at the stake. Alberto is enraged upon hearing the news. At The Empress is frightened by rumours that Eleanora is a witch while Barbarossa is upset because they have been trying for weeks to take the city without success. He tells his staff to double the digging of the tunnel. His staff tell him that the frequent rains have slowed the digging and the rivers around the city are filled up with water; if the rains continue the rivers will overflow and the whole camp will be submerged. In addition, the rain and mud are destroying the morale of the troops. The Empress goes to see Eleanora. She sees her right arm has been burned and asks what happened. Eleanora tells her that it is scarring from a lightning strike. The Empress is amazed. Eleonora's cellmate screams that the woman is a witch and she runs to the cell door banging hard on it to be let out. The Empress leaves the cell still wondering how the woman survived. The tunnel is discovered when there is a cave in opening up a large hole to the sky. When Barbarossa learns of this, he orders that the war machines all be set on fire. They are retreating. Barbarossa says they will retreat to Pavia in Lombardy. His wife advises him to send a message to his cousin Henry the Lion to bring fresh troops for the German army to which Barbarossa agrees but the Empress has an additional request; to free Eleanora because she believes that is protected by God but Barbarossa refuses. At the Mera River, Emperor Barbarossa and his troops arrive and Barbarossa asks his cousin Henry the Lion when he is going to give the army he promised him. Henry says that war is no longer a luxury that he can afford and he has no soldiers to give to Frederick, but he does have a small chest filled with coins with which Frederick can buy fresh troops. Possessed of great wealth already, Frederick growls that Henry is \\"useless\\" and leaves him behind. Barozzi arrives late to Eleanora's burning but a masked woman is on the pyre which is set alight. He does not see her face but is told that she is Eleanora. Alberto and the men of the Company of Death prepare to attack the forces of Barbarossa and beforehand Alberto gives his men a speech about fighting for their freedom. In Legnano, to the North of Milan, The German army faces what they think is only the Milanese army. They are roughly two miles away on the plain and Barbarossa is sure of victory. He gives the order to take the Empress to Pavia for her protection. He then leads the charge. The cavalry retreats and the Germans face the secret weapons of the scythes. The wagons filled with scythe-wielding men cut the cavalry down. Now with the German cavalry weakened the Lombard cavalry attacks them. In the battle Barozzi kills Lorenzo, Alberto's only remaining brother and attacks Alberto from behind, saying that he will send him to join his \\"whore in Hell.\\" Alberto rams into Barozzi who drops his sword and falls to the ground, his helmet rolling off as Alberto lands atop him. As Barozzi cries and pathetically begs for his life, Alberto avenges his brothers by slowly driving a stiletto knife into Barozzi's throat, killing him. The Lombards win the battle. Found on the battlefield is a wounded Eleonora in full uniform. She tells Alberto that the Empress saved her life by substituting another woman to be burned in her place and moving the time of her execution so that Barozzi and the Emperor would not find out. Alberto gets his wife back. The film ends with an onscreen text saying that three days after the battle of Legnano, Barbarossa reappeared at the court of Pavia. No one knows where he was or what he did during those three days. Fourteen years later, he left for the Crusades. On a spring evening, in Anatolia, he waded in the waters of the Salef River and, just as foretold, he met his death in the water after being bitten by a snake.

On 1 November 2008 the museum celebrated its 10th anniversary which included a display of vintage vehicles and costumed members of the Haddenham Players adding an historic falour to the event.Big weekend to mark Haddenham museum's birthday \\"Thame Gazette\\" Accessed, 2 October 2010.

A mostly white dog, he ran briefly with a hunting kennel before becoming a show dog, most notably with a victory at the show which popularised the Fox Terrier. His main show rivalry was with a dog named Tartar, and along with a dog named Trap, the three were popular sires of the Fox Terrier breed. He was also involved in the early formation of the Jack Russell Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier breeds. Early life According to the Kennel Club studbook, Old Jock was bred at some point during 1859 either by Captain Percy Williams in his Rufford Kennels, or by Jack Morgan who at the time was a huntsman with the Grove Kennels.Lee (1895): p. 31 He was bred from Jock and Grove Pepper, both huntsman's terriers.Lee (1895): p. 32 Jock was owned by Captain Williams, while Grove Pepper was owned by Morgan.Leighton (1910): p. 204 It was claimed in W.D. Drury's 1903 work British Dogs, Their Points, Selection, And Show Preparation that Old Jock was in fact bred from Quorn Kennels and that the listing in the Kennel Club studbook was incorrect. He was a mostly white terrier, weighing between during his lifetime. He had a tan mark on one ear, and a black patch near his stern and at the base of his tail. With strong legs and a well sprung chest, although it was noted that he had the appearance of having a missing rib when in thin condition. His ears were well placed with strong jaws and was described by dog author Rawdon Lee as being a \\"symmetrical terrier\\". Compared to his rival Tartar, he was considered to be far less of the Bull and terrier type. Old Jock ran two hunting seasons with the Grove Hunting Kennels and his tail was docked, although at a longer length than was considered normal at the time.Lee (1895): p. 33 Show career Jock's main rival in the show ring was a dog named Tartar, who was said to be more fond of ratting than his competitor. Jock was said to have never killed a rat; his ability to hunt Foxes was also thought to be a myth.Lee (1895): p. 35 In 1862 at the National Exhibition in Birmingham, a dog show was held with a class for the new breed listed as \\"White and Other Smooth-haired English Terriers, except Black and Tan\\".Lee (1895): p. 28 Several Fox Terriers were shown, with a total of twenty four entries in the class. Old Jock placed first, with Old Trap owned by Mr. Bayly coming second and Mr. Stevenson's Jack placing third. This was the first time that the Fox Terrier attracted public attention.Lee (1895): p. 29 At the Crystal Palace dog show in 1870, in what was considered to be the dog champion class of that time with the qualification requirement of a first place win at another show, Old Jock placed second. The winner was a black and tan terrier named Trimmer, with a line-up of notable dogs in the history of the Fox Terrier including Mr. Murchison's Old Trap; Mr. W.J. Harrison's Jocko; Mr. F Sale's Tyrant, Hornet and Tartar; the Marquis of Huntly's Bounce; Mr. Bewley and Mr. Carson's Quiz; and Mr. W. Gammon's Chance. This was the final time Old Jock was exhibited in the show ring. In total, Jock won 33 first prizes (of which 8 were champion classes) and 4 second prizes, starting at the 1862 Birmingham show until the 1870 Crystal Palace show. Death and legacy Old Jock (far left), Grove Nettle and Tartar, three of the dogs which have led to the modern Fox Terrier. Although Old Jock has already changed hands on several occasions, prior to the Crystal Palace Show of 1870 he was sold from Mr. W. Cropper to Mr. J.H. Murchinson for the sum of around ¬£60, which was supposedly the dog's weight in silver. It was in Murchinson's possession that Jock died in 1871. Three male dogs are considered to be the founding sires of the modern lines of Fox Terriers: Old Jock, Old Trap and Tartar. Of those three, Jock was considered to be more of a terrier than the other two.Leighton (1910): p. 203 Reverend John Russell, who kept his strain of terriers quite pure, once admitted that he had used Old Jock to breed certain qualities into his dogs.Dalziel (1897): p. 304 Jock was also used to breed certain elements into the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.Dalziel (1897): p. 316 The very first Fox Terriers in Australia were bred from Old Jock, Grove Nettle and their contemporaries.

The MVD, a successor agency to the NKVD, was established in March 1946. Unlike the NKVD, except for a period of about 12 months, from mid- March 1953 until mid-March 1954, the MVD did not include units (agencies) concerned with secret (political) activity, that function being assigned to the Ministry of State Security (MGB), and (from March 1954) to the Committee for State Security (KGB).  History  The Ministry of Internal Affairs was created on the basis of the USSR‚Ä≤s People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) on 15 March 1946, when all the People‚Ä≤s Commissariats were transformed into ministries. On 15 March 1953, the MGB was incorporated into the MVD,–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –°–°–°–† –æ—Ç 15.03.1953 –æ –ø—Ä–µ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤ –°–°–°–†–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –°–°–°–† –æ—Ç 15.03.1953 –û –≤–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏ –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–∏ 70, 77 –∏ 78 –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ü–∏–∏ (–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω–∞) –°–°–°–† and a year later the State Security agency was established as a separate state committee, the KGB. The MVD was originally established as a union-republic ministry with headquarters in Moscow, but in 1960 the Khrushchev leadership, as part of its general downgrading of the police, abolished the central MVD, whose functions were assumed by republic ministries of internal affairs. Then, in 1962 the MVD was redesignated the Ministry for the Preservation of Public Order (; Ministerstvo okhrany obshchestvennogo poriadka ‚Äî MOOP). This name change implied a break with the all-powerful MVD created by Beria, as well as a narrower range of functions. The changes were accompanied by increasing criticism of the regular police in the Soviet press for its shortcomings in combating crime. Following Khrushchev's ouster, Brezhnev did much to raise the status of the regular police. In 1966, after placing one of his proteges, Nikolai A. Shchelokov, in the post of chief, Brezhnev reinstated MOOP as a union-republic ministry. Two years later, MOOP was renamed the MVD, an apparent symbol of its increased authority. Efforts were made to raise the effectiveness of the MVD by recruiting better-qualified personnel and upgrading equipment and training. Brezhnev's death, however, left the MVD vulnerable to his opponents, Andropov in particular. Just a month after Brezhnev died, Shchelokov was ousted as its chief and replaced by the former KGB chairman, Vitalii Fedorchuk. Shchelokov was later tried on corruption charges. A similar fate befell Brezhnev's son-in-law, Iurii Churbanov, who was removed from the post of first deputy chief in 1984 and later arrested on criminal charges. After bringing several officials from the KGB and from the party apparatus into the MVD, Andropov sought to make it an effective organization for rooting out widespread corruption; Gorbachev continued these efforts. In January 1986, when Fedorchuk was retired, Aleksandr V. Vlasov was appointed the chief of the MVD. Vlasov had no background in the police apparatus. In September 1988, Vlasov became a candidate member of the CPSU Politburo, and the following month he was replaced as chief of the MVD by Vadim V. Bakatin. Interior minister Boris Pugo was one of the main organizers of the 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt; when the coup failed, he killed himself. He was replaced by Viktor Barannikov, who acted as the last interior minister of the Soviet Union.  Functions and organization  The MVD had a wide array of duties. It was responsible for uncovering and investigating certain categories of crime, apprehending criminals, supervising the internal passport system, maintaining public order, combating public intoxication, supervising parolees, managing prisons and labor camps, providing fire protection, and controlling traffic. Until early 1988, the MVD was also in charge of special psychiatric hospitals, but a law passed in January 1988 transferred all psychiatric hospitals to the authority of the Ministry of Health.  Internal security  As a union-republic ministry under the Council of Ministers, the MVD had its headquarters in Moscow and branches in the republic and regional government apparatus, as well as in oblasts and cities. Unlike the KGB, the internal affairs apparatus was subject to dual subordination; local internal affairs offices reported both to the executive committees of their respective local Soviets and to their superior offices in the MVD hierarchy. The MVD headquarters in Moscow was divided into several directorates and offices. The Directorate for Combating the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation was established in the late 1960s to control such white-collar crime as embezzlement and falsification of economic plan records. The Criminal Investigation Directorate assisted the Procuracy, and on occasion the KGB, in the investigation of criminal cases. There was a separate department for investigating and prosecuting minor cases, such as traffic violations, and the Maintenance of Public Order Directorate, which was responsible for ensuring order in public places and for preventing outbreaks of public unrest. The members of the militsiya (uniformed police), as part of the regular police force, were distinguished by their gray uniforms with red piping. The duties of the militsiya included patrolling public places to ensure order and arresting persons who violated the law, including vagrants and drunks. Resisting arrest or preventing a police officer from executing his duties was a serious crime in the Soviet Union, punishable by one to five years' imprisonment. Killing a policeman was punishable by death. The Office of Visas and Registration was charged with registering Soviet citizens and foreigners residing in each precinct of a city and with issuing internal passports to Soviet citizens. Soviet citizens wishing to emigrate from the Soviet Union and foreigners wishing to travel within the Soviet Union had to obtain visas from this office. The Office of Recruitment and Training supervised the recruitment of new members of the militsiya, who were recommended by work collectives and public organizations. The local party and Komsomol bodies screened candidates thoroughly to ensure their political reliability. Individuals serving in the militsiya were exempt from the regular military draft.

May 9, 893Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259.), formally the Prince of Julu (ÈâÖÈπøÁéã), was a warlord of the late Tang dynasty, who controlled Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) as its military governor (Jiedushi). He was eventually defeated by Zhu Quanzhong's general Pang Shigu (ÈæêÂ∏´Âè§), and committed suicide with his family.  Background and seizure of Ganhua Circuit  It is not known when Shi Pu was born, but it is known that he was from Pengcheng and served as an officer at Xu Prefecture (whose seat was at Pengcheng).Old Book of Tang, vol. 182. Both he and fellow officer Chen Fan () were favored by Zhi Xiang () the military governor (Jiedushi) of Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered at Xu Prefecture).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. In 881, after the agrarian rebel Huang Chao captured the imperial capital Chang'an, forcing then-ruling Emperor Xizong to flee, Zhi sent Shi and Chen with an army to try to aid the emperor. When Shi reached the eastern capital Luoyang, however, he claimed to receive an order from Zhi to withdraw, and after rendezvous with Chen, they slaughtered Heyin (Ê≤≥Èô∞, in modern Luoyang) and pillaged Zheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) before returning to Xu Prefecture. Zhi tried to placate them by treating them and their soldiers well, but Shi had his trusted soldiers meet with Zhi and threaten him, forcing him to yield the command to Shi, who took the title of acting military governor. Chen tried to persuade Shi to kill Zhi, pointing out that Zhi had treated the people of the circuit well and might be able to return to power. Shi refused, and instead had Zhi escorted to Emperor Xizong's then-location at Chengdu. On the way, however, Chen laid an ambush for Zhi and slaughtered his family. Subsequently, Emperor Xizong confirmed Shi as acting military governor and, later in the year, full military governor. (Shi made Chen the prefect of Su Prefecture (ÂÆøÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Anhui), but had him executed when he proved to be violent and corrupt as prefect.)  Campaign against Huang Chao  In spring 882, when Emperor Xizong commissioned the chancellor Wang Duo as the overall commander of the operations against Huang Chao, he gave Shi Pu the title of director of army supplies, under Wang's command. In 883, after Huang abandoned Chang'an and fled east, Shi mobilized his troops and stationed them at Yin River (Ê∫µÊ∞¥, a major branch of the Shaying River) to try to stop Huang's movement, and Emperor Xizong gave him the title of the commander on the eastern front. Around the same time, there was an incident where Shi suffered from food poisoning and suspected his staff member Li Ninggu () of poisoning him, and so put Li Ninggu to death. At that time, Li Ninggu's father Li Sun () was an advisory official at the imperial government. Shi accused Li Sun of being complicit and bribed the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi to have Li Sun put to death. Li Sun was arrested, but his life was spared due to the intercession of the chancellor Xiao Gou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. Meanwhile, Huang's army put Chen Prefecture () and its prefect Zhao Chou under siege. Shi, along with Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and Zhou Ji the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) all launched troops to try to save Zhao. Shi was said to have repeated victories over the armies of Huang and his vassal Qin Zongquan the military governor of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). However, these three military governors did not feel that they could stand up to Huang on their own, so they sought aid from Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) ‚Äî who had been instrumental in Tang's recapture of Chang'an. After Li Keyong arrived and defeated Huang's army at Chen Prefecture, Huang's major general Shang Rang surrendered to Shi. Li Keyong subsequently withdrew from the front after getting into a dispute with Zhu and surviving an assassination attempt Zhu made against him. Shi, however, continued the pursuit against Huang, and sent his officer Li Shiyue () and Shang to go after Huang. Huang fled into Langhu Valley (ÁãºËôéË∞∑, in modern Heze, Shandong), where his nephew Lin Yan () killed him, preparing to surrender his head to Shi ‚Äî but on the way, Lin was intercepted by irregular Shatuo (i.e., Li Keyong's soldiers left in the area) and Boye Army () soldiers, who killed him and seized Huang's head to present to Shi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. For Shi's contributions in destroying Huang, he was made acting Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, one of the Three Excellencies), given the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (), and created the Prince of Julu.  Campaign against Qin Zongquan  Despite Huang Chao's destruction, however, Qin Zongquan continued to retain an army and continued to pillage the nearby circuits, and in 885 claimed the title of emperor. Emperor Xizong commissioned Shi Pu to serve as the overall commander against Qin. (Despite Shi's title as overall commander, however, it is unclear what Shi's acts were during the subsequent Tang military actions against Qin were, as the historical records largely described only Zhu Quanzhong's battles with Qin.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. In 887, with Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) embroiled in warfare, with a number of parties contending for it (including Qin Yan, Yang Xingmi, and Qin Zongquan's general Sun Ru), the imperial government, intending to calm the warfare, made Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Huainan, in addition to Xuanwu. Zhu Quanzhong commissioned Yang, who had by that point captured Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (), deputy military governor and Li Fan () as acting military governor. Zhu wrote Shi Pu, requesting passage for Li Fan to pass through Ganhua on the way to Huainan, but Shi was resenting the fact that the imperial government gave the post of Huainan's military governorship to Zhu and not to him despite his higher seniority. When Li Fan reached Si Prefecture (Ê≥óÂ∑û, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui), which was part of Ganhua, Shi laid an ambush for him, which Li Fan was only able to escape due to the fervent fighting by the officer escorting him, Guo Yan (). From that point on, the rivalry between Xuanwu and Ganhua became open warfare. (Zhu was ultimately unable to take control of Huainan due to Yang's resistance and Shi's interference.) In spring 888, the imperial government replaced Shi as the overall commander against Qin Zongquan with Zhu. After Qin Zongquan suffered repeated defeats, his general Shen Cong () arrested him in late 888 and surrendered to Zhu. This led to a dispute between Zhu and Shi over whose accomplishment it was that Qin was destroyed, and their relationship deteriorated even more.  Campaign against Zhu Quanzhong  With Qin Zongquan destroyed, Zhu Quanzhong was able to act against Shi Pu. In spring 889, Zhu's officer Pang Shigu captured Suqian (ÂÆøÈÅ∑, in modern Suqian, Jiangsu), and advanced onto L√ºliang (ÂëÇÊ¢Å, in modern Xuzhou). Shi tried to engage him, but was defeated and forced to flee back to Xu Prefecture. Another Xuanwu officer, Zhu Zhen () then captured Xiao (Ëï≠Á∏£, in modern Suzhou). Zhu Quanzhong himself soon arrived, killed Zhu Zhen for killing another officer Li Tangbin (), and then tried to attack Shi himself, but encountered torrential rains and withdrew. When Shi asked for aid from Li Keyong, Li Keyong sent his officer Shi Junhe () to aid Shi Pu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In summer 890, Zhang Yun (), an officer at Su Prefecture, which had apparently fallen to Zhu Quanzhong earlier, expelled the Zhu Quanzhong-commissioned prefect Zhang Shaoguang () and reverted the allegiance to Shi Pu. Zhu Quanzhong, in response, attacked Su Prefecture himself. When Shi Pu tried to aid Zhang Yun by pillaging Dangshan (Á¢≠Â±±, in modern Suzhou), Zhu Quanzhong sent his son Zhu Youyu to engage Shi Pu. Zhu Youyu defeated Shi Pu, capturing Shi Junhe in the battle. In summer 891, Zhu Quanzhong's officer Ding Hui put Su Prefecture under siege. Zhang Yun surrendered to Ding in winter 891, and Shi Pu's officer Liu Zhijun subsequently surrendered to Zhu Quanzhong as well. It was said that Liu's surrender dealt a heavy blow to Shi Pu's army, which was not able to recover from it. The protracted warfare between Xuanwu and Ganhua laid waste the three prefectures that Ganhua still controlled at that point ‚Äî Xu, Si, and Hao (Êø†Â∑û, in modern Chuzhou), leaving the farmers unable to farm and the food supplies dwindling, particularly in light of major flooding in spring 892. Forces that Li Keyong, Zhu Xuan the military governor of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), and Zhu Xuan's cousin Zhu Jin the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) sent were all unable to help Shi fight Zhu's attack off. In spring 892, Shi sought a peaceful resolution, and Zhu agreed, but required that as part of the resolution, Shi be recalled to the imperial government and that the imperial government send a replacement for Shi. When Zhu reported this resolution to the imperial government, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) commissioned the chancellor Liu Chongwang as Shi's replacement and recalled Shi to Chang'an to serve as a senior advisor to the Crown Prince ‚Äî an honorary position. Shi, however, became fearful that Zhu was only intending to trick him into leaving Xu Prefecture and then kill him once he left, and therefore refused to yield his post to Liu. Liu thus returned to Chang'an. Meanwhile, Shi had sent an army south to capture Chu Prefecture (Ê•öÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), which Zhu had taken over. In summer 892, Yang Xingmi sent his officers Zhang Xun () and Li Decheng to contend for Chu as well, and they defeated Shi's army and then captured Chu Prefecture, capturing its Zhu-commissioned prefect Liu Zan (). In winter 892, Zhang Sui () the prefect of Hao Prefecture and Zhang Jian () the prefect of Si Prefecture surrendered to Zhu, leaving Shi only in control of Xu. Zhu Quanzhong had sent Zhu Youyu to attack Tianping's Pu Prefecture (ÊøÆÂ∑û, in modern Heze) earlier, and after Zhu Youyu captured Pu Prefecture around the same time, Zhu Quanzhong sent him to Xu to command the siege against Shi Pu. In spring 893, Shi counterattacked and killed Guo Yan at Su Prefecture. With Zhu Jin arriving with an aid force from Taining, Zhu Youyu and another Xuanwu officer, Huo Cun (), engaged Shi and Zhu Jin, defeating them. Zhu Jin fled back to Taining, although Shi subsequently killed Huo in battle. Subsequently, Zhu Youyu again put Xu Prefecture under siege, refusing to engage Shi when Shi challenged him. Zhu Quanzhong's adoptive son Zhu Yougong () thus falsely accused Zhu Youyu of being complicit with Shi and Zhu Jin. Zhu Quanzhong nearly killed Zhu Youyu, but subsequently released him and replaced him with Pang. Pang continued to siege Xu for months and finally captured it. Shi took his family and ascended Swallow Tower (), and then set a fire to kill themselves in the fire. Zhu Quanzhong took over Ganhua.

It grows on conifer stumps or logs in North America, producing a cream white fruit body up to tall and wide. It fruits from after the start of the fall rains to mid-season. Taxonomy The species was first described as Hydnum abietis by American botanist James Robert Weir in 1931. Weir collected the type specimens in 1916, near the Priest River in Idaho. Kenneth Archibald Harrison transferred it to the genus Hericium in 1964. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"bear's head\\" or the \\"western coral hedgehog\\". Description Hericium abietis mushroom growing on a log in Northwestern British Columbia. Note, there is also a bracket mushroom growing in the background on the same log. The fruit body forms a compact, branched mass with long spines hanging down. The branches originate from a single, thick, tough base. The color of the fruit body ranges from white to creamy, light yellowish, to salmon-buff. The hanging spines are usually long, although some may be as long as ; they are soft and brittle, and typically grow as clusters at the tips of the branches. Typically, fruit bodies have dimensions in the range of tall and wide, but they have been known to attain massive sizes; one noted specimen was about . Hericium abietis produces a white spore print. Spores are spherical or nearly so, smooth to slightly roughened, amyloid, and measure 4.5‚Äì5.5 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm. The hyphae are monomitic (consisting of only generative hyphae), and they have clamp connections. =Similar species= Hericium erinaceus is a lookalike spine fungus. It can be distinguished by its more compact fruit body structure that lacks multiple branches, in which the hanging spines all originate from a single thick tubercle. In Hericium coralloides, the spines line the undersides of the branches, unlike H. abietis, whose spines are arranged in clusters at the tip of branches. =Edibility= Hericium abietis is edible and choice. David Arora suggests that cooking the mushroom produces a flavor similar to fish, and that it is suitable for sauteing, marinating, or preparing as a curry dish. Habitat and distribution Hericium abietis causes a white pocket rot of conifers; this is a form of wood decay featuring a selective attack on lignin and hemicellulose in wood. The fruit bodies grow singly or occasionally in small groups on the dead wood of conifers, especially fir and Douglas fir. It can also be cultivated on conifer sawdust. The species is found throughout North America.

Early life Born in Strathglass, Inverness on 2 July 1818, he was the son William MacDonald and Harriet MacDonald (n√©e Fraser). His early education was at the local school, before being sent to the Scots Seminary in Ratisbon in 1830, where he remained there for the next seven years. On 6 June 1837, he entered the Scots College in Rome, and took the oath there on 22 April 1838. Priestly career He was ordained a subdeacon in the chapel of the Congregation of the Nobles, at the Ges√π, on 10 May 1840. He left the Scots College on 11 June 1840, and returned to Scotland, where he was ordained a deacon in 1841, and later in the same year, ordained a priest on 4 November 1841. Between 1841 and 1868, he served in a number of missions in Scotland. He was an assistant at Tombae, Banffshire (December 1842 to February 1842); Glenmoriston, Inverness-shire (February 1842 to May 1844) and Dornie Kintail, Ross-shire (1843 to May 1844); and Braemar, Aberdeenshire (May 1844 to May 1845). He was an assistant at Inverness (May 1845 to May 1846), then had sole charge of that mission (1846 to 1848). Finally, he was in charge of the missions at Fassnakyle in Upper Strathglass (summer 1848 to Whit Sunday 1856), and at Eskadale in Lower Strathglass (1856 to 1868). Episcopal career He was appointed the Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District and Titular Bishop of Nicopolis ad Iaterum by the Holy See on 11 December 1868.

The company uses a special electroplating technology to utilize nearly 100% of its materials. SoloPower is based in San Jose, California, and has achieved the distinction of being the first company to obtain UL Certification of CIGS flexible solar panels in 2010. This was lauded as a significant achievement by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Later the same year, the company also received IEC Certification (IEC 61646 and 61730) of its flexible CIGS solar panels, again an industry first. In March 2012, the company's modules set a world record aperture efficiency of 13.4% for flexible CIGS Solar Panels, as measured by NREL. Company history SoloPower was founded by Bulent Basol and Homayoun Talieh in 2005. The company started its pilot manufacturing line in December of the same year. In 2010, the company secured $45 million in debt financing and used $19.9 million of that to acquire the shares of ousted founders Talieh and Basol. In 2010, SoloPower held talks with the town of Wilsonville, Oregon to set up a manufacturing plant there. In 2011, the United States Department of Energy approved a $197 Million Loan Guarantee to the company, enabling a 400MW manufacturing plant in Oregon. In May 2011, SoloPower decided to move the manufacturing facility to Portland instead. In April, 2013, SoloPower announced plans to suspend operations at the Portland plant and gut the remaining workforce. SoloPower was announced a winner of the 2012 TiE50 award in the category of Clean Energy. The company closed its doors in later 2017 and no longer operational. Funding The Norwegian firms Convexa Capital, Spencer Energy and Scatec have invested approximately $30 Million into SoloPower in 2007. The United States Department of Energy funded the company with $197 million from the same program that funded Solyndra, as have the City of Portland and agencies in the State of Oregon, which provided $56.5 million, and the California Energy Commission. In early 2011, the company received $13.5 Million from Crosslink Capital. Lead investors in the company include Hudson Clean Energy Partners, Crosslink Capital, Convexa, and Firsthand. In the summer of 2017, the State of Oregon's Department of Energy paid $641,835 to cover SoloPower's back rent. Governments pay for defaults The City of Portland pays $119,000 per month until late 2020 to cover for SoloPower's default on a loan the City guaranteed under Mayor Sam Adams in 2011. The money is taken out of Portland's Bureau of Transportation. The Bureau of Transportation pays because parking-meter revenue was used as guaranty.

Hsaing waing musicians use a hemitonic and anhemitonic scale similar to the one used by Indonesian gamelan musicians. The ensemble's principal instruments, including the pat waing, kyi waing, and hne, each play variations on a single melody (heterophony). is the product of indigenous musical traditions enriched with contact with a diverse array of musical traditions in neighboring Southeast Asian societies. The hsaing waing ensemble's principal instrument, a drum circle called pat waing, continues to use Indian drum-tuning methods, is considered the remaining vestige of Indian instrumentation in Southeast Asia. Similar gong and chime ensembles are found in neighboring Thailand and Laos, where it is called piphat, and in Cambodia, where it is called pinpeat. However, these ensembles do not employ the use of a pat waing.The three major indigenous genres of gong-chime music prevalent in Southeast Asia include the gamelan of western Indonesia; the kulintang of the southern Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and eastern Malaysia; and the piphat of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and the hsaing waing of Burma.A 19th century watercolor depicts hsaing waing musicians accompanying a zat pwe drama performance. The earliest pictorial evidence of the hsaing waing ensemble dates to the 1600s, coinciding with the Burmese invasion of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which may have introduced additional instruments, principally a gong chime called kyi waing. However, the hsaing waing differs greatly in its diversity of instruments and musical style from Thai ensembles. Many of the hsaing waing instruments are shared with the Thai piphat mon ensemble of Mon origin, indicating shared origins. During the British colonial era, Sein Beda, a prominent musician, introduced various innovations to the ensemble, including decorating ensemble stands with traditional Burmese motifs and glass mosaic, introducing a jazz band to the ensemble, creating spotlights, and introducing musician uniforms.  Instrumentation  A 19th century watercolor depicting components of the hsaing waing ensemble.The hsaing waing ensemble includes a variety of percussion and wind instruments, including various gongs and drums: *Pat waing (·Äï·Äê·Ä∫·Äù·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) or pat lon (·Äï·Äê·Ä∫·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏) - a set of 18 to 21 drums in a circle with a range of more than 3 octaves *Kyi waing (·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä±·Ä∏·Äù·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - small bronze gongs in a circular frame *Maung hsaing (·Äô·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - a gong chime made of larger bronze gongs in a rectangular frame *Wa letkhot (·Äù·Ä´·Ä∏·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÅ·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫, lit. \\"bamboo clapper\\") - wooden clappers *Hne (·Äî·Äæ·Ä≤) - double reed oboe *Si (·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏) - bell *Wa (·Äù·Ä´·Ä∏) - clapper *Si to (·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ) *Lingwin (·Äú·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÄ·ÄΩ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - cymbals *Sakhun (·ÄÖ·ÄÅ·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫) - a double-headed drum on a stand *Chauk lon pat (·ÄÅ·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äï·Äê·Ä∫, lit. \\"six drums\\") - a set of eight tuned drums *Pat ma gyi (·Äï·Äê·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏) - a big drum suspended from a pole frame depicting a mythical pyinsarupa *Min pauk (·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Ä±·Ä´·ÄÄ·Ä∫, lit. \\"lord's entrance\\") - entryway made in the panels, forming the framework of a drum-circle For more formal and classical performances, the ensemble may be accompanied by the saung gauk, the Burmese harp, the pattala, a Burmese xylophone, or the piano and violin, both of which were introduced during the colonial era. The Mon version of the hsaing waing ensemble also includes a crescent-shaped brass gong chime called la gyan hsaing in Burmese. = Types = Music from the hsaing waing ensemble accompanies singing, dancing, and dialogues in all types of theatrical performances. Burmese scholarship recognizes 5 main types of hsaing waing ensembles: #Bala hsaing (·Äó·Äú·Ä¨·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - performed at celebratory occasions such as weddings, Buddhist ordainment rituals (shinbyu), ear-piercing ceremonies, funerals, lethwei competitions, and pagoda commemorations #Zat hsaing (·Äá·Ä¨·Äê·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - accompanies traditional dramatic theatre and play performances #Yokthe hsaing (·Äõ·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äû·Ä±·Ä∏·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - accompanies classical marionette (puppetry) shows #Nat hsaing (·Äî·Äê·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - accompanies spirit propitiation rituals #Anyeint hsaing (·Ä°·ÄÑ·Äº·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∑·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - accompanies traditional anyeint performances The distinct repertoire of recognizable tunes accompanies of each of these types of hsaing waing ensembles.  Musical styles  Music of the hsaing waing is characterized by dynamic, lively and sudden contrasts and shifts in rhythm, melody and tempo. The melody typically follows a regular meter of 4 to 8 beats. Anyeint dance performances, as well as nat gadaw and marionette puppet performances, are accompanied by the music of the hsaing waing, with the sudden shifts in musical rhythm reflected in the dancer's changing poses. The melody is shaped by tones; a complex system of pitches, principal and auxiliary tones, and melodic phrase terminals (cadential formulas), ornaments, and the vocal lines are associated with particular modes, which are context- driven (depending on environment and stage situations) and express varying emotions. The gong instrumentation provide repetitive motifs (see ostinato) during the course of a performance. By contrast, classical singing of the MahƒÅgƒ´ta tradition derived from royal chamber music, which is characterized by a quieter and more restrained musical style, is accompanied by either a classical ensemble or a single saung gauk.

Built in 1892, it is one of three surviving Parker truss bridges in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It now carries foot traffic only. Description and history The Drake Hill Road Bridge is located a short way southeast of the town center of Simsbury. It is located between Old Bridge Road, a former alignment of Drake Hill Road, and Riverside Road, which parallels the east bank of the Farmington River. Drake Hill Road now passes to the north, crossing the river on a modern bridge. This bridge is a single-span, pin-connected Parker through truss constructed with wrought iron, cast iron and steel. It rests on brownstone abutments and carries a roadway for a span of . and It has a wooden plank deck suitable for foot traffic, and its sides are adorned with planters that are seasonally filled with flowers. The bridge was built in 1892, and is one of three 19th- century Parker trusses to survive in the state. All three were designed by J.H. Buddington, an engineer for the state highway department. This bridge was built as a replacement for a timber-frame bridge that previously stood on the site. The town recognized the need for replacing the older structure in 1890, but financing of the replacement delayed its construction. The bridge was taken out of vehicular service in 1992, when the present alignment of Drake Hill Road was established. This bridge is now open strictly for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

Biography Morris was born in Philadelphia and educated at The Haverford School and Yale University, graduating in 1997. He then studied at Somerville College, Oxford on a grant from the British Academy where he was active with OUDS as a writer and performer. Morris' plays are noteworthy for their willingness to address difficult political topics, including the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse in Guardians and the murder of James Bulger in \\"The Age of Consent\\". He is additionally known for his innovative adaptations of work by previous writers, including Aristophanes, Gilbert and Sullivan, and Maurice Maeterlinck. Morris has been included as part of the British school of \\"In- Yer-Face Theatre\\" by critic Aleks Sierz. =Career= The Age of Consent Morris' play The Age of Consent, starring Ben Silverstone and Katherine Parkinson, \\"generated enormous controversy\\" on its premiere at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2001, due to its examination of the aftermath of the murder of James Bulger, and led to calls for a public boycotthttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Hlbva8TD_2MJ:www.thefreelibrary.com/Outrage%2Bover%2Bfestival's%2BBulger%2B'comedy%2B'-a077005376+%22Age+of+consent%22+morris+%22Denise+Fergus%22&cd;=9&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=us\\">Outrage over festival's Bulger 'comedy ' after the play's sympathetic stance towards the ten-year-old children convicted of Bulger's murder was publicly condemned by the mother of James Bulger as \\"sick and pathetic\\", but the play was publicly defended by the director of the Edinburgh Fringe, who stated that \\"controversy is always a part of the festival and it would not be the fringe festival if some difficult issues were not being tackled\\". Morris was invited by The Guardian to speak about the controversy himself on the newspaper's comment page, where, in a piece entitled \\"In Defence of My Play\\", he claimed that: \\"‚Ä¶what I sense‚Ä¶is an attack on my desire, if not my right, to handle this topic in a play. And here I must stand up for what theatre does. Theatre remains our best, our most prodigious and elastic forum for moral inquiry. An audience gathers to assert its power of judgment.\\" Morris was publicly defended by a number of prominent playwrights, including David Edgar. The production transferred to London's Bush Theatre, where New York Times critic Ben Brantley claimed that Morris was part of a new generation of \\"angry young men\\" in British theatre, \\"as explosive, nihilistic and exasperated as ever\\"‚Äîfailing to note that, while the play was set in contemporary England, the writer was, in fact, not English but American. In a later interview with the New Statesman, Morris claimed \\"I really don't have any choice but to continue working in London because the kind of stuff I want to write won't be produced in the US.\\"http://www.newstatesman.com/200608070032 The Age of Consent was later staged in Dublin, Rome, Berlin, Tokyo, and Sydney. The 2008 Australian production generated similar controversy to the premiere, with condemnation from the tabloid newspapers that \\"the murderers of British toddler Jamie Bulger are being given a sympathetic treatment\\" Guardians Morris' play Guardians, which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2005, won the Fringe First Award and the Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award, and transferred to London later that year. The play received its American premiere with The Culture Project in New York City in 2006, starring Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig, directed by Jason Moore. The play was praised by Karen J. Greenberg‚ÄîExecutive Director of the Center on Law and Security at the NYU School of Law and the author of The Torture Papers: The Road to Abu Ghraib, The Torture Debate in America, and Al Qaeda Now‚Äîin an article where she claims that the play represents a \\"truly profound\\" analysis of America's role in, and response to, the Abu Ghraib scandal. Greenberg's article, entitled \\"Split Screens\\", originally appeared in The American Prospect magazine; it is included in a 2007 book of essays entitled \\"One of the Guys: Women as Aggressors and Torturers\\", edited by Tara McKelvey with foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich and afterword by Cynthia Enloe. Greenberg's essay concludes with this praise for the play: \\"Who, really, are the victimizers? ... The answer is complex, but would come to light with some clarity in an independent investigation or Congressional inquiry ... Until this occurs, however, the American public will have to glean what it can from the words of a playwright.\\" (Greenberg, \\"Split Screens\\") Other Plays His play Gaudeamus, a contemporary adaptation of the Assemblywomen by Aristophanes, was staged at the Arcola in London in 2006, starring Kika Markham and Chipo Chung. Morris was a founding member of the Obie-winning theatre company The Civilians, and worked with them on two productions, Gone Missing and Nobody's Lunch. From 2003 to 2007, Morris taught as writer-in- residence at LAMDA, where he staged A Million Hearts for Mosley, which used the music from The Yeomen of the Guard by Gilbert and Sullivan to stage an exploration of the British Union of Fascists and the careers of Sir Oswald Mosley and his wife Diana Mosley. Morris' adaptation of La Mort de Tintagiles by Maurice Maeterlinck, entitled \\"The Death of Tintagel\\", was published in The Paris Review in 2003, and will be staged for the first time in London in autumn 2010, at People Show Studios, produced by Saltpeter Productions and directed by Vik Sivalingam. Criticism Morris has written criticism for various publications in England including Aret√©, the Guardian, the Observer, and the Independent. At Yale Morris was a student of Harold Bloom: later Morris published a lengthy response to Bloom's work The Anxiety of Influence, entitled \\"Harold Bloom, Parody, and the Other Tradition\\", in The Salt Companion to Harold Bloom, a seventy-fifth birthday festschrift for Bloom. Morris' extremely negative response to Bloom's later work is acknowledged by Harold Bloom in his \\"Afterword\\" to the volume, where Bloom stated that \\"I note that one contribution to this volume suggests that I have become a Moldy Fig, a term applied to Dixielanders by the great Bop jazz artists of my youth\\". This is a response to Morris' claim that Bloom's work, in The Western Canon and afterward, is \\"frankly jejune\\", referring to Bloom as \\"a latter-day Mortimer J. Adler garbed in the ill-fitting mantle of Ecclesiastes, author of works like How to Read and Why and Where Shall Wisdom be Found?, in which Bloom does for the great writers what Liberace did for the great composers.\\" Television Morris was a contestant on the 1989 Jeopardy! Teen Tournament, and was invited back for the 1998 Jeopardy! Teen Reunion Tournament. On both occasions he informed Alex Trebek that his future career plans included the Papacy. As a television writer, Morris wrote for the fourth and final season of Born and Bred on the BBC. From 2007 to 2010, he wrote for all three seasons of Katy Brand's Big Ass Show on ITV, and additionally performed as a member of the show's ensemble cast.

The North Jersey Rail Commuter Association is a not for profit (501(c)(3)) railroad advocacy organization that was formed and incorporated in the United States in 1980. During its history, the organization and its members have been involved in the successful advocacy of a number of projects involving NJ Transit Rail Operations. NJRCA's headquarters are located in Knowlton Township, New Jersey.  Origins and mission  NJRCA's mission is to advocate, in a non-partisan manner, rail projects that benefit New Jersey by educating public officials and the general public. This advocacy includes the preservation of existing rail infrastructure wherever possible; and the initiation, reactivation or augmentation of rail service wherever practicable. The first NJRCA president, Frederick H. Wertz, helped establish the organization in 1980, which was initially headquartered in Sparta, New Jersey. Since that time, the organization has helped advocate a number of rail projects in New Jersey, particularly northern New Jersey. Charles Walsh assumed the presidency of the organization in 1988, and has held that position since that time. The organization's vice-president is Donald J. Barnickel, P.E., who also assumed the vice presidency in 1988.  Rail projects advocated  Over time, NJRCA has advocated a number of projects involving NJ Transit Rail Operations (or other entities), including the restoration of rail service on the Lackawanna Cut-Off; the extension of service to Hackettstown, New Jersey; creation of Midtown Direct service (via the Kearny Connection) to New York City; creation of service via the Montclair Connection, the opening of NYS&W; railroad service through Northern New Jersey; the building of a NJ Transit rail yard in Morrisville, PA; and the preservation of the Sussex Branch Trail. The group was also successful in spearheading a 1989 state bond issue that set aside $25 million for the acquisition of railroad right-of-ways in the State of New Jersey. Additionally, the group has advocated for the creation of a railroad and transportation museum in New Jersey and was successful in gaining support for designating the museum jointly in Netcong-Port Morris and Phillipsburg.  Lackawanna Cut-Off project  Promoting the restoration of service on the Lackawanna Cut-Off on-air in 1989 on WFMV, 106.3 FM, a radio station in located in the Blairstown train station (l to r): Lawrence Wills, chairman, Monroe County Railroad Authority; Maurice Lewis, Penn-Jersey Rail Coalition; Frederick H. Wertz and Charles Walsh, NJRCA.Since its creation in 1980, NJRCA has spearheaded the effort to preserve and reactivate the Lackawanna Cut-Off. In 1979, as a result of a consolidation of Conrail's east-west rail routes, freight service was discontinued on the Cut-Off. This occurred in the aftermath of Conrail's taking over the operation of the line from the Erie Lackawanna Railroad in 1976. Passenger service on the line ceased in January 1970. The discontinuation of freight service on the Cut-Off opened the door for possible abandonment of the route and removal of the tracks on the line. Removal of narrow overhead road bridges on the Cut-Off, such as this one, the Route 521 bridge over the Cut-Off in Blairstown, New Jersey, became a major concern after abandonment of the line. When a bridge was functionally obsolete, as this one was, its replacement became a priority, which with an abandoned railroad might lead to the removal of the bridge and filling in and paving the road on top of what would become a blockage to the right-of-way below. One of NJRCA's initiatives was to advocate the replacement of overhead bridges with overhead bridges. NJRCA participated in meetings that were held between 1980 and 1984 in an effort to obtain funding to purchase the 88-mile (142 km) rail corridor between Port Morris Jct (NJ) and Scranton, Pennsylvania, which included the 28-mile (45 km) long Cut-Off between Port Morris Junction and Slateford Junction (PA). Funding was sought in New Jersey via the Sussex County Board of Chosen Freeholders, the Morris County Board of Transportation, and the Morris County, NJ Board of Chosen Freeholders; and in Pennsylvania via the Monroe County Railroad Authority (the predecessor of the Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority). In the end, sufficient funding could not be obtained, and the tracks on the Cut-Off were removed during the summer and fall of 1984. Conrail also indicated that it intended to remove the 60-mile (97 km) stretch of double track between Slateford, Pennsylvania, and Scranton, Pennsylvania; however, Conrail was persuaded to remove only one of the tracks, leaving an intact single-track railroad in Pennsylvania. In 1985, Conrail announced that it had sold the right-of-way of the Cut-Off to two developers, Gerald Turco and Burton Goldmeier. Goldmeier had acquired the easternmost mile (1.6 km) of the Cut-Off, while Turco had acquired the remaining 26-mile (44 km) section of the line in New Jersey and approximately one-mile (1.6 km) section in Pennsylvania. By 1986, Turco had announced a proposal to use the Cut-Off as a source for fill material and to use the \\"cuts\\" on the Cut-Off as construction landfills. This triggered a negative public reaction, and a push to have the State of New Jersey acquire the Cut-Off through eminent domain. From 1987 to 1989, representatives from NJRCA met with public officials in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania in an effort to solidify support for preserving the line and, in New Jersey, to support the creation of a state bond issue to fund the state's acquisition of the Cut-Off. An agreement was struck with then-New Jersey Assemblyman Chuck Haytaian to support the extension of NJ Transit rail service to Hackettstown, New Jersey, in turn for his support of the Lackawanna Cut-Off project and the bond issue. During the same timeframe, NJRCA also met several times with Turco in an effort to dissuade him from pursuing the destruction of the Cut-Off. As such, a state bond issue was successfully approved by the voters in New Jersey in November, 1989, which set aside $25 million for the purchase of rail rights-of-way in New Jersey. Starting in 1990, the New Jersey Department of Transportation initiated the use of eminent domain against Turco and Goldmeier, resulting in the State of New Jersey acquiring the right-of-way for a total of $21 million in 2001. At present, NJRCA continues to work with public officials in advocacy for the reactivation of the Lackawanna Cut-Off, specifically, at this point, the extension of rail service to Andover, NJ. However, the group will continued to be involved in the advocacy for the extension of service along the entire length of the Cut-Off in New Jersey for the foreseeable future.  Railroad museum activities  The Netcong-Port Morris logo showing the three rail routes that could be used from the Netcong- Port Morris site.With its rich transportation history, and the lack of a unifying entity to preserve it, rail and transportation advocates in New Jersey began seeking support for the creation of a state museum during the 1980s. An independent state commission was created by an act of the New Jersey State Legislature in 1986. The 16-member body was charged with identifying a site as well as funding for the museum. In 1989, the commission recommended that an unspecified site in Flemington, New Jersey, be designated as the museum's home. With no funding available, however, the idea of creating such a museum was temporarily set aside. In 1996, NJRCA President Charles Walsh was nominated to serve on a newly constituted state commission that would revisit the creation of a state railroad and transportation museum in New Jersey. New Jersey State Senator Thomas Gagliano (R-Middlesex) speaks at Netcong Station in May 1988 prior to the New Jersey State Railroad & Transportation Museum Commission boarding an excursion train for Dover, NJ and return. Also in the photo are Morris County Freeholder Patrick Hyland (right) and Frelinghuysen Township, New Jersey Mayor Charles Rydell (left). Shortly thereafter, NJRCA helped establish the Netcong-Port Morris (N-PM) Site Committee. The N-PM Site Committee's main responsibility was to act as a liaison between the museum commission and the towns‚ÄîNetcong, NJ and Roxbury Township, New Jersey‚Äîthat would be home to the museum. In addition to representatives from NJRCA, the committee had representatives from Netcong Boro and Roxbury Township, members of the railfan community, canal enthusiasts, Amtrak, preservationists, and other ad hoc members from the region. In October, 1998, the commission's chairman, Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, announced that the choice had been narrowed down to three sites in New Jersey: Phillipsburg, Plainfield and Netcong-Port Morris. By the time this announcement was made, it had become clear that the majority of members on the NJ State Railroad & Transportation Museum Commission were in favor of placing the museum in Phillipsburg. Subsequently, in early 1999, DeCroce permitted a vote to take place that designated Phillipsburg as the museum site. Walsh, however, continued to openly support the Netcong-Port Morris site, leading to his not being reappointed to the commission when his term expired later that year. Walsh's seat on the commission was filled by transportation magnate Anthony Imperatore.Frederick Wertz at the Netcong, NJ train station after greeting members of the New Jersey State Railroad & Transportation Museum Commission in May 1988. As such, Walsh, in conjunction with NJRCA and the N-PM Site Committee continued to advocate for the Netcong-Port Morris site and in the process gained the support of New Jersey State Senate leader Robert Littell, who at that time was the chairman of the New Jersey Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, and who struck an agreement with DeCroce to amend proposed legislation from the New Jersey General Assembly to designate both Phillipsburg and Netcong-Port Morris as joint sites for the museum. The legislation was subsequently signed into law in 2001.http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/ Senate Bill S1694, session of 2000-2001. Since that time, there has been activity within Phillipsburg to attempt to build the museum there, although the originally envisioned site, which is privately owned, was never acquired by the state of New Jersey and has since been designated for other purposes. In Netcong, there has been little activity thus far, although with the reactivation of the Lackawanna Cut-Off it is envisioned that the train station in Netcong could act as the eastern terminus for Steamtown train excursions from Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Proposals for current and future projects  In addition to the Lackawanna Cut-Off project, NJRCA has advocated the Gateway Tunnel (formerly known as the ARC Tunnel), including the proposal for run-through tracks at Penn Station, New York, with a connection to Grand Central Station. NJRCA has also proposed weekend rail service be instituted along the entire length of NJ Transit's Montclair- Boonton Line; that the Montclair-Boonton Line between Great Notch, NJ and Denville, New Jersey be electrified; and that all or part of NJ Transit's Gladstone Branch be double-tracked.

Following the death of founding President Morris K. Jesup in 1908, he became President of the Peary Arctic Club, which had been formed in 1898 to give Admiral Robert E. Peary financial backing in his polar quest. Even after this quest had ended in success Hubbard's interest in the frozen north did not end, and he was one of the financial contributors to the Donald B. MacMillan expedition in the Arctic studying the native tribes. \\"Favor Peary's Proof Against Dr. Cook\\", The New York Times, Oct 5, 1909 Early life Hubbard was born in Hallowell, Maine, December 20, 1838. He was the second son of Maine governor Dr. John Hubbard, who signed the unpopular Maine Liquor Law in 1851. After graduating from Bowdoin College in 1857 and studying law, he was admitted to the bar. He then moved to New York and began studies at Albany Law School.

He gave the law up in 1894 in order to devote more time to his numerous business interests, including management of the estate of railroad magnate Mark Hopkins. He was Vice President of the Southern Pacific Company between 1896 and 1900, President of the Mexican International Railroad between 1894 and 1901 and from 1901 to 1912 of the Guatemala Central Railroad. From 1904 he was president of the International Banking Corporation (subsequently merged into the company now known as Citibank) and was a director of the American Light and Traction Company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, National Bank of Commerce in New York, Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad Company, Wabash Railroad Company and the Western Union Telegraph Company. Hubbard was a philanthropist to many causes. Bowdoin College was a favorite object of his benefactions, and among the donations that remain are the splendid Hubbard Free Library and the fine grand stand which displays the motto, \\"Fair Play, and May the Best Man Win.\\" A more enduring monument is Cape Thomas Hubbard, which, from the wind-swept coast of Grant Land, faces the North Pole across reaches of grinding pack-ice, over which Robert E. Peary, another Bowdoin man, carried the Stars and Stripes in 1909. Hubbard died in New York City on May 19, 1915. At the time of his death, he was commander-in-chief of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Notes References * Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands.

The Burgos Pointer (), also called the Burgalese Pointer, is a breed of dog native to Spain. Originating from Castile, especially in the province of Burgos, this hardy breed is used for hunting and has some outstanding features for small game. History and origin of the breed The breed dates back to the 16th century and originates in the Castilian plateau, which is very widespread. It is very probable that the breed participated in the creation of other races of this group. The breed is believed to have descended from a mix of the Sabueso Espa√±ol and the Pachon Navarra (also known as the Perros de Punta Ibericos). Description The figure of the Burgos Pointer is perhaps not so style crystallized as other breeds in their group (such as the English Pointer), but conveys a clear sense of robustness thanks to its port square.

Care If kept in its natural environment of care that requests are rare, given its perfect adaptation to its environment. Like so many other breeds of hunting dogs require daily exercise and large doses of wide open spaces where they run. Temperament It is a gentle and quiet dog who is rarely easily startled. It is not a dog that fits well in urban environments. Training It is intelligent and learns easily it comes to their job hunting. Utility Like many other breeds of this group, this is a dog hunter, used in exclusive countryside environments, and has not been used in other purposes. Within this hunting breed is described as \\"trace and shows\\" (by its smell so). It is used for both hunting hair (rabbits, hares, etc.). and feather (birds). It is perfect for hunting in any terrain (hard as it is) because it has an enviable physical endurance and speed.

Objects which are referenced by that type are not seen to have any mutable state, and appear immutable.  Example  = Java = Consider a Java class which represents a two-dimensional point. public class Point2D { private int x; private int y; public Point2D(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; } public int getX() { return this.x; } public int getY() { return this.y; } public void setX(int newX) { this.x = newX; } public void setY(int newY) { this.y = newY; } } The class Point2D is mutable: its state can be changed after construction, by invoking either of the setter methods (\`setX()\` or \`setY()\`). An immutable interface for Point2D could be defined as: public interface ImmutablePoint2D { public int getX(); public int getY(); } By making Point2D implement ImmutablePoint2D, client code could now reference a type which does not have mutating methods, and thus appears immutable. This is demonstrated in the following example: ImmutablePoint2D point = new Point2D(0,0); // a concrete instance of Point2D is referenced by the immutable interface int x = point.getX(); // valid method call int y = point.setX(42); // compile error: the method setX() does not exist on type ImmutablePoint2D By referencing only the immutable interface, it is not valid to call a method which mutates the state of the concrete object. Advantages * Clearly communicates the immutable intent of the type. * Unlike types implementing the Immutable Wrapper pattern, does not need to \\"cancel out\\" mutating methods by issuing a \\"No Operation\\" instruction, or throwing a runtime exception when a mutating method is invoked. Disadvantages * It is possible for instances referenced by the immutable interface type to be cast to their concrete, mutable type, and have their state mutated. For example: public void mutate(ImmutablePoint2D point) { ((Point2D)point).setX(42); // this call is legal, since the type has // been converted to the mutable Point2D class } * Concrete classes have to explicitly declare they implement the immutable interface. This may not be possible if the concrete class \\"belongs to\\" third- party code, for instance, if it is contained within a library. * The object is not really immutable and hence not suitable for use in data structures relying on immutability like hash maps. And the object could be modified concurrently from the \\"mutable side\\". * Some compiler optimizations available for immutable objects might not be available for mutable objects.  Alternatives  An alternative to the immutable interface pattern is the immutable wrapper pattern. Persistent data structures are effectively immutable while allowing modified views of themselves.

The film was originally marketed as a straight-faced and serious product, and as such was comprehensively mauled by critics of the time. However it later gained a reputation as a cult film favourite due to its perceived shortcomings, absurdities and unintentional camp comedy appeal.  Plot  Lucy (Collins) is working as a dancer in a sleazy strip joint. Her stage act includes a routine with a dwarf named Hercules (George Claydon). One night after the show, she invites Hercules into her dressing-room for a drink. He declines the drink but starts to rub Lucy's neck and shoulders. Lucy feels uncomfortable but tries to pretend nothing is happening, until Hercules makes a sudden lunge for her breasts, causing her to scream out in shock. This alerts the stage manager Tommy (John Steiner), who rushes into the dressing-room and sends Hercules unceremoniously on his way, then proceeds to make love to Lucy. Later as Lucy leaves the club she is confronted by the spurned and humiliated Hercules, who curses her with the words \\"You will have a baby...a monster! An evil monster conceived inside your womb! As big as I am small and possessed by the devil himself!\\" Months pass and Lucy has left her stripping days behind, having moved up in the world via marriage to the wealthy Italian Gino Carlesi (Bates) and now comfortably settled in a grand Kensington townhouse. Lucy goes into hospital to give birth to the baby she is expecting. It proves to be a protracted, dangerous and painful delivery as the baby is a hefty 12-pounder. The newborn infant is handed to Lucy, and seconds later she is sporting a slashed and bleeding cheek. \\"He scratched me! With his sharp nails!\\" she exclaims in horror to her obstetrician Dr. Finch (Pleasence), who calmly explains that the baby must have been alarmed at being held too tightly. Lucy and Gino bring the baby home and are welcomed by their efficient, no-nonsense housekeeper Mrs. Hyde (Hilary Mason). Things get off to a bad start when Mrs. Hyde goes to chuck the baby's chin, only to regret it. \\"The little devil bit me!\\" she says as she displays her crushed finger. She takes an instant dislike to the child, and is later rewarded with a dead mouse in her cup of tea. Lucy's attempts at maternal bonding are fraught with problems. She is visited by her friend Mandy (Caroline Munro) and is voicing her concerns when they are interrupted by a series of crashings from upstairs. To their horror, they find the baby in his cot but the nursery practically demolished. Gino's sister Albana (Atkins), a nun, arrives from her convent in Italy to visit her new nephew. Immediately aware that all is not well, she invites Gino to pray with her for the baby, which results in agonising screams from the nursery. Dr. Finch is consulted, and agrees to carry out a series of tests. Lucy meanwhile finds the burdens of motherhood too much to bear alone, and employs a nurse (Janet Key) to look after the baby. After a near-miss when the nurse's head is pulled underwater while bathing the baby, matters take a deadly turn when she takes him for a walk in the park. Reaching out from his pram, he pushes her with such force that she falls, cracks her head on a lakeside rock, falls unconscious into the water and is drowned. Lucy pays a visit to Tommy at the strip club. She intimates that, given the timing of the birth, there is a chance the baby could be his. \\"Just ‚Äôcause you‚Äôve got some freaky offspring you wanna pin it on me?\\" he asks. However his curiosity is aroused and he asks to see the \\"spooky kid\\". Once at the house he leans over to peer into the baby's cot, only to reel back with a smashed and bloody nose for his trouble. This temporarily pushes the baby up in Lucy's estimation and she gazes lovingly at him, until the face in the cot turns into that of Hercules. One evening Gino plans a romantic night-in to take Lucy's mind off her woes. At the end of a successful evening, he goes to check on the baby, only to find the nursery empty, the window open and odd noises coming from the garden. Going out to investigate, he looks up into a tree, whereupon a noose is thrust around his neck and he is hauled into the air and hanged. His body is stuffed down a drain. The following day Lucy criss-crosses London in a frenzy trying to find her missing husband. Dr. Finch is summoned and pays an evening call to check on the baby and the distraught Lucy. After administering a powerful sedative to Lucy, he too hears strange noises. He unwisely steps out into the garden, and is decapitated with a spade (while still standing up). The trail of death continues as Lucy stumbles through the house in a groggy haze, pleading for her life to no avail as she is stabbed through the heart with a pair of scissors. Finally galvanized into action, Albana decides that she must perform an exorcism on the baby. Brandishing a crucifix at him and incanting in Latin, she bravely persists as the room shakes and the baby tears at her vestments. Meanwhile, at the strip club Hercules is on stage, and begins to stagger around in pain. Albana finally touches the crucifix to the baby's head, and his demons are cast out at the same time as Hercules falls over dead in front of a stunned audience.

A damning review by Andrew Nickolds of Time Out described the film as \\"derivative and disastrous in every respect: a poor idea ... an abominable screenplay by Stanley Price (\\"I keep getting these awful premonitions\\"), ludicrous acting ... and worst of all, Sasdy's direction. Almost every foot of film not concerned with the baby is travelogue at its most banal ‚Äì extraneous shots of Westminster and Oxford Street, plugs for Fortnum & Mason and Holiday Inns. Completing this sorry tale of rip-off is borrowing from The Exorcist ... and any number of details from Amicus, Hammer and Swinging London horrors. Give it a wide berth.\\"Time Out Film Guide, Penguin Books London, 1989, p.279 An American reviewer found the film \\"sensational and vulgar\\" and \\"an unholy cross\\" between The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, adding \\"why decent actors like Eileen Atkins and Donald Pleasence allowed themselves to be corralled into a mess like this is enigmatic.\\"\\"A rehash of forerunners\\" Bangor Daily News, 07-04-1976. Retrieved 02-10-2010 As The Devil Within Her, Roger Ebert named it as his \\"Dog of [March, 1976]\\", drawing the same comparisons to The Exorcist put forth by Nickolds, while adding \\"the kid must have been a sound effects man in a previous incarnation because he makes noises like squad car sirens and stones banging around at empty garbage cans. He's also good at murdering everybody in the family even the family doctor, who is played by Donald Pleasence as if he wanted to be somewhere else and for that matter . . . so did I.\\"http://siskelandebert.org/video/5839AGUA3RWX/Opening-Soon-at-a-Theater- Near-You-Taxi-Driverhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoteDt9dLx4 From the 1980s, the film became a regular feature on late-night TV in the UK and U.S., attracting ironic appreciation from connoisseurs of the \\"so-bad-it's-good\\" school of films. The factors which were originally ridiculed now became selling points to this audience, including the incoherent, implausible and ill-explained plot; wild overacting and a general air of absurd hysteria; laughably overwrought, clumsy and stilted dialogue, the bizarre accents adopted by Bates and Atkins; the inclusion of a lengthy, completely gratuitous and archetypally-1970s sex scene between Collins and Bates, and the spectacle of several well-respected actors of the time making fools of themselves. The tongue-in-cheek British Horror Films website sums up the film's appeal as: \\"There are some films that just defy description. I Don't Want to Be Born ranks very highly among them. The film is ... an out-and-out classic. And it was apparently made completely straight-faced. Quite how unbelievable that statement is can only be appreciated when the film is watched.\\"  References   External links   British films 1975 films 1975 horror films British horror films English- language films Films set in London Films shot at Pinewood Studios Films scored by Ron Grainer Films directed by Peter Sasdy ","title":"I Don't Want to Be Born"},{"id":"29046886","text":"The 1986‚Äì87 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team represented Princeton University in intercollegiate college basketball during the 1986‚Äì87 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Merrie Melodies animated cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on March 6, 1943. The cartoon features a band of mice who engage in war against a cat. Synopsis The short film begins with a pleasant group of brown mice who are - to the tune of ‚ÄúAin't We Got Fun?\\" - enjoying various water sports and other fun activities in and around a kitchen sink. Lurking just outside the house is a sinister cat; after he gets inside he gains the confidence of a dim-witted grey mouse who has already underestimated the predator. The cat persuades the easily manipulated rodent - via a promise of cheese, \\"all you want\\" - to impress upon the brown mice that he, the cat, is there to save them when, in actuality, he will enslave them. The grey mouse follows the cat's orders and convinces his compatriots to appease. The brown mice indeed become slaves to the cat, fulfilling his every desire. Finally, he openly states that he wants to eat \\"a nice, fat, tender mouse\\". The brown mice flee; the grey mouse runs to join them when the cat turns his appetite toward him. The newly formed brown mouse united alliance prepares for war, constructing a 'secret weapon' to even the upcoming battle: a mechanical bulldog. The ensuing chase forces the cat from the house after being shaved nearly bald. As the brown mice celebrate the victory, the grey mouse tries to claim partial credit (quoting Red Skelton‚Äôs famous line \\"I Dood it\\"); in response, he is immediately pied. References to World War II The cat is treated as the enemy and symbolizes the Axis. After the cat whispers his plan inside the dim-witted mouse's ear the cat's face briefly mimics that of a stereotypically caricatured Japanese, while Japanese sounding music is briefly heard. When the mouse agrees to fulfill the plan, he gives the cat a Nazi salute. The grey mouse represents the policy of appeasement, and the overall theme of the short is that the policy does not work against the Axis and will lead to ruin. When the cat's fur is shaved off, the first four notes of Ludwig van Beethoven‚Äôs ‚ÄúFifth Symphony‚Äù are played; these notes were used by the Allied Forces as a symbol for \\"V\\" (for \\"victory\\") in Morse code; also, when shaved four tufts of hair are left on the cat's back - three short and one long tuft - equivalent to the Morse Code dit-dit-dit-dah - which is the letter \\"V\\". Near the end of the cartoon, the brown mice sing ‚ÄúWe did it before and We can do it again‚Äù, a patriotic chant that was often used in American propaganda movies during World War II. The song was co- written in 1941 by Tin Pan Alley songwriter Charles Tobias (who also co-wrote the Merrie Melodies theme some years earlier) as a response to the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.

The main entrance, centered on the facade, is recessed in a paneled archway, topped by a semi-elliptical fanlight and framed by very thin columns and leaded sidelight windows. The building has a richly decorated entablature, and its roof perimeter has a low balustrade, interrupted by brick piers. The building was built for Joseph Ensign, a local businessman, in 1917 to a design by the Hartford architectural firm of Smith & Bassette. In addition to housing the Simsbury Bank and Trust Company (founded 1916), it also housed local telephone company offices for many years, as well as a variety of retail tenants.

The book was primarily about heroes found in the Bible as well as some more secular pieces. Her second work was published in 1860 and was entitled Lays of the Reformation, and other Lyrics, scriptural and Miscellaneous. Crewdson died on 15 September 1863 after a period of illness at her home in Whalley Range, Manchester. A further selection of her poetry pieces were collected and published under the title of A Little While and other Poems (Manchester, 1864, 12mo).

The Nyas was formed by members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council).

However, the Babri Mosque stood on the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, was constructed by Mughal emperor Babur after he demolished the original Rama temple on the site. The issue was taken up by organisations such as the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major Hindu nationalist political party. In 1992, a procession led by the VHP near the mosque ended up demolishing the mosque, which caused major communal violence across India between Hindus and Muslims.Tearing down the Babri Masjid - Eye Witness BBC's Mark Tully BBC - Thursday, 5 December 2002, 19:05 GMTBabri Masjid demolition was planned 10 months in advance - PTI The Ayodhya dispute. BBC News. 15 November 2004. Foundation The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (RJN) was founded as an independent trust by members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad on 25 January 1993 to take charge of the site of Ram Janmabhoomi and oversee the construction of the proposed Rama temple. Ramchandra Das Paramhans (1913‚Äì2003) was head of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, succeeded upon his death by Nritya Gopal Das. Its members argued that the Nyas was created so that the Government of India would not control the site and end up involving itself in the construction of the temple. The RJN also operates workshops in Karsevakpuram (City of Volunteers), a major encampment of volunteer activists (called Karsevaks) outside Ayodhya preparing to undertake the construction of the temple. 2010 Ayodhya verdict The leaders of the RJN welcomed the decision of the Allahabad High Court to distribute the disputed territory into three parts, with one-third going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and another to the Nirmohi Akhara Hindu denomination. However, the RJN claimed that it was the rightful party to take possession of the land and said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of India to seek possession of the entire site. 2019 Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya dispute The final hearing in the Supreme Court ended on 16 October 2019. The bench reserved the final judgment and granted three days to contesting parties to file written notes on 'moulding of relief' or narrowing down the issues on which the court is required to adjudicate. The final judgement in the Supreme Court was officially declared on 9 November 2019. The Supreme Court dismisses the claim of Sunni Waqf Board and ordered that a trust to be made by the Government of India which be building the Temple.

The campaign began with raiding Ferryland on November 10, 1696 and continued along the coast until they raided the village of Heart's Content (See Map of the Campaign's raids and battles.) After the Siege of Pemaquid (1696), d'Iberville along with Father Jean BaudoinAlan F. Williams, Father Baudoin's War: D'Iberville's Campaigns in Acadia and Newfoundland 1696, 1697, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1987 led a force of Canadians, Acadians, Mi'kmaq and Abenakis in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. They destroyed almost every English settlement in Newfoundland, over 100 English were killed, many times that number captured, and almost 500 deported to England or France.  Historical context  During this time period, the only French settlement on Newfoundland was Plaisance. Prior to the arrival of d'Iberville, Newfoundland's French Governor de Brouillon ordered a French naval squadron under Chevalier Nesmond to lay siege to St. John's in retaliation for earlier English attacks. In 1694, Nesmond set sail from Plaisance to lay siege St. John's. This siege was unsuccessful. Two years later, however, the French made a second attempt. On September 12, 1696, Quebec's Governor Frontenac sent Pierre Le Moyne Sieur d'Iberville to Newfoundland. The previous August, d'Iberville had just been victorious in the Siege of Pemaquid, on the coast of present-day Maine.  The campaign  The Newfoundland campaign involved a novel strategy: both a land and sea assault of the villages. D'Iberville attacked by land while Sieur de Brouillan attacked by sea. D'Iberville's strategy of attacking the settlement by land was the first recorded in Newfoundland and, as a result, the port villages were only prepared for an assault by sea. D'Iberville left Placentia on All Saints' Day (November 1) with his detachment of 124 men; soldiers, Acadians, and Indians. It was an , nine-day march across the Avalon Peninsula. = Siege of Ferryland = On the morning of November 9th, the residents of Ferryland awoke to see a small fleet of French ships on the horizon. When within range, the French began a bombardment of the settlement. Sieur de Brouillan had begun the Siege of Ferryland. D'Iberville arrived on November 10, and the troops sacked Ferryland. Meanwhile, the 110 people of Ferryland fled to Bay Bulls and set about fortifying it. = Raid on Cape Broyle = D'Iberville set out against Bay Bulls using the small boats he had taken in Ferryland. On his way Cape Broyle was captured on November 12. = Raid on Bay Bulls = He then captured Bay Bulls on November 24, including a 100-ton merchant ship. = Raid on Petty Harbour = On November 24, after a three-hour march from Bay Bulls, d'Iberville met up with his group of 20 scouts who had been sent to study the approaches to St. John's. Two days later, he encountered a detachment of 30 English soldiers posted on a hilltop near Petty Harbour. On November 26, d'Iberville charged and the enemy surrendered immediately. D'Iberville and his men were in command of the small port just eight kilometres south of St. John's. However, some colonists from Petty Harbour escaped to St. John's, where they alerted its residents. = Siege of St. John's = As d'Iberville marched into St. John's from Petty Harbour, English residents marched out the Waterford Valley to meet and repel the French. A pitched battle occurred in the Waterford Valley (Burnt Wood) and on the Heights of Kilbride (November 28). Of the 88 English defenders, 34 died in the battle. The English broke ranks and hastily retreated to St. John's. As d'Iberville approached St. John's, the English settlers scattered. Many sailed away, others escaped to the forests. A number of settlers and soldiers took refuge in Fort William. For three days the French laid siege to Fort William. On November 30, the English commander, Governor Miners, surrendered on condition that the English be allowed to leave St. John's. 230 men, women and children were sent off in a ship and duly arrived in Dartmouth, England. However a further 80 refugees were drowned when their ship foundered off the coast of Spain. After destroying St. John's, the French marched on Torbay (December 2), and Portugal Cove (December 5 and January 13). Internal struggles between de Brouillan and d'Iberville over the spoils of war followed. On December 25 de Brouillan left for Plaisance. The French burnt 80 shallops in the harbour (January 2). = Raid on Conception Bay = The villages on Conception Bay were the next targets. Holyrood (January 19) was first followed by Harbour Main (January 20) and Port de Grave (January 23). = Battle of Carbonear = On January 24, 1697, two hundred permanent residents of Carbonear withdrew to Carbonear Island and successfully fended off the French and Indian attack on January 31. D'Iberville had only 70 men, the rest were dispersed in local skirmishes, holding villages and prisoners. Leaving Carbonear d'Iberville then attacked Old Perlican (February 4), Bay de Verde (February 6), Hants Harbour (February 7), New Perlican and Hearts Content (February 9). In many cases the local fishermen had fled to Carbonear. There was an unsuccessful attempt at a prisoner exchange (February 18). Frustrated, d'Iberville then sacked Brigus (February 11) and Port de Grave (February 11). Carbonear Island continued to hold out but d'Iberville torched their evacuated settlement on February 28 before leaving. D'Iberville then headed to Heart's Content before walking in a small group across the Avalon Peninsula isthmus. He arrived March 4 at Plaisance. D'Iberville then picked up his spoils of war, his scattered troops and approximately 200 prisoners at Bay Boulle (March 18-May 18). French attacks by sea on the remnants of the settlements continued into the spring (March 27-April 19).  Aftermath  D'Iberville never returned to Newfoundland. These raids devastated the English settlements of Newfoundland. Every English settlement in Newfoundland had been destroyed and the English colony had been depopulated, except for Bonavista, which D'Iberville did not reach and the island holdout at Carbonear.Reid, John G. \\"1686-1720 Imperial Intrusions\\" In Phillip Buckner and John Reid (eds.) The Atlantic Region to Confederation: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1994. p. 84 Estimates of eighty percent of the families were killed, deserted the village, were taken prisoner or were deported.The census indicate there was about an eighty percent turnover in the family names of settlers on a census from c. 1680 - 1713. By Father Baudion's account, the French killed between 104 and 200 individuals ‚Äì approximately 8% of the population. However the English were able to recapture their Newfoundland territory in summer of 1697 with a strong relief force of 1500 troops. They found St. John's and all the English harbours on the Avalon abandoned, pillaged and every building destroyed. The English slowly began to rebuild and resettle. As a result of the campaign, the English government created permanent defences for Newfoundland. Previously the English had not built permanent fortifications or garrisons in Newfoundland as it was regarded as a seasonal fishing base. However d'Iberville's devastating campaign had demonstrated the threat to the poorly defended colony. The following year construction began on professionally engineered fortifications at Fort William.Reid, p. 84-85 D'Iberville continued his battles with the English, with the Battle of Hudson's Bay.

One of the most prevalent practices in the United States is product fundraising. Schools and other non-profits raise $1.7 billion each year by selling popular consumer items.Association of Fund-Raising Distributors and Suppliers (AFRDS) Eight out of 10 Americans support these types of programs.Association of Fund-Raising Distributors and Suppliers (AFRDS) In addition, schools and school groups such as their Parent Teacher Organization and Parent Teacher Association find many creative ways to raise funds‚Äîfrom bake sales, dinner events, auctions and school carnivals to more aggressive advertising, affinity programs, grant writing and straight forward donation requests.  Product fundraisers  Product fundraising has its origins in the early 20th century. The practice typically involves the purchase and re-sale of popular consumer products by a non-profit group whereupon the group sponsoring the sale keeps a portion of the gross sales. Products can be purchased in bulk and paid for in advance by the organization, then re-sold to supporters. Products may also be ordered using a catalog, order forms and other methods. Supporters pay for the product when the order is placed or upon final delivery. Under some product fundraising models, the school or non-profit organization is required to pay for a fixed number of products in advance. There are three types of product fundraisers that schools use to generate revenue. (1) Pre-sales Fundraising, (2) Product In-Hand Fundraising, (3) Online Fundraising, with online fundraising rising in popularity over the course of the past decade. As of 2010, there are over a thousand fundraising companies in the United States offering their products and services to schools and their associated nonprofit parent teacher groups.Fundraising Companies Directory In the past year, many changes have occurred in the school fundraising industry. A few online fundraising companies, like Piggybackr, are now using social media web apps, such as Facebook and Twitter, to make online fundraising easier for schools and the parents and students who promote them. Additionally, Fundraising Software is also now available allowing a school to have their own platform that makes it easy to engage students, parents, faculty, donors, and alumni with compelling communication campaigns. Self-organized school fundraisers  Other school fundraisers that generate substantial revenue for schools include auctions and raffles. With these types of fundraising activities, the school requests donations from local restaurants and businesses in their area, that are then offered at the event. In the case of an auction, people are allowed to bid on the dinner, limousine ride, or whatever was donated by the local businesses in the community. In the case of a raffle, people purchase raffle tickets that are then later picked randomly from a container. Often the donations are solicited by parents acting on behalf of the school, who make phone calls, write letters, or know of other parents who work for companies who may be willing to donate.Fundraising Ideas & Products Center - Do It Yourself Fundraising Scrip fundraising Scrip fundraising offers an alternative to fundraisers that rely on selling products or raffle tickets. The scrip fundraising concept was pioneered by St. Vincent DePaul Parish in Petaluma CA in 1988, and quickly grew to a powerful fundraising method for schools across the US.Santa Rosa Press Democrat, \\"Following the Scrip: How an SR-Based Group Revolutionized the Hottest Method of School Fundraising\\" With scrip fundraising, retailers offer gift cards (‚Äúscrip‚Äù, or ‚Äúsubstitute money‚Äù) at a discount to non-profit organizations. The non-profit organizations then sell the gift cards to member families at full face value. The families redeem the gift cards at full face value, and the discount or rebate is retained by the non-profit organization as revenue.PTO Today, \\"Managing Your Scrip Program\\" ShopWithScrip reports that more than 50,000 non-profit organizations have raised more than $800 million with scrip fundraising.ShopWithScrip: About our Company Scrip fundraising differs from other school fundraising programs because there is no selling. Families do their normal household shopping at scrip retailers with scrip gift cards. A family that regularly does their shopping with scrip gift cards can easily raise $500 to $1000 or more per year. Participating schools use these funds for field trips, scholarships, tuition assistance or fee reductions. One persistent and basic question has been whether or not any portion of the funds that are raised through a scrip program and applied to a family‚Äôs tuition account should be considered taxable income to the parent who purchases the scrip. According to ShopWithScrip, scrip is a reduction in purchase price from the face value, and is in effect a rebate from the retailer, and as such is not considered gross income.Overview of Scrip Tax Issues, Private Letter Ruling-118535-09 -\\"Are there scrip tax implications for my non-profit organization?\\" Economic pressures  Some parents and schools are now having to resort to extensive fundraising, including in one case having to raise $300,000 in six months to close budget gaps in order to keep Cordova Lane Elementary School in Sacramento, California open.Sacramento Bee, Oct 3, 2010 Additionally, general economic hardships can cause school fundraisers to earn less, as volunteer time is spread thin with more families requiring dual incomes. A survey done by national fundraising association in 2007 determined that on average the most labor-intensive school wide fundraisers, in terms of the number of volunteers needed is school carnivals, with an average of 59 volunteers needed. Other labor-intensive fundraisers included: auctions (28), \\"thons\\" such as walk-a-thons (22), breakfasts or dinners (17) and raffles (17). By contrast the least labor- intensive fundraisers for schools included: product fundraisers (7), direct donations (7), restaurant nights (6) and student portraits (2).Fundraising Newsletter Another survey from the same source showed 71% of parents are \\"concerned and overwhelmed\\" with having to do more fundraisers.AFRDS  History  Door-to-door fundraising and in hand product fundraising sales (out side local stores) has been a regular part of societal activities since the early 1970s. However, door-to-door sales came under scrutiny in 1997 following the murder of an 11-year-old New Jersey boy who was killed while fundraising unsupervised in his neighborhood. Due to this fundraisers do not allow kids to go door to door.New York Times, Dec 9, 1997 Today, most product sales are made to parents, family members, co-workers, friends and close neighbors. The fundraising industry strongly discourages unsupervised door-to-door sales.AFRDS See also * School bus advertising  References  Education finance Schools ","title":"School fundraising"},{"id":"29047887","text":"The Andalusian Hound () is a dog breed originating in Spain, especially Andalusia. These dogs are similar to other Iberian breeds such as the Ibizan Hound, the Portuguese Podengo, the Podenco Canario and the Maneto. Standardization and recognition Despite being a native ancient breed, it was not until 1990 that it entered the world of official cynology with the formation of a breed club to promote the development of breed standards. Phillipe Bloque-Rent√≥n and colleagues at the University of C√≥rdoba's veterinary medicine faculty undertook the research work required to specify the breed; their study, presented at the second Simposium de las razas caninas espa√±olas (Spanish dog breeds symposium) in 1992, was recognized by Real Sociedad Canina de Espa√±a (Royal Spanish Dog Society, RSCE) in April of that year as a defining breed standard. In Spain, Andalusian hounds were included within Group V - Spitz and Primitive Types, under Section 7, Primitive type - Hunting dogs. However, the breed is recognized neither by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) nor by any other international dog breeds association, due to the large number of matches with the Portuguese Podengo standard ‚Äî a fact which casts doubt on its claim to be regarded as a separate breed. In January 2015, the Andalusian Hound was nationally recognized in Germany.Der VDH erkennt vier neue Rassen national an. VDH. Varieties Andalusian hound (front-side) As in the Portuguese Podengo, the Andalusian Hound comes in three sizes (large, medium and small) and with three types of coat (wire-haired, long-haired and smooth). This combination of factors can results in nine different varieties. There is also a dwarf or basset variety derived from a medium-sized short-haired Andalusian Hound ‚Äî called Maneto from its short, stout legs ‚Äî which the RSCE has provisionally accepted as a distinct breed. Breed features Andalusian Podencos, like other hounds, have excellent sight, hearing and smell, which makes them good hunters, often employed for hunting rabbits. Andalusians and mastiffs form the heart of the rehalas (teams of 20 to 24 hunting dogs) of central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula; medium and smaller dogs search out deer or wild boar, whilst the larger hounds are used for attacking the prey. One of the most typical functions of the large Andalusian hound was that of the so-called quitaorQuitaor is the dialectal Andalusian word corresponding to the Castilian Spanish quitador. Hunting dogs with this role were trained not to eat or tear apart their prey. accompanying the Spanish greyhound collerasAccording to the authoritative Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola, in Andalusian Spanish the word collera is defined as Pareja de ciertos animales, as in Una collera de pavos (\\"a certain pair of animals, such as a pair of turkeys\\"). In hunting, the partners do not have to be a male and a female, although the meaning of collera is usually that of a mated pair. during hare hunting. The quitaor‚Äòs job consisted primarily of flushing out the hares from their home or hiding place and killing them; then, together with the greyhounds, retrieving them for the owner. In Andalusian farmhouses the larger hounds were used as watchdogs, and the smaller hounds were used to kill rodents.

An important Arb√´resh publisher of Albanian folklore was the linguist Demetrio Camarda, who included in his 1866 Appendice al Saggio di grammatologia comparata (Appendix to the Essay on the Comparative Grammar) a great number of Albanian songs from Sicily and Calabria, some folk poems from Albania proper and a few from Albanian settlements in Greece. In this collection there are some Arb√´resh epic songs. Arb√´resh writer Girolamo De Rada, who was already imbued with a passion for his Albanian lineage in the first half of the 19th century, began collecting folklore material at an early age. De Rada published in 1866 the collection Rapsodie di un poema albanese (Rhapsodies of an Albanian Poem), which consists of 72 epic poems from the colonies of Napolitano, with also the Italian translation. The rhapsodies are divided into three parts: \\"Gli Albanesi allo stato libero\\" with 20 songs; \\"Gli Albanesi in guerra col Turco\\" with 20 songs; \\"Gli Albanesi vinti ed in esilio\\" with 32 songs. However, there is some doubt about the complete originality of this collection, since he himself admitted to have made a few changes in it. An important collection of Albanian epic poems was published by Michele Marchian√≤ in Canti popolari albanesi delle colonie d'Italia in 1908. The poems of this collections maintain exactly the original form as they were found in a 1737 manuscript. In 1911 and 1912 he also published Canti popolari albanesi della Capitanata e del Molise in Rivista d'Apulia. In 1923 Giuseppe Schir√≤ published the remarkable collection Canti tradizionali ed altri saggi delle colonie albanesi di Sicilia. Greece There are not much material of Albanian songs recorded in Greece. The first collector was the German physician Karl H. Reinhold who recorded Albanian folk poems from the Greco- Albanian sailors from the islands of Poros and Hydra while he was serving as a doctor in the Greek navy. He published his collection in Noctes Pelasgicae (Pelasgic Nights, with the term \\"Pelasgic\\" meaning Albanian) in 1855. K. D. Sotiriou published in 1909 the collection \\"Short Songs and Tales of the Albanians\\" written in the Arvanitika dialect of the village of Markopulo in Attica and the island of Spetses. =Albania= During the 19th century many foreign scholars took interest in Albanian folklore. The first writer to mention Albanian heroic songs was Lord Byron in his Child Harold at the beginning of the 19th century. Stimulated by the collections of the Arb√´resh√´ writers and foreigners, the interest of native Albanians in collecting Albanian oral creations grow with the Albanian National Awakening (Rilindja) in the second half of the 19th century. The first Albanian collector of oral epic songs from Albania proper was Zef Jubani. From 1848 he served as interpreter to French consul in Shkodra, Louis Hyacinthe H√©cquard, who was very interested in folklore and decided to prepare a book on northern Albanian oral tradition. They travelled through the northern Albanian mountains and recorded folklore material which were published in French translation in the 1858 H√©cquard's pioneering Histoire et description de la Haute Albanie ou Gu√©garie (History and Description of High Albania or Gegaria‚Äù). This collection contains twelve songs in French, without the original Albanian, which were lost later in the flood that devastated the city of Shkodra on 13 January 1866. Jubani published in 1871 the original Albanian songs with Italian translation in the collection Raccolta di canti popolari e rapsodie di poemi albanesi (Collection of Albanian Folk Songs and Rhapsodies), which constitutes the first collection of Geg folk songs and the first folkloristik work to be published by an Albanian who lived in Albania. This collection contains also a number of poems sung in Shkodra. One of the best collections of Albanian oral tradition is Alvaniki melissa ‚Äì Belietta Sskiypetare (The Albanian Bee) published in Alexandria by Thimi Mitko in the year 1878. Mitko compiled and classified the material according to genres. The most important part of this collection are the lyric poems. It contains 123 heroic songs, 97 in the Tosk dialect and 26 in the Gheg dialect of Albanian. They celebrate the battles of the Albanians in the different parts of the Ottoman Empire, including the heroic deeds of beys and those of the Souliotes. Franciscan priests and scholars active in the northern Albanian mountains recorded Northern Albanian epic songs in the early decades of the 20th century by. Among the most important Albanian folklorists were Shtjef√´n Gje√ßovi, Bernardin Palaj and Donat Kurti, who collected folk songs on their travels through the mountains and wrote articles on Gheg Albanian folklore and tribal customs. Palaj and Kurti published in 1937‚Äîon the 25th anniversary of Albanian independence‚Äîthe most important collection of Albanian epic verse, K√¢ng√´ kreshnik√´sh dhe legenda (The Songs of the Frontier Warriors and Legends), in the series called Visaret e Kombit (The Treasures of the Nation). =Kosovo and Sand≈æak= In 1830 Vuk Karad≈æiƒá recorded from Dovica Obadoviƒá from ƒêurakovac near Peƒá 12 Albanian songs and one riddle for Jernej Kopitar. This collection constitutes one of the earliest written records of Albanian oral verse from Kosovo. The complete collection was first published by Norbert Jokl. The extracts of songs of this collection seems to be based on historical or legendary events.. The collection contains heroic and lyric songs, including also laments. Accompanying instruments The Northern Albanian epic poetry is performed singing to the accompaniment of the lahut√´ or √ßifteli. Lahuta is a one-stringed musical instrument with a long neck and oval shaped body. It consists of a sound box made of carved wood (usually maple as it is considered as the best material) covered with an animal skin, and a long neck which is decorated at the top, usually with the head of a goat, a ram or a horse. The string of the Lahuta is made of horsehair. The instrument is held vertically between the knees, with the left hand fingers on the neck. It is played with a bow pulled over the string which is never pressed to the neck, creating a dramatic and sharp sound, expressive and difficult to master. In singing, the voice follows the harmonic and unique sound produced by the instrument. √áiftelia is a plucked two-stringed musical instrument with a long neck and oval shaped body. It is most often tuned to B3 and E3 (comparable to the top two strings of a guitar, which is classically tuned as \\"E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4\\"). One string carries the melody, the other is usually played as a drone. National epic poem The Albanian national epic poem The Highland Lute () was written by Albanian Catholic friar Gjergj Fishta and published in 1937. It consists of 30 songs and over 17,000 verses. The poem has been inspired by northern Albanian oral epic poetry.

Plot As described in a film magazine, raised aboard a ship, Jacques Leroi (Barrymore) has never seen a woman until after the death of his father, a man who had been disappointed in love. As the only heir, the will stipulates that he is to remain on board until he reaches 25 years of age. On his 25th birthday, he arrives in New York City to consult his lawyer, and meets the gold-digging Madge Vance (Nilsson), who is being courted by John Carson (Sherry). While off the coast of Florida on his yacht with Miss Vance, Jacques has the captain marry them and they go on a long cruise. Upon returning to New York City Jacques discovers that, according to the will, he will not inherit anything until he is 30 years old if he marries in haste. Madge then leaves him. Jacques becomes despondent, and agrees to attempt to cross the Pacific Ocean in a dirigible balloon with the patentee of a new form of gas. The blimp fails to rise above the air currents and he is forced to land on a small island. There he comes upon the strange occupants of the island, people who have been saved from various shipwrecks. They all wear Greek style clothing, eat at restaurants free of charge, and no one works. He falls in love with the native girl Mavis (Moore), but confesses that he has a wife and must return to the United States. The islanders loan him a boat, and he soon returns to New York City, where he discovers that Madge has become engaged to John Carson.

It is the site from which Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) initiated trans-Pacific airmail service on November 22, 1935. A flying boat named China Clipper made the first trip, and the publicity for that flight caused all flying boats on that air route to become popularly known as China Clippers. For a few years, this pioneering mail service captured the public imagination like the earlier Pony Express, and offered fast luxury travel like the later Concorde. Location In 1927, wetlands on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay were filled to form an airport with an east/west runway, three hangars, an administration building, and a yacht harbor. By 1930, United States Army Air Corps operations referred to the site as Benton Field. Pan Am used the yacht harbor as their California terminal for trans- Pacific flights beginning in 1935. On 1 June 1936, the city of Alameda, California gave the airport to the United States government a few months before the Army discontinued operations from the field. Congressional appropriations for construction passed in 1938 and allowed naval air station operations to begin on 1 November 1940. Pan Am shifted their terminal to Treasure Island for the duration of the Golden Gate International Exposition in anticipation the island would become San Francisco's airport following the exposition. The United States Navy took over Treasure Island when the exposition ended, and San Francisco municipal airport was built at Mills Field; so the Pan Am flying boat Clippers used Navy terminal facilities for the remainder of their service lives. The site is now part of the Alameda Naval Air Station. Peacetime The initial flight carried only air mail, but passenger service began in October 1936, with three Martin M-130 flying boats named Hawaii Clipper (NC14714), Philippine Clipper (NC14715), and China Clipper (NC14716). The route from San Francisco Bay, via Pearl Harbor, Midway Atoll, Wake Island, and Guam to Manila Bay required six days with approximately sixty hours of flying time at a cruising speed of 130 miles per hour. Each flying boat offered spacious accommodation for approximately a dozen passengers and typically carried two crews, with the second crew being trained by the first in oceanic navigation and flight procedures. One-way fare was approximately $700.Kla√°s, M.D. \\"Clipper Across the Pacific, Part One.\\" Air Classics, Volume 25, No. 12, December 1989. p.20 Boeing 314 on Manila Bay in 1940.

Hawaii Clipper disappeared westbound from Guam to Manila in July, 1938.Aviation Safety Network 10 October 2006, URL retrieved 3 October 2010 There were unsubstantiated rumors of Japanese involvement, similar to those arising from the disappearance of Amelia Earhart a year earlier. Earhart's navigator, Fred Noonan, had been navigator aboard China Clipper during the initial airmail flight. Boeing 314 flying boats Honolulu Clipper (NC18601) and California Clipper (NC18602) joined the surviving Martin M-130s in 1939, and Pacific Clipper (NC18609) and Anzac Clipper (NC18611) extended service to New Zealand and Australia in 1941. Wartime Philippine Clipper returned to Wake when it received news of the attack on Pearl Harbor and was strafed floating on the lagoon when Japanese planes attacked Wake. Despite 96 bullet holes, the Clipper successfully returned to California. Pacific Clipper was in Auckland, New Zealand at the time of the attack, and its crew opted to return to the United States westbound rather than retrace its normal route. Its January 1942 arrival in New York marked the first circumnavigation of the globe by commercial aircraft.Dover, Ed. The Long Way Home. McLean, Virginia: Paladwr Press, 1999. . The United States Navy assumed control of the Clippers in 1942, although Pan Am crews continued to fly the aircraft. Clippers flew between California and Hawaii and to Australia via Canton Island, Fiji, Noum√©a, and New Zealand while the Western Pacific was controlled by Japan. Clippers would sometimes divert to Clear Lake Outlying Field when weather was unsuitable for landing on San Francisco Bay. Philippine Clipper crashed southwest of Ukiah, California, while carrying Pacific Fleet Submarine Force commander Robert English and his senior staff from Pearl Harbor to San Francisco during a January 1943 storm. It took search crews more than a week to locate the aircraft crash site on a mountain near Boonville, California. China Clipper, last of the three Martin M-130s, crashed in Trinidad in January 1945.Aviation Safety Network October 23, 2006, URL retrieved on October 3, 2010 Honolulu Clipper, the first of twelve Boeing 314s built, was still flying for the Navy in November 1945 when it successfully landed 650 miles east of Oahu after losing power in two engines. Aircraft mechanics from the escort carrier Manila Bay were unable to repair the engines at sea. The seaplane tender San Pablo attempted to tow the flying boat into port; but Honolulu Clipper was damaged in a collision with the tender and intentionally sunk by perforating the hull with 1200 20mm Oerlikon shells after salvage was deemed impractical. End of service Surviving Clippers returned to civilian ownership after the war, but the era of the long-range commercial flying boat had passed. Large runways had been constructed around the world for heavy bombers, and military bomber technology was rapidly adapted for commercial airline service without the dangers and inconvenience of water landings.

He fought five world champions in the WWI boxing era, defeating or giving close bouts to each. He was managed in his early career by Billy Walsh, and for a time by Blacky Raggio.Five world champions in \\"Fighter's Body Pulled From Bay\\", Daily World, Opelousas, Louisiana, pg. 27, 1 August 1956Managed by Blacky Raggio in \\"Joe Mandot Wins: Referee Saves Allen\\", The Times-Democrat, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 10, 9 January 1912 Early life and career He was born on August 3, 1889 in New Orleans, and worked for a period as a baker prior to his boxing career. His father owned a bakery in the New Orleans' French quarter, and his brother worked as a baker as well.Father owned a bakery in \\"Wolgast-Mandot Fight Provided Endless\\", Star Tribune, Minneapolis, Minnesota, pg. 20, 27 December 1936 Turning professional around April 1909, in September of that year, he competed for the Southern Bantamweight title in Atlanta, Georgia, drawing with George Kitson in a ten round decision. Future world lightweight champion Charley White fell to Mandot in an eight round points decision at Memphis's Southern Athletic Club on April 17, 1911. Mandot knocked White to the canvas in both the second and seventh rounds. White appeared too battered to finish in the seventh, but fought gamely on, taking the lead in the fighting in the eighth.\\"Charley White Loses To Mandot\\", Quad-City Times, Davenport, Iowa, pg. 8, 18 April 1911 Mandot defeated former Canadian lightweight champion Billy Allen on January 18, 1912 decisively in an eight round points decision in Memphis. Allen was floored seven times, and was badly punished in the fifth, sixth, and seventh rounds, dispensing staggering swings to the head and body.\\"Joe Mandot Wins: Referee Saves Allen\\", The Times-Democrat, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 10, 9 January 1912 Mandot defeated Philadelphia Pal Moore on February 20, 1912 in a ten round points decision in New Orleans. It was the consensus of most sports writers that Mandot had clearly won five rounds, with Moore three, and two even. It was in the tenth that Mandot assured his victory with telling blows to the face of Moore. Mandot marked the Philadelphia boxer's face and nearly closed his left eye. Moore still fought aggressively, particularly in the seventh and eighth, and carried the fighting in the first six rounds as well. In the opinion of one reporter, Mandot landed more blows in all but the first, second, and possibly eighth rounds, but the bout was close, and particularly fierce in the final round. He scored more often in the infighting and landed frequently to Mandot's midsection.\\"Joe Mandot Awarded Decision Over Moore\\", The Times-Democrat, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 11, 21 February 1912 Mandot won an eight round points decision with Owen Moran on April 1, 1912. Mandot was down for a long count in the second, but carried the fight to the Englishman for the remainder of the match, scoring a comfortable lead in points by the eighth.\\"Joe Mandot Gives Owen Moran A Bad Beating\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 29, 2 April 1912 Mandot forced the fight after the second round with little or no counterpunching from Moran.\\"Joe Mandot Gives Owen Moran a Bad Beating\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 29, 2 April 1912 On June 24, 1912, Mandot drew with future holder of the world lightweight championship, Willie Ritchie, in a ten round newspaper decision in New Orleans. In a close bout, The Washington Post wrote that Ritchie was close to knocking out Mandot in the tenth round.\\"Mandot Given Big Surprise\\", The Washington Post, Washington, D.C., pg. 8, 26 June 1912 New Orleans' Times Democrat wrote that Ritchie had the lead in the last three rounds, and since Mandot was down twice in the tenth, Ritchie deserved the decision.\\"Ritchie Earns Decision Over Mandot at Orleans\\", The Times-Democrat, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 11, 25 June 1912 The New Orleans Daily Picayune, however wrote that Mandot had a solid lead going into the ninth, and that Ritchie's performance in the tenth merited only a draw, though the referee, who was satisfied with the draw ruling, believed Mandot still held a slight lead after the tenth. Mandot defeated Mexican Joe Rivers on September 2, 1912 in a twenty round points decision at the Arena in Vernon, California. The New York Daily wrote that Mandot had the better of all but three rounds and won the decision by a wide margin. He penetrated Rivers's defense, landing straight lefts almost continuously. In the eighth, he began rocking Rivers' head with right and left swings, and in the remaining rounds he followed this attack. Rivers appeared to have won the fourth, sixth, and eleventh by a slight margin.\\"Mandot Gets Decision Over Mexican Joe Rivers\\", The York Daily, York, Pennsylvania, pg. 3, 3 September 1912 Rivers contended unsuccessfully for the American version of the world lightweight title in 1913. He would lose to Rivers on November 28, 1912 in a twenty round points decision at the Arena in Vernon. The fighting was fast and fierce, but Rivers appeared to win decisively, landed more frequent and telling blows and taking the lead in most of the rounds.\\"Mexican Fighter The Better Man in Tame Bout\\", The San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg. 10, 29 November 1912 =Contending for the world lightweight title= Ad Wolgast He contended for the world lightweight title against Ad Wolgast on November 4, 1912, drawing in a ten round newspaper decision in New Orleans. Had Mandot won by knockout or technical knockout, he would have taken the title from Wolgast. Leach Cross defeated Mandot on March 10, 1913 in a tenth round technical knockout in New Orleans. Cross was an exceptionally skilled New York based Jewish boxer. Mandot performed well in the first eight rounds, flooring Cross for no-counts in the fourth and fifth rounds. But Cross floored Mandot in the ninth with a crushing right and sent him to the canvas four more times, for the most part using rights to the jaw. In the tenth, after he was knocked down twice, Mandot's handlers threw in the towel only 15 seconds after the opening bell.\\"Cross Stops Mandot in the Final Round\\", The Times-Democrat, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 7, 11 March 1913 Mandot lost in a close bout to future lightweight champion English boxer Freddie Welsh on May 25, 1914 in a ten round newspaper decision at Pelican Stadium in New Orleans. The Times of Shreveport credited Welsh with five rounds, Mandot three, and two even.\\"Welsh Outpoints Mandot\\", The Times, Shreveport, Louisiana, pg. 13, 26 May 1914 The New Orleans lightweight defeated future world featherweight and jr. lightweight champion Johnny Dundee on July 4, 1914 in a close ten round newspaper decision of a no-decision bout in New Orleans. The Los Angeles Times, which believed Dundee won by a shade, admitted that Mandot won at long range in the majority of the rounds, but that Dundee fought better in the clinches. The Times gave Dundee the fourth through eighth by a slight margin, with Mandot taking the third, ninth and tenth.\\"Johnny Dundee Gets A Shade Over Joe Mandot\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 79, 5 July 1914 He defeated future world featherweight champion Johnny Kilbane on December 7, 1914 in a very close newspaper decision. The Boston Globe wrote that Mandot was fresher at the end of the rough match, and his face was unmarked.\\"Kilbane Gets Only a Draw\\", Boston Globe, Boston, Massachusetts, pg. 7, 8 December 1914 The referee gave only a slight edge to Mandot. Mandot drew in eight rounds with Jewish lightweight contender Frankie Callahan on December 14, 1914 in an eight round points decision in Memphis. The Los Angeles Times wrote that Mandot deserved the decision and that he had Callahan close to a knockout in the sixth, seventh, and eighth rounds, staggering him repeatedly.\\"Joe Mandot's Fight a Draw\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 25, 15 December 1914 In the opinion of one reporter, Mandot landed more blows in all but the first, second, and possibly eighth rounds, but the bout was close, and particularly fierce in the final round. A local newspaper gave Mandot four rounds, Callahan two, and two even. Callahan probably gained points from taking the offensive in much of the bout, but his blows lacked the steam of Callahan's.Shea, Coyle, \\"Mandot Entitled To Decision Over Frankie Callahan\\", The St. Louis Star and Times, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 12, 15 December 1914 =Contending for the world welterweight title= Ted \\"Kid\\" Lewis On October 26, 1915, he contended for the world welterweight championship against British Jewish boxer Ted \\"Kid\\" Lewis, losing in a twelve round points decision at the Arena in Boston. Lewis had a clear victory, dominating at both long range and infighting, though Mandot stood up to the punishment and kept several rounds even. Lewis scored strongly with his right, dropping Mandot in the first and twelfth rounds.\\"Ted Lewis Whales Joe Mandot Here\\", The Boston Globe, Boston, Massachusetts, pg. 6, 27 October 1915 Mandot fell to the incomparable future world lightweight champion Benny Leonard on December 17, 1915 in a seventh round knockout in New York. Never one to shrink from the toughest competition, The York Times wrote that the match, \\"was a brilliant display of scientific boxing and hard punching for the first six rounds\\". When Mandot rushed in the seventh, Leonard's straight left followed by a right cross to the jaw nearly ended the skillfully fought battle. Mandot rose to continue and was met with a final onslaught of blows from his challenger.Great display of scientific boxing in \\"Stops Boxing Bout to Save Wolgast\\", New York Times, New York, New York, pg. 8, 18 December 1915 Before his full retirement from boxing, Mandot considered going into the New Orleans real estate business around 1916 and purchased a few buildings after his retirement.\\"Hoppes Manager Here, Boxing Gossip\\", Seattle Star, Seattle, Washington, pg. 11, 2 November 1916 Mandot defeated Joe Thomas in a tenth round technical knockout in New Orleans on April 30, 1917.

The first four of these compilations, (Killed By Death #1-#4), were issued in 1989 by the Swedish label Redrum Records and featured tracks by obscure North American and European punk groups, as well as a few more well-known acts such as The Wipers, Zero Boys, Subhumans and the Beastie Boys.Killed By Death at Perfect Sound Forever. Referenced October 2010. In the years since the release of these first compilations, more than 50 other albums have been added to the series by various anonymous publishers. Origins In the early 1970s, musician Lenny Kaye had codified the term \\"punk\\" in reference to a genre of music with his compilation Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965‚Äì1968. The album highlighted minor 1960s hits by groups like The Standells, The Seeds, The Count Five and Electric Prunes mixed with similar-sounding tracks by lesser-known bands. Kaye's original Nuggets compilation sparked a wave of similar records, notably the Pebbles series of LPs, that sought to unearth rare music from the 1960s. Tim Warren's Crypt Records followed up with even rarer and rawer 60s punk rock recordings on its Back from the Grave albums released during the mid-1980s, as did many other small labels the world over. Meanwhile, a new generation of musicians had picked up on this music and, unlike their 1960s rolemodels, were conscientiously self-describing their music as \\"punk rock.\\" For many, this went hand-in-hand with a do-it-yourself aesthetic of recording one's own music and releasing one's own records, resulting in low budget productions and limited pressings. Not long after their release, the records were rare and as sought-after as many vinyl releases from punk's progenitors of the 1960s. Taking a cue from Nuggets, Pebbles and especially Back from the Grave, Killed By Death filled a niche for those desiring to hear this music for the first time.

The Killed By Death series was started by Swedish record collector Johan Kugelberg with the first volume's release in 1988, its name borrowed from a song by the British band Mot√∂rhead. Inspired by Tim Warren's Back from the Grave series, Kugelberg was encouraged by Warren to start his own series documenting early punk rock. Among the more obscure tracks by non- mainstream bands was the entire first EP by the Beastie Boys who had since switched from punk to hip-hop. When this first KBD record came out, the Beasties were topping the charts with their album Licensed to Ill while their hardcore punk catalog was out-of-print and selling for large sums on the collectors market, prompting Kugelberg to write in his KBD liner notes, \\"What do you do when a record becomes filthy expensive? Stick it on a comp.\\" By the end of 1989 Kugelberg's Redrum Records' had released the first four volumes of Killed By Death, after which a fifth and sixth Killed By Death emerged in 1993, issued by an Australian record collector. Over 30 subsequent volumes of Killed By Death were released during the 1990s, all assembled by various anonymous compilers and released independently of one another. This resulted in the records' diversion from any strict numbering system as no one could predict where and when a particular volume of Killed By Death would hit the streets. Many volumes of Killed By Death were limited to as few as 500 copies, resulting in these compilations of hard-to-find records becoming collectors' items in and of themselves. Many volumes of Killed By Death resembled mixtapes of assorted singles from people's personal collections seemingly with no particular rhyme or reason connecting them. Other volumes focused on bands from particular countries, such as France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Scotland or New Zealand. Several Killed By Death covers boasted \\"All American punk, no foreign junk,\\" while others homed in on punk rock from a specific U.S. state, such as punk singles from Florida or demo tapes by Californian punk bands. \\"Fake\\" volumes and spin-offs With no regulation of these releases, some volumes of Killed By Death were reputed to be of low quality or dubious origin. All the music on Killed By Death #16 is purported to be traceable back to a man named Mike Lucas covering 60s bands such as The Kingsmen, The Sonics, Steppenwolf, Velvet Underground and The Stooges. Killed By Death #11 boasted tracks by 10 unheard-of punk acts such as Sexy Fits, Curly Fries and Grumpy Winos, complete with cover art from the bands' original singles shoddily pasted (as was tradition on all Killed By Death releases) on the cover. However, only one of these groups was real‚Äîthe then contemporary Frothy Shakes from Nashville, Tennessee‚Äîand all the music on the record was theirs. As the series grew, several spin-off albums and series emerged borrowing the recognizable \\"Killed by\\" moniker and logo but replaced \\"Death\\" with another signifier. The ultra-rare (200 copies) Killed by Dentistry featured many tracks that appeared on previous Killed By Death collections. It came in a blood-spattered sleeve and is rumored to have been put out by an actual dentist. In the early 2000s an American enthusiast of Scottish punk and DIY music issued three CDs compiling tracks from rare Scottish singles under the name Kilt By Death. Further afield, other albums emerged with tiles like Killed by Synth, Killed by Glam, Killed by Hardcore, Killed by Meth and Killed by Deathrock.

Influence Satya Dharma is influenced by Islam, Humanism, Brahmo Samaj, Buddhism, Baul, Secularism, the Bhakti movement and Bengali culture. It was founded by Mohatma Gurunath Sengupta who was a great spiritual personality and a famous Bengali Sanskrit scholar and philosopher. He wrote many books about religion, humanity, philosophy, and ethics. There are 500,000 to 800,000 followers of this religion, scattered throughout West Bengal and Bangladesh. The shrine of Mohatma Gurunath Sengupta at Goalgram, Muksudpur, Gopalganj in Bangladesh is considered as one of the holy places by the followers. Some followers are in Maharashtra, India. The religion is created by Mahatma Gurunath Sengupta and it is spread by Mahatma Nibaran Chandra Pandey. It talks about the rule of living life and improve your qualities through pray to God. It tells God is one and we are the followers. Mahatma Gurunath Sengupta(1848-1914) Sanskrit scholar, was born at Narail in the district of jessore. Having passed his triannual examinations from Kolkata Normal School in 1867, he obtained the title of Kaviratna (A gem among poets). He taught at Ahiritola Bangabidyalay in Kolkata. He wrote several volumes of poems, commentaries and annotations, religious discourse and philosophy, novels and collections of essays in Sanskrit and Bangla. Among his important books in Sanskrit are Satyadharma (Eternal religion), Gunaratnam (Virtues), Satyamrta (The nectar of truth), Gunasutram (Aphoristic texts on virtues), Dharmajijnasa (Religious discourse), Shriramacharitam (an epic on Rama), Shrigaurabrttam (epic), Baridutam (The rain messenger), Patnishatakam (Verses on wives), Shiksashatakam (Verses on education) etc. Among his books in Bangla, Tattvajnan (Philosophy), Dampatidharmalap (Religious discourse of a couple), Adbhut Upakhyan (A strange story), Kamalini (epic) and Subhadraharan (epic) are admired. Gurunath Sengupta was also known as a votary of spiritualism. After austere ascetic practice and self-persuasion stretching for a period of over thirty years, he reached attainment and preached a new religious creed called satyadharma (eternal religion), which professed self-elevation through practice of virtues in the form of the worship of God. 8 times in a year followers from this religion met and pray to god they called it Utsab(Occasion) 6 of them invented by Mahatma Nibaran Chandra pandey.Every tuesday people from this religion met together and pray to God this one is created by Paresh chandra pandey son of Mahatma Nibaran Chandra pandey. Songs are written and composed by Mahatma Gurunath Sengupta ,Gourpriyo sarkar. Satyadharma mahamondal is the organization which is responsible for this religions activities.Mahatma Nibaran smriti rakhsa samiti,Satyadharma seva trust (Gujarat branch)are other responsible organization for taking this religion forward.

Greenpois0n's initial release in October 2010 jailbroke iOS 4.1, and its second version in February 2011 jailbroke iOS 4.2.1 as well as iOS 4.2.6 on CDMA iPhones. The second generation of the tool, Greenpois0n Absinthe, was developed with iPhone Dev Team members and jailbroke iOS 5.0.1 in January 2012 (providing the first jailbreak of the iPhone 4S), and a second version jailbroke iOS 5.1.1 in May 2012 (providing the first jailbreak of the third generation iPad). Jailbreaking enables root access to the iOS operating system, allowing the installation of applications and customizations that are unavailable through the official App Store for iOS. Jailbreaking voids the device's warranty, and Apple releases iOS updates to make jailbreaking more difficult.  Greenpois0n for iOS 4  On October 12, 2010, Chronic Dev Team released Greenpois0n, a desktop-based tool for jailbreaking iOS 4.1 on iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch third and fourth generation, and iPad 1. During its development, Apple released the second generation Apple TV, and Greenpois0n's developers reported that it could jailbreak the Apple TV as well. The developers announced plans to release it on October 10, but after news spread of another jailbreak developer, George Hotz, preparing to release a jailbreaking tool called limera1n that would perform a similar function with a different exploit, the Greenpois0n developers delayed in order to integrate the limera1n exploit, which supported more devices. Using limera1n also meant that the original Greenpois0n exploit (SHAtter) could be saved for use in later jailbreaks. Both SHAtter and limera1n are boot ROM exploits, which means they cannot be patched by iOS updates because boot ROM code is embedded in iOS devices during manufacturing. In February 2011, Chronic Dev Team released a new version of Greenpois0n to jailbreak iOS 4.2.1 and to jailbreak iOS 4.2.6 on CDMA (Verizon) iPhone 4, with desktop-based tools for OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. It provides an \\"untethered\\" jailbreak, which means that the jailbroken device can be rebooted without computer assistance. It supports iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and Apple TV. Chronic Dev Team announced support for the newly released CDMA iPhone 4 before the devices were in stores. =Chronic Dev Team= As of late 2011, Joshua Hill was described as a \\"head honcho\\" of Chronic-Dev Team,https://www.cnet.com/news/chronic-dev-team-gets-10m-crash- reports-in-first-week/ and as a principal.https://www.gsmarena.com/principle_devs_talk_untethered_ios_5_jailbreaking_and_more- news-3432.php Other members, in addition to Hill, in early 2012 included Cyril, and Nikias Bassen.https://www.cultofmac.com/168812/will-hackers-pull-a- one-more-thing-and-release-ios-5-1-1-jailbreak-this-friday/  Greenpois0n Absinthe for iOS 5  Developers from Chronic Dev Team and iPhone Dev Team released Greenpois0n Absinthe (sometimes simply known as just \\"Absinthe\\") in January 2012, a desktop-based tool (for OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux) to jailbreak the iPhone 4S for the first time and the iPad 2 for the second time, on iOS 5.0.1 for both devices and also iOS 5.0 for iPhone 4S. Absinthe provides an \\"untethered\\" jailbreak, which means that the patched device can be rebooted directly into a jailbroken state without computer assistance (or, as with a semi-untethered jailbreak, without requiring an application to be launched on the device following startup, in order to reactivate the jailbreak exploit). It incorporated the untether exploit called Corona that pod2g had released in December for older iOS devices. The Next Web said that the jailbreak took a long time to be released, and VentureBeat said Absinthe wasn't as easy to use as the earlier jailbreaking tool JailbreakMe. According to iPhone Dev Team, approximately one million devices were newly jailbroken in the three days after Absinthe's release. The developers called their joint effort the Jailbreak Dream Team, which Apple credited in its document listing security patches in the subsequent version of iOS. In May 2012, developers from Chronic Dev Team and iPhone Dev Team released Absinthe 2.0 (for OS X, Windows, and Linux), which can jailbreak iOS 5.1.1 untethered on all iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch models that support iOS 5.1.1, including jailbreaking the third generation iPad for the first time. They announced it at the Hack In The Box security conference in Amsterdam at the end of a presentation about the earlier Absinthe jailbreak, and it did not initially support a recently released model of iPad 2. According to Chronic Dev Team, approximately one million devices were jailbroken over the weekend after its Friday release.

As a former WWF pro-wrestler, and toy store elf, Tiny, a self-described \\"ghetto republican\\" has a difficult time being taken seriously. The fact that he is accused of having called in a threat to a local radio station doesn't help either. And yet, with the undying tenacity of the man, there is something bizarrely endearing about Tunstall. In the words of The Boston Globe, \\"He is afraid of no one and, in more lucid moments, he advocates for America‚Äôs have- nots in the heartfelt words of a guy who knows whereof he speaks.\\" Plot After spending years on the amateur wrestling circuit, and appearing on shows like WWF Monday Night Raw and The Jerry Springer Show, Tiny leaps into a political system where he is in over his head. Living on a fixed income, Tiny can't do much more than get out and shake hands with the voters. But when Dave Lewis, a wealthy backer comes to manage his campaign, things begin to take on a new life and a new struggle, this time within the campaign.

Herpesviruses have an envelope and an outer lipid bilayer which contains twelve surface glycoproteins. For infectivity to be attained, the double stranded DNA genome of HSV must enter the host cell through means of fusion of its envelope with the cellular membrane or via endocytosis. Other viral glycoproteins involved in the process of viral cell entry include gC, gB, gD, gH, and gL, but only gC, gB, gD, and gH are required for the fusion of the HSV's envelope with the cellular membrane. It can be noted that all herpesviruses have glycoproteins gB, gH, and gL.  Structure  The herpesvirus glycoprotein B is a type-1 transmembrane protein with a signal sequence at its N terminus. The crystal structure of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-1 and Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein B ectodomains were solved as a trimer, revealing five structural domains (I-V). Domain I contains two internal fusion loops, thought to insert into the cellular membrane during virus-cell fusion. In HSV, domain II is hypothesized to interact with another herpesvirus glycoprotein, gH/gL, during the fusion process. Domain III consists of a structurally important elongated alpha helix, while domain IV is hypothesized to interact with cellular receptors. Finally, domain V acts in conjunction with domain I during protein- lipid interactions. In HSV, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies map to structural domains I, II, IV and V. Due to its unique structure, herpesvirus glycoprotein B (along with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G and baculovirus gp64) belongs to a new class of viral membrane fusion glycoproteins, class III.  Function  The herpesvirus glycoprotein B is the most highly conserved of all surface glycoproteins and acts primarily as a fusion protein. The precise functions of gB and gH/gL are unknown but they are required for viral entry into the cell and constitute the core fusion machinery. The claim that gB is involved in fusion comes from the notable syncytial phenotype caused by certain mutations within the cytoplasmic domain of glycoprotein B, as well as its structural homology to other viral fusion proteins.

Fragmentary remains have been found from the Cenomanian-age Bahariya Formation of Egypt. The genus was named in 1936 by Oskar Kuhn. It is named in honor of Ernst Stromer, the German paleontologist who found the fossils in the Bahariya Oasis in 1911 and described them in 1922. After their discovery, the fossils, along with many others found from Bahariya, were in the possession of the Egyptian Geological Survey. In 1922, the fossils were sent back to Stromer (who was in Germany at the time), but they were badly crushed in shipment from Egypt. Because the known remains are so poor, the genus is now regarded as a nomen dubium.

It is also one of the largest activist funds in the world. It is the management affiliate of American hedge funds Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International Limited. The Elliott Corporation was founded by Paul Singer, who is CEO of the management company, based in New York City. As of the first quarter of 2015, Elliott's portfolio is worth over $8 billion. By 2009 \\"more than one-third of Elliott‚Äôs portfolio was concentrated in distressed securities, typically in the debt of bankrupt or near-bankrupt companies.\\" Elliott has widely been described as a vulture fund. Overview Singer created Elliott Associates in January 1977, starting with $1.3 million from friends and family and choosing the Elliott brand as it is his middle name. In its earliest years, the firm focused on convertible arbitrage. Since the 1987 stock market crash and early 1990s recession, however, the firm has transitioned into a multi-strategy hedge fund. Elliott Associates manages $8.6 billion and is Elliott Management's primary domestic fund. The firm is currently closed to new investors. As of mid-2008, Elliott counted 175 employees in New York City, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong and is one of the oldest hedge funds under continuous management. In a November 2014 investment letter, Elliott described optimism about U.S. growth as unwarranted. \\"Nobody can predict how long governments can get away with fake growth, fake money, fake jobs, fake financial stability, fake inflation numbers and fake income growth,\\" Elliott wrote. \\"When confidence is lost, that loss can be severe, sudden and simultaneous across a number of markets and sectors.\\" In 2015, Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Elliott an A grade and the #9 ranking among hedge funds worldwide. Equity partners Elliott has four equity partners. Paul Singer and Jon Pollock are co-chief investment officers; Gordon Singer, Paul Singer's son, runs Elliott‚Äôs London office. Steven Kasoff, formerly the firm's senior portfolio manager, was also given the title of equity partner in January 2015. Kasoff announced his retirement in April 2020.

Brice Mackosso, a campaigner for greater transparency and against corruption in the Congo Republic's government, stated that if it were not for funds like Elliott, \\"we would not know any facts about the way our country‚Äôs wealth is being taken away.\\" After Elliott's investigations produced evidence of corruption, the government settled for an estimated $90 million on debt for which Elliott paid less than $20 million. In 1995, Elliott bought $20 million face value of defaulted Peruvian bank debt. After extensive litigation and numerous attempts by Elliott to settle, the court awarded the hedge fund $58 million, including past due interest. =Alexion= Elliott acquired a position in Alexion Pharmaceuticals in 2017.

It is produced in the coagulogen form before being cleaved into the active form. The protein contains a single 175-residue polypeptide chain that is cleaved after Arg-18 and Arg-46 by a Limulus clotting enzyme contained in the hemocyte and activated by a bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). Cleavage releases two chains of coagulin, A and B, linked by two disulfide bonds, together with the peptide C. Gel formation results from interlinking of coagulin molecules. The full-length structure of a coagulogen is known (); it shares the same cystine-knot cytokine superfamily (fold) as neurotrophins, with several cystines conserved. The A-B fold wraps around the helical peptide C, forming a compact structure. Mammalian blood coagulation is based on the proteolytically induced polymerization of fibrinogens. Initially, fibrin monomers noncovalently interact with each other. The resulting homopolymers are further stabilized when the plasma transglutaminase cross-links bonds between molecules. In crustaceans, hemolymph coagulation depends on the transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of specific plasma-clotting proteins, but without the proteolytic cascade. In horseshoe crabs, the proteolytic coagulation cascade triggered by lipopolysaccharides and beta-1,3-glucans leads to the conversion of coagulogen into coagulin, resulting in noncovalent coagulin homopolymers through head-to-tail interaction. However, horseshoe crab transglutaminase does not cross-link coagulins intermolecularly. Recently, coagulins were discovered to be cross-linked on hemocyte cell surface proteins called proxins. This indicates that a cross-linking reaction at the final stage of hemolymph coagulation is an important innate immune system of horseshoe crabs.

Animals recognise a wide variety of chemicals using their senses of taste and smell. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has only 14 types of chemosensory neuron, yet is able to respond to dozens of chemicals because each neuron detects several stimuli. More than 40 highly divergent transmembrane proteins that could contribute to this functional diversity have been described. Most of the candidate receptor genes are in clusters of similar genes; 11 of these appear to be expressed in small subsets of chemosensory neurons. A single type of neuron can potentially express at least 4 different receptor genes. Some of these might encode receptors for water-soluble attractants, repellents and pheromones, which are divergent members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. Sequences of the Sra family of C. elegans receptor-like proteins contain 6-7 hydrophobic, putative transmembrane, regions. These can be distinguished from other 7TM proteins (especially those known to couple G-proteins) by their own characteristic TM signatures. More than 1300 potential chemoreceptor genes have been identified in C. elegans, which are generally prefixed sr for serpentine receptor. The receptor superfamilies include Sra (Sra, Srb, Srab, Sre), Str (Srh, Str, Sri, Srd, Srj, Srm, Srn) and Srg (Srx, Srt, Srg, Sru, Srv, Srxa), as well as the families Srw, Srz, Srbc, Srsx and Srr.

It is an endangered breed, and is classified by the Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentaci√≥n, the Spanish agriculture ministry, as an \\"autochthonous breed in danger of extinction\\".  History  The breed was considered the most prized in the eighteenth century, and the Spanish crown would not permit them to leave the country; however, King Charles III sent two males (jacks) to U.S. President George Washington in 1785. Only one jack survived the sea journey to Mount Vernon, and was named \\"Royal Gift\\".  Characteristics  The Andalusian is a large donkey, averaging at the withers, and of medium length. The head is of medium size, with a convex profile; the neck is muscular. The coat is short and fine, and soft to the touch; it is pale grey, sometimes almost white. The Andalusian is strong and sturdy, yet docile and calm. It is well adapted to the hot and arid conditions of its native environment. Status The current state of the Andalusian breed is critical.

He stands tall, and after a career in professional wrestling, ran for mayor of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 2006. His campaign was the subject of A Man Among Giants, a documentary film directed by Rod Webber. Personal life Douglas Allen Tunstall Jr. was born in Providence, Rhode Island on August 19, 1967. Tunstall is a dwarf who stands at 4 feet, 7 inches tall. His father was a Vietnam War veteran of normal height, though he says his mother was shorter than he is. Tunstall graduated from Central Falls High School in 1985, where he partook in scholastic wrestling and claims to have won the majority of his matches in the 98-to-105-pound class. He subsequently earned an associate's degree from Community College of Rhode Island and took science-related classes at Rhode Island College. Throughout the 1990s, Tunstall was arrested several times on misdemeanor charges that ranged from assaulting a police office to driving without a license. He was sentenced to six months‚Äô probation in 1996 for resisting arrest and disorderly conduct charges. A 1999 charge of simple assault was ultimately dismissed. Tunstall began a career in professional wrestling in the 1990s. He also worked seasonally for KB Toys, where he would portray a Christmas elf. In 2006, he said he had been receiving Social Security Disability Insurance since 1995. He estimates his income to be $10,000 a year. He is an African-American and a member of the Republican Party, which he says has made him unpopular with his friends. He supported George W. Bush because he \\"liked the way he carried himself\\". In 2004, he protested at the Democratic National Convention and told a New York Times reporter that any platform that promised to give people under five feet tall $1,200 a month would capture the dwarf demographic. Professional wrestling career Tunstall describes his time in wrestling, where he's better known under the monikers \\"Tiny the Terrible\\" and \\"Little Dougie Tunstall\\", as \\"more or less like therapy\\". He often made appearances on the independent circuit in the northeastern United States, including New England Championship Wrestling. Tiny the Terrible worked with Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1996, where he was present during the infamous Mass Transit Incident in which New Jack severed two of novice wrestler Erich Kulas' (Mass Transit's) arteries. In 1998, Tiny The Terrible defeated Half Nelson for the NWA World Midget's Championship. He held the championship for 167 days, before dropping it to Little Killer. In February 2000, he boasted that he could be a star in a major promotion if given the chance, stating: \\"If Vince McMahon gave me an opportunity to go in front of an audience, I guarantee I'd have a nation screaming my name.\\" Tunstall subsequently made two appearances on WWF/E Raw. On the March 13, 2000 episode of Raw, he appeared as one half of \\"The Twin Towers\\", a dwarf duo that Stephanie McMahon joked would face The Rock at WrestleMania 2000. He wrestled his only WWE match on the July 25, 2005 episode of Raw under the ring name Cloacas, where he teamed with Viscera to take on Antonio of The Heart Throbs and Pocket Rocket in a winning effort. His notoriety in wrestling led to three appearances on The Jerry Springer Show. In 2020, Tunstall was part of a Dark Side of the Ring episode involving New Jack, in which he recounted the Mass Transit incident. 2006 Pawtucket mayoral election Tunstall ran as a Republican in the 2006 Pawtucket mayoral election. His candidacy made him the first African-American to seek the office. He ran against the well funded eight-year Democratic incumbent James Doyle, and stated he would use \\"ghetto-style politics\\" such as door-to-door campaigning. His platform included opposing same-sex marriage, encouraging NASA to build a base in Pawtucket and giving stipends to those who took in homeless people. Ultimately, Tunstall lost the election after only collecting 17 percent of the vote. His candidacy was the subject of the documentary film, A Man Among Giants.

Bradford Art Galleries and Museums. Cartoon for Queen Guenevere and Isoude Les Blanches Mains, William Morris, 1862. Tate Britain, London. The Tristram and Isoude stained glass panels are a series of 13 small stained-glass windows made in 1862 by Morris, Marshall, Faulker & Co. for Harden Grange, the house of textile merchant Walter Dunlop, near Bingley in Yorkshire, England. Depicting the legend of Tristan and Iseult, they were designed by six of the leading Pre-Raphaelite artists of the day, to an overall design by William Morris. They were acquired in 1917 by Cartwright Hall Art Gallery, which is now part of Bradford Museums & Galleries. They can be seen on display at Cliffe Castle, Keighley. Details The 13 smallThe panels average 68 x 60.5 cm; Poulson, Christine, \\"'That Most Beautiful of Dreams': Tristram and Isoude in British Art of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries\\". In Grimbert (2002), p. 339 stained-glass panels depict scenes from the story of Sir Tristram and la Belle Isoude as told in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur.Wroot (1917), p. 69Poulson, pp. 338-339Lawson (1985) They were commissioned by Walter Dunlop, a Bradford textile merchant, for a new music room to be built at Harden Grange, his house near Bingley, Yorkshire, and were designed and executed in 1862 by Morris, Marshall, Faulker & Co., the decorative arts firm established the year before by the Pre-Raphaelite artist William Morris in partnership with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown, Philip Webb, Charles Faulkner and Peter Paul Marshall.Harvey & Press (1991), p. 38 This was the firm's first commission for windows for a private residence, or with a non-ecclesiastical subject, and Morris provided Dunlop with a hand-written programme for the proposed work headed \\"Short abstract of the Romance of Tristram\\", with marginal annotations suggesting the pictorial possibilities of the story. To design the cartoons or preparatory drawings for the individual panels, Morris turned to four of the artists who had worked with him in 1857 on another project based on the Arthurian legend as retold by Malory, the Oxford Union murals‚ÄîRossetti, Burne-Jones, Val Prinsep and Arthur Hughes‚Äîplus his partner Madox Brown.Wroot (1917), p. 73 Morris himself designed four of the 13 panels and maintained the cohesiveness of the series through his overall design, matching text blocks, placement of the lead lines, and selection of colours, including deep ruby-reds and olive greens.Wroot (1917), p. 73 The subjects of the 13 panels and their designers are:Wroot (1917), pp. 69-73 # The Birth of Sir Tristram (Hughes) # The Fight between Sir Tristram and Sir Marhaus (Rossetti) # The Departure of Tristram and Isoude from Ireland (Prinsep) # Tristram and Isoude drink the Love Potion (Rossetti) # The Marriage of Tristram and Isoude Les Blanches Mains (Burne- Jones) # The Madness of Tristram (Burne-Jones) # The Attempted Suicide of La Belle Isoude (Burne-Jones) # The Recognition of Tristram by La Belle Isoude (Burne-Jones) # At the Court of King Arthur (Morris) # King Mark slays Tristram (Madox Brown) # The Tomb of Tristram and Isoude (Burne-Jones) # Queen Guenevere and Isoude Les Blanches Mains (Morris) # King Arthur and Sir Launcelot (Morris) The Tristram and Isoude windows were acquired by the Bradford Art Gallery in 1917, along with documentation relating to the subject matter of the panels and their installation, including the \\"Short abstract\\".

The aim of the Euroleague American Tour is to expose to American basketball fans a different basketball approach than the one presented by the NBA, a lot more similar to the NCAA one. The Euroleague teams that participated in that first edition were Partizan Belgrade, Olympiacos and Maccabi Tel Aviv. On the other hand, the NBA franchises that played against them were the Denver Nuggets, the Phoenix Suns, the San Antonio Spurs, the New York Knicks and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The NBA rules that applied to the event combined with the fact that the opponents were all top class NBA teams led to consecutive losses for the Euroleague representants. In Partizan's case, things were even worse as they competed without future All-Euroleague point guard Bo McCalebb and power forward Lawrence Roberts. Overall, in spite of the fact that Euroleague teams seemed unable to threaten their NBA competition within the United States, they demonstrated some of the advantages that make them high-class basketball organizations: Solid fundamentals, outstanding team play and some of the best players of FIBA Basketball like Theo Papaloukas, Milo≈° Teodosiƒá, Aleks Mariƒá, Ioannis Bourousis and Sofoklis Schortsanitis to name a few.

He was elected in the 2010 municipal election with 39% of the vote, and is the first Muslim mayor of a large North American city. He was re-elected in 2013 with 74% of the vote. He was again re-elected in 2017 to a third term with 51% of the vote. Early life, education, and career Nenshi was born in Toronto, Ontario, and raised in Calgary. His parents, Kurbanali Hussein and Noorjah, were Ismaili Muslim immigrants of Indian origin to Canada from Tanzania. He was educated at the University of Calgary, serving as President of the Students' Union and receiving a Bachelor of Commerce in 1993, and completed a Master of Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1998. Nenshi worked for McKinsey & Company for several years before starting his own consulting firm 'Ascend Group' which advised non-profit, private and public sector organizations to grow. The firm also advised the United Nations on ways to encourage wealthy corporations to engage in Corporate Citizenship. As a young professional, he developed his administrative capabilities by joining Canada25, a federal networking organization that mentored professionals under 35 of public policy and leadership. Nenshi was a constant debate opponent of Toronto Sun journalist Ezra Levant; Levant later became a recurring critic of Nenshi's policies. In 2002, Nenshi wrote about how cities can retain young professionals and use resources effectively in a publication entitled \\"Building Up: Making Canada's Cities Engines of Growth and Magnets of Development\\". In 2006, Nenshi was the chief author for \\"ImagineCalgary's 100-year plan\\". He has co-founded two citizens' groups aimed at improving Calgary's civic government. In 2009, Nenshi was invited to become a founding member of Civic Camp, an active citizenship forum that encourages and enables Calgarians to actively engage and collaborate ideas in civic affairs. He co-founded city hall watch dog group \\"Better Calgary Campaign\\". He was an instructor in non-profit management in the Bissett School of Business at Mount Royal University and wrote a regular municipal affairs column for the Calgary Herald.  Electoral record  Nenshi giving a campaign speech in July 2010 Nenshi speaking to supporters and media shortly after being projected to win =2010 mayoral election= Nenshi first ventured into politics in 2004, running unsuccessfully for a seat on Calgary's city council. His 2010 campaign for mayor, dubbed the \\"Purple Revolution\\", was uniquely a viral campaign which relied heavily on using social media to promote his platform and hyper-engage voters. According to Nenshi's campaign I.T. specialist Richard Einarson, the name \\"Purple Revolution\\" was chosen because the campaign wanted broad appeal across the socio-economic spectrum of liberal red and conservative blue voters. Nenshi in 2010 Beside viral campaigning, the volunteer body of \\"Team Nenshi\\" were given a great degree of autonomy to exercise creative talent. The team promoted the cause through creative guerrilla marketing tactics such as \\"Operation Purple Dawn\\". Nenshi's supporters converged on the city in a mass rally on the evening before election day. They advertised Nenshi by posting signs and writing platform slogans with chalk graffiti on pavement of high traffic locations. Supporters offered their homes as venues for coffee parties where Nenshi spoke to the gathered about his platform. The coffee parties offered a friendly atmosphere for friends to discuss the volatile nature of sensitive political issues without risking their relationships. About 40 parties were held during the campaign. A late September poll showed that his campaign was generating interest as he sat third with eight per cent support, although well behind the leaders, alderman Ric McIver (42%) and local media personality Barb Higgins (28%). His growing popularity led to greater scrutiny of his views, including a public dispute with Calgary Police Service chief Rick Hanson over the cost of policing the city. Days before the election, a Calgary Herald poll showed that Nenshi's grassroots campaign continued to gain momentum as he had 30 per cent support among decided voters, placing him in a statistical tie with McIver and Higgins. He polled the strongest amongst younger voters, believed to be the result of his social media campaign. Nenshi's surge in popularity carried through to the election, when he earned 40 per cent of the vote, finishing nearly 28,000 votes ahead of second-placed McIver. Being a Shia Ismaili, Nenshi became the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city. His win was viewed as a breakthrough for the use of social media as an election tool, and when considered with his faith and background, made international headlines. His election is seen as major signal of the shift in Albertan politics and the demography of Calgary. He engaged voters with a mutual two-way dialogue as \\"politics in full sentences\\". Vandalism and email attacks On September 11, 2010, 20 of Nenshi's campaign advertisements in the city were vandalized or destroyed and a brick was thrown through one of his campaign office's windows. The attacks, which commemorated the ninth anniversary of the September 11 attacks in New York City, were accompanied by a series of racially antagonistic emails. They were therefore widely assumed to be racially motivated. =2013 mayoral election= 2013 mayoral campaign During this fundraising Gala, Nenshi issued a challenge to his opponents to confront him directly and not to engage him in a proxy campaign of lobbying as he warns his supporters that his opponents will likely engage in. In September 2013 when Nenshi's campaign began in earnest, he revealed the donors of his campaign before the election and urged his opponents to do likewise. Nenshi promised to instigate changes to improve the transparency of City Hall's municipal affairs as one of his 2010 campaign statements. According to the documents Nenshi's 1631 supporters derive from a wide range of core supporters. Among Nenshi's larger contributors were contractors from the housing construction industry, which according to Nenshi indicates that not all among the trade were antagonistic to Nenshi's anti- urban sprawl policies enacted early in his term. =Abolition of developer subsidy= For his campaign platform, Nenshi proposed to abolish the $4,800 granted to home builders, aiming to save the city $33 million per annum. According to Nenshi, the subsidy over a decade contributed to the municipal debt of $1.5 billion. Nenshi wanted free market factors to take hold of the housing market and developers to contribute to funding infrastructure to far- reaching suburbs by paying levies. The Manning Centre for Building Democracy supported the motion as supporting free market principles. The group however believed developers should pay slightly increased taxes as long as inner city communities equally also contribute their share of growth costs. =International Avenue business redevelopment zone= In October 2013, Nenshi and Councillors Andre Chabot and Gian-Carlo Carra proposed to realize a 2008 plan by then-Mayor Dave Bronconnier to redevelop International Avenue (17th Ave SE) as a vital transportation hub. Since inception the plan in 2010 the project has been delayed due to costs. The plan incorporates a C-train line and rapid bus lanes, proposed in Calgary Transit's 'Route Ahead' plan. As well the revitalization incorporates urban renewal projects like renovated apartments and business buildings. Carra studied the circumstances for Forest Lawn's urban decay and planned the neighborhood's restoration as his master thesis. Carra explains that the neighborhood has not been adequately integrated since the neighborhood was incorporated into Calgary since 1961. Third mayoral election Nenshi indicated his intention to run for a 3rd term on November 4, 2016. On October 16, 2017, Nenshi won a third term winning over 50% of the vote. The third election has been wrought with controversy as select neighbourhoods ran out of ballots and waiting lines to vote were hours long, resulting in lost votes. Mayoralty =Positions = In 2013, Nenshi supported the proposed Keystone XL pipeline network. He explained that opposition and protests were foolish as the pipe network could mitigate environmental damage caused from the transport of oil. In 2014, Nenshi refused to present musician Neil Young with a Calgary White Hat, a traditional token of the city's hospitality to prominent guests. Nenshi stated that he did not normally present honours to entertainers. Young was performing his Honour the Treaties benefit tour to raise legal funds on behalf of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation. The ACFN is appealing government approval to expand fracking on their territory. In 2014, Nenshi delivered a speech to the Calgary Economic Development speakers' series on diversity. Nenshi explained that there was a lack of ethnic and gender diversity among senior city staff. Nenshi stated that although the city had an excellent record hiring minorities and women they may experience a ceiling to promotions and advancement. In 2017 Calgary, as with many municipalities in Western Canada, recorded an increase in the number overdoses and fatalities related to an opioid epidemic. During conference of Canadian mayors, Nenshi invited the federal government to use Calgary as a test city to implement harm reductionist pilot projects and gather research indigenous to Calgary's unique needs.Pike, H. \\"Nenshi volunteers Calgary as place to get pilot fentanyl harm reduction tactics\\", Calgary Metro, Retrieved April 29, 2017. Retrieved from http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2017/02/02/nenshi-wants-calgary-to-lead- fentanyl-harm-reduction-pilot.html Although Nenshi's second term council voted to end addition of fluoride to Calgary's drinking water, he personally supports water fluoridation. He does however support more depth in the research literature related to municipal water fluoridation.CBC. \\"Nenshi would vote to reintroduce fluoride in Calgary drinking water with public support\\", CBC, retrieved from http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/nenshi-supports- return-of-fluoride-in-drinking-water-1.3459040, retrieved on April 29, 2017. Calgary has undertaken five plebiscites on water fluoridation, initially voting in favor of the practice in 1998. In 2016, the city council rejected a call for another vote, but in January 2019, Ward 11 Councillor Jeromy Farkas requested a report on the history and cost of water fluoridation from the city administration in preparation for a possible 2021 plebiscite. Relationship with housing industry Nenshi's policies of exercising greater city control over urban growth to manage urban sprawl is one of his key campaign promises. As expected, Nenshi's council has regularly collided with key associations of Calgary's housing industry. Frictions between the Nenshi council and key housing industry associations are an ongoing, overlapping, and escalating affair. Grievances continuously surfaced during the 2013 election, for example the \\"Cal Wenzel video\\", rumour-mongering about a pro-development slated council, and upcoming Wenzel slander lawsuit of 2014. Early in 2013, Nenshi's council suspended relations with the Calgary branch of the Canadian Home Builders' Association. The CHBA as a result was banned briefly from attending planning sessions. This action was conducted after the Calgary branch president Charron Ungar commented that the city was enacting a policy of \\"suburban freeze\\". Ungar commented upon a city plan which scheduled two suburb developments within 10 years. Nenshi declared that the CHBA and the Urban Development Institute (UDI) were representing the housing industry poorly after a controversial article was published by the UDI. The article suggested that minorities might not find suburban living comfortable. Nenshi suspended relations with the UDI soon after the article was published. Nenshi also felt that it was more expedient for the city to deal directly with the construction industry. Cal Wenzel housing lobby video In 2013, a video was leaked of Cal Wenzel, the CEO and founder of Shane Homes, speaking to panel of Calgarian home builders about a plan to influence the decisions of the city council after the upcoming elections. In the video Wenzel spoke of plans to raise $1.1 million to enlist the support of Preston Manning's conservative foundation the Manning Centre for Building Democracy. According to the speech, former Mayor Dave Bronconnier counselled Wenzel on how to control council motions with eight votes. ‚ÄúSo for whatever and however, we have to ensure that we end up with the eight votes.‚Äù Wenzel proposed as a solution to circumvent direct confrontation with Nenshi's popularity. Wenzel named councillors the industry could rely on to support motions in favor of the lobby and he supported with donations. Nenshi has ordered a probe into what he described as distasteful and shadowy possible violations of electoral laws. In the wake of the release of this video, and violations of campaign fund limits set at $5,000, the Manning Centre has come under scrutiny. In late 2013, Wenzel filed a $6 million slander lawsuit against Nenshi after he stated that Nenshi did not apologize after sufficient time given. Wenzel stated that his reputation was tarnished and he was vilified as a subject of political opportunism during Nenshi and his allied counselor's platform campaigning. Wenzel stated that his comments in the video were taken out of context and manipulated by Nenshi to promote an agenda. Wenzel also complained of Nenshi tentatively comparing him to 'Godfather', as a reference to the titular character of Mario Puzo's novel and screenplay The Godfather. Nenshi in an interview with David Gray, host of CBC Radio's Calgary Eyeopener, described the meeting as scene from the film The Godfather. When asked to clarify if called Wenzel the \\"Godfather\\", Nenshi ambiguously responded \\"maybe\\". The two reached an out-of-court settlement in December 2015, under which Nenshi agreed to apologize for and retract several comments he had made, while Wenzel expressed regret for any harm done to Nenshi's reputation and agreed that Nenshi has raised legitimate concerns about the potential chilling effect of lawsuits against politicians. Nenshi's legal bill of nearly $300,000 was paid by donations. Pro-development candidate slate Preston Manning, founder of the Manning Centre for Building Democracy, responded in an interview with CBC News about the foundation being referred to in the Cal Wenzel lobbyist video. He stated that Calgarians don't want lobby slates of any position in municipal politics, but rather independent candidates who will represent them. Manning explained that the purpose of the 'municipal government program' is to train fiscal conservative candidates for the election, but to respect the democratic process and not to interfere with city politics. Manning stated that he didn't believe in intimidation. Manning also states that the foundation is also to function as a research think tank that conducts research on social issues. However, according to a paper entitled \\"Managing the Cost of Growth\\" published by the Manning Centre in October 2013 the report's recommendations coincided with Nenshi's campaign policy to abolish the subsidy to home building companies As long as inner city communities are likewise subjected to contributing to growth costs. The study also advocated increased taxes for newer outlying communities that need specialized utilities such as water and roads. =Calgary-Tsuu T'ina Nation relationships= Throughout his term, Nenshi has met extensively with Chief Roy Whitney leader of neighbouring Tsuu T'ina Nation, and former Chief Sandford Big Plume to discuss matters of mutual assistance with growth. In 2011, Nenshi and Big Plume negotiated tentative agreements to ensure the security of greater access safety services such as emergency medical services, police, and fire. The city agreed to provide utilities, such as water, to support the expansion of the Grey Eagle Casino, possibly allowing water works extension throughout the Tsuu T'ina community in the future. =Comparison to Rob Ford= The press has made many comparisons dubbed as \\"Nenshi vs Ford\\" comparing Nenshi to Mayor Rob Ford of Toronto, because of the similarities of both mayors being first term and the uncanny similar challenges Toronto and Calgary faced. Nenshi became the first Calgarian mayor to marshal the Calgary Pride parade. Ford declined to marshal the Toronto Pride Parade citing that visiting his family cottage was an unbreakable tradition. They compare the stellar rise of Nenshi to the controversies surrounding Ford. Although the comparisons are allegorical examples of the differences of the administration, there was an actual \\"Nenshi vs Ford\\" challenge issued by Nenshi. Nenshi challenged Ford to a friendly bet during the 2012 Grey Cup where the Calgary Stampeders played the Toronto Argonauts. In 2012 Ford challenged Nenshi among other mayors to a fitness weight loss challenge. =Public works and infrastructure projects= Soon after assuming the office, Nenshi's council implemented many developments to revitalize Calgary's viability with capital infrastructure projects, such as redevelopment of the East Village neighbourhood with the New Central Library and the National Music Centre. Through a partnership with the local arts community, the city will preserve the historic King Edward School as an arts hub. Funding for these projects will mainly draw upon the Community Investment Fund, a fund created from tax revenue sources such as a $42 million annual refund from the provincial government The goals of urban revitalization are planned to be realized through initiatives such as Supporting Partnership for Urban Reinvestment (SPUR). Nenshi's council debuted SPUR's pilot project as the restoration of the Kingsland neighborhood. The city solicited feedback from the community and expects to budget $230,000. The project was delayed until August by the floods of 2013. The Nenshi administration completed capital public works projects approved by his predecessor Dave Bronconnier, including the westerly extension of the C-Train line, Peace Bridge, and the construction of a traffic tunnel to the Calgary International Airport, which has been completed. Nenshi's council voted to discontinue fluoridating Calgary's water supply in February 2011. As part of his campaign, Nenshi advocated to legalize \\"secondary housing\\" as a solution to housing shortage. A proposed bylaw is intended to create standardized safety requirements for the estimated 10,000‚Äì40,000 secondary suites which exist in the city. As one of the last decisions of Nenshi's term in 2013, the city motioned to waive the $4,485 application fee for rezoning of secondary suites. However, the decision will have to be brought into effect during the next government's term. In 2013 the city approved a project to convert a block of derelict heritage buildings adjacent to the Central United Church into a first-of-its-kind robotic carpark. The facility will accommodate 338 cars and incorporate the renovated buildings, which the managing firm agrees to restore. Nenshi states this will improve the aesthetics of the eyesore skid row-like buildings. The project is planned to be self-funding as Calgary firm Heritage Property Corporation will attempt to raise the $40 million through private investment. Nenshi ordered an investigation to find cost-effective solutions for a sanitary capacity issues affecting residents of northwest Calgary. If the $50 million expansion of the at-capacity Bowness sanitary line is not implemented, development in new and established communities in the quadrant may be delayed until 2017. The sanitary line also provides the town of Cochrane, contributing to the strain. Nenshi expressed distaste of the free-standing public art project entitled the \\"Travelling Light\\" completed in 2013. He described the work as \\"awful and not the best use of tax dollars\\". The sculpture was sited along Airport Trail and drivers could not appreciate the \\"Big O\\" according to Nenshi. Travelling Light is described as a balanced 17-metre circle ring topped with balanced street lights. The motif of Travelling Light is supposed to represent transportation. The sculpture cost Calgary $471,000 and was paid through a grant from the Public Art Program, which reserves 1% of the annual budget for public art projects. The sculpture was chosen during Bronconnier's term by a panel of 5 Calgarians out of a pool of 55 submissions. Travelling Light's submission was from a German artist, although three submissions were from Calgarians. City consultation with environmental research group  Mounting international, domestic, and celebrity criticism of Alberta's underdeveloped green technology infrastructure prompted former Premier Ed Stelmach's government to commit $4 billion to a province-wide green capital projects plan in 2009. In 2009 former Calgary Mayor Dave Bronconnier and Pembina Institute were awarded the 'Reaching Out to Global Energy Award' at the UN Climate Change Summit for the technical and engineering collaboration with Calgary's \\"Greening the Grid\\" program. Pembina scholars compiled the 'Options for Reducing GHG Emissions in Calgary' to advise the city on how to implement infrastructure projects for environmental protection. The city acted on these recommendations through city-owned company Enmax; decided on a series of public works facilities such as the Shepard Energy Centre, and a 12-turbine wind farm that supplies wind power for Calgary Transit's C-trains, and the District Energy Centre, a heat capture energy plant providing heat and energy for the downtown core. The city publication of the \\"Greening the Grid\\" was entitled \\"Calgary Climate Change Action Plan: Target (down arrow) 50\\" (Target Minus 50). The \\"Greening the Grid\\" program's objectives are to empower city facilities by renewable sources by 2012. Calgary Transit's C-trains' electrical needs were partially provided by wind power in 2001, by 2009 the inception year of \\"Greening the Grid\\", the CTrain were fully empowered by \\"Ride the Wind\\", a program launched by Enmax and wind power engineers Vision Quest Windlectric. committed $250 million on the 'Greening the grid' program. In 2013, Sun Media journalist Ezra Levant said the city of Calgary contracted $340,000 to Pembina which he accused of being an anti-oil lobby group with insufficient scientific credentials. Sun Media journalist Renato Gandia mentioned the Pembina Institute's contracts in an article with the headline \\"Mayor Naheed Nenshi says work done by left-leaning Pembina Institute think tank was not political in nature\\". Nenshi said it would be reasonable to hire the \\"best guy\\" regardless of personal political values. The affair concluded with a Twitter argument when Nenshi responded to Levant's questioning. Levant questioned Nenshi about the ethics of city funds going to Pembina, if Pembina staff had worked on or donated to Nenshi's political campaigns. Nenshi responded by asking Levant rhetorically 'when did you stop beating your wife?' Enmax Nenshi ordered a corruption graft probe into the finances of city-owned utility company Enmax after an unknown senior employee revealed lavish spending by former Enmax CEO Gary Holden in 2010 in an email report. Holden was reported to have organized extravagant house celebrations entertained by rock stars, using Calgarian taxpayers' funds. Holden also gradually raised his salary from $700,000 to $2.7 millionJ. Connelly, Canada Business Review, Jan 21, 2011.'Enmax CEO Gary Holden Ousted after a string of Scandals' http://www.businessreviewcanada.ca/sectors/enmax-ceo-gary-holden- ousted-after-string-scandals retrieved Oct 9, 2013 Holden resigned in 2011 after CBC News revealed a business trip to Monaco in 2008. Holden was a guest of German software company SAP and conducted business and watched the Monaco Grand Prix. Holden violated Enmax ethics policy to disclose incidents of gifts over $100. Holden earned the 5th place distinction of Forbes top 10 CEO screw ups for 2010. By the terms of contract Holden was granted a significant severance pay of $4.6 million. Prior to the 2010 election, mayoral candidates McIver and Nenshi debated the justification for extravagant privileges of senior Enmax staff in their debates. Candidate Nenshi warned that Enmax was a city-run company and funds were taxpayers'. McIver described Enmax as an \\"Air of Entitlement\\". In 2011, in the wake of Holden's resignation, Nenshi's council and Enmax's board implemented reforms such as decreasing the salaries of senior staff, and a higher meritorious standard for bonuses. Enmax hired new management and a new CEO Gianna Manes, who is experienced in mass project completion such as the Shepard Energy Centre for which Holden advocated. In 2011, Nenshi performed the ground breaking ceremony for Enmax's Shepard Energy Centre, a natural gas power plant capable of generating 800MW, more than half the electrical needs of Calgary. The facility was announced fully operational on March 11, 2015. The facility is described as Calgary's biggest project and cost $1.4 billion. Nenshi's council approved of the project which was planned during Bronconnier's term. The Shepard Energy Centre is connected to the Albertan power grid. Public works of second term Nenshi's council granted $5.5 million to build the 200-seat \\"Decidedly Jazz Danceworks Dance Centre\\" in the Belt Line neighbourhood. The new facility will address the expansion requirements of the Decidedly Jazz dance academy. The council decided that the facility would address the need to provide a permanent venue for the distinguished academy that served Calgary for many years. According to Nenshi, the facility will also help to fill the need in Calgary for more performing arts venues. Nenshi also hopes that this development would help stimulate development in the Beltline. Arena dispute Since 2015, Nenshi and the Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation (CSEC) have been struggling to reach an agreement on the construction of a new arena for the Calgary Flames. In 2015, the Flames proposed \\"CalgaryNEXT\\", an arena which would include both a hockey rink and a fieldhouse for the Calgary Stampeders. After deeming the costs too high, the City counter-proposed with \\"Plan B\\", a hockey arena for the Victoria Park area in Downtown Calgary. After the Flames ended arena talks with the city in 2017 following financing disputes, the City revealed their proposal to the public: 1/3 of the money would come from the city, 1/3 from CSEC, and 1/3 from profits. =Transportation= The city constructed its first of many bicycle lanes in the downtown core. By 2020, it is estimated that the city will have 30 km of cycle lanes. In 2014, a plan will be submitted to begin to extend the network and enact a bylaw. In late 2013, the city has entered into speculative agreement with the Tsuu T'ina to resume negotiating the extension of Stoney Trail through a portion of Tsuu T'ina land for a ring road. The band members were to vote in a referendum in October of the same year to decide on the issue. The city was in negotiations for over 50 years, with the last proposal in 2009 being rejected. Nenshi described the proposal as \\"win-win-win\\", however, should the band decide to ratify the agreement, construction won't commence for two years. On October 24, 2013, Tsuu T'ina tribe members voted in a referendum to permit the construction of the ring road on their territory. In exchange for 450 hectares of land, the nation will be compensated with 2,150 hectares of Crown land to expand their territories. The nation will also receive $340 million. Calgary Transit Calgary Transit presented Nenshi's administration with the \\"RouteAhead\\" plan for review. The plan calls for $13 billion to be invested over 30 years to expand and upgrade Calgary Transit's capabilities, for which funding is still pending. To address the problem of congestion of rush hour ridership, the city is upgrading busy C-train platforms to accommodate four-car trains. The city council has approved $200 million for the acquisition of 60 new four-car trains to replace obsolete U2 units which have served Calgary Transit since 1981. It is expected that the increased frequency of the trains will relieve crowded and full trains. Nenshi abolished the $3 park-and-ride fees to encourage more commuters to use Calgary's Public Transit. Later, the decision was made to charge a $70 monthly fee for reserved parking. Relationship with Canadian Pacific Railway After Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) cancelled an environmental study of the expansion of Alyth train yard, the city approved to continue funding the study environmental impact the yard causes the residents of adjacent Inglewood and Ramsay neighborhoods. Nenshi attacked Canadian Pacific over the reassignment of the company's night crew. The company decided to close the 'Locomotive Reliability Centre' of the Alyth train yard. Transport Canada ordered it to relocate 400m away, as residents complained of the noise. Nenshi rebuked CP over the collapse of the 101-year-old Bonnybrook Bridge. The bridge was weakened by the 2013 Alberta floods, as its structural supports were washed away by surging flood waters. He blamed a massive layoff prior to the accident for lax inspection standards and called for cities to have greater management of CP affairs within their cities. Nenshi and CP agreed to improve communication in the future and improve relationships after several cars transporting petroleum derailed in late September 2013. = Social initiatives and amendments to bylaws = The Nenshi administration initiated many programs to improve civic administration and clarify transparency of city political affairs, organized around themes such as \\"transforming government\\" and \\"cutting red tape\\". These initiatives are intended to improve the business and quality of life for Calgarians. The Cutting red tape initiative was estimated to have saved Calgarians 33,000 in hours and $1.12 million in productivity. Nenshi sought the advice of Calgarians for further feedback and ideas of how to make city services easier to access in 2012 for its third phase of cutting red tape. The term alderman was changed to the gender-neutral councillor. In 2011, Nenshi was advised by civil advocacy group Civic Camp to challenge the citizens of Calgary with an initiative to personally take responsibility and encourage their neighbours do three things to improve their community for '3 Things for Calgary Program'. In 2013, Nenshi implemented the 'Enough for All' program to half the demographic of 50,000 Calgarians living in poverty by 2023. The plan doesn't call for more spending, but to uncover and administer effective solutions to connect disadvantaged Calgarians with resources and the community. Nenshi made implementing this solution as one of his campaign promises. The town of Airdrie passed an anti-bullying bylaw that was advocated by Airdrie teen Mackenzie Murphy in 2013 after she survived a suicide attempt in December 2012. She was persecuted for two years by online bullying and at school as her classmates suggested that she should kill herself. Airdrie Mayor Peter Brown, who was sympathetic to her distress, tasked his council to investigate the legal precedence to enact the bylaws. She hopes to meet Nenshi to advocate for similar laws in Calgary and spread public awareness of bullying. Nenshi and Premier Redford expressed interest in her activism. Nenshi Chief of staff Chima Nkemdirim, suggests that Nenshi is open to dialog should she decide to take the initiative by scheduling an appointment. In 2013, the city council enacted a bylaw banning smoking in playgrounds and other places where family and children play. The length of council terms was extended from three years to four years. Calgary Police and crime Continuing on a downward trend of violent crimes since 1991, Calgary's together with Canada's crime rate has dropped. As of 2013 the national crime rate has dropped below levels since 1971. It is unknown what has caused the decline in violent crimes; however, Statistics Canada analyst Mary Allen correlates that communities with higher standards of socio-economic conditions tend to have low crime rates. Many other urban areas have experienced similar decreases in crime rates, and recent studies suggest this may primarily be due to decreased environmental levels of lead. Calgary has experienced significant percentage drops since 2011, such as a 23% drop in robberies. In 2012 Calgary's Crime Severity Index of 60.5 is below national rating of 75. In 2013, community service groups and the Calgary Police Service banded together to form the Safe Communities Opportunity and Resource Centre (SCORCe) as a cooperative effort to improve effective services for vulnerable Calgarians. Nenshi opened the centre in a ceremony. In September 2013, the city extended the contract of Police Chief Rick Hanson until 2017. Nenshi credits his leadership as a factor for Calgary's low crime fortunes. =Enterprise and financial initiatives= The city created the Community Investment Fund to grant $252 million between 2012 and 2016 to renovate and construct new Calgarian public recreation and community facilities such as libraries. The fund provides funding for community groups to renovate their facilities that provide services to Calgarians. The fund is composed from major sources such as annual rebate of $42 million from the Alberta government, $4 million from GST refund, and $150 million from a fund created by urban developers for community growth. The fund was a response to address the need for access for recreational services, especially sports and physical facilities for children. Such as ice rinks and swimming pools. The fund also addresses the need for renovations for many aging facilities providing essential services for Calgarians. The city will construct four new facilities providing access for 84,000 Calgarians. Nenshi approved a pilot project in 2011 for mobile food van servers. The project debuted during the first \\"YYC Taste the Trucks\\" an annual festival in 2011.

Taxes began to rise before Nenshi's government as both the provincial and city governments have increased taxes since 2007 for several years and Mayor Dave Bronconnier commissioned civic work projects, as Ctrain extension. Tax rates increased on average 5‚Äì10%/year for city taxes and 3‚Äì8%/year for provincial taxes.

Nenshi has encountered frustrations as his council finds it difficult to budget yearly with unsecured sources of provincial and federal funding. Nenshi with other Canadian mayors rebuked the Federal government for lack of capital funding for necessary projects such as transportation infrastructure projects such as public transit and improved highways as they have in the United States. The lack of fiscal clarification from the federal and provincial government has economically damaged the city causing debt and raised erratic municipal taxes as the city struggles to secure funding for projects to maintain the city. Dave Bronconnier faced similar challenges as Nenshi managing a growing city. Nenshi is tasked with completion of Bronconnier's necessary projects such as extension of the C-train. However, Nenshi together with Stephen Mandel attempted to negotiate with Premier Alison Redford to enact a charter to replace the decades-old ambiguous Municipal Act, to better define the roles of provincial and municipal governments.

It is semi-permanent staining that dulls the panel or fa√ßade's surface (in particular the edges of the panelling), reducing the natural lustre and shine produced by the anodizing processes used on the aluminium. Panel edge staining may also appear on powder coated aluminium, painted aluminium, stainless steel and titanium surfaces. Causes Panel edge staining is the by-product of the build-up of dirt and pollution. It is especially more noticeable on buildings using metallic fa√ßades in Asia, and regions close to the equator (such as Florida or South East Asia), as higher rates of air pollution, high levels of humidity and consistent rainfall encourage panel edge staining to develop. The unique top-to-bottom stain pattern of panel edge staining is caused when the build-up of dirt and pollution is washed from the higher panels to the lower panels of a surface by natural precipitation.

El Soplao (Cantabrian: El Soplau) is a cave located in the municipalities of Rionansa, Vald√°liga and Herrer√≠as in Cantabria, Spain. It is considered unique for the quality and quantity of geological formations (speleothems) in its 17 miles length, 6 of which are open to the public. In it are formations such as hel√≠ctites (eccentric stalactites defying gravity) and curtains (draperies, or sheets of calcite, sometimes translucent, hanging from the ceiling). Its formation dates back to the Mesozoic, in particular the Cretaceous period 240 million years ago. The entrance is at 540 metres in the Sierra Soplao Arnero. The cave was accidentally discovered during drilling for mining, subsequently being exploited for the extraction of minerals. During its operation, many local families were supported by the income they got from the mining, combined with farming livestock. After decades of neglect, speleology, and in particular the Cantabria University Speleology Club since 1975, have discovered its true geological value. On July 1, 2005 the Government of Cantabria opened it to the public and publicised it internationally, after development for tourism and protection rules prohibiting any further activity by the discoverering club. Research goes on, resulting in the study of amber deposits, the recognition of underground stromatolites formed by manganese-oxidising bacteria, and a new mineral form, zaccagnaite-3R. The cave recently started holding music concerts. Artists like Bert√≠n Osborne or Nando Ag√ºeros have played inside the cave for hundreds of people in 2016. El Soplao is just one of at least 6,500 caves in Cantabria. Situation Inside the cave of El Soplao. Access to the cave in Arnero Mountains, 540 metres above sea level. The cave is located in the Sierra de Arnero, part of the Sierra del Escudo de Cabu√©rniga, between the towns of Rionansa, Herrer√≠as and Vald√°liga and around San Vicente de la Barquera. The Sierra de Arnero runs parallel to the Cantabrian Sea, with a maximum altitude of 682 metres. To access the cave you can use the Cantabrian motorway.

In 1989, 50 songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine. Only \\"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\\" by Keith Whitley and \\"The Church on Cumberland Road\\" by Shenandoah, consecutive chart-toppers in April, spent more than a single week at number one. This was the final complete year in which Billboard used its longstanding methodology of compiling the chart based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. In January of the following year, the magazine would begin basing the chart on weekly airplay data from radio stations compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, which would lead to an increase in the length of time songs spent in the top spot. In November 1989, Billboard began compiling unpublished prototype charts using the new methodology ahead of the official launch, which produced very different results to the published charts using the existing process. Ronnie Milsap's \\"A Woman in Love\\" spent five weeks atop the prototype charts as opposed to the single week which it achieved on the published listing. It was the 35th and final number one of Milsap's career. Bands Alabama and Shenandoah, vocalists George Strait, Randy Travis and Rodney Crowell, and mother-daughter duo the Judds each reached number one with three different songs in 1989. As one of Shenandoah's songs spent a second week at number one, this meant that the band was the only act to spend four weeks in the top spot during the year. In June, Clint Black achieved his first number one with his debut single \\"A Better Man\\", which made him the first artist since Freddy Fender in 1975 to top the chart with his first charting release. Other artists to reach number one for the first time in 1989 were Holly Dunn, Patty Loveless, and Garth Brooks, who achieved the first chart-topper of his career with \\"If Tomorrow Never Comes\\". Brooks would go on to become one of the most successful artists in country music history, achieving unprecedented levels of album sales and selling out large stadiums in a manner previously associated only with rock stars.

In 1987, 50 different songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. At the start of the year, the song at the top of the charts was \\"Mind Your Own Business\\" by Hank Williams Jr.. The single had moved into the number one position in the issue of Billboard dated December 27, 1986 and remained in place for a second week in the issue dated January 3. The final number one of the year was \\"Somewhere Tonight\\" by Highway 101, which began a two-week run at the top in the issue dated December 26, 1987. Between those two chart-toppers, the only song to spend more than one week at number one was \\"Forever and Ever, Amen\\" by Randy Travis, which had a three-week run in the peak position during the summer. The song won both the Grammy Award for Best Country Song and the Academy of Country Music award for Song of the Year. Seven artists each achieved three number ones in 1987: Reba McEntire, Dan Seals, Earl Thomas Conley, George Strait, Steve Wariner, the Judds, and Ronnie Milsap, one of whose chart- toppers was a collaboration with Kenny Rogers. In addition to her three credited number ones, McEntire was also one of four featured vocalists on Hank Williams Jr's \\"Mind Your Own Business\\", none of whom were listed on the chart. Acts to reach number one for the first time included S-K-O and the O'Kanes, both of whom topped the chart for the first and only time in 1987. Michael Johnson had two number ones in the first half of the year, the first of which, \\"Give Me Wings\\", was named by Billboard as the top country single of the year. These would prove to be his only appearances at the top of the chart, however. At the other end of the scale, Milsap took his count of Hot Country number ones past 30, as he continued a run of ten number ones achieved between 1985 and 1989. Only Merle Haggard (38), Conway Twitty (40) and George Strait (44) have taken more songs to the top of the Hot Country chart than Milsap since Billboard began compiling sales and airplay into a single listing in 1958. Other veteran acts to appear at the top of the chart in 1987 included the Oak Ridge Boys, who achieved their fourteenth and fifteenth number ones, but their last to feature vocalist William Lee Golden, who was expelled from the group after more than 20 years during 1987. Crystal Gayle, one of the most successful chart acts of the preceding ten years, reached number one for the eighteenth and final time with \\"Straight to the Heart\\".

Hot Country Songs is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music songs in the United States, published by Billboard magazine. In 1985, 51 different songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. Only \\"Lost in the Fifties Tonight (In the Still of the Night)\\" by Ronnie Milsap managed a second week at the top of the chart. Alabama, one of the most successful bands in country music history, had the highest number of chart-toppers by a single act in 1985, with four: \\"(There's A) Fire in the Night\\", \\"There's No Way\\", \\"40 Hour Week (For a Livin')\\" and \\"Can't Keep a Good Man Down\\". When the group achieved its third number one of the year in August, Billboard regarded it as Alabama's seventeenth consecutive Hot Country number one, breaking the record for consecutive chart-toppers previously held by Sonny James. Alabama had released a Christmas single in late 1982 which only peaked at number 35, but the magazine disregarded this for the purposes of the band's number one streak, stating \\"only a Scrooge would count that against them\\". The band would eventually extend its streak of consecutive number ones to 21 before its popularity began to wane in the 1990s. Earl Thomas Conley, Exile, the Judds and the Oak Ridge Boys each had three number ones in 1985. Additionally Willie Nelson achieved one solo number one, one in collaboration with Ray Charles, and one as a member of the supergroup the Highwaymen, in which he was joined by Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson. Having appeared regularly on the Hot Country chart since 1976, Mel McDaniel achieved his first and only number one in 1985 with \\"Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On\\". Ray Charles also topped the chart for the only time in 1985. Although he was far more associated with the soul and rhythm and blues genres during his lengthy career, Charles placed several songs on the country chart during the mid-1980s. He went all the way to the top spot with the Willie Nelson collaboration \\"Seven Spanish Angels\\", taken from the album Friendship, on which Charles duetted with a range of contemporary country singers. Gary Morris and Sawyer Brown were also first- time chart-toppers in 1985, with \\"Baby Bye Bye\\" and \\"Step That Step\\" respectively. \\"Have Mercy\\" by The Judds was the final number one of the year.

In 1982, 48 different singles topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. The band Alabama achieved the most number ones by a single act, topping the chart four times. Ronnie Milsap, T. G. Sheppard, Ricky Skaggs and Conway Twitty each had three number ones. Alabama, Twitty and Willie Nelson tied for the most weeks in the top spot with four each. Nelson's four weeks consisted of two weeks with \\"Always on My Mind\\" followed immediately by a further two with \\"Just to Satisfy You\\", a collaboration with Waylon Jennings. In October, Dolly Parton topped the chart with the double A-sided single \\"I Will Always Love You\\" / \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\". Both tracks were re- recordings of songs she had previously released in the 1970s, and the original recording of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" had reached number one in 1974, making Parton the first artist to top the chart with two different recordings of the same song. Ed Bruce, best known for writing \\"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\\", a highly successful chart-topper for Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson four years earlier, achieved his only number one as a performer in 1982 with \\"You're the Best Break This Old Heart Ever Had\\". Several other artists reached the top spot for the first time in 1982, including Juice Newton with \\"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\\", Ricky Skaggs with \\"Crying My Heart Out Over You\\", Michael Murphey (later known as Michael Martin Murphy) with \\"What's Forever For\\", and John Anderson with \\"Wild and Blue\\". In August George Strait topped the chart for the first time with \\"Fool Hearted Memory\\"; Strait would go on to top the chart regularly for more than 25 years, achieving a record-breaking 44 Hot Country number ones.

Alabama, Razzy Bailey, T. G. Sheppard and Hank Williams Jr. tied for the most number ones of the year, with three chart-toppers each. As Alabama's \\"Feels So Right\\" was one of the few songs to spend a second week at number one, the band had the highest total number of weeks in the top spot, with four. Ten other acts achieved more than one number one in 1981. Several acts topped the chart for the first time in 1981: Charly McClain with \\"Who's Cheatin' Who\\", Sylvia with \\"Drifter\\", Rosanne Cash with \\"Seven Year Ache\\", Earl Thomas Conley with \\"Fire and Smoke\\", Ronnie McDowell with \\"Older Women\\", Steve Wariner with \\"All Roads Lead to You\\", and the duo of David Frizzell and Shelly West with \\"You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma\\". Shelly West's appearance at number one fell between two chart-toppers achieved in 1981 by her mother, Dottie West. \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" Elvis Presley, who had died in 1977, achieved a posthumous number one in March with the single \\"Guitar Man\\". Upon its original release in 1967, the song had been a minor hit on Billboard all-genres chart, the Hot 100. More than three years after his death, however, the song was re-released to promote a similarly-titled album which combined existing Presley vocals with new instrumental backing tracks created in Nashville by producer Felton Jarvis, and this time became a country number one. Two songs which topped the country chart consecutively in January also topped the Hot 100, albeit several weeks later. Eddie Rabbitt's \\"I Love a Rainy Night\\" topped the country chart in the issue of Billboard dated January 10, and was replaced the following week by Dolly Parton's \\"9 to 5\\". On the Hot 100, Parton's song reached the top in the issue dated February 21, was replaced by Rabbitt's song the following week, but then returned to the top spot in the issue dated March 14. The two songs were among just four country songs which topped the Hot 100 during the 1980s, and the only two to do so consecutively. Both songs, along with \\"I Don't Need You\\" by Kenny Rogers, also crossed over to adult contemporary radio with sufficient impact to top Billboards Adult Contemporary airplay chart, reflecting increasing pop and soft rock influences on mainstream country music.

In 1979, 33 different singles topped the chart, which was published at the time under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine. Chart placings were based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. Waylon Jennings, Anne Murray, Kenny Rogers, and Conway Twitty tied for the highest total number of weeks spent at number one in 1979, each spending five weeks at the top of the chart. Jennings, Murray and Twitty each had a run of three consecutive weeks at number one with \\"Amanda\\", \\"I Just Fall in Love Again\\" and \\"Happy Birthday Darlin'\\" respectively. The three songs tied for the longest unbroken run in the top spot during 1979 with \\"Every Which Way but Loose\\" by Eddie Rabbitt, \\"Golden Tears\\" by Dave & Sugar and \\"If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me\\" by the Bellamy Brothers, each of which also spent three weeks atop the listing. Murray, Rogers and Twitty each had three number ones in 1979, the most by an individual act. In January, John Conlee achieved the first of seven number one country singles with \\"Lady Lay Down\\"; he would reach number one for the second time in May. Two weeks after Conlee's second number one, the Bellamy Brothers topped the chart for the first time. The brother duo had topped Billboards all-genres singles chart, the Hot 100, three years earlier with \\"Let Your Love Flow\\", but had not previously topped the country listing until the 1979 success of \\"If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me\\". In August, the Charlie Daniels Band reached number one for the first and only time with \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\". The following month Leon Russell made his first appearance at the top of the country chart when he collaborated with Willie Nelson on a cover version of Elvis Presley's 1950s song \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\".

It was released in November 1994 on the Melbourne independent label Au Go Go Records. The EP originally peaked at number 71 on the Australian singles chart, selling over 20,000 copies. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, the EP was nominated for four awards; Best New Talent, Best Independent Release, Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single and Best Alternative Release. In 2020, the EP was re-released on CD and vinyl and it entered the Australian albums chart at number 26. Background and release After the release of their debut Signs of Satanic Youth in 1993, and a heady succession of touring with the likes of Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins, Beck and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Magic Dirt weathered the hysteria of 'the next big thing' tag and a storm of major label interest by breaking up and getting back together four times. After regrouping for good and hiring help in the way of management and an agent, Magic Dirt reconvened in the middle of 1994 to record Life Was Better. The cover art for Life Was Better was heavily influenced by Aussie cult movie Puberty Blues, with which the band were obsessed. Follow its release, the band featured heavily on alternative press and garnered the band a national spot on the Big Day Out, supported Hole, Silverchair and Dinosaur Jr throughout 1995. Late in 1995, they signed a record deal in the USA. Reception In November 1994, OTS said \\"Geelong's favourite sons (and daughter) do it again, with five tracks of pure alterno magic... this is a guaranteed indie hit and one of the archetypal Australian releases of the year.\\" In December 1994, D.D. Forte called the EP \\"the kind of feedback-laced gutter pop to knock the loneliness out of your head\\". In January 1995, Tracey Grimson from OTS said \\"It's clear that Magic Dirt take their lessons from a combination of the punk of new indie mixed with the roots of older alternative rock... What rises up is hard, heavy, contagious rock 'n' roll ‚Äì a new breed.\\" In December 1995, Nazz from Rip It Up said \\"It sounds like something sweet, like The Bangles... as covered by an air conditioner and a cement mixer\\". In 2020, Jeff Jenkins from Stack Magazine said Life Was Better \\"...shows a band that should have conquered the world.

It is based on the idea that the permutation to be sorted can be factored into cycles, which can individually be rotated to give a sorted result. Unlike nearly every other sort, items are never written elsewhere in the array simply to push them out of the way of the action. Each value is either written zero times, if it's already in its correct position, or written one time to its correct position. This matches the minimal number of overwrites required for a completed in- place sort. Minimizing the number of writes is useful when making writes to some huge data set is very expensive, such as with EEPROMs like Flash memory where each write reduces the lifespan of the memory.  Algorithm  To illustrate the idea of cycle sort, consider a list with distinct elements. Given an element , we can find the index at which it will occur in the sorted list by simply counting the number of elements in the entire list that are smaller than . Now # If the element is already at the correct position, do nothing. # If it is not, we will write it to its intended position. That position is inhabited by a different element , which we then have to move to its correct position. This process of displacing elements to their correct positions continues until an element is moved to the original position of . This completes a cycle. Displacement cycle for list \\"bdeac\\", when shifting the first letter b to its correct position: Repeating this process for every element sorts the list, with a single writing operation if and only if an element is not already at its correct position. While computing the correct positions takes O(n) time for every single element, thus resulting in a quadratic time algorithm, the number of writing operations is minimized. = Implementation = To create a working implementation from the above outline, two issues need to be addressed: # When computing the correct positions, we have to make sure not to double-count the first element of the cycle. # If there are duplicate elements present, we could try to move an element to its correct position, which already happens to be inhabited by an . Simply swapping these would cause the algorithm to cycle indefinitely. Instead, we have to insert the element after any of its duplicates. The following Python implementation:sr:Cikliƒçno sortiranje#Algoritam performs cycle sort on an array, counting the number of writes to that array that were needed to sort it. def cycle_sort(array) -> int: \\"\\"\\"Sort an array in place and return the number of writes.\\"\\"\\" writes = 0 # Loop through the array to find cycles to rotate. for cycle_start in range(0, len(array) - 1): item = array[cycle_start] # Find where to put the item. pos = cycle_start for i in range(cycle_start + 1, len(array)): if array[i] < item: pos += 1 # If the item is already there, this is not a cycle. if pos  cycle_start: continue # Otherwise, put the item there or right after any duplicates. while item  array[pos]: pos += 1 array[pos], item = item, array[pos] writes += 1 # Rotate the rest of the cycle. while pos != cycle_start: # Find where to put the item. pos = cycle_start for i in range(cycle_start + 1, len(array)): if array[i] < item: pos += 1 # Put the item there or right after any duplicates. while item  array[pos]: pos += 1 array[pos], item = item, array[pos] writes += 1 return writes  Situation-specific optimizations  When the array contains only duplicates of a relatively small number of items, a constant-time perfect hash function can greatly speed up finding where to put an item, turning the sort from Œò(n2) time to Œò(n + k) time, where k is the total number of hashes. The array ends up sorted in the order of the hashes, so choosing a hash function that gives you the right ordering is important. Before the sort, create a histogram, sorted by hash, counting the number of occurrences of each hash in the array. Then create a table with the cumulative sum of each entry in the histogram. The cumulative sum table will then contain the position in the array of each element. The proper place of elements can then be found by a constant-time hashing and cumulative sum table lookup rather than a linear search.

A Royal Navy sloop-of-war encountered eight pirate ships near Nam Quan and defeated them in a decisive action with help from armed Chinese civilians on land.Wombwell, pg. 111 Background For years the United Kingdom, the Qing dynasty, the United States and the Portuguese of Macao operated against the pirates of southwestern China. It took decades to finally clear the South China Sea of pirate junks. The largest problem was that the western and Chinese navies did not have the naval strength to combat the pirates. However, operations continued despite the weakness and several significant battles were fought. Usually the sailors of the navies were heavily out-numbered, but they were not out-gunned by the pirates, and so this did not prevent them from hunting and engaging the brigands wherever found. The RN's biggest problem was finding them.Wombwell, pg. 111 Battle , of 12 guns, was one of the Royal Navy vessels assigned to counter piracy. In the early 1850s she participated in several actions with pirates. On 10 May 1853 Rattler found pirates off Nam Quan, which is near the present day border with Vietnam. Just days before, the pirates had captured a convoy of merchant ships. The pirates were holding the vessels off Nam Quan and demanding that a ransom be paid for their release. When Rattler approached she opened fire at long range on the pirate flagship. The pirate flagship returned fire but was quickly sunk. Rattler then engaged a second junk and sank her too with gunfire before moving on to capture a third which was burned and then sunk.Wombwell, pg. 111 HMS Alecto in 1845. Disheartened, the remaining pirate ships broke off the action and were beached by their crews. At least half of the 1,000 pirates escaped to shore but most of them were attacked by Chinese militia and killed. One group, after their ship was grounded, took over a merchant junk, killed its crew, and began to flee. The British sent their cutter after it but when it closed in on the junk, the pirates opened fire and repulsed the attack. Three Britons, one officer and two enlisted men, were killed. Out of over 1,000 pirates, 500 were estimated to have been killed or wounded; the British took no prisoners. The British took and refloated all four of the beached junks and the one lorcha. Eighty-four cannons were also taken along with the remaining merchant ships; one captured junk escaped.Wombwell, pg. 111 See also *Battle of Fatshan Creek *First and Second Opium Wars Notes References * Nam Quan Nam Quan 1853 in China China‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations Nam Quan 19th-century history of the Royal Navy ","title":"Battle of Nam Quan"},{"id":"29050669","text":"is a railway station on the Nipp≈ç Main Line operated by Ky≈´sh≈´ Railway Company in Usa, ≈åita, Japan.
