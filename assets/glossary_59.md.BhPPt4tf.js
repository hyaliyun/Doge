Incorporated in 1965, ACDI/VOCA‚Äôs mission is to promote economic opportunities for cooperatives, enterprises and communities through the innovative application of sound business practice. ACDI/VOCA has worked in 148 countries since 1963. Total revenues for ACDI/VOCA and its affiliates are approximately $154 million. ACDI/VOCA employs approximately 1,270 people in the USA and overseas.  History   Agricultural Cooperative Development International  ACDI (Agricultural Cooperative Development International) was formed in 1966 by major U.S. farm cooperatives. Its principal objective was to provide expertise and support to cooperative enterprises in developing countries. In 1967, ACDI helped found Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative (IFFCO), India's largest fertilizer company, re-established cooperative banking in Poland, and set up large business-oriented farmer organizations in East Africa, including the cooperative unions in Sidama and Yirgachefe, Ethiopia, that enabled direct export of coffee from those regions. IFFCO is still a member of ACDI.  Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance  VOCA (Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance) was established in 1970 to provide volunteer assistance in developing countries. In 1985 VOCA was the first implementer of the USAID-funded Farmer-to-Farmer program. Volunteers have included bank presidents, coffee roasters, grain storage specialists and business magnates. After the fall of the Soviet Union, a substantial number of assignments were carried out in Central and Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States, in many cases providing entrepreneurs there with exposure to the dynamics of the private sector and modern commercial operations. In 1997 the two organizations merged to form ACDI/VOCA. The merger combined ACDI‚Äôs long-term development approaches and VOCA‚Äôs people-to-people volunteer activities. Formerly the acronym stood for the combination of the two entities (Agricultural Cooperative Development International/Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance), but today its legal name is solely the acronym. The organization‚Äôs programming currently revolves around value chain approaches to enterprise development, self-sustaining financial services development, farmer organization, agribusiness development, self-help community development, and food aid, among other competencies. The organization sends hundreds of U.S. volunteer experts overseas each year on short-term assignments.  Focus areas  ACDI/VOCA works in five main areas: * Catalyzing investment * Climate-smart agriculture * Empowerment & resilience * Institutional strengthening * Market systems  Funding  ACDI/VOCA receives funding from various donors, including United States Agency for International Development, United States Department of Agriculture, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Department of International Development (DFID), United States African Development Foundation (USADF), the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, African Union Commission (AU), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and other development funders.

It is situated on the southern shore of the island of Florelandet, adjacent to the town center. Owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor, it features a runway aligned 07/25. The airport had 201,686 passengers in 2014, making it the busiest regional airport in the country. The airport is served by Wider√∏e with flights to Oslo, Bergen, Kristiansund and Stavanger. CHC Helikopter Service flies to the North Sea oil platforms at Snorre, Visund, Gj√∏a and Knarr. The Royal Norwegian Air Force's 330 Squadron operates a Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopter out of Flor√∏. Construction of an airport first commenced in 1956, but was terminated. Flor√∏ Airport opened as part of a network of four regional airports on 1 July 1971. Wider√∏e served it with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters, later also de Havilland Canada Dash 7s. The heliport opened in 1994 and the runway was extended from the original in 2000. That year Coast Air took over the routes from Wider√∏e. Danish Air Transport resumed them in 2003 until Wider√∏e again won back the operations in 2012. The search and rescue base opened in 2009. There are proposals to extend the runway further. History Norwegian Air Lines commenced services along the West Coast of the Norway in 1935. These would call at Flor√∏ on demand, landing at the docks at Florevika. The seaplane routes required a boat to ferry out to the aircraft to embark and disembark passengers. From 1951 to 1959 Flor√∏ Radio operated an aeradio at Rognaldsv√•g to assist air navigation along the coast. Large-scale construction of airports in Norway started in the 1950s, largely funded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Bergen Airport, Flesland opened in 1955, followed by √Ölesund Airport, Vigra in 1958. The first plans for an airport in Sunnfjord were launched by Engineer Arne Bengtsen, who proposed building an airfield in Flor√∏ and having West Norway Airlines operate to it using the Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer. This was backed by the municipalities of Kinn and Flor√∏, who considered the possibilities of an runway to be located at Havreneset. It would be designed as a combined land and water aerodrome, where seaplanes would feed to other locations in Sogn og Fjordane. These would land at Gunhildv√•gen. The proposal was approved by a government commission in 1956. Construction of a runway commenced in late 1956, with plans for later extension to . However, it soon became evident that the Twin Pioneer would not receive operating permit for winter operations. Construction of the airport was therefore scrapped. Part of the runway was used to build a street, Industrivegen. A government commission, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle was about to the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners,Svanberg: 662‚Äì663 including an airport in Flor√∏. Wider√∏e launched an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. H√•kon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population. The regional airports only received a simple terminal and an runway. The first such airports were opened in Helgeland in 1968. This was deeded sufficiently successful that Parliament approved the second stage in 1969, consisting of four airports in Northwestern Norway. In addition to Flor√∏, these consisted of F√∏rde Airport, √òyrane; Sogndal Airport, Hauk√•sen; and √òrsta‚ÄìVolda Airport, Hovden. Flor√∏ Airport received a runway measuring and an apron measuring .Arnesen: 117 All four airports opened on 1 July 1971. The government issued the task of operating the routes to Wider√∏e, who initially served it with its 19-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. Services commenced to Bergen Airport, Flesland and √Ölesund Airport, Vigra, as well as between the STOLports. Wider√∏e built its main base for Southern Norway at Flor√∏ Airport, consisting of a hangar and manned with six mechanics.Arnesen: 119 Wider√∏e introduced the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 on the route from Flor√∏ and Sogndal to Oslo Airport, Fornebu in September 1983.Arnesen: 138 Wider√∏e replaced its Twin Otters and Dash 7s with the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 in the early 1990s. The terminal building With the opening of the Snorre Oil Field in the North Sea, Flor√∏ Airport was selected as the heliport to fly out to the platforms. Saga Petroleum selected Helikopter Service as their operator, with the helibase opening in 1994. The increased traffic led to the extension of the runway to in 2000. From 1997 the flights were made subject to public service obligations. Wider√∏e won the first three-year contract. In the second contest in September 1999, Coast Air won the Flor√∏ contract. It introduced their two 46-seat ATR 42‚Äì300 aircraft. This caused Wider√∏e to have to move their base from Flor√∏ to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The company received NOK 51 million annually, from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2003. The bid was about NOK 100 million lower than from Wider√∏e. All stopovers were thereby dropped. Coast Air flew four or five daily trips to both Bergen and Oslo. The demand for air travel dropped in 2001, and only 85,000 passengers flew with Coast Air to Flor√∏, instead of the estimated 100,000, making the entire operation a loss for the company. With the next round of PSO contracts, valid from 1 April 2003 through 31 March 2006, Coast Air lost the Flor√∏ contract to Danish Air Transport. The airline kept the contract for nine years. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Following a competition with √Ölesund to receive a new search and rescue base, the government selected Flor√∏ as the sixth detachment of the Royal Norwegian Air Force's 330 Squadron. The base became operational in September 2009 after investments of 70 million Norwegian krone. The following year GDF Suez started operations on its Gj√∏a Oil Field and CHC Helikopter Service expanded its base. Wider√∏e was able to reclaim the Flor√∏ contract in the 2012 tender, after they bid to operate the route without subsidies. Wider√∏e thereafter moved its technical base back to Flor√∏. Danish Air Transport commenced a route from Flor√∏ to Stavanger Airport, Sola in 2012, but closed it down within months. It was followed up by Airwing, which commenced flights the following year, first to Stavanger and subsequently to Notodden Airport, Tuven. Facilities Flor√∏ Airport is situated on a southern peninsula of the Florelandet, the island on which Flor√∏ is situated. The asphalt runway has physical dimensions and is aligned 07/25. It has a takeoff run available (TORA) and a landing distance available (LDA) of . The airport is equipped with category 4 fire and rescue service. The airport is situated five minutes drive from the town center. There is an hourly bus service operated by Firda Billag. Paid parking, taxis and car rental are available at the airport. Airlines and destinations Most scheduled services out of Flor√∏ are provided by Wider√∏e using the de Havilland Canada Dash 8. These are operated as public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications, although Wider√∏e has since 2012 been operating them on a null-bid. Wider√∏e operates five daily flights daily to Oslo and Bergen, and daily to Kristiansund and Stavanger. Airwing operates daily flights to Stavanger and Notodden using a Beech King Air. CHC Helikopter Service operates helicopter flights to three oil platforms in the North Sea. Flor√∏ Airport served 200,356 passengers, 11,654 aircraft movements and handled 3 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Flor√∏ Airport is also the base of a detachment of a Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopter of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Medical staff is provided by F√∏rde Hospital Trust. The detachment carried out 149 missions lasting 476 hours in 2013. Future Avinor is considering steps to expand the airport. It still has the inaugural terminal from 1971, which is in need of expansion. Additional apron space is also needed, as is car parking. Further extension of the runway is also being considered, either to . Either way the extension would be westwards. The sounds of Ausa and Furesundet would have to be filled and the two islands as well as Fur√∏ya leveled. Avinor has estimated the costs at about 200 million kroner. Avinor has started a process to look at the airport structure in Sogn og Fjordane. Early plans have looked at closing down F√∏rde Airport, Bringeland, and possibly also Sandane Airport, Anda, while expanding the runway at Flor√∏ Airport to .Br√•then: 64 This would allow for jetliners to operate from Flor√∏ to Oslo with significantly lower ticket prices and remove the need for subsidies.Br√•then: 65 Previously, the Ministry of Transport and Communications has proposed closing Sandane Airport and splitting the traffic between F√∏rde and √òrsta-Volda Airport, Hovden.

Schat studied composition with Kees van Baaren at the Utrecht Conservatoire and the Royal Conservatory of The Hague from 1952 until 1958, and then went on to study in London with M√°ty√°s Seiber in 1959 and with Pierre Boulez in Basle in 1960‚Äì61. His early training with van Baaren and Seiber disposed him toward twelve-tone technique, and his earliest compositions, such as the Introductie en adagio in oude stijl (1954) and the Septet (1957), combine traditional forms with dodecaphony. Boulez, however, led him to a more radical, strict form of serialism, and he was regarded in the Netherlands as one of the outstanding representatives of the avant garde . While still a student he created his opus 1, Passacaglia and Fugue for organ (1954), and Septet (1957). In 1957 he also won the Gaudeamus International Composers Award. In the late sixties Schat became associated with the Provo (movement); their publications were printed in his cellar (; ) He was involved in the notorious 1969 \\"notenkrakersactie\\" (Nutcracker Action) in which a group of activists interrupted a concert by the Concertgebouw Orchestra, demanding an open discussion of music policy . That same year, Schat contributed, together with the composers Reinbert de Leeuw, Louis Andriessen, Jan van Vlijmen, and Misha Mengelberg, and the writers Harry Mulisch and Hugo Claus, in Reconstructie, a sort of opera, or \\"morality\\" theatre work, about the conflict between American imperialism and liberation . In February 1969 he co-founded the Studio for Electro-Instrumental Music (STEIM) in Amsterdam. Among his most widely noted works are Thema (from 1970) and To You (from 1972). To You was performed at the Holland Festival. The 1970s also brought Schat's most distinctive contribution to 20th-century music theory, the \\"tone clock\\". It lends its name to a translation of his collected essays, The Tone Clock (Contemporary Music Studies) (1993, ). Schat died in 2003 from cancer.

Although one of the lesser-known groups of the Bay Area thrash metal scene, each album in their career has received high critical marks. One of their signature elements was Ibanez guitars adorned with elaborate airbrushed scenes of warfare. History Early years and split (1982-1992) L»ß»ßz Rockit was formed in the hills of Berkeley, California by vocalist Michael Coons and guitarist Aaron Jellum. Coons was 17, just about to graduate high school, and Jellum was 18, busy attending college and riding motorcycles, and they knew what musical direction they wanted to pursue. After performing with various members, Coons and Jellum came across guitarist Phil Kettner and drummer Victor Agnello in late 1982 and early 1983. Bassist Willy Lange joined soon after in 1983 to complete the line-up of the band. Their first recording was the Prelude to Death demo, which was released that year. They later signed with Target Records to release their debut album City's Gonna Burn in 1984, followed by No Stranger to Danger in 1985. This period saw L»ß»ßz Rockit play with a wide variety of bands, such as the \\"big four\\" (Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax), Exodus, Ratt, W.A.S.P., Girlschool, Y&T;, Leatherwolf, Kix, Dark Angel, Suicidal Tendencies, Stryper and Armored Saint, and they made their first appearances in Europe in 1986, supporting Mot√∂rhead. Their presence helped forge a new, heavier musical direction for the band and formed a unique relationship with European fans. L»ß»ßz Rockit released the next two albums, Know Your Enemy in 1987 and Annihilation Principle in 1989, under their new label Roadrunner Records/Enigma Records, with both albums being well received by fans and critics, and seeing them share the stage with the likes of Metallica, Megadeth, Exodus, Anthrax, Overkill, Testament, M.O.D., Celtic Frost, Kreator, Voivod, Nuclear Assault, Vio-lence, Forbidden, Metal Church, D.B.C., Suicidal Tendencies, the Cro-Mags, Faith No More and L.A. Guns. Later in 1989, Lange, Kettner and Agnello left the band for various reasons, leaving Coons and Jellum as the only remaining members left. The two soon recruited guitarist Scott Sargeant, bassist Scott Dominguez and drummer Dave Chavarri. In 1991, the album Nothing's Sacred was released. After touring in the United States and Europe from 1991 to 1992, and making an appearance in Japan in 1992, the band split-up. Most of the members then formed the short-lived groove-oriented thrash metal band Gack, Replacing Chavarri with Defiance drummer Matt Vander Ende. Reunion (2005-present) In 2005, L»ß»ßz Rockit reformed with the original line-up, performing their return show at the Dynamo Open Air in May 2005. On July 9, 2005, they teamed up with other bands to perform in San Francisco for the benefit concert dubbed Thrash Against Cancer. In September 2005, the band made their return to Japan. Later, L»ß»ßz Rockit announced that they would not record a new album. However, following the response to their shows in April 2007 and the sales of their Live Untold DVD, released in 2006, they announced that they would undertake a project that was intended to result in a new album for release in 2007 or early 2008. In 2007, new drummer Sky Harris joined the band. On May 27, 2008, L»ß»ßz Rockit posted two new songs from their then-upcoming release Left for Dead on their official Myspace page. The album was released on July 25, 2008 on the German label Massacre Records. They also announced that their back catalogue would be re-released and remastered, however Nothing's Sacred was not mentioned for a re-release. On December 9, 2011, the band opened for Metallica on the third concert of their 30th anniversary party at The Fillmore. On June 1, 2014, drummer Victor Agnello died at the age of 50 after battling Leukemia for over a year. On October 23, 2018, bassist Willy Lange died at the age of 57 from injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. The current status of the band is unknown. Although a break-up or hiatus had not been announced, they have been inactive since opening for Metallica in 2011. In addition to confusion of their current status, their official website had ceased to exist by March 2017. Despite this, there had been reports of the band writing a follow-up to 2008's Left for Dead.

Karnaprayag is one of the Panch Prayag (five confluences) of Alaknanda River, situated at the confluence of the Alaknanda and Pindar River. Demographics As of the 2001 census, Karnaprayag had a population of 6976. Males constitute 56% of the population, and females make up 44%. Karnaprayag has an average literacy rate of 76%, higher than the national average of 59.5%. Male literacy is 81%, and female literacy is 69%. 13% of the population is under six years of age. Geography Karnaprayag is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Karnaprayag It has an average elevation of 1,451 metres (4,760 feet). The confluence of the Pindar River, which arises from the icy Pindari glacier and the Alaknanda, occurs at Karnaprayag. Nanda Devi, towering above at 7,816 m (25,634 ft.), and surrounded by an array of glittering peaks, Trisul, Drona Giri, Nanda Ghunti, Mrigathuni, and Maiktoli. Overview Karnaprayag is one of five sites where the confluence of rivers occurs. The five prayags are Vishnuprayag, Nandprayag, Karnaprayag, Rudraprayag, and Devprayag. Allahabad(Prayagraj), where the Ganges, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati join, is known as Prayag and is one of the holy places of Hindu pilgrimage. Karnaprayag is believed by many to be the place where Karna of the Mahabharata, was to have worshipped the Sun God. There is an ancient temple devoted to Uma in Karnaprayag. In some versions, Karnaprayag is the place where Lord Krishna did the cremation of Karna. When Arjuna used the Anjalika astra on weaponless Karna, who was still trying to lift the sunken chariot wheel, Lord Krishna found that Karna was still alive even though seriously wounded. Lord Krishna found that Dharma- devata, the goddess responsible for protecting Dharma (righteousness), is guarding Karna against death and resisting every arrow sent by Arjuna. Krishna and Arjuna found it was impossible to kill Karna as the goddess was protecting Karna personally. Lord Krishna explained to Arjuna that the Dharma-devata herself was protecting Karna from death because of the massive good merit Karna earned by giving charity during his lifetime and it was impossible even for Lord Shiva to kill Karna. Krishna said wherever Dharma is present, there is victory, and this time Dharma was with the side of Karna. So Krishna went down from his chariot and appeared as a Brahmin and asked for Karna's punya or merit to him as charity. Karna gave his entire merits as charity to the Brahmin in the form of his blood, and once Karna gifted his life's merit to him, Krishna rewarded Karna with the view of Krishna's Vishwaroopa. Krishna told that only this way it was possible to kill Karna and when Karna gave away his life's merit to Krishna, Dharma-devata disappeared. Karna asked Krishna to cremate him in a virgin land where nobody else is present. Then Krishna went back to his chariot and asked Arjuna to take the kill shot on Karna. Later Krishna himself done the cremation of Karna at Karnaprayag. It is on the way to Badrinath, on the confluence of two holy rivers Alaknanda and Pindar. It is said that Karna of Mahabharata meditated here for many years to acquire the impregnable shield, which made him a formidable warrior in the battlefield. Swami Vivekananda meditated here for eighteen days with his Guru Bhai, Guru Turianand ji and Akharanand ji. It is the sub-divisional headquarters of district Chamoli. Roads from here go to Almora, Nainital, and Jim Corbett National Park. How to reach Air The nearest airport is the Jolly Grant Airport near Dehradun away.. Railway The nearest railway station is at Rishikesh. However, Rishikesh is a small railway station not connected by fast trains. Haridwar railway junction, 24 km farther from Rishikesh, has train connections to most of the major cities in India and is, therefore, the railhead for Karnaprayag. Road Karnaprayag lies on national highway NH58 that connects Delhi with Badrinath and Mana Pass in Uttarakhand near Indo- Tibet border. Therefore all the buses and vehicles that carry pilgrims from New Delhi to Badrinath via Haridwar and Rishikesh in pilgrim season of summer months pass through Karnaprayag on the way to Joshimath and further north. Rishikesh is the major starting point for the road journey to Karnaprayag, and regular buses operate from Rishikesh bus station to Karnaprayag. The road distance from Rishikesh to Karnaprayag is via Rudraprayag and Srinagar (Uttarakhand). * Haridwar to Rishikesh 24 km * Rishikesh to Devprayag 74 km * Devprayag to Srinagar 34 km * Srinagar to Rudraprayag 33 km * Rudraprayag to Karnaprayag 31 km  Gallery  Image:Karnprayag.jpgThe Alaknanda (from right) is joined by Pindar river (from bottom) at Karnaprayag at a height of 788 m (2,600 ft.)

They are best remembered for their only Hot 100 chart appearance with the song \\"Day After Day (It's Slippin' Away)\\". Band history The band debuted as Renaissance in 1968, with a one-shot single \\"The Hi-Way Song\\" on GNP Crescendo, which did not chart. Shortly thereafter, they changed their name to Shango. The full line-up consisted of Tommy Reynolds (keyboards, percussion; later of Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds), Richie Hernandez (guitar), Malcolm Evans (bass), and Joe Earle (drums, listed on the cover of the A&M; album as Joe Barile). Hernandez and Evans handled most of the vocals. Shango's best- known recording was their debut single, a 1969 Caribbean-flavored novelty hit called \\"Day After Day (It's Slippin' Away)\\" from their self-titled album Shango on A&M.; Produced by Jerry Riopelle and co-written by Riopelle, Stuart Margolin and Reynolds, it mocked contemporary doomsday predictions that California was destined to be destroyed (presumably very soon) by an earthquake. The track reached #57 on the Billboard charts in the US. It was actually a bigger hit in Canada, where it sneaked into the top 40, peaking at #39 on the Canadian RPM charts. Subsequent A&M; singles were flops. Shango was dropped by A&M; after their first album, but picked up by ABC/Dunhill, and assigned to producer Steve Barri. They recorded an album for ABC/Dunhill; the album's lead (and only) single \\"Some Things A Man's Gotta Do\\" hit #107 on Billboard in July, 1970. The song also peaked at number 70 in Australia. Shango dissolved shortly thereafter, with Reynolds moving almost immediately to Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds.

Compression stockings are elastic compression garments worn around the leg, compressing the limb. This reduces the diameter of distended veins and increases venous blood flow velocity and valve effectiveness. Compression therapy helps decrease venous pressure, prevents venous stasis and impairments of venous walls, and relieves heavy and aching legs. Knee-high compression stockings are used not only to help increase circulation, but also to help prevent the formation of blood clots in the lower legs. They also aid in the treatment of ulcers of the lower legs. Unlike traditional dress or athletic stockings and socks, compression stockings use stronger elastics to create significant pressure on the legs, ankles and feet. Compression stockings are tightest at the ankles and gradually become less constrictive toward the knees and thighs. By compressing the surface veins, arteries and muscles, they force circulating blood through narrower channels. As a result, the arterial pressure is increased, which causes more blood to return to the heart and less blood to pool in the feet. There are two types of compression stockings, gradient and anti-embolism. Compression stockings Medical uses Treatment is usually prescribed by a physician to relieve all manifestations of chronic venous disease and prevent venous troubles. Compression stockings are recommended under the following conditions: Edema Edema is a condition where the opposing forces that occur in the small blood vessels and capillaries cause a net ultrafiltration of plasma water into the soft tissues. Chronic venous insufficiency Chronic peripheral venous insufficiency is when the veins cannot pump deoxygenated blood back to the heart. Varicose veins Varicose Veins Varicose veins are saccular and distended veins which can expand considerably and may cause painful venous inflammation. Once developed, they will not disappear on their own. The formation of varicose veins is an externally visible sign of venous weakness. Deep vein thrombosis Deep vein thrombosis occurs when blood flow decreases (especially in the lower extremities), causing blood to pool in the legs and leading to blood clot (thrombus) formation. Evidence does not suggest a benefit in post thrombotic syndrome rates following DVT. Compression stockings are beneficial in reducing symptomless deep vein thrombosis among airline passengers flying for 7 hours or more. Pharmacological (warfarin, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin) and mechanical measures (graded compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression devices, and venous foot pumps) are used to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in clinical practice. For cases in which the bleeding risk is high and pharmacologic measures are contraindicated, the use of mechanical prophylaxis is recommended. Graduated compression stockings can effectively prevent VTE in hospitalized patients by applying different pressure to the leg. The meta-analysis of general surgical patients revealed that graduated compression stockings decreased their risk of developing VTE by 68% compared to placebo. Twenty randomized controlled trials analyzed the effectiveness of graduated compression stockings alone or with other additional prophylaxis in prevention of deep vein thrombosis. These trials included 1,681 patients after general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and medical patients. They concluded that graduated compression stockings are effective in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in patients who have undergone general and orthopaedic surgery. Combining graduated compression stockings with other mechanical and pharmacological measures can increase the effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis by 60%. However, another study performed in France involved 407 ICU patients and showed no difference in the effectiveness of the VTE prevention for patients who used compression stockings alone or in combination with intermittent pneumatic devices. Lymphedema Lymphedema occurs when a body part swells due to an abnormal accumulation of lymph fluid, occurring when there is interference with the normal drainage of lymph fluid back into the blood, commonly swelling the arm, leg, neck or abdomen. Phlebitis Phlebitis is the term used when inflammation and clotting occurs in a vein, most often a leg vein, due to infection, inflammation, or trauma. People with varicose veins are more often affected. Inflammation occurs suddenly, causing the thrombus to adhere firmly to the vein wall and risking clogging a superficial vein. Lipodermatosclerosis Lipodermatosclerosis is the term used to refer to the inflammation of subcutaneous fat, a form of panniculitis. Pregnancy Hormones released during pregnancy and the expanding uterus (pressure on the inferior vena cava ‚Äì the major vein returning blood up to the heart) can affect leg veins. The use of elastic compression stockings can reduce volumetric variations during standing hours. The use of stockings for the entire day is more effective than just half the day or not using compression stockings at all. Many physicians and vein specialists recommend wearing compression stockings after varicose vein stripping, but studies show that wearing an elastic compression stocking has no additional benefit after the application of elastic bandaging for three days in post-operative care following the stripping of the great saphenous vein as assessed by control of limb, edema, pain, complications and return to work. Contraindications Compression stockings Caution should be used in those with advanced peripheral obstructive arterial disease, heart failure, septic phlebitis, oozing dermatitis and advanced peripheral neuropathy in regard to wearing compression stockings. Procedure In the clinical setting the applying of the antiembolism stockings is performed by physicians, nurses and other trained personnel. First the proper size stocking is determined by measuring the legs. Aseptic technique is not necessary unless the skin is open. The person is placed in the supine position in bed for fifteen minutes prior to measuring for fit. This allows for venous return and stability before measuring. Stockings are best applied upon waking before the person has arisen from bed, has been sitting or standing and before venous stasis or edema has had a chance to develop. Fit is critical to the therapeutic effect of compression stockings. A study listed in the American Journal of Nursing in August 2008 showed that compression stockings were incorrectly sized in just under 30% of the cases studied. It found that additional education was needed not only for patients, but also for medical staff.  Gradient  These stockings are designed to remedy impaired \\"musculovenous pump\\" performance caused by incompetent leg vein valves. They are woven in such a way that the compression level is highest around the ankle and lessens towards the top of the hose. Doctors will typically recommend these stockings for those who are prone to blood clots, lower limb edema, and blood pooling in the legs and feet from prolonged periods of sitting or inactivity. They are also frequently used to address complications caused by diabetes, lymphedema, thrombosis, cellulitis, and other conditions. They are worn by those who are ambulatory in most cases, helping calf muscles to perform their pumping action more efficiently to return blood to the heart. In some cases, they are worn by those at increased risk of circulatory problems, such as diabetics, whose legs are prone to excessive swelling. A common indicator for the prescription of such stockings is chronic peripheral venous insufficiency, caused by incompetent perforator veins. Low-pressure compression stockings are available without prescription in most countries, and may be purchased at a pharmacy or medical supply store. Stockings with a higher pressure gradient, say, above 25‚Äì30 mmHg, may require a prescription from a doctor. There are several crucial cautionary steps that need to be taken before using compression stockings: # A patient's ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) must be >1.0 per leg to wear compression stockings, otherwise the stockings may obstruct the patient's arterial flow. The ABI indicates how unobstructed a patient's leg and arm arteries are. Any competent doctor or nurse can measure and calculate a patient's ABI. # It is crucial that compression stockings are properly sized. The compression should gradually reduce from the highest compression at the smallest part of the ankle, until a 70% reduction of pressure just below the knee. Vascular doctors and nurses may use special pads to ensure uniform higher pressure around the circumference of the ankle (to smooth out the irregular cross-sectional profile.) Self-prescription is reasonably safe assuming that the compression gradient is 15‚Äì20 mmHg, the ABI (for both legs) is >1.0 and that the stockings fit correctly. \\"Firm\\" gradient stockings (20‚Äì30 mmHg and 30‚Äì40 mmHg) should generally be worn only on medical advice. Although current research reports mixed results of compression socks on athletic performance, there is anecdotal evidence from athletes that they can benefit from such stockings.  Knee- high versus thigh-high  Knee-high and thigh-high anti-embolism compression stockings The graduated (gradient, graded) compression stockings and anti- embolism compression stockings come in knee-high and thigh-high length. A meta-analysis by Sajid et al. was done to compare knee-high and thigh-high graded compression stockings in regards of deep vein thrombosis prevention in medical and surgical patients. This study revealed that there was a 6% risk of developing deep vein thrombosis when wearing knee-high stockings and 4% when wearing thigh-high stockings. It concluded that there was no significant difference in the length of compression stockings when used for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. It was suggested that knee-high compression stockings should be the first choice for the deep vein thrombosis prevention in medical and surgical patients. Knee-high stockings are more comfortable, easier to apply, and wearing them increases patients' compliance with treatment. Knee- high stockings are easier to size for limb measurement than thigh-high compression stockings. Thigh-high compression stockings may create a tourniquet effect and cause localized restriction when rolled down. A study of patients treated for post-thrombotic syndrome, performed in Italy, revealed that redness and itching of the skin was reported in 41% of patients wearing thigh-high and 27% in patients wearing knee-high compression stockings. Consequently, 22% of thigh-high wearers and 14% of knee-high wearers stopped the treatment. Compression classes Compression stockings are constructed using elastic fibers or rubber. These fibers help compress the limb, aiding in circulation. Compression stockings are offered in different levels of compression. The unit of measure used to classify the pressure of the stockings is mmHg. They are often sold in a variety of pressure ranges. Over- the-counter support is available in 10-15 or 15-20 mmHg. Higher pressure stockings require a prescription and a trained fitter. These higher pressures range from 20-30 mmHg to 50+ mmHg. Other pressure levels used by manufacturers for custom-made, flat-knitted products in the US and Europe range from 18-21 mmHg to >50mmHg.  History  Use of compression therapy is not new. As early as the Neolithic period (5000-2500 BCE), images of soldiers with bandaged lower extremities were found in the drawings of the caves of Tassili in Sahara. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, which dates to roughly 1600 BCE, included additional evidence of mechanical compression therapy for legs. Hippocrates treated his patients' leg ulcers with tight bandages, which were described in his Corpus Hippocraticum (450‚Äì350 BCE). Galen (130-200 CE) used wool and linen compression bandages to prevent blood from pooling in the legs and Oribassius (324 CE) used to treat leg ulcers with tight bandages. During the Middle Ages, the leading use of leg compression bandages was mainly for therapy. This is evidenced by the works of Avicenna (980‚Äì1037); Giovanni Michele Savonarola (1384‚Äì1468); Ambroise Par√© (1510‚Äì1590); Girolamo Fabrizio di Acquapendente (1537‚Äì1619); and other scientists. Guy de Chauliac in his book Chirurgica Magna described the use of compression bandages to treat enlarged veins of the legs. Giovanni Michele Savonarola also treated varicose veins with the help of the leg bandages and described their proper application in his work Practice. In 1628, William Harvey discovered the link between venous stasis and the external pressure. Following that discovery, various compression measures were introduced for therapy: laced stockings, elastic bands, and tight bandages with resin. Later, new textile materials started to be used for the production of compression stockings: natural or cellulose fibers (silk, cotton, coconut) and chemical (acrylic, nylon, polyester). It was only at the end of the 19th century, after Fisher and Lasker, German phlebologists, discovered that the application of the external pressure helped to treat blood clots in the lower extremities, that compression stockings started to be used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. Society and culture Commonly used terms *Anti-embolism ‚Äì Worn by non-ambulatory or post-surgical patients to help prevent pooling of blood in the legs that could lead to a venous thrombosis. *Custom ‚Äì Made for a specific individual. *Circular knit ‚Äì Seamless stockings that offer greater aesthetic appeal. *Flat knit ‚Äì Stockings made with a seam that can be constructed in virtually any shape or size. Most often used in higher compression classes. *Silver ‚Äì Stockings constructed using special silver textile fibers. Silver offers natural anti-microbial protection. *Lymphedema ‚Äì Stockings used to manage edema resulting from the onset of lymphedema. *Support ‚Äì Mild compression stockings sold over-the-counter and without a physician's prescription. These stockings are commonly referred to as TED hose, short for _t_ hrombo _e_ mbolism- _d_ eterrent hose. They are used to support the venous and lymphatic drainage of the leg. Economy class stroke syndrome There is a possible link between a common physical defect in the heart and potentially deadly stroke that could occur during long aeroplane flights. The connection, called \\"economy class stroke syndrome,\\" has been reported in healthy, young travelers who suffered ischemic strokes during or shortly after long air trips. Prolonged sitting associated with air travel is known to be a cause of clots in the legs. Upward of 30 percent of the population is estimated to have patent foramen ovale (PFO), a common condition where a small hole exists between the right and left sides of the heart. PFO rarely causes any adverse medical condition and can be determined only through specific diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram.

Though he was a reluctant writer and completed only three plays in his career, two have become well-known: the London-based stage thriller Dial M for Murder, which was later filmed in Hollywood by Alfred Hitchcock, and the 1966 play Wait Until Dark, which also was adapted to a Hollywood film directed by Terence Young. He also wrote the Broadway mystery Write Me a Murder. Life and career Knott was born in Hankou, China, the son of English missionaries, Margaret Caroline (Paull) and Cyril Wakefield Knott. He was educated at Oundle School from 1929 to 1934 and later gained a law degree from Cambridge University. He became interested in theatre after watching performances of Gilbert and Sullivan works held by the Hankow Operatic Society. Frederick Knott was descended from a line of wealthy Lancashire mill-owners, and in 1926 his parents sent him to England, where he studied at Sidcott and Oundle School before going up to Cambridge in 1934. An exceptionally fine tennis player (a profession he gave the central character in Dial M for Murder), he became a Blue and in 1937 he was a member of the Oxford-Cambridge tennis team that played the Harvard-Yale squad at Newport. It was only the advent of the Second World War that prevented his competing at Wimbledon. He graduated in 1938, then served during the war in the Artillery as an instructor in signals, ending his service with the rank of major. He served in the British Army Artillery as a signals instructor from 1939 to 1946, rising to the rank of Major, and eventually moved to the United States. He met Ann Hillary in 1952 and married her in 1953; they lived in New York for many years. Although his most successful play, Dial M for Murder, was a hit on the stage, it was originally a BBC television production. As a theatre piece, it premiered at the Westminster Theatre in Victoria, London, in June 1952, directed by John Fernald and starring Alan MacNaughtan and Jane Baxter. This production was followed in October by a successful run in New York City at the Plymouth Theater, where Reginald Denham directed Richard Derr and Gusti Huber. Knott also wrote the screenplay for the 1954 Hollywood movie which Hitchcock filmed for Warner Brothers in 3D, starring Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, with Anthony Dawson and John Williams reprising their characters from the New York stage production, which had won Williams a Tony Award for his role as Inspector Hubbard. He had previously sold the screen rights to Alexander Korda for only ¬£1,000. The play was also made into a 1981 TV movie starring Christopher Plummer and Angie Dickinson, as the 1985 film Aitbaar in India, and as A Perfect Murder in 1998 with Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow. Based on the same plot, a Soviet 2-series TV film Tony Wendice's Mistake (:ru:–û—à–∏–±–∫–∞ –¢–æ–Ω–∏ –í–µ–Ω–¥–∏—Å–∞) was released in 1981. In 1960, Knott wrote the stage thriller Write Me a Murder, which was produced at the Belasco Theatre in New York in October 1961. It was directed by George Schaefer and included Denholm Elliott and Kim Hunter in the cast. In 1966, Knott's stage play Wait Until Dark was produced on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. The director was Arthur Penn and the play starred Lee Remick who received a Tony Award nomination for her performance. Later the same year, Honor Blackman played the lead in London's West End at the Strand Theatre. The film version, also titled Wait Until Dark and released in 1967, had Audrey Hepburn in the lead role. The play ran on Broadway in 2001, featuring Quentin Tarantino. Knott lived comfortably on the income from his three works and did not write the others he had sketched out. \\"I don't think the drive was there any more. He was perfectly happy the way things were,\\" said his wife Ann Hillary. He died in New York City in December 2002.

The district was formed by grouping three Tehsils namely Kasganj, Patiyali and Sahawar on 17 April 2008 when Hasrat Ullah Sherwani was the Member of Legislative Assembly from Kasganj Vidhan Sabha.  History  Kasganj was also known as 'Khasganj' during Mughal and British period. According to 'Imperial Gazetteer of India Vol. XV' (1908) by William Wilson Hunter Kasganj came in the hands of James V. Gardner (who was in the employ of the Marathas and later in the British service) and later died in here in Chhaoni, Kasganj.https://histfam.familysearch.org//getperson.php?personID=I206379&tree;=Welsh Before James Gardner, his father Colonel William Linnaeus Gardner was also stationed here. William Gardner built his estate in Kasganj after retiring from army and he also died in Kasganj in July, 1835.https://histfam.familysearch.org//getperson.php?personID=I206372&tree;=Welsh William and James Gardner belonged to the lineage of Baron Gardner of Uttoxeter, England. Evidences are that heir to the Barony of Gardner is still living somewhere around Kasganj. Famous writer and historian William Dalrymple also came to Kasganj in search of Julian Gardner, heir to the English Barony, while researching for his book White Mughals. Besides, the book of Fanny Parkes namely 'Wanderings of a Pilgrim in search of the Picturesque' gives details of her visits to Kasganj (then Khasgunge) and her mention of the town and Gardner Family. An older description mentioned Kasganj as standing on an elevated site, its drainage flowing towards the Kali Nadi(Black Stream) which runs about a mile south east of the town. The town was constituted a municipality in 1868. Kasganj set in the midst of the strategic Indo-Gangetic plain figured in military and political vicissitudes of ancient kingdom from the Mahabharata onwards. It formed part of the grand empire of Harshavardhan; and it finds mention in the accounts of the 7th century Chinese pilgrim Hsien Tsang (Xuanzang) who passed this way in 647 A.D. In near kasganj city there is a village named Atranjikhera where once Lord gautam Buddha kept his anniversary and place is revered as a holy pilgrim place for buddhist. Excavation here began in 1962, which revealed that site was occupied from 1200 B.C to 300 B.C.http://www.fofweb.com/History/HistRefMain.asp?iPin=EAAC0064&SID;=2&DatabaseName;=Ancient+and+Medieval+History+Online&InputText;=%22Atranjikhera%22&SearchStyle;=&dTitle;=Atranjikhera&TabRecordType;=All+Records&BioCountPass;=0&SubCountPass;=2&DocCountPass;=0&ImgCountPass;=0&MapCountPass;=0&FedCountPass;=&MedCountPass;=0&NewsCountPass;=0&RecPosition;=1&AmericanData;=&WomenData;=&AFHCData;=&IndianData;=&WorldData;=&AncientData;=Set&GovernmentData;= Various artefacts and ruined structures from ancient town have been found in Atranji Khera Achalpur (CHAUHAN's kingdom). Another village near Kasganj, Jakhera is also a major archaeological excavation site. Iron tools like sickles, hoes, ploughshare and terracotta figurines have been found from Jakhera which dates back to 1000B.C. to 600B.C. giving evidence that Jakhera was a part of Painted Grey Ware culture and Northern Black Polished Ware culture of ancient India.https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/sites/silkroad/files/knowledge-bank- article/vol_I%20silk%20road_the%20painted%20grey%20ware%20culture%20of%20the%20iron%20age.pdf Currently research is going on the collected artefacts. These evidences show that Kasganj has a rich history since ancient and medieval times. Kasganj was founded by Nawab Yaqoot Ali Khan, a descendant of the Nawabs of Farrukhabad. The city was known as Yaqoot Ganj in the early sixteenth century, but it later became popularly known as Kasganj because it was established in a thick forest of kans, a vegetation grown abundantly here. The inscription regarding its establishment is still visible in the city's Jama Masjid (big mosque). It is said that the well-protected building at Tehsil Road which houses the tehsil was the residence of Nawab Yaqoot Ali Khan until it was acquired by the British after fall of Awadh. Later the city came into the hands of Kunwar Maharaj Singh Jain, then succeeded by late kunwar Bhartendra singh Jain the only Zamindars of the city. The city was established here because it represented a centre point in the road connections between various small, ancient cities of District Etah, such as Bilram, Marehra, Etah, Sakeet, Atranji Khera and Aligarh. Kasganj is a city of rich cultural heritage. It is the junction of east, west and south UP, that very much reflects through peoples language, dresses and dishes. Direct impact of Brij Pradesh is very much evident. Hindu-Muslim culture is woven fine here. There is a long history of togetherness of both communities with love and respect to each other. Christians and Sikhs are also indispensable part of the society.

History  Olivetan monastery behind the apse and bell-tower with outer columns of the former Temple of Venus and Roma. An oratory putatively was established in the eighth century under Pope Paul I in the portico of the former Temple of Venus and Roma. Tradition holds that at this site both Saints Peter and Paul prayed at the site to challenge Simon Magus.Guida metodica di Roma e suoi contorni, by Giuseppe Melchiorri, Rome (1836); page 353. According to this legend, Simon Magus wanted to prove his pagan powers were greater than those of the apostles, and started levitating in front of Peter and Paul. The two apostles fell on their knees to prayer, asking their God to demonstrate his pre-eminence, and Simon fell, dying. Tradition holds that the basalt stones where the apostles' knees during prayer are embedded in the wall of the south transept. Stone where saint Peter knelt. A church at the site was known by the tenth century, was named Santa Maria Nova (or \\"Nuova\\", \\"New St Mary\\"), to distinguish it from the other church inside the Roman forum devoted to St Mary, Santa Maria Antiqua (\\"Ancient St Mary\\"), which had fallen into ruin by then.This history of construction follows Touring Club Italiano, Roma e dintorni 1965:153f. The relics from the ancient church were moved to this church under Pope Leo.Melchiorri, page 353. Santa Maria Nuova was enlarged in the second half of the tenth century, and then rebuilt by Pope Honorius III in the thirteenth century, adding the campanile and the apse, as well as being decorated with a mosaic Maest√†, a depiction of the Madonna enthroned accompanied by saints. The belltower and apse are now located at the east end of former Roman temple, where the portico and entry stairs stood. Behind (East) of the apse and bell tower are a jumble of structures forming the former monastery with two small courtyards. Flanking the north of these structures and extending further west on both sides towards the Colosseum are the remaining outer columns of the massive ancient Roman temple. Since 1352 the church has been in the care of the Olivetans. In the 16th century, the church was rededicated to Frances of Rome (Francesca Buzzi), who was canonized in 1608 and whose relics are in the crypt. The interior of the church has undergone many refurbishments. The present travertine porch and fa√ßade (1615) were designed and built by Carlo Lambardi. Description View of the presbytery with the apse mosaic of the Maesta. The inscriptions found in Santa Francesca Romana (S. Maria Nuova), a valuable source illustrating the history of the church, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.V. Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chese e d' altre edifici di Roma, dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI Volume II (Roma: Fratelli Bencini, 1873), pp. 1-16. The interior, a single nave with side chapels, was rebuilt by Lombardi in the years preceding Francesca Buzzi's canonization, beginning in 1595. In the middle of the nave is the rectangular schola cantorum of the old church, covered in Cosmatesque mosaics. Another prominent feature is the confessional designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1638‚Äì49), in polychrome marbles with four columns veneered in jasper. Among the altarpieces are works by Pietro Tedeschi, Padre Pozzi, and Subleyras. Tomb of Gregory XI The sacristy houses the precious Madonna Glycophilousa (\\"Our Lady of Tenderness\\"), an early 5th- century icon brought from Santa Maria Antiqua. The twelfth-century Madonna and Child had been painted over. It was meticulously detached from the panel in 1950. The tomb of Pope Gregory XI, who returned the papacy to Rome from Avignon, reconstructed to a design by Per Paulo Olivieri (signed and dated 1584) is in the south transept. The Deaconry was suppressed on 8 August 1661. S. Maria Nova was reestablished, as the Titulus of a Cardinal Priest, on 17 March 1887 by Pope Leo XIII. The titulus of the church remains Sancta Mariae Novae; the current Cardinal Priest of the Titulus S. Mariae Novae is Angelo Sodano. A Cardinal Priest no longer has any jurisdiction over his titular church or its clergy.Codex Iuris Canonici (1983), Canon 357. ¬ß 1.

He is only the Cardinal Protector. Saint Francesca Romana has been named the patron of car drivers, because of a legend that an angel used to light her way with a lamp when she travelled at night. Automobiles line up on the day of her feast (9 March) as far as the Colosseum, to partake of the blessing.(TCI) Roma e dintorni 1965:153.

Overview An hour drive from district headquarters Dhanbad, Katras is a place where people from various religions and communities live together. Katras comes under Dhanbad municipal corporation and it is very popular for its Durga puja celebration. It is located on the bank of river Katri and is surrounded by coal mines. Lilori temple is the most important point of interest in Katras. The chief source of income is primarily from the coal mines of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), headquartered in Dhanbad City. However, incomes from BCCL has always been limited and new sources of income have not evolved fairly, residents of Katras have begun to migrate to other cities for reasons such as job, higher studies and so on. The students of Katras mainly migrates as there isnt any educational excellence present in Katras.It is well connected via railways and roads. Nearest functional airport is in Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand. As per the reports says,Katras will soon be getting a functional airport at its nearby city, Bokaro Steel City.Few years back, the city suffered the loss of its railway connectivity, as the senior of Coal India Limited came out with the reports of Coal Under the Rail Tracks. The Railways again came to function after a strike of about 700 days, the longest ever supported by many political leaders of the area.Qamar Takhyan, a well known novelist of Urdu and English also lives here. His novel The Heart of Amber was published in England, USA and in India in October 2014. History Katras is named after river \\"Katri\\", which flows by Katras. It is believed that people have been living in Katras for more than 200 years. And later around 1900 AD many migrants from Bihar came and settled here, as Bihar was suffering from a severe famine. Many coal mines were founded in Katras under British Rule. New Railway route from Asansol to Ranchi via Dhanbad and Katras was created in 1894 and Katras Railway station was founded around 1900 (later it was re- established in 1953 and came to be known as Katrasgarh). Geography Location Katras is located at . It has an average elevation of 201 metres (659 feet). Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the area. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. The earlier census town was combined with other urban units to form Dhanbad Municipal Corporation in 2006. Katras is part of Ward No. 1 of Dhanbad Municipal Corporation. The region The region shown in the map is a part of the undulating uplands bustling with coalmines. The Damodar River, the most important river of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, flows along the southern border. The area beyond the Damodar was once a part of Dhanbad district but was transferred to Bokaro district in 2001. Bulk of the area shown in the map is part of Baghmara (community development block). In Baghmara CD block 67% of the population lives in rural areas and 33% in urban areas. The block has 18 census towns, all marked in the map, except Rajganj, which is shown in the map for the northern portion of the district. A portion of Dhanbad Municipal Corporation extends into the region till around Katras. The places in the DMC area are marked as neighbourhoods. Most of the DMC area is shown in the maps for the central and southern portions of the district. Four operational areas of BCCL operate fully within the region ‚Äì Katras Area, Govindpur Area, Barora Area and Block II Area. The Mahuda sector of Western Jharia Area also operates in the region. Neighbourhoods Katras neighbors many cities such as Dhanbad,Bokaro Steel City, Bagamara,Rajganj and so on. There are several ponds in Katras such as Raja Bandh, Rani Bandh, Guhi Bandh and others. Most of them, however, are under threat. Telia Bandh- once a big pond is now almost extinct and same is the story of all other ponds. Population burden has created the problem of space and ponds are losing out to residential buildings. This has made the water crisis more acute. Nowadays two water tanks are made near Katras College. Katri River near Lilori Temple Katri Nadi is a small river which passes through the area. It discharges its water into the Damodar. It is a river of rainy season so most of the time water level is very low. In Chhapulwa a small dam has been made from where water is supplied to the railways. Green Park- A Green Park has been developed by Katras Area, BCCL which is in 3.02 Ha area over overburden dump located at Keshalpur. The primary purpose for developing the park is restoring the ecology at mining area. This park is full of greenery where one can enjoy in the lap of nature. Several swings are established in this green park Katras is also surrounded by much religious pilgrimage such as Lilori Mandir, Surya Mandir, Bajrang Balj Mandir, Katras Taj Masjid, Bada Gurudwara, Sjiua Church and so on. Demographics In 2011 India census, Katras had a population of 51,182. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Katras has an average literacy rate of 84%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 87%, and female literacy is 76%. In Katras, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.  Government and public services   Civic administration  Katras was established as a notified area in the Dhanbad district along with Jharia, Chatatand, and Sindri. In 2006, the notified areas were merged into the district under the jurisdiction of the Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC).http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060610/asp/jamshedpur/story_6334372.asp It is allocated to the Baghmara development block of the district and has its own police station.http://dhanbad.nic.in/administration/structure.htm  Utility services  Water is a perennial problem. Electricity has the same story of want and deficiency. A water project started several years back never fructified because of corruption and mis- management. The water tower constructed in Dak Bunglaw was of such low quality that experts dreaded storing water in it lest it be sagging, endangering lives of local people. Thousands of hand pumps and submersibles have led to a severe fall in ground water level. People carrying water in plastic containers on bicycles is a common sight. Economy The chief source of income is BCCL, the coal company. It employs a large number of people. Collieries functioning in the Katras Area of BCCL are: Salanpur, Angarpathar, Keshalpur, Ramkanali, Ramkanali OC, West Mudidih, Gazlitand, Keshalpur OC, Katras Chot and East Katras. Agriculture is under-developed. The farm size is tiny and ancient tools are used. BCCL is now retrenching and closing its mines because of the depletion of the coal in the mines. The new professions which have emerged in the area are Coal-thefthttp://www.prabhatkhabar.com/news/20297-story- article.html and Dalali (Agent-ship). So in the early morning you would find hundreds of cycle-wallah carrying coal illegally to the Nischitpur Railway Halt, from where it would be carried to Gaya and other areas by Passenger trains(sic). In fact some times passengers would not be allowed to board the train so that more of the coal could be carried. Administration- both local and railway maintains a deathly silence. Railway Police people can be seen to take money from coal-thieves as their cut. Dalali is an important vocation here with increasing number of people taking to it. Mind you this is not honest. What they do is, in connivance with the local administration charge money from the public for all govt. services. You would end coughing-up several times the actual amount for getting any service. So there are Dalals of local Police Station, of Block development office, of SDM's office, of DM's office. If one goes otherwise than through Dalals, the work would be completed in such a long time that one would start feeling that perhaps the whole system is dead and this when one has made many rounds of the office. The main reason for emergence of such vacations is the lack of employment opportunities. People either migrate outside the state or open some retail shop or start coal-theft or Dalali. Now because of the lack of any other source of money in the area most of the newly opened retail shops fail miserably. Though Lilori Temple economy provides employment to some people, even there some people have captured Public infrastructure illegally and charge money from visitors for using them. The economy is crumbling and unless some new source of income is provided the day is not far when it would be counted as sub-Saharan area. Once a bustling market, now shops remain empty most of the time. There are many cloth merchants ranging from Retailers to wholesalers. There are many hard coke plants as well. Apart from these there is a Rajhans Refactories providing employment to over 2500 people. During Durgapuja festival and Lagan (marriage season) retail market gets some impetus but until new source of employment emerges, it will remain a town in slumber. Recently some private insurance companies have opened their offices.  Transport  Buses are main mode of travel, along with automobiles, trackers and tongas. There were three railway stations: Katrasgarh, Nichitpur and Tetulmari. Katrasgarh uptill 15 June 2017 and Tetulmari have express line stops, while Nichitpur is just a halt station. Katrasgarh was also on a loop line and extincted because of fragile underground. Due to closure of Dhanbad - Chandrapura Rail line a huge population has lost connectivity from the entire world, moreover the road connecting Katras to Dhanbad is facing danger of being closed and will be closed soon.

The Katras Hatia is a local village market that runs every Sunday.http://wikimapia.org/11412640/katras-hatia Lilori Temple Road to Lilori Temple Lilori Temple Park Located 5 km from the city center, Lillori Sthan Mandir (Lilori Temple) is an old temple of Goddess Lilori, family deity of local landlord (Raja), who is nowadays considered an incarnation of Goddess Kali.http://www.hoparoundindia.com/jharkhand/dhanbad-attractions/lillori- sthan-mandir.aspx Goddess Lilori, typical to Bengal and neighboring area, is non-vegetarian and daily hundreds of animals are sacrificed on her altar. The temple is one of the few natural picnic spots in the area, even though tree felling and government neglect has ruined much of the greenery. It also attracts thousands of people daily in the summer for weddings. It neighbours local Smashan, where dead bodies are burnt, and sometimes give it a mystic colour. Bharatiya Club It is one of the oldest library in India which solely carries books from Hindi literature. The library was started by the freedom fighter Late Shri Ramanand Khaitan, who was an ardent political activist during the Indian freedom movement. During the British days, the library used to be the melting pot of pro-freedom think-tanks and activists. Today, the library serves the people of Katras and its surrounding areas, filling a necessary void in providing access to Hindi literature. It has a free and open access reading room which gets a regular supply of newspapers, magazines and journals. Raksha Kali Temple This is a small temple of Raksha Kali in Hatiya(a small vegetable market). Raksha Kali is a very fierce form of Kali and she was supposed to be invoked only when there were calamities like war, epidemic etc. That is why the gate of the temple remains closed all the time. Earlier the gate of the temple were opened only either for the annual Mid-night Puja or on certain occasions like Kali-Puja. Nowadays its gate is being opened daily. This is perhaps either because the Local land- lord (Raja) who was earlier responsible for upkeep of this temple is not able to continue this or because the Pandit who opens its gate expects to earn some money in the way of Aarti-offering etc. Once a year the Goddess is worshiped at mid-night. Offering of some animal is given and Khichdi is cooked with the animal meat. After everybody present there has taken the Prasad of this Khichdi, all remaining materials are buried in front of the temple. There are very small temples of Goddesses like Shitla in the backside of this temple. Rakshash Temple The oldest and most important structure by archaeological and historical point of view is Rakshas temple of Jhinjhi Pahari. This temple is made of stones only and not even small amount of any other, including sand, material has been used to join them. It is understood to be at least six hundred years old. It is said that a similar temple was situated just in front of the Lilori Temple which fell in an earth quack and that these two temples signified some treasure. There is a myth that the temple was constructed by Lord Vishwakarma in a single night.  Healthcare  Despite having a fairly large population, Katras is lacking any quality medical facilities. There are several hospitals though none have any facilities for dealing with emergencies on a 24-hour basis. Katras has no facility for intensive care and the local diagnostic centers are considered unreliable. There is rampant medical corruption with doctors recommending unnecessary tests and costly medicines. Underlined tests (in the prescription) are not supposed to be carried out. They are only for cheating patients. Tilatand Hospital of BCCL used to be a centre for better treatment, now-a-days it remains empty most of the times. This when there is no better alternative. Most people either go to Dhanbad (for minor treatments) or Bokaro (for major treatment) and finally to CMC, Vellore for better treatment. The lone train from Dhanbad to Allepey (that too taken away) was full of patients. There is an urgent need of a good hospital either in private sector or in public sector.

The location of this tank is between latitudes 11 15 ‚Äò E and 11 25‚Äô E and Longitudes 79 30‚Äô N and 79 35‚Äô N Climate Like most of coastal Tamil Nadu, the areas adjoining Veeranam tank has a sub-tropical climate receiving most of the rainfall during the North-East monsoons from Oct - Dec. Hot weather prevails in the summer months from March to June, and the maximum temperature varies from 30‚Äì38 ¬∞C. Being close to the coast cyclones that strike the area have a profound impact, resulting in heavy rains. Two rainfall monitoring stations are located in Veeranam Tank one at its right bank i.e. Kattumannarkoil and another at left bank i.e. Sethiathope. The average rainfall in these stations is more than the state average of 950 mm. During the last 18 years the average annual rainfall in Kattumannarkoil is 1025 mm. In Sethiathope, the average annual rainfall during the last 25 years is 1273 mm. But due to the vagaries of the North-East monsoon, Veeranam tank often has to depend on water from Mettur dam. History of the tank Veeranam Tank is one of the biggest tanks in Tamil Nadu and also an age old one. This tank has been referred briefly in the book called \\" Ponniyen Selvan\\" Written by the famous author ‚ÄòKalki‚Äô in the year 1950. This book gives the information on the age of this tank and it has been mentioned that the tank was formed at a period of more than 1000 years by the Prince Rajathithar Son of Parandage Chola. The tank was originally called as Veeranarayanan Tank. When king Paranthaga Cholan I ruled over Chola Kingdom during the 10th century i.e. 907 to 935 AD he wanted to improve the Irrigation facilities in and around Chidambaram. He formed a village called as ‚ÄòVeera Narayana Sathurvethi Mangalam. This Village was gifted to the Scholars who were well versed in the Four Vedhas. This Village is now called as Kattumannarkoil which is situated in the right flank of Veeranam Tank. He then formed the biggest tank and named it as ‚ÄòVeera Narayanan Eri‚Äô ‚ÄòVeera Narayanan‚Äô is the nickname given to king Paranthaga Cholan I for his Valour. Subsequently, this tank is now called Veeranam Tank. During the later period of Chola Kingdom, King Rajendra Cholan I who ruled during the period 1012 AD to 1044 AD, Spread his kingdom up to Ganges. He conquered the lands up to River Ganges. In Memory of his Victory he formed the Village ‚Äò Gangai Konda Cholapuram‚Äô during the year 1024 AD. In addition to that in order to improve the Irrigation facilities in and around the new Village, he formed a new tank and called it as ‚ÄòChola ‚Äò Gangam‚Äô. He made a link between ‚ÄòChola gangam‚Äô and Veeranarayanan Eri so that the former surpluses into the later. The tank ‚ÄòChola Gangam‚Äô is now called as ‚Äò Ponneri Tank‚Äô which is situated at the road connecting Jeyamkondam and Gangaikonda Cholapuram. These details were collected from Saraswathi Mahal Library at Tanjore. Notable people * Nathamuni (c. 900 ‚Äì 950 CE) is supposed to have born in Kattumannarkoil. He was a Tamil Vaishnava scholar who founded the Sri Vaishnava tradition. He was responsible for bringing back the Naalayira Divya Prabandham that had been lost to the world.

Life The future al-Zafir was born in late February 1133 as the fifth son of the eleventh Fatimid imam-caliph, al-Hafiz li-Din Allah (). As all his older brothers predeceased their father, al-Zafir was appointed heir-apparent. Al-Zafir was proclaimed caliph immediately after his father's death, on 10 October 1149. To calm the rival military factions of the Turks and Black Africans, who were clashing in the streets of Cairo, a generous donative was distributed and promises were made to look after them. The situation was brought under control in November, when the vizier, Ibn Masal, executed the faction leaders. Al-Zafir then turned to the pleasures of his harem, but a revolt by the governor of Alexandria, Ibn al-Sallar, overthrew Ibn Masal. After being recognized as vizier by the caliph, Ibn al- Sallar had his predecessor executed. The imam-caliph al-Zafir was murdered by his vizier, Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh and his son Nasr, who succeeded Ibn al- Sallar. Al-Zafir never exercised power in his own right, with his viziers exercising real power. Instead of devoting himself to the administration, al- Zafir exceedingly inclined to a life of pleasure. He was murdered at the age of 21 years in 1154 and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, al-Faiz.

Slocum was the first person to sail around the world alone. The book was an immediate success and highly influential in inspiring later travelers. Background Captain Slocum was a highly experienced navigator and ship owner. He rebuilt and refitted the derelict sloop Spray in a seaside pasture at Fairhaven, Massachusetts, over 13 months between early 1893 and 1894. Between 24 April 1895 and 27 June 1898, Slocum, aboard the Spray, crossed the Atlantic twice (to Gibraltar and back to South America), negotiated the Strait of Magellan, and crossed the Pacific. He also visited Australia and South Africa before crossing the Atlantic (for the third time) to return to Massachusetts after a journey of 46,000 miles. The book Slocum attracted considerable international interest by his journey, particularly once he had entered the Pacific. He was awaited at most of his ports of call, and gave lectures and lantern-slide shows to well-filled halls. His journal was first published in installments before being issued in book form in 1900. The book was lavishly illustrated. Slocum tells his story as a sequence of adventures, understating his own part and giving credit always to the Spray. He invents a crew-member, a supposed pilot of Columbus' Pinta, to take credit for the safety of the vessel while he sleeps. The trip itinerary was as follows: Fairhaven, Boston, Gloucester, Nova Scotia, Azores, Gibraltar, (Morocco), Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Maldonado, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Strait of Magellan, Cockburn Channel, Port Angosto, Juan Fernandez, Marquesas, Samoa, Fiji, Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania, Cooktown, Christmas Island, Keeling Cocos, Rodrigues, Mauritius, Durban, Cape Town, (Transvaal), St Helena, Ascension Island, Devil's Island, Trinidad, Grenada, Newport, Fairhaven. The Spray Highlights of the journey included perils of sailing blue water, such as fog, gales, danger of collision, loneliness, doldrums, navigation, fatigue, gear failure. Other perils of coastal navigation included pirates, attack by 'savages', embayment, shoals and coral reefs, stranding, and shipwreck. Passing by Tierra del Fuego, he was warned that he might be attacked by the indigenous Yahgan Indians in the night, so he sprinkled tacks on the deck. He was awakened in the middle of the night by yelps of pain. He was proud of resourcefully defending himself. He devised a system of lashing the wheel into what a later era might call a kind of mechanical autopilot. He took pride in the fact that the Spray sailed 2000 miles west across the Pacific without his once touching the helm.  1950s attempt to recreate Slocum's voyage  In the mid-1950s, Robert Carr of Monkton, Vermont, built a replica of the Spray using the shipbuilding methods of the late 1800s. He announced his intention to sail around the world recreating Slocum's voyage. While one article reported the replica Spray and Carr's announcement, there is no documented evidence that he made a circumnavigation.\\"On the Trail of the Spray\\", Popular Mechanics, June 1956, pp. 78-81/242.

It is situated on the shores of Loch Ewe, about 30 km west of Ullapool. The village has a Primary School. The village has two closed hotels; the Aultbea Hotel, which closed without warning following a phone call from the owner to staff one morning, and The Drumchork Lodge Hotel, which won the accolade of top whisky hotel in the world in 2006 and was the home of the Loch Ewe Distillery, also closed. The Drumchork Lodge Hotel is currently closed and waiting refurbishment by new owners. Aultbea has two churches, a shop, a masonic lodge and a craft shop. Aultbea also has a NATO base; large ships often come inshore to refuel here. There is also an annual \\"fun day\\" where most people from the village and surrounding area turn up and play football or socialise over a home baked scone as well other activities. The nearest airport is in Stornoway, although that is across the sea and thus not convenient for onward travel to Aultbea. The nearest railway station is at Achnasheen which has trains either to the Inverness or through scenic Plockton to Kyle of Lochalsh. There is also a ferry service to the Isle of Lewis in the relatively nearby town of Ullapool. This service was once proposed to be based in Aultbea but due to Aultbea's remote setting Ullapool was granted the ferry port. In 1893 there was also to be a rail track to Aultbea but again the decision went against the village as demand for such a service was expected to be low.  Sport  Aultbea has an amateur football team, although they play away, Gairloch and Aultbea merged into one team under the name Gairloch Aultbea United or GA United. Nowadays its just Gairloch juniors that play in GA. Most of the population support Scottish Premier League side Ross County F.C., based in Dingwall ( away), as they are the closest league team to the area.  Attractions  Aultbea offers sandy beaches as well as rocky shores which all look out at the Isle of Ewe across the water. Scattered around the area are the remains of World War II buildings and barracks. Next to the local football pitch is a display board, which describes the role of the buildings in detail. Aultbea has views out to Cove and the Isle of Lewis, as well as the nearby Torridon Hills. There is a small, blue bar situated at the side of the Aultbea Hotel which offers great views of the shore and bird life.  Geography and climate  The coast is affected by the Gulf Stream, bringing relatively warm waters. These are ideal for jellyfish, which can swarm the local waters, as well as visiting dolphins. The Northern Lights are visible on occasion depending on the weather and time of year, around the equinox being best. The record lowest temperature is amongst the highest in the UK.

Life Hudleston was born at York on 2 June 1828. He was the eldest son of John Simpson of Knaresborough (the third in succession to practise medicine) and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Ward of Dore House, near Handsworth. His mother was an heiress through her mother, Eleanor Hudleston (died 1856), of the family of Hudleston of Hutton John, Cumberland. Wilfred, who with the rest of his family assumed the surname of Hudleston by royal licence in 1867, was educated first at St Peter's School, York, and afterwards at Uppingham, proceeding to St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1850 and M.A. in 1853. At Cambridge, he was interested chiefly in ornithology, which he had begun to study at school. In 1855 he spent a summer in Lapland, collecting with Alfred Newton and John Woolley. After visiting Algeria and the eastern Atlas with Henry Baker Tristram and Osbert Salvin, he spent more than a year in Greece and Turkey adding to his collections. From 1862 to 1867, he systematically studied natural history and chemistry, attending courses of lectures at the University of Edinburgh, and afterwards at the Royal College of Chemistry in London. Undecided at first whether to make chemistry or geology his chief subject, he was drawn to the latter by the influence of John Morris. Tomb in St Andrew's Church, Ham Settling in London, although he lived part of the year on property at West Holme,East Stoke Parish, Dorset West Holme is a village in the rural parish of East Stoke in Dorset. Dorset, and at Knaresborough, he began his career as a geologist. Engaging actively in the work of the Geologists' Association, he served as secretary from 1874 to 1877, and supplied many reports of their excursions. He was president of the association (1881‚Äì83). He became a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1867, was secretary (1886‚Äì90), and president from 1892 to 1894. He contributed to the society's Journal, among others, a paper (with the Rev. J. F. Blake) on the Corallian rocks of England. Other papers on the Jurassic system appeared in the Geological Magazine, and in 1887 he began to publish in the Pal√¶ontographical Society's volumes a monograph on the inferior oolite gastropods, which, when completed in 1896, comprised 514 pages of letterpress and 44 plates. It was largely founded on his own collection of these fossils, which he bequeathed to the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge. In 1884, Hudleston was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1886 and the following year he undertook some dredging in the English Channel for mollusca, and aided the foundation of a marine laboratory at Cullercoats, Northumberland. Early in 1895 he made a journey in India, travelling from Bombay as far as Srinagar. Hudleston, who received the Geological Society's Wollaston Medal in 1897, presided over the geological section of the British Association in 1898. He received, with the other three original members, a gold medal at the jubilee of the British Ornithologists' Union in December 1908. He was also a president of the Devonshire Association and other local societies. In 1906 he funded the construction of what became the Dove Marine Laboratory, now part of the University of Newcastle, after the original site had been destroyed by fire. Hudleston died on 29 January, 1909, aged 80. He is buried at St Andrew's Church, Ham which is now in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

CIQM's studios are at 743 Wellington Road while its transmitter is located near Byron in West London. CIQM operates on a frequency once occupied by CKO from 1977 to 1989.  History  CIQM originally operated as Q103 at 103.1 FM (now the home of CFHK-FM in St. Thomas) from its sign-on in 1986Decision CRTC 86-19 until moving to the 97.5 frequency vacated by CKO in 1993.Decision CRTC 93-20 For many years, the station was known as Q97.5, even after taking on the \\"EZ Rock\\" trademark; in 2006, the \\"Q\\" was dropped and the station became known as simply 97.5, London's EZ Rock. On September 6, 2010, CIQM underwent several changes, including a tweak in branding (as The New Sound of EZ Rock), a new logo and new on-air staff. The station moved from its 24-year-old adult contemporary format to hot adult contemporary. The switch was due to rival CKOT-FM switching from easy listening to a gold-based Soft AC mix, and also because of rimshot rivals CIHR-FM and CHGK-FM, both mainstream AC stations, also being heard in London. The station also dropped the decimal point from the station ID after flipping to Hot AC. Just after the format tweak, Astral switched CIQM's jingles to the Hot AC jingles. Despite all of the changes, CIQM, which once dominated the market, suffered from ratings erosion, and had the lowest share in the London CMA, and was a distant second place behind CKOT. On August 13, 2012, CIQM began stunting with jockless music, as well as their website being replaced by a countdown clock, informing listeners to tune in August 17 at 8 AM.

Vilatte was later consecrated as a bishop by Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church bishops, with the knowledge and permission of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. After being expelled from multiple denominations, he was considered an example of an ', or \\"wandering bishop\\". Although never a bishop within an Old Catholic denomination or sect and denounced by the Union of Utrecht Old Catholic churches, Vilatte became known as the \\"first Old Catholic bishop of the United States\\".  Early life and conversion to Roman Catholicism  Vilatte was born in Paris, France, on . He was raised by his paternal grandparents, who were members of the ' (P√â), an independent church separated from the Roman Catholic Church (RCC) after the Concordat of 1801. Vincent Gourdon wrote that the had about 4,000 adherents Peter Anson, in Bishops at large, says that Vilatte's parents were members of the and that he was probably baptized by a layman. Boyd, however, claims that Vilatte was validly baptized and educated by parents who held Gallican beliefs. Some accounts say that Vilatte was born Roman Catholic. Vilatte lost his parents at a \\"tender age\\". Raised in a Parisian orphanage operated by the Brothers of the Christian Schools where he was conditionally baptized, he received the sacrament of confirmation in Notre Dame de Paris cathedral. His sister became an Augustinian nun, and was evicted from Montrouge, Paris, convent during the enforcement of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. Not yet sixteen, Vilatte served during the Franco-Prussian War in the battalion of the National Guard militia commanded by Jules-Henri-Marius Bergeret, a future member of the Comit√© de vigilance de Montmartre. He intended to become a Roman Catholic priest but, after the war and the Paris Commune, Vilatte emigrated to Canada. There he became a member of the Protestant Methodist Church in Montreal. He worked for two years as a teacher and lay assistant to a French mission priest. He worked as a catechist in a small school near Ottawa and led services. After returning to France in 1873, according to Bernard Vignot in ', Vilatte was called up for military service but refused to obey. He took refuge in Belgium. He spent one year in the House of the Christian Brothers at Namur. Vilatte emigrated to Canada again in 1876. Vilatte spent a second year devoted to private preparation for the priesthood before entering, in 1878, the Congregation of the Holy Cross Fathers' College of St. Laurent, Montreal, Canada. Marx and Blied wrote that he spent three years at the College of St. Laurent and left voluntarily. In the interval between his third and fourth seminary years, Vilatte attended several anti-Catholic lectures by Charles Chiniquy, a priest who left the and became a Presbyterian pastor. Vilatte began to have doctrinal doubts. Chiniquy, a French Canadian, was known as a gifted public speaker. Yves Roby, in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, compared Chiniquy to French Bishop Charles Auguste Marie Joseph, Count of Forbin-Janson, of Nancy and Toul, in his \\"spectacular preaching methods\\", and wrote that Chiniquy's preaching produced \\"genuine religious transformation\\". Chiniquy was dubbed the apostle of temperance. Anthony Cross wrote, in P√®re Hyacinthe Loyson, the (1879‚Äì1893) and the Anglican Reform Mission, that \\"some made a living by attacking the Roman Church and the Society of Jesus in particular\\"; he included Chiniquy among a number of excommunicated Roman Catholic priests, such as former Barnabite friar Alessandro Gavazzi, who \\"became anti-Catholic 'no popery' propagandists\\" and \\"received ready support from Protestants.\\" \\"Even some Protestants became indignant\\", according to Roby, at how for five years \\"Chiniquy conducted an unremitting campaign\\" of \\"unrestrained attacks on the Catholic Church, its dogmas, sacraments, moral doctrine, and devotional practices\\". Nicholas Weber, in the Catholic Encyclopedia, wrote that Vilatte became an apostate chiefly due to the influence of Chiniquy. Apostasy is the renunciation of a belief or set of beliefs; specifically, the renunciation of one's religion or faith. According to Ernest Margrander, in the Schaff‚ÄìHerzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vilatte was unable to continue his seminary studies and transferred to The Presbyterian College, Montreal. Two years' study convinced him of both papal additions to a primitive Catholic faith and defective Protestant interpretation of its traditional teachings. By contrast, Anson says there is \\"no record of Vilatte as a student\\" at Presbyterian College. In an 1889 article, John Shea wrote in The American Catholic Quarterly Review that Vilatte was unwilling to leave the . He entered a house of the Alexian Brothers, and became a cook among the Clerics of Saint Viator at Bourbonnais Township, Kankakee County, Illinois. But he stayed only six months. Vilatte became reacquainted with Chiniquy, who lived in nearby St. Anne, Illinois. Chiniquy advised him to begin missionary work among a group of French and Belgians in Green Bay, Wisconsin, who had abandoned Catholicism. In April 1884, he was appointed by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) Board of Home Missions as pastor of a French-language mission in Green Bay. See also He preached against the and distributed Chiniquy's tracts there and in nearby Fort Howard, Marinette, and other parts of Wisconsin. Although Vilatte did not succeed to any extent, according to Shea, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in August. When he made an addition to his chapel, he invited Chiniquy to come and dedicate it. This seemed to close his career as a Presbyterian. Chiniquy introduced Vilatte to Hyacinthe Loyson, a former Carmelite priest who had been excommunicated in 1869. Loyson married in London in 1872. According to Cross, \\"Loyson was too profoundly Catholic to associate with such extremists.\\" Marx and Blied identified Loyson as the source of Vilatte's interest in the Old Catholics' schism. The ' (ECG), founded by Loyson in 1879, was \\"the Paris mission established under the auspices of the Anglo-Continental Society [ (ACS) ] with oversight of a bishop of the Scottish Episcopal Church\\" and \\"a bridgehead in a culture war which had been waged by Anglicans\\". The endeavor \\"was one of a number of Anglican reform mission interventions in Roman Catholic heartlands\\" among the culture wars that were being fought in Germany, Haiti, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland. William Ewart Gladstone, \\"played an important part in encouraging the foundation\\" of the . Loyson collaborated with the \\"in his effort to recall Frenchmen to the principles and practices of the ancient Galilean Church before it was corrupted by Papal innovations.\\" The was an ecumenical organization which saw the \\"hope of Christian Europe appears to rest on the progress of a de-Vaticanised Catholicism and a de-rationalised Protestantism.\\" \\"It was\\", Cross emphasizes, the \\"which master-minded the extraordinary venture in Paris which resulted in the founding\\" of the . Robert Nevin, the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America (PECUSA) rector in Rome, \\"seems to have been present at every juncture in the planning\\" and \\"appears to have been, with [Frederick] Meyrick, the principal strategist in winning Anglican Episcopal backing.\\" Although official Anglican support and \\"regular substantial financial subsidy\\" was withdrawn from the at the end of 1881, it remained unofficially supported. According to Peter-Ben Smit, in Old Catholic and Philippine Independent Ecclesiologies in History, Loyson \\"was a source of concern\\" for the Union of Utrecht's (UU) International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference (IBC) because \\"the Dutch did not want to have anything to do with him and others could not.\\" It was ceded to the archdiocese of Utrecht in 1893, although most parishioners were Gallican Catholics. Shea wrote that, the Old Catholics' schism in the United States, originated with and was managed by the . Loyson directed Vilatte, , to apply to Bishop John H. Brown of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, the nearest Anglo-Catholic bishop. Marx and Blied wrote that Loyson was a proponent of the branch theory within Anglicanism when \\"Vilatte met Loyson\\", and Margrander wrote that Loyson wanted to personally talk with Vilatte regarding Catholic reform in America, and proposed that Vilatte travel to Europe for ordination as priest by a Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland (CKS) bishop, Eduard Herzog of Bern, Switzerland. In 1890, Loyson denied personally knowing Vilatte. Marx and Blied did not known if the two also met during Loyson's second, 1893‚Äì1894, American tour.  Episcopal and Old Catholic  There were two notable missions in the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac, one to the Germans under the leadership of Karl Oppen, formerly a Lutheran minister, the other to the French and Belgians on the Door Peninsula along the Green Bay of Lake Michigan, known as the Old Catholic Mission under the leadership of Vilatte. The Belgian settlement was spread out over parts of Brown, Door, Kewaunee counties. It stretched from the city of Green Bay, the county seat of Brown County, to the city of Sturgeon Bay, the county seat of Door County. Brown's successor, Bishop Charles Chapman Grafton wrote: A feature of area was the number of nationalities represented; Shea described the Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay as one where the faithful were poor, scattered, and spoke too many languages. The bishop had to find priests able to give instructions and hear confessions in English, French, German, Dutch, Walloon, Bohemian, Polish, and Menominee, a nation of Native Americans living in Wisconsin. In a small congregation of a hundred families, a priest might find three languages necessary for the exercise of the ministry. It was not easy to obtain priests able to take charge of these missions, or to prevent their becoming discouraged when they found even the scanty allowance expected by a priest almost impossible. Grafton wrote that it had been said that nearly 70% of the population were foreigners or descendants of foreigners. Grafton also listed Swedes, Belgians, Norwegians, Danes, Icelanders, Bulgarians, Italians, Greeks, and Armenians. Grafton wrote that if the Episcopal Church was Catholic in its doctrine and worship it certainly could reach members of those several nationalities and supply their spiritual needs. The Episcopal Church planted in localities where most of the people were Swedes or Bulgarians or Belgians had found a footing and congregations had developed. Brown had no use for Vilatte as an Episcopal priest, having no French Episcopalians for Vilatte to minister to. A number of Roman Catholics situated in Door County, who were mostly Belgian, had broken away from the Holy See and had taken the position of Old Catholics. Brown laid the situation before the Episcopal bishops in council. They agreed to let Brown take charge of the work as bishop and permitted the use there of the Old Catholic liturgy as used in Switzerland. The intention was to form a type of separate rite within the Episcopal Church. Brown informed Grafton of these facts and Bishop John Williams, the Presiding Bishop, also, when Grafton became bishop, he confirmed this intention. A pamphlet published in connection with Vilatte's mission admitted to what Shea considered as fraud and dishonesty; Shea quoted: Hjalmar Holand wrote, in History of Door County, Wisconsin, the County Beautiful, that \\"the term Episcopalian was not familiar to the Belgians [so] he represented himself as Old Catholic, a term which is sometimes used synonymously\\", according to Holand, \\"and has a more commendable sound to Catholic ears.\\" Vilatte followed Loyson's alternative advice to consult with Brown. Vilatte \\"had joined the Protestant Episcopal Church in America.\\"  Priest  Vilatte became, according to their official record, a candidate for Holy Orders in the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac. Vilatte entered the Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee's Nashotah House seminary in Nashotah, Wisconsin. According to the Journal of the eleventh annual council of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Fond du Lac, he was recommended as candidate for ordination as a priest in April 1885; and in May, he was recommended for ordination as a deacon; but, the journal does not note that during the annual council, June 2‚Äì3, 1885, he was in Europe and would be ordained within days. An unorganized mission called Good Shepherd, located in Fond du Lac, is mentioned but not associated with a missionary by name. Brown sent Vilatte to Herzog. Shortly after the synod in Bern, Vilatte arrived with dimissorial letters from Brown. Herzog was advised by Charles Reuben Hale to proceed. Herzog, acting for Brown and at his request \\"with a generosity which should never be forgotten in the annals of the American Church\\", ordained Vilatte within three days of his arrival. This was done \\"under peculiar circumstances\\" \\"to advance the candidate to the priesthood more speedily than the canons of the American Church permit.\\" He was presented for ordination by Hale, \\"whose share in this transaction ought also gratefully to be remembered.\\" His ordination took place in Bern's Old Catholic cathedral in the following order: minor orders and subdiaconate, ; diaconate, ; and, priesthood, . Vilatte took his canonical oath of obedience to the Bishop of Fond du Lac. It was not until the next year, 1886, that his ordination, \\"at the request of the Bishop of Fond du Lac\\", is noted in the Journal of the twelfth annual council of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Fond du Lac. Without mentioning any dates, Brown said that Herzog, at Vilatte's ordination, \\"had pledged him to canonical obedience to the Bishop of Fond du Lac\\" and sent him \\"not as a missionary responsible to himself [...] but as a priest under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of this diocese.\\" Brown then added Vilatte to the diocesan clerical list, as a missionary priest, and made \\"this public statement of the peculiar circumstances of the case.\\" Grafton revealed years later, in the Journal of the fourteenth annual council of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Fond du Lac, that sending Vilatte to Bern \\"seemed [...] more expedient, as the Canons [...] would have compelled at least a year's delay in [...] Vilatte's ordination [...]\\" Herzog ordained others in a similar way. Alexander Robertson described the case of Ugo Janni, in Campello and Catholic Reform in Italy. After failing to establish a self-sustaining mission in Rome, which was supported by the through \\"a committee of direction and aid\\" led by Nevin, Count Enrico di Campello, a canon of St. Peter's Basilica who resigned and left the , turned to Arrone, in Umbria's Nera river valley, which seemed suited for re-establishing his reformation efforts. In 1889, Campello visited San Remo, on the Italian Riviera, as Robertson's guest where he was introduced to the syndic and \\"to many other persons of influence in the town\\" on his first visit. He visited a second time. \\"To secure as influential and representative an audience as possible, admission was made by tickets\\" to Campello's discourses held, with permission of the syndic, in the town theater. \\"All were, evidently, earnest students and followers of Mazzini\\", according to Robertson. Therefore, Campello argued that Giuseppe Mazzini's idea was realised in his sect, the ', although, according to Campello, Mazzini's philosophy was defective. Those supporters, in San Remo, decided to establish an exclusive church in San Remo. Robertson wrote that a \\"fact in connection with the San Remo church is this. All its members gave evidence of their Christian knowledge and character before they were admitted; and their admission was only given in answer to their own written application.\\" It included \\"men of education, position, and influence.\\" Robertson added that \\"the English visitors, who reside there during the winter, have, as a whole, taken a lively interest in Campello's movement, and have extended to it their support.\\" Although Janni was only trained by Campello and evangelized in Arrone, \\"the time had come for him to receive ordination\\" so he \\"would then be in a position to organize a congregation at San Remo and administer the sacraments.\\" Campello communicated on this matter with John Wordsworth, the Church of England's Bishop of Salisbury, \\"who, after fully satisfying himself as to the candidate's fitness by examination and by other ways\\", recommended Janni to Herzog, who then ordained him. As a newly ordained priest, Vilatte went to the tiny settlement of Little Sturgeon, Wisconsin, and secured a log cabin about south, fronting on Green Bay. He divided the log cabin into a dwelling section and a chapel section. This was called the ' mission, Little Sturgeon. Classified as an \\"unorganized mission\\" in the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac, ' was established in 1885 with Vilatte designated as the missionary priest taking charge on . He received a missionary stipend. Grafton wrote that Vilatte was given charge of an Old Catholic mission, the property of the church and buildings belonging to the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac. He was partly supported by funds from the Episcopal diocese, sat in council along with the other priests belonging to the diocese, and was visited by the bishop, who confirmed his candidates and was, like any other clergy, under the bishop's jurisdiction. It was listed as a rectory without a church or chapel or other property. ' was reclassified for one fiscal year as a \\"non-reporting unorganized mission\\" and did not report financial data. Grafton wrote that Vilatte gave exaggerated reports about his work. Cornelius Kirkfleet wrote, in The White Canons of St. Norbert, that after he was ordained, Vilatte erected a church and parsonage midway between two Roman Catholic parishes in Door County. In 1888, ' was reclassified again as an \\"unorganized mission\\" with Vilatte designated as the missionary priest; that year, 1888, the Old Catholic Mission supported one married priest with his wife and child, two single priests, and two students. This was called the Precious Blood mission, Little Sturgeon (Gardner). A spiritualist church was also built in 1888 and became a frequently visited stop on a traveling mediums circuit. It is located within of the Precious Blood mission. Although it was admitted in 1888 as an \\"unorganized mission\\", the Precious Blood mission was reclassified for the first time as an \\"organized mission\\" in 1889, with Vilatte designated as the missionary priest taking charge, years earlier, on ; that year, 1889, the Old Catholic Mission supported two priests, one brother and two students. Kirkfleet wrote that Vilatte's \\"'revised' religion spread rapidly in the peninsula\\" and obtained a foothold even in Green Bay. But Marx and Blied though \\"it never attained virility\\" among the Belgians. According to Jean Ducat, in ', Vilatte tried to discredit Adele Brise and her work in Robinsonville (Champion), but the Belgian colonists and priests continued to trust in the \\"providential work\\" such as the first free school in the area. Ducat wrote that the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help became a place of Christian pilgrimage the importance of which grew steadily and contributed to maintaining the Catholic religion in a region plagued by heresy. Brise's reputed mystical visions became, over 150 years later, the first and only Marian apparition in the United States approved by a Roman Catholic diocesan bishop. In 1890, Vilatte proposed to Grafton to be consecrated as a \\"bishop- abbot\\" to the American Old Catholics and as a suffragan bishop to Grafton; but the canons did not allow for that and, as Grafton had no authority to do so, he refused Vilatte's request. Grafton thought Vilatte was neither \\"morally or intellectually fit for the office\\" of bishop. Being ambitious to become a bishop, after Brown's death in 1888, Vilatte applied to the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (OKKN). He claimed that he was elected to the episcopate by the Old Catholic families themselves, at a synod held at the St. Mary's mission. The first time Vilatte sought to reconcile with the is recorded in an , letter from Bishop Frederick Katzer, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, to Vilatte, in which, Katzer wrote that Vilatte would have to publicly retract and make a retreat in a religious community. Marx and Blied wrote that \\"Vilatte wanted to function as a priest\\", so, \\"Katzer added that the Holy See would judge his orders and prescribe what theological studies he should make.\\" Vilatte thanked Katzer for the letter and \\"remarked that he would prefer to see his flock Catholic rather than Protestant.\\" Anson wrote that nothing further developed. Grafton suspended Vilatte for six months after his council declared on that, in their opinion, \\"Vilatte abandoned the Communion of this Church and renounced its ministry.\\" Grafton consulted with Williams as to what he should do. Acting under Williams' advice, Grafton wrote to the Archbishop Johannes Heykamp of Utrecht that he would transfer Vilatte, if Heykamp so wished, from his jurisdiction to that of Heykamp. In this way the would be relieved of Vilatte and not responsible for having any connection with him. Grafton pointed out to Heykamp that all the property of the mission belonged to the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac and was legally held by it. In case of his accepting Vilatte, Vilatte would be obliged to leave this work and Grafton would appoint a replacement. Heykamp wrote to Grafton that after he understood the situation between Vilatte and Grafton, he \\"had declined having any further correspondence\\" with Vilatte. The declined accepting Vilatte. Subsequently, Vilatte repudiated Grafton's jurisdiction and left the , whereupon, according to canons, Grafton deposed him. Vilatte witnessed the complete abandonment by his first congregation. The congregation of the Precious Blood mission was \\"unfaltering in its allegiance\\" to Grafton, as was Gauthier, and declared \\"the unity existing among themselves and their loyalty to the Diocese of Fond du Lac.\\" When he left, Grafton wrote that Vilatte had lost the confidence of all their clergy and people. An alternative narrative also can be found: Brown seized on this as a means of building a bridge with the Old Catholics in Europe and agreed to support Vilatte. In 1888 Brown, who had supported Vilatte morally and financially, died and was succeeded by Grafton. Grafton, unlike Brown, did not favor Vilatte and conflicts soon arose. In order to correct the canonical situation created by Brown, Grafton demanded that Vilatte surrender ownership of his missions to the diocese which had paid for them in the first place; Vilatte complied in August 1890. Despite this, however, the relationship between the two deteriorated fast. At the heart of the dispute was the conflicting vision for Vilatte's missions held by Vilatte and Grafton. Vilatte hoped that Grafton would continue Brown's policy of financing these missions in the hope of converting Roman Catholics to non- papal Old Catholicism and of using these missions as a springboard to founding the Old Catholic Church in North America. Grafton, on the contrary, wished to integrate these missions into his Episcopal diocese. Adding to the dispute was Vilatte's refusal to break with the Franco-Belgians' adamant rejection of Anglican orders as invalid, while accepting the validity of Old Catholic orders; an attitude carried from Roman Catholicism. In the meantime Heykamp, hearing of Vilatte's difficulties with Grafton, wrote to him to disassociate himself from Episcopalians. In reply, Vilatte asked whether the would consecrate him as the Old Catholic bishop for North America. As the and the Catholic Diocese of the Old Catholics in Germany and the delayed answering Vilatte until they had met in the First International Old Catholic Congress in Cologne, Vilatte next sought to affiliate himself with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). He began correspondence with the Bishop Vladimir Sokolovsky of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. When Grafton learned of these developments he published warnings to Episcopalians to stop supporting Vilatte. He also demanded that Vilatte cease operating from the Old Catholic missions owned by the Episcopal diocese. In response Vilatte announced in September 1890 that he was severing relations with the and founded a new independent mission near Green Bay.  St. Anne Colony   Society of the Precious Blood  The Society of the Precious Blood (SPB) was founded in 1887 in Wisconsin by Vilatte, under the name '. There were French Canadians in the northern part of Door Peninsula who worked as laborers and foresters. It was an environment similar to Gatineau in Quebec, where Vilatte had worked as a teacher. Others joined the church, including John B. Gauthier. He had been a teacher in Ottawa and in Illinois. After his ordination for the Precious Blood mission in 1889, he became master of novices and gave a great impulse. He was a spiritual man and a good pedagogue. The children liked him and several became religious under his influence. Certain came with him to Quebec, to minister in the Berthier and Maskinong√© counties and in Montreal. One of them was Stephen C√¥t√©, who is at the origin of the parish of Greater Montreal. The Christian Catholic Church would not have developed as it did without the missionary activity of the religious of the Precious Blood. They preached Christ according to Scripture. Their goal is always to do pastoral work under this impulse. The first nuns, Sister Mary Ashmun and Sister Anne Schoen, joined the in 1894. They were teachers and worked in Wisconsin. Marx and Blied wrote that a letter \\"indicates that two self-styled sisters who operated among the Belgians were induced to join Vilatte for temporal benefits\\" and there was extremely little evidence that the women may have belonged to a Jansenist sisterhood of St Martha. The tried different formulas, including the Benedictine Abbey of St. Dunstan in Wisconsin (1908) under Dom Bernard Harding, and Vilatteville in Mexico,  Sturgeon Bay seminary  In March 1887, Vilatte, pastor of the Precious Blood mission, visited The Independent newspaper office, in Sturgeon Bay, and informed the newspaper that: he had solicited funds for building a seminary and \\"secured several thousand dollars for commencing the work\\", plans were being made in Chicago, furnishings were secured, and \\"construction will be commenced in June\\". He was asked about his order and responded that the \\"order has a large number of adherents\\" in Europe and \\"is doubling every three years\\" in some of those countries. Curiously, the article did not mention the name of the order. In April, the Door County Advocate reported Vilatte visited Sturgeon Bay on to obtain a suitable location for the establishment of a college of his order. Although months earlier Vilatte said \\"construction will be commenced in June\\", by the end of May, the Door County Advocate reported, only that, he had \\"signified his willingness to establish a seminary in this city provided our people see fit to donate the required real estate\\", and that, a benefactor, who \\"will give the society other material aid if it is necessary to secure the institution for this city\\", donated of land. In July, land \\"which has been purchased by the donations of our citizens\\" for the college, was transferred and work was to start on buildings in September. The next day the city council permitted \\"himself and family\\" to reside in a vacant school building; he was to operate a school in that building until his seminary was completed. In October, he began visiting cities along the East Coast of the United States \\"in quest of funds with which to erect the proposed seminary.\\" He was away for several months. But a week after his return from touring the East Coast of the United States, Vilatte shocked Sturgeon Bay. His \\"contemplated seminary\\" would not be established there but elsewhere, wrote The Independent, in an article titled \\"Can this be true?\\" which exasperated that, \\"[t]he reasons given for this change are so extraordinary that we are not prepared to accept the statements made without further testimony.\\" Vilatte wrote to Chris Leonhardt, President of the Business Men's Association, the group which facilitated the land purchase and aided him, that, His letter was seen as a deleterious depiction of their community. The Independent editorialized: Brown died within weeks of Vilatte's announcement, on . By 1889, his scheme was apparent and he was seen as a scoundrel; building a monastery or college, the Door County Advocate wrote, \\"at any rate is the talk\\" nevertheless \\"without ever accomplishing anything\\" substantial. Emma de Beaumont, wife of Father Ernest, the Episcopal priest who assisted Vilatte since 1887, wrote to the Door County Advocate that, regardless whatever Vilatte had said, nothing had been done \\"toward building a college elsewhere\\" since Brown's death \\"upset whatever may have been the plan\\". This project was never carried out and the land was returned to the donors.  Dyckesville  A second congregation, classified as an \\"unorganized mission\\" in the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac, was established in 1888 with Vilatte designated as the missionary priest taking charge on . This was called the St. Mary's mission, Dykesville (Duvall). By , less than two years after his Sturgeon Bay seminary scandal, a church, √ó, and a parsonage, √ó, was completed, located on of land including a cemetery. The Independent reported that Gauthier sailed to Europe where he would be ordained and that Vilatte received a letter from Heykamp \\"informing him that an [O]ld [C]atholic bishop will in a short time be selected to take charge of the [C]hurch in this country.\\" He later received a gift of over 100 antique theology books, \\"many of them are more than two centuries old\\", from Heykamp and Jacobus Johannes van Thiel, of the Old Catholic seminary in Amersfoort. Grafton attempted to remove Vilatte from the St. Mary's mission in 1891. Herzog and Reinken's investigation concluded that Vilatte was an Episcopalian, according to Marx and Blied, Herzog wrote to Vilatte on and \\"ended his letter bluntly: 'I want to have nothing more to do with you'.\\" An anthology of correspondence excerpts was published, , as Ecclesiastical Relations between the Old Catholics of America and Foreign Churches in response to an 1892 Second International Old Catholic Congress resolution. In Marx and Blied's opinion, this compilation was probably edited by Vilatte.  Russian Orthodox  Isolated from both the Episcopalians and the Old Catholics, Vilatte turned once again to another denomination. The text of a widely republished and translated 1891 document, purportedly from the Russian Orthodox Church through Bishop Vladimir Sokolovsky of San Francisco and Alaska, announced Vilatte's conversion from an Old Catholic confession of faith to an Old Catholic Orthodox confession of faith under Russian Orthodox Church patronage. It also declared that only the Holy Synod of the Russian Church or Sokolovsky can prohibit or suspend Vilatte's religious functions; and, states that any action contrary to the declaration is null and invalid, based on the liberty of conscience and unspecified United States law but without mention of Russian Orthodox Church canon law. Sokolovsky \\"appears to have granted him some form of recognition\\", according to Brandreth. In 1891, Sokolovsky visited Vilatte at the St. Mary's mission. Margrander wrote that Sokolovsky intervened, approved Vilatte's confession of faith and his official acts, and referred him to the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church. He \\"found himself unable to accept these communities and permit the continued use of the Roman Catholic rites and customs.\\" Sokolovsky was removed, soon after, in the wake of a series of scandals. Harding also corresponded with Russian General Alexander Kireev. However, \\"owing to the constitution of the Russian Church, Vilatte could not hope to obtain the episcopate from that source, or at least not without great difficulties.\\" While waiting for the Russian Holy Synod's decision, Vilatte also consulted with Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church Bishop Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares. Alvares offered to come to America and consecrate him bishop; Vilatte responded that he would travel to Ceylon. Anson believed that Vilatte did not want Alvares to realize the diminutive size of the schism. After months of waiting for a decision from the Russian Holy Synod, Vilatte sailed to Ceylon to receive the offered episcopate.  Malankara Orthodox Syrian  Susan Bayly wrote, in Saints, Goddesses and Kings, the St. Thomas Christians were by the 1880s fragmented and included a \\"bewildering array\\", based mostly on Christian evangelicalism, of \\"wildfire sects, breakaway churches and messianic Christian guru figures\\"; and, unlike in the past, they were then shunned as ritually polluting by caste Hindus. There was, and still is, a caste system among Indian Christians. To gain group status, they engaged in mass conversion campaigns, with a goal of increased adherents with maintained caste affiliation of the converts. For example, according to Bayly, baptized low caste Christians were \\"hived off into separate churches of their own\\" and not permitted to worship together. According to Robert Frykenberg, in Missions and Empire, there are at least six identified communities which claim apostolic tradition that are the historic Saint Thomas Christians. Writing about the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church prior to its regaining Catholicity, William Richards wrote, in The Indian Christians of St. Thomas, that their history shows a constant effort to obtain bishops, of Syrian descent, in communion with the Holy See. Finally, in 1896, three Roman-Syrian priests were consecrated as titular bishops, and sent to Travancore and Cochin as vicars apostolic. All the Roman-Syrians are under these Metrans and they use the Syriac language in their churches. This is not the denomination that consecrated Vilatte. Goanese schism in British Ceylon The denomination that consecrated Vilatte was a part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church that had a Latin Rite patrimony. V. Nagam Aiya wrote, in Travancore State Manual, that Alvares \\"describe[d] his Church as the Latin branch of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch.\\" Here, the surname Alvares is spelled Alvarez. The Holy See sought to consolidate two co- existing jurisdictions, the Padroado jurisdiction and the Congregation for Propagation of the Faith jurisdiction. As part of the transition, churches served by Goan Catholic priests remained under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of the East Indies until 1843. Later, this transition was delayed and extended until . In British Ceylon, it ended in 1887 with the appearance of a papal decree that placed all Catholics in the country under the exclusive jurisdiction of the bishops of the island. That measure met resistance. Alvares and Dr. Pedro Manoel Lisboa Pinto founded in Goa, Portuguese India, an association for the defense of the Padroado. Then, according to G. Bartas, in ', they complained that the new diocese and vicariates, were headed, almost exclusively, by European prelates and missionaries, and petitioned the Holy See for the creation of a purely native hierarchy. Bartas did not state if there was a response, but wrote that Alvares settled the difficulty by reinventing himself as the head of his schism, appearing on Ceylon, and settling into the main old Goan Portuguese churches in the village of Parapancandel. Here, the surname Alvares is spelled Alvarez. Alvares was a Roman Catholic Brahmin. Aiya wrote that Alvares, an educated man and the editor of a Catholic journal, was a priest in the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Goa. Failing to maintain amicable relations with the Patriarch of the East Indies, Alvares left the and joined Mar Dionysius the Metropolitan in Kottayam who consecrated Alvares as bishop. Later, he returned with title of Alvares Mar Julius Archbishop of Ceylon, Goa and the Indies, and involved about 20 parishes in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jaffna and in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Colombo on the island in his schism. Consecration According to Marx and Blied, \\"several shady characters claim to have given him the information\\" about Alvares but Brandreth and others attribute Harding as the source. Vilatte \\"never had a sizable income\\" according to Marx and Blied but could accumulate money for travel. For example, the people of Dykesville donated $225 for his journey. and being elected bishop by his small flock (according to the records of the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac, Vilatte had about 500 adherents), Vilatte sailed to Ceylon. There Alvares and two other Jacobite bishops consecrated him with the permission of the Patriarch of Antioch as Timotheos I, Jacobite Old Catholic Bishop of North America on 29 May 1892; attested to the consecration. When news of this reached North America the excommunicated Vilatte.  Archbishop  After an investigation forced him to wait nine months on the island, Bishop Alvares, Bishop Athanasius Paulos of Kottayam and Bishop St. Gregorius Gewargis of Niranam consecrated Vilatte to the episcopate in 1892 and named him \\"Mar Timotheos, Metropolitan of North America\\", probably with the blessings of Syriac Orthodox Church Patriarch Ignatius Peter IV. Grafton thought they were deceived by Vilatte statements as to his relation to Grafton and the extent of his work. There are claims that nobody has ever seen the original Syriac language form of this document. According to Brandreth, no Syraic authority had authenticated the signatures depicted in a photostatic copy of a purported translation of the Syraic document. √âmile Appolis wrote, in ', that Vilatte was titled \\"Old Catholic Archbishop of Babylon\\" (') and his cachet was an archiepiscopal cross, with the motto '‚Äîfrom the east, light. Likewise, Vignot included an excerpt, of Georges Aubault de la Haulte-Chambre description of Vilatte, from La Connaissance, in which Vilatte was also called the \\"Old Catholic Archbishop of Babylon\\". For its part, the Episcopal Church, on , having already degraded from the priesthood and excommunicated Vilatte, stated in its General Convention of the same year that it did not recognize his consecration as it took place in a Monophysite sect which does not accept the dogmas of the Council of Chalcedon. The Episcopal Church bishops declared Vilatte's episcopal orders to be void. The work in the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac has gone on, Grafton had three parishes under three priests, where the Old Catholic services were continued. In all this difficult matter, Grafton consulted his Presiding Bishop and followed his counsel; they did not wish to further a scheme which would make Vilatte a bishop, nor did they wish to offend the Old Catholics of the Netherlands. Williams believed they had saved the Episcopal Church from what might have become a great scandal. Returning to America and to his work in Door County, he ultimately moved to Green Bay, where he erected his '. During this time, Vilatte used two church buildings: St. Joseph's church in Walhain, and St. Mary's mission in Dykesville. He no longer used the Precious Blood mission which belonged to the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac. A request was sent from Bishop Sebastian Gebhard Messmer of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, Wisconsin, to the Premonstratensian abbot of Berne Abbey in Heeswijk, Netherlands, for priests needed to minister to the Belgian and Dutch settlers involved in Vilatte's schism; beginning in 1893, priests whose special mission would be to minister to their spiritual needs were sent. Vilatte \\"did not give up without a struggle\\" and \\"[n]umerous letters from him are in the archives of St. Norbert Abbey, some of them of a threatening nature, all giving indirect testimony to the fact that the early Norbertines were successful in stemming the tide of [...] doctrines and religious practices which were disturbing the peace of the Catholic Belgians on the peninsula.\\" The missionaries succeeded, according to Kirkfleet, by \\"appealing to the native Catholic instinct of the Belgians rather than by refuting the doctrines of the apostate.\\" In 1893, Vilatte had a booth at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, although he was not an invited delegate. Carlos Parra wrote, in Standing with Unfamiliar Company on Uncommon Ground, that \\"Despite the spectrum of religious traditions and theological views displayed at the Parliament, not everyone was welcome as a delegate. John Barrows emphatically stated that 'the Parliament was rigidly purged from cranks. Many minor sects, however, tried earnestly to secure a representation, for which there was neither time nor fitness'.\\" Vilatte was not invited. Barrows wrote, in The World's Parliament of Religions, that people sought unsuccessfully to use the parliament for propaganda. According to Parra, \\"a character like Vilatte embodied the worst possible nightmare about religious indifferentism for a Catholic mind. As a result, he was kept at the margins of the Parliament.\\" He did not take an official part in it. At this time, Vilatte began his dalliance with Polish Roman Catholics who, dissatisfied with non-Polish Roman Catholic priests, sought to set up an independent Catholic church at the urgings of the priests and Franciszek Hodur.  Green Bay  On , Vilatte bought land and built a small frame structure, his cathedral dedicated to St. Louis IX of France, in the city of Green Bay that year. Later that year, the first convention of the American Catholic Church (1894) (ACC1894) appointed Vilatte as its ecclesiastical head \\"without arbitrary powers\\". Constantine Klukowski wrote, in History of St. Mary of the Angels Catholic Church, Green Bay, Wisconsin, 1898‚Äì1954, that the 1894 Green Bay city directory lists Vilatte's cathedral \\"as 'American Catholic and its officials as: Vilatte, archbishop metropolitan and primate; , vicar general; Stephen Kaminski, consultor; and, Brother Nicholas, church manager. In 1895, C. Basil, SPB, was listed as rector of St. Louis's cathedral. During this time, Vilatte used three church buildings: St. Louis's cathedral in the city of Green Bay, St. Joseph's church in Walhain, and St. Mary's mission in Dykesville. He no longer used the Precious Blood mission which belonged to the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac. Shortly thereafter, reduced to penury, Vilatte traveled the East Coast offering the sacraments to, and soliciting monetary aid from, Episcopalians and Roman Catholics, but was rebuffed; in some places he was driven away by the Franco-Belgian Catholics. Vilatte sought a second time, , to reconcile with the . In March 1894 he approached Archbishop Francesco Satolli, Nuncio to the United States, who wrote to Messmer that Vilatte wished to reconcile; the next month, Vilatte wrote to Messmer that he was preparing his people for reconciliation. More correspondence took place between Satolli, Messmer and Vilatte. Later that year, the offered to pay the expense of Vilatte's journey to Rome. His case dragged on for almost four years until, in 1898, Satolli wrote to Messmer that Vilatte was ready to reconcile. But Vilatte remained indecisive. Messmer \\"realized that there was no hope for a sincere conversion\\" and wrote to Satolli: In 1898, the name was changed from St. Louis cathedral to St. John church and A. A. Mueller was listed as rector. On , Vilatte signed over his cathedral church to the company which foreclosed on him; it sold the church to Messmer on the next day. Messmer's dedication of the church as St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa Church, which took place about two weeks later, included a procession accompanied by a city marching band. Marx and Blied did not state the disposition of St. Joseph's church but wrote St. Mary's mission was lost at the same time. \\"Vilatte's cathedral was never known as Blessed Sacrament cathedral, as some claim\\", wrote Klukowski. Another mission was founded in Green Bay; it became the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in 1908 and a priest ordained by Koslowski was placed in charge. During this time he consecrated Kaminski and voyaged to Europe where he stop at Llanthony Abbey, to ordain Joseph Leycester Lyne, and \\"explained that he was in a hurry, on his way to Russia at the special invitation or the Holy Synod of Moscow\\" but that was improbable. In early 1899, he was in Rome and most Catholic newspapers reported that he sought reconciliation with the instead of union with the . Messmer disclosed that \\"Vilatte had admitted to him personally that he had never been in good faith\\" and both Messmer and Katzer advised the Holy Office to delay passing judgement on his orders to test his sincerity. A Congregation of the Holy Office Consultor, Father David Flemming, issued Vilatte's abjuration statement and a Roman Curia official, Bishop John Joseph Frederick Otto Zardetti wrote to Messmer that Flemming had the case under control. He made a \\"solemn recantation of his errors\\" , but, according to Weber, he \\"relapsed within a short time\\" after he outwardly reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church. Vilatte disagreed with authorities in Rome and as a result did not return to the ; authorities would not recognise him as a licit bishop. He did not take a solemn vow of abjuration and was not reconciled with the for second time. By early 1900, Vilatte was in the Benedictine Ligug√© Abbey, near Poitiers. \\"He appears to have told\\" the monks that he wanted to make a careful study of ordinations in the Syro-Malabar Church, so that he could convince the authorities in Rome of the validity of his episcopate. Aubault wrote a picturesque description of when, in the monastery, he met Joris-Karl Huysmans and Vilatte. While living as a guest of the Benedictines of Poitiers, Vilatte did not cease his subversive, anti-Catholic activities, although conducted secretly. News of this reached Cardinal Fran√ßois-Marie-Benjamin Richard, Archbishop of Paris, who, on 17 April 1900, circulated a warning among his clergy to be on their guard against men who claimed to be ordained or consecrated by Vilatte.  Emery colony  The Advocate in Sturgeon Bay reported , that Vilatte, living in Green Bay, had bought of land in Price County, Wisconsin, and planned to erect a church and a monastery. \\"It is his plan to found a colony of his people about the church as a center, the immigrants to come from Germany, Switzerland and portions of this country. [...] He expects to begin operations right away and will have fifty families, in the colony before winter.\\" Soon, according to the Milwaukee Journal, a Milwaukee German language newspaper printed a letter from Messmer warning people that women were soliciting funds using Messmer's and Katzer's names without authorization. They were seen and reported; when police arrived, \\"the priest who accompanied the sisters was called before the chief and questioned and cautioned as to obtaining money by any misrepresentations\\", according to the Milwaukee Journal. Vilatte felt the incident may have \\"left some wrong impressions\\" as they solicited funds, for developing the of forest, near Emery, Wisconsin; as Vilatte noted, all within of a logging road. \\"These sisters were in Milwaukee last week soliciting aid for the asylum, and in some quarters were denounced as frauds\\", he said. Then, similar to how the Sturgeon Bay seminary scandal began in 1887, he added, \\"we shall begin active operations within the next month\\" although \\"plans for the buildings have not been entirely completed as yet.\\" He envisioned, \\"[t]he purpose of the church is to found a monastery\\" as an \\"agricultural brotherhood of the Old Catholic Church\\" with a seminary, and an orphanage to bring children \\"up to agricultural pursuits\\". A real estate agent working for the Wisconsin Central Railway added that, during his negotiations with Vilatte he visited his \\"large and flourishing congregation\\" in Green Bay. The agent said they purchased \\"fine agricultural land\\" covered with hardwood forest. Less than six months later, his diocese lost possession of its foreclosed cathedral.  Chicago  Vilatte acquired U.S. citizenship then returned to the United States. He settled in Chicago in 1902, and used a mission begun by Father Francis Kanski as his next permanent '. Vilatte used, among other publications, nontrinitarian Jehovah's Witnesses publications for his religious education; in a letter attributed to him, in Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence, he said: \\"I do certainly believe that the 'little flock' will be an instrument by whom all the families of earth will be blessed; because all the churches are in a very poor situation and the world in great desolation.\\"Reprint of  Consecrations  Vilatte's \\"unilateral arrogation of status as an Old Catholic prelate did not, [...] reflect objective fact\\", according to Laurence Orzell, in Polish American Studies. The \\"European Old Catholics neither sanctioned his consecration nor approved of his attempt to spread Old Catholicism to America.\\" After successive annual conferences of the priests and delegates from parishes, a proposal to elect a Polish suffragan bishop was approved, and in 1897 the convention chose Kaminski from Buffalo, New York. Kozlowski, a losing candidate from Chicago, called a second convention in Chicago, which elected him as bishop; Vilatte refused to recognise him. When Vilatte advised the Old Catholics against Kozlowski's consecration, his \\"ecclesiastical antics\\" were taken into account and they \\"probably regarded such advice as all the more reason to proceed with the consecration.\\" Kozlowski traveled to Europe, and, on Herzog, Gul, and Theodor Weber elevated Kozlowski to the episcopate in Bern. Although Vilatte adherents saw a conspiracy, according to Orzell, it remains unclear if Grafton actively promoted Kozlowski's consecration. Herzog, who ordained Vilatte, assured Grafton, in 1898, that \\"a desire to counter the French 'rouge' served as a major motive behind the Chicago priest's consecration\\" and asked Grafton to support Kozlowski and \\"develop friendly relations with him\\".  Stephen Kaminski  Kaminski was born in West Prussia. According to Wac≈Çaw Kruszka in ', Kaminski did not attend any college, but learned how to play the organ from a local organist. After leaving the army, he forged official documents for which he received a two-year prison term. Upon his release, he emigrated to the United States where he clung to various priests as an organist. He felt called to the religious life and joined the Franciscan order in Pulaski, Wisconsin, but was expelled and moved to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where he worked in various menial jobs. He was organist at the independent Sweetest Heart of Mary Church in Detroit, Michigan (which Vilatte consecrated in 1893) but later quarreled with and wrote in newspapers against the pastor, , and left. When Vilatte visited Kolaszewski, his vicar general, in Cleveland, Ohio, to dedicate the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church building and cemetery on , he ordained Kaminski. The dedication ceremonies were marred by a riot, caused by protesters in the streets, that included a stabbing and shooting. In 1895 Kaminski and a faction of his adherents occupied the Polish parish church of St. Paul, a Roman Catholic church of the Diocese of Omaha in South Omaha, Nebraska, where he conducted devotion \\"in his own way\\". Kaminski wounded a man and then shot at the altar to create the impression that he had also been shot at. Later that month, Kaminski was called \\"a Polish nationalist who posed as a priest\\" by Elia W. Peattie, in the Omaha World-Herald. She wrote that he \\"barricaded himself in the sanctuary and used firearms to retain control, wounding Xavier Dargaczewski and Frank Kraycki.\\" Peattie quoted in her article: \\"The priest, he say: 'I never leave this town till I see the bare bones of this church!' And he is seein' 'em!\\" It was rumored he started the fire that burned the church, at the end of that month, to a pile of rubble and ashes; Kaminski's faction damaged fire hydrants so there was no way to extinguish the fire. Kaminski was arrested. Kruszka described the Buffalo situation as being the same that took place in Omaha. He wrote that, in June 1894, that Alfons Mieczys≈Çaw Chrostowski's Jutrzenka, in Cleveland, printed that Kolaszewski and Wladyslaw Debski arrived in Buffalo to establish an independent parish. Hieronim Kubiak wrote, in The Polish National Catholic Church in the United States of America from 1897 to 1980, that the first independent parishes in the United States were organized by German, Irish, and French Catholics. A \\"pattern of a parish conflict\\" was already in place when Poles set up their independent parishes. Translation, with additional chapter, of \\"As long as the conflict continued, the parish most often divorced itself from the jurisdiction of the accused bishop and stood independent of him, which did not mean that the parish did not consider itself belonging to the Catholic Church symbolized by the Pope. In the division with the bishops, the parish kept very strictly to the rules of the norm of religious life, finding in it a further support for the rightness of their cause.\\" Return to the previous state of affairs, exist in isolation and then vanish, or create \\"a self-determined religious movement\\" are the three alternative results, according to Kubiak. According to Kruszka, the causes of this \\"social ulcer\\" can be found several years earlier when Poles began immigrating to Buffalo in large numbers. They had only one church prior to 1886; they built an additional church, without waiting for the permission of Bishop Stephen V. Ryan of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo, but a storm demolished it; they demanded another church and only under pressure from the Congregation for Propagation of the Faith was a second church built. Even so, there was by this time resentment and bitterness among the people which created prejudices against the clergy. That \\"social ulcer\\" burst in 1895 when a group demanded that Ryan relinquish ownership and management of their church; Ryan did not agree to the conditions, so the rebels schismed from the and organized an independent parish. Their parish did not develop at all, because everyone thought their pastor, Antoni Klawiter, was morally bankrupt. Klawiter eventually left, intent on reconciling with the , and Kaminski, who was according to Kruszka another notorious adventurer like Klawiter, replaced him. From 1896 until , Kaminski was pastor of Holy Mother of the Rosary Parish in Buffalo. According to Kruszka, Kaminski once counted under his jurisdiction a parish in Buffalo, a parish in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and a parish in Baltimore, Maryland. Kaminski failed to persuade Gul to raise him to the episcopate. Soon after, Kaminski was to be consecrated bishop by Vilatte, but this was delayed over the fee charged for consecration. It was deliberate and premeditated simony, the act of buying and selling an ecclesiastical office, Vilatte demanded money for the consecration but Kaminski did not have enough to give. Only after Vilatte was bankrupt and had sold his house and cathedral in Green Bay was he less demanding and agreed to consecrate Kaminski. Kaminski was consecrated, on , by Vilatte as suffragan bishop for those Polish priests and parishes which accepted Vilatte's doctrinal reforms. In the end, he received $100 in cash from Kaminski and promissory notes for a few hundred dollars more. Kaminski threatened to take Grafton to court after Grafton publicly criticized him. \\"Notices were sent out\\", according to Anson, that stated both Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore and Archbishop Sebastiano Martinelli, the apostolic delegate to the United States, \\"would assist at the ceremony. It is hardly necessary to add that neither of these prelates put in an appearance.\\" However, the new bishop fled the United States to Canada because of creditors. He was excommunicated by Rome and he abandoned Vilatte. Kaminski was consecrated after the 1889 establishment of the Old Catholic Churches' Union of Utrecht and its , \\"the orders of ' in general, and specifically those of [...] Kaminski, [...] and of all those consecrated by them, are not recognized, and all connections with these persons is formally denied\\" by the . On , Vilatte was excommunicated by Ignatius Peter IV for consecrating Kaminski in a way contrary to the canon law of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. Anson wrote that in his agreement with Alvares, Vilatte acknowledged that if he \\"deviated from their Canons and Rules, he would be subject to dismissal from the dignity of Metropolitan.\\" Bishops were consecrated by Vilatte \\"without authority\\" from the Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch, who \\"therefore does not recognize such consecrations or their derivative consecrations and ordinations.\\" For both Kaminski and Kozlowski, according to Kubiak, \\"their movements became isolated in the Polonia community, not so much because of the propaganda of the , but rather because of the public opinion negative assessment of the associations of Polonia toward the dissenters.\\" Kubiak wrote: Just before the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland and wider Revolution of 1905 in the Russian Empire, Stanislaw Osada, in Historya ZwiƒÖzku Narodowego Polskiego i rozw√≥j ruchu narodowego Polskiego w Ameryce P√≥≈Çnocne, wrote in the United States, that Russian agents endeavored to draw believers into Old Catholicism, not for faith but for \\"implanting in the womb of Catholicism\\" the basis for Polish discord, to facilitate the Russification of the Catholic Church. Kubiak quoted Osada: \\"There exists yet another danger, namely that in recent times the leaders of that movement (independent) quite unequivocally help spread among the Polish masses the slogans of the Revolutionary-Socialists.\\" From 1898 to 1911 he edited and published a weekly Polish newspaper Warta, an organ of his independent church. He died in Buffalo on . After his death, the Buffalo center of the independent movement ceased to exist and most of his parishioners affiliated themselves with the Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC), the Scranton center of the independent movement.  Paolo Miraglia  Paolo Vescovo Miraglia-Gulotti was a priest from Ucria, Sicily, who in 1895 was sent into Piacenza, in Northern Italy, to preach the May sermons in honor of Mary; there he was embroiled in a series of either scandals or conspiracies. He opened his , Chiesa Italiana Internationale Paulina Irby wrote, in National Review that it began in a former stable of an old palazzo with church furnishing principally provided by Mazzini's niece. His congregation had just that church, and \\"is spoken of contemptuously as the congregation of Signor Abbate's stable\\", she wrote, as the Abbate family own the palazzo. On , Miraglia, who resided in Piacenza but was a priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Patti, Sicily, was excommunicated for, what was called, his \\"incredible, audacious, and obstinant scandals which long troubled the Roman Catholic Diocese of Piacenza\\". That year, Nevin introduced in The Churchman the \\"modern Savonarola\\", Nevin wrote \\"he has placed himself under wise guidance, and will not be apt to do anything rashly or ignorantly\\" but failed to include any specifics. The following week, The Churchman only hinted at the secular side of that movement by publishing a story from Milan's Corriere della Sera which wrote: \\"The struggle is now not only religious, but civic. The partisans of the bishop will hear of no truce with the partisans of Miraglia, and whenever they can, remove them from the employments that they hold.\\" Within a year, on , he attended the 4th International Old Catholic Congress in Vienna. By 1900, two reformation groups in Italy elected bishops for their churches: one group in Arrone elected Campello as its bishop and the other group in Piacenza elected Miraglia as its bishop. Campello was licensed in 1883 by Bishop Abram Newkirk Littlejohn, of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, to work as a priest \\"wherever there may be lawful opportunity\\" for Campello's reformation efforts in Italy, and by that time, Nevin already knew Campello for many years. Campello was elected bishop by a synod of his church in 1893 and asked Herzog for consecration, who in turn brought Campello's case to the . The refused to consecrate Campello in 1901, according to Oeyen, \\"because of his limited number of baptisms and marriages and his close relationships with Anglicans, Methodists, and Waldenses\\". The Church of Utrecht thought Campello was to Protestant. Miraglia, by then a leader of reform in northern Italy, wrote to Vilatte regarding the movement and consecration. On , while the Holy See examined Vilatte's case, he consecrated Miraglia in Piacenza. Miraglia was a popular speaker known for his relations with Ferdinando Bracciforti, who represented Milanese liberal Protestantism. According to Smit \\"the orders of ' in general, and specifically those of [...] Miraglia, and of all those consecrated by them, are not recognized, and all connections with these persons is formally denied\\" by the . On , the Congregation of Universal Inquisition declared that major excommunication was incurred by both Miraglia and Vilatte. The next day, , the Alexandria Gazette reported that his anti-Catholicism offended the sensibilities of an American Methodist Episcopal Church in Rome that the \\"majority of the Protestant congregation interrupted\\" his discourse \\"with angry protests against his abuse of the pulpit and the police were finally called to prevent an open riot.\\" In 1901, Tony Andr√© Florence, in a report about the liberal movement in Italy presented to the International Council of Unitarian and Other Liberal Religious Thinkers and Workers in London, wrote that Miraglia's \\"desire to be at the head of a personal movement, after separating him from the Old Catholics whose ideas were akin to his, threw him suddenly into a false path.\\" His consecration by Vilatte \\"lost him the sympathy of many, and his profession of faith completed their disappointment.\\" Florence wrote that Miraglia's \\"reformatory movement, therefore, is now in suspense\\", after he was obliged to refuge abroad. While the reported, in The Times, that although the \\"discreditable incident\\" of Miraglia \\"having arrogated to himself the dignity\\" of bishop-elect and his consecration happened, the work of the \\"real bishop- elect\\", Campello, was going on independently, with headquarters at Rome.The Times (London). 1901-06-20. p. 7. . It is unclear if the two juxtaposed groups were concurrent factions of one movement. In 1904, the refused to recognize Miraglia's consecration as valid when he presented himself to the sixth International Old Catholic Congress in Olten, Switzerland. Here, the name Tichy is spelled Tichi and the name Vilatte is spelled Villatte. Already a convicted fugitive who evaded Italian justice, Miraglia was then involved with religious associations in France. For example, a parish church in Piedigriggio, Corsica, was confiscated by the government from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ajaccio and devolved to a religious association formed on . The parish's priest disappeared after he signed a declaration of adherence to the sect. From May, 1907, Jacques Forcioli, a Miraglia ordained priest working for that religious association, conducted schismatic services. In November, a lawsuit was filed by a replacement priest appointed to serve the parish by the Bishop of Ajaccio, against the mayor and Forcioli, demanding the restitution of the church. The court rendered a judgment which condemned the mayor, declared that religious association illegal, and ordered restoration of the property to the 's priest. Miraglia intended to ordain a priest for Christmas there; but he fled and evaded a French deportation order against him on Christmas Eve. A few days later Forcioli was arrested for stealing items from the church; the mayor and members of the sect were arrested for complicity. Fearing assassination, the mayor refused to implement the restitution on . Finally, the Court of Appeal in Bastia dismissed Forcioli and restored exclusive possession of the Piedigriggio church property back to the 's priest. On , La Croix emphasized that the scope of the Bastia decision was of special importance, not only because it was the first judgment on the subject, but also because of the principles of law it invoked. Vilatte and Miraglia united in a joint effort, and except for the brief interval, , when Vilatte unsuccessfully attempted to organize a religious association in France, their work had chiefly been in the Midwestern United States. According to Thomas E. Watson, in Watson's Jeffersonian Magazine, after being \\"arrested like a common criminal\\" Miraglia was deported from the United States, on , \\"as though he were [...] an enemy to society.\\" Two days before his deportation, the New York Times reported that Miraglia, \\"self-appointed head\\" of the Catholic Independent Church of Rome, was detained on Ellis Island \\"on the charge that he is an undesirable citizen\\" after being apprehended in Springfield, Massachusetts. He admitted that \\"while in Piacenza and Parma he served several terms and was heavily fined for libel, and while a professor at the Patti University he forged the signatures of [f]aculty to fake diplomas, which he sold to deficient students.\\" On , The Evening World reported that he was \\"charged with obtaining alms under false pretenses\\", after the Bureau of Charities went to his mission and \\"found only an empty shack\\", and arrested along with two of his alleged accomplices by detectives. While in court, a Deputy United States Marshal arrested him \\"on the charge of writing vicious letters\\" to a woman.  Others  Over the next few years Vilatte, according to Joanne Pearson in Wicca and the Christian Heritage, \\"carried on travelling and consecrating, truly a 'wandering bishop'\\". In the middle of 1903, Vilatte was back in South Wales and he raised Henry Marsh-Edwards, a former Anglican priest, to the episcopate with the title of Bishop of Caerleon. The next day both men consecrated Henry Bernard Ventham with the title of Bishop of Dorchester. The Church of England (CoE) found Marsh-Edwards to be \\"incapable of holding preferment\\" after he was required to \\"answer charges against his moral character.\\" Although Marsh-Edwards was married, Vilatte consecrated him as a bishop. Mandatory clerical celibacy was required by Old Catholics, according to Oeyen, in Switzerland until 1876, in Germany until 1878, and in the Union of Utrecht until 1922. Margrander explains that this third episcopal consecration, of Marsh-Edwards, conferred by Vilatte is noteworthy because the bishop-elect was not celibate; Vilatte's precedent was followed by Gul in consecrating Arnold Mathew several years later. Mathew, a former Roman Catholic priest who resigned and left the , was married by the . \\"It is probable\\", Anson noted, that Vilatte consecrated Carmel Henry Carfora in 1907. \\"But there is no documentary evidence\\", he added, of the event. Carfora, a Franciscan priest, was sent as a missionary from Italy to the United States where he fell into heresy. In 1913, Vilatte consecrated Victor von Kubinyi in South Bend, Indiana.  Frederick Lloyd  Frederick Ebenezer John Lloyd was elected coadjutor bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Oregon in 1905. Nelson Crawford wrote, in American Mercury, that some laity opposed Lloyd's election and sent a letter containing \\"numerous objections\\" to the hierarchy. The letter was influential and Lloyd withdrew his name from consideration. He was not confirmed and was not consecrated by the . In 1907, Lloyd was degraded from the priesthood by Bishop Cortlandt Whitehead of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh and converted to the that year. In 1909, he reverted to the . He was a member of the Illinois legislature. Vilatte's sect was incorporated in 1915 in Illinois under the name American Catholic Church (ACC); Old corporate names officially used by the corporation were \\"American Catholic Church\\", \\"Mercian Rite Catholic Church\\", and \\"The Orthodox Catholic Church of America\\". The current corporate name, in 2013, is \\"The American Catholic Church\\". Lloyd was an incorporator along with Vilatte and Ren√© Louis Zawistowski. Vilatte consecrated Lloyd later that year. At the conclusion of the service Vilatte said to Lloyd: He succeeded Vilatte as head of the in 1920. According to Brandreth, Lloyd proselytized and the spread of the was \\"largely due to his initiative.\\" Lloyd founded his Order of Antioch (OoA), which was, according to Douglas, a group for Anglican clergy who were ordained by Lloyd. According to Douglas, Lloyd created a \\"loose organization in which he was looked to as the central '\\" that consisted to a greater degree of \\"an underground client√®le of Anglican clergymen\\" who were members of the and to a lesser degree of churches. Douglas noted that the attracted \\"an appreciable, if not large, membership, which was diffused all over England\\" but did not include an estimate of its membership. Lloyd's assistant, John Churchill Sibley, who Lloyd consecrated in 1929, spread the , surreptitiously according to Douglas. From about 1928 until 1934, Lloyd and Sibley used Saint Sarkis' Armenian Apostolic Church in London. In 1934, the Armenian priest informed his hierarchy, after being apprised by Douglas, that the Syriac Orthodox Church had repudiated Vilatte's apostolic succession; the Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem then instructed its priest \\"to cease all relations with Sibley and the Order\\". Lloyd and Sibley together operated a parallel business entity, called the \\"Intercollegiate University\\" (IU), in which Lloyd was president and Sibley was chancellor. According to the 1924 Year Book of the Churches, \\"in order to establish a legal bond with the American Catholic Church\\", the College of Church Musicians (CoCM) was reorganized and incorporated as in Illinois.  George Alexander McGuire  George Alexander McGuire was an Antiguan and a baptized Anglican who graduated from a Moravian theological seminary and served as a Moravian Church pastor on Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. He was married and had one daughter. After he immigrated to the United States in 1894, during the nadir of American race relations, he was eventually ordained as a priest in the Episcopal Church. After various assignments, from 1905 he held \\"the highest position open to a black man serving the church within the United States\\" as Bishop William Montgomery Brown's archdeacon for colored work in the Episcopal Diocese of Arkansas. The General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America considered proposals for the creation of black bishops, either in missionary districts independent of local dioceses or as suffragan bishops of local dioceses. Brown, a proponent of social Darwinism, proposed that black people should be racially segregated into a separate denomination. Theodore Natsoulas wrote, in Journal of Religion in Africa, that McGuire wrote an addendum to a diocesan annual report which endorsed Brown's \\"Arkansas Plan\\". Hein and Shattuck point out that Brown later apostatized and became a Communist; his \\"extreme theological and social views\\" eventually led to his removal. As Brown's archdeacon, \\"under his own initiative, he attempted to enact Brown's plan\\" but, according to Bains, McGuire seemed to have preferred the alternative missionary districts plan and \\"was frustrated by the racism of the Episcopal Church\\". Natsoulas thought that McGuire \\"probably came away from Arkansas with the idea of an independent black church.\\" McGuire later received a Doctor of Medicine and served as rector in the United States and on Antigua. In New York, he joined Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and the African Communities League in 1919, and was elected its chaplain-general the next year. While affiliated for a short time with the Reformed Episcopal Church, when McGuire established the Church of the Good Shepherd, he and his congregation became part of the Independent Episcopal Church which was renamed the African Orthodox Church (AOC). According to David Hein and Gardiner Shattuck, in The Episcopalians, McGuire created the African Orthodox Church \\"along the lines of what the Conference of Church Workers and Brown had previously proposed.\\" Garvey did not want a hierarchical church like McGuire created. While Bains called it only \\"a brief period of estrangement\\" from Garvey, McGuire actually became involved in a rival organization, the African Blood Brotherhood for African Liberation and Redemption (ABB). According to Rochell Isaac and Louis Parascandola, in Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present, the was a Marxist communist and black nationalist secret society founded by Cyril Briggs in Harlem, New York. It was an African American self-defense \\"response to the violent race riots of the Red Summer of 1919\\" and the Ku Klux Klan. Parascandola called it a \\"secret paramilitary group\\". According to Isaac, much early history is not documented but she wrote it was inspired by the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Many of its leaders were Caribbean immigrants and its council joined Comintern. Briggs, editor of the Amsterdam News, was fired by that newspaper for his support of an \\"autonomous black nation within the United States\\". \\"The saw racism as an offshoot of capitalism and viewed Marxism as the solution to the race problem.\\" James Oneal wrote, in American Communism, that it, the , appeared some time in 1921 and was used to attract blacks to the Communist movement. McGuire, who had been active in the , according to Oneal, \\"became a prominent leader in the new organization.\\" Mark Solomon wrote, in The Cry Was Unity, it \\"enjoyed a burst of good fortune in the fall of 1921 when three leaders\\" including McGuire \\"bolted to the \\" but \\"did not widen its ideological appeal.\\" The \\"took great pains to demonstrate his legitimacy.\\" Natsoulas wrote that it \\"was important to its mission that the new church be founded on solid grounds\\" and quoted McGuire's words that \\"[t]he Negro everywhere must control his own ecclesiastical organization\\" yet hold the Apostolic traditions. He was refused consecration by Episcopal, Catholic, and Russian Orthodox bishops. About the same time, on , Vilatte consecrated McGuire. The , according to Solomon, contemplated a secret army with weapons \\"smuggled into Africa by men 'in the guise of missionaries, etc.' as a prelude to gradual liberation of the continent.\\" But, Jeannette Jones writes, in In Search of Brightest Africa, that the had a flawed understanding of missionaries because, in fact, the \\"colonial powers distrusted many black missionaries as race agitators.\\" By the end of 1923 the was no longer an \\"independent political organization\\" as it merged with the Workers Party of America; and, it was dissolved in 1925. McGuire believed that apostolic succession was \\"essential to authenticate the claims of the \\". According to Bains, however, \\"the questionable authenticity of Vilatte's consecrations haunted their relations with other churches.\\" For example, although three months after being raised to the episcopate, McGuire was granted an audience with Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople in New York City, but the \\"never gained the desired recognition from a major Eastern Orthodox Church.\\" Bains concluded that McGuire \\"remained a marginal figure in both the church and predominantly Protestant black America\\" even with his \\"claim to apostolic succession that few recognized.\\"  Ordinations   Edward Donkin  Edward Rufane Donkin was an infamous impostor with worldwide notoriety. He represented himself, at different times, as D Benedetto, Comte Benedetto Donkin, Lord , Benedict Donkin, the cousin of the Earl of Minto, the son of the Duke of Devon. \\"In the world's long roll of impostors a prominent place must always be found for 'the Right Rev. Edward Rufane Benedict Donkin, Bishop of Santa Croce, and Vicar Apostolic of the Independent Roman Catholic Church'\\", begins his obituary in Adelaide's The Chronicle, who committed \\"a series of frauds\\" resulting in several imprisonments. Vilatte ordained Donkin. Years later, in 1904, while he represented himself as an Old Catholic Church bishop, Donkin started \\"what [was] purported to be an Old Catholic Benedictine Oratory\\" in a house previously \\"occupied by genuine Benedictines\\" and \\"opened almost entirely on credit.\\" By August, \\"the bubble burst\\", Warren Fisher, who guaranteed the furnishings, discovered he had been swindled. Donkin \\"represented that he had been appointed by the Old Catholic Conference as their bishop at Oxford at a salary of ¬£400 a year and that he produced what purported to be the official record of his appointment.\\" Donkin induced him \\"to guarantee the bill for the furnishing of the Oratory\\" with a forged check and Fisher was left to pay his guarantee. Fisher then wrote to Vilatte, he responded, and Fisher forwarded his letter to Truth which published it. Vilatte wrote that when Donkin came to him in 1896, \\"he posed as 'The Rev Fr Dominic, OSA, Church of England Missioner, St Augustine's Priory, London,' and as such he was asked by the Protestant Episcopal clergy of Milwaukee to preach in their cathedral.\\" And, as Vilatte wrote, \\"I was completely blinded and did ordain him to the priesthood\\" but \\"[a]bout eighteen months afterwards his true character was discovered, and I deposed and degraded him\\". Vilatte explained that a member of his clergy, who he noted was also \\"humbugged and swindled\\", introduced him to the impostor, the alias Lord Cortenay, son of the Duke of Devon; that \\"he 'took in' the clergy of Milwaukee\\"; that \\"Donkin never belonged to any 'community' in our Church\\"; but, Vilatte did not explain why he ordained Donkin, who he thought was a cleric. Vilatte wrote that later Donkin \\"posed as a Bishop in Cleveland.\\" According to Smit \\"the orders of ' in general, and specifically those of [...] Donkin, [...] and of all those consecrated by them, are not recognized, and all connections with these persons is formally denied\\" by the .  Joseph Lyne  Vilatte first visited Frederick George Lee of the Order of Corporate Reunion. Lee gave Vilatte a letter of introduction to Lyne. While Vilatte traveled to Paris to consult with advisers, he interrupted his journey to ordain Joseph Leycester Lyne and another monk at the Anglican Llanthony monastery near Capel-y-ffin, Wales, and the ruins of Llanthony Priory; on , Lyne, an ordained deacon in the but \\"unable to receive orders in his own church\\" for over three decades, was ordained priest by Vilatte. Rene Kollar wrote, in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, that \\"for a time\\" Lyne \\"dreamed of establishing a British Old Catholic church.\\" Years earlier, in 1890‚Äì1891, while Lyne was on his tour of North America raising funds for his work in England, The Cambrian wrote that his order \\"is not a Catholic Order, nor a Church of England exactly, but an offshoot of the High Church movement associated with the idea of a revival of the [a]ncient British Church\\"‚Äîwhich Pearson calls a \\"literary fantasm\\"‚Äîand his abbey church conducts some services in Welsh. The Cambrian noted that had Lyne addressed the 1889 National Eisteddfod of Wales, in Brecon, on behalf of the Welsh language and of the Ancient British Church and also admitted a Druid, taking the bardic name Dewi Honddu, by the Archdruid David Griffith, also known by his bardic name Clwydfardd; and had spoken for the rights of the Ancient Welsh Church at the English Church Congress held at Cardiff, by the permission of the Bishop of Llandaff. Pearson argues that \\"concern with ancient, indigenous religions emerging and operating independently of the Church of Rome characterises the heterodox Christian churches of the in England, Wales and France\\" and \\"was a theme that was to influence the development of Druidry and Wicca.\\" She believes, based on accounts published during his tour of him being the \\"Druid of the Welsh Church\\" and \\"belonging to an Ancient British Church, older than any except Antioch and Jerusalem\\", Lyne may have been part of another , Richard Williams Morgan, recreated Ancient British Church, given its overtones of Welsh nationalism and links to neo- druidism.It was, according to Desmond Morse-Boycott, in Lead, Kindly Light, his accepting ordination \\"at the hands of a wandering [O]ld Catholic bishop, who was an adventurer\\" that discredited him with the which \\"denied him the priesthood\\". In 1909, after Lyne's death, two surviving Anglican monks, Asaph Harris and Gildas Taylor, were ordained, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where Vilatte was staying during a visit of his missions in that part of North America. Both monks eventually joined the Benedictines of Caldey Island where Aelred Carlyle was Abbot and later Anson was a member.  William Brothers  Grafton was a founding member of the Society of St. John the Evangelist who \\"had strong ideas about the importance of communities of men and their significant contributions to the church\\" and his \\"influence on the growth of the religious life\\", according to Rene Kollar on Project Canterbury, \\"extended across the Atlantic\\". Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax, wanted Grafton to install Carlyle as abbot of the monastic community living as guests on Halifax's estate in Painsthorpe. On his return travel from Russia in 1903, Grafton visited Halifax in Painsthorpe where he installed Carlyle and ordained him a subdeacon; and the next year, 1904, Grafton ordained Carlyle a priest during a secret but officially documented ceremony in Ripon, Wisconsin. Both Carlyle and Grafton wanted to establish an Anglican Benedictine brotherhood in Grafton's diocese. Several men expressed an interest, but Anson wrote that Brothers was not among a few Americans at Carlyle's monastery. It is unclear what happened next but, according to Kollar, Carlyle's involvement stopped in 1904. \\"Apparently little or no contact existed between Carlyle's brotherhood and his American counterpart\\", noted Kollar. By 1908, Father Herbert Parrish, a priest in good standing, was prior of the Anglican Benedictine monastery of St. John the Baptist in Fond du Lac. Anson wrote, in The American Benedictine Review, that after Parrish left, it \\"appears that his followers were replaced or displaced by a group of young men who had been formed into a Benedictine brotherhood\\" by Brothers in Waukegan, Illinois, located outside Grafton's Diocese of Fond du Lac. A \\"rented-house was named St. Dunstan's Abbey\\" with Grafton self-appointed as \\"their absentee Abbot\\"; it was not a monastery listed in the Living Church Annual. According to Anson, Vilatte ordained Brothers and later deposed him. Anson was not certain whether this group was an Anglican religious order, \\"for by 1911 they were styling themselves 'Old Catholics'\\". Brothers' group, of about five members, was brought into the remaining part of the , then under the jurisdiction Bishop Jan Tichy in 1911. Brothers was consecrated by Bishop Rudolph de Landas Berghes in 1916 and later deposed by him, for what \\"appears to have been\\" to Brandreth, \\"on the grounds that at the time of the consecration he had not, in fact, received the Orders of deacon and priest.\\"  Other ordinations  On , Vilatte ordained Louis-Marie-Fran√ßois Giraud, an excommunicated Roman Catholic Trappist monk, for dabbling in magic and the occult. Shortly after Giraud's ordination, Cardinal Fran√ßois-Marie-Benjamin Richard, Archbishop of Paris, warned about apostate priests who were celebrating Mass under cover of a religious association directed by Vilatte. Richard said, He then excommunicated Vilatte a second time.  St John's Home  Vilatte operated a private home for the care of homeless children, St John's Home, in Chicago since 1897. Claude Basil, known as \\"Father Basil\\", was in charge of this institution until three indictments, charging \\"crime against nature\\", were found against him by the Cook County, Illinois grand jury in June 1903. The indictments were based on accusations of three boys who formerly lived in the home. Basil was arrested. An inspector from the State Board of Charities investigated the home on , after the St John's Home applied to the Illinois Secretary of State for incorporation. According to the report, the inspector went to the given address and found the house vacant but upon inquiry was directed to a different location. A new two story frame building with modern conveniences was found at that address. Vilatte was in charge and assisted by two other men, \\"Father Francis\\" and \\"Brother Panchand\\"; the signatures of all three men appear on the incorporation application. \\"He informed me that the home was organized in 1897, and that its object is to help poor children who have no homes, no matter what religious denomination they belong to, and that the institution is supported entirely by donations and collections.\\" They cared for eighteen children‚Äî17 boys and a girl, the sister of three boys. The inspector recommended that the girl, probably 7 or 8 years old, should be taken out of the home, which had no provision for the separation of the sexes, and placed elsewhere. Furniture was moved in the day before the inspection, and consequently the home was in disorder, but the inspector noted the floors woodwork walls and ceiling appeared to be clean. Vilatte informed him that a doctor was immediately called in case of sickness. The children wore donated clothing and all those of school age attended the public school. Two boys were locked in rooms and the inspector was told by Vilatte that \\"they were doing penance for running away\\". The report includes part of an 1898 letter from Grafton, about Vilatte's character, published in Diocese of Fond du Lac, a newspaper. Grafton warned about Basil in that letter: To further discredit Vilatte in that letter, which Orzell calls one of his \\"more vituperative public pronouncements concerning\\" Vilatte, Grafton also asserted \\"he was morally rotten; a swindling adventurer [...] reported to me for drunkenness, swindling, obtaining money under false pretenses and other crimes, and as a notorious liar\\" with \\"somewhat exceptional gifts as an imposter\\" and associated with questionable people: Vilatte stated that Basil no longer had a connection with the home at the time of inspection. The board did not find conditions sufficiently favorable to warrant recommending for the St John's Home incorporation; the board recommended that articles of incorporation be withheld by the Secretary of State. He was tried on one of these indictments and found guilty of a \\"crime against nature\\" on . At the time of the report, he was held in jail while his appeals pended. The Secretary of State declined to incorporate St John's Home. Basil requested \\"friends and acquaintances\\" back in Sturgeon Bay to send financial contributions, to Vilatte, for his appeal.  Des Houx  In 1904 diplomatic relations between the French Third Republic and the Holy See were broken. Also: In 1905 all Churches were separated from the State and authorized to form self-supporting corporations for public worship. Those religious associations () were designations given to certain \\"moral persons\\" or associations which, by the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, the French Third Republic, wished to incorporate in each diocese and parish to receive as proprietors church properties and revenues, with responsibility of taking care of them. They were based on the principle that the State should only recognize distinct religious associations, having corporate status, formed in each parish for the purpose of worship \\"in accordance with the rules governing the organization of worship in general\\". All buildings used for public worship were made over to the religious associations; in the absence of religious associations, buildings remain at the disposal of the clergy and worshipers, but an administrative act must be secured from the prefect or the mayor. By Article 8, it belonged to the Council of State, a purely lay authority, to pronounce upon the orthodoxy of any religious associations; the revenues were to be subject to state regulation. One such group was the work of Henri Durand-Morimbau, a publicist, better known under his pseudonym of Henri des Houx. Durand-Morimbau, a university agr√©g√©, first worked with Bishop F√©lix Dupanloup at the liberal newspaper La D√©fense. Pope Leo XIII realized the need of a papal journal through which he could communicate with the foreign press, and he consequently created Journal de Rome. Journal de Rome, inspired by the French Cardinal Jean Baptiste Fran√ßois Pitra and directed by des Houx, grew critical of Leo XIII liberal views. The New Zealand Tablet describing Journal de Rome, wrote that, it \\"distinguished itself for its fierce denunciations of the Italian Government and its equally fierce support, [...] of the Papacy.\\" In 1885, Pitra defended des Houx in an open letter but Journal de Rome did not fulfil Leo XIII's expectations and was closed. Des Houx then returned to Paris, where he became editor of Le Matin, a French daily newspaper, in which he retaliated with articles against the Pope and the Curia. In 1886, his memoir ' was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. But he returned to Leo XIII's favor by publishing, in 1900, '. By his , encyclical, ', Pope Pius X stated that the law threatened to intrude lay authority into the natural operation of the ecclesiastical organization; Georges Goyau explains, in the Catholic Encyclopedia, that the Holy See feared that religious associations would furnish the State with a pretext for interfering with the internal life of the Church, and would offer to the laity a constant temptation to control the religious life of the parish. ' prohibited the formation not only of these religious associations, but of any form of association whatsoever \\"so long as it should not be certainly and legally evident that the Divine constitution of the Church, the immutable rights of the Roman pontiff and of the bishops, such as their authority over the necessary property of the Church, particularly the sacred edifices, would, in such religious associations, be irrevocably and fully secure.\\" The ecclesiastical authority had forbidden the only kind of corporation which the State recognized as authorized to collect funds for purposes of worship or have the right of ownership for purposes of worship. The State considered previously legally-recognized churches, as no longer existing; and, in cases where no religious associations were incorporated, took over the property of the churches and turned the property over by decree to the charitable establishments of the respective municipality; in such cases, the Church lost this property forever. After the publication of the encyclical, des Houx supported a policy opposed to that which he held twenty years earlier in Rome. On , he started a press campaign, in Le Matin, titled: \\"France for the French\\" ('). He wrote that the hierarchy of the Catholic Church were unable to save either themselves or churches and the faithful French must now do so; des Houx appealed, to all the faithful, for the formation of a \\"League of French Catholics\\" ('), whose purpose was to preserve traditional worship churches, religious foundations and properties currently threatened by decommissioning of churches; the group mission was to facilitate the formation of religious associations. He wrote that the majority of bishops disguised their opinions and were forced to abdicate their conscience and their control; that priests were treated like dumb and terrified slaves; and, that they did not have the right to abdicate a wealth which was accumulated by the piety of their ancestors. By , L√©on Daudet ridiculed, in Libre Parole, what he calls des Houx's \\"'\\". The large circulation of Le Matin made the failed attempt widely known and drew public attention to the acts and the words of Vilatte; Le Matin and des Houx were unable to get people to take their religious association seriously. Vilatte was involved but could not keep des Houx's \\"French Catholic Church\\" viable, which des Houx had established in Paris, in the chapel of a former convent. By January 1907, des Houx wanted to create a schismatic Church in Paris and recruited Vilatte, though Vilatte was believed to be supported by Aristide Briand, the Minister of Cults and one of the leaders of the liberal anti-Roman movement. (Newspapers.com) At des Houx's insistence, Vilatte returned to Paris early in 1907. On , Washington Times- Herald translated Vilatte, from Le Petit Parisien, as saying to the French: \\"You are suffering, [...] but you do not know why you suffer, because you are not clear-sighted and practicalbecause you are not Americans. But I am an American, and I am the man you want to set things straight for you.\\" Vilatte together with a few laymen founded a religious association in the Church Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris that filed a demand to receive the church and its possessions. In the meantime he resided in the former Barnabite convent. A public Mass was partly celebrated in the convent chapel by Roussin, from the diocese of Toulouse, in the presence of Vilatte. Much disorder and tumult followed upon Roussin's appearance in the pulpit, which he was speedily forced to quit by missiles flung at him. Vilatte tried to quell the storm from the sanctuary but was also obliged to retreat. The religious association was \\"founded at the instigation of the Masonic government officials\\", according to Kirkfleet. Vilatte's , excommunication by the was renewed on . Roussin eventually returned to the . Around the same time, he was involved in another scandal. If Vilatte did not exist, wrote Snob, in Le Rire, he would have to be invented for the lenten vaudeville foolishness played out in his church; he satirized the incident of a bailiff, who, in the name of a woman who loaned 3,000 francs to Vilatte, presented himself at the chapel and seized Vilatte's personal belongings, including his miter and crosier. He wrote of Vilatte's humiliation‚Äînot even having a miter to put on his head. While the bailiff searched for property to seize, he also found embarrassment and shame; the church porter had brought a fourteen-year-old girl, whom he had met on the boulevards during Mardi Gras, into his room above the chapel. Snob ended his satire with the sentence: \\"Desolation of the desolation!\\" The law was modified by a law passed , permitting exercise of religious worship in churches purely on sufferance and without any legal title; and further by a law passed , classifying assemblages for religious worship as public meetings, and abolishing in respect of all public meetings the anticipatory declaration required by the Law of 1881 which the refused to make. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, by the end of 1908, the in France, stripped of all her property, was barely tolerated in her religious edifices. Appolis underscores that, ultimately, without the patronage of even a single French episcopate and only a very small number of schismatic priests in service, the \\"League of French Catholics\\" completely failed. It is significant that the modernists, active at that time, paid no attention to the religious associations movement, according to Appolis. He concludes that, while Briand was initially hostile toward religious associations, he later only used them for a short time as a \\"machine of war\\" against the Holy See but saw little result and abandoned them. By 1920 diplomatic relations between the French Third Republic and the Holy See, broken in 1904, were resumed. This method was used until 1923 when a new method of administering church properties was inaugurated.  Vilatteville, Mexico  Vilatte was involved in at least three speculative real estate ventures near the Rio Grande. In each venture he sought out customers who would travel to and settle on land purchased from the venture. In 1906, according to articles published in The Donaldsonville Chief and The Brownsville Daily Herald, settlers could purchase or plots of land from a tract that a venture had planned to purchase near Raymondville, Texas. The Brownsville Daily Herald wrote that Vilatte traveled in a private railroad car with several investors. A. M. Davidson, a general immigration agent at Chicago for the Houston and Texas Central Railway, purchased of land and the Brownsville Railroad donated more, on which a monastery was planned, at the center of the planned settlement. Vilatte recruited settlers; one article said he would select the settlers and \\"see to it that no undesirable immigrants are brought in.\\" He began calling himself \\"Archbishop Vilatte, of Texas\\". In 1910, with a group of Society of the Precious Blood religious, led by Taylor, who had joined the society after his ordination, Vilatte went to Candelaria, Texas. From there, they crossed the Rio Grande to an area in the vicinity of San Antonio El Bravo in Mexico where they founded, on 18 July, a cooperative settlement called Vilatteville located on in the Chihuahuan Desert. Vilatte felt it was a blessing to live there. He wrote: According to an article published in the El Paso Herald, only actual settlers could purchase or plots of land along with in the town of Vilatteville from what was described as a \\"back to the soil\\" settlement on land the venture purchased in northern Chihuahua, Mexico. On , Vilatte sailed to Europe to recruit settlers. Unfortunately for the settlement, the Mexican Revolution also started in 1910. After Porfirio D√≠az was ousted from power and exiled in France, Abraham Gonz√°lez, Governor of Chihuahua, redistributed the settlement as part of nationalization and agrarian land reform in Mexico. Taylor stayed in Chihuahua for a few years where, according to Anson, \\"he worked with schismatic clergy who were being sponsored by Vilatte as a nucleus of a national church.\\" Vilatteville was a precursor of Mexican schisms. Although Joaqu√≠n P√©rez's 1925 Mexican Catholic Apostolic Church (') (ICAM) was dismissed as a \\"comic opera reformation\\" sponsored by Plutarco El√≠as Calles, Matthew Butler notes, in The Americas, that previously other schisms were attempted such as by Venustiano Carranza's revolutionaries and that Vilatteville was built in Chihuahua about 15 years before. It's unclear from Butler if Vilatteville influenced Mexican schisms but Butler wrote that P√©rez was consecrated by Carfora. Other groups also conducted operations in Mexico. Cross wrote that before the First Vatican Council, \\"the American Episcopal Church had supported dissident Catholics in Mexico. The reform mission of the American Episcopal Church, with its links to the , is closely related to the growth of American influence and empire.\\" In 1911, another venture was \\"Uncle Sam City\\", in Socorro County, New Mexico Territory, with the Ascott Valley Land and Improvement Company of El Paso, Texas. On at least . In a full-page advertisement, in the , issue of the El Paso Herald, the venture dubiously claims, among other things, that it \\"gives the first investors a 1000 percent profit within a few years\\" and \\"only an infinitesimal part of the water applied to lands in this valley is lost to evaporation\\" as well as \\"cattle are rarely afflicted with diseases\\".  Founding the American Catholic Church  The name \\"American Catholic Church\\" was used to identify more than one unique entity. Vilatte founded his independent Christian denomination, American Catholic Church (ACC), soon after he was consecrated. According to The New York Times, Edward Randall Knowles was Vilatte's first ordination. The 1892 article called the two, Vilatte and Knowles, the hierarchy of the . That had a schism when Knowles desired to be consecrated a bishop. Vilatte wrote to The New York Times, that he had \\"been pestered with applications from clergymen of other churches for episcopal consecration.\\" I \\"would render myself ridiculous\\", wrote Vilatte, \\"were I to proceed to consecrate Bishops in a hurry.\\" Vilatte rejected Knowles' request and Knowles resigned. Vilatte explained that three canonical conditions were not met: #Vilatte was alone, \\"and the law of the Church is that there should be at least three Bishops to consecrate another\\" #Knowles was married, \\"whereas in all the Eastern churches a Bishop must be a monk\\" #Knowles was too young, he \\"has not attained the canonical age\\" Vilatte complained against attempts to force him \\"to act against\\" his \\"better judgment\\" and declared: \\"I am, and intend to remain, faithful to the laws of our orthodox Church.\\" Vilatte was mocked, in The Sacred Heart Review, as being the \\"sole proprietor and General Manager of the new Old Catholic Church in America\\" confronted by a schism. While the \\"great 'neatness and despatch of Knowles' ordination was ridiculed and his judgment, for \\"resigning from his church because he can't be a bishop all at once\\", was questioned. \\"Knowles may ask, [what] is the use of having a [...] church of your own if you are going to let the rules stand in your way?\\". Knowles was a Baptist convert to the , he graduated from Princeton University, studied Christian Science for a time, interviewed Lyne, corresponded with Alvares, Pinto, Herzog and others. He was prepared to sail to Europe to consult with Loyson, Herzog, and the about the feasibility or desirability of starting missions in America. He abandoned his trip and waited for Vilatte. They met in Philadelphia, and Knowles was ordained in West Sutton, Massachusetts. On , The New York Times published that Knowles had received a letter from Loyson. \\"The letter shows that the Old Catholic Episcopate in Europe have sided with [...] Knowles as against [...] Vilatte, and have entirely repudiated him.\\" The name \\"American Catholic Church\\" was also used, from 1894, by a group of Polish parishes, at first associated with Vilatte, which were organized at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Cleveland. On , The New York Times reported that Knowles was a guest at Holland House, London and was \\"a priest of the Old Catholic or Syrian Church\\" who will in Egypt \\"study the Coptic and Greek systems\\". It further reported that, \\"There is a feeling among the Old Catholics and others who sympathize with them that the present administration of the Church is not vigorous or progressive enough. Hardly any advance has been made since the consecration of Archbishop Vilatte [...] Negotiations were carried on with disaffected Polish Catholics [...] but they failed [...] through a lack of discretion and tact.\\" It went on to report that the \\"facts will be laid before the Patriarch by Knowles\\" and that reforms will be suggested. \\"In point of fact\\", Orzell wrote, \\"most Polish dissidents proved more willing to make use of Vilatte's episcopal services at blessings and confirmations than to accept his leadership and embrace his curious blend of Eastern and Western Christian theology.\\" Margrander wrote that Poles did not accept Vilatte's doctrinal reforms so he withdrew his approval of their movement; he also wrote that Vilatte was convinced that their motive was a \\"deliberate defiance of the canonical authority\\" of their bishops, rather than reform, so he \\"advised them either to accept fully and freely the Old Catholic principles, or to return to the Roman Church.\\" Statistics about Vilatte's Old Catholic Church (OCC) sect showed its tiny size. Henry Carroll's The Religious Forces of the United States Enumerated, Classified, and Described, summarized United States Census data from 1890 to 1910. It showed the had at most three ministers, five edifices and 700 members; Moreover, the 1910 United States Census data showed that prior to 1910, the disintegrated and ceased to exist; Carroll wrote that \\"a number of denominations, all quite small, have disappeared, including [...] the Old Catholic Church, and other insignificant bodies.\\" Carroll's summaries did not list a sect named \\"American Catholic Church\\". Bishops of the American Catholic Church: Stephen Kaminski, Joseph Ren√© Vilatte, Paolo Miraglia *a council of churches open to all persons having their residence in this country, whatever may be their nationality; *united in the fidelity to the true faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the sole Head of the Universal Church and our High Priest; *imbued with the American Spirit of democracy and liberty; *a branch or section of the true (Christian) Catholic Church of God, with its own Synod and Conference of Bishops. Partially self-reported statistics about Vilatte's denominations were included in the United States Census Bureau's Religious Bodies, 1916 edition. They show two denominations associated with Vilatte were grouped under the name \\"Old Catholic Churches\\". The report identified similar types of denominations, though not ecclesiastically connected, as the and the Lithuanian National Catholic Church (LNCC). Of the two denominations under Vilatte's leadership, first reported in Religious Bodies, 1916 edition, the larger was the Old Roman Catholic Church (ORCC) with an episcopal see in Chicago. Miraglia was associated with this organization. It was in close fellowship with the but a distinct organization. Although some churches had been previously registered, the was not reported in Religious Bodies, 1906 edition. It claimed 12 organizations served by 14 ministers, with a membership of 4,700 with 11 church edifices and four parsonages. The organizations held church service mostly in foreign languages; principally Polish and Russian with others using Portuguese, Lithuanian, and English. Of the two denominations under Vilatte's leadership, first reported in Religious Bodies, 1916 edition, the smaller was the with an episcopal see in Chicago. It was incorporated in 1915 in the State of Illinois. Lloyd was associated with this organization. The denomination was formed for the special purpose of bringing Roman Catholics into the Old Catholic movement. It was in close fellowship with the but a distinct organization. It claimed three organizations served by seven ministers, with a membership of 475 with one church edifice and one parsonage. The organizations held church service only in English. After Vilatte retired as head of the in 1920, Lloyd was chosen by a synod of that church to replace him; that synod gave Vilatte the honorary title of Exarch. According to the Year Book of the Churches, 1923 edition, Vilatte continued as head of the . Also After Vilatte's death, only one denomination derived from Vilatte was included in Religious Bodies, 1926 edition, in the report's Old Catholic Churches group. Religious Bodies explained that, by then, \\"none of these American bodies or leaders are connected with or recognized by the Old Catholic Churches of any part of continental Europe, nor are their Orders or Apostolic Successions derived directly, if at all, from European Old Catholic Churches\\" and added a \\"caution against misinterpretation\\" of the term \\"Old Catholic Churches\\". It identified the and \\"its numerous derivatives\\" as one of three subsets of denominations in the Old Catholic Churches group. According to Religious Bodies, these entities are no longer either connected with Old Catholic Churches of continental Europe, which \\"repudiated all responsibility for or connection with\\" bishops who derived their consecrations from the consecration of Mathew, or with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. \\"Of the many bishops that have been consecrated in this group, [...] most have assumed other names and titles and founded separate churches for themselves by civil incorporation. For most of these no statistics are published, for the reason that the Census Bureau collects its statistics directly from congregations rather than from the officers of corporations.\\" So, \\"direct comparisons between the bodies as reported at the two censuses are impossible, [...] because of numerous organic changes\\", according to the United States Census Bureau. Which also stated \\"a reorganization since the census of 1916 makes it impossible to identify the whole group with any of the bodies formerly presented\\", in the 1916 data, under the name \\"Old Catholic Churches\\"; the reorganized claimed 11 organizations served by an unreported number of ministers, with a membership of 1,367 with two church edifices and one parsonage. A 1938 notice from the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East concerning schismatic bodies and ', states that \\"after direct expulsion from official Christian communities\\" some schismatic bodies exist, including \\"all the sects claiming succession through Vilatte\\", that claim \\"without truth to derive their origin and apostolic succession from some ancient Apostolic Church of the East\\" and The notice named the specifically as an example of such schismatic bodies. According to James R. Lewis, in The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions, the \\"was taken over by bishops with theosophical leanings\\" after Vilatte's death.  Reconciliation and death  The ', printed that Vilatte returned to France in 1922 with dollars. What is certain, according to Appolis, is that money assisted in the election of the socialist Cartel des Gauches during the 1924 French legislative election. Vilatte had friends in the new majority. In 1925, he returned to France for the last time. \\"It is possible\\", Anson wrote, that he hoped that Giraud or Jean Bricaud \\"would befriend him as the virtual founder of their sects.\\" Following the election, the was very concerned about the outbreak of anticlericalism that accompanied the new majority. After conferring with Pope Pius XI and his Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, Father Eug√®ne Pr√©vost was given the task of obtaining Vilatte's abjuration. Pr√©vost quickly succeeded. On , La Croix reported that Vilatte took a solemn vow of abjuration at the hands of Archbishop Bonaventura Cerretti, Apostolic Nuncio to France, in Paris on ; and published his abjuration text. Vilatte wrote: A week later newspapers announced that Vilatte, with an American boy-servant, was staying at the Cistercian Abbey of Sainte Marie du Pont-Colbert, Versailles. He actually retired to the monastery on , where he was neither permitted to offer Mass nor recognized as a bishop. He lives in a small house adjoining the convent, but with its own entrance on the road. In accordance with established practice, he was treated as if he had never been ordained; so, his only satisfaction, in Appolis' opinion, was dressing like clergy. In doing so, the did not assert that his orders were not valid, it just refused to discuss the matter. He wore a simple cassock \\"without any episcopal insignia.\\" \\"Out of politeness he was addressed as \\", according to Anson, and for the rest of his life he \\"led a quiet and secluded life in a cottage within the monastery grounds, waited on by his boy-servant.\\" Years after Vilatte's death, M. Francis Janssens, abbot-general of the abbey, wrote: Anson wrote that there were rumors that Janssens offered Villate a home \\"at the request of Pope Pius XI\\" and gossip that Vilatte was granted a pension of 22,000 francs annually. According to Appolis the Roman authorities denied that rumor but it did not seem doubtful for Appolis, that the gave Vilatte financial assistance that it often gives to converts. \\"Stories went around Paris that Pius XI had been prepared to allow Vilatte's re-ordination\\" but Vilatte declined the offer because he was \\"convinced that he was a bishop as well as a priest.\\" According to Kirkfleet, an article, in The Salesianum, about Vilatte \\"raises a well-founded doubt about the sincerity of his reconciliation to the Church, and cites an attempt by him to 'ordain' a young man to the priesthood shortly before his death.\\" According to Anson, Emanuel- Anatole-Rapha√´l Chaptal de Chanteloup, Auxiliary Bishop of Paris, wrote to Brandreth that, Vilatte secretly ordained and consecrated a novice at the monastery. \\"The ridiculous affair was kept quiet\\", wrote Anson, but others dismissed it as a rumor. According to Appolis, Vilatte hoped that he would be allowed to say mass at the time of his episcopal jubilee. He died of heart failure on , and was buried in a Versailles' cemetery, without episcopal vestments and with a requiem mass celebrated for a layman. \\"Shortly after the funeral both his American servant and his private papers vanished.\\"  Occultists  Eugen Weber wrote in The Historical Journal that by the nineteenth century, the Church's hold on everyday life had been severely weakened and, \\"[e]mancipated from formal religious observance, new believers sought new systems to replace the old, adopted the language of the old to present the new\\". An extensive underground of secret organisations flourished in the ensuing religious anarchy following the dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution, to such an extent that the 19th century could be characterised as, Joanne Pearson describes, in Wicca and the Christian Heritage, these \\"cults and counter religions\\" as often \\"combining heterodox Christianity, occultism, Freemasonry and spiritualism\\", and considers the Johannite Church (') founded by Bernard-Raymond Fabr√©-Palaprat as an exemplar of sects that were revivals of heresy; they were linked with \\"gnosis such as Catharism and the Templars, and sought to return to the simplicity of an imagined primitive Christianity.\\" Pearson notes the Johannite Church attracted lapsed Catholic bishops and priests. The paradox of 19th century French religious revival, alongside anti-clericalism and irreligion, is characterised by David Blackbourn, in Comparative Studies in Society and History, as \\"a patchwork affair that took place alongside widespread dechristianization\\". According to Massimo Introvigne, in Aleister Crowley and Western Esotericism, Vilatte is \\"grandfather\\" of hundreds of ' and a \\"key figure\\" in the subculture history. He explains that after Bricaud, \\"in contact with all the European occult underground of his time\\", was consecrated by Giraud interest in occultism grew in Gnostic Churches which consecrated Freemasons and occultists as bishops. For example, Bricaud consecrated Theodor Reuss of the ' (OTO). Ren√© Gu√©non called Bricaud, in Theosophy, an occultist and wrote that Bricaud's presence among the ' (ECF) operatives \\"is an example of the relations that exist between a throng of groups that at first glance one might believe to be complete strangers to one another.\\" According to Gu√©non, the \\"seems to have had only an ephemeral existence\\" but was unambiguously linked to Theosophists. Translation of He quoted Annie Besant, from The Theosophist, who described \\"the little known movement called the Old Catholic\\" as a \\"living, Christian, Church.\\" The English edition of Gu√©non notes that, in Russia, the term Living Church \\"was meant to denote a 'modernist' organization set up with aid of the Bolshevik government in order to compete with the Orthodox Church, the intended implication being that the Orthodox Church, by contrast, must be considered a 'dead Church'. Doubtless\\", Gu√©non's editor thought, \\"Besant had precisely the same intention regarding the Roman Catholic Church.\\" Bricaud was consecrated as Tau Johannes, Gnostic Bishop of Lyon, in 1901. He was previously involved with the ' of (also known as Pierre-Michel- Elie) and Fabre-Paliprat's ' Joined the Martinist Order. On , Vilatte ordained Louis-Marie-Fran√ßois Giraud, an ex-Trappist monk but then a ceremonial magician associated with the Universal Gnostic Church. Bricaud was consecrated by Giraud, on , into the Vilatte stream. Vilatte Orders The awards or decorations associated Vilatte include the Order of the Crown of Thorns (OCT) and the Order of the Lion and the Black Cross (OLBC). Both are condemned by the Holy See and Italy lists both as illegal decorations. The International Commission on Orders of Chivalry (ICOC) includes a list of ecclesiastical decorations in its Register since 1998, which only \\"possess full validity as awards of merit or honours within the respective Churches which have instituted them\\" but excludes bodies \\"which are often created as a purely private initiative, and which subsequently place themselves under the 'protection' of a Patriarchal See or Archbishopric.\\" Also Neither the or are found in the Register. Order of the Crown of Thorns Louis-Fran√ßois Girardot and Vilatte originated a pair of groups. The two separately founded orders had the same name but different origins and were combined, although it is not clear what that meant. The San Luigi organization says that the orders were inspired by the ', founded by King Louis IX of France, and also that \\"it is not asserted that there is a continuous and historically verifiable link between the present-day Order and these bodies.\\" Also: There are two separate foundation stories for the ; one in 1883, the other in 1891. These foundation stories were not believed by some during Vilatte's lifetime; Gu√©non wrote that \\"dignitaries of this Church have a mania for titles of nobility as others have for fantastic decorations; thus [... Vilatte] invented the 'Order of the Crown of Thorns'.\\" The organization acknowledges the lack of verifiable facts about the monastery but says that some documents were destroyed in a house fire in 1918 and other documents were seized by the Vatican in 1929 after Vilatte's death. In 1957, Girardot recanted his 1883 foundation story.Author unknown, Title unknown, Interm√©diaire des Chercheurs et Curieux (in French) (Paris) 21. Sep 1971. . Google Books 1883 foundation story The was reputedly founded in 1883. According to the San Luigi organization, after the French protectorate of Tunisia was established in 1881, France sought to colonize the Ottoman Empire's Fezzan province as part of the Scramble for Africa. A small group of monks settled in Ghadames in 1883. The organization says that there is no documentation about their past. It is unclear if the monastery was a satellite of a mother abbey, if it was ever considered stable enough and large enough to be elevated to the rank of an abbey, if they had the canonically required number of twelve monks to elect an abbot, if his election received the approbation of their provincial prior, if after his ecclesiastical confirmation he received abbatial blessing from any bishop in communion with the Holy See, or even if any of their actions were sanctioned at all. Nevertheless, the monks called their monastery the Abbey-Principality of San Luigi and they claimed sovereignty, as a theocracy, over the surrounding secular territory. Disease was endemic; attempts to convert the local Muslim population to Catholicism were rejected; and in less than a year, on , the monastery was sacked and at least one monk was murdered. Five monks, including what the organization calls their third abbot, Jos√© Mendoza, survived and were exiled. Mendoza was somehow elected by less than the canonically required twelve monks. Without mentioning the Sahara and Sahel situated between Ghadames and the Sudd, the organization says that the monks traveled across the Sudd and arrived in the Kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara on . There, the organization says, Omukama Kabarega of Bunyoro granted territory to the monks to settle and establish a monastery. The organization says that Kabarega conferred a title, Mukungu of the Chieftainship of the Ancient Abbey- Principality of San Luigi, upon Mendoza. In 1888, all the monks died from an epidemic, except Mendoza, who then abandoned the monastery in Bunyoro and returned to Europe. The organization says that \\"legalization by a French government official established the recognition of the Abbey-Principality by the French state\\" when Seine-Port Mayor Eug√®ne Clairet was involved in a transfer of titles from Mendoza to Girardot. On ,again with Clairet's involvement, Girardot transferred those Mendoza titles to Vilatte. The organization says that the monastery, of at least seven monks, \\"was constitutionally independent as a theocratic state\\" and a \\"colonising power\\" under which \\"the local population had no political rights whatsoever\\" and \\"were to be subjugated under the absolute rule\\" of the monastery. The organization confers reputed titles of nobility The organization also describes itself as an Old Catholic church. The organization believes itself to be the legitimate de jure government-in-exile of its former territory in the Fezzan. \\"The Abbey-Principality aims ultimately to secure the territorial restoration of the original Abbey-Principality in Libya, but is aware that political and related considerations are likely to preclude this objective for the time being\\". The organization also believes that it is also theoretically empowered to open embassies although it has not done so as yet. 1891 foundation story The was also allegedly founded in 1891 and authorized by Peter IV, Patriarch of Antioch. The asserts that because \\"none of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchal Sees possess any type of direct Sovereignty, [...] the decorations instituted by them may not be deemed as equivalent to those bestowed by the Roman Pontiff not only in his Spiritual Capacity but also in his temporal position as Sovereign of the Vatican City State.\\" \\"Protection is an attribute of Sovereignty, which none of these Sees actually posses\\", according to the . Order of the Lion and the Black Cross Valensi affair The Valensi affair was a scandal in 1910s France, named after Guillaume Valensi. It resulted in arrests and convictions for fraud and trafficking illegal decorations. Documents and blank diplomas of decorations of various orders were seized which included a number of blanks printed in Arabic and others bearing what purported to be, the signatures of living and dead prominent French statesmen. Five men were placed on trial, excluding Valensi, who was judged to be not mentally competent. The investigation was begun after a client became suspicious of the authenticity of the signatures on the diploma of the Tunisian order of Nichan Iftikhar that he purchased and reported the whole affair. Valensi and an accomplice were arrested on charges of fraud and trafficking illegal decorations. According to The New York Times, the ' reported that the trafficking in decorations scandal spread as far as Berlin were many well-known persons were decorated. As it spread, searches were carried out against Valensi and his accomplices which led to several arrests and the revelation that duped officials in Lille had been \\"hoaxed in the most complete and amusing manner\\" by Valensi and two accomplices into thinking that they were Moorish notables. Vilatte was implicated in the Valensi affair by being identified as the Marie Timoth√©e of the Principality of San Luigi, whose signature appeared on diplomas of the trafficked by Valensi. Vilatte responded to a ' article about the diploma by saying that the article discredited him by incorrectly identifying him as the signatory. He denied having any thing to do with the published diploma, Valensi, or with the . He said that his had nothing in common with the diploma from the Principality of San Luigi. Vilatte said that his religious name was Mar Timoth√©us I and not Marie Timoth√©e. In 1913 ' printed an article about the Valensi affair based on Maurice Pujo's ', which connected it to organized crime. Based on Pujo listed another Vilatte-affiliated group, the Grand Prix Humanitarian of France and the Colonies, networked with a Georges Brassard conglomerate which included the make-believe Free State of Counani. Also According to seized documents, Valensi was Chancellor to the Consul-General in Paris for the make-believe state. Pujo included an excerpt from a letter written by Collet, secretary of most Brassard companies, to Adolphe Br√©zet, \\"president of the Free State of Counani\\", which stated that Br√©zet would receive, among several blank diplomas sent to him, a blank \\"officer of San Luigi\\" diploma. Condemnation by the Catholic Church The Holy See had stated twice, first in 1953 and again in 1970, that it does not recognize either of the orders. Guy Stair Sainty wrote that an \\"increasing number of such bodies\\" troubled the Holy See which \\"issued statements condemning such 'Orders'\\" in 1935, 1953, 1970 and 1976. He noted that the \\"most complete recent condemnation\\" was included in Orders of Knighthood, Awards and the Holy See, by Archbishop Igino Eugenio Cardinale. The self-styled orders are described as \\"originating from private initiatives and aiming at replacing the legitimate forms of chivalric awards.\\" The statement points out that, they \\"take their name from\\" extinct Orders or \\"which had been planned but were never realized or, ... which are truly fictitious and have no historical precedent at all.\\" While they \\"style themselves as autonomous\\", these \\"private initiatives\\" qualify their names, according to the statement, with terms to \\"increase the confusion of those who are not aware of the true history of Orders of Knighthood and of their juridical condition.\\" For example, \\"these alleged Orders claim for themselves ... such titles as ... Chivalric, ... Sovereign, Nobiliary, Religious, ...\\" \\"Among these private initiatives, which in no way are approved of or recognized by the Holy See, one can find alleged Orders such as\\" The Crown of Thorns and Lion of the Black Cross. The statement explains that, \\"to avoid equivocations ... because of the abuse of pontifical and ecclesiastical documents, ... and to put an end to the continuation of such abuses, harmful consequences for people in good faith, we ... declare that the Holy See does not recognize the value of the certificates and insignia conferred to the above-named alleged Orders.\\"  Recognition of ordinations  Vilatte was ordained prior to the 1889 establishment of the Old Catholic Churches' Union of Utrecht and its . From its inception, the decided \\"to act as a body whenever the Old Catholic Churches of the Union of Utrecht were confronted with questions pertaining to relationships with other churches\\" and as an outcome formalized its decisions as well as refined its view of episcopacy. Peter-Ben Smit wrote, in Old Catholic and Philippine Independent Ecclesiologies in History, that the denied the claims of those \\"who claimed to be Old Catholic bishops\\" and those \\"who claimed Old Catholic credentials\\" on a number of principles such as: \\"bishops have to be bishops of a church in order to be truly bishops\\" and \\"bishops should act in accordance with the as far as consecration of further bishops and contacts with other churches.\\" As repercussion, according to Smit, bishops who do not live up to their commitment cease to be members of the . Citing various official Old Catholic works, Smit further wrote that, \\"the orders of ' in general, and specifically those of Vilatte, Donkin, Kaminski, Miraglia, and of all those consecrated by them, are not recognized, and all connections with these persons is formally denied.\\" According to Anson, the ' published a statement on , that \\"Vilatte had never been a priest of this body nor any other genuine Old Catholic Church\\". Cerretti's reply to that statement was published in the , '. Cerretti wrote that regardless of the 's denial, the documents show that Vilatte was ordained by Herzog in Bern and was consecrated by \\"three Jacobite Bishops\\" in Colombo. Anson thought Vilatte \\"must have been pleased that he had managed to convince\\" Cerretti \\"of the facts of his priesthood and episcopate, even though they were irregular.\\" Vilatte wanted the to evaluate his orders but the would not. After his 1899 recantation, Vilatte was not assigned any post in the which would imply a definite acknowledgment of his priestly character. Anson wrote that \\"stories went around Paris\\", after his 1925 recantation, that the pope was \\"prepared to allow Vilatte's ordination to the priesthood ', but that he had refused the papal offer, being convinced that he was a bishop as well as a priest.\\" \\"The pope agreed to let Vilatte be ordained a priest, but that offer was refused\\", wrote Marx and Blied. \\"If this proposal was really made, a vexing question about Old Catholic orders is raised. Lack of data precludes any discussion.\\" \\"In practice, the Church ignores orders received by apostates from schismatic bishops\\", wrote William Whalen, in Faiths For the Few. \\"These men, if reconciled to the Church, need not recite the Divine Office or even observe celibacy.\\" \\"No formal pronouncement on the validity of his orders was ever made by the Roman authorities.\\" According to Marx and Blied, Merry del Val's opinion was that Vilatte was a genuine bishop. But Merry del Val \\"maintained that throughout his episcopal career Vilatte had so 'commercialized' ordinations and consecrations, that he himself was not able to regard them [those which Vilatte conferred] as valid.\\"  Works or publications  Most works by Vilatte are not readily accessible.

Born in Clarecastle, County Clare, Daly first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Flannan's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Clare minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1989‚Äì90 National League. Daly subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland medals and three Munster medals. He captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 1995 and 1997.

In addition to this he also won five championship medals. Throughout his career Daly made 30 championship appearances. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 21 February 2002. His uncles, Haulie and John Daly, also played hurling with Clare. Daly is widely regarded as one of Clare's all-time greatest and most popular players. During his playing days he won three All-Star awards, while he was later chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll. In retirement from playing Daly became involved in team management and coaching. After guiding Clarecastle, Kilmoyley and Kilmihil to club titles in their respective counties, he had an unsuccessful three-year spell as manager of the Clare senior team. During a six-year tenure as Dublin manager Daly guided the team to their first provincial and national successes in over fifty years. Biography Anthony Daly was born in Clarecastle, County Clare in 1969. He was educated at the local national school and showed great skill at the game of hurling in his youth. He later attended St. Flannan's College in Ennis, a virtual nursery for young hurling talent. It was here that Daly first tasted hurling success when he won both Dr. Harty Cup and All-Ireland colleges' titles with the college in 1987. Daly later worked as a bank official, before leaving this job to open his own pub. He owned a sports shop in O'Connell Street, Ennis, before it closed in 2012. He also owns Murty Brownes pub in Tullycrine, Co Clare, which he ran from 1999 before leasing out in 2009. He married Eilish Murphy in 1997, they have three daughters. On 28 February 2008 Daly was profiled on the TG4 television programme Laochra Gael. In October 2014, Dalo, his autobiography was released. It was nominated for the 2014 Irish Sports Book of the Year award. Playing career Clarecastle Daly began his hurling career at club level with Clarecastle. After coming to prominence at juvenile and underage levels, he joined the club's senior team in 1987 and claimed his first counth senior championship medal as a substitute that year after a 0-15 to 0-11 defeat of Feakle in the final. Daly subsequently became a member of the starting fifteen and was at left wing-back when Clarecastle suffered a 3-14 to 1-11 defeat by Sixmilebridge in the 1989 final. Daly claimed his second winners' medal, his first on the field of play, when Clarecastle beat Scariff by 0-14 to 1-05 in the 1991 final. By the time Clarecastle reached the 1994 final, Daly had been appointed team captain. He claimed a third winners' medal and had the honour of collecting the cup after the 1-08 to 0-08 victory over St. Joseph's Doora- Barefield. After defeat to Wolfe Tones in the 1996 final, Daly won a fourth championship medal the following year after a 2-11 to 0-11 win over St. Joseph's Doora-Barefield. He later added a Munster Club Championship medal to his collection after Clarecastle defeated Patrickswell in the 1997 Munster final. Having suffered a five-point defeat by Sixmilebridge in the 2002 final, Daly lined out in an eighth and final championship decider in 2003. In what was his last senior game for Clarecastle, he ended his career with a fifth winners' medal following the 3-14 to 1-11 defeat of Ballyea. Inter- county By the late 1980s Daly had come to the attention of the Clare inter- county selectors. He quickly joined the Clare minor team hurling team; however, he narrowly missed out on a Munster medal in 1989 as he was overage by one year. Daly subsequently moved onto the inter-county under-21 team but had little success in this grade either. In late 1989 Daly played with the Clare senior team for the first time in a National Hurling League game against Waterford. It was a successful campaign as he subsequently won a Division 2 winners' medal in his debut season. Daly made his first Munster Championship appearance in 1990 when Clare took on Limerick, however, it wasn't a happy period for Clare, then regarded as the minnows of Munster hurling. Two years later in 1992 Daly was appointed captain of the Clare senior hurling team, a position he held until 2000. In 1993 Clare were trounced in the Munster decider by Tipperary in 1993, having already being relegated from the top flight of the National League. After winning a second Division 2 title in the National League in 1994, Daly's side went on to lose another Munster decider, this time to Limerick. In spite of these setbacks, Daly won a first All-Star award that year. In 1995 Ger Loughnane took over as manager of the Clare senior hurling team and made sweeping changes. New fitness regimes and new personalised diets and, above all, a new psychological approach, resulted in the fittest and most prepared Clare team ever taking to the field for a third consecutive Munster final in 1995. Limerick were the opponents for a second consecutive year and took an early lead. Clare never surrendered and, thanks to an inspirational penalty by goalkeeper Davy FitzGerald, fought back to win by 1‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì11. It was Daly's first Munster title and Clare's first since 1932. Daly's side later qualified for the All-Ireland final and were the underdogs against reigning champions Offaly. Although trailing at half-time, substitute √âamonn Taaffe scored a crucial goal to propel Clare to a 1‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì8 victory. It was their first championship title in eighty-one years. As well as collecting an All-Ireland medal as captain, Daly was later honoured with his second All-Star award. After surrendering their provincial and All- Ireland crowns in 1996, Clare bounced back the following year. A 1‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì18 defeat of Tipperary gave Daly a second Munster medal in three years. Clare subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland decider. Due to the introduction of the \\"back-door\\" system Tipperary provided the opposition in the first all- Munster All-Ireland final. The game itself was one of the best of the decade. Clare were well on top for much of the game, however, Liam Cahill and Eugene O'Neill scored twice for Tipp in the last ten minutes. John Leahy missed a goal chance in the last minute while another Tipp point was controversially ruled wide. At the full-time whistle Clare won by a single point ‚Äì 0‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì13. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Daly as captain. Daly won his third and final Munster medal in 1998 following a tense draw and a replay with Waterford. While Clare were installed as the favourites to retain their All- Ireland crown, a series of bizarre events led to one of the most controversial championship summers ever. Clare drew with Offaly in the All-Ireland semi- final, however, in the replay Clare were winning by two points when the referee, Jimmy Cooney, blew the whistle with two minutes of normal time left to be played. The Offaly fans were outraged and staged a sit-down protest on the Croke Park pitch. The result wasn't allowed to stand and Clare were forced to meet Offaly for a third time that year. They lost the second replay. Daly later won a third All-Star award. A defeat by Cork in the Munster decider in 1999 brought an end to the golden age of Clare hurling. In early 2001 there was much speculation that Daly was going to retire from inter-county hurling. After initially returning to the training panel he opted out again prior to the championship. After contemplating a return to the inter-county scene again in 2002, Daly finally confirmed his retirement in 2002. Inter-provincial Daly also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling championship where he played alongside his championship rivals from other Munster hurling counties. He first played for his province in 1993 as Munster were surprisingly defeated by Ulster in the semi-final. Defeat was Munster's lot again in 1994; however, Daly won his first Railway Cup title following a defeat of Ulster in 1995. Daly was provincial captain in 1996 as he collected a second Railway Cup title after Munster's victory over Leinster. Managerial career Clarecastle In 2002 Daly had just retired from club hurling when he took over as trainer of the Clarecastle senior hurling team. In his debut year he guided the club to the county championship final, however, Sixmilebridge were the winners on that occasion. Clare Daly was appointed manager of the Clare senior hurling team on 22 October 2003. After a relatively unsuccessful National League campaign Daly's side were trounced by Waterford in their first championship outing. After successfully completing the qualifiers system Clare were eventually defeated by reigning champions Kilkenny following an exciting draw and a replay. In 2005 Daly's side exited the provincial championship at an early stage once again. After topping group B of the qualifier series Clare subsequently defeated Wexford to set up an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Cork. In that game Daly's side had the reigning All-Ireland champions on the ropes. Clare led by six points at one stage, however, Cork fought back to defeat Clare by just one point. The defeat was a massive blow for Clare, however, Daly was offered another year as manager thanks to his performance. In 2006 Clare were comprehensively defeated by Cork in their opening game in the championship. After topping group B of the qualifier series for the second consecutive year Clare subsequently defeated Wexford to set up an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kilkenny. Clare, however, were defeated once again. Following this defeat Daly resigned as manager. Kilmihil Between 2001 and 2005 Daly was involved in bringing hurling to West Clare. He managed underage Kilmihil teams from u-14 to minor over a period of 5 years. He enjoyed relative success capturing the 2003 u-16C Clare hurling championship and the 2004 Minor C Clare hurling championship. Kilmoyley Daly returned to club management in 2007 when he took over from John Meyler as manager of the Kilmoyley senior hurling team in Kerry. His first season in charge saw the club reach the championship decider for the first time in three years, however, Lixnaw were the winners by six points. Kilmoyley returned to the championship decider again in 2008, this time with Causeway as the opposition. A comfortable 1‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì8 victory gave Daly his first championship title in Kerry. Daly guided Kilmoyley to a third successive final appearance in 2009. St. Brendan's, Ardfert were the opponents, however, they proved no match for Kilmoyley who recorded a 1‚Äì19 to 2‚Äì8 victory. Three- in-a-row proved beyond Daly's Kilmoyley team, as the side were defeated by Lixnaw in the championship semi-final in 2010. Daly stepped down as manager following the defeat. Dublin Daly was ratified as manager of the Dublin senior hurling team on 24 November 2008. Daly chose Vincent Teehan, Richard Stakelum and Ciar√°n Hetherton as his selectors with the Dublin team for 2009. Daly guided Dublin to the Walsh cup shield on Sunday 1 February following a 1‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì15 defeat of Leinster rivals Offaly in Banagher. Previously Dublin overcame Laois comfortably on a 0‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì8 scoreline to qualify for the final. It was an impressive recovery after the Dubs were trounced 6‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì12 in the Walsh cup first round by all-Ireland champions Kilkenny at Parnell park on 18 January 2009. Alan McCrabbe impressed for Daly's team scoring twenty six points in the early season competition as the Dubs warmed up for the national league. The Clare native was on familiar territory on Sunday 8 February as he led Dublin into their opening national hurling league division one encounter against Cork at P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. The game was played under the backdrop of the impasse in Cork GAA where the 2008 panel have refused to play under current manager Gerald McCarthy. The Dubs overcame a determined Cork, who included fifteen debutants, by 4‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì14. The young Dublin team secured three early first half goals from John Kelly and two from teenager Liam Rushe to lay down the foundations of victory. Alan McCrabbe top scored again for the Dubs with 1‚Äì9 as Daly's team garnered two points from their first game of the league campaign. One week later on 15 February 2009 the Clare native saw a vastly improved performance from his team as Dublin overwhelmed John McIntyre's Galway 2‚Äì21 to 0‚Äì15 at Parnell Park in round two of the national league division one campaign. Dublin topped Division one following their bright start to the league with two wins from two matches. Dublin finished the league campaign in third position, one place before qualification for the NHL finals. The final game was a loss to Kilkenny by 2 points at Nowlan Park. Daly's 2009 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship began with a Leinster Senior Hurling Championship clash against Antrim. It proved to be a relatively comfortable win for Dublin with McCrabbe dominating with 1-09 in a game that finished 2‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì12 at Croke Park. This victory set up a semi-final clash against the 2008 leinster finalists Wexford. The semi-final proved to be a hard fought game at Croke Park. Dublin defeated Wexford by 0‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì13 with Alan McCrabbe once again dominating the scores with 0‚Äì10 which secured Dublins place in the Leinster final for the first time since 1991 which was a loss to Kilkenny. Kilkenny retained the Leinster title with a hard fought victory against Dublin with Martin Comerfords two goals proving the difference between the sides. Dublin were drawn in their first ever All-Ireland hurling quarter final against Limerick which could have taken Dublin to their first All- Ireland semi-final since 1948. The game finished with the Treatymen winning 2‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì17 at Semple Stadium thus ending Dublin and Daly's 2009 campaign. After a good League captain in 2009 2010 didn't go as well Dublin just staying up ahead of Limerick. Dublin started there Leinster Senior Hurling Championship with a Quarter-final win over Laois with set up a semi-final with Kilkenny the side they had been unlucky to lose to the year before in the final. The game turned out to be a very onesideed affair with Kilkenny running out easy winners on a scoreline of 4‚Äì19 to 0‚Äì12. Dublin entered the All- Ireland Qualifiers at Phase 3 but suffered a shock 1‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì19 loss to Antrim ended there championship for the year. 2011 started well for Daly and Dublin they won the Walsh Cup beating Kilkenny in the final. He later led Dublin to a first National Hurling League Div 1 final in sixty-five years. In the final they over came Kilkenny by 0‚Äì22 to 1‚Äì07 to win a first league title since 1939. In July 2013, Daly managed Dublin to win the 2013 Leinster hurling final against Galway by 2‚Äì25 to 2‚Äì13, their first title in 52 years. In September 2014, Daly stepped down as Dublin manager after six years in charge. Kilmacud Crokes On the 21 November 2017, Daly was confirmed as the new senior hurling manager of Kilmacud Crokes, succeeding his former Clare team- mate Ollie Baker who had been in the role since 2013. Antrim On 4 December 2018, Daly was named as an advisor to new Antrim senior hurling team manager Neal Peden in 2019.

It is located on the western corridor along Mysore Road, bordered by Nagarbhavi and Rajarajeshwari Nagar . History The name Kengeri comes from the Kannada words Tengu coconut and Keri meaning place. The place is still surrounded by Coconut farms, most of them ruled by Vilperi the Coconut Baron. The place has been ruled by a number of dynasties including Gangas, followed by Cholas. In 1050 AD, Chola king Rajendra Chola erected a Tamil inscription depicting details of grants made to Eshwara Temple at Kengeri.Article in Deccan herald The provinces of Kengeri and surrounding areas came under the control of Kings of Kukkalanadu, who had Kithnahally near Tavarekere as the capital and ruled Nelamangala, Ramanagaram, Bangalore South (Actually, parts of Kanakapura district which was part of Bangalore earlier and was considered Bangalore South) and Magadi taluks. After Hoysala ruler's regime, during the period of Vijayanagar Empire, Kengeri was vested with Yelahanka province administration. Later, when Maratha warrior Shahaji won Bangalore, Kengeri came under Shahaji's regime. During 1677 AD, King of Mysore Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar won Kengeri and was in the province of Mysore. Tippu Sultan reportedly took shelter in Kengeri Fort while at war with the British. When the English captured Bangalore, the fort was reportedly destroyed to prevent its use. In the survey report prepared by Colonel McKenzie and Bakunin, after death of Tippu, there is mention about remains of Kengeri Fort. The area is now recognised as fort area (Kengeri kote/Kengeri fort). During Tippu's reign, Kengeri was famous centre for sericulture industry. It is learnt that Tippu for the first time bought foreign knowledge of sericulture and encouraged people to cultivate and produce the same. In 1866, Signor de Vecchi, an Italian, noticing the then depressed condition of the silk industry made efforts with the help of the government for its revival. He also made some scientific study of silkworm rearing and causes for their degeneration. To remedy these defects, silkworm eggs were imported for the first time from Japan and were distributed among the people of the trade. This brought about revolutionary changes. Finally, a steam factory for silk- filature was established at Kengeri with eight basins. Mostly female orphans from a private Bangalore convent were engaged in the work. The Kengeri Gurukula Vidya Peetha was founded in 1926 by freedom fighters and Gandhians like Dr C B Rama Rao, Swamy Vishwananda, T Ramachandra and K B Purushottam to motivate youngsters to do their bit for social causes. When Mahatma Gandhi visited the Gurukula twice he guided the youngsters to visit villages and organise people to tackle socio-economic problems in these villages through collective efforts. A memorial building had been built at the premises to commemorate the visits of Mahatma Gandhi. The Vidyapeetha, an NGO, runs an orphanage, a free residential school and a short-stay-home for underprivileged women hoping for early rehabilitation. In recent years, several industries have come up in and around Kengeri.

Its members, basically all children of age seven and older, attended an annual ceremony and wore uniforms. The uniforms consisted of red scarves as well as navy blue hats called Titovka. These hats were sometimes white, and bore a red star on the front. A white shirt was often worn with the Pioneer scarf (marama) and the Titovka, although this varied depending on which part of Yugoslavia the particular pioneer was from. Boys often wore navy blue shorts or pants, and girls wore skirts in the same colour, along with white stockings and black shoes. On special occasions, such as a visit from Josip Broz Tito, Pioniri sometimes wore traditional costumes from their native regions of Yugoslavia. Pioneers at the 1961 1st of May parade in Ljubljana The organization was founded on December 27, 1942. It was a substructure within the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia. It published Male novine. The organization was divided into younger pioneers (7‚Äì11 years) and older pioneers (11‚Äì15 years).Lexikon ‚Äì Bund der Pioniere der SFRJ Unlike other pioneer movements the full military salute was used, honoring the children and youth who fought as part of the Yugoslav Partisans of the Second World War.  Induction and pledge  Typically, the induction ceremony took place in school for children aged 7 in the autumn of their first year in school, as part of the Republic Day celebrations. Following the ceremony, the children would be given a red Pioneer Booklet, similar to a communist party membership booklet. The booklet was signed by the \\"President of the Pioneer Committee\\", a senior pioneer and served as evidence of membership. The youngest generation that undertook it was born in 1982, which occurred during the 1989‚Äì1990 school year. The text of Yugoslav Pioneer pledge (pionirska zakletva) may have varied slightly from one school to another. Reconstructed from imperfect recollections, in Serbo-Croatian (Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations): :Danas, kada postajem pionir, :dajem ƒçasnu pionirsku rijeƒç/reƒç :da ƒáu marljivo uƒçiti i raditi, :po≈°tovati roditelje i starije, :i biti vjeran/veran i iskren drug, :koji dr≈æi datu rijeƒç/reƒç, :da ƒáu voljeti/voleti na≈°u domovinu, :samoupravnu Socijalistiƒçku Federativnu Republiku Jugoslaviju, :da ƒáu razvijati bratstvo i jedinstvo :i ideje za koje se borio drug Tito, :da ƒáu cijeniti/ceniti sve ljude svijeta/sveta koji ≈æele slobodu i mir! In Slovene: :Danes, ko postajam pionir :dajem ƒçastno pionirsko besedo :da se bom pridno uƒçil in delal, :spo≈°toval star≈°e in uƒçitelje, :da bom zvest in iskren tovari≈°, :ki dr≈æi svojo obljubo, :da se bom ravnal po zgledu najbolj≈°ih pionirjev, :da bom spo≈°toval slavna dejanja partizanov, :in napredne ljudi sveta, :ki ≈æele svobodo in mir, :da bom ljubil svojo domovino :samoupravno Socialistiƒçno Federativno Republiko Jugoslavijo, :njene bratske narode in narodnosti :in gradil novo ≈æivljenje, polno sreƒçe in radosti. In English: :Today, as I become a Pioneer, :I give my Pioneer's word of honour - :That I shall study and work diligently, :respect parents and my seniors, :and be a loyal and honest comrade/friend. :That I shall love our homeland, self-managed :socialist federal republic of Yugoslavia. :That I shall spread brotherhood and unity :and the principles for which comrade Tito fought. :And that I shall value all peoples of the world who respect freedom and peace! Across the former-Yugoslav territory (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia), many remember their days as Pioneers, and as a result, it is not uncommon to hear people refer to themselves as \\"Titov(a) pionir(ka)\\", meaning \\"Tito's Pioneer\\".  Function  The social function of becoming a pioneer in communist countries was similar to that of First Communion in Roman Catholic Church. In both cases, a child at the critical age of around seven is initiated as a member of a group within which the individuals share certain values and culture. This early initiation increases the likelihood that, once the child becomes an adult, it will identify with the group. Children were taught to be responsible and respectful, were asked to study hard and were considered the future generations of the nation. The hat is still used today.

History Texarkana College was formed in 1927, as a branch of the Texarkana Independent School District, which voted to proceed with plans for establishment of a community college. Its first building was located at the corner of 16th and Pine Streets, and contained classrooms, laboratories, and a gymnasium, the latter two of which were used by both the college and the high school. In 1941, the citizens of Texarkana voted to create a separate Texarkana College District, complete with approval of a $20 mill property tax to fund the District. However, the local school board and the district's Board of Regents would comprise the same individuals until 1957, when the two boards voted to separate. After a successful bond issue in 1948, the College purchased at its present location, and moved there in October 1951. In 1971, Texarkana College and East Texas State University joined to offer upper-level and graduate courses on the Texarkana College campus, whereby Texarkana College students could obtain Bachelor's and Master's degrees without leaving Texarkana. In 1976, Texarkana College deeded to ETSU to build an administration building. The ETSU-Texarkana campus would later become a separately accredited institution and is today's Texas A&M; University- Texarkana, and would later relocate to a separate facility. The Seal of Texarkana College was designed by former instructor Richmond White. Encircling the star of Texas is the live oak branch symbolizing strength and grandeur and the laurel branch representing honor and peace. The year of 1927 is written above the star of Texas to represent the year that Texarkana College was established. Campus Texarkana College is located in the northeast border of Texarkana, Texas, at the junction of Robison and Tucker streets, which is approximately one mile south of Interstate 30.

They speak the Hup language. Residence and neighbors The Hupd'√§h people live in the region bordered by the rivers Tiqui√© and Papuri, tributaries that join the left hand bank of the river Vaup√©s in the Upper Rio Negro region of the state of Amazonas in Brazil and the Department of Vaup√©s in Colombia. They are known as part of the Naduhup language family, and have been in contact with the frontiers of colonization since the 18th century. There are records of countless epidemics of measles, smallpox, and influenza, which decimated the population. Currently they are distributed in approximately 35 villages (local groups) estimated at a total of 1500 individuals. The Hupda villages are, in general, close to areas of Tukanoan, Tariana, Tuyuka and Piratapuyo population, populations which speak languages of the Tukanoan language family, living near the banks of the streams and rivers that make up the hydrographic basin of the Vaup√©s river. There are other tribes who are part of the Hupd'√§h language family in the (Rio) Negro (black) river region. Each tribe has its own language and practically lives in the jungle, on the small streams. Some Yuhup people, for example, live on the streams on the right hand margin of the Tiqui√© river (Casta√±o, Sama√∫ma, Cunuri and Ira streams), are fewer in number than the Hupda and barely have contact with them. The Kakua people live on the streams on the left hand side of the Papuri River, in Colombia, and maintain sporadic contact with the Hupda who live on the streams flowing into the Papuri River. Still in Colombia, are the Nukak people on the Guaviri and En√≠rida rivers. The D√¢w people, commonly known as the Kama, are the smallest tribe and are currently about 100 in number; they live around S√£o Gabriel da Cachoeira although their traditional home is on the streams flowing into the Curicuriari River. Finally the Nad√´b, in permanent contact with the merchants (regat√µes), live by extracting natural jungle products on the Jurubaxi and Uneuixi rivers that flow into the right hand side of the Rio Negro river. The word Mak√∫ is not Hup. It probably comes from the Arawak (Baniwa) and means \\"he who does not have language\\" or \\"he who does not have our language\\". (ma-aku; ma=personal pronoun, aku=language). J. Hill (1986) uses the name \\"Waku√©nai\\" to designate the five northern dialects of Arawak and translates \\"Waku√©nai\\" as \\"people who speak our language\\" (wa-aku-nai; wa=ours, aku=language, nai=associative suffix). J. Hill differentiates the Kuripaco and Baniwa of I√ßana from the Maakunai {ma-ku-nai ma=personal pronoun aku=language nai=associative suffix =those who have no language} to designate other groups whose language the Hupda don't understand. In this case, for Baniwa, the Tukanos would also be Maakunai. Judging based on this linguistic aspect, it is possible to confirm the hypothesis of Nimuendaj√∫ that the various groups known as the Mak√∫ were in the region, living on the banks of the river, before the arrival of the Arawakan, from the North by way of the Cassiquiari channel, and the Tukanos, from the West. In reality, the term Mak√∫ is used inaccurately in the whole Rio Negro region, not only among the indigenous peoples but also among the caboclos ( those of mixed European and native origin) and it is being incorporated into the dialects of the inhabitants of S√£o Gabriel. The semantic context of the term has always been associated with forest as opposed to the horticultural Indians like the Tukanoan and the Arawakan. By reason of the geographical location of their villages, the Tukanoan have always been described as Indians-of-the-river while the Mak√∫ were described as Indians-of- the-forest. Relationships with other indigenous groups The Hupd'√§h maintain complex and permanent historical relationships with the Tukanoan, Desana, Tuyuka, and Tariano Indians of the Vaup√©s, Tiqui√©, and Papuri rivers. This peculiar inter-ethnic relationship is part of the traditions of the peoples of this region, and its preservation would likely guarantee the cultural equilibrium of the peoples of the region. The relationship has already been described as symbiotic, asymmetric and hierarchical, or as an employer/employee relationship. The Tukanoan justify their behavior through myths that tell of the origins of the tribes of the region. The Hupda, according to Tukanoan versions of the myths, were the last to come into world. Consequently, they are considered inferior, lowest on the hierarchy of intertribal relations in the Vaup√©s river basin and, because of this, must perform work deemed inferior, which only the lowest ranking clans in the hierarchy perform. Language The Hupd'√§h call the Tukanoan \\"sokw‚Äô√§t-d‚Äô√§h,\\" which translates as toucan. They also refer to the Tukanoan as \\"w√≥h\\", \\"w√≥h-d‚Äô√§h\\". These terms are used generically, with no distinction as to which linguistic group the other person belongs to. The words used by the Hupda to distinguish the other social groups with which they interact are \\"t√´gh√µih-d‚Äô√§h\\" for non-Indians and agents of the national society. Literally it means 'the sound of the burning fire wood' and is those who come from outside, the white men, coming from the East and owning many things. It has been suggested that the name is derived from the sound of a firearm. For missionaries they use the term \\"p√°√≠d‚Äô√§h\\", distinguishing them as a separate social category to the t√´gh√µih-d‚Äô√§h. The term \\"mer'ah\\" means \\"from the east\\" or \\"from below\\" contrasting \\"p√∂r'ah,\\" which means \\"from the west\\" or \\"from above\\" always using the river as a reference. These terms are also used in relation to directions of travel. An individual will always explain the location of individual groups in this way, without ever defining a boundary, be it linguistic or territorial, as all Hupda consider themselves brothers and part of the same Hup world. They may even say that others talk differently. It may simply be a case of different accent or a few words of the vocabulary. Culture and nuclear family The Hupd'√§h, as hunters, know the forest intimately and do not work in agriculture, which their neighbors do extensively. They are scattered among more than 20 clans. Each of the clans shares a common ancestry and a set of rituals specific to each clan. Marriages are made between clans, as a marriage inside a clan is considered to be incestuous. The married man can live, most commonly, in his father's local group or in his father-in-law's local group. And as all the clans native to the Alto Rio Negro area practice Dabucuri and celebrate Jurupari, the Hupda maintain their own kapi-vaiy√°. The hearth group, \\"kakah\\", is the smallest unit of production and consumption, and can be made up of a nuclear family; it may also include additional persons (mothers-in-law, orphaned nephews, widowed uncles) making it into an extended family. There is no ideal group size, and numbers vary enormously between one local group and another. A hearth group is significantly autonomous, is generally the social unit, which visits other local groups, and is the most mobile part of the local group. The general rule is that the hearth group be self-sufficient and, to that end, each hearth group generally contains two adults, a man and a woman, almost always married to each other. Two couples are never part of the same hearth group while the minimum number of people in a hearth group is two. Hay√°m - the local group The Hupda live in small villages. The local group is normally known as a \\"hayam\\" although there are in fact three other ways it may be named. These terms are related to the local geography: # \\"-deh,\\" which means \\"stream\\" # \\"-nuh\\" (head), the source of the stream # \\"-buk\\" indicates the group stays in a clearing A local group is completely autonomous and, may join another group or split itself between two others. This may cause its transit around relations to be seriously modified from one year to the next. There is no fixed village or camp. The local group is described by reference to the sources of the streams on which it where they live for a particular period. Some groups may reside in one location for years and still give the impression that they are only there temporarily. The names given to these locations are the names of the small streams where they draw water. These local groups [\\"hay√°m\\"] can contain from 15 to more than 50 people and generally each group comprises members of one or two clans. Some villages with more than this number of inhabitants because of the work of missionaries. Each local group is made up of several hearth groups. These hearth groups are smallest unit of production and consumption, and are usually made up of a nuclear family and, in some cases, those who have joined it. The local groups were based at the sources of the small streams, tributaries to Papuri, Japu and Tiqui√© rivers. The members of a local group wandered within a certain perimeter, always using as reference one of the streams; they did not however migrate beyond this specific territory. When they leave the territories, for a predetermined length of time, it is to hunt or visit the villages of their in-laws. These visits are periodic and are important to the regeneration of the renewable resources of the area where the local groups have established their villages. Frequently a hearth group may, during the year, move from one local group to another and stay for long or short periods of time. In fact, these long visits to other villages are common, and someone is always visiting a group. The mobility of the Hupda is impressive for their knowledge of all the existing trails {t√≠w hup} and where each local group is based. In each local group there is an elderly male member who is considered the leader. He generally knows the history of the ancestors of the clan. These men are not always the chiefs (yo‚Äô√≤m ih), also called captain (capit√£o) in the local Portuguese dialect, and who are, in many cases, chosen to deal with missionaries and other agents. The captains of the local groups are the intermediaries between the non-Indians and the Hupda world. Frequently they need to be able to interpret clearly, for the local group, the ideas and concepts of the missionaries and other agents of the national society who pass through the villages. The job is not easy. Lineage and clans The Hupda social groups are based on unilinear descent, with patrilinear clans, and dispersed in exogamic units. The term clan is being used to describe the basic unit of Hupda society. The Hupda clan does not have a very specific geographical area/location as is found with the Tukanoan clans. The clan is a grouping that gathers members with a common ancestor. Within the concept of Hupda life and the dynamics of social interaction, the clan is of less importance than the local group as it is difficult to identify a local group with a specific clan. It is in the local group that the idea of brotherhood and a concept of territoriality is developed. The concept of territoriality is important to social interactions between the different local groups. The geographic area inhabited by a local group indicates the sense of belonging to a local group but not to a clan. The dabucuri celebrations (\\"p√§‚Äô\\") take place between local groups and not different clans. The clans interact as \\"yaw√°m\\", those with a common ancestor, or \\"k√≥t\\", those directly related to each other. Within the clans sharing a common ancestor a hierarchy exists form the most senior, \\"√≥\\", to the most junior, \\"p√∫y\\". In some larger clans, like for example the \\"Sokw‚Äô√§tnohk‚Äô√∂dt√´h\\" from the middle of the Tiqui√© river, there are several lines of patrilinear descent while all the members consider themselves descended from a common ancestor. These relationships cannot be illustrated in their genealogies by the members of the clans. Each clan knows a specific set of ceremonies and stories and this knowledge is shared among all its members. The most important ceremony a clan has is the one that gives (transmits) its name. It is generally performed by the oldest male in the clan who has a direct familial relationship with the person receiving the name or by the father's father if he is still alive.. The ritual is generally called \\"bi‚Äô√¨d - h√†t\\" or name of ceremony. This is a naming ritual where the name of an ancestor is changed and is given to a newborn child. The name is used in everyday life and there is no secrecy about the \\"bi‚Äô√¨d - h√†t\\". Each clan has a set of five to seven proper names for each sex. These names are repeated and are given in the birth order of the ancestors. This is seen in fact as the newborn child being swapped for an ancestor. When the swap is made, the child becomes a member of the clan. The first-born son will be given his grandfather's name who in turn received it from his grandfather. The subsequent boys can be given the names of any younger brothers the grandfather had, in no particular order. The name, apart from legitimizing an individual as a member of a clan, defines the person's place in the hierarchy. Thus to have the \\"bi‚Äô√¨d - h√†t\\" is to belong to a clan. To have the name shows a right to, and a possibility of access to, all the knowledge specific to the clan as well as a set of privileges, be they social, economic or ritual. The bearer of a clan name must observe and honor all the responsibilities assigned to their clan. There must be, in the region between the Papuri and Tiqui√© rivers, about 20 named clans. The clans are connected by a hierarchy and scattered across the area; there is no direct link between a clan and a territory. The hierarchy between the clans is not rigid, as can be seen among the Tukanoan. The process of splitting a clan takes place in response to reduced (natural) resources in particular areas. The clan has no property but is associated with a specific area. For example, all the members of the \\"Dehpuht√®h\\" clan came from the East, they have even said they came from Bel√©m do Par√°. Marriages allowed within the classes of relatives include bilateral cross cousins. The exogamic unit in the Hupda social structure is the clan, patrilinear and patrilocal for preference. The terminology of the kinship of the Hupda has five distinct generations, two above and two below a generation. All the terms of kinship refer to members of the family, real or fictive. The second generation (-2) does not distinguish between affinal and consanguine relatives. All the terms, except mother and father, refer to the real and fictive relative. The terms of kinship identify individuals according to each generation, gender, affinals and cosanguines. The most important kinship term used by the Hupda is the regulation of marriage. In other words, according to them, the preferred marriage is between fictive relatives, or in other words, bilateral cross cousins of the same generation. The role of the Vaup√©s river The Vaup√©s river, where it is principally the Tukanoan who are present, is where most of the outside resources are found, in exchange for work. These are commercial relationships. For the Hupda, this is where the illnesses and curses (of society) come from. The behavior of a Hupda in this environment is, almost always, one of total submission to any and all order. In this environment, where the two apparently contrary tribes interact, age is irrelevant, the setting is defined and dialogue is short and decorous on all parts. It is rare for Hupda to go to Tukanoan villages without being invited or contracted for a job. The reverse is not true. The Tukanoan go to Hupda villages whenever they feel like it, sometimes simply for a walk or to collect things such as cured meat or fish. The relationships between the Hupda and a specific Tukanoan village are enduring if not permanent. It is an employment relationship and can be seen as a boss/employee relationship. These relationships can be individual or may include the whole hearth group. For this reason, the Hupda do not feel comfortable in the Tukanoan village and will not remain there any longer than they have to; they are also afraid of catching diseases. The Hupda perceive the land on the banks of the rivers as belonging to the Tukanoan and their existence is based around this assumption. The Hupda feel most at home and comfortable in the forests. It is where they feel safest from outside threats and find the resources to allow them to survive for long periods of time, without having to move to the banks of the river. In the clearings, where their houses are found, behavior is governed by a different set of rules. The clearing is the special place for ceremonies and socializing with other Hupda. The Hupda share the Vaup√©s river basin with its other inhabitants, as a common environment, living a lifestyle differentiated from others, in its adaptive form, by ideological factors. These ideological factors are dictated by an interpretation of the world, based on a mythological corpus, that assures them a specific role in social and inter- ethnic relations in a hierarchical system. Thus to characterize them simply as hunters, gatherers, nomads, or semi-nomads to differentiate them from other tribes in the region is only relevant at the first level of analysis, where differences between tribes are established, possibly, based on their individual technical-economic systems. In this model are contained the inter- ethnic relations and the use of the land among the human resources necessary for the organization of the land and forest resources, the impact of human activities upon these resources and, most importantly, the maintenance of a balance between the various peoples sharing the region. Cosmology The concept of illness among the Hupda is based on their perception of their presence on this world as defined by their view of the world and humanity. Their cosmology has as a principal feature several worlds superimposed on each other. The terrestrial world [s‚Äô√°h] is the one we live in our bodies [s√°p] and that is found between two ends of a continuous plane. On the East side [mer‚Äôah] is the \\"wed√≥ ip m√≤y\\" (house of the father of the sun and moon) and at the (other) West [p√∂r‚Äôah] end is the \\"s‚Äô√°h-t√∫t\\" from where all the river waters flow and where the cold is found. The other worlds are stacked vertically beneath the earth and the waters (s‚Äô√†k e o p√®j m√≤y - world of the umari and the spirits) and above them, towards the infinite sky (K‚Äô√®g-teh m√≤y, wero-meh m√≤y w√£-m√≤y / world of K‚Äô√®g-teh - principal hero and creator of earthly beings, of the stars, of the birds and the vultures). These worlds are all inhabited by mythological beings in the forms of animals, fruits and energies. The terrestrial world is stuck, or as they say tied, by cip√≥ [y√∫b- tut], an energy whose main source is the coca plant[pu‚Äôuk]. The body [s√°p] of the Hupda and of all humans is in contrast to all the \\"live\\" beings, which can be classified as \\"spirits\\" and which manifest in non-corporeal forms. The Hupda tell that in their bodies there is a point where an energy called \\"haw√§g\\" is found. They are unanimous in their assertion that it is found in their chests at the same height as their hearts. In fact, the Hupda word for heart is the same, \\"haw√§g\\". As people are born, and when they receive their clan names, they become stronger and thus begins the process of the growth of \\"haw√§g,\\" which is initially small and grows at the same time as the physical body. When cocoa [pu‚Äô√∫k], tobacco [hunt], paric√° [se√¢heak] or kapi are used the \\"haw√§g\\" can be perceived. The shaman [bi‚Äôid-ih] uses these plants to dream and thus diagnose the patient's illness. The shaman is the only one, who in a trance or dream, perceives the patient's \\"haw√§g\\". A Hupda, as well as having a body [s√°p] with a \\"haw√§g\\" (point of vital energy), also has a \\"b‚Äôatub‚Äô,\\" which could be referred to as their shadow or personal ghost. This entity is generally associated with negative and malevolent influences. This term is also confused with \\"devil\\" due to the Catholic influence. The bodies of animal merely have the \\"haw√§g\\", they don't have \\"b‚Äôatub‚Äô \\". Some say that dogs may have \\"b‚Äôatub‚Äô \\" as they can see others in the dark. If life and consciousness arise as a result of the development of the \\"haw√§g\\", death occurs when a person loses their (own) \\"haw√§g\\". After death the body (s√°p) is buried and the \\"haw√§g\\" goes to the spirit world, which is close to the world of \\"K‚Äô√®g-te√¢h\\" and other heroes, up in the sky. The ghost (b‚Äôat√∂b‚Äô) remains on earth for a while, afterwards going to a world found beneath the waters form which it can, every so often, reappear on the earth. The material parts of the \\"b‚Äôat√∂b‚Äô\\" are in all the body's secretions such as urine, sweat, catarrh, blood and faeces. It is by way of the orifices from which these secretions emanate that illnesses may enter (the body). Illness and health are therefore the result of the balance between the two forces in the body, the \\"haw√§g\\" and the \\"b‚Äôatub‚Äô\\". Each initiate knows the ceremonies for the protection and strengthening of the \\"haw√§g\\". All the curing ceremonies [bi‚Äôin d√≥hoit√©] invoke the forces of the forest to strengthen the \\"haw√§g\\" and reduce the influence of the ghosts upon the \\"haw√§g\\". If a Hupda is ill or feels unwell, it is common to see them pointing initially at their heart, even if the illness is found somewhere else in their body. The illness shows then, in final analysis, a weakness of the \\"haw√§g\\" and a dominion of the \\"b‚Äôatub‚Äô\\" over the physical body. Medical system The medical system of the Hupda is a shamanic system, both in the way it refers to health and illness and in the way illness is treated. It is mediated by people, usually men, initiates and possessors of 'keys' that allow them access to various worlds in search of understanding for the events occurring on earth (s‚Äôah). Each clan has specific knowledge on a way of treating illness. According to the Hupda, everything that happens on this world (or plane) has already happened in some form in the other worlds in the past (myths). As a result, everything has a meaning and these meanings can be found in the stories of \\"K‚Äô√®g-teh\\". Illnesses can be classified as follows: * Those that lead to death, the most serious and deadly ones - these are caused by enchantments, whose origins are hard to find, caused by other people * Those caused by prepared poisons that have been mixed into the food and drink these can be cured as long as the source (where it came from and who sent it) is known * Illnesses arising from the forest, river or caused by the spiritsfor this type of illness cures can be found which are given by means of ceremony (bi‚Äôid) The term \\"bi‚Äôid\\" covers a set of rituals that range from the most basic blessing to the most complex magic. All the healing practices are done by means of the word. The term \\"Bi‚Äôin\\" (\\"sopro\\") is translated as 'breath' or 'blow' alluding to the way in which the shaman recites the formulas, in a susurration of words with a \\"cuia\\" (gourd made from the fruit of Lagenaria vulgaris) near his mouth. In the local Portuguese dialect the term \\"sopro\\" is associated with this practice. Generally the point is to reinforce the \\"haw√§g,\\" which is sited where the heart is, and to diminish the power of the \\"b‚Äôatub‚Äô\\" over the \\"s√°p\\". This work can take hours. The patient must observe a special diet to get the desired effect. The diets generally involve abstaining from cooked meats, salt and peppers. Another common abstention, almost always required, is that of not touching menstruating women and of sexual abstinence for a prescribed period. The patient must generally remain lying down for the majority of this period.[Renato Athias] References *Athias, Renato 1995.

Literacy rate of Khagaul city is 86.82 % higher than state average of 61.80 %. In Khagaul, Male literacy is around 91.81 % while female literacy rate is 81.23 %. History Khagaul is a historical place. In ancient times, before Christ, Khagaul was called Kusumpura or Kusumpur, near Pataliputra, which was the capital city of the mighty Magadh Empire. Pushpapur was located between Pataliputra and Kusumpur. In modern times Pataliputra is called Patna, whereas Kusumpura or Kusumpur is called Khagaul and Pushpapur is called Phulwari or Phulwari Shree or Phulwari Sharif. Shaktar and Chanakya (also known as Kautilya or Vishnugupta), two famous Prime Ministers of the Magadh Empire belonged to Kusumpur or present day Khagaul during Fourth Century BC. Chanakya had provided initial education and training to Chandagupta Maurya (Great Emperor of Magadh Empire and Founder of the Maurya Dynasty) at this very place. Under the guidance of Chanakya, the mighty Magadh Empire was spread from present day India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan up to Iran after defeating the forces of Alexander and Seleucus. The tyrannical rule of the King Dhanananda over Magadh was brought to an end by the rebellion of Chanakya after arrest, humiliation and death sentence inflicted against his father Chanak by the tyrannical King Dhanananda. Thereafter, Chandragupta Maurya, disciple of Chanakya, was made King Emperor of the Magadh Empire and Chanakya became its Prime Minister. Chanakya was a great scholar, economist, administrator, jurist, lawmaker and a very sharp minded nationalist and shrewd politician. He was a student of the Takshashila or Taxila University, and also worked as an Acharya or professor in the same university. Under the guidance of Chanakya, the mighty Magadh Empire had become the most powerful, most influential, most developed and the richest empire of the world, and Pataliputra had become the most beautiful city. After 5th century AD, Kusumpur was renamed as Khagaul after Khagol or Khagol Shastra i.e. Astronomy, as it was an eminent centre of Astronomical Observatory (Khagoliya Vedhashala) established by Aryabhata or Aryabhatta for Astronomical Studies and Astronomical Research. Aryabhatta is called Father of Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry, Concept of Zero (0) and decimal system. Aryabhata, also called Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder (born in the year 476 AD, at Kusumapura, near Pataliputra or present day Patna in India) was astronomer and the earliest Indian mathematician whose work and history are available to modern scholars. He is also known as Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder to distinguish him from a 10th-century Indian mathematician of the same name. He flourished in Kusumapura‚Äînear Pataliputra (Patna), then the capital of the Gupta dynasty‚Äîwhere he composed at least two works, Aryabhatiya (c. 499) and the now lost Aryabhatasiddhanta. Aryabhatasiddhanta circulated mainly in the northwest of India and, through the SƒÅsƒÅnian dynasty (224‚Äì651) of Iran, had a profound influence on the development of Islamic astronomy. Its contents are preserved to some extent in the works of Varahamihira (flourished c. 550), Bhaskara I (flourished c. 629), Brahmagupta (598 ‚Äì c. 665), and others. It is one of the earliest astronomical works to assign the start of each day to midnight. Aryabhatiya was particularly popular in South India, where numerous mathematicians over the ensuing millennium wrote commentaries. The work was written in verse couplets and deals with mathematics and astronomy. Following an introduction that contains astronomical tables and Aryabhata's system of phonemic number notation in which numbers are represented by a consonant-vowel monosyllable, the work is divided into three sections: Ganita (\\"Mathematics\\"), Kala-kriya (\\"Time Calculations\\"), and Gola (\\"Sphere\\"). In Ganita Aryabhata names the first 10 decimal places and gives algorithms for obtaining square and cubic roots, using the decimal number system. Then he treats geometric measurements‚Äîemploying 62,832/20,000 (= 3.1416) for œÄ‚Äîand develops properties of similar right-angled triangles and of two intersecting circles. Using the Pythagorean theorem, he obtained one of the two methods for constructing his table of sines. He also realized that second-order sine difference is proportional to sine. Mathematical series, quadratic equations, compound interest (involving a quadratic equation), proportions (ratios), and the solution of various linear equations are among the arithmetic and algebraic topics included. Aryabhata's general solution for linear indeterminate equations, which Bhaskara I called kuttakara (\\"pulverizer\\"), consisted of breaking the problem down into new problems with successively smaller coefficients‚Äîessentially the Euclidean algorithm and related to the method of continued fractions. With Kala-kriya Aryabhata turned to astronomy‚Äîin particular, treating planetary motion along the ecliptic. The topics include definitions of various units of time, eccentric and epicyclic models of planetary motion (see Hipparchus for earlier Greek models), planetary longitude corrections for different terrestrial locations, and a theory of \\"lords of the hours and days\\" (an astrological concept used for determining propitious times for action). Aryabhatiya ends with spherical astronomy in Gola, where he applied plane trigonometry to spherical geometry by projecting points and lines on the surface of a sphere onto appropriate planes. Topics include prediction of solar and lunar eclipses and an explicit statement that the apparent westward motion of the stars is due to the spherical Earth's rotation about its axis. Aryabhata also correctly ascribed the luminosity of the Moon and planets to reflected sunlight. The Indian Government named its first satellite Aryabhata (launched 1975) in his honour.

Each were initially assembled at the MONAB Headquarters at HMS Flycatcher (first at Ludham then Middle Wallop in the UK). When the naval threat in the Atlantic was clearly vanishing, with the decline of Nazi Germany, proposals were made to involve the Royal Navy in the Pacific War. The United States Navy's Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Ernest King, did not welcome this, however. A well-known anglophobe, King preferred to exclude the British and, in addition, he laid down operating requirements that could not be met at the time. One of these was that the Royal Navy should be self-sustaining and independent of United States Navy (USN) logistical resources for extended periods of active service.

The route also passes through the cities of Richmond Hill, Darien and Woodbine. I-95 in Georgia has the unsigned designation of State Route 405 (SR 405). Route description All of I-95 in Georgia has three lanes in each direction, except in the Brunswick area and in the area of the I-16 Intersection, where it has four lanes in each direction. From the Florida state line to west of Savannah, I-95 travels along the U.S. Route 17 (US 17) corridor, passing near or through marshlands, and is close to the Atlantic coastline. Annual traffic fatalities variable sign over I-95 north The highway enters Georgia via twin bridges over the St. Marys River, where it immediately enters the city of Kingsland, intersecting State Route 40 (SR 40). The Interstate continues generally north- northeast, bypassing the smaller communities of Woodbine and Waverly en route to Brunswick, where it intersects US 17, US 25, and US 341\\\\. The freeway leaves Brunswick, bypassing the cities of Darien and Midway, before reaching the southern suburbs of Savannah. The route first encounters US 17 again, this time in Richmond Hill, before intersecting SR 204, a busy freeway and southern bypass into Savannah. The route then intersects with I-16 and US 80 in Pooler, also providing direct access to Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport via the Airways Avenue exit (exit 104). After that, the final exit in Georgia is in Port Wentworth, where it intersects SR 21, the major thoroughfare between Augusta and Savannah. I-95 leaves Georgia via twin bridges over the Savannah River, and heads north into South Carolina. The State Welcome Centers on both ends of I-95 are integrated with other interchanges. The northbound Welcome Center is built into the northbound off-ramp with exit 1, while the on-ramp from here runs under a bridge beneath the same off-ramp before leading back onto northbound I-95. The southbound Welcome Center can be found just after the off-ramp for first southbound truck weighing center, only for both facilities to share an on ramp back to southbound I-95. Other rest areas, weigh stations, and visitors centers operate independently with no access to any other facilities or destinations. Northbound I-95 at the interchange with I-16; Note the crossing gates at the on and off ramps I-95 intersects I-16 near Savannah (exit 99). Ramps to and from the eastbound lanes of I-16 feature barrier gates to prevent traffic from entering I-16 in the wrong direction during contraflow lane reversal for hurricane evacuations. The entire length of I-95 in Georgia is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. History 1960s In 1965, I-95 was proposed from the Florida state line to SR 251 near Darien. It was under construction from there to SR 99 near Crescent. It was proposed from there to the South Carolina state line. In 1966, it was under construction from its southern interchange with SR 99 to just north of SR 131 in South Newport. In 1967, it was under construction just north of South Newport. It was under construction from Richmond Hill to I-16 near Savannah. In 1968, it was under construction from the Florida state line to SR 40 in Kingsland. It was also under construction from its southern interchange with SR 99 to SR 251 near Darien. It was open as I-95 from SR 251 to its northern interchange with SR 99 in Eulonia. It was under construction from Eulonia to US 17/SR 25 north of South Newport. 1970s In 1970, the highway was under construction from the Florida state line to just southeast of Woodbine. It was also under construction from US 25/US 341/SR 27 near Brunswick to SR 251 near Darien. It also had an under construction from Eulonia to I-16. In 1971, it was under construction from the Florida state line to northeast of White Oak, and also between the US 17/SR 25 interchanges north of South Newport and in Richmond Hill. In 1972, it was open from the Florida state line to SR 40 in Kingsland. It was under construction from Kingsland to northeast of White Oak. It was under construction from east of Waverly to US 25/US 341/SR 27 near Brunswick. It was open from there to US 17/SR 25 north of South Newport. It was open from Richmond Hill to I-16.

After completion In 1998, the Georgia State Senate passed a resolution to designate the portion of I-95 between the Ogeechee River (Bryan‚ÄìChatham county line) north to the Savannah River in the Greater Savannah Area as the Tom Coleman Highway, in honor of Tom Coleman, a Democrat who served as state senator from 1981 to 1995. Until 2000, the state of Georgia used the sequential interchange numbering system on all of its Interstate Highways. The first exit on each highway would begin with the number \\"1\\" and increase numerically with each exit. In 2000, the Georgia Department of Transportation switched to a mileage-based exit system, in which the exit number corresponded to the nearest milepost. Construction to widen I-95 from two to three lanes started with the Chatham County segment in 1989, with the other county segments done in phases, with the project completed throughout Georgia on December 10, 2010.

It is located in the city of Chi≈üinƒÉu, Moldova. History From the 6th to the 13th centuries, the territory of Moldova was populated by Slavic tribes, the Ulichs and the Tivertsi, along with the Dacians. Not far from the city of Peresechen, in a valley with three lakes, there was a sanctuary dedicated to Slavonic tribal gods and dead ancestors. It was called Ross Valley in honor of the mythical ancestor of the Russian people, Rus. There stood the idols and altars of a number of Slavonic gods and ancestral patrons. In the days of pagan holidays, folk festivals were arranged in the valley and on the lakes. Rose Valley The role of Ross Valley in the religious life of Slavic people declined as the Pechenegs and Cumans invaded these lands in the 9th century. After the dissemination of Christianity among the Slav tribes in the 10th-11th centuries, the sanctuary evidently was destroyed. But its name was preserved among local inhabitants, and in the course of time it was transformed into Rose Valley. Modern times In the 1950s, rose plantations were planted in the Rose Valley. At the end of the 1960s, the park saw some improvement. New lanes were laid, concrete dams were built, and lakes were cleared of silt. Now the central section of the park is decorated with several lakes covering nine hectares. About 50 varieties of trees and bushes grow there.

After studying at the City of London School, the Royal College of Chemistry and the Royal School of Mines he matriculated to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded First Class Honours in geology. After some time spent as a University Extension lecturer he became Lecturer in Geology and Zoology at University College, Bristol in 1879, where he stayed until he was offered the post of Professor of Geology at Trinity College, Dublin. In 1897 he was offered the post of Professor of Geology at the University of Oxford, which he accepted. Considered \\"one of the last true geological polymaths\\", Sollas worked in a number of areas including the study of sponges, brachiopods and petrological research, and during his lifetime published 180 papers and wrote three books. His biggest contribution at Oxford was in expanding the University geology department, hiring new Demonstrators and Lecturers and expanding the facilities available to students. Described as \\"eccentric\\" in his final years, he left much of the running of the Department to J.A. Douglas while he concentrated on research, finally dying in office on 20 October 1936. Early life and education Sollas was born in Birmingham on 30 May 1849 to William Henry Sollas, a ship owner, and his wife Emma Wheatley. He was educated at the City of London School, where he first became interested in chemistry, and from there moved on to the Royal College of Chemistry in 1865, spending two years working with Sir Edward Frankland, and in 1867 gained a scholarship to study at the Royal School of Mines. There he came under the influence of scientists such as Warington Wilkinson Smyth and Thomas Henry Huxley, later saying \\"I owe [Huxley] more, both morally and intellectually, than to any other I can name\\".Watts (1938) p.265 After becoming an Associate of the Royal School of Mines he competed with William Garnett for chemistry scholarships at St. John's College, Cambridge; they were both accepted. At Cambridge Sollas was taught by Thomas George Bonney, who persuaded him to switch to geology, which he did, gaining First Class Honours in the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1873. Academia After graduating Sollas spent six years as a University Extension Lecturer, publishing a syllabus of lectures in 1876 on geology and biology, and in 1879 became Lecturer in Geology and Zoology at University College, Bristol. In 1880 he was made Professor of Geology. In 1883 Sollas left Bristol to take up a position as Professor of Geology at Trinity College, Dublin, where he remained until he was made Professor of Geology at the University of Oxford in 1897. At Oxford his main contribution was significantly expanding the Geology department, appointing new demonstrators and lecturers and employing his own daughters as unpaid research assistants. At the same time he did research in a variety of fields, and was described as \\"one of the last true geological polymaths\\". Professor Sollas lead the 1896 Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society, which was an expedition to Funafuti in the Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu) conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs and the question as to whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on the structure and distribution of coral reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1911. The expedition conducted drilling on the atoll to take borings which it was hoped would settle the question of the formation of coral atolls. There were defects in the boring machinery and the bore penetrated only slightly more than 100 feet (approx. 31 m). In addition to reports of results of the expedition, Prof. Sollas also published The Legendary History of Funafuti. In his later years Sollas became increasingly eccentric, and left much of the running of the Department to his Demonstrator, J.A. Douglas while he concentrated on research. He died in Oxford on 20 October 1936, still in office. After his death Douglas attempted to link him to the Piltdown Man hoax. Research work Sollas's research was over a wide area; during his lifetime he published over 180 papers and three books, and as well as his geological and zoological studies became an expert in anthropology. His first area of interest was the Cambridge Greensand, which he began working on when studying at the University of Cambridge.Watts (1938) p.266 He published nine papers on the formation, mainly on the sponges, and for his work was awarded the Wollaston Medal in 1878. From 1878 until 1889 he dedicated his research work entirely to sponges and fossils, publishing a series of papers and reports on new species. In 1887 he wrote an article on phylum for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. His work on sponges led him to investigate their physical structure, and from there the makeup of chalk. At Bristol he worked in palaeontology, describing a new species of plesiosaurus, but also published papers on the geological makeup of Bristol and the Silesian fossils near the Welsh border.Watts (1938) p.267 After moving to Dublin he worked on foraminifera and brachiopods, before switching to petrological work. His first major paper was on the granite of Leinster, where he conducted a detailed chemical analysis of the rock and invented the diffusion column to assist in this.Watts (1938) p.268 In 1896 he travelled to the Pacific Ocean to investigate the formation of the Funafuti coral atoll, drawing inconclusive results. In 1905 he published the collection of essays The Age of the Earth, and in 1911 an anthropological work Ancient Hunters and their Modern Representatives. In 1889 Sollas became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was awarded the Royal Medal in 1914. From 1900 to 1902 he was vice president, and from 1908 to 1910 he served as president of the Geological Society of London, who awarded him the Bigsby Medal in 1893 and the Wollaston Medal in 1907. Personal life and family  Sollas's first wife (1874) was Helen Coryn, daughter of William John Coryn of Weston-super-Mare. He and Helen had two daughters, both of whom became academics. Elder daughter Hertha received a PhD from the University of Heidelberg and translated several works into German, and younger daughter Igerna became a geologist and zoologist who collaborated on fossils with her father. Helen died in 1911 and in 1914 he married Amabel Nevill Jeffreys, who died in 1928. He did not remarry.

Playing career Clark made his first class debut in 1974‚Äì75 and replaced Mick Malone for a game in 1975‚Äì76. However he was not a regular member of the West Australian team until 1976‚Äì77 when he took 25 wickets at 26.96. In his first eight first class games he took 30 wickets at an average of 28. He was part of the WA attack who defeated Queensland in a Gillette Cup semi-final, defending 77. International Career: 1977‚Äì78 vs India Clark's efforts saw him receive an offer from Kerry Packer to be a part of World Series Cricket (WSC). He eventually turned it down. Clark's business adviser, Mr Bert Hewitt, said a \\"sense of sporting patriotism and loyalty\\" was the overriding factor for this. Clark took eight wickets in the first two games of the 1977‚Äì78 summer at 32.63 and was rewarded by selection in the Australian side against India for the first Test. The bowling attack consisted of Clark, Jeff Thomson, Alan Hurst and Tony Mann. Clark had an excellent game, taking 4‚Äì46 in the first innings (including the wickets of Sunil Gavaskar and Mohinder Amarnath) and 4‚Äì101 in the second (including Gavaskar again and Dilip Vengsarkar). His second innings knock of 12, including a 31 run partnership with Jeff Thomson, proved unexpectedly crucial as Australia won by 16 runs.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63195.html There were press reports about the legitimacy of Clark's action. \\"I don't know that all the fuss is about\\", said Indian captain Bishen Bedi. \\"None of our officials or players have said they consider Clark throws the ball ‚Äî it's something that has been blown up by the Press\\". Clark had a strong second Test, taking 2‚Äì95 and 2‚Äì83 (Gavaskar in both innings) with useful scores with the bat of 15 and 5 not out ‚Äì the latter was important as he and Thomson chased down the 12 runs to win with two wickets in hand. He kept his place for the next two tests. In the third Test Clark took 4‚Äì73 and 4‚Äì96, but Australia's batting was not as strong an India won by 222 runs (Clark's second innings score of 33 was Australia's second highest).http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63197.html He took 2‚Äì66 in the fourth Test, but India won by an innings and 2 runs.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63198.html He suffered a bad back injury that saw him miss a Shield game. He recovered to play a Gillette Game against NSW, taking 4‚Äì20 off 7.2 overs and winning the man of the match award.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37790.html Australia fought back to win the 5th test. It was a difficult game for Australia's bowlers as Thomson broke down early in India's first innings. Clark took 4‚Äì62 and 2‚Äì79.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63199.html Clark took 28 wickets for the series, which was still the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 5 wickets in an innings until overtaken by Pat Cummins in the 2019 Ashes series in England. Wisden later reported that Clark \\"bowled an excellent line and length, even though called upon to do a lot of work. He invariably broke through with the new ball and had a splendid record of dismissing Gavaskar, the principal danger to the Australians.\\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152158.html His work earned him selection on the 1978 tour of the West Indies. 1977‚Äì78 West Indies Tour Clark played in four tests against the West Indies. In the first test he took 0‚Äì41.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63206.html The second 2‚Äì77 with reports saying he \\"bowled gallantly without luck.\\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63207.html The third he got 4‚Äì65 and 4‚Äì124, helping set up Australia's sole test victory.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63208.html In a game against Windward Islands, Clark took a career best 12‚Äì70. The fourth test he got 3‚Äì65 and 2‚Äì62 but Australia collapsed in the second innings and lost the game.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63209.html Clark was dogged by back trouble. He was rested for the game against Jamaica. Clark was the centre of controversy during the tour when local umpire Douglas Sang Hue publicly expressed his doubts about the legality of Clark and teammate Bruce Yardley's bowling, although neither had ever been called for throwing before.Robinson, p. 195. This statement and the no balling of Yardley for throwing in a tour match led to Sang Hue's appointment to umpire the 5th and final Test of the series to be withdrawn, which in turn led to anger from the West Indian public who believed Sang Hue was replaced at the Australian team's request.Robinson, pp. 195‚Äì96. He had taken 31 first class wickets at 23.35 for the tour and 15 wickets at 30.73 for the tests. 1978‚Äì79 Summer England toured Australia for the 1978‚Äì79 summer. At the beginning of the season English captain Mike Brearley said he expected Clark to be one of the players to give his team the most trouble. However Clark began the domestic season slowly and was replaced by Alan Hurst, Rodney Hogg and Geoff Dymock. His form improved later in the summer taking 6‚Äì47 against South Australia, 5‚Äì54 against Victoria and 6‚Äì39 against Queensland. He managed to get back in the team for the first test against Pakistan when Trevor Laughlin was injured. Clark took 1‚Äì56 and 0‚Äì47 in an Australian defeat.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63235.html He was dropped for the second test in favour of Laughlin. He took 35 first class wickets at 30.25 over the summer. He was overlooked for the 1979 World Cup and tour of India. Later career Clark was not selected for the WA team at the start of the 1979‚Äì80 summer. However he forced his way back into the team and was part of Western Australia's Sheffield Shield winning sides in 1980‚Äì81 and 1983‚Äì84; he captained the side in some games. His best season was in 1982‚Äì83 when he took 31 wickets at 25.83. Coaching career Clark was the coach of the Western Warriors. In January 2007, it was announced that Clark would step down from his role as Western Australian coach, a role he has had for ten seasons over two stints. He has guided Western Australia to two Pura Cups and 3 One Day Domestic championships in his tenure as coach. He was also the coach of Yorkshire from 2001‚Äì2002 where he led them to their first County Championship title for 33 years in 2001. The following season were relegated from division one but still managed to win the C & G Trophy, a first Lord's final win since 1987. Yorkshire decided to restructure the coaching staff and Clark was offered the position of Bowling Coach for the 2003 season but declined and left the club at the end of 2002. In 2010, Clark joined Perth radio station 91.3 SportFM's 'Sports Breakfast' team alongside Corbin Middlemas, as well as continuing his expert commentary for their Sheffield Shield broadcasts.

Report Zimbabwean Activist Yemi Katarere The three-day conference, hosted by the Cape Town Ecology Group (CTEG) and the Western Cape branch of the World Conference on Religion and Peace (WCRP) and the Call of Islam aimed to \\"ecologise politics and politicise ecology\\". According to conference organiser, Phakamile Tshazibane, the conference represented a \\"breakthrough\\", since this was the \\"first time groups such as the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the National Council of Trade Unions (Nactu), the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the African National Congress (ANC) found common ground around the issue of the environment.\\" There were also a wide range of religious groupings represented, from Hinduism to Judaism, as well as many people from rural areas such as Kuruman and Tuang. Although the conference opening was marred by the last-minute withdrawal of key international speaker Vandana Shiva due to ill-health, other international environmentalists filled the gap. Bert von Pixteren of Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands told the conference that international environmental groupings had been wary of engaging with South African environmental organisations. However, political changes in the country had made participation possible. He cautioned against the attitude that environmentalists could continue their work without assisting the democratic process in the country. Thobeka Thamage of the South African Women's Environmental Collective in London focused on environmental abuses affecting women around the world, and on the fact that many contraceptive methods endangered women's health. She also drew particular attention to environmental problems facing rural women in Africa, and to the fact that development programmes in the Southern African region had ignored the extra burden carried by women as a result of the migrant labour system employed by South African industry. The need for \\"greater grassroots participation in the development decisions affecting people\\" was the message conveyed by Yemi Katare of the Zimbabwe Environmental Research Organisation (ZERO), who spoke about development problems in general and the lessons to be learnt from the Zimbabwean experience. Debate at the conference centred on issues such as the land question, with many delegates feeling that a new constitution would alleviate the inequalities that had resulted in land degradation in the homelands. Solly Skosana of the PAC reiterated the view that land apartheid had not disappeared and that a constituent assembly was the only mechanism in which environmental concerns over land distribution would be able to be addressed. There was consensus among delegates that unequal land distribution was a major cause of environmental problems in South Africa and that the land itself needed protection under the law. Speaking on behalf of the ANC, Cheryl Carolus criticised the lack of political involvement by environmentalists in the past and made the point that her decision to get involved in politics had arisen out of a desire to empower herself and to regain control over her environment. The issue of workers' involvement in environmental issues was taken up by Nosey Peterse of the Food and Allied Workers Union (FAWU) who told delegates: \\"You can talk about environmental degradation but while you talk workers are losing their jobs because of environmental degradation.\\" \\"You cannot have a fishing industry without fish or agriculture without soil,\\" said Peterse, who then added that a sustainable environment would mean thousands of jobs in the future. He urged delegates not to intellectualise about workers but rather to do something practical about the problem. A statement adopted at the end of the conference declared: \\"A peaceful and just society can only be sustained if its ecological base is sound, and this means working with the people of the country striving for a democratic government and justice in access to land and the common wealth.\\" \\"Ecologically sound practices and projects can only succeed through grassroots participation where the people concerned retain control of those things that affect their lives.\\" Delegates agreed that full grassroots participation would have to involve a change in perception and values towards seeing \\"the interdependence of all living things\\". Inspiration for such values existed in \\"many religious and spiritual traditions, in particular African belief systems.\\" CTEG spokesperson Henri Laurie said the conference was significant in that people from backgrounds that were potentially divisive had shown a willingness to work together. \\"The amount of goodwill was remarkable and the delegates showed an enormous degree of solidarity on the environmental issue.\\" See also *World Summit on Sustainable Development References Environment of South Africa 1991 in South Africa 1991 conferences 1991 in the environment ","title":"South African National Conference on Environment and Development"},{"id":"5797199","text":"Khaniyadhana is a tehsil and a Nagar Palika in Shivpuri district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.

He had a large influence on the styles of karate that would become Shorin-Ryu and its related styles. Early life Chotoku Kyan was born the third son of Chofu Kyan, who was a steward to the Ryukyuan King before the country's official annexation by Japan as Okinawan Prefecture, and originally belonged to Kyan clan of senior court officials having home territory in Shuri Gibu village being also a genuine member of the Shuri warrior class, a concept of which was imported from Japan. His father (born in 1839) was the eldest son of Motonaga Ch≈çy≈ç and a member of the 8th generation of the Motobu Udun, a clan belonging to royalty, and had been adopted into the Kyan family at the age of 17 in order to become the head of household of Ch≈çtoku's grandmother Manabe, the third daughter of Kyan Uƒìkata Ch≈çiku. He himself studied karate under Matsumura S≈çkon. Ch≈çtoku on the other hand was adopted back into the Motonaga family in order to continue the succession of his father‚Äôs family.On the distinction between Shuri-te and Tomari-te Ryukyu-Bugei Blog by Andreas Quast, April 21, 2015 Kyan was noted for being small in stature, suffering from asthma and frequently bed-ridden. He also had poor eyesight, which may have led to his early nickname Chan Migwa (squinty-eyed Chan). Karate legacy Kyan's father is noted as possibly having a background in karate and even teaching Kyan tegumi in his early years. From the age of 16 Ch≈çtoku studied under Matsumura S≈çkon for two years. Afterwards, together with his father Ch≈çfu he moved to Tokyo where he stayed for a total of 9 years as part of the inner circle of Marquis Sh≈ç Tai, the former and last king of the Ry≈´ky≈´ kingdom. According to other sources Chotoku Kyan: A Chronological Look by Dan Smith of American Black Belt Academy with his father he moved to Japan at the age of 12, where he stayed until he was 16. After returning home, probably at the age of 20 he began studying Tomari-te with Kosaku Matsumora and Kokan Oyadomari from Tomari village. Due to disagreement between sources as to the chronology of his relocations it's not possible to reliably establish the age corresponding to his training under these masters. While at 30 years of age, he was considered a master of the karate styles known as Shuri-te and Tomari-te. The two students to have trained with Kyan the longest were Tatsuo Shimabuku and Zenry≈ç Shimabukuro, who studied with Kyan for over 10 years each. Kyan is also noted for encouraging his students to visit brothels and to engage in alcohol consumption at various times.Okinawan Karate, Second Edition, Tuttle Publishing, by Mark Bishop, p. 73, Kyan was a participant in the 1936 meeting of Okinawan masters, where the term \\"karate\\" was standardized, and other far- reaching decisions were made regarding martial arts of the island at the time. Kyan survived the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, but died from fatigue and malnutrition in September of that year. See also *Pechin/Peichin  References  Further reading *Alexander, George.

It was a major factor in the development of the bossa nova style, also releasing samba, jazz, and spoken word recordings. It is often considered as one of the most influential labels in the bossa nova and MPB genres. Overview Producer Aloysio de Oliveira, a key figure in the internationalization of Brazilian popular music, founded Elenco in 1963. While the label is renowned for its output of bossa nova, Elenco's first releases were early MPB and Latin jazz, reflecting the tastes of its founder, who was also a musician. Musicians such as Baden Powell de Aquino (commonly known as Baden Powell), Astrud Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Maysa, L√∫cio Alves, and Sylvia Telles recorded stellar albums for Elenco, which are today considered as masterpieces of their genres. The most significant records were released between 1963 and 1968 and are instantly recognizable by their minimalistic sleeve artwork, designed by Brazilian photographer Chico Vilella, which often consists of a monochrome photograph or painting scattered with small red dots. According to critics such as Zuza Homem de Mello and Ruy Castro, the characteristic Elenco sleeve designs were heavily inspired by jazz labels such as Blue Note. These records are also noteworthy for the high-quality recording techniques used at RioSom studios in Rio de Janeiro by engineer Norman Sternberg. In the beginning, Elenco was a small label, based in Rio de Janeiro. During the mid-1960s a number of factors, including problematic distribution, caused the label to slide into insolvency; it was purchased by Companhia Brasileira de Discos in 1968. Many Elenco records have been reissued on CD, most notably in Japan. LPs are harder to find and are considered today to be highly-priced collector's items. ;Other artists who recorded for Elenco: Edu Lobo, Nara Le√£o, Vin√≠cius de Moraes, Maria Beth√¢nia, Dorival Caymmi, S√©rgio Mendes, Roberto Menescal, Tamba Trio, Odette Lara, S√©rgio Ricardo, Aracy de Almeida, Sidney Miller, Ciro Monteiro, Quarteto Em Cy, Rosinha de Valen√ßa and Lennie Dale.

History The town of Khariar is believed to be a feudal seat founded by Vishwanath Dev Gajapati of the solar dynasty. According to the Fifth Report on the Affairs of the Company, Vishwanath Dev built up an empire that stretched from the confines of Bengal in the north to river Godavari in the south up to Telangana. He built a new capital called Rayagada in order to effectively consolidate his position in all four directions of the domain. The report also mentions that innumerable feudatories paid service to the royal seat of Vishwanath who then adopted the title of 'Gajapati' to prove his dominance in the region. However, the Qutb Shahi Sultans of Golconda attacked the kingdom of Suryavanshis following the death of Vishwanath. His son, Balaram Dev, fought courageously but lost the battle to Ibrahim Qutb Shah and became a vassal state. In 1600, the Chauhan dynasty took charge of Khariar and Raja Gopal Rai who belonged to the Chauhan family of Balangir was crowned as the first king. In 1711, Jeypore suffered a grievous betrayal when its feudal seat of Vizianagaram joined hands with the French and instructed the feudal seats of Khariar along with Kalahandi and Bindra-Nowagarh to rebelliously join the Maratha forces and clinch independence from the Jeypore Kingdom. This led to the formation of the Khariar Zamindari that stayed until its dissolution in 1952.

Stabilimenta occur in more than half of constructed orbs, most commonly with two lines pointing up and down from the spider. If only one radius is constructed, it is mostly constructed above the spider. Some spiders build resting webs that are not used for prey capture. These also sometimes feature stabilimenta, suggesting that prey capture plays no role in its construction.

Like all Uloboridae, these species have no venom. Cooperation Some species (among them P. congregabilis and P. oweni) construct communal webs, but nevertheless do not capture prey cooperatively. However, a few species, such as P. raffrayi, are known to cooperate in prey capture. A colony of P. raffrayi is composed of individual orb-webs connected by non-adhesive silk. Its average body length is about 6 mm in females and 3 mm in males. Adult females are orange for at least a week after the final molt, and become black a few weeks later. In these colonies, Argyrodes and Portia species can also be found, acting as kleptoparasites and predators, respectively. When relatively large prey is trapped on the periphery of the colony, two females cooperate in about 10% of cases in wrapping it, which increases their chances of success about fourfold. However, only one female then feeds on this prey. Cooperative capture is similar in P. republicana, where more than two individuals may work together.Matsumoto 1998 Philoponella vicina uses its silk to compress and crush its prey.Eberhard, William G.; Barrantes, Gilbert & Weng, Ju-Lin (2006). \\"Tie them up tight: wrapping by Philoponella vicina spiders breaks, compresses and sometimes kills their prey\\".

Sir Richard was knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2007.http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/pressreleases/?pr=pr_070105 Current work In October 2007, Sir Richard founded \\"The Global Health Group\\" within UCSF Global Health Sciences. The Global Health Group is an ‚ÄúAction Tank‚Äù dedicated to bringing major new paradigms in global health through to large scale action. This entails analysis, policy formulation, and consensus building, followed by intensive collaborations with individual developing countries to achieve large-scale application of the new ideas. The Global Health Group is supported by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, ExxonMobil, and numerous other sources. The Global Health Group has three Initiatives; the Malaria Elimination Initiative (MEI), the Private Sector Healthcare Initiative (PSHi) and the Evidence to Policy Initiative (E2Pi). The MEI is dedicated to shrinking the malaria map by eliminating malaria from the endemic margins inwards. Under Sir Richard's leadership, a global Malaria Elimination Group (MEG) has been established. MEG had its first meeting in California in March 2008, its second in South Africa in October 2008, and its third in Switzerland in April 2009. Hainan, China, in December 2009; Huatulco, Mexico, in November 2010; Zanzibar, Tanzania, November 2011 and December 2012 in Al Ain, UAE. MEG VIII will return to California in October 2013. The MEI team is based in San Francisco and Southern Africa and has made a significant contribution to policy, science and practice in malaria elimination. The geographic focus of the work is primarily Asia Pacific and Southern Africa. The Global Health Group, in collaboration with the Australian Government, the University of Queensland, and WHO launched the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN) in Brisbane in February 2009. APMEN brings together 14 eliminating countries from the Asia Pacific Region to share experiences and co-ordinate policy. The second front of Feachem's Global Health Group is the PSHi, which focuses on studying and enhancing the role of the private sector in healthcare delivery in developing countries. Of particular interest is the model now known as the Public-Private Investment Partnership (PPIP) in which governments enter into partnerships with private consortia to finance and rebuild major health infrastructure and to provide clinical services over a period of decades. The Global Health Group has joined with PwC to document pioneering PPIPs in that Spain, Lesotho, Latin America, S.E. Asia, and elsewhere. A second model of special interest to the Global Health Group is Clinical Social Franchising. The fifth Compendium or Atlas on this topic was recently published by the Global Health Group. The third Initiative of the Global Health Group is E2Pi, which provides rapid turnaround policy options, based on comprehensive evidence synthesis, concerning current issues in global health. Clients have included the Gates Foundation, The Global Fund, GAVI, and UNITAID. The E2Pi is also playing a major role in the Commission in Investing in Health. Sir Richard and Winnie Mpanju-Shumbusho were both senior authors of a 2019 report in The Lancet about committing to the eradication of malaria across the world by 2030.

At present, it is Germany's second largest fusion experiment after stellarator Wendelstein 7-X.  Overview  To make experiments under reactor-like conditions possible, essential plasma properties, particularly the plasma density and pressure and the wall load, have been adapted in ASDEX Upgrade to the conditions that will be present in a future fusion power plant. ASDEX Upgrade is, compared to other international tokamaks, a midsize tokamak experiment. It began operation in 1991 and it succeeds the ASDEX experiment, which was in operation from 1980 until 1990. One innovative feature of the ASDEX Upgrade experiment is its all-tungsten first wall; tungsten is a good choice for the first wall of a tokamak because of its very high melting point (over 3000 degrees Celsius) which enables it to stand up to the very high heat fluxes emanating from the hot plasma at the heart of the tokamak; however there are also problems associated with a tungsten first wall, such as tungsten's tendency to ionise at high temperatures, \\"polluting\\" the plasma and diluting the deuterium-tritium fuel mix. Furthermore, as a high Z material, radiation from fully ionized tungsten in the plasma is several orders of magnitude higher than that of other proposed first wall components such as carbon fibre composites (CFCs) or beryllium. This result allows for far less tungsten to \\"contaminate\\" a proposed break-even plasma. ASDEX Upgrade will examine ways to overcome this problem, in preparation for the construction of ITER's first wall. The experiment has an overall radius of 5 metres, a gross weight of 800 metric tons, a maximum magnetic field strength of 3.1 tesla, a maximum plasma current of 1.6 megaampere and maximum heating power of up to 27 megawatt. Plasma heating and current drive in the ASDEX Upgrade is derived from several sources, namely 1 MW of ohmic heating, 20 MW of neutral beam injection, 6 MW via ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) at frequencies between 30 and 120 megahertz, and 2 x 2 MW of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) at 140 gigahertz. It has 16 toroidal field coils and 12 poloidal field coils. Three large flywheel generators feed the 580 MVA pulsed power supply system for the magnetic confinement and plasma heating. ASDEX ASDEX (with a major radius R=1.65m, minor radius a=0.4m, and plasma current Ip‚â§500kA) started operation in 1980.M.

History Point of divergence In our own universe, Hypatia of Alexandria was killed for her non-Christian views, shortly before the destruction of the Library by an angry mob. In this universe, Hypatia was converted to Christianity by John Chrysostom, and stopped the mob from destroying the Library. She continued her correspondence with John and St. Augustine, which eventually led to the modern (1530s) divisions of the Church. The Library was a great storehouse of magical knowledge‚Äîthe inference being that the information was lost to us in this universe when the Library was destroyed. In this universe, while magic is not commonplace its existence is no secret to the general populace and is practiced by those with the inborn power and/or discipline to use it. Notably, the clergy utilize elemental magic. Church in Europe Petrines Led by the Grand Metropolitan in Rome, the Petrine branch of the Church (named for St. Peter and built on the teachings of Hypatia and Chrysostum) is the creed of choice in Italy and Spain, with a relatively large following in Aquitaine. The Petrines are noted for taking a mediative role in politics and a more tolerant attitude to other faiths. Paulines Most of central and northern Europe follow the Pauline creed (named for St. Paul and based on the writings of St. Augustine). The Paulines are recognized for a general intolerance to all non-Christians, though some members of the Church are more politic about it than others. There is no official head of the Pauline church, though the Holy Roman Emperor is the \\"Bulwark of the Faith\\".

Queen Margaret is state-run by South Ayrshire Council and takes children aged 11 to 18 from the whole of South Ayrshire and parts of East Ayrshire. History  Origins of the school  The origins of the school can be traced back to 1831, when the first attempts were made to establish a school to educate Catholic children in Ayr. The original St Margaret's school was founded in 1856 on the site of what is now St Margaret's Church Hall in Elba Street, Ayr. Administered by the church authorities, money was tight, resources scant and discipline harsh. Years of determined hard work saw standards and pupil numbers rise. In 1893 the school moved to Whitletts Road, adjacent to Craigie Park, where over seventy-three years it developed from a purely primary to a combined primary and secondary school. An additional building and huts were erected in the early 20th century to cope with the rising school roll. After the Second World War such was the overcrowding that St Catherine's Primary School was built at Dalmilling to relieve the pressure. However, by February 1962 the lack of accommodation was still a serious problem. A fire destroyed one of the main buildings in the October of that year.  From St. Margaret's to Queen Margaret Academy  In August 1966, the secondary department moved to a new building in Mainholm Road, adjacent to Mainholm Academy, and was renamed Queen Margaret Academy; the primary department remained at Whitletts Road and was renamed St John's Primary School. When the lower school leaving age rose to 16, both Queen Margaret and Mainholm Academies outgrew their accommodation. Consequently, it was decided that Mainholm Academy should also occupy the entire site on Mainholm Road, and a new building be constructed to house the pupils of Queen Margaret Academy. Initially the site of the current Kyle Academy was considered, but felt to be too small. The school moved into the current buildings in Dalmellington Road in January 1976, and they were officially opened in 1977. Based on an experimental design, the teaching areas are located in one building with large open plan areas across for study and learning. The PE facilities, crush hall and dinner are in a separate building linked by a covered walkway. Attached to the school is the South Ayrshire Supported Learning Centre, which caters for pupils with specific educational needs.  New Queen Margaret Academy building  In January 2016 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the school to announce that a new building would be constructed to replace the current building. Construction began to the left of the site in December 2017 with the demolition of the Dance Area. The new building opened to pupils on 24 October 2019.

It was published in Poland by Wydawnictwo Literackie. The novel received the prime Polish award for science-fiction literature, Janusz A. Zajdel Award, in 2004. Dukaj himself wrote that he set out to write \\"a space opera to end all space operas\\", but for this he had to create a scientifically plausible and challenging universe, thus creating a hard science fiction novel.  The story  A 21st century astronaut, Adam Zamoyski, is recovering after an accident. At first, he thinks that he is recovering from a plane crash, and any bizarre things he perceives are hallucinations due to his convalescence. He soon finds out that to prevent him from suffering a culture shock‚Äîor perhaps what would be better described as a profound future shock‚Äîall information he receives is filtered through an implant, creating a semi-VR world, and in fact he was revived in the 29th century, in a post-technological singularity world. However, his implant becomes damaged, and he finds himself in a world where normal Homo sapiens are just relics. Most of the individuals he meets are artificial intelligence agents, scarcity has been eliminated through nanotechnology, virtual reality is merged with 'reality', the currency is exotic matter used in spacetime experiments‚Äîand suddenly Adam is caught in the web of a trans-galactic intrigue spin-doctored by beings vastly more intelligent than an unaugmented human. What is the secret that he presumably learned before his spaceship was destroyed back in the 21st century? The secret that he cannot remember, and that the science of the 29th century cannot restore, despite having resurrected him? And in a world where whole universes are dedicated to the sole purpose of serving as the weapon laboratories for the arms race between multiversal civilizations, can a normal human become anything more than a toy of inconceivably intelligent beings?  The universe  As with all of Dukaj's novels, the world of Perfect Imperfection is teeming with various concepts and ideas.  Remy's curve  This diagram (Remy's curve) shows the development of humanity in the Perfect imperfection. The vertical axis represents intelligence, the horizontal, adaptation, with the two points indicating physics and meta-physics. Translation of terms: * zwierzƒôta - animals * stahsowie - , Standard Homo sapiens * phoebe'owie - PHB's, Post-Human Beings * inkluzje - inclusions * Komputer Ostateczny - Ultimate Computer * Inkluzja Ultymatywna - Ultimate Inclusion * plateau - the ultimate communication network Remy's curve, which shows the course of the humanity evolution, is one of the most fundamental concepts in Perfect Imperfection. Dukaj used concepts of anthropic principle, technological singularity and transhumanism to propose a division of intelligence along the lines of intelligence and adaptation: * Standard Homo Sapiens are normal humans * Post-Human Beings is the next level of the evolution of human beings. Supported by artificial intelligence, one of the characteristics of a phoebe is its ability to divide itself into many copies with various levels, tasks and levels of autonomy, each of which can be tasked with analyzing and dealing with parts of reality. Another characteristic is the ability to transform both their bodies and minds. * Ultimate Computer is the computer using the best hardware as allowed by the physical constants of our universe. See also physics of computation. * Inclusions are in essence 'pocket universes'. They are created for specific entities to run hardware in a dedicated universe with physical constants different from ours, allowing for better performance than those in our universe * Ultimate Inclusion is the inclusion with the best possible set of physical constants in the entire multiverse The curve illustrates the relationship between intelligence (vertical axis) and adaptation (horizontal axis), where adaptation means the ability to use for one's own purposes the resources of the universe. It starts with animals and ends with the optimal form, the Ultimate Inclusion, able to utilize most efficiently all resources of the universe, both by perfecting their use of the resources and by adapting their form to the most efficient in their use. Named after the fictional scientist, Remy, this curve is supposed to be universal for all intelligent species throughout the multiverse. The adaptation axis is divided by two points (thresholds) into three thirds. The first third is the natural evolution. The first point, Autocreation or Physics, divides naturally evolved entities from those using technology to further evolution, but technology still limited by the physics of one universe. The second point, Meta-physical (it should be stressed - not metaphysical), divides them from logical inclusions, which use the 'better' physics of other universes to improve themselves. Note that Dukaj defines metaphysics as the science of changing physics (physical constants). One of the conclusions of Remy's theory is the Convergence Principle. After several centuries of evolution on second and third thirds, there is relatively little difference between various civilizations. Even if they have originated in different universes, each has spawned many subtypes, as alien to itself as any of those created by others, and in fact when they are approaching the Ultimate Inclusion they become more and more alike. First contact may be shocking and daunting for young civilizations, but for old ones, it is just a daily occurrence, with newly encountered races being no more surprising than the new youth fashion civilization seen a few years back. Many concepts important for are mostly irrelevant for phoebes (like gender) or inclusions (like age). are nonetheless preserved, allowed to live their lives and change into phoebes or inclusions at will, as due to elimination of scarcity and the ability to create new universes, there is no competition for resources (at least, for such as may be used by ).  Craft  Craft (or kraft) is the practice of meta-physics, the science of changing the physical constants, or shaping of spacetime through changing the laws of physics themselves.

It is situated on the banks of Harnav river. The town is connected with mythological history and has been pilgrim site for centuries. The 11th century Brahma, Ambika and Pankhnath Mahadev temples are the oldest monuments of the town. The town has two old stepwells, the Brahma stepwell and the Aditi stepwell. It was under Parmaras, Chaulukyas and Pariharas before it came under Idar State in 13th century. Etymology Brahmakshetra Mahatmaya mentions that Brahma had established the town so the region was known as Brahmakshetra, the land of Brahma. He ploughed the land here and a river had flown out of it which was later known as Harnav, a corruption of Hiranyaganga which was named after Hiranyagarbha, another name of Brahma. According to the inscription (Samvat 1256) in Aditi stepwell; the place was known as Brahmapur in Satya Yuga (1st age), Agnikhet in Treta Yuga (2nd age), Hiranyapur in Dvapara Yuga (3rd age) and Tulakhet in Kali Yuga (4th age). Brahmanotpattimartand mentions that the place was known as Brahmapur in Satya Yuga, Tryambakpur in Treta Yuga and Dvapara Yuga and Brahmakhetak in Kali Yuga. History left Brahmakshetra Mahatmaya (written after 10th century), the jnati-purana of Khedaval Brahmins, is a chief source of the mythological history of the region. It has 18 chapters. It was translated in Gujarati from Sanskrit in 1938. Ganpatishankar Shastri wrote Puratan Brahmakshetra in 1938 which traces mythological and literary history of the region in his book which is chiefly based on Brahmakshetra Mahatmaya. Mythological narratives describes that the place was associated with Brahma and Bhrigu. Bhrigu had done several yajna (sacrifices) here. The temple ruins of Shiva, Shakti and Surya outskirt of the town confirms it antiquity. Brahmanotpattimartand mentions Brahmakhetak town in south of Mount Abu. It also mentions Hiranya river, confluence of two rivers and Brahma temple housing statues of Brahma and his two consorts. Sabhramati Mahatmya of Padmapurana also mentions the town. The 15\\" long, 10\\" wide and 4\\" thick bricks were used in foundations of old temples and houses. They had crude finger marks which was a practise of Gupta period. So the settlement can be as old as 4th century. The Pankheshwar Mahadev temple was built in early 11th century which has statues of Shiva in one niche dated to this period. The Ambika temple was also built in early 11th century confirmed by the style of its phansana roof. The Brahma Temple was built in late 11th century while the Brahma stepwell was built in the 14th century. The inscription in Aditi stepwell is dated Samvat 1256 (c. 1200) which definitely proves historicity of the town. There are several old Jain temples in the region. Dalpatram has noted that Gadhaiya coins of Gupta period were found during the rebuilding of Nilkanth Mahadev temple near Brahma stepwell in Samvat 1912. Bhrigu Ashram and Kshirajamba temple are also of older origin. In 1930s, more than hundred Jain images buried in ground were exposed by rain which were later moved to Digambar Jain temple on Idar hill. The practice of burial of images were meant to protect them during raids. These images belonged to 12th century. The region was under Bhil king of Tarsang who was defeated by Parmara of Malwa. Later it was under Chaulukya dynasty of Patan. The region was later ruled by Parihar Rajputs and came under sway of Rao of Idar State in 13th century. Rana Meghaji, who came to power in Samvat 1474, had repaired the Brahma temple. In past, the fair was held in February which used to draw large number of pilgrims and traders from Gujarat and Rajasthan. The Kathiawar traders used to raise booths on the south bank of the Harnav river and deal in opium, cloth, copperware, jewelry, grocery, and horses. The fair used to last for fifteen days. Goods worth were sold. The fair lost its importance from the time of Rao Kalyanmal (about 1630), when the Idar State fell a prey to rebellion and disorder. Juvansinhji of Idar restarted the fair in Samvat 1917. In Samvat 1936, Kesharisinhji of Idar got Ambika temple repaired. In Samvat 1947, Gilabchand Manukchand of Vadali took a Sangh (procession) to Ambika temple and built rest house for pilgrims at cost of . In 1920, Daulatsinhji of Idar State order to give land surrounding the Ambika temple to the temple authorities. Between Samvat 1978 and 1987, thirteen rest houses for pilgrims were built near the temples by various donors. Himmatsinhji of Idar had built a hanging bridge on the Harnav river. The bridge was replaced by concrete bridge in 1959 and was expanded in 2017 at the cost of . During the British period, Khedbrahma was under the Idar State which was under the Mahi Kantha Agency until 1933 when it was included in the Sabar Kantha Agency. The Sabar Kantha Agency was merged with the Eastern Kathiawar Agency on 1 September 1943 which was subsequently merged in the Western India States Agency in 1944 followed by the Baroda, Western India and Gujarat States Agency (BWIGSA) in 1947. After the independence of India in 1947, BWIGSA was merged in the Bombay State and Khedbrahma fell under the Sabarkantha district. In 1960, Bombay State was later divided along linguistic lines in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Sabarkantha became part of Gujarat. Khedbrahma is the headquarter of Khedbrahma Taluka (sub-district). Geography The confluence of three small rivers (Triveni Sangam); namely Hiranyakshi, Bhimakshi and Kamakshi; is located here. These rivers are also known as Hiranyaganga, Bhimashankari and Kosambi respectively. Harnav river is also referred as Hiranyaksh or Harnai river.

Places of interest Brahma temple Idol of Brahma in TempleAccording to the Brahmakshetra Mahatmaya or Brahma Purana, this place owes its sanctity to a desire of Brahma to free himself from impurity. Vishnu, whom he consulted as to the means, advised him to perform a sacrifice at some holy spot in Bharatkhand in the Jambudvipa, and get learned Brahmin to officiate for him. Under Brahma's orders, Vishwakarma built a city on the right bank of the Sabarmati south of mount Abu, nine kilometres (4 kos) round. It had golden ramparts and twenty-four gates and through it flowed the river Hiranyaksh, the modern Harnav. He then created 9000 Brahmins to officiate at the yajna. And, when the sacrifice was over, and the impurity removed, to maintain his Brahmins, he created 18,000 Vaishyas and gave them Kshirja as their family goddess. Before withdrawing from the world, he let the Brahmins dedicate a shrine to him, and place in it his four-faced image.Brahma Vav Khedbrahma has a temple dedicated to Brahma which is rarely seen in India, only second to Pushkar. It was built in third quarter of the 11th century during reign of Chaulukya king Karna. This east facing temple is built of white sandstone and cement-covered bricks. It is fifty-seven feet long, thirty broad, and thirty-six high. The sanctum is 32 feet wide which is navaratha in anga and hastangula in plan and is of fully decorated class. Its pitha (base), the vedibandha and the mandovara (middle part of the wall) is resemble to the temple at Sunak. The spire, mandapa (dome) and doorway must have been destroyed which are rebuilt later in bricks and mortar. The lower part of main shrine is intact and is filled with images of gods, goddesses and apsaras. These images in jangha portion are poorly retouched. The chauri- barers on nandika are elegantly carved which are common in 11th century temples. The phansana roof resembles Vimala Vasahi temple and is crowned with a ghanta. There are images of Brahma in the niches on the three sides. The interior is devoid of any ornamental carving. The image of four faced standing Brahma is 1.8 m (5' 6\\") high and has two consorts on each side, Gayatri and Savitri. The image seems later installation or the older image plaster with cement to merge broken parts. Brahma stepwell There is a stepwell, situated opposite the Brahma temple, known as Brahma Vav. It is built with grey granite stone. It is constructed in east-west direction; the entrance is in the east and the well is in the west. It is 38.10 metres long; 30 metres of stepped corridor and the well of 8.10 metre diameter. The stepwell becomes narrower as one goes downwards and to the well. It has four kuta (pavilion- towers) where fourth is attached to the well. The breadth is 8.50 metres (including parapet wall) and 6.60 metres (without parapet wall) at the entrance which decreases to 5.4 metres in second kuta and 3.90 metres in the third kuta. It had row of miniature shrines as an ornamentation in the wall of shaft of the stepwell which suggests it was built in 14th century. There is no inscription in the stepwell to ascertain its age. They resemble temple spires and has niches. It has 27 niches without any idols now. It is now in despair due to lack of maintenance. There are some paliya (hero stone) dedicated to Dhabi gatekeepers of the village who died fighting Maharaja Shivsinhji of Idar around Samvat 1800. The inscriptions on them are worn out.  Aditi stepwell  Other historical stepwell, Aditi Vav is located on the north to the Brahma Vav on the way to Ambika temple. It was also known as Vikram Vav. An inscription dated Vaishakh Vad 1, Samvat 1256, Monday is present in the stepwell. The inscription states following: The stepwell was built by Vikram of Talukhet (former name of town) who was son of Nagshri and Someshwar. Nagshri was daughter of Vasudev who was in turn son of Vaman who were Brahmin of Shandilya Gotra and had done several sacrifices. Someshwar's grandfather's name was who was in turn son of Surdev who were Brahmins of Kaushik Gotra of Vishwamitra Kula. The inscription was written by local Brahmin Sarvadev and the stepwell was constructed under the architect, Shamal who was son of Devdhar. The inscription starts with respect to Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahman and Brahma followed by names of the town in each Yuga (era). The stepwell is considered sacred by Humad Digambara Jains and Khedaval Brahmins who worship their patron deities in the stepwell.  Ambika temple  Situated in north- east of the town, the Ambika temple was originally built in the early 11th century and renovated many time subsequently. It is also known as Nana Ambaji to distinguish it from Arasur Ambaji. The older parts of the modern temple belong to the 17th century. The temple is simple rectangular chamber with mukhamandapa in front. The base has an unusually thick jadyakumbha, a karnika and a plain pattika. It is followed by a vedibandha and a plain mandovara relieved by three niches, now empty. The temple is roofed by phansana topped by three ghanatas in a row, the form only seen in 11th century. The mukhamandapa has usual moulding of mattavarana. The square of temple was known as Chachar Chowk. The temple is north-facing. The older idols in the temple complex include Ganesha idol on the entrance and Hanuman and Kal Bhairava idols. Of Brahmani, Sarasvati, Tripurasundari idols; the first two were originally found during excavation for construction of the main entrance or the rest house. Every year many pilgrims come to Ambika temple especially during September‚ÄìOctober due to Bhadarvi Purnima festival. It is also known as Nana Ambaji Temple. There are fairs organised on full moon days in Hindu calendar months of Kartika, Chaitra and Bhadrapada. Pushya Purnima (full moon day of February‚ÄìMarch) is important because it is considered as a foundation day (Pragatya Divas) of the temple. The temple is also known as Nana Ambaji. Bhrigurishi Ashram There is also the Bhrigurishi ashram and a Bhrigunath Mahadev temple which is associated with folklores and Puranic stories. It is located in southeast of the town, on the south bank of the river and near the hillock. According to the Brahmakshetra Mahatmaya, the temple was built by Bhrigu, Brahma's son who was once sent by the seers, rishi, to find out who was the noblest of the Hindu trinity. Insulting Brahma and Rudra, they got angry and threatened to punish him. Seeking out Vishnu, Bhrigu was bold enough to place his foot on the god's chest. Instead of resenting, the kindly god asked the seer's pardon for the hardness of his breast. Bhrigu returned and praised Vishnu as the noblest of the gods. To wipe out the sin of insulting the gods, Bhrigu came to Brahma Kshetra, bathed in the Hiranyaksh, made his hermitage the seat of a Shiva, and performed such rigid austerities, that Shiva was pleased and freed him from his sin. Kshirjamba Mahalaxmi temple The temple dedicated to Kshirjamba or Kshetramba is located on the hill near the Bhrigurishi Ashram. According to the Brahmakshetra Mahatmaya or Brahma Purana legend, Kshirja was the family goddess of people created during the yajna of Brahma.  Pankhanath Mahadev temple  Near the confluence of rivers, on the north bank opposite the Bhrigurishi Ashram, there is an old Pankhanath or Pankheshwar or Pankshindra Mahadev temple dedicated to Shiva. It is west-facing plain simple temple which is restored several times. In the back-niche of mandovara of temple, there is a figure of Nataraja (Shivatandav) with eight hands which helps in deciding the dating of the temple. There is also one more Shiva figure in other form. The temple belongs to , built during reign of Bhima I of Chaulukya dynasty, contemporary of Sun Temple, Modhera. In the sanctum, there is a small protuberance instead of an elaborate lingam which is considered swayambhu (self-existent) by the devotees. According to the legend mentioned in Brahmakshetra Mahatmaya, the serpent king Pingal Nag had enmity towards the Garuda. He had taken a form of Brahmin to escape from the Garuda and hid in Brahmakshetra. He exposed his true form to his Brahmin wife on occasion of Nag Panchami. The Garuda came to know and there a battle between them. The wing of the Garuda was broken off in the battle and the temple was erected at the place of the battle to commemorate it and named Pankhanath. Other temples Kashi Vishwanath Mahadev Temple Hatakeshwar Hanuman temple located in old town is considered old. Near the Brahma stepwell, there is a Nilkanth Mahadev temple. There is an inscription dated Samvat 1912 about renovation of earlier temple. Kashi Vishvanath Mahadev temples is situated on the south bank of the river which are popular locally.

After his PhD, Green undertook a postdoctoral research year with Wilkinson before moving to the University of Cambridge in 1960 as Assistant Lecturer and being appointed a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1961. In 1963 he was appointed a Septcentenary Fellow of Inorganic Chemistry at Balliol College, Oxford and a Departmental Demonstrator at the University of Oxford. In 1965 he was made a Lecturer and he was also a Royal Society Senior Research Fellow in Oxford 1979‚Äì86. In 1989 he was appointed Professor of Inorganic Chemistry and Head of the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at Oxford and Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford. In 2004 he became an Emeritus Research Professor. He was a co-founder of the Oxford Catalysts Group plc in 2006. Green held many visiting positions including: Visiting Professor, Ecole de Chimie and Institute des Substances Naturelles, Paris (1972), Alfred P. Sloan Visiting Professor, Harvard University (1975), Sherman Fairchild Visiting Scholar at the California Institute of Technology (1981), and Walter Hieber Gastprofessor, University of Munich, Germany (1991). Green's earliest publications described metal-hydride and metal-olefin complexes, themes that he pursued throughout his career. Many of his early contributions focused on the chemistry of (C5H5)2MoH2 and the related tungsten derivative. These compounds were shown to engage in many reactions related to C-H bond activation. With Rooney, he was an active proponent of various mechanisms to explain stereochemistry in Ziegler‚ÄìNatta polymerisation. He used metal vapour synthesis, especially for the preparation of early metal sandwich complexes. He and his students synthesised several examples of complexes exhibiting \\"agostic\\" bonds.Brookhart, M.; Green, M. L.

The word was suggested to him by Jasper Griffin, professor of Classics at Balliol, whom Green asked for an appropriate Greek word to describe the close bonding phenomenon. This work would later lead to the so-called \\"modified Green-Rooney mechanism\\" for Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysis, wherein agostic interactions guide the stereochemistry of the alkene insertion step. This proposal found wide acceptance. His work on metal carbide catalysts led to the corporate spin-off company Oxford Catalysts plc, which became Velocys. Green along with Stephen G. Davies and Michael Mingos compiled a set of rules that summarise where nucleophilic additions will occur on pi ligands known as the Green‚ÄìDavies‚ÄìMingos rules.

Occupation Main occupation of people is agriculture here. People are dependent on agriculture, agriculture in this area is not dependent on rain because rain is very less in this region which is near 60cm annual. During kharif season mainly bajra is grown. Tube well is the main source of irrigation here which constitutes about 95% of total irrigated area. This is the reason why ground water level is gone very deep because of tubewells. Demand of canal extension of Agra Canal and gurgaon canal to this area from Bharatpur district is very crucial for this area. Main crops grown in this area are Wheat, Mustard, Bajra, Gram. And many fruits and vegetables are grown in this area. Because of medium yield the people are somewhat economically backward because they mostly depend on agriculture but they are not so much backward. That's why they don't mind so much because they earns enough to live happy. Besides agriculture nowadays, many people serves in govt. jobs from this area.

He was a Republican. The son of Governor J. Gregory Smith, Edward C. Smith also served one term as governor of the state. He was married to Anna Bailey James, the granddaughter of Amaziah Bailey James on October 3, 1888, and they had four children; James Gregory, Edward Fairchild, Curtis Ripley and Anna Dorothea Bradford. Early life Edward Curtis Smith was born into a political family. His father J. Gregory Smith became Governor of Vermont, and his uncle was Congressman Worthington Smith. His grandfathers were Congressman John Smith Senator Lawrence Brainerd. The Smith family was one of Vermont's most prominent, with business holdings in railroads, manufacturing and other enterprises. Edward Smith graduated from Yale University in 1875, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones Society. He received a law degree from Columbia University in 1877 and returned to Vermont to set up a law practice in St. Albans, Vermont. Business career Edward Smith succeeded his father as president of the Central Vermont Railroad. He was also president of Welden National Bank, and a founder of People's Trust Bank of St. Albans, and Sherman National Bank in New York City. His other holdings included an ammunition manufacturing company and various mining ventures. In 1876 Smith enlisted in Company D, 1st Vermont Militia Regiment, in which he served for several years. He served as a colonel in the Vermont Militia. Political career A Republican, Smith was elected as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives, serving from 1891 to 1892, and as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. In 1892 he declined the Republican nomination for Vermont State Senator from Franklin County. In 1896 he was a delegate to the Republican national convention. Election as governor In 1898 Smith received the Republican nomination for governor. As the Republican nominee in a state that elected only Republicans to statewide office from the 1850s to the 1960s, Smith easily won the general election. He served the single two-year term available to governors under the \\"Mountain Rule\\". (Under the Mountain Rule, the Republican party alternated candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor between the east and west side of the Green Mountains, identified nominees years in advance, and restricted governors to two years in office.) Smith was from the west side of the Green Mountains. His predecessor Josiah Grout and successor William Wallace Stickney were from the east. Republicans also apportioned the state's two U.S. Senate seats between each side of the Green Mountains. The Republican party maintained this rule, with few exceptions, for more than 100 years. They won every election for governor from the 1850s until 1960, and every U.S. Senate election from the 1850s until 1974. As governor from 1898 to 1900, Smith was a strong opponent of all efforts to regulate or tax corporations. In 1899 he officiated at the welcome ceremony in Bennington for Admiral George Dewey, hero of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Smith organized Old Home Week, the fair and festival designed to celebrate rural life and the Vermont roots of Americans living in other states. Later career After serving as governor, Smith returned to his railroad, manufacturing and banking interests. Smith was active in lineage societies such as the Society of Colonial Wars and the Sons of the American Revolution, and in the Vermont Historical Society. Honors In 1901 he received an honorary degree from Norwich University.

It was launched on 22 July 2001 as Proton‚Äôs first non-saloon, hatchback or coup√© model. The Juara was to be jointly developed by Proton and Mitsubishi Motors as an export model under the Mitsubishi badge. However, poor reception and lacklustre sales led to an early end to its production in 2004.  Etymology  The name Juara is the Malay language equivalent for Champion.  History   Pre-launch  Proton Juara (rear). The first sketches of a Proton MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) existed as early as the 1990s, during the dawn of the MPV era. During this period, all of Proton's offerings were either saloon, hatchback or coup√© vehicles. Proton began development of their first MPV, then codenamed 'Proton RGW', in late 1999. It was based on the Mitsubishi Town Box Wide platform, of which Proton had intended to re-engineer over the course of 2 or 3 years to suit different tastes. Mitsubishi Motors had also expressed intentions to rebadge the re-engineered Proton version as a Mitsubishi car for export markets. The joint development had aimed to lower costs for both companies, where Proton would be spared from paying royalties to Mitsubishi for the use of their platforms, and Mitsubishi would save on production costs if Proton were to re-engineer cars for them. Proton officially announced their MPV plans to the public in early 2000, and by November that same year, the first prototype had been completed. Production of the MPV began in the second quarter of 2001 at the HICOM Automotive Manufacturers Malaysia (present day DRB-HICOM) plant in Pekan, Pahang.  Post-launch  The Proton Juara was launched on 22 July 2001 at the Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) Esplanade. The launch was endorsed by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. The name Juara was only revealed on its launch date, and it was intended to pay tribute to the nation's sports champions of that period. The Juara was to be a niche product, and was deemed a 'lifestyle vehicle' as well as a Mini MPV by Proton. However, the Juara's unconventional kei car dimensions and van-like design was not well received by the Malaysian public. Nonetheless, the Juara's unique package makes it highly versatile and practical. It offers three rows and up to six individual seats, depending on the configuration. Both the second and third row seats can be moved, removed or folded with ease. The overall looks of the Juara remained largely unchanged over the Mitsubishi Town Box Wide which it is based on, bar the unique Proton corporate front grille, front bumper, bodyside mouldings and 14-inch alloy rims. The Juara also came standard with dual front power windows with anti- trap, power-adjusted wing mirrors, follow-me-home lights and a CD-radio player. The Proton Juara is powered by a 1.1-litre Mitsubishi 4A31 S4 4-cylinder EFI petrol engine which produces 71 hp or 53 kW of power at 6,000 rpm and 94 Nm of torque at 4,500 rpm respectively. Only a 4-speed automatic was offered. The Juara has a top speed of 135 km/h and a 0‚Äì100 km/h time of 18.1 seconds. Its suspension setup consists of MacPherson struts at the front and trailing arms in the rear. Proton claimed to have tuned the suspension for car-like handling based on expertise gained from Lotus. Uniquely, the Juara is one of only a handful of Proton cars to be rear-wheel driven (FR layout). The Juara also became the first Proton to feature Electric Power Steering (EPS). Safety wise, the Proton Juara came equipped with a reinforced body structure with anti-intrusion bars, as well as front ventilated disc brakes and rear drum brakes respectively. The brake line also has a load-sensing proportioning valve which prevents rear wheel lock-up on wet surfaces when the Juara is lightly loaded. However, there are no airbags or an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS). The Proton Juara was sold in four colours, namely yellow, silver, iridium and black, all of which have two-tone combinations on the bumpers and bodyside mouldings. The car was sold in several trim variants, of which the 1.1E was most popular, which retailed at around RM49,200 at launch. Its closest rival was the Perodua Kenari. The Juara's market performance was generally poor, with production stopping a few months after its introduction in July 2001. However, production resumed in mid-2002 with significantly reduced pricing, but sales remained unsustainable. Proton discontinued production of the Juara altogether in 2004. The car was never exported from its domestic market. On 15 April 2009, the Juara received a spiritual successor in the form of the Proton Exora. Unlike the Juara, the Exora has become a best-seller for Proton both domestically and in neighbouring export markets.

The books are written by three authors, Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint and Dave Freer. The books combine elements from the styles of all three authors, such as Lackey's approach to tolerance and magic and Flint's sense of history alteration. Plot summary In our own universe, Hypatia of Alexandria was killed for her non-Christian views, shortly before the destruction of the Library by an angry mob. In the universe of the novels, Hypatia was converted to Christianity by John Chrysostom, and stopped the mob from destroying the Library. She continued her correspondence with John and St. Augustine, which eventually led to the modern (1530s) divisions of the Church. The Shadow of the Lion (2002) deals with Chernobog's attempt to destroy Venice and the awakening of the city's ancient powers. Marco is the main protagonist, while Chernobog acts through several intermediaries. This Rough Magic (2003) is set in Corfu and features several new antagonists. It is largely centered on Maria and Benito's awakening, Marco having fit comfortably in his new role in Venice. Elizabeth Bartholdy has replaced Chernobog as the major behind-the-scenes villain in the book. A Mankind Witch (2005) is a solo effort by Freer, and takes place between Shadow of the Lion and This Rough Magic. While Manfred and Eric are major characters, the focus is shifted to a thrall, Cair Aidin, and the Princess of Telemark, Signy. Trolls are the major antagonists of the story. Much Fall of Blood (2010) follows Manfred and Erik after their journey to Jerusalem. While attempting to broker an agreement between the Ilkhan and their nomadic cousins, the Golden Horde, they stumble right into Elizabeth Bartholdy's latest and deadliest plot. Burdens of the Dead (2013) centers on Benito Valdosta's attempt to stop Chernobog's plots once and for all thanks after the revelations of Much Fall of Blood. The original working title was Great Doom's Shadow. All the Plagues of Hell (2018) by Eric Flint & Dave Freer Characters The following characters appear in two or more novels in the series: * Aldanto, Ceasare: Milanese sell-sword and spy * Bartholdy, Elizabeth: Hungarian countess and \\"aunt\\" to King Emeric. Hundreds of years old but appears to be in her early twenties. Engages in gruesome blood rituals to keep her youth. * Bespi, Fortunato: former Milanese spy; reprogrammed by the Strega to act as Marco's bodyguard. * De Chevreuse, Francesca: most powerful Courtesan in Venice, formerly of Orleans * Dell'Este, Enrico: The Duke of Ferrara; an excellent swordsmith, he is known as the Old Fox, perhaps the craftiest military mind Italy has seen in decades. * Dorma, Petro: Head of the influential House Dorma, leader of the Lords of the Nightwatch, and a frontrunner for the position of Doge. * Garavalli, Maria: A sharp-tongued canaler, one of the most feared women in the canals. * Hakkonsen, Eric: An Icelander, bodyguard and mentor to Manfred * Hohenstauffen, Charles Fredrik: Holy Roman Emperor * Evangelina: A member of the Hypatian order in Venice's St. Hypatia di Hagia Sophia. * Jagiellon: Grand Duke of Lithuania, possessed by the demon Chernobog * Lopez, Eneko: A Basque cleric and ecclesiastical magician. He is perhaps the greatest sacred magician since Hypatia herself. * Prince Manfred of Brittany, Earl of Carnac, Marquis of Rennes, Baron of Ravensburg: Nephew of the Holy Roman Emperor, second in line to the throne. * Montescue, Katerina (Kat): Heiress to the bankrupt House Montescue. Worked as a smuggler. * Montescue, Ludovico: Current leader of House Montescue, having wasted most of his money in a pathetic effort to destroy the Valdostas. * Valdosta, Benito: Grandson of the Duke of Ferrara; a pickpocket while in hiding. * Valdosta, Marco: Grandson of the Duke of Ferrara; a skilled doctor (when trained) and powerful mage; heir to House Valdosta and the Lion Crown. * Winged Lion of Venice: The city's ancient guardian, which answers only to the wearer of the Winged Mantle. The Church in Europe The Petrines Led by the Grand Metropolitan in Rome, the Petrine branch of the Church (named for St. Peter and built on the teachings of Hypatia and Chrysostom) is the creed of choice in Italy and Spain, with a relatively large following in Aquitaine. The Petrines are noted for taking a mediative role in politics and a more tolerant attitude to other faiths. The Paulines Most of central and northern Europe follow the Pauline creed (named for St. Paul and based on the writings of St. Augustine). The Paulines are recognized for a general intolerance to all non-Christians, though some members of the Church are more politic about it than others. There is no official head of the Pauline church, though the Holy Roman Emperor is the \\"Bulwark of the Faith\\". The Paulines very closely (with a few exceptions) resemble historical medieval Catholicism in faith, practice and politics. Magic The Church Most priests and Sisters of the Petrine branch of the Church are trained as magicians in the Vatican or Alexandria. They are typically trained in scrying, healing, and protection, though a number of them have taken up combative magic. The Order of Hypatia is a dedicated group of Petrine priests and Sisters who use magic to heal and protect. In the Pauline branch, only the Servants of the Holy Trinity are allowed to use magic (a fact which does not stop the Emperor from seeking a second opinion), and all forms of magic not sanctioned by them is heretical. Strega The Strega are magic-users and traditional witches who typically serve a higher purpose. In Venice, the Strega are welcomed, and about a third of the students at the Accademia are Strega or have Strega leanings. The Strega are led by a Grand Master, who is usually a Grimas (one who has mastered all three branches of Stregheira). Others The darker sides of magic are usually the antagonists of the series. The demon Chernobog, for instance, is the main villain, and his magical minions are the source of Venice's troubles. In This Rough Magic, King Emeric of Hungary is a witch, and a sect of sorceresses are the most powerful antagonists (their leader is the infamous Elizabeth Bartholdy). In A Mankind Witch, it is revealed that female Trolls have powerful magic. Nations *League of Armagh: a coalition of Celtic and Norse states. Most of their territory lies in the British Isles, however there are extensive settlements in Iceland and Vinland (North America). Manfred of Brittany is the heir to a part of the League as well as the Empire. *Aquitaine: A realm that encompasses most of our universe's France and England. Francesca de Chevreuse hails from the southern capital, Orleans. *Holy Roman Empire: ruling over all of central Europe, including Austria, Germany, and Denmark, the Empire is the most powerful nation in Europe, and adheres to the Pauline creed. Manfred of Brittany is an heir to the Empire, currently ruled by Charles Fredrik Hohenstauffen. *Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland: dominating most of eastern Europe, the Duchy is ruled by the iron fist of Grand Duke Jagiellon, who is possessed by the demon Chernobog. *Kingdom of Hungary: a brutal kingdom which has control of most of the Balkans. The current king, Emeric, is a warmonger who is not above using witchcraft to achieve his bloodthirsty ends. *Ilkhan: a vast empire implied to be the result of a merger between the Mongols and the Islamic Caliphate. They are known in Europe as the current rulers of Egypt and the Holy Land, enforcing the peace in Jerusalem by aggressively upholding a policy of religious tolerance. The full extent of their empire is not clear, but includes most of the Middle East and extends deep into Asia. *Genoa: The only rivals of the Veneze on the open seas, in terms of both trade and navy. *Milan: The Milanese and the Visconti house are the leaders of the Motagnards, staunch Paulines who are bent on the Empire annexing northern Italy. They are oblivious to the fact that this is the last the thing Empire wants. Caesare Aldanto hails from Milan. *Verona: Venice's land-based rival. *Ferrara: Like Venice, the Ferrarese are politically non-aligned, although they have served as agents for both the Empire and the Grand Metropolitan. Duke Enrico Dell'Este, grandfather of Marco and Benito, is known as the Old Fox. Venice The most trade-oriented and tolerant city in Europe. Venice is in possession of a large empire in the Mediterranean; in addition to its own home territories in Italy, the city also rules Istria on the Adriatic coast, Crete, the Greek island of Corfu, and unnamed territories in Sicily, Sardinia, and North Africa. The city is also known for its policy of tolerance‚Äîit is the only city in Europe where all manner of creeds can live together. Jews and Strega are among the persecuted minorities who find safe haven in the city. The Republic's government is ruled by numerous bodies and individuals: * The Doge is elected for a life term from all available candidates in the Senate. * The Council of Ten are the Doge's cabinet. Membership is a state secret. * The Lords of the Nightwatch serve as the heads of all \\"extra-military\\" matters of the republic, including but not limited to police work, detective work, security and espionage. * The Senate consists of three hundred dignitaries, merchants, and heads of House.

It is run by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and incorporates the older Inner Marsh Farm reserve. It lies near the village of Burton, about south of Neston. It has all been developed by the RSPB and includes a large area of mixed wetland habitats, bluebell woodlands, and arable fields all managed to attract wildlife. The reserve is open from 9am until 9pm (or dusk if sooner) and the reception hide is open from 9:30am until 5pm. There is a charge for non-members of the RSPB. History View over Inner Marsh Farm in 2007 The site consisted of tidal mudflats until the late 19th century when it was reclaimed during the building of the Wrexham to Bidston railway line. The resulting land was used for grazing and duck shooting and was later used for arable farming. The RSPB bought land for the original Inner Marsh Farm reserve in 1986 and the reserve opened in June 1992. Three shallow, freshwater pools were created as well as a footpath leading to a hide overlooking the pools. Because of restrictions from the local council, the RSPB did not publicise the reserve and access was originally for members only. The reserve was closed on Tuesdays for essential maintenance. There was a small car park at the end of an untarmacked road, signposted for Burton Point Farm, off Station Road. The reserve was enlarged by the purchase of land at Burton Marsh Farm in 2006 and Burton Mere Fisheries in 2008. New wetland areas were created along with additional visitor facilities including a reception hide, toilet block and a new entrance and car park. The reserve was renamed Burton Mere Wetlands in September 2011 when the new section was officially opened by the television presenter and naturalist Iolo Williams. Further paths and screens including a path linking the old and new sections of the reserve were opened in April 2014. Wildlife Birds include a variety of waders through the winter and migration seasons including significant numbers of black-tailed godwit, spotted redshank, greenshank and ruff. Winter also brings many ducks including pintail, shoveller, teal and wigeon, as well as small numbers of Bewick's swan and whooper swan. Birds of prey can be seen over the marsh, from the reserve or from nearby Denhall Lane; these include short-eared owl, hen harrier, marsh harrier, merlin, kestrel and peregrine falcon. Breeding birds include good numbers of nationally declining waders such as lapwing and redshank. Avocet also breed on the new pools. Yellow wagtail, skylark, sedge warbler, reed warbler, lesser whitethroat, grasshopper warbler and reed bunting all occur. A colony of little egrets and grey herons breeds in a nearby wood. Western cattle egret bred after an influx in 2017, and nesting attempts by great egret and Eurasian spoonbill were observed in subsequent years. Ten pairs of Mediterranean gulls nested on the reserve in summer 2019. Mammals on the reserve include harvest mouse, water vole and European hare. Daubenton's bats feed over the wetlands. Insects include the wall brown butterfly and the red-eyed damselfly. The pools on the reserve are surrounded by reedmace, sea club-rush, grey club-rush, soft rush and hard rush. Areas of damp grassland contain marsh foxtail, floating sweet-grass, creeping bent and soft rush. Wild flowers include marsh marigold and fleabane. Whilst wild orchids such as southern marsh orchid can be found in abundance, bee orchids are also present.

Later on, National Mineral Development Corporation, with help of Japan set up the first iron ore plant in Kirandul. Currently Japan is the biggest purchaser of its ore, but earlier it has also sold ore in Bhilai Steel Plant too. Kirandul was a crucial part of the princely state of Bastar before India attained independence. This town prospered under the reign of King Annama Deva, the brother of Kakatiya king Pratapa Rudra Deva of Warangal (Telangana). During the 19th century, the city came under the administration of the British rule. Eventually, it was acceded to the Indian Union on January 1, 1948, and the city became a part of the bastar district of Madhya Pradesh and later in 2000, it was included in the newly formed Chhattisgarh state.History of Kirandul City Chhattisgarh Origin- Background-Significance Economy Kirandul main road The iron ore mines here are also an important tourist attraction.

History  Kiratpur as a part of the district Bijnor shares the same history for most of the time period. It was ravaged by Timur in 1399, no documented evidence exists about it till the time of Mughal emperor Akbar, when it formed part of the Mughal Empire and so continued undisturbed, except for occasional raids, as long as the power of the Mughals survived intact. In the early part of the 18th century, however, the Rohilla Pashtuns established their independence in the country called by them Rohilkhand and about 1748 the Rohilla chief Ali Muhammad made his first annexations in Bijnor, the rest of which soon fell under the Rohilla domination. The northern districts including Kiratpur were granted by Ali Muhammad to Najib Khan, who gradually extended his influence west of the Ganges and at Delhi, receiving the title of Najib-ud-daula and becoming paymaster of the royal forces. His success, however, raised up powerful enemies against him, and at their instigation the Marathas invaded Bijnor. This was the beginning of a feud which continued for years. Najib, indeed, held his own, and for the part played by him in the victory of Panipat was made vizier of the empire. After his death in 1770, however, his son Zabita Khan was defeated by the Mahrattas, who overran all Rohilkhand. In 1772 the Nawab of Oudh made a treaty with the Rohillas, covenanting to expel the Marathas in return for a money payment. He carried out his part of the bargain, but the Rohilla chieftains refused to pay. In 1774 the Nawab concluded with the government of Calcutta a treaty of alliance, and he now called upon the British, in accordance with its terms, to supply a brigade to assist him in enforcing his claims against the Rohillas. This was done; the Rohillas were driven beyond the Ganges, and Bijnor was incorporated in the territories of the Nawab, who in 1774 ceded it to the British East India Company. From this time the history of Bijnor is uneventful until the Mutiny of 1857, when (on 1 June) it was occupied by the nawab of Najibabad, a grandson of Zabita Khan. In spite of fighting between the Hindus and the Muslim Pashtuns the Nawab succeeded in maintaining his position until 21 April 1858, when he was defeated by the British at Nagina; whereupon British authority was restored. Location Situated 400 km from the state capital Lucknow and 160 km from National Capital Delhi, this town lies on National Highway 34 between Najibabad and Bijnor. Lifestyle and living The population is predominantly composed of traders and small scale industrialists. Majority of population follows Hinduism or Islam. Both the communities have lived in harmony for a long time. There is nothing much for entertainment. People basically try to enjoy with physical entertained by playing a lot there. Cricket and volleyball has been very popular in the town and nearby villages.

History In 1884 the company was started by John Tunner Rubery (1849-1920) and his two brothers (Samuel 1844-1910 and Thomas William 1856-1925), as an ironworks manufacturing gates and fences. In 1893 the two brothers were replaced by a trained engineer Alfred Owen, and in 1903 the company name of Rubery Owen was established. When John T Rubery retired in 1910 his partnership was bought out by A E Owen and by 1912 the company had expanded into Aviation Engineering, Motor Frames and Roofing, in addition to fencing manufacture. Bristol 170 Freighter aircraft at Manchester Airport in 1952 The company expanded during the 1920s and 1930s to include the production of metal airframes, metal storage equipment, steel pulleys and armour plate. They also acquired a Warrington hydraulic company Conveyancer Fork Trucks Ltd which became Rubery Owen Conveyancer, and which claims to have launched the UK's first forklift truck in 1946. During World War II they concentrated on supporting the war effort, producing parts for military aircraft, and Brodie helmets. In 1956 they were designing and manufacturing aircraft landing gear. There was a large test rig where the wheel assembly was held, the wheel spun up to the equivalent landing speed and then dropped onto the \\"ground\\" to simulate the landing process. Measuring equipment recorded the stresses. Bolt heads of early Post War Rubery Owen production were marked simply with \\"RO\\", and then \\"Rubery Owen\\" was spelled out. These bolts made their way to any number of British factories building motor-vehicles, from automobiles to motorcycles. After the war they expanded their engineering products to include ploughs for Ferguson Tractors, metal pressings, fasteners, motor vehicle components and structural steel components for the building industry. In 1956 the company was structured into the following seven divisions: *Motor *Structural *Contracts *Bolt and Nut *Metal Assemblies *Metal Equipment *Rowen-Arc In the 1960s and 1970s Rubery Owen supplied many components and parts to the British motor industry but the most recognised is the Rostyle wheel (the word 'Rostyle' being a contraction of RO-Style). These were distinctive steel disc wheels pressed to a shape to give the effect of spokes. Rostyle wheels were common on British cars of the period both as manufacturer fitted options and aftermarket accessories. In 1977 Coventry Climax acquired the Warrington forklift truck business of Rubery Owen Conveyancer. In 1981 the main Darlaston works closed down. Rubery Owen is now managed by David Owen, and co run by Jim Owen. David Owen recently sold the building for ¬£1 to Walsall Housing Regeneration Agency (WHRA), a local charity who offers numerous projects based in Darlaston and surrounding areas.

Tourism   Mul Dwarka  Ancient city of Mul Dwarka Mul Dwarka (Kodinar), a small coastal village near Kodinar in the district of Gir Somnath, Gujarat State is one of the three claimants of the original Dwarka of Mahabharata. The proximity with hills on the north and sea on the south the town has been associated with all three Dwarkas (Sankalia, 1966). Lord Sri Krishna and Lord Balarama are supposed to have stayed here for sometime before moving to Dwarka. The remains of ancient port of Mul Dwarka have been much destroyed due to the construction of cement jetty. A tidal river, blocked by a sand-bar that may be caused by a cement jetty, flows on the western side of Mul Dwarka village. Archaeological findings from Mul Dwarka suggest that this area was an ancient settlement. Discovery of a composite stone anchor and report on some grapnel type anchors from Mul Dwarka support the view that this was an active port in medieval period and earlier. The artifacts found in and around this place date back to the 10th century AD and older as far back to the ages of Harappan and late Harappan settlements. An ancient temple of Lord Shree Krishna is situated on a raised land close to the sea. This small temple is in a dilapidated condition. The shrine is dated to the post 10th century AD (Sampura, 1968). And the Gujarat Government is planning a massive renovation of this temple complex. Kusheshwara Mahadev temple or Siddheshwar Mahadev temple, Bheedbhanjan Mahadev temple and Khodiyar Mataji temple are located nearby. A medieval age well is still used for drinking water source near the jetty.  Kaj  Kaj is 10 km east of Kodinar, on the Dwarka highway. Kaj has evidence of late Harappan settlements. An ancient mound is just 2‚Äì3 km east of the present village. It hosts Siberian birds that visit annually, providing a fresh water sanctuary. Archaeological explorations found many ceramic artifacts, including bowls from the Harappan period. Archaeological teamsery similar to those from ancient Dwarka and Somnath. All this indicates the existence of a Harappan civilization near the bank of the creek. Among the large number of Harappan pottery fragments, two large amphorae fragments suggest that Kaj might have been an ancient port on the mid Saurashtra- Kathiyawad coast, trading with boats from other countries‚Äîparticularly between Bet Dwarka (Gaur et al. 2005b and 2006) and Hathab (Pramanik, 2004). Topographical features indicate that in the past the ancient site of Kaj might have been approached through the sea route.  Kanjetar  Kanjetar is another coastal village that began as a historical settlement. Two mounds are near this village: one on the east side of the village, with a temple dedicated to Mahakali; and another about 2 km west of the village. Both entire mounds are under cultivation. A large quantity of Bronze Age pottery has been collected, which confirms a settlement in that period. Local residents say that digging house foundations has revealed many pottery fragments and structures. Archaeologists consider Kanjetar to be a Harappan port on the mid- Saurashtra. Exploration of the site found an ancient rock-cut step well near this settlement that may be contemporary to the site. Surface exploration found a terracotta wheel with a projection for a hub, probably from a toy cart. Other discoveries include an Indo-Arabian type limestone anchor under 4 m of water. It is broken, leaving only an upper portion with a circular hole. It is similar to those from other sites on the Saurashtra coast.

Traditional in Tuscany, these wines are often made from white grape varieties such as Trebbiano and Malvasia, though Sangiovese may be used to produce a ros√© style known as \\"Occhio di Pernice\\" or eye of the partridge. The wines may also be described as straw wines since they are often produced by drying the freshly harvested grapes on straw mats in a warm and well ventilated area of the house. (However, several producers dry the grapes by hanging on racks indoors.) Though technically a dessert wine, a Vin Santo can vary in sweetness levels from bone dry (like a Fino Sherry) to extremely sweet. While the style is believed to have originated in Tuscany, examples of Vin Santo can be found throughout Italy and it is an authorised style of wine for several Denominazione di origine controllata (DOCs) and Indicazione geografica tipica (IGTs).J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 752 Oxford University Press 2006 P. Domizio and L. Lencioni, Vin Santo. In Ronald S. Jackson, editor: Advances in Food and Nutrition Research, Vol. 63, Burlington: Academic Press, 2011, pp. 41-100. Origins of the name The most likely origin of the name \\"Vin Santo\\" was from the wine's use and association with the sacrament of the Eucharist. Although the style of making wine from dried grapes has been around almost as long as wine has been made, there are many theories on how the particular name Vin Santo or \\"holy wine\\" came to be associated with this style of wine in Italy. The most likely origin was the wine's historic use in the Catholic Mass, where sweet wine was often preferred.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 357, 387-388 Workman Publishing 2001 One of the earliest references to a \\"vinsanto\\" wine comes from the Renaissance era sales logs of Florentine wine merchants who widely marketed the strong, sweet wine in Rome and elsewhere. Eventually the term \\"vinsanto\\" became almost an umbrella name for this style of wine produced elsewhere in Italy. When the Greek island of Santorini came under rule of the Ottoman Empire, the ruling Turks encouraged the island's wine production of a sweet dessert wine made from dried grapes. Over the next few centuries, this wine became known as Vin Santo and was widely exported to Russia where it became a principal wine in the celebration of Mass for the Russian Orthodox Church.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 155, 414-422 Simon and Schuster 1989 Another claim is that when the island of Santorini was ruled by Venice, packages sent from the island were labelled ‚ÄúSanto‚Äù to denote their origin, while their contents were labelled \\"Vin\\"; thus the term ‚ÄúVinsanto‚Äù was born. Other, likely apocryphal, stories on the name's origin attribute its naming to the work of a 14th-century friar from the province of Siena who would use the leftover wine from Mass to cure the sick. The miraculous healing became associated with the santo or \\"holy\\" wine and the name \\"Vin Santo\\" was allegedly born.Chianti Vin Santo Wines of Tuscany, Chianti.com Accessed: 23 November 2009G. Harding \\"A Wine Miscellany\\" 108-110, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 Another 15th-century story involves John Bessarion, a patriarch of the Greek Eastern Orthodox Church. According to legend, at the Ecumenical Council of Florence of 1439 a local Florentine wine called Vin Pretto (pure wine) was served. After trying the wine, Bessarion is said to have liked it and remarked that it was like Xanthos, alluding to the famous straw wine of Thrace, (though some sources said he described the wine as Xantho or \\"yellow\\"). The Florentine locals thought they heard the patriarch describe the wine as Santo and they accordingly started promoting the wine as a \\"holy wine\\". Another oft-cited theory for the name association is the tradition of starting fermentation around All Saint's Day and bottling the wine during Easter week.L. Sonkin \\"Vin Santo: A Truly Great Dessert Wine from Tuscany, Fit for Saints\\" Into Wine, Accessed 23 November 2009 Production methods Barrels used for the ageing of Vin Santo are often marked with the Christian cross. After the grapes destined for Vin Santo are harvested in September or October, they are laid out on straw mats, often under rafters or staircases. They are kept in warm, well ventilated rooms that allow the moisture in the grape to evaporate. This process of desiccation allows the sugars in the grape to be more concentrated. The longer the grapes are allowed to dry and desiccate, the higher the resulting residual sugar levels will be in the wine. Depending on the style of wine desired, the grapes may be crushed and the fermentation process started after a few weeks or not till late March. Producers may use a starter culture of yeast known as a madre that includes a small amount of finished Vin Santo from previous years production. It is believed that this older wine can help jump start the fermentation process and also add complexity to the wine. After fermentation the grapes are then aged in small oak barrels. In many DOC regions, the wines are required to age for at least 3 years though it is not uncommon for producers to age their wines for 5 to 10 years. Traditionally the barrels were made of chestnut instead of oak, which contributed high amounts of wood tannins and was very porous which promoted excessive evaporation in the barrel. Under this same traditional style of winemaking, a large ullage or air space would emerge in the barrel and oxidation took place. This gave the wine its characteristic amber but also flavours and traits that may be characterised as wine faults. Towards the end of the 20th century, more producers began switching to oak barrels while maintaining the tradition of not topping up the barrels and filling in the ullage space. This angel's share still produces some level of oxidation, though not as severe as the style was historically made. Modern winemaking technique also calls for more temperature control and keeping the wine in rooms with a consistent temperature that promotes more fresh flavours in the wine and fewer faults. Some producers will still use non-oak barrels, such as chestnut, juniper and cherry wood and may even blend batches of Vin Santo aged in different wood barrels together. This has the potential of giving the wines more layers of complexity in much the same way that vinegar producers in the Emilia-Romagna region use different wood types to add complexity to their vinegar. As a fall back, if their wines become too oxidised or do not develop the way the producer wishes, some Vin Santo may be intentionally converted into vinegar that is very desirable in the culinary market. Wine styles paired with biscotti for dipping into the wine. The styles, colour, sweetness and quality of Vin Santo can vary widely depending on the grape varieties and production methods used to make the wine. While white grapes, such as Trebbiano and Malvasia in Tuscany, are most widely used, red grape varieties (such as Sangiovese) can be used to produce a ros√© style wine. When red grape varieties are used, the wine is often labelled as Occhio di Pernice, which has its own DOC classification in several regions of Italy. The wines can be made to fit any style of sweetness levels from bone dry, almost Fino Sherry-like, to extremely sweet and on par with the botrytised wines of France and Germany. The wines can even be fortified with grape spirit added during fermentation, like Port. These fortified examples are usually labelled as Vin Santo Liquoroso. The colour of wine Vin Santo can range from a pale to dark amber to even neon orange. The flavours typical of Vin Santo often include nutty or raisin notes with honey and cream attributes. In Italy it is traditionally served with biscotti that may be dunked into the wine. Wine regions For most of the 20th century, Vin Santo was often sold as basic vino da tavola due to Italian wine authorities' difficulties in classifying the many different styles of the wine. Today most of the major Italian wine producing regions have their own DOCs for specific Vin Santo wines produced in those areas. While the style is traditionally associated with Tuscany, examples can be found on the international wine market from throughout Italy. In the Trentino region, a dried straw wine made from the Nosiola grape is popularly labelled as Vino Santo. A noticeable difference between the Trentino and Tuscan examples is that the Trentino wines are usually less oxidised due to the wines regularly being \\"topped up\\" to prevent a large ullage. Tuscan DOCs While Vin Santo wines are produced throughout Italy, the vast majority of production takes place in the provinces of Tuscany.

Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 165 Hungry Minds 2001 Chianti DOCs A bottle of Vin Santo Chianti Classico DOC by Castello di Ama There are two main DOC regions that cover the production of Vin Santo in the Chianti zone. The Vin Santo del Chianti DOC overlaps with the entire Chianti zone and includes nearly every style and sweetness level of Vin Santo produced in Tuscany. Most of the Vin Santo that is sold on the international wine market is produced under this DOC designation. As with red Chianti wine, several village are permitted to add their names on the wine label as sub-zones. These sub-zones are Rufina, Montalbano, Colli-Fiorentini, Colline-Pisani, Colli-Aretini, Colli-Senesi and Montespertoli. White Vin Santo must have a minimum 16% alcohol level and is composed of at least a 70% blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia with other local white grape varieties permitted to make up the remaining 30%. The Occhio di Pernice style must have a minimum alcohol level of 17% and is composed of 50-100% Sangiovese with other local white or red grape varieties permitted to make up to 50% of the remaining amount. The wines are to be aged a minimum of 3 years prior to release with wines aged for at least 4 years eligible to be labelled as Riserva styles. The Colli dell'Etruria Centrale DOC is located within the geographical boundaries of the Chiant zones this DOC is a \\"catch- all\\" designations for alternative styles of wines that would otherwise not qualify for anything above vino da tavola. There are three distinct styles of Vin Santo that can produced under the Colli dell'Etruria Centrale DOC label- Occhio di Pernice, Abboccato and Amabile (also known as Secco). The first style, Occhio di Pernice, is a pale ros√© style wine made from at least 50% Sangiovese with a mix of local red and white grape varieties permitted to fill in the remaining 50%. The wine must have a minimum alcohol level of at least 10.5% and be aged for at least 3 years prior to release. The Amabile and Abboccato styles related to their sweetness level with Abbocato designating a slightly sweet (or \\"off dry\\") style and Amabile designating a wine that is sweeter but not quite as sweet as something that would be labelled as Dolce. These wines must have a minimum alcohol level of 15% and be aged for at least 3 years prior to release. If a Vin Santo is aged for 4 years, it qualifies to be labelled as Riserva wine. Both the Amabile and Abboccato wines must be composed of at least a 70% blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia with local grape varieties permitted to fill in the remaining 30%. Related DOCs Vin Santo is served with dessert, generally traditional biscuits. Offida DOC in Marche, includes 19 comuni within the region but only 2 are allowed to produce Vin Santo. The wine must have a minimal alcohol content of 12% and be aged for at least 3 and half years prior to release. The wine must be composed of at least 85% of Passerina with the remaining 15% coming from local white grape varieties. Trentino DOC is a large province wide DOC covering the entire province of Trentino. The Vino Santo sub-zone (not to be confused with Vin Santo wine) covers the Valle dei Laghi area, using 100% Nosiola grapes air-dried for up to 6 months when they become affected by noble rot. Vinification takes up to 3 years to reach 12-13% abv. Most producers age the wine for 7-10 years but the minimum is 3 years. Vino Santo is one the most prestigious dessert wines in Italy.

Located at 75th Street and Jamaica Avenue in Woodhaven, Queens, it is served by the Z train during rush hours in the peak direction and by the J train at all other times.  History  This station opened on May 28, 1917 under the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad, an affiliate of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. In the late 1980s, the Elderts Lane end of the station had a mezzanine area, but it was closed, and had become a haven to drugs and prostitution, so the staircases to the south end of the station were removed. When it was found that people were still getting into the closed mezzanine, the entire mezzanine area was dismantled, leaving the only exit and entrance to the station on the north side (75th Street). It was reported in Newsday on February 20, 1988 that the mezzanines at Elderts Lane, Forest Parkway and 104th Street stations would be torn down.Newsday (New York), February 20, 1988, Saturday, CITY EDITION, \\"Less Money for TA Means Fewer Fixes Will Be Made,\\" by Bob Liff, p. 2  Station layout This elevated station has two side platforms and two tracks with space for a center track. The station is centered between Eldert Lane and 75th Street. The eastern end (railroad north) end of the station is just east of 75th Street is in Queens while the western end (railroad south) lies over the west side of Eldert Lane. Since this portion of Eldert Lane lies on the border between Brooklyn and Queens, most of the station is in Queens, with a small portion of it in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn. The MTA counts the station as being in Queens. The New York City GIS portal labels the station as \\"75th St‚ÄìEldert Ln\\", with the \\"s\\" removed from \\"Elderts,\\" matching the current name of the street. (The street name has evolved from Eldert's Lane to Elderts Lane to the current Eldert Lane, which gives rise to the discrepancy between the MTA naming and the street name.) Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies supported by green frames and support columns along their entire lengths except for a small section at the south end. Here, they have black steel waist high fences with lampposts at regular intervals. The 1990 artwork here is called Five Points of Observation by Kathleen McCarthy. It affords a view of the street from the platforms and resembles a face when seen from the street. This artwork is also located in four other stations on this line. Exits This station has one elevated station house beneath the tracks. A single staircase from the east end (railroad north) of each platform goes down to a waiting area/crossover, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the station.

As of 2011 the municipality had a population of 23,227 and a metropolitan population of 47,007. History Colachel is an ancient port town, that Vasco da Gama called ‚ÄòColachi‚Äô. Before the State re- organization in 1956, it was part of the Travancore State. After the defeat of the Dutch by King Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma in 1741, a victory pillar had been erected near the beach in commemoration of the victory.

It was the first time in Indian history that an Asian country defeated a European naval force.The Hindu ‚Äî A different battle at Colachal The Dutch marines landed in Colachel with artillery and captured the land up to Padmanabhapuram, then the capital of Travancore. The arrival of Marthanda Varma from the north forced the Dutch to take up defensive positions in Colachel, where they were attacked and defeated by the Travancore forces. Twenty-eight high level Dutch officers, including Admiral D'lennoy, were captured. The defeat of the Dutch in Colachael was the turning point of the Travancore-Dutch War. D'lennoy went on to serve the Travancore kingdom for the next two decades and was promoted to the post of the Valiya kappithan (Senior Admiral) of the Travancore forces. He modernised the Travancore army, and built the Nedumkottai, a line of fortifications in the north of the kingdom, which held up the army of Tipu Sultan in 1791, during his ill-fated invasion of Travancore. D'lennoy is buried in the Udayagiri Fort, also known as Dillanai kottai (D'lennoy's fort) which is located 7 kilometres north of Padmanabhapuram (about 14 kilometres from Nagercoil). 2004 Tsunami The December 2004 tsunami of the Indian Ocean caused huge devastation and damages.

Cumbria within England The history of Cumbria is marked by a long and complex history of human settlement. Geographically, Cumbria is situated near the centrepoint of the British Isles. The contrasting landscapes between the mountains and the fertile coastal areas and the rich variety of mineral resources available in the county have made it a desirable area for habitation since the Upper Paleolithic, and various ethnic groups have been drawn to the area, leaving their linguistic mark since the Iron Age. Linguistic influences Sources Whaley provides a summary of the history of linguistic influences on, plus a dictionary of, the place-names of the area covered by the Lake District National Park, plus entries for Kendal, Cockermouth and Penrith, Cumbria. The five much earlier volumes of the English Place-Name Society cover the whole of the former counties of Cumberland, and Westmorland. Ekwall covers Lancashire, the northern part of which now lies within Cumbria. Brythonic General distribution of Brittonic elements Since at least the Iron Age, the inhabitants of Cumbria would have spoken Common Brittonic, which is the ancestor of modern Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. Evidence of this language is mostly visible in topographical features such as rivers (Kent, Eden, Ehen, Levens) and mountains (Blencathra, Helvellyn, Coniston Old Man). In the first millennium AD the Brythonic spoken in north west England and southern Scotland developed into a separate strain called Cumbric, which included some influences from Latin picked up during the Roman occupation of Britain. It is likely that most place names with Brythonic influences have survived from this time (Carlisle, Penrith, Penruddock) British influenced place names exist throughout the whole county, but are particularly common around the river valleys of the Lake District and around the coastal plains of the Solway Firth. Common Brythonic elementsBased on forms given by A.D Mills in Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names (2003) blain (Welsh blaen) - 'summit' ‚Üí blen- cair (Welsh caer) - 'fort' creic, *carrek (W. craig, carreg) - 'rock' ‚Üí crag din (W. din) - 'fort' penn (W. pen) - 'hill', 'head' Old English General distribution of Old English elements Angles from Deira and Bernicia (later Northumbria) would have gradually filtered into Cumbria since the 5th century, but the area retained a distinctly British identity until at least the 8th century. Settlement by the English began in the north, with settlers following the line of Hadrian's Wall and traversing Stainmore Pass then settling the Eden Valley before making their way along the north coast. Some time later they would have begun to move into the Kent Valley, Cartmel and Furness, gradually moving further north along the west coast. Surviving place names have been taken to show that the Anglo-Saxons stayed out of the mountainous central region and remained in the lowlands,Armstrong, A. M., Mawer, A., Stenton, F. M. and Dickens, B. (1952) The Place-Names of Cumberland. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. but after the Celtic kingdom of Rheged was annexed to English Northumbria sometime before 730 AD, the Celtic language of Cumbric was slowly replaced by Old English .Jackson, K. H. (1953). 'Language and history in early Britain: A chronological survey of the Brittonic languages, first to twelfth century A.D'., Edinburgh: University of Edinburgh Press. As a result, Old English elements can be found throughout the county, but mostly in the names of towns and villages (Workington, Millom). Very few rivers or mountains contain Old English elements (Eamont, Stainmore), but many of the lakes contain the element mere, meaning 'lake'. Common Old English elements *hƒÅm - 'homestead, village, manor, estate' *-inga- - 'belonging to the sons or people of...' *mere, m√¶r(e) - 'pond, lake' ‚Üí mere *t≈´n - 'farmstead, enclosure, village'' *wƒ´c - 'settlement, farm' (from Latin vicus, often found near Roman roads) ‚Üí -wick, -wich Old Norse General distribution of Old Norse elements The Norse appear to have arrived in Cumbria in about 925 AD and left a huge impression upon the toponymy of Cumbria. Originally from Norway, it is generally accepted that they would have come here via their colonies in Iceland, Ireland and the Isle of Man, perhaps bringing with them a touch of Gaelic influence. Placenames with thwaite, which are commonplace in Cumbria, are also abundant in the southern counties of Hordaland, Rogaland, Agder and Telemark in Norway proper, and less in use elsewhere (Norwegian: tveit, tvedt). It seems they would have arrived around the south west of the county and penetrated into the uplands of the central region where the Old Norse influence is dominant. Many mountains, rivers and valleys have Norse names, as attested by the abundance of the elements fell, -ay and dale (Mickledore, Scafell, Rothay, Duddon, Langsleddale, Allerdale). Many town and villages also contain Norse elements (Keswick, Whitehaven, Ravenglass, Silloth, Ulverston, Ambleside) Common Old Norse elements *√° - 'river' *bekkr - 'stream' ‚Üí beck *dalr - 'valley' ‚Üí dale *fors - 'waterfall' ‚Üí force/foss *fjall - 'mountain' (usually a large, flat mountain) ‚Üí fell *gil - 'ravine' ‚Üí gill, ghyll *haugr - 'hill' ‚Üí howe *holmr - 'island' ‚Üí holme *intaka - 'intake' *pic - 'peak' ‚Üí pike *s√¶tr - 'shieling' ‚Üí side, seat *tjorn - 'small lake' ‚Üí tarn *√æveit - 'clearing' ‚Üí thwaite *t√∫n - 'farm' There are also a number of Danish influenced place names (Allonby, Thursby, Ousby, Milnthorpe), but the majority are situated along the Eden Valley and the north coast of the county, suggesting that they might have come across Stainmore around the 9th century AD. Common Danish elements *by - 'home' (may be Old Norse, but more often Danish) *√æorp - 'secondary settlement' ‚Üí thorpe Goidelic Celtic and Irish influence Some names show evidence of Irish or Norse-Gaelic influence (Kirksanton, Ireleth, Ireby). Several Gaelic Saints are recalled in Cumbrian place names, including St. Bega, St. Brigid, and St. Sanctan. The influence of the early Celtic Church in Northumbria and Cumbria was considerable. Anglo- Norman and Middle English At the time of the Norman conquest in 1066, it is likely that a mixture of Norse and Old English would have been spoken throughout most of Cumbria, which persisted until the spread of Middle English after the 12th century. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists only a few places in the south of the region, as at this time most of northern and central Cumbria was part of Scotland, but with several battles over the following centuries the whole area became part of England. The influence of Anglo-Norman is usually confined to manorial names and residences and often include a personal name to distinguish between two places belonging to different lords (Egremont, Beaumont, Maulds Meaburn, Crosby Garret, Ponsonby, Grange). Although it is often difficult to distinguish between a Middle English name and an earlier one, some places do seem to contain elements (Tod Ghyll, Brocklebank, Ladyholme, Cam Spout, Monk Coniston, Newlands, Sweden Bridge) Common Anglo- Norman and Middle English elements *grange - 'farm' (usually belonging to a monastery) *great - 'large' (denoting the larger of two places) *ground - (denoting land belonging to a person, divided from monastic lands after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536) *little - (denoting the smaller of two places) *monk - (referring to land belonging to a monastery, usually Furness Abbey) *mont - 'hill' Modern names Several places in Cumbria have been renamed in more recent times, (Belle Island, Maryport, Longtown, Sprinkling Tarn)  Examples   Abbreviations used in the following descriptions  OE Old English ON Old Norse Da Danish Br Brythonic Celtic Go Goidelic Celtic Ir Irish Sc Scottish AN Anglo-Norman  Areas  *Allerdale 'valley of River Ellen' *Copeland 'bargained land, bought land' from ON kaupa land *Cumbria 'land of the Cymry' (the Brythonic name for the British people of the area, related to Welsh Cymru, from a Brittonic *kombrogi meaning 'fellow countrymen'). *Cumberland 'land of the Cymry' from the OE Cumbra land *Furness 'further promontory' from OE fu√∞or and ON nes, the oldest form of the name is Fu√æ√æernessa (c1150) *Grizedale Forest 'valley with pigs' from ON gris dalr *Morecambe Bay 'crooked sea' from Br *mori- & *kambo-.Rivet, A.

It is served by the J train at all times. The Z train skips this station when it operates. History This station was opened on May 30, 1893 as part of the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad's four stop extension of the Lexington Avenue Line to Cypress Hills. The original Cypress Hills station had two tracks and one island platform and was located along Crescent Street, reaching the cemetery. This station was the terminal for both the Jamaica Line and the BMT Lexington Avenue Line when it opened.http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?113358 It formerly had an island platform and stub-end located directly along Crescent Street just south of Jamaica Avenue that can still be seen approaching the cemetery east of the station. The rebuilt station was constructed under the Dual Contracts and was opened on May 28, 1917. The rebuilt station has two tracks and two side platforms. The removal of the island platform resulted in a space between the tracks. This space would allow for an express third track, but one was never built. Lexington Avenue Line service terminated in October 1950, but Jamaica Line trains continued to serve the station.  Station layout Northbound platform This is the northernmost station in Brooklyn on the BMT Jamaica Line, since the next stop, , is in Queens. Both platforms have beige windscreens and green canopies with brown roofs that run along the entire length. Just west of this station are two sharp curves that trains must navigate at less than . For this reason, a train must take more time to transverse this section than other sections of the line. The 1990 artwork here is called Five Points of Observation, by Kathleen McCarthy. It affords a view of the street from the platforms and resembles a face when seen from the street. This artwork is also located in four other stations on the Jamaica Line. Exits The station's main entrance is at the south end. A single staircase from each platform leads to an elevated station house beneath the tracks. Inside are three turnstiles and a token booth. Outside of fare control, two street stairs lead to the corners of Hemlock and Crescent Streets.  On the north end of each platform, a single staircase leads to a landing outside of a now closed station house. On the Queens-bound platform, a single exit-only turnstile provides exit from the system and a street stair perpendicular to the line leads to Autumn Avenue, which ends at Jamaica Avenue. The exit on the Manhattan-bound platform was closed, and the street stair was removed.

The planet orbits the solar analog star, Upsilon Andromedae A, approximately every five days. Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non- resolved planets to be detected directly. Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars.

The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al- Saffar of Muslim Spain.NameExoWorlds The Approved Names  Discovery  Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae's spectrum. The planet's existence was announced in January 1997, together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Bo√∂tis. Like 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star, closer than Mercury does to our Sun. The planet takes 4.617 days to complete an orbit, with a semimajor axis of 0.0595 AU. (web version) A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found. The true mass may be much greater depending on the inclination of the orbit. A mass of and an inclination of 24¬∞ were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy.  Physical characteristics  Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface. The Spitzer Space Telescope measured the planet temperature, and found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1,400 degrees Celsius, ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1,400 to 1,650 degrees Celsius. The temperature difference has led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A. Sudarsky had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, predicted Upsilon Andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere. The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun's radiation; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides, but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The chemical elements in the atmosphere can be studied by finding their absorption lines in the thermal spectrum of the planet; given typical planet temperatures, the spectrum has its peak at infrared wavelengths. So far, only water vapor has been detected in this planet, while carbon monoxide and methane are still under the detection limit. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system. The planet (with 51 Pegasi b) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Planetpol. Preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color, is 1.36 times as large and 0.74 times as massive as Jupiter, meaning that the mean density is 0.36g/cm3. It has a geometric albedo of 0.35 in visible light. Tidal heating models predict a similar mass for the planet.  Effect on the parent star  Artist's impression of the hot spot, shown in orange hues. Upsilon Andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star. Observations suggest that there is a \\"hot spot\\" on the star around 169¬∞ away from the sub-planetary point. This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star. The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of RS Canum Venaticorum variable stars, or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io.

This was done by making precise measurements of the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Upsilon Andromedae A. At the time of discovery, Upsilon Andromedae A was already known to host one extrasolar planet, the hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b, however by 1999 it was clear that the inner planet could not explain the velocity curve. In 1999, astronomers at both San Francisco State University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics independently concluded that a three-planet model best fit the data. The two new planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae c and Upsilon Andromedae d. Orbit and mass Like the majority of long-period extrasolar planets, the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c is eccentric, more so than any of the major planets in the Solar System (including Pluto). (web version) If placed in the Solar System, Upsilon Andromedae c would lie between the orbits of Earth and Venus. The high orbital eccentricity may be the result of gravitational perturbations from the planet Upsilon Andromedae d. Simulations suggest that the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c returns to its original circular state roughly once every 9,000 years. One proposal is that interactions between Upsilon Andromedae d and a (now lost) outer planet moved Upsilon Andromedae d into an orbit closer to the star, where it gradually caused the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c to become eccentric. If so, the rogue planet would have had to eject immediately. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae c is that the orbital inclination is unknown, and only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. However, by combining radial velocity measurements from ground-based telescopes with astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have determined the orbital inclination as well as the actual mass of Upsilon Andromedae c, which is about 13.98 times the mass of Jupiter. The mutual inclination between c and d is 29.9 degrees. Characteristics Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae c is a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet has only been detected indirectly through observations of its star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Since its actual mass is approximately 14 times that of Jupiter, and its star's metallicity is similar to that of the Sun, Upsilon Andromedae c may actually be a small brown dwarf.

It has a temperature of .http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_ups_And_d.png It has a mass of 10.25 and a likely radius of around 1.02 based on its mass. Host star The planet orbits a (F-type) star named Upsilon Andromedae A. The star has a mass of 1.27 and a radius of around 1.48 . It has a temperature of 6074 K and is 3.12 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is slightly metal- rich, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of 0.09, or about 123% of the solar amount. Its luminosity () is 3.57 times that of the Sun. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 4.09. Therefore, Upsilon Andromedae can be seen with the naked eye. Orbit Upsilon Andromedae d orbits its star nearly every 3.5 years (about 1,276 days) in an eccentric orbit, more eccentric than that of any of the known planets in the Solar System. (web version) To explain the planet's orbital eccentricity, some have proposed a close encounter with a now-lost outer planet of Upsilon Andromedae A. The encounter would have moved planet \\"d\\" into an eccentric orbit closer to the star and ejected the outer planet. Habitability Artist's impression of a potentially habitable exomoon orbiting a gas giant. Upsilon Andromedae d lies in the habitable zone of Upsilon Andromedae A as defined both by the ability for an Earthlike world to retain liquid water at its surface and based on the amount of ultraviolet radiation received from the star. For a stable orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary and that of the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Upsilon Andromedae d, the orbital period would have to be no greater than 120 days (around 4 months) in order to have a stable orbit. Tidal effects could also allow the moon to sustain plate tectonics, which would cause volcanic activity to regulate the moon's temperature and create a geodynamo effect which would give the satellite a strong magnetic field. To support an Earth-like atmosphere for about 4.6 billion years (the age of the Earth), the moon would have to have a Mars-like density and at least a mass of 0.07 . One way to decrease loss from sputtering is for the moon to have a strong magnetic field that can deflect stellar wind and radiation belts. NASA's Galileo's measurements hints large moons can have magnetic fields; it found that Jupiter's moon Ganymede has its own magnetosphere, even though its mass is only 0.025 . Discovery and further studies Upsilon Andromedae d was detected by measuring variations in its star's radial velocity as a result of the planet's gravity. This was done by making precise measurements of the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Upsilon Andromedae A. At the time of discovery, Upsilon Andromedae A was already known to host one extrasolar planet, the hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b; however, by 1999, it was clear that the inner planet could not explain the velocity curve. In 1999, astronomers at both San Francisco State University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics independently concluded that a three-planet model best fit the data. The two new planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae c and Upsilon Andromedae d. Preliminary astrometric measurements suggest the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae d may be inclined at 155.5¬∞ to the plane of the sky. However, these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits; , and contradict even the inner planet u And b's inclination of >30¬∞. The mutual inclination between c and d meanwhile is 29.9 degrees. The true inclination of Upsilon Andromedae d was determined as 23.8¬∞ after combined results were measured from the Hubble Space Telescope and radial velocity measurements. When it was discovered, a limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae d is that the orbital inclination is unknown, and only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained, which was estimated to be about 4.1 times as massive as Jupiter. However, by combining radial velocity measurements from ground-based telescopes with astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have determined the orbital inclination as well as the actual mass of the planet, which is about 10.25 times the mass of Jupiter.

Demographics India census, Konanakunte had a population of 13,262. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Konanakunte has an average literacy rate of 77%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 81%, and female literacy is 73%. In Konanakunte, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. Konanakunte's population has not been mentioned in the 2011 census. As it is now under the limits of the BBMP, the area's population has been integrated with the population of Bangalore. Brief Description Over the last two decades, Konanakunte has undergone transition from a secluded area on the city's outskirts having only graveyards and grape wines to a partially developed, semi urban residential area. The name \\"Konanakunte\\" likely means \\"buffalo pond\\". Harijan colony in Konanakunte, a small area occupied by slum dwellers had a natural pond, which was put into use as a source of drinking water for buffalos. The vast portion of Konanakunte was filled with cultivation of crops such as avarekai, huchellu & ragi to name a few. It gained popularity during the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in early 1990s. The main accused Shivarasan along with his aides was found to be hiding here. The only landmark in the area was the huge Khoday's factory, employing local people. Over the years, Konanakunte has experienced a great deal of development in terms of population infrastructure and urbanization. But urbanization has brought along with it the evils such as improper civic amenities and security issues. The area has come under the influence of cosmopolitan life but without forgoing the characters of a typical Indian village. The city of Bangalore is attracting immigration from all parts of the country. Konanakunte once known as the sleeping village on the city's outskirts known only for farming and underemployment is today a sprawling locality with people of various origins making it their home. The main attraction in this colony and the crux of the issue is the booming real estate opportunities. Thousands of hectares of land in and around Konanakunte has been converted into residential layouts and the value of land had gone up in geometrical proportions. In spite of the area attracting inhabitants and business, civic amenities are as low as it could be infrastructure like stable roads; drainage, streetlights, security and medical facilities are not in place. Soon with the completion of the ambitious Namma Metro project, Konanakunte will become much more easily accessible and hence it is foreseen that a further surge in the population of this area will occur.

Located at the intersection of Crescent and Fulton Streets in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, it is served by the J train at all times and the Z during rush hours in the peak direction. History This station was opened on May 30, 1893 as part of the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad's four stop extension of the Lexington Avenue Line to Cypress Hills. This station was renovated in 2007. As part of the station renovation project, the stairs were rehabilitated, the floors were renewed, major structural repairs were made, new canopies were installed, the area around the station booth was reconfigured, the platform edge strips were replaced, walls were replaced, and a high-quality public address system was installed. The renovation cost $8.43 million.  Station layout This elevated station has two tracks and one narrow island platform. An arched canopy covers the eastern half (railroad north) of the platform. An artwork called Wheel of Bloom ‚Äì Soak Up the Sun by Jung Hyang Kim was installed in this station during a 2007 renovation. It consists of stained glass panels on the platform's sign structures showing subway train wheels lit by sunlight. Between here and Norwood Avenue, there are the remains of a turn off for the former Chestnut Street incline, which led to the parallel Long Island Rail Road line on Atlantic Avenue. This connection was used primarily for joint service between Williamsburg, Brooklyn and later Lower Manhattan and the beach resorts in Rockaway, Queens.1942 image from Brooklyn Public Library, via Herbert Maruska (NYCSubway.org) A service was also operated to Jamaica, Queens for a time. The joint operation agreement and all through service via the connector was ended after the 1917 summer season. Unused by passenger service since, the ramp was taken down in 1942 for World War II scrap. A tower continued to stand west of the station to control trains using the incline. The tower was taken down sometime after 1970. A sharp S Curve moves the line from Fulton Street to Jamaica Avenue immediately north of the station. The first turn, from Fulton Street onto Crescent Street, ranks as the sharpest curve in the B Division, and second sharpest in the entire New York City Subway, second only to the City hall loop on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. From the late-1950s into the 1960s the New York City Transit Authority had a proposal to realign the BMT Jamaica Line from this station (actually from Grant or Nichols Avenues) northeast to 80th Street and Jamaica Avenue, west of the 85th Street station. This would have also included an express track. The realignment was never carried out. Exits The station's small, single station house is on the extreme eastern end of the platform. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and a single staircase going to an overpass below the tracks that splits into two staircases going down to either side of Fulton Street between Crescent and Pine Streets.

The case garnered national notoriety.  Childhood  Seale's father was a Hillside police officer. He attended A.P. Morris Elementary, and Hillside High School.McQuiston, John T. \\"Details Given On Suspects In Abduction\\", The New York Times, June 21, 1992. Accessed December 12, 2018. \\"After the younger Mr. Seale graduated from Hillside High School in the mid-1960s, he worked briefly as a lifeguard before following his father and joining the Hillside Police Department.\\" Seale graduated from Admiral Farragut Academy in 1965.  Career  In the 1970s, Seale was a police officer for the township. He also worked as Head of Security at Exxon Corporation at the Florham Park, New Jersey ECI - Exxon Company International location in 1982, and was promoted to Security Manager there in 1984. Seale resigned from Exxon a few years later to begin his own furniture business in the Carolinas. After he and his wife, Irene, went broke trying to start their own business in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, they left town owing creditors and moved in with Arthur's parents in Lebanon Township, New Jersey.  Kidnapping and murder of Reso Sidney Reso was kidnapped in the early morning hours of April 29, 1992. Prior to the abduction of Reso, Irene frequently jogged in his neighborhood, in order to monitor his daily routine. She learned that he would usually pull out of his driveway in the morning, getting out of his car to pick up the daily newspaper from his driveway on his way to work. On April 29, Irene jogged past Reso's driveway, and deliberately kicked his paper away, so Reso would be forced to walk a longer distance to pick it up. She then entered Arthur's white van, with him in the passenger seat, and drove to Reso's driveway. As Reso got out of his white 1988 Volkswagen Quantum wagon to retrieve his paper, Arthur got out of his own vehicle, and took Reso in at gunpoint. When Reso saw a wooden box in the back of Arthur's van, he tried to break free. During the ensuing struggle, Reso was shot in the arm, then bound, gagged, and placed in the box, whereupon the kidnappers drove off. An hour later, a neighbor noticed Reso's car still in the driveway with its engine on, and called police. After being unable to find him in the surrounding area, the police concluded that he had been taken for ransom. The next day, police received a phone call from a woman claiming to be Reso's kidnapper, directing them to a letter in a highway street sign. In it, the kidnappers claimed to be members of the Greenpeace Environmentalist group who were furious at Exxon after the Exxon Valdez oil spill three years earlier, as well as the 1985 deliberate Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior that killed Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira. The note demanded $18.5 million in used $100 bills for Reso's release. The money was to be put into several Eddie Bauer laundry bags and dropped outside a restaurant on River Road. Although the FBI had the money ready and waited outside the restaurant for over an hour, the kidnappers never showed up. For the next few weeks, the FBI and investigators received several confusing phone calls and letters leading them to various points throughout Morris and Somerset Counties. One of the calls claimed that the kidnappers were aware of their presence in the ransom deal, and had therefore taken Reso out of the country. However, investigators noticed that the letters were placed in points that only someone with a strong knowledge of Morris Township would have been aware of. They began to suspect that the kidnappers were not members of Greenpeace at all. Another such indication came after the investigators traced the kidnappers' calls; all had been made from nearby pay phones. In response to one of the letters, Reso's wife Patricia made two public appearances on TV, pleading for her husband's safe return. During the investigation, the FBI followed up on several clues, including one eyewitness seeing a white van near Reso's home on the morning of his abduction, a blonde woman seen jogging frequently in the area, and hair belonging to a Golden Retriever found in one of the letters. They would later learn the van belonged to Arthur, the jogger was Irene, and the Seales did indeed own that kind of dog. On the night of June 18, the FBI received another call from the kidnappers for a ransom drop. However, the agents arrived at the drop-off location too late; the chief then received a call from the kidnappers trying to work on an alternative plan. During that call, an agent noticed a man picking up a public phone wearing latex rubber gloves. Suspicious, she took down his license plate number as he drove off. The FBI learned that the car belonged to a nearby rental company. Despite the fact the shop was already closed, the owner agreed to meet up with them, whereupon the FBI learned that the car had been rented to someone named Arthur Seale. Seale arrived in that car soon after, while the agents were still present, and was arrested. Irene was also arrested when she arrived at the shop within minutes.  Imprisonment  Seale pleaded guilty to the kidnapping and murder of Sidney Reso. He is serving a 95-year sentence, in a Federal Prison in Fairton, New Jersey, for kidnapping and murder. He has since earned advanced degrees in psychology, and some degree of praise and recognition for his work with other inmates, as well as for his articles on prison reform and prisoner rehabilitation. After Irene pleaded guilty, she cooperated with police in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. She testified that, after abducting Reso, she and her husband confined him to a pine box in a metal storage facility, giving him very little food and water, and no medical treatment for his bullet wound. Three days after the kidnapping, Reso died from heat and exhaustion. The couple dumped his body in Bass River State Park. It would be discovered on June 28. Irene was sentenced to 20 years in prison; she was released in November 2009.

The other two forts in the system were Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island and Fort DuPont in Delaware City, Delaware. History The original plans for Fort Mott (initially called the \\"Battery at Finn's Point\\") specified eleven gun emplacements for Rodman smoothbore guns and a mortar battery with six emplacements. Construction was started in 1872; however, only two of the gun emplacements and two magazines in the mortar battery were completed by 1876 when all work stopped due to a general suspension of fort work. The Board of Fortifications, often called the Endicott Board, recommended a comprehensive program of new fortifications in 1885. A new Fort Mott was one of the results, and it was completed by 1902 as part of the Harbor Defenses of the Delaware. Unusually for US coast defense forts built 1895-1935, Fort Mott was designed to resist a land attack. A parados (basically an artificial hill) and moat were placed behind the gun batteries to impede an assault from the landward side. Also, the fort's four 5-inch guns were in mounts permitting 360¬∞ of fire, and were sited to fire on attackers flanking the parados. The fort had a typical armament for its day, with a few exceptions. The main armament was Battery Arnold (3 12-inch guns) and Battery Harker (3 10-inch guns). These were on disappearing carriages to allow the guns to normally remain hidden from observation from the river. Flanking these were Battery Gregg, with two 5-inch M1900 guns on M1903 pedestal mounts, and Battery Krayenbuhl, with two 5-inch M1897 guns on balanced pillar mounts, each with all-around fire. Battery Krayenbuhl was sited atop the fort's smallest and most unusual battery, Battery Edwards with two 3-inch mine defense guns in large casemates rebuilt from earlier (1872) magazines. These casemated light guns, intended to protect an underwater minefield in the river by driving off minesweepers, were a unique installation in US forts of this era, in which virtually all emplacements were open-top.Berhow, p. 198 War Department General Order #72, issued on December 16, 1897, designated the new fort as Fort Mott, in honor of Major General Gershom Mott, of Trenton. Gershom Mott had served with distinction as a Second Lieutenant in the 10th Infantry in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, as a Lieutenant-Colonel in the 5th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, and as Colonel and commander of the 6th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry before he was promoted to Brigadier General. He was wounded four times, resigned from the Army in 1866, and died on November 29, 1884. Battery Arnold was named for Brigadier General Lewis G. Arnold, an artillery officer in the Seminole Wars and the Civil War, who died in 1871. Battery Harker was named for Brigadier General Charles G. Harker, killed at Kennesaw Mountain in the Civil War. Battery Gregg was named for Captain John C. Gregg, killed in action during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Battery Krayenbuhl was named for Captain Maurice Krayenbuhl, also killed in action during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Battery Edwards was named for Captain Robert Edwards, killed in the War of 1812. Fort Mott, along with Fort Delaware and Fort DuPont, became obsolete as the principal defensive installations on the Delaware River with the construction of Fort Saulsbury, near Slaughter Beach, Delaware, shortly after World War I. Fort Saulsbury had four guns on long- range barbette carriages and was sited to engage the enemy much further down the estuary than the earlier forts. The Harbor Defenses of the Delaware was one of the most extreme examples of coast defense forts being built further seaward as gun ranges increased.Map of HD Delaware at FortWiki.com In 1910 the two five-inch guns of Battery Gregg were transferred to Fort Ruger, Hawaii,Berhow, p. 220 and in 1918 the similar guns of Battery Krayenbuhl were removed for potential service as field guns on the Western Front. In 1920 the unique Battery Edwards was disarmed as part of a general removal from service of the 3-inch gun M1898. Troops were regularly stationed at Fort Mott from 1897 to 1922. The federal government kept a caretaking detachment at the fort from 1922 to 1943. New Jersey acquired the military reservation as a historic site and State park in 1947. Fort Mott State Park was opened to the public on June 24, 1951. The site is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry, and is located in Pennsville Township, New Jersey. Fort Mott and Finn's Point National Cemetery were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places on August 31, 1978. With The three 10-inch guns of Battery Harker were transferred to Canada in 1941 via Lend-Lease. Two of these remain as of 2014 at Fort Cape Spear, St. John's, Newfoundland. In 1943 Fort Mott was disarmed, losing its remaining three 12-inch guns, the fort being superseded by Fort Miles at Cape Henlopen.Berhow, p. 230 As with most post-Civil War US coastal fortifications outside the Philippines, Fort Mott's guns were fired only for training and testing, never in battle. As of 2018, Fort Mott is connected with Fort Delaware and Delaware City by a seasonal passenger ferry, the Forts Ferry Crossing.Forts Ferry Crossing at VisitNJ.org See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Salem County, New Jersey * Seacoast defense in the United States * United States Army Coast Artillery Corps * Harbor Defense Command * List of coastal fortifications of the United States  References   External links  * Map of HD Delaware at FortWiki.com * American Forts Network, lists forts in the US, former US territories, Canada, and Central America * List of all US coastal forts and batteries at the Coast Defense Study Group, Inc. website * FortWiki, lists most CONUS and Canadian forts * Military History  Fort Mott * Coastal Heritage Trail  Fort Mott * Fort Mott State Park * Gun types at FortWiki State parks of New Jersey National Register of Historic Places in Salem County, New Jersey Mott Mott Parks in Salem County, New Jersey 1872 establishments in New Jersey Protected areas established in 1951 1951 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Fort Mott (New Jersey)"},{"id":"5798138","text":"Kondumal is a census town in Chandrapur district in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

He also played first class cricket for Kent County Cricket Club and was an accomplished athlete.  Biography  Renny-Tailyour was born at Mussoorie, North-Western Provinces (now in Uttarakhand) in what was then British India, while his Scottish father was serving in the army there. He grew up on the family estate at Newmanswalls, Montrose, Angus, and was educated at Cheltenham College before entering the British Army, joining the Royal Engineers.Renny-Tailyour, Colonel Henry Waugh, Obituaries in 1921, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1921.

The Engineers finally won the cup in 1875: 2‚Äì0, after a 1‚Äì1 draw, with Renny-Tailyour scoring in both matches against Old Etonians. This was his last cup final appearance. Renny-Tailyour was selected to represent Scotland on two occasions. First he appeared against England at The Oval in London on 17 November 1871. This match, however, is not regarded as an official international, the Scottish team being entirely composed of London area residents. Renny-Tailyour was selected again in 1873, when England hosted an official international between the two countries for the first time. His residence again proved to be a factor, as the fledgling Scottish Football Association was only able to fund eight players to travel to London. It was therefore necessary to supplement the team with three others based in the south. Renny-Tailyour's goal in Scotland's 4‚Äì2 defeat at The Oval gave him the honour of scoring Scotland's first international goal. His family connections with Montrose led to him being appointed as the local football club's Honorary President, 1887‚Äì88.

It is under Uttarpara police station in Serampore subdivision.District-wise list of statutory towns It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA).  History  It was a small town that grew to be a town in the 19th century. Shib Chandra Deb, the renowned Derozian and Brahmo leader, contributed substantially towards development of Konnagar. A pioneer in women's emancipation, he assisted in the development of schools in the area. The railway station was opened in 1856 and the post office in 1858. In 1931, Tomas Bata, the Czech shoe tycoon, established his first Indian operation at Konnagar. By 1936, the Konnagar plan was phased out. In May 1931, Tomas sold his business interests to his brother Jan Antonin Bata who established Batanagar, Bata's first permanent shoe factory in India. The Bata brand was established on 24 August 1894 in Zl√≠n, Czech Republic. The company first established itself in India in 1931 by renting a building to start an experimental shoe production plant in Konnagar, West Bengal with 75 Czech experts. Though it was under Jan Antonin Bata administration that designed, developed and built the industrial city called Batanagar in 1934. Jan Bata also build factories in Digha near Patna, and elsewhere in India, employing more than 7,000 people. Batanagar, under Jan Bata's ideals became one of the bigger sub-urban towns near Kolkata. The Sens of Konnagar are also very famous for their contribution to the cultural growth in the place. They were the zamindars till late 19th century, but slowly with the British rule coming to an end, the zamindari rules also collapsed. Konnagar has been the home of many notable personalities. It was the ancestral home of the great nationalist and religious leader Sri Aurobindo and noted physicist Sisir Kumar Mitra. Shafiur Rahman one of the martyrs of the language movement in East Pakistan was born in Konnagar. The town had been visited by the greats of Tagore, Mahasweta Devi and many others. Tagore was believed to be just a child when he and his family came to this town to escape the onslaught of Dengue which hit Kolkata. He revisited the town again when he was 19. He came to visit the Brahmasomaj Ghat along with his father Maharshi Debendranath. Shibram Chakraborty used to live here for a brief period of time in his childhood near G.T.Road beside Konnagar High School.Sri Aurobindo's father and famous Indian geographer Shashi Bhusan Chatterjee happened to be a pupil of Konnagar High School established in the 19th century. And the town though got recognition chiefly due to the initiatives of Sib Chandra Deb, its antiquity can hardly be denied. Its reference is there even in the 500-year- old Mangal-KƒÅvya. Konnagar is well known for its Shakuntala Kali Temple. This temple is considered to be very sacred and people from various parts of West Bengal pay a visit. This is a Puja that was started by the Chakraborty Bari Zamindars and today it has become an important event in Konnagar's calendar. The annual Puja is held in the Bengali calendar month of Boisakh (April). A very interesting fact about this Puja is that the idol is completed on the day of Puja itself. There are grand Fairs organised on the grounds adjacent to the temple. The Crowds that Visit Konnagar During Shakuntala Kali Puja Apart from this Puja, there is another important puja in this small city.

A defensive back and kick returner, he played college football at North Carolina State University, and professionally in the American Football League (AFL) for the San Diego Chargers and the Oakland Raiders. Playing career Gibson attended Lee H. Edwards High School in Asheville, North Carolina. Gibson was an instant star on the NC State Wolfpack freshman team, as a defensive back, receiver, return man and halfback. For the next three seasons, Gibson rarely came out of a ballgame. He led the Pack in punt returns in 1958 and 1960, kickoff returns in 1959 and interceptions in 1960 with four. He provided crucial rushing and receiving yards whenever needed. He played his entire senior season with a broken hand and wrist. Gibson concluded his senior year by playing in four post-season all-star games ‚Äî Senior Bowl, Copper Bowl, Coaches All-America Bowl and the Chicago All-Star Game. Gibson, and teammate Roman Gabriel, with four appearances each, played in more postseason all-star games than any Wolfpack player ever. It was Gibson's versatility, speed and daring that made him a valuable pro commodity. He was drafted in the third round of the NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, but elected instead to sign with the American Football League's San Diego Chargers. Gibson played two years for pro football hall of fame coach Sid Gillman at San Diego, leading the league in interceptions in 1962. During Gibson's rookie season, the Chargers lost to the Houston Oilers, 10‚Äì3, in the AFL Championship game. Soon after the championship, Earle Edwards encouraged Gibson to return to NC State to finish his degree work, and help coach spring ball. He received an education degree from State in 1961. Gibson's first year in the pro ranks he picked up a nickname. His Charger teammates gave him the nickname \\"Hoot.\\" \\"During my pro career I never saw my name in the paper as Claude\\", said Gibson. \\"It was 'Hoot' everywhere I went, and still is today.\\" Following the 1962 season, Gibson was traded to the AFL's Oakland Raiders, where his head coach was Al Davis. In both 1963 and 1964, Gibson led the AFL in punt returns, the only player in modern history to do so. In fact, Gibson owns the third best punt return average of all professional football players with 75 or more punt returns. Gibson returned 110 punts for 1,381 yards during his career for a 12.1 average. He scored three punt return touchdowns and had a long return of 85 yards. Gibson's pro career lasted five years, when he abruptly retired at age 27. For the next two years he served as a scout and recruiter in the Raiders' organization. Coaching career In 1967 when Edwards had an opening come up on his staff, Gibson was the first person he called. Gibson returned to Raleigh just in time for what is arguably the greatest football season in NC State history. He coached the \\"white shoed\\" defensive backs of the 1967 Wolfpack, a squad that started the year 8‚Äì0 and rose to #3 in the polls. The 1967 Pack finished the year 9‚Äì2. Following the 1967 season, Gibson began a pro coaching career that lasted two years. At age 29, he coached the Boston Patriots defensive backs in 1968, becoming the youngest assistant coach in professional football. He spent the 1969 season on the Buffalo Bills staff. In 1970, Gibson returned to college football as the offensive coordinator at the University of Tulsa. During July of that year, Gibson was elevated to interim head coach when Golden Hurricane coach Vince Carillot resigned. When Gibson's Tulsa squad started the season 4‚Äì1, which included a stunning upset of Memphis State, a team Tulsa had not beaten in six years, the interim label was removed. His first Golden Hurricane team finished 6‚Äì4. Gibson would spend three seasons at Tulsa, before returning home to the North Carolina mountains. He became the head football coach at Mars Hill College. He spent ten seasons there, compiling a 55‚Äì37‚Äì2 record, winning one South Atlantic Conference championship, producing four Division II All-Americans and 25 All-SAC players. He was recently inducted into the (State of) North Carolina Football Hall of Fame and the Mars Hill University Hall of Fame.

As with many ironmaking terms, this is derived from the French - cinglage. The product of the finery was a bloom or loop (from old Frankish luppa or lopp, meaning a shapeless mass); that of the puddling furnace was a puddled ball. In each case, this needed to be consolidated by hammering into a more regular shape. This was done using a power hammer, worked manually with heavy hammers or later by a waterwheel or steam powered hammers. The result was an oblong shaped iron product similar in appearance to shingles used on roofs. In the finery, this was part of the work of the finer; during puddling, it was done by a special workman called the shingler. The iron (or steel) then had to be further shaped (drawn out) under the hammer or rolled in a rolling mill to produce a bar. In more recent times, the process was carried out using mechanical jaws to squeeze the puddled ball into shape. References * H. R.

Located at the intersection of Norwood Avenue and Fulton Street in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, it is served by the Z train during rush hours in peak direction and the J at all other times.  History  This station was opened on May 30, 1893 as part of the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad's four stop extension of the Lexington Avenue Line to Cypress Hills. From July 18, 2005 to March 13, 2006 this station was closed for rehabilitation. As part of the rehabilitation project, the stairs were rehabilitated, the floors were renewed, major structural repairs were made, new canopies were installed, the area around the station booth was reconfigured, the platform edge strips were replaced, walls were replaced, and a high-quality public address system was installed. The renovation cost $8.40 million. In 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that this station would become ADA- accessible as part of the agency's 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Program.  Station layout This elevated station has two tracks and one island platform. The platform has a short red canopy with green frames and support columns at the east (railroad north) end and silver lampposts and black station sign structures for the rest of the length. The 2007 artwork here is called \\"Culture Swirl\\" by Margaret Lazetta, It consists of stained glass artwork of various images on the platform sign structures. Between here and Crescent Street, the remains of a former connection to the Long Island Rail Road's Atlantic Avenue Branch one block to the south of the BMT Jamaica Line can be seen at Chestnut Street. In the 1890s, the railroad wanted access to Manhattan while the Brooklyn Rapid Transit company wanted access to The Rockaways. Due to the close proximity of the two lines, the companies cooperated on a connection beginning in 1898. The LIRR ran service to Broadway Ferry while BRT ran service to the Rockaways via Woodhaven Junction. When the Williamsburg Bridge opened, LIRR service was extended to Essex Street and later Chambers Street. This was the LIRR's first direct access to Manhattan. In 1917, the United States Railroad Administration ruled that a commuter railroad line cannot operate on the same tracks with a subway or elevated line, requiring this connection to be severed. Most of the junction's structure remained until the 1940s when it was dismantled so the steel could be used in World War II and the Atlantic Avenue Branch was moved underground. Exit The station's only entrance/exit is a station house connected to the platform at the extreme east end. It has a bank of three turnstiles, token booth, and one staircase going down to an elevated passageway beneath the tracks, where two staircases go down to either eastern corners of Norwood Avenue and Fulton Street.

Setting and synopsis The Dread Empire's Fall series is set in a future in which the powerful Shaa species thousands of years ago conquered several other intelligent species, including humanity; imposing on them their inflexible set of laws known as \\"the Praxis\\". When the last living Shaa dies, the species they conquered first, the Naxids, attempts to appoint itself rulers of the former Shaa empire. A civil war erupts when the other species resist them, including the protagonists, Terran (human) naval officers Caroline Sula and Gareth Martinez. Since the Shaa empire stopped expanding long ago and its military was largely occupied by training and suppressing the occasional mutiny or revolt, its strategic and tactical doctrines have become matters of rigid, unchanging tradition. To stop the Naxids, the other species must practice innovation and creativity, something the Shaa attempted to stamp out long ago.

Bicar's journalistic contributions go beyond illustrations to include art criticism and narrative poetry. Being the first Egyptian artist to illustrate Arabic children's books, Bicar has played a major role in establishing and promoting this field. Furthermore, his portraits and oil paintings depicting graceful Egyptian peasants, Nubian scenes, his native Alexandria and Egyptian Pharaonic themes as well as his elegant, gracious nature has earned him great recognition and honors. In the words of late journalist Mustafa Amin:\\"he is not a single artist, he is a master of several arts‚Ä¶he is a painter, photographer, poet, musician and philosopher\\". He was a member of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and was of Turkish Cypriot descent.The others- A court ruling providing official recognition to Bahais has done little to ease the debate on this Israeli-based cult by Gihan Shahine, Al-Ahram Weekly Bicar at young age Birth and early life Hussein Amin Ibrahim Bicar was born on January 2, 1913 near Anfoushi in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, Egypt. From the time of his childhood in Alexandria, Bicar seemed destined to be an artist. He could play the lute at the age of eight and by nine, he was in demand as a music teacher for society ladies who due to cultural restrictions could not use adult male teachers. Bicar's father died when he was young. His mother, who always encouraged his talents, moved him to Cairo when he entered the Higher School of Fine Arts at age fifteen. This school on Khallat Street in Shoubra was founded privately in the early 1900s. All teachers were European and students were obliged to follow a curriculum based in western art. One of his teachers Friedman Cluezel from Sweden was especially important to Bicar's artistic development. He recognized Bicar to be ‚Äúgifted as a portrait artist‚Äù. To express his confidence, Cluezel asked the young student to draw his portrait‚Äîone of the first of many that Bicar produced over the years.\\"Bicar playing the lute\\" by his mentor Ahmed Sabri, 1934 In 1928 the Higher School of Fine Arts was brought under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, and Egyptian artists who had studied in Europe began to be hired as assistants and later as teachers. These teachers brought a new spirit into the school as they promoted sensitivity for Egyptian heritage. Among them was the great sculptor, Mahmoud Mokhtar. In his senior year, Bicar was able to study with the best portrait artist in Egypt at that time, Ahmed Sabri, who became his mentor and lifelong friend. Graduating at the top of his class in 1933, the bright young Bicar had dreams of a brilliant future as a free-lance artist, but the economic depression of the 1930s introduced a harsh reality. Bicar did manage, however, to earn a living during these difficult times and, paradoxically, to develop a versatility that served him well throughout his career.A publication about Hussein Bicar published by the American University in Cairo in 1989, written by Betty Wass El-Wakil The teacher Even from a very early age Bicar taught art to others, in Alexandria when he was just ten years old, he was a music teacher for society ladies who due to cultural restrictions could not use adult male teachers. One of his first jobs was a painter of folkloric scenes in the Helwan wax museum on Ibrahim street. He also found work as a teacher in elementary and secondary schools and, in 1939, was selected as a member of a team of teachers who went to Morocco to teach at the invitation of the Moroccan government. During the next four years in Morocco, he learned to speak Spanish fluently. He also traveled extensively, taking advantage of his proximity to Europe. Bicar was visiting Berlin when World War II was declared. His job in Morocco ended and the Mediterranean was closed to travelers. To return to Egypt, he was forced to go by way of the Cape around South Africa. He spent three months during this journey painting portraits in Mozambique, then a Portuguese colony and the only neutral country on his route. In 1943, after his return to Egypt, he was appointed assistant to his former professor, Ahmed Sabry, Bicar spent the next 17 years there where he went on to become the chair of the painting department where he taught the majority of a generation of contemporary Egyptian artists. His inclination to draw on Egyptian heritage for subject was inspirational for many of these students. The illustrator and story writer Sindbad Children's Magazine, the cover of the first issue dated Jan.3rd 1952 During the years in which he taught at The Faculty of Fine Arts as an assistant to his former professor Ahmed Sabry, his talent for illustrating began to be recognized, He was asked to prepare drawings for the first illustrated book to be published in Egypt, \\"The Stream of Days\\" by the eminent author Taha Hussein. With this book, Bicar discovered a new outlet for his artistic creativity. He began to write himself and to illustrate his writings. His delightful depictions, clear and simple but rich in expression, graced numerous children's books over the years. This labor of love was concentrated ultimately on Sinbad, a children's magazine which Bicar produced and illustrated. Begun in 1952, it was also the first of its kind in Egypt. As an illustrator, Bicar emphasizes that one should not be limited to a single artistic style. The artist should respond to the subject matter and allow it to suggest an appropriate style. Thus, the artist ‚Äúgives himself to the subject.‚Äù Bicar counts among his friends the famous American illustrator, Norman Rockwell, who ‚Äúmade me proud to be an illustrator.‚Äù The traveler, reporter and poet Aside from primarily teaching for 17 years, Bicar also did some illustration work for the newspaper, Akhbar El Yom. In 1959, its founders and owners, Aly and Mustafa Amin, asked him to work full-time. He was to fill a unique position, that of a foreign correspondent who produced illustrated reportage for world circulation. He left the Faculty of Arts and began this adventurous assignment which took him to Ethiopia, Syria, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Spain. These travels were curtailed when the newspaper was nationalized in 1962. That position was terminated but Bicar continued to write regular column as an art critic for Akhbar El Yom and also write and illustrate a series of four ‚Äìline verses called ‚ÄúThe Rubaiyat‚Äù. The artist \\"Triumph\\" by Bicar Hussein Bicar believes that the challenge to artists today is to syncretize by being local and international at the same time. He feels that a successful artist acknowledges the interdependence of all societies and cultures yet does not ignore the cultural foundation which gives fundamental meaning to life. Bicar believes that modern art has lost its way by resorting to shape without content. His art has a message. He aspires not ‚Äúto imitate trite shapes‚Äù but to find the spirit that can inspire the artist. He defers to Mahmoud Mokhtar who was the first to insist that modern Egyptian art must come from Egyptian roots but should not imitate traditional art. As a painter, Bicar's work is characterized by pure and simple lines which convey elements of forcefulness and spirituality. His versatility appears again and again as he works in a variety of media including water color, tempera, and oils‚Äîbut the result is a distinctive Bicar style. His subject matter is Egyptian. Unlike classical Greek or Roman art, which may be described as basically physical, the essence of Egyptian art is spiritual. The stylized figures in his paintings carry a poetic message representing the stability, nobility, and strength to be found in the character of Egypt's agrarian roots. His sparse, minimalistic lines often impose a sculptured quality on his figures in their austere settings. This philosophical orientation towards expressing the spirituality of subjects is also apparent in Bicar's portraits. His subjects seem to glow and exude their personalities. Since his college days, Bicar has continued to be an outstanding portrait artist. A gentle, modest, and extremely gifted man, Hussein Bicar's contribution to the arts of Egypt is beyond measure. After more than half a century as an artist and critic, he continued to be eclectic in his tastes, receptive to change, and eager to understand all schools of art as they reflect world conditions. Elegant in his simplicity, Bicar explained, ‚ÄúTo understand is to appreciate‚Äù. Abu Simbel Salvage and \\"The Eighth Wonder\\" Film The Eighth Wonder 1 Amongst the most magnificent works of Bicar is the set of paintings done by Bicar for \\"The Eighth Wonder\\", a documentary narrating the tale of Ramses II Temple in Abu Simbel in southern Egypt. While the construction of The Aswan Dam, begun in 1960, to stabilize the water supply of Egypt, the flooding which would result threatened the existence of irreplaceable ancient temples. Such temples are a unique legacy, not only to Egypt but to humanity as a whole. Thus, many countries came forward to participate in the rescue of these monuments under the umbrella of the UNESCO. In a remarkable feat of the 20th-century technology, Abu Simbel, one of the most valuable of Egypt's monuments, was moved to a higher location. The Eighth Wonder 2 During the transfer of Abu Simbel, the idea developed of making a movie to document the history of the temple from its construction to the present, the movie called ‚ÄúThe Eighth Wonder‚Äù was a product of efforts of former Minister of Culture Dr.Sarwat Okasha. Dr. Okasha asked John Feeney from Canada to direct this production. Dr. Shehata Adam prepared the historical material. The film was produced under the supervision of the Director of the Center for Documentary Film, Hassan Fouad. Bicar was asked to depict in paintings the early stages of constructing the temple. This included the opening ceremony for Abu Simbel‚Äîa ceremony attended by Ramses II and his lovely wife, Nefertari‚Äî‚Äúthe prettiest of the pretty.‚Äù Ramses II had built several temples including one for Nefertari constructed next to one of his own. Bicar drew illustrations depending on historical and geometrical information provided on this grand architectural structure. It took him more than two years to complete those works during which he visited Nubia and Thebes, Egypt. Bicar's paintings commissioned for the film, demonstrate mastery of his art and craft. Like the ancient Egyptian architecture, Bicar shows brilliance and precision. It is a great work of creativity. By drawing on imagination and consulting books of history, he has breathed life back into a full era of ancient history. The commentary of the film was in English and Arabic and was produced in cinema laboratories in Rome for showing in movie theaters in Egypt and in Egyptian cultural centers abroad. It was shown in the Berlin festival for documentary films in 1973. A copy of the film was dedicated by director John Feeney to The New Zealand Film Archive. Visitors of Kafr El Gouna, near the red sea city town of Hurghada can now visit the Abu Simbel Museum by Bicar. On display are 54 of the paintings he created for the documentary, which showcase his consummate skill in historical illustrations and his passion for the Pharaonic civilization. The musician Bicar with his lute and bouzouki Bicar playing bouzouki Bicar was an avid music lover, he could play the lute at the age of eight and by nine was teaching it to young girls and woman society .Oddly enough, he never learned how to read notations even with the help of tutor and claimed unfortunately, I did not go beyond the ear, I listen to music but I could never read the note. Bicar was a major figure in the art of scene of Cairo for more than 50 years. As a musician, poet, painter, teacher, illustrator, reporter and storywriter, Bicar has given and continues to give great pleasure to millions of people. His contribution to the arts is beyond measure. Elegantly simplistic, eclectic and receptive to change, Bicar explains that \\"to understand is to appreciate\\" the fine lines of his cartoons stirred countless imaginations while the vibrant colors of his magnificent paintings gave voice to a million unuttered words. Bah√° º√≠ life In the 1980s, the Egyptian government arrested a number of Bah√° º√≠s, including Bicar, who was one of the high-profile leaders of the community. The Bah√° º√≠s were accused of trying to share teachings of the religion, which was banned in Egypt in the 1960s. Labib Moawad, one of Egypt's leading lawyers, defended Bicar and the other Bah√° º√≠s, and eventually all charges against Bicar were dropped due to his old age. Bicar presented Moawad with a painting as a tribute for his efforts during the trial. After the trial, Bicar received the Mubarak award for the arts, and his public status was rehabilitated. Awards Over the years, Bicar received a number of awards and decorations, among them are the following: * Medal of pride from government of Morocco, 1942 * Patent of appreciation from Minister of Culture in Syria, 1961 * First class Medal of Science and art, 1967 * Honorary Award of Biennale of Alexandria, 1970 * Certificate of Honor from Art Academy, 1972 * Gamal Abdel Nasser Award with participation of the Soviet Union, 1975 * The State Merit Award in 1978 * National Certificate of Appreciation and Medal of Honor, 1980 * And most recently, the Mubarak prize (Egypt 2000) shortly before his death Tribute On January 2, 2017, Google Doodle commemorated Hussein Amin Bicar's 104th birthday.

Other sports include Volleyball and Badminton, such as the JVC Badminton tournament and the first-ever Manny V. Pangilinan Badminton Tournament, pitting players from Asia and Europe, in 2005. The network also launched Solar Sports Desk, a late-evening sports news program, similar to ESPN, those famed American sports programs such as SportsCenter. On October 2006, Solar Sports re-launch its channel, adding local shows. The channel is available exclusively in Metro Manila through Global Destiny Cable as of 2008. It used to be available exclusively on Sky Cable, but the two parties ceased their partnership at end of 2007 but it will be back on July 1. All cable companies in the provinces can put the channel without having to worry about exclusive rights. On April 10, 2017 Sky Cable & Destiny Cable dropped Solar Sports along with sister channels Basketball TV (now defunct), CT (now defunct), Jack TV & NBA Premium TV (now defunct) allegedly due to Sky Cable's unpaid carriage fees. On January 1, 2019 the channel was restored on Sky Cable after 1 year of carriage disputes. On October 1, 2019, Basketball TV ceased airing after 13 years, which means all remaining basketball-related programs will now air on Solar Sports. Among those basketball-related programs include NBL Philippines, Liga Endesa, FIBA World Basketball and Universities and Colleges Basketball League among others.

The building features a dramatic medieval castle style known as Rundbogenstil, or \\"rounded arch\\" around the windows and doors. There is also a Norman style influence in the castle-like parapets. The exterior walls are limestone rubble smoothed over with stucco and scored to simulate cut stone blocks. The building is located on the southeast corner of the Texas State Capitol grounds. One employee, William Sidney Porter - pen name O. Henry Porter - worked in the office from 1887 to 1891, and would later attain fame as a writer. Some of his works would include those set at the building, such as \\"Bexar Script No. 2692\\" and \\"Georgia's Ruling\\". The building functioned as the state's land office building until 1917 (60 years) when the agency moved to a larger building across the street. From 1919 until 1988 (70 years) the building housed the Texas Confederate Museum, run by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and United Daughters of the Confederacy. The building was modified during the mid-20th century but was vacated, then restored between 1989 and 1992. The project returned the building's interior and exterior to resemble its late 19th-century appearance. The Texas Confederate Museum was not allowed to return. Today, it serves as the Capitol Visitors Center, offering exhibits and tours about the Texas State Capitol. There is also a Texas Department of Transportation Travel Center that offers free maps and literature on travel destinations throughout the state.

Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003. (pg. 64) Biography Miyake started his training under Fusen-ryu jujutsu master Mataemon Tanabe, as well as Osaka master Yataro Handa. In 1899 he started working as a teacher in Nara, and two years later he was appointed police instructor in Kobe. However, in 1904 he was fired for taking part in a brawl, so Miyake departed Japan for London.Racine Journal-News, March 6, 1915 Miyake toured through spectacles and music halls, and he famously defeated the reigning champion in the jujutsu style, Yukio Tani. Miyake and Tani then joined forces, opening a jujutsu school and co-authoring a book titled \\"The Game of Ju-Jitsu\\". In London, he sat for the well-known English artist and lithographer Albert de Belleroche. Beginning in 1908, Miyake toured Europe along countrymen Sadakazu Uyenishi and Mitsuyo Maeda, and he once launched a challenge to famous Great Gama. In 1914, he reached United States and stayed there for 20 years, settling down in Seattle, where he set his school. On October 20, 1917, Miyake had a famous challenge match against professional wrestler and catch wrestling practitioner Ad Santel. Miyake fought bravely, but he lost the match after receiving a half Nelson slam so contundent that Miyake remained dizzy for half an hour after the bout.John Stevens, The Way of Judo: A Portrait of Jigoro Kano and his Students Now interested in professional wrestling, Miyake started working at Ed \\"The Strangler\\" Lewis's wrestling promotion, learning the art and having matches against names like Toots Mondt, Clarence Eklund and some others. In 1928 Miyake returned to Japan and toured there with three other wrestlers, but professional wrestling was not popular in Japan back then and the shows did not sell tickets. He returned to United States along with Danzan-ryu trainee Oki Shikina, who became his apprentice. As of 1932, in his 50s, he was still competing in bouts at Madison Square Garden. He died in 1935.

They play in the NCL Division Three and have a thriving junior section. Their second team, known as the Shamrocks, competed in the Pennine League in 2005/2006 but had to withdraw after British Amateur Rugby League Association rule changes meant that players could not overlap summer and winter seasons. History Dewsbury Celtic is one of the oldest Irish sports clubs in Yorkshire and possibly Britain. The origins of Dewsbury Celtic can be directly linked to Ireland‚Äôs Great Famine of 1845. Official records show that in 1845 200 Irish immigrants were living in Daw Green, Westtown. By 1851 the number had risen to 1,000 working mainly as labourers and mill workers. Having started as Dewsbury Shamrocks in 1879 they switched in the late 1890s to football, returning to rugby league in 1910. At this point they joined what was then the Northern Union and changed their name to Dewsbury Celtic. They became one of the best local teams and won the Yorkshire County Amateur Cup in 1912-13. This team was torn apart by the First World War, losing 15 players. They reformed in 1919 and then disbanded again in 1939 at the start of the Second World War. In the post-war period the club reformed and became one of the most famous names in amateur rugby league, and their name was feared by professional clubs drawn against them in the Rugby League Challenge Cup. Celtic continued to win trophies on a regular basis, these included the Yorkshire Cup, Leeds League titles and George Oldroyd Trophy 13 times between 1953 and 1969. In recent times other local teams have overtaken Celtic in the league structure and in an effort to revitalise the club they switched to summer rugby in 2005, taking over the fixtures of the defunct Manchester Knights in the Central Premier. In 2006 they applied for National League Three, finishing in 5th place and qualifying for the play-offs, where they lost to St Albans Centurions. In 2007 National League Three was rebranded as the Rugby League Conference National Division and Celtic were one of six Yorkshire teams in the ten team league. They achieved their highest place to- date with a very good 4th place. They also competed in the Northern Rail Cup, finishing behind Bramley Buffaloes, who qualified for the knock-out stages. In 2019 Dewsbury Celtic competed in the Kingstone Press NCL (Division Three) competing against teams from all over the country. Brendan Sheridan and Mark Brierley coached them to win promotion in an outstanding play off final win over Heworth ARLFC gaining promotion to the NCL Division 2. Shortly after this, Celtic toured Australia in November 2019 returning back to England with one win under their belt down under. They beat Penshurst RSL 4 - 10 but fell short in their second battle to De La Salle losing 34 - 10. Soon after a successful season, Head coach Brendan Sheridan is appointed assistant coach at Oldham RLFC in the Betfred Championship. Now in 2020, Paul Heaton, Mark Brierley and Dom Byrne take on the challenge of keeping Celtic up in the second division.

In 1214 he fought alongside King Philip Augustus at the Battle of Bouvines. Marriages and Children His first marriage with Mahaut of Burgundy (1150-1192) in 1178 ended with separation in 1181 and produced no children. The excuse for the annulment was consanguinity. Mahaut and Robert were both great-great grandchildren of William I, Count of Burgundy and his wife Etiennete and they were both Capetian descendants of Robert II of France.

Accessed Mar. 17, 2009. Fictional character biography At the age of 10, the child who would grow up to become The Shroud saw his parents gunned down right before his eyes. He decided to dedicate his life to fighting crime. Upon graduation from college, he joined the mysterious temple called the \\"Cult of Kali\\", where he studied various styles of martial arts. After seven years of intense training, he graduated from that temple. During the celebration ceremony, he was branded with the \\"Kiss of Kali\\", a red-hot iron. He had the image of the goddess Kali imprinted in livid scar tissue on his face from nose to hairline and from cheek to cheek. Following a period of intense pain and hospitalization, he realized that his eyesight had been replaced by a mystic extrasensory perception. Traveling back to the United States, he adopted the masked identity of the \\"Shroud\\".origin revealed in Super-Villain Team-Up #7 In his first appearance as a hero, he encountered the Human Torch.Super-Villain Team-Up #5 He later invaded Latveria, intending to kill Doctor Doom for his crimes against humanity. Shroud recounted his origin to Namor the Sub-Mariner, and the two secretly entered Latveria disguised as members of the Ringmaster's Circus of Crime. Shroud joined Prince Rudolfo's revolution against Doctor Doom, and came close to his revenge.Super-Villain Team-Up #6-10 However, the Shroud shifted gears in order to help Doctor Doom and Captain America oppose someone else with a longer track record of crimes against humanity: the Red Skull. In outer space, Shroud was shot by a ray built by Red Skull while Doctor Doom battled Red Skull on the moon. Shroud was rescued by Captain America, while Red Skull was left defeated on the moon (he was later rescued by Hitler himself as the Hate Monger). Captain America brought Shroud back to Earth, but because of his time in space, Shroud became insane and it took him quite a while to recover.Super-Villain Team-Up #11-12 After this recovery, Shroud discovered that he was able to tap into the Darkforce dimension. The Shroud later recruits Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew) to infiltrate a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility so that they can access the files. Alongside Spider-Woman, the Shroud battled the Cult of Kali.Spider-Woman #13-15 Shroud then took on Cat and Mouse as his aides.Marvel Preview #21 He then teamed with Spider-Man against Dansen Macabre.Marvel Team-Up #94 The Shroud aided the Avengers and Doctor Strange against Morgan le Fay.

This led him to create the group known as the Night Shift.Captain America #330 With the Night Shift, he teamed with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates.Captain America #330-331 He tested Moon Knight to see if he could take over as leader of the Night Shift.Solo Avengers #3 He refused Taurus's offer to join the new Zodiac.West Coast Avengers Vol. 2 #29 He teamed with Hawkeye against the gang leader, Speedo.Solo Avengers #9 Behind the scenes, Shroud made a deal with the West Coast Avengers not to interfere with his activities underground, but during a battle, Shroud went missing and the Night Shift battled the Avengers, causing a strain between the groups when the Shroud stopped the battle.West Coast Avengers Vol. 2 #40 When Shroud returned to action, it was revealed that he had spent some time with his family, though no actual names of that family have ever been revealed. Shroud made few appearances in the years following. When the Superhero Registration Act was proposed by the United States during the Civil War storyline, Shroud refused to accept the proposal to give up his secret identity, and sided against heroes such as Ms. Marvel and Iron Man. He is also in a romantic relationship with Julia Carpenter (now known as Arachne). With Julia's help, Shroud managed to escape from Ryker's Island, injuring a number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the process. The two of them planned to flee to Canada with Rachel (Julia's daughter), but Wonder Man and Ms. Marvel captured Shroud,Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #7 (Marvel Comics, Nov. 2006). and Julia the following issue. He is then broken out,Civil War #6 (Marvel Comics, Dec. 2006). in order to join Captain America's anti-registration army and takes part in the final battle.Civil War #7 (Marvel Comics, Jan. 2007). During the Shadowland storyline, Shroud is paired with Silver Sable, Misty Knight, and Paladin when Daredevil's Hand ninjas target members of the mafia.Shadowland - Blood on the Streets #1 Powers and abilities Exposure to bombardment of the Red Skull's hypno-ray triggered a latent power over darkness in the Shroud. Shroud possesses the mystical ability to create an aperture into Darkforce Dimension and to project the thick, inky gas-like substance of the Darkforce Dimension into Earth's dimension for his own use. This darkness is not simply the absence of light, but the negation of it. No illumination can penetrate it. It is unknown how much of this darkness Shroud can summon at once. He can blanket a small auditorium in darkness within several seconds. The darkness he projects does not fill a volume instantly: it is possible to see its hazy boundary move like thick, black smoke in the air. There appears to be no limit to the length of time Shroud can maintain the darkness. However, loss of concentration can disrupt his power to summon and control darkness, and if Shroud is rendered unconscious the darkness seems to be naturally drawn through the portal from which it came. The Shroud has control over the darkness so as to create hazy-edged, featureless black shapes with it, the complexity of which is limited only by his imagination. For example, he once created two discs that covered Captain America's eyes, preventing him from seeing anything or becoming hypnotized, yet so small that they were indistinguishable from the pupils of his eyes. He frequently forms the darkness into his own shadow in order to serve as a decoy. Unlike Darkstar's Darkforce, the darkness possesses no mass, and unlike Cloak, Shroud is unable to travel into and out of the dimension from which he draws his darkness. He eventually learned to give his darkness enough mass to serve as a low-level thruster. Together, with the properties of his cape, this allows him to fly at least at walking speed. The Shroud was blinded in a mystic ceremony by the Cult of Kali. As a result of this ceremony, he possesses a mystical sense of extrasensory perception enabling him to \\"see\\" through walls and even through his own mantle of darkness. This mystical sense gives him psychic impressions of his environment within a radius of about . Not unlike Daredevil, Shroud can receive non-visual sensory impressions through solid objects. Thus, he can perceive people and objects in the room next to him with the ease that he can perceive the contents of the room he is in. His mystic senses can even enable him to detect the internal hardware components of a computer.Spider-Woman #15 The Shroud is an Olympic-level athlete with extensive training in several fields of Oriental martial arts, and is adept at acrobatics and infiltration.

Intuitively, the inner measure of a set is a lower bound of the size of that set.  Definition  An inner measure is a function :\\\\varphi: 2^X \\\\rightarrow [0, \\\\infty], defined on all subsets of a set X, that satisfies the following conditions: *Null empty set: The empty set has zero inner measure (see also: measure zero). :: \\\\varphi(\\\\varnothing) = 0 * Superadditive: For any disjoint sets A and B, :: \\\\varphi( A \\\\cup B) \\\\geq \\\\varphi(A) + \\\\varphi( B ). * Limits of decreasing towers: For any sequence {Aj} of sets such that A_j \\\\supseteq A_{j+1} for each j and \\\\varphi(A_1) < \\\\infty :: \\\\varphi \\\\left(\\\\bigcap_{j=1}^\\\\infty A_j\\\\right) = \\\\lim_{j \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\varphi(A_j) * Infinity must be approached: If \\\\varphi(A) = \\\\infty for a set A then for every positive real number c, there exists B ‚äÜ A such that, :: c \\\\leq \\\\varphi( B) <\\\\infty  The inner measure induced by a measure  Let Œ£ be a œÉ-algebra over a set X and Œº be a measure on Œ£.

Essentially Œº* gives a lower bound of the size of any set by ensuring it is at least as big as the Œº-measure of any of its Œ£-measurable subsets. Even though the set function Œº* is usually not a measure, Œº* shares the following properties with measures: :# Œº*(‚àÖ) = 0, :# Œº* is non-negative, :# If E ‚äÜ F then Œº*(E) ‚â§ Œº*(F).  Measure completion  Induced inner measures are often used in combination with outer measures to extend a measure to a larger œÉ-algebra. If Œº is a finite measure defined on a œÉ-algebra Œ£ over X and Œº* and Œº* are corresponding induced outer and inner measures, then the sets T ‚àà 2X such that Œº*(T) = Œº* (T) form a œÉ-algebra \\\\hat \\\\Sigma with \\\\Sigma\\\\subseteq\\\\hat\\\\Sigma.Halmos 1950, ¬ß 14, Theorem F The set function ŒºÃÇ defined by :\\\\hat\\\\mu(T)=\\\\mu^*(T)=\\\\mu_*(T) for all T \\\\in \\\\hat \\\\Sigma is a measure on \\\\hat \\\\Sigma known as the completion of Œº.

One of the first streams of Romanesque architecture in Europe from the 10th century and the beginning of 11th century is called First Romanesque or Lombard Romanesque. It took place in the region of Lombardy (at that time the term encompassing the whole of Northern Italy) and spread into Catalonia and into the south of France. Its principal decoration for the exterior, bands of ornamental blind arches are called Lombard bands. It was characterized by thick walls and lack of sculpture in facades, and with interiors profusely painted with frescoes. During the first quarter of the 11th century, much architectural activity by groups composed of Lombard teachers and stonemasons (Comacine Guild), who worked throughout much of Europe and Catalan territories and erected fairly uniform temples, some of which still exist today.The Monastery of Santa Maria de Roses of 1022 is the oldest of the Lombard features in Catalonia. For a considerable area this process of craft diffusion started in Lombardy and Lombardus became the word for mason at an early period. One might call the First Romanesque style the style of this Italian architectural reconquest. The large promoter and sponsor of this art in Catalonia was Oliva, monk and abbot of the monastery of Ripoll who, in 1032, ordered the extension of the body of this building with a fa√ßade with two towers, plus a transept which included seven apses, all decorated on the outside with the Lombardic ornamentation of blind arches and vertical strips. Catalan architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch suggested that what was formerly considered the late form of pre-Romanesque architecture in Catalonia bore features of Romanesque and thus classified it as First Romanesque (primer rom√†nic). The First Romanesque churches of the Vall de Bo√≠ were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in November 2000. The geographical proximity of this Iberian region to the rest of Europe, resulted in depictions of the emerging Romanesque art being brought to Catalonia. While the art failed to take root in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula until the second third of the 11th century, there are numerous examples of its presence in Catalan counties before this time. Though this style may not be considered fully Romanesque, the area contained many of the defining characteristics of this artistic style. To avoid the term Pre-Romanesque, which is often used with a much broader meaning than is generally suited to refer to early Medieval and early Christian art, and in Spain may also refer to the Visigothic, Asturias, Mozarabic and Repoblaci√≥n art forms, Puig i Cadafalch preferred to use the term \\"First Romanesque\\" or \\"first Romanesque art\\" to designate those Catalan anticipations of the Romanesque itself.

Located at the intersection of Alabama Avenue and Fulton Street in East New York, Brooklyn, it is served by the J train at all times and the Z train during rush hours in the peak direction.  History  On September 5, 1885, the Brooklyn Elevated Railway was extended to Alabama Avenue, with 1,500 passengers using the station during the morning of its first day of service. In 1985, the station had only 321 paying daily riders on a typical weekday not counting farebeaters, making it one of the least used stations in the system. The station was closed for renovations from January 13 to December 14, 2005. As part of the station renovation project, the stairs were rehabilitated, the floors were renewed, major structural repairs were made, new canopies were installed, the area around the station booth was reconfigured, the platform edge strips were replaced, walls were replaced, and a high-quality public address system was installed. The renovation cost $8.89 million. Prior to May 2014, Alabama Avenue was a skip-stop station where only J trains stopped during weekday rush hours in the peak direction. By May 2014, all J and Z trains began stopping at this station.  Station layout This elevated station has one island platform and two tracks. The platform has a red canopy with green frames and support columns at the west (railroad south) end. A trackway starts at the top of the station's flat canopy and runs to the elevated complex at Broadway Junction. This track was intended to be an express track, with work beginning on the proposed express track in the late 1960s. However, engineering studies completed after the work started indicated that the vibration of trains passing over the stations would be too severe and would literally shake the stations apart. A nameless artwork by Scott Redden was installed here in 2008. It consists of three stained glass panels in eight of the nine station sign structures on the platform. The panels depict scenes related to farming including a farmhouse, chicken, and pick-up truck. The street area under the station was depicted in a painting created by artist Rackstraw Downes, titled \\"Under the J Line at Alabama Avenue, 2007.\\" Exits The station's only entrance/exit is an elevated station house beneath the tracks. It has one staircase to the platform at the south end, turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases facing in opposite directions going down to the southeast corner of Alabama Avenue and Fulton Street.

Origins FMP originated from the New Artists Guild, which was an informal cooperative of musicians in the mid-1960s. In 1968, The New Artists Guild sponsored the Total Music Meeting, a festival that presented different forms of music from those performed at the Berliner Jazztage. The name FMP was adopted the following year and the group \\"began operating as a cooperative venture under the administrative guidance of a former double bass player, Jost Gebers [...] At some point the operation of FMP transferred from the cooperative to Gebers alone.\\" Company activities The label's first release was Manfred Schoof's European Echoes. Specialising in free jazz from the beginning, FMP soon released recordings by saxophonist Peter Br√∂tzmann, pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach, bassist Peter Kowald and drummer Detlef Schonenberg. The collective ended in 1976 and Gebers, who was running the company part-time, decided to found a sub-label, SAJ, with drummer Sven-Ake Johansson. This concentrated on experimental and avant-garde music, releasing recordings by musicians such as Hugh Davies, Heiner Goebbels-Alfred Harth and Yoshi Wada. In the late 1980s, SAJ was discontinued and CD releases were numbered from CD 1. A lot of FMP's releases have been recordings of concert performances, including those that it organised. In 1988 FMP recorded Cecil Taylor in Berlin '88, an 11-CD, award-winning collection. According to Grove, \\"Vinyl stock was deleted in 1992\\". In 2000 FMP-Publishing became the new owner of FMP, but a legal battle ensued between Gebers and the new group. In 2007, he returned to being in charge of the label.

It is connected to Faridabad and south-east Delhi by the Delhi Metro. Ballabhgarh is the fourth city in Haryana to get metro connectivity after Gurgaon, Faridabad and Bahadurgarh.

Ballabhgarh jagir abolished and came under direct British rule. Nahar's adopted son and nephew, Kushal Singh, left Ballabhgarh and later became inheritor of jagir of his wife at Kuchesar. The founder: Gopal Singh  Gopal Singh, a Tewatia Jat, the founder of the princely state of Ballabgarh, migrated from Alwalpur village in 1705, and established himself at Sihi ( from Ballabhgarh) after displacing Taga Brahman farmers there. Gopal Singh Tewatia of Sihi started establishing his power in Delhi, Khair and Mathura areas. He attacked Rajput of that area with the help of people of Lagon village. He became more powerful and richer and started to waylay the mughal travelers on Delhi-Agra royal route during the reign of Aurangzeb (d. 1707). In 1710, during the reign of Aurangzeb's son Bahadur Shah I, the Mughal officer Murtaza Khan of Faridabad signed a treaty with Goapl Singh confirming Gopal as Chaudhary of Faridabad pargana. He wanted to expand his army and collect huge wealth but soon died in 1711. Gopal's successor was his son Charan Das Tewatia, who was also ambitious. When Charan Das saw weakening of the Mughal rule, he stopped paying malgujari (octroi) to Mughals. As a result, Mughals arrested and imprisoned Charan Das at Faridabad fort for a short time in 1714 during the reign of Farrukhsiyar (r. 1713-1719). His son Balram Singh freed him by pretending to pay the ransom.Charan Das's son, Balram Singh, later rose to be a powerful king. Expansion: Balram Singh (Ballu Jat)  In 1720 farmers rose in revolt under the leadership of Balram Singh (Ballu Jat) when during the reign of Muhammad Shah (r. 1719-1748), Mughal officer of Faridabad Murtaza Khan started to impose heavy taxes while famine was raging. Murtaza Khan had in the past also imprisoned Balram's father. Balram killed Murtaza Khan at Faridabad and shut the Mughal traffic on Delhi-Agra route. In 1739, Mughal king bestowed on him titles of \\"Rao\\" and \\"Naib Bakshi\\". He built the Nahar Singh fort and founded the city of Ballabhgarh is named after him.Jats along the Delhi-Agra route at that time were in revolt against the oppressive Mughal rule. Tewatias of this area had already established themselves as counter force in this area. Balram Jat held the surrounding country as a feudatory of Suraj Mal of Bharatpur (r. 1755 ‚Äì 1763). He was the brother-in-law of Maharaja Suraj Mal and mama of Jawahar Singh. Balram Singh often called Ballu by the local people moved on a few Elephants, Horses and Camels loaded with Big drums (Nagaade) and Dhaunse (big band) followed by his local army. Went wherever Ballu with this band, it was assumed that area was no longer of Mughals and Ballu had won that. It was a kind of Aswamedh Yagna that he performed. Here from started a saying \\"Dheeng Dheeng Ballu ka Raj\\". Immediately peace returned to those areas, which were won over by Ballu. On 11 January 1750, Jat sangh of Balram Singh of Ballabhgarh, Suraj Mal of Bharatpur and Bhim Singh Rana of Gohad waged a battle against Mughal forces of Safdar Jang (b.1708 - d.1754) of Oudh and Mir Salawat Khan during the reign of Mughal emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur (r. 1748- 1754), which Jats won and mughals had to conceded a lot concessions. On 30 June 1750, Safdar Jung, marched against Balram but Balram managed to evade him using stratagem with the help of Marathas.Mughal king Ahmad Shah Bahadur replaced Safdar Jung with Gaziuddin Khan (\\"Intizam-Ud-Daullahas\\" or \\"lmad-ul- Mulk\\", the imperial Mir Bakhshi) as new wizir. Safdar Jung, supported by Balram Jat and Surajmal Jat, revolted against the Mughal king. Murtija Khan's son Aqaibet Mahmud Khan was the chief diwan of Gaziuddin Khan, he and Balram agreed to meet to negotiate the terms of truce. Balram arrived with his son, diwan and 250 men, angry words flew, Balram put his hand on his sword, Aquibat's guard suddenly fell upon Balram and killed him, his son, diwan and 9 other escorts.

A characteristic feature of rat-tailed maggots is a tube-like, telescoping breathing siphon located at its posterior end. This acts like a snorkel, allowing the larva to breathe air while submerged. The siphon is usually about as long as the maggot's body ( when mature), but can be extended as long as . This organ gives the larva its common name. The most commonly encountered rat- tailed maggot is the larva of the drone fly, Eristalis tenax. It lives in stagnant, oxygen-deprived water, with a high organic content. It is fairly tolerant of pollution and can live in sewage lagoons and cesspools. In 2017, rat-tailed maggots gained some press coverage after they were recognised in the composting toilets of the Glastonbury Festival. Commercial use These larvae, commonly called \\"mousies\\", are cultured and sold as fish bait. They are especially popular in ice fishing.Dictionary of Ichthyology; Brian W. Coad and Don E. McAllister at ww.briancoad.com Infection Occasionally, cases have been documented of human intestinal myiasis caused by the rat-tailed maggot. Symptoms can range from none (asymptomatic) to abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, or pruritus ani. Infection can be caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water, but doubts have been expressed that accidentally ingested fly larvae could survive in the gastrointestinal tract. Zumpt proposed an alternative called \\"rectal myiasis\\". Flies, attracted to feces, may deposit their eggs or larvae near or into the anus, and the larvae then penetrate further into the rectum.

This revision of the renal pelvis treats the obstruction by excising the stenotic area of the renal pelvis or uretero- pelvic junction and creating a more capacious conduit using the tissue of the remaining ureter and renal pelvis. There are different types of pyeloplasty depending on the surgical technique and patterns of incision used. These include the Y-V, Inverted 'U', and Dismembered types of pyeloplasty. The dismembered type of pyeloplasty (called an Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty) is the most common type of pyeloplasty. This was described in relation to retrocaval ureter (now renamed as preureteric vena cava). Another technique of pyeloplasty is Culp's pyeloplasty; in this method a flap is rotated from dilated pelvis to decrease narrowing of ureter.

The FAA imposed the rule in 1981, after reviewing a series of accidents that were caused by flight crews who were distracted from their flying duties by engaging in non-essential conversations and activities during critical parts of the flight. One such accident was Eastern Air Lines Flight 212, which crashed just short of the runway at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport in 1974 while conducting an instrument approach in dense fog. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that a probable cause of the accident was lack of altitude awareness due to distraction from idle chatter among the flight crew during the approach phase of the flight. Historical background In the early days of aviation, pilots had little chance to contemplate non-essential activities. Flying demanded constant attention, and the wind and engine noise in a slipstream-blasted open cockpit all but drowned out normal conversations. In the early years of instrument flying, the effort involved in \\"flying the beam\\" (navigating a course determined by the intersection of ground-based radio signals by straining to listen through a headset to a scratchy audio stream of \\"dits and dahs\\") also forced pilots to concentrate on flying duties during instrument meteorological conditions. As aviation technology matured into the Jet Age in the 1960s, comfort and sound levels gradually became more office-like and hence more conducive to distractions. Multi-person flight and cabin crews, autopilots, in-flight meals, newspaper service and other comforts further increased the availability and convenience of non-flight related activities for flight crews during flight time. The introduction of the Cockpit Voice Recorder as an objective onboard observer played an important role in the assessment of the problem during accident investigation by the NTSB, and eventual implementation of the rules by the FAA. Operating requirements According to the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), the rule is legally applicable only to Part 121 (Scheduled Air Carriers) and Part 135 (Commercial Operators), and not to Part 91 (non-commercial general aviation). It is specified in U.S. FAR 121.542/135.100, \\"Flight Crewmember Duties\\": ::Note: Taxi is defined as \\"movement of an airplane under its own power on the surface of an airport\\". Flight attendant and pilot communication Because the Sterile Cockpit Rule applies to flight attendants as well as pilots, research has shown that the former may be reluctant to call the flight deck while the rule is in effect, even during emergencies. For example: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also noted that: > Many flight attendants do not have a clear understanding of what \\"sterile > cockpit\\" means. Flight attendants need to be given specific information > about what type of information merits contacting flight crewmembers during > the sterile period. Hesitancy or reluctance on the part of a flight > attendant to contact the flight crewmembers with important safety > information because of a misconception of the sterile cockpit rule is > potentially even more serious than the unnecessary distraction caused by > needless violations of the sterile cockpit Japan Airlines (JAL) took this a step further, describing in a flight attendant training manual several situations that would warrant flight- attendant-to-pilot communication during take-off and landing. Such situations included: * Any outbreak of fire; * The presence of smoke in the cabin; * Any abnormality in the attitude of the aircraft during take-off and landing; * The existence of any abnormal noise or vibration, and; * The observance of any fuel or other leakages. JAL also included guidance on when to make the calls to the pilots (\\"upon discovery of any abnormality\\"), what to call (\\"even [when] not absolutely sure, make the call\\") and how to call (\\"use the pilot call for emergency communication\\").

History Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Uppal campus CDFD was conceptualised by then CCMB director Lalji Singh. It evolved into its current form of a modern institution encompassing both basic and applied research in diverse areas of modern biology under its founder director, Seyed E. Hasnain (former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hyderabad), who pursued this aim aggressively during his tenure from 1999 to 2005. The centre is equipped with instrumentation and computing infrastructure to facilitate working in frontier areas of research in Life Sciences. There are twenty two groups working on diverse research areas and the centre continues to attract leaders in related disciplines. Campus CDFD started its operations at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research organisation, and was housed in an interim building in Nacharam from early 1999 to December 2008. In 2009, it was moved to a sprawling new building in Gandipet locality at the outskirts of Hyderabad. But, due to some of the governmental objections pertaining to the proximity of the new campus to Osman Sagar lake, any of the wet-lab work was not allowed. As a result, the building raised at Gandipet was completely vacated by CDFD in early 2009 and institute operated from its rented building in Nampally and with an MoU for the diagnostic screening with the Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS). Following the appointment of Dr. Debashis Mitra as its new Director w.e.f. 1 November 2017, CDFD commenced its move to its permanent campus in Uppal, and as of 15 March 2018 the institute is housed in its permanent building next to Nagole Metro Station.

She also won the Queen's Plate in 2011 and 2020, the Prince of Wales Stakes in 2016 and 2020, and the Breeder's Stakes in 2014 Born in Scarborough, Ontario, Carroll undertook an equine studies course at Humber College before embarking on a racing career in 1975 in the employ of Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame trainer Mac Benson at Windfields Farm. She worked as an assistant trainer until 1994. She had early success with Tethra, owned by members of the prominent Eaton family. In recent years she has been one of the leading trainers at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto and has won a number of graded stakes races both in Canada and in the United States. Prior to the 2006 winning run, she had had one horse compete in the Queen's Plate. Her 2006 entry, Edenwold, earned the Sovereign Award as Canada's top two-year-old in 2005, but observers of the sport believed the colt could not sustain the Queen's Plate distance of a mile and a quarter. Ridden by jockey Emile Ramsammy, her winning horse was considered a long shot, going off at 16-1 odds in the $1 million Grade I Queen's Plate. Carroll's first Grade I win came in 2009 with Careless Jewel, who won the Alabama Stakes. Carroll is the second female trainer to take Canada's most prestigious race for three-year-old fillies, the Woodbine Oaks with Inglorious in 2011 ‚Äì who went on to win the Plate for Carroll that same year. In 2019, she was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

She founded two hospices (\\"respices\\") for seriously ill young people. Early life Born Frances Dorothy Lyon Ritchie in Inverness, Scotland in December 1942, she and her mother lived for three years in Greenock, where her grandfather was a solicitor and a Church of Scotland elder. When her father was demobbed the family moved to Richmond and later Roehampton. Her younger brother, David Ritchie, was born when Frances was five years old and he had only one lung. Already knowing she wanted to be a nurse she helped to care for him at home and visited him when he was a patient in The Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street. She was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College before returning to Great Ormond Street to train as a paediatric nurse. During her training she was seconded to the Middlesex Hospital to do her General Training. Frances joined the All Saints Sisters of the Poor, an Anglican religious community in 1966. She made vows in 1969 and was made Novice Guardian in 1973. She was elected Mother Superior General in 1977 at the age of 34, a position she held for 12 years. Helen House Hospice Helen House, a hospice for children, was founded in 1982, inspired by two-year-old Helen Worswick. Sister Frances met Helen following surgery to remove a brain tumour, leaving Helen severely disabled. The friendship which developed between Frances and Helen and her parents proved the inspiration for the world's first children's hospice. More information on the work of Helen House today can be found at the Helen House website. A full account of the history of Helen House can be found in A House Called Helen, written by Helen's mother, Jacqueline Worswick. The hospice was created to offer respite care with or without family members, stepped discharge from hospital and end of life care for children from birth to 16. Practical and emotional support for the whole family for as many years as they needed were integral in the philosophy. The concept has now been replicated on all continents. Douglas House Recognising that young people with progressive life-shortening conditions were living much longer than they might once have done, Sister Frances went on to found Douglas House, a \\"respice\\" for people between the ages of 16 and 35 with life-shortening conditions. Named after a young man who had stayed many times in Helen House until he died aged 26, the house was opened by the Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2004. It is built in the same grounds as Helen House. Sister Frances's involvement with Helen and Douglas House came to and end in 2013 due to unproven allegations of abuse for which she was never charged and which were not associated with the hospices. In 2018, amidst the charity's financial problems, she called for her role as a trustee to be reinstated, so that she could help resolve the problems but this was not granted. Sister Frances is author of a book entitled Just My Reflection ... helping families to do things their way when their child dies first published in 1997. Recognition Sister Frances was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs. Sister Frances is a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Oxfordshire, and has received honorary degrees from four universities. She received the Templeton Project Trust Prize in 1986, was awarded an OBE in 2006 and Women of the Year award in 2007. In 2012 she was given a Lifetime Achievement award by Help the Hospices and the National Garden Scheme. She is a Fellow of The Royal College of Nursing and an Honorary Fellow of The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Sister Frances is Founder of REACT (Rapid Effective Assistance for Children with potentially Terminal illness}. She is the President of FACT (Falsely Accused Carers, Teachers and other professionals}.

He was a member of the New Zealand Under 19 side and is currently a member of the Auckland cricket team. He is the first player to score three Twenty20 International centuries.https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/colin-munro- becomes-first-batsman-to-hit-three-t20i-centuries-1621571.html Early life Munro attended Maidstone Primary School in Tongaat and after moving to New Zealand, attended Pakuranga College and played in the school's 1st XI cricket team. Munro represented New Zealand in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Sri Lanka in 2006. Domestic and T20 franchise career In 2012-13 he and Craig Cachopa added 377 runs for the sixth wicket against the Wellington Firebirds in the Plunket Shield, falling two runs shy of the sixth wicket partnership record. He scored the second highest score for the Auckland Aces of 269 unbeaten with 27 fours and 14 sixes behind Bill Carson's record score of 290 set back in 1936/37. In January 2017, Munro signed for the Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League and made his debut in front of 39,756 at the SCG against the Thunder. In March, 2018, as his international form in T20 not translating in ODIs, and with the 2019 Cricket World Cup looming, Munro decided to forego the rest of the 2017/18 and 2018/2019 Plunket Shield test seasons and focuses solely on white ball cricket. This also includes international Test cricket. In September 2018, he was named in Balkh's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament. In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Brampton Wolves franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. He was released by the Delhi Capitals ahead of the 2020 IPL auction. Ahead of the 2020 PSL Draft, he was released by Karachi Kings. In December 2019, he was drafted by Islamabad United as first pick of the Diamond Category round at the 2020 PSL draft. In June 2020, he was offered a contract by Auckland ahead of the 2020‚Äì21 domestic cricket season. In July 2020, he was named in the Trinbago Knight Riders squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League. International career He was selected for the New Zealand Test Cricket team to play South Africa in the 2nd Test of the NZ team's tour after an injury to James Franklin. This made him New Zealand Test Cricketer number #258. In 2016, after becoming the top scorer in the domestic T20 competition, where he bats at no.3, there were hopes for him to cement that spot before the ICC World T20, given Brendon McCullum's international retirement before the tournament. Munro was added to the series against Sri Lanka, after a great domestic season. He played the last ODI and 2 T20Is in the series. In the second T20I at Eden Park, Munro recorded the second fastest T20I fifty of all time in 14 balls, with seven sixes, only behind 12-ball fifty of Yuvraj Singh. This is also the fastest fifty by a New Zealander in this format, beating the previous record set by Martin Guptill (50 from 19 balls) just 20 minutes before. He was adjudged man of the match for this performance. On 6 January 2017 against Bangladesh, Munro scored his first Twenty20 International century, and became the third player for New Zealand to score a T20I hundred after Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill. With his century, New Zealand posted 195 runs in 20 overs and finally won the match by 47 runs. Munro was lifted to opening batting position during the ODI series against India, and he had good fortunes in the opening slot in a few matches. On 4 November 2017, in the second T20I of the Indian tour, Munro scored his second Twenty20 International century, becoming the second New Zealander (after McCullum) and fourth overall to score two T20I centuries. He was also the first batsman to score two T20I centuries in a year. New Zealand won the match by 40 runs and 3-match series was levelled 1-1 with his all-round contribution. During the series against West Indies, Munro moved up to open in the limited overs formats. On 3 January 2018, during the series against the West Indies, he became the first player to score three centuries in T20I cricket. With this feat, he became the no.1 T20I batsman in the world, while Ish Sodhi claimed the no.1 T20I bowler ranking at the same time, making them the first Black Caps pair to top the respective lists since Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori in 2008 and 2009. In May 2018, he was one of twenty players to be awarded a new contract for the 2018‚Äì19 season by New Zealand Cricket. Munro experienced indifferent form opening in ODIs against the Indian cricket team in New Zealand in 2018-19 but had more success in the T20s and was Player Of The Match in the 3rd match with a rapid 72. His form reflected that of the NZ team. He was also named in the T20 XI of the year 2018 by Cricinfo.http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2018/content/story/1169902.html In March 2019, he was named as the ANZ International Men's T20 Player of the Year at the annual New Zealand Cricket awards.

The length of the stents used in adult patients varies between 24 and 30 cm. Additionally, stents come in differing diameters or gauges, to fit different size ureters. The stent is usually inserted with the aid of a cystoscope. One or both ends of the stent may be coiled to prevent it from moving out of place; this is called a JJ stent, double J stent or pig- tail stent. Stent placement Three-dimensional reconstructed CT scan image of a ureteral stent in the left kidney (indicated by yellow arrow). There is a kidney stone in the pyelum of the lower pole of the kidney (higher red arrow) and one in the ureter beside the stent (lower red arrow). Ureteral stents are used to ensure the openness of a ureter, which may be compromised, for example, by a kidney stone or a procedure. This method is sometimes used as a temporary measure, to prevent damage to a blocked kidney, until a procedure to remove the stone can be performed. Indwelling times of 12 months or longer are indicated to hold ureters open, which are compressed by tumors in the neighbourhood of the ureter or by tumors of the ureter itself. In many cases these tumors are inoperable and the stents are used to ensure drainage of urine through the ureter. If drainage is compromised for longer periods, the kidney can be damaged. Stents may also be placed in a ureter that has been irritated or scratched during a ureteroscopy procedure that involves the removal of a stone, sometimes referred to as a 'basket grab procedure'. Stents placed for this reason are normally left in place for about a week. These stents ensure that the ureter does not spasm and collapse after the trauma of the procedure. Side effects and complications Abdominal X-ray showing a double J stent to relieve colics from kidney stones (red arrows). The stone obstructing the ureter is also visible (yellow arrows). The main complications with ureteral stents are dislocation, infection and blockage by encrustation. Recently stents with coatings, such as heparin, were approved to reduce infection and encrustation to reduce the number of stent exchanges. Other complications can include increased urgency and frequency of urination, blood in the urine, leakage of urine, pain in the kidney, bladder, or groin, and pain in the kidneys during, and for a short time after urination. These effects are generally temporary and disappear with the removal of the stent. Drugs used for the treatment of OAB (over active bladder) are sometimes given to reduce or eliminate the increased urgency and frequency of urination caused by the presence of the stent. Stents often have a thread, used for removal, that passes through the urethra and remains outside the body. This thread may cause irritation of the urethra. This may be increased for patients who were born with Hypospadias or other conditions that required a similar corrective surgery. Care must be taken to ensure that the thread is not caught or pulled, which may dislodge the stent. While the stent is in place, patients may carry on with most normal activities; however, the stent may cause some discomfort during strenuous physical activity. Work and other daily activities may continue as normal. Sexual activity is also possible with a stent, but stents with a thread may significantly hinder sex. The stent also can rest on the prostate gland in men, and with ejaculation/orgasm, the prostate may have movement that is discomforting to the patient, similar to severe cramping or irritation. One should approach sex differently with a stent, exercising caution. Removal Stents with a thread may be removed in a matter of a few seconds by pulling on the thread. This is often done by a nurse, but can be done by the patient. When removing the stent, constant, steady force should be applied, to avoid starting and stopping. Something should also be placed below the patient to catch any urine that leaks during removal. Stents without a thread are removed by a doctor using a cystoscope. The stent is removed by cystoscopy, an outpatient procedure. Cystoscopy involves placement of a small flexible tube through the urethra (the hole where urine exits the body). The procedure, which usually takes only a few minutes and causes little discomfort, is performed in an outpatient clinic or ambulatory surgery center. Most patients tolerate having the stent removed using only a topical anesthetic placed in the urethra. Immediately before the procedure, sterile lubrication containing local anesthetic (lidocaine) is instilled into the urethra. Since no intravenous line is inserted and there is no anesthesia, you do not have to be accompanied by anyone else and you can eat normally before and after the procedure. A ureteric stent may also be retrieved without the use of a cystoscope by means of a magnetic removal system. The stent inserted has a small rare earth magnet attached to its bladder end which dangles freely within the bladder. When the stent needs to be removed a small catheter with a similar magnet is inserted into the bladder and the two magnets connect and the catheter and stent can be simply removed. This eliminates the need for a costly and invasive cystoscopy in both adults and children.

Swallowtails are distinct from most other angelfish genera in that they have distinct male and female colour morphs so even though the species is the same you can keep two sometimes markedly different-looking individuals in the same aquarium. They are active swimmers and should be given adequate room particularly if a pair or more is to be kept. This busy lifestyle means that the blackedged angelfish requires regular feeding in order for them to keep in good health.

It is a predominantly quiet residential area of North Somerset, south east of the town of Weston-super-Mare. As well as a pub and church the village has a village hall, school (Locking Primary School), a small shop and post office, a hairdressers, a Chinese takeaway, a pet care shop, florist, pharmacy, cafe and petrol service station comprising car sales and a mechanical workshop. The village gave its name to RAF Locking, which has now closed and proposals are under consideration for an employment and residential development for the site that could deliver 25 hectare (62 acres) of employment space and up to 1,800 new homes. In July 2011, North Somerset Council gave planning permission for the ¬£50 million LeisureDome to be constructed on the site. It will contain a indoor ski slope, other leisure facilities and a number of shops and restaurants. History The village of Locking is small but has a long history. There is evidence of Roman settlements nearby. The name \\"Locking\\" has a Saxon derivation probably meaning \\"Locc's people\\" and it was in the Saxon period that the church and village grew. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. John Plumley, who at the time was Lord of the Manor, had been a supporter of the Duke of Monmouth and participated in the Battle of Sedgmoor. Following the rout of Monmouth's forces, Plumley returned to Locking, and when the King's men came looking for him, he was given away by his dog whose barking alerted them to Plumley hiding in a nearby tree. The manor was subsequently acquired by Edward Colston of Bristol. In 1708 he endowed the manor to free school (now Colston's School) he established in his home city. East of the village, close to RAF Locking is the site of Locking Castle a motte and bailey castle on Carberry Hill. It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within their area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Axbridge Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Weston-super-Mare county constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

Syed Simnan came from a place called Simnan in Iran. Travelling in the Kashmir valley, he came to Kulgam and liked the spot on a cliff overlooking the river Veshaw. He made Kulgam his permanent abode and was buried at the very spot which he had found fascinating. His 'aastan' is a draw from the population in and around Kulgam. The family of Syed Simnan is buried in a nearby village called Amun. Both the shrines have a masonry plinth and a wooden superstructure of deodars.

Stamped tiles, which were excavated from the site, indicated the taste and living standard of the population. These excavations speak of high culture, civic sense, social norms and art of the people living in first century AD. The Kutbal site and its findings, which belong to the Kushana period, are more significant in view of several religious and artistic practices that had flourished then and had travelled to far off places in the subcontinent.

He also posited that evolution is not reversible, known as Dollo's law. Together with the Austrian Othenio Abel, Dollo established the principles of paleobiology. Early life Louis Dollo was born in Lille, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, a scion of an old Breton family. He studied at the √âcole centrale de Lille, with geologist Jules Gosselet and zoologist Alfred Giard, both of whom influenced the young Dollo.Othenio Abel (1931), ‚ÄúLouis Dollo. 7 Dezember 1857‚Äì19 April 1931. Ein R√ºckblick und Abschied‚Äù, in: Palaeobiologica, 4. 321‚Äì344. In 1877, he graduated with a degree in engineering. After his graduation, he worked in the mining industry for five years, but simultaneously developed a passion for paleontology. In 1879, he moved to Brussels. Iguanodon spp. For three years, starting in 1878, he supervised the excavation of the famous, multiple Iguanodon find at Bernissart, Belgium. He devoted himself to their study as a scientific passion, initially concurrently with his engineering career.Dollo, Louis. ‚ÄúLe Centenaire des Iguanodons (1822‚Äì1922).‚Äù, in: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character 212 (1924): 67‚Äì78, 2 pl. In 1882 he became an assistant naturalist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. Dollo was given membership in the Soci√©t√© des sciences de Lille and the Geological Society of London. From 1882 to 1885, while he was head of the vertebrate fossil section of the Royal Institute, Dollo worked on reconstructing the skeletons of the iguanodons, as it was necessary to display them on their hind legs. The first one was assembled in the interior of an unused church that Dollo was using as a workshop. Twelve of those skeletons have been the principal attraction of the Museum of Natural Sciences at the Royal Institute. Dollo collaborated with his former professor Alfred Giard and the Universit√© Lille Nord de France. Dollo's law Around 1890, he formulated a hypothesis on the irreversible nature of evolution, known later as \\"Dollo's law\\".Dollo, Louis. Les Lois De L'√©volution. New York: Arno, 1893. According to his hypothesis, a structure or organ lost during the course of evolution would not reappear in that organism. This hypothesis was largely accepted until Michael F. Whiting's 2003 discovery that certain insects that had lost their wings regained them millions of years later.Michael F. Whiting, Sven Bradler & Taylor Maxwell, \\"Loss and recovery of wings in stick insects\\", in: Nature 421, 264‚Äì267 (16 January 2003) However, it was redeemed on the molecular level in 2009 as a result of a study on glucocorticoid receptors.Pagel, Mark (2009). \\"Human language as a culturally transmitted replicator\\"in: Nature Reviews Genetics (Macmillan Publishers Limited.) 10 (6): 405‚Äì15. doi:10.1038/nrg2560 . . Paleobiology Dollo continued his work with fossils, in addition to studies of dinosaurs and their ecology. He was among the first to see fossil animals as part of an ecosystem. Because of that, he was instrumental in the development of paleobiology, and he kept up an extensive correspondence with Othenio Abel, another famous early paleobiologist. He taught paleontology at the Free University of Brussels, beginning in 1909, and in 1912 received the Murchison Medal. Recently, the stochastic Dollo model is being used to analyze matrix of cognates statistically. In linguistics, this model permits a newly coined cognate to arise only once on a tree language.
