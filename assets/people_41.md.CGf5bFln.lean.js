Cork is composed of suberin, a hydrophobic substance. Because of its impermeable, buoyant, elastic, and fire retardant properties, it is used in a variety of products, the most common of which is wine stoppers. The montado landscape of Portugal produces approximately half of cork harvested annually worldwide, with Corticeira Amorim being the leading company in the industry.J. L. Calheiros E Meneses, President, Junta Nacional da Corti√ßa, Portugal. \\"The cork industry in Portugal\\" Cork was examined microscopically by Robert Hooke, which led to his discovery and naming of the cell. Sources Quercus suber (cork oak) bark, Portugal There are about 2,200,000 hectares of cork forest worldwide; 34% in Portugal and 27% in Spain. Annual production is about 200,000 tons; 49.6% from Portugal, 30.5% from Spain, 5.8% from Morocco, 4.9% from Algeria, 3.5% from Tunisia, 3.1% Italy, and 2.6% from France. Once the trees are about 25 years old the cork is traditionally stripped from the trunks every nine years, with the first two harvests generally producing lower quality cork. The trees live for about 300 years. The cork industry is generally regarded as environmentally friendly.Skidmore, Sarah, USA Today (August 26, 2007). \\"Stopper pulled on cork debate\\" Cork production is generally considered sustainable because the cork tree is not cut down to obtain cork; only the bark is stripped to harvest the cork. The tree continues to live and grow. The sustainability of production and the easy recycling of cork products and by-products are two of its most distinctive aspects. Cork oak forests also prevent desertification and are a particular habitat in the Iberian Peninsula and the refuge of various endangered species.Henley, Paul, BBC.com (September 18, 2008) \\"Urging vintners to put a cork in it\\" Carbon footprint studies conducted by Corticeira Amorim, Oeneo Bouchage of France and the Cork Supply Group of Portugal concluded that cork is the most environmentally friendly wine stopper in comparison to other alternatives. The Corticeira Amorim‚Äôs study, in particular (\\"Analysis of the life cycle of Cork, Aluminum and Plastic Wine Closures\\"), was developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, according to ISO 14040.PricewaterhouseCoopers/ECOBILAN (October 2008). Analysis of the life cycle of Cork, Aluminium and Plastic Wine Closures. Results concluded that, concerning the emission of greenhouse gases, each plastic stopper released 10 times more CO2, whilst an aluminium screw cap releases 26 times more CO2 than does a cork stopper. The cork oak is unrelated to the \\"cork trees\\" (Phellodendron), which have corky bark but are not used for cork production. Harvesting Cork extraction near Aracena, Spain Cork is extracted only from early May to late August, when the cork can be separated from the tree without causing permanent damage. When the tree reaches 25‚Äì30 years of age and about 24 in (60 cm) in circumference, the cork can be removed for the first time. However, this first harvest almost always produces poor quality or \\"virgin\\" cork (Portuguese corti√ßa virgem; Spanish corcho bornizo or corcho virgen). Bark from initial harvests can be used to make flooring, shoes, insulation and other industrial products. Subsequent extractions usually occur at intervals of 9 years, though it can take up to 13 for the cork to reach an acceptable size. If the product is of high quality it is known as \\"gentle\\" cork (Portuguese corti√ßa amadia,Amadio comes from and is synonym of amavio, \\"beberage or spell to seduce\\" (Dicion√°rio Houaiss da L√≠ngua Portuguesa), from amar, \\"to love\\". but also corti√ßa secundeira only if it is the second time; Spanish corcho segundero, also restricted to the \\"second time\\"), and, ideally, is used to make stoppers for wine and champagne bottles. The workers who specialize in removing the cork are known as extractors. An extractor uses a very sharp axe to make two types of cuts on the tree: one horizontal cut around the plant, called a crown or necklace, at a height of about 2‚Äì3 times the circumference of the tree, and several vertical cuts called rulers or openings. This is the most delicate phase of the work because, even though cutting the cork requires significant force, the extractor must not damage the underlying phellogen or the tree will be harmed. To free the cork from the tree, the extractor pushes the handle of the axe into the rulers. A good extractor needs to use a firm but precise touch in order to free a large amount of cork without damaging the product or tree. These freed portions of the cork are called planks. The planks are usually carried off by hand since cork forests are rarely accessible to vehicles. The cork is stacked in piles in the forest or in yards at a factory and traditionally left to dry, after which it can be loaded onto a truck and shipped to a processor. Properties and uses Varnished cork tiles can be used for flooring, as an alternative for linoleum, stone or ceramic tiles Cork's elasticity combined with its near-impermeability makes it suitable as a material for bottle stoppers, especially for wine bottles. Cork stoppers represent about 60% of all cork based production. Cork has an almost zero Poisson's ratio, which means the radius of a cork does not change significantly when squeezed or pulled. Cork is an excellent gasket material. Some carburetor float bowl gaskets are made of cork, for example. Cork is also an essential element in the production of badminton shuttlecocks. Cork's bubble-form structure and natural fire retardant make it suitable for acoustic and thermal insulation in house walls, floors, ceilings and facades. The by- product of more lucrative stopper production, corkboard is gaining popularity as a non-allergenic, easy-to-handle and safe alternative to petrochemical- based insulation products. Sheets of cork, also often the by-product of stopper production, are used to make bulletin boards as well as floor and wall tiles. Cork's low density makes it a suitable material for fishing floats and buoys, as well as handles for fishing rods (as an alternative to neoprene). Granules of cork can also be mixed into concrete. The composites made by mixing cork granules and cement have lower thermal conductivity, lower density and good energy absorption. Some of the property ranges of the composites are density (400‚Äì1500 kg/m¬≥), compressive strength (1‚Äì26 MPa) and flexural strength (0.5‚Äì4.0 MPa).Karade SR. 2003. An Investigation of Cork Cement Composites. PhD Thesis. BCUC. Brunel University, UK. =Use in wine bottling= stopper for a wine bottle As late as the mid-17th century, French vintners did not use cork stoppers, using instead oil-soaked rags stuffed into the necks of bottles.Prlewe, J. Wine From Grape to Glass. New York: Abbeville Press, 1999, p. 110. Wine corks can be made of either a single piece of cork, or composed of particles, as in champagne corks; corks made of granular particles are called \\"agglomerated corks\\". Natural cork closures are used for about 80% of the 20 billion bottles of wine produced each year. After a decline in use as wine-stoppers due to the increase in the use of synthetic alternatives, cork wine-stoppers are making a comeback and currently represent approximately 60% of wine-stoppers in 2016. High-speed air-gap flash image of a champagne bottle being uncorked Because of the cellular structure of cork, it is easily compressed upon insertion into a bottle and will expand to form a tight seal. The interior diameter of the neck of glass bottles tends to be inconsistent, making this ability to seal through variable contraction and expansion an important attribute. However, unavoidable natural flaws, channels, and cracks in the bark make the cork itself highly inconsistent. In a 2005 closure study, 45% of corks showed gas leakage during pressure testing both from the sides of the cork as well as through the cork body itself. Since the mid-1990s, a number of wine brands have switched to alternative wine closures such as plastic stoppers, screw caps, or other closures. During 1972 more than half of the Australian bottled wine went bad due to corking. A great deal of anger and suspicion was directed at Portuguese and Spanish cork suppliers who were suspected of deliberately supplying bad cork to non-EEC wine makers to help prevent cheap imports. Cheaper wine makers developed the aluminium \\"Stelvin\\" cap with a polypropylene stopper wad. More expensive wines and carbonated varieties continued to use cork, although much closer attention was paid to the quality. Even so, some high premium makers prefer the Stelvin as it is a guarantee that the wine will be good even after many decades of ageing. Some consumers may have conceptions about screw caps being representative of lower quality wines, due to their cheaper price; however, in Australia, for example, much of the non-sparkling wine production now uses these Stelvin caps as a cork alternative, although some have recently switched back to cork citing issues using screw caps. These alternatives to cork have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, screwtops are generally considered to offer a trichloroanisole (TCA) free seal, but they also reduce the oxygen transfer rate between the bottle and the atmosphere to almost zero, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the wine. TCA is the main documented cause of cork taint in wine. However, some in the wine industry say natural cork stoppers are important because they allow oxygen to interact with wine for proper aging, and are best suited for wines purchased with the intent to age. Stoppers which resemble natural cork very closely can be made by isolating the suberin component of the cork from the undesirable lignin, mixing it with the same substance used for contact lenses and an adhesive, and molding it into a standardized product, free of TCA or other undesirable substances.Diam Corks , The Wine Society Composite corks with real cork veneers are used in cheaper wines. The study \\"Analysis of the life cycle of Cork, Aluminum and Plastic Wine Closures,\\" conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and commissioned by a major cork manufacturer, Amorim, concluded that cork is the most environmentally responsible stopper, in a one-year life cycle analysis comparison with plastic stoppers and aluminum screw caps. =Other uses= $million/month), showing a peak in 2002 SEM image of cork (MUSE - Science Museum) The famous early (1665) micrograph of cork, drawn by Robert Hooke, and described in Micrographia, book written by him.

Since its inception, Oa has been the planetary citadel of the Guardians of the Universe and the headquarters of the Green Lantern Corps. It first appeared in Green Lantern vol 2 #1, when the Guardians summoned Hal Jordan's \\"energy duplicate\\" so they could hear of his origin.  History  One of the oldest planets in the universe, Oa serves as the home and headquarters for a race of blue-skinned powerful humanoids who have dubbed themselves the Guardians of the Universe. The Guardians administer the Green Lantern Corps, a group of powerful universal police officers equipped by the Guardians with green- colored power rings along with green lanterns with which to charge the rings. According to the story \\"Heart of a Star\\" in the Sandman: Endless Nights graphic novel, Oa's star is called Sto-Oa (the Light of Oa) by the children of the planet's inhabitants. Its location has been firmly established by numerous references in Green Lantern comics over the years. It was formerly the center of the universe until the events of Infinite Crisis. Oa's history is not clear; according to some stories, the Guardians originated on a planet called Maltus. These evolved Maltusians later moved to Oa and named themselves Oans. Oa became a convenient base of operations. Other stories had the Oans living there from the beginning. Oa appears primarily as a desert-like, lifeless planet except for the Guardians' city which contains the Corp Central Battery and various halls, living quarters, containment cells and training centers for the Green Lantern Corps. It serves basically as a planet-sized all-in-one police station, training grounds and prison. During a period where the planet had been abandoned and the Central Battery destroyed, Oa spent some time as a patchwork mosaic of cities from other planets similar to Battleworld. This transformation was due to a rogue Guardian driven insane by solitude. When the Guardians returned to Oa, Mosaic was kept as an experiment in inter-galactic cooperative living.Green Lantern Vol.3 #1-17Green Lantern: Mosaic #1-18 Green Lantern Corps member Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern of sector 2814 (which includes Earth), under the influence of the evil entity Parallax, kills all but one of the Guardians and most of the Corps before draining Oa's Central Power Battery of its energy.Green Lantern Vol.3 #50 During the final Zero Hour: Crisis in Time battle with Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner destroys the planet in an attempt to defeat Hal.Green Lantern Vol.3 #0 In the crossover Green Lantern vs the Silver Surfer, the Marvel Universe villain Thanos attempts to use the rift created by Oa's destruction to unmake the multiverse, after tricking Kyle into powering his equipment with his ring. Thanos is confronted by Parallax and their powers are drained by Kyle and the Surfer, apparently destroying the rift. During the Circle of Fire event, what remains of the planet served as a base of operations for the villain Oblivion. The planet is reformed sometime later by Jordan's old friend and associate Tom \\"Pie-Face\\" Kalmaku in the graphic novel Legacy: The Last Will and Testament of Hal Jordan. The Central Power Battery is later recharged and the Guardians resurrected shortly thereafter by Kyle Rayner after he spends some time as the near-omnipotent \\"Ion\\", Kyle sacrificing his power to restore the Guardians rather than risk becoming as dangerous as Hal-as-Parallax. After attacks by Superboy-Prime and the Spider Guild, the Guardians fortify Oa by creating a planetwide armor and defensive system to prevent attacks. The full capability of the new systems is still unknown. They were not, however, enough to prevent an assault by the Sinestro Corps, which resulted in the deaths of many Green Lanterns. Afterward, the Corps doubled its defenses. However, a rogue Guardian, Scar, weakened its defenses for an attack from the Black Lantern Corps. After Sinestro killed the Guardians for their \\"Third Army\\" plot and their part in Korugar's destruction by the First Lantern Volthoom‚Äîalthough he spared and exiled both Ganthet and Sayd‚ÄîHal Jordan became the new leader of the Green Lantern Corps. Shortly after this, the planet was attacked and destroyed by Relic.Green Lantern: New Guardians #24 (December, 2013) The Green Lanterns' new base of operations following the destruction of Oa became Mogo. Following the rebirth of the Guardians of the Universe and the Hal Jordan's victory over Hank Henshaw, it was revealed by Ganthet that the Guardians were rebuilding Oa in secret with the plans to restore it to what it once was,Green Lanterns #57 (October 2018) which is now referred to as \\"New Oa\\".The Green Lantern\\" #1 (November 2018) =Legion of Super-Heroes= It is revealed in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds that Sodam Yat is the last Guardian of the Universe in the 31st century, while Rond Vidar is the last remaining Green Lantern until he is killed by Superboy-Prime's Legion of Super-Villains. Oa lies mostly in ruins, the power battery cracked, and the rings of the Corps lie in a pile, unable to locate new bearers due to the apparent death of Mogo. Statues of legendary Green Lantern Corps members, including Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, John Stewart, Kyle Rayner, Arisia, and Ch'p, line the hall where the Guardians formerly met.

The executive chef, Greet, specializes in replicating dishes from across the universe. He, unfortunately, has trouble replicating the vast number of foods from Earth. *The Foundry: Forge of the Green Lantern rings and the Green Lantern battery. It is underground about two miles from the Central Power Battery and is guarded by an alien creature. *Hall of Great Service: Housing the massive Book of Oa‚Äîthe Corps' lawbook and bible‚Äîthe Hall of Great Service is a library of the stories and deeds of the finest Green Lanterns of all time.

The hazard simulation facility allows for safe, non-lethal training scenarios to be enacted. *Meeting Hall: Lanterns receive their briefings and assignments in the central meeting hall. *Memorial Hall: A memorial erected to Green Lanterns who lost their lives in the line of duty. A Green Lantern named Morro and his pet dratures are its crypt keepers. *New Warriors: A new restaurant owned by Guy Gardner, serving Earth's American fast foods, dinners, and both non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. *The Sciencells: The sciencells were constructed to contain the most ruthless criminals in the universe. They currently hold such prisoners as Lyssa Drak, Evil Star, Igneous Man, Grayven, and Alexander Nero. Superboy-Prime was the only inmate who wasn't imprisoned in a sciencell. The Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps sent him to a quantum containment field surrounded by a red Sun- Eater and guarded by fifty Green Lanterns. The Green Lantern Voz acts as warden of the sciencells. No inmate has ever been rehabilitated successfully. *Sector Houses: These safe houses allow Lanterns to hold criminals as they await escort back to the Oan sciencells. Limited recreational facilities are available to accommodate Green Lanterns in their travels.  Book of Oa  After Thomas Kalmaku used Jordan's ring to rebuild Oa, Kyle Rayner used his power as Ion to resurrect the Guardians. The book of Oa is now restored. The Forbidden Chapter of the Book tells the prophecy of the Blackest Night, the final destruction of the Green Lantern Corps at the hands of their greatest enemies as it was told to Abin Sur by the demons of Ysmault. Upon recruitment, a Green Lantern is expected to uphold certain principles of their duty. These principles include: # The protection of life and liberty within the assigned sector. # Following the orders of the Guardians without question. # Noninterference with a planet's culture, political structure, or its population's collective will. # Acting within local laws and obeying the local authority within reason (presumably, the Guardians' orders can overrule this when necessary). # Taking no action against anyone or anything until they are proven to be a threat against life and liberty. # Avoiding the use of equipment, resources or authority of the Corps for personal gain. # Showing respect for and cooperating with other members of the Corps and the Guardians. # Showing respect for life which includes restraint of force unless there is no reasonable alternative. # Giving top priority to the greatest danger in the assigned sector. # Upholding the honor of the Corps. The book of Oa has been designated off-limits after being rewritten by the Guardians of the Universe to include ten new laws. Only the first four have been revealed: # Lethal force is authorized against the Sinestro Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #23 (November 2007) # Lethal force is authorized against all enemies of the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #28 (April 2008) This law was later repealed by Corps leader John Stewart during the war against the Darkstars, believing that the Green Lanterns are more than about winning battles, and need to focus on winning the love and support of the universe around them to prove their way of standing up for Justice is better than the Darkstars way of executing known criminals.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps (vol. 1) #48 (July 2018) # Physical relationships and love between Green Lanterns is forbidden within the Corps.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #31 (February 2009) This law is later repealed and relationships between Green Lanterns are allowedGreen Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #47 (June 2010) following the Blackest Night event. # The Vega System is no longer outside of Green Lantern Corps' jurisdiction.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #40 (May 2009) When the new laws are written, the book is revealed to be written in Interlac, which is the galactic universal language used by the 30th and 31st Century United Planets and Legion of Super-Heroes. To enforce these principles, the Guardians closely monitor the activities of the Lanterns. If they feel a violation of Corps regulations occurred, they will summon the offender to Oa and hold a trial in which the charges are read and the Lantern is allowed to explain their actions. If the Guardians are not satisfied by the explanation, they have a number of disciplinary options which include: *Probation *Personal supervision by the Guardians on Oa *Temporary exile from the Lantern's homeworld *Ritual Trial of Endurance (a Lantern must attempt a dangerous passage through the Anti-Matter Universe) *Expulsion from the Corps *Prime Duty (when Superboy-Prime was an Oan prisoner, guard duty was used for punishment) In other media =Television= * Oa appears in the animated series Justice League.

The character is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. The Thing was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and he first appeared in The Fantastic Four #1 (cover-dated Nov. 1961). The character is known for his trademark rocky appearance, sense of humor, and famous battle cry, \\"It's clobberin' time!\\" The Thing's speech patterns are loosely based on those of Jimmy Durante.Stan's Soapbox, Bullpen Bulletins, September 1997 Michael Bailey Smith played Ben Grimm in his human form while Carl Ciarfalio played The Thing in The Fantastic Four film from 1994, Michael Chiklis portrayed the Thing in the 2005 film Fantastic Four and its 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, while Jamie Bell acted the part in Fantastic Four (2015). In 2011, IGN ranked the Thing 18th in the \\"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\\", and 23rd in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\" in 2012. The Thing was named Empire magazine's tenth of \\"The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters\\" in 2008. Publication history Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961). Kirby modeled the character after himself. In addition to appearing in the Fantastic Four, the Thing has been the star of Marvel Two-in-One, Strange Tales (with his fellow Fantastic Four member the Human Torch), and two incarnations of his own eponymous series, as well as numerous miniseries and one-shots. =Strange Tales= The Thing joined his Fantastic Four partner and frequent rival the Human Torch in #124 (1964) of Strange Tales, which previously featured solo adventures of the Human Torch and backup Doctor Strange stories. The change was intended to liven the comic through the always humorous chemistry between the Torch and the Thing. They were replaced in #135 (1965) with the \\"modern-day\\" version of Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., who had already been appearing in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos. =Marvel Two-in-One (1974‚Äì1983)= After a 1973 try-out in two issues of Marvel Feature, the Thing starred in the long-running series Marvel Two-in-One. In each issue, Ben Grimm would team up with another character from the Marvel Universe, often an obscure or colorful character. The series helped to introduce characters from Marvel's lineup, by way of teaming up with the more recognizable Thing. In 1992, Marvel reprinted four Two-in-One stories (#50, 51, 77 and 80) as a miniseries under the title The Adventures of the Thing. The series was cancelled after 100 issues and seven annuals to make way for a solo series. =The Thing (1983‚Äì1986)= The cancellation of Marvel Two- in-One led to the Thing's first completely solo series, which ran for 36 issues. It was originally written by John Byrne and later, Mike Carlin. The series also featured art by Ron Wilson and later by Paul Neary. It elaborated on Ben Grimm's poor childhood on Yancy Street in its early issue, and chronicled the Thing's later foray into the world of professional wrestling. It also featured a major storyline offshoot from Marvel's Secret Wars event, in which the Thing elects to remain on the Beyonder's Battleworld after discovering that the planet enables him to return to human form at will. A full third of the series' stories take place on Battleworld. =2002‚Äìpresent= In 2002, Marvel released The Thing: Freakshow, a four-issue miniseries written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Scott Kolins, in which the Thing travels across the United States by train, inadvertently stumbling on a deformed gypsy boy he once ridiculed as a teenager, who is now the super- strong main attraction of a troupe of traveling circus freaks. He later discovers a town full of alien Kree and Skrull warriors fighting over a Watcher infant. In 2003, Marvel released a four-issue miniseries written by Evan Dorkin and illustrated by Dean Haspiel, The Thing: Night Falls on Yancy Street. The story was more character-driven than the stories that usually feature the Thing. Tom Spurgeon found its outlook on relationships \\"depressing\\". After the success of the 2005 Fantastic Four feature film and events in the comics series that resulted in Grimm becoming a millionaire, the Thing was once again given his own series in 2005, The Thing, written by Dan Slott and penciled by Andrea Di Vito and Kieron Dwyer. It was canceled with issue #8 in 2006. The Thing was a member of The New Avengers, when that team debuted in their self-titled series in 2010.\\"I Am A New Avenger\\", Marvel Comics, 1 March 2010. He appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010‚Äì2013 New Avengers series, from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through its final issue #34 (Jan. 2013). Fictional character biography =Background= Born on Yancy Street in New York City's Lower East Side, to a Jewish family, Benjamin Jacob \\"Ben\\" Grimm had an early life of poverty and hardship, shaping him into a tough, streetwise scrapper. His older brother Daniel, whom Ben idolized, was killed in a street gang fight when Ben was eight years old. This portion of his own life is modeled on that of Jack Kirby, who grew up on tough Delancey Street, whose brother died when he was young, whose father was named Benjamin, and who was named Jacob at birth. Following the death of his parents, Ben was raised by his Uncle Jake (who had married a much younger wife, Petunia, who would become a frequent reference used by the character until her death\\"Doom's Master, Part Three\\".

Excelling in football as a high school student, Ben received a full scholarship to Empire State University, where he first met his eventual lifelong friend in a teenaged genius named Reed Richards, as well as future enemy Victor von Doom.Fantastic Four Annual #2. Marvel Comics. Despite their being from radically different backgrounds, science student Richards described to Grimm his dream of building a space rocket to explore the regions of space around Mars; Grimm jokingly agreed to fly that rocket when the day came. The details of his life story have been modified over the decades. Prior to the stories published in the 1970s, Grimm, after earning multiple advanced degrees in engineering, served in the United States Marine Corps as a test pilot during World War II.Fantastic Four #367.

Marvel Comics. Religion In keeping with an early taboo in the comic superhero world against revealing a character's religion, the fact that Grimm was Jewish was not explicitly revealed until four decades after his creation, in the story \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" in Fantastic Four vol. 3, #56 (Aug. 2002). Marvel Comics. In this story, Grimm returns to his old neighborhood to find Mr. Sheckerberg, a pawn shop owner he had known as a child. Flashbacks during this story reveal Grimm's Jewish heritage. He recites the Shema, an important Jewish prayer often recited, over the dying Sheckerberg, who eventually recovers. In a later story, Grimm agrees to celebrate his Bar Mitzvah, since it has been 13 years, the age a Jewish boy celebrates his Bar Mitzvah, since he began his \\"second life\\" as the Thing. To celebrate the ceremony, Grimm organizes a poker tournament for every available superhero in the Marvel Universe.Byrne, John (w), Wilson, Ron (p), Barta, Hilary (i). \\"Ancient Evenings, Ancient Pain\\", The Thing vol. 2, #8.

Marvel Comics. Out of universe, Jack Kirby featured the Thing on his family's 1976 Hanukkah card. =The Thing= Some years later, Reed Richards, now a successful scientist, once again makes contact with Grimm. Richards has built his spaceship, and reminds Grimm of his promise to fly the ship. After the government denies him permission to fly the spaceship himself, Richards plots a clandestine flight piloted by Grimm and accompanied by his future wife Susan Storm, who had helped provide funding for the rocket, and her younger brother Johnny Storm, who helped the group gain access to the launch system. Although reluctant to fly the rocket, Ben is persuaded to do so by Sue, for whom he has a soft spot. During this unauthorized ride into the upper atmosphere of Earth and the Van Allen Belts, they are pelted by a cosmic ray storm and exposed to radiation against which the ship's shields are no protection. Upon crashing down to Earth, each of the four learn that they have developed fantastic superhuman abilities. Grimm's skin is transformed into a thick, lumpy orange hide, which gradually evolves into his now-familiar craggy covering of large rocky plates. Richards proposes the quartet band together to use their new abilities for the betterment of humanity, and Grimm, in a moment of self-pity, adopts the super-heroic sobriquet, the Thing. The team clashes with the Mole Man in their first appearance. Trapped in his monstrous form, Grimm is an unhappy yet reliable member of the team. He trusts in his friend Reed Richards to one day develop a cure for his condition. However, when he encounters blind sculptress Alicia Masters,Fantastic Four #8. Marvel Comics. Grimm develops an unconscious resistance to being transformed back to his human form. Subconsciously fearing that Masters prefers him to remain in the monstrous form of the Thing, Grimm's body rejects various attempts by Richards to restore his human form, lest he lose Masters' love. Grimm has remained a stalwart member of the Fantastic Four for years. The Thing first fought the Hulk early in his career,Fantastic Four #12. Marvel Comics. with many such further clashes over the years. Not long after that, he is first reverted to his human form, but is then restored to his Thing form to battle Doctor Doom.Fantastic Four #38-40. Marvel Comics. Grimm has been temporarily replaced on the team twice. First, after Grimm temporarily lost his powers and reverted to human form,Fantastic Four #167 (Feb. 1976). Marvel Comics. Reed Richards hired Luke Cage (then using the code name \\"Power Man\\") to take his place until Richards had completed a Thing-suit for Ben (however, Ben unexpectedly reverted into the actual Thing again later on).Fantastic Four #168 (March 1976).

Years later, after Grimm chose to remain on Battleworld in the aftermath of the \\"Secret Wars\\" due to his apparent control over his transformation between his human and mutated states, he asked the She-Hulk to fill in for him, Mister Fantastic did leave him with the device needed to return to Earth when it comes time.Secret Wars #12 (April 1985).

Eventually, he returns to his surrogate family as leader of the Fantastic Four when Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman leave the team to raise their son Franklin, at which point Ben invites Crystal and Ms. Marvel II (Sharon Ventura) to fill their slots.Fantastic Four #307. Marvel Comics. Soon after Sharon and Ben are irradiated with cosmic rays, Sharon becomes a lumpy Thing much like Ben was in his first few appearances, while Ben mutates into a new rockier, more powerful form.Fantastic Four #310. Marvel Comics. After being further mutated into the more monstrous rocky form, Ben is briefly changed back to his human form, and returned leadership of the Fantastic Four to Reed Richards.Fantastic Four #326-327. Marvel Comics. Grimm once more returned to his traditional orange rocky form, out of love for Ms. Marvel.Fantastic Four #350. Marvel Comics. He remains a steadfast member of the Fantastic Four. =In the 21st century= In a Fantastic Four comic published in 2005, Ben learns that he is entitled to a large sum of money, his share of the Fantastic Four fortune, which Reed Richards had never touched, as he had the shares of the other teammates (who were family members) in order to pay off various debts of the group. The Thing uses his newfound wealth to build a community center in his old neighborhood on Yancy Street, the \\"Grimm Youth Center\\". Thinking the center is named after the Thing himself, the Yancy Street Gang plans to graffiti the building exterior, but discovers the building was actually named after Daniel Grimm, Ben's deceased older brother and former leader of the gang. The relationship between the Yancy Streeters and the Thing is then effectively reconciled, or at least changed to a more good-natured, playful rivalry (as exemplified by the comic ending, with Yancy Streeters spray-painting the sleeping Thing). Some personality traits of the cantankerously lovable, occasionally cigar-smoking, Jewish native of the Lower East Side are popularly recognized as having been inspired by those of co- creator Jack Kirby, who in interviews has said he intended Grimm to be an alter ego of himself. =Civil War/The Initiative= Initially in the 2006 storyline \\"Civil War\\", Ben is a reluctant member of the pro-registration side of the controversy over the 2006 Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA), until he witnesses a battle on Yancy Street in which Captain America's forces try to rescue captured allies held by Iron Man's forces. The Fantastic Four's foes the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master try to escalate the battle, using a mind-controlled Yancy Streeter to deliver a bomb. The young man dies and the Thing verbally blasts both sides for not caring about the civilians caught in the conflict. He announces that, while he thinks the registration is wrong, he is also not going to fight the government and is thus leaving the country for France. While in France he meets Les H√©ros de Paris (The Heroes of Paris).Fantastic Four #539. Marvel Comics. Ben returns to New York as both sides of the SHRA battle in the city. Indifferent to choosing sides, Ben focuses on protecting civilians from harm.Millar, Mark (w), McNiven, Steve (p), Vines, Dexter (i). \\"Civil War, Part Seven of Seven\\", Civil War #7. Marvel Comics. In Fantastic Four #543 (March 2007), Ben celebrates the Fantastic Four's 11th anniversary along with the Human Torch, and late-comers Reed and Sue. The aftermath of the Civil War is still being felt in this issue, as Ben and Johnny (and even Franklin) consider the future of the team and Reed and Sue's marriage. When Reed and Sue arrive near issue's end, they announce that they are taking a break from the team and have found two replacement members: Black Panther, and Storm of the X-Men. The title of the story in this issue is a quote from Ben, \\"Come on, Suzie, don't leave us hangin'.\\"McDuffie, Dwayne. \\"C'Mon, Suzie, Don't Leave Us Hangin'\\", Fantastic Four #543.

During the 2017 \\"Secret Empire\\" storyline, Thing appears as a member of the Underground, which is a resistance movement against HYDRA ever since they took over the United States, until the real Captain America returns, ending Hydra's empires and defeating his Hydra counterpart.Secret Empire #1-#10.

Thing and Human Torch were reunited with Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman to help alongside other superheroes who were part of Fantastic Four (including surprisingly X-Men's Iceman) fight the Griever at the End of All Things after Mister Fantastic persuaded the Griever to let him summon Thing and Human Torch. As Thing and his teammates finally return to 616, while Future Foundation stays behind to keep learning multiverse, Thing reveals to them that he and Alicia propose their wedding and about to get married soon. Although the Baxter Building is now owned by a new superhero team Fantastix, Thing allows his teammates to use his hometown Yancy Street as their current operation base.Fantastic Four vol. 6, #2-#4. Marvel Comics. Relationships The Thing is generally well liked by other heroes within the Marvel universe. Grimm's relationship with his teammates has been a close but occasionally edgy one given his temper. He and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) often argue and clash but they do respect each other. Grimm's first love interest was the blind Alicia Masters, and he was intensely jealous of her. When Johnny started a relationship of his own with Alicia Masters and they became engaged, Grimm was upset. However, he had to concede that, unlike himself and his stone- covered body, Johnny could \\"be a man\\".Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men (Feb. 1987 - June 1987). Marvel Comics. He agreed to act as best man at their wedding.Roger Stern (w), John Buscema (p), Sal Buscema (i). \\"Dearly Beloved\\", Fantastic Four #300 (March 1987). The relationship between Alicia and Johnny was ended with the revelation that the Alicia that Johnny fell in love with was actually Lyja, a member of the shape-changing alien race known as the Skrulls. The real Alicia, who was kept in suspended animation, was rescued by the Fantastic Four and reunited with the Thing. Ben began dating a teacher named Debbie Green.Millar, Mark (w), Hitch, Bryan (p), Hitch, Bryan; Currie, Andrew (i). \\"The New Defenders\\", Fantastic Four #558 (Aug. 2008). Marvel Comics.

Marvel Comics. Grimm is best friends with Reed Richards, whom he addresses with the nickname \\"Stretch\\", due to Richards' natural height and his ability to stretch his body. However, Grimm also holds Reed responsible for his condition, since Richards had dismissed the potential danger of the cosmic rays that gave them their powers, although Grimm had taken them very seriously. At times of real frustration towards Reed, Grimm refers to him simply as \\"Richards\\".Fantastic Four #141 (Dec. 1973). Marvel Comics.Fantastic Four #301 (April 1987). Marvel Comics. Grimm is the godfather of Reed and Sue's son Franklin, who affectionately calls him \\"Unca Ben\\". Powers and abilities The Thing's primary superhuman power is his great physical strength. Over the years, as a result of further mutation and rigorous training on machines designed by Reed Richards, his strength has increased dramatically. He is capable of surviving impacts of great force without sustaining injury, as his body is covered with an orange, flexible, rock-like hide. He is also able to withstand gunfire from high-caliber weapons as well as armor-piercing rounds. It is possible to breach his exterior, however, and he does bleed as a result. One such instance involved Wolverine's adamantium claws scarring The Thing's face.Fantastic Four #374 (March 1993) The Thing's highly advanced musculature generates fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him superhuman levels of stamina. When in his Thing form, he has only four fingers on each hand. The loss of one digit on each hand, and the increase in volume of the remainder, does not affect his manual dexterity. However, he has been shown doing things like holding a pencil and using it to dial a phone (even with rotary dials), or to push buttons on a keypad, to use devices that would ordinarily be too small for him. Aside from his physical attributes, the Thing's senses can withstand higher levels of sensory stimulation than an ordinary human, with the exception of his sense of touch. His lungs are possessed of greater efficiency and volume than those of an ordinary human. As a result, the Thing is capable of holding his breath for much longer periods of time. The Thing is an exceptionally skilled pilot, due to his time spent as a test pilot in the United States Marine Corps and as a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is also a formidable and relentless hand-to-hand combatant. His fighting style incorporates elements of boxing,Fantastic Four #19 (Oct. 1963) wrestling, judo, jujitsu, and street-fighting techniques, as well as hand-to-hand combat training from the military. On occasion, when Ben Grimm regained his human form and lost his Thing powers, he used a suit of powered battle armor designed by Reed Richards that simulated the strength and durability of his mutated body, albeit to a weaker degree. Wearing the suit, which was designed to physically resemble his rocky form, Ben continued to participate in the Fantastic Four's adventures. The first exo-skeletal Thing suit was destroyed after Galactus restored Ben's natural powers and form. A second suit was built (presumably by Richards) and used sporadically when Ben had been returned to his human form.Fantastic Four #170‚Äì175 (May‚ÄìOct. 1976). Marvel Comics. It has been revealed ‚Äî after Franklin and Valeria created a formula that allows Ben to become human for one week each year ‚Äî that Ben is almost immortal when in his Thing form, as he only ages when he is human. Reed and Nathaniel traveled over three thousand years into the future to see Ben still alive after all that time.Fantastic Four #605. Marvel Comics.

This incarnation of the Thing was a scrawny, teenaged \\"Benjy\\" Grimm who could transform into his heroic identity with his \\"Thing rings\\", one worn on each hand, by bringing his fists together to connect the rings (with the cry, \\"Thing ring, do your thing!\\"). * The Thing is a regular character in the 1994 Fantastic Four cartoon, voiced by Chuck McCann. * Thing later appears in the 1990s Spider-Man cartoon, voiced by Patrick Pinney.

Doctor Doom uses the information he gives Ben to steal the Beyonder's power and is only defeated when he turns his own weapon on him. After Spider-Man's side is declared victorious and his allies are to be returned to Earth, Thing commented that he would lose his ability to change back into Ben Grimm * The Thing also makes a single episode appearance in the 1990s Incredible Hulk cartoon, with Chuck McCann reprising Thing. The episode seems to place this show in the same continuity with the Fantastic Four cartoon of the same decade as this episode plays off the Hulk's appearance in the other show. She-Hulk flirted with him, but Ben chose to rekindle his relationship with Alicia Masters. Thing also fell for the pranks of the Yancy Street Gang as well. * Thing appears in Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes, voiced by Brian Dobson.

In the film, a small explanation is given for why his physical alterations are the most severe of the entire team as he is exposed to the cosmic cloud with the least amount of protection, being outside the space station carrying out surveys while the rest of the team were inside when the storm hit. He is briefly cured of his 'condition' when Victor von Doom powers a chamber Mister Fantastic made that can negate the cosmic radiation that transforms him. After learning that Doom perfected the process so that he could drain the power of the Thing and use it to enhance his own (prior to this it was assumed that Doom had been unaffected by the cloud as he was in the shielded core of the station), Grimm subjects himself to the chamber again so that he can turn himself into the Thing. In this film, the Thing is from Brooklyn, rather than the Lower East Side, and was engaged before his transformation, with his fianc√© leaving him as she cannot cope with his change and Ben meeting Alicia while drinking in a bar.  Chiklis reprised his role as The Thing in the sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, in which he has mostly accepted his appearance, accepting the occasional joke about his relationship with Alicia. He briefly swaps powers with Johnny (Human Torch) to demonstrate Johnny's odd condition, Johnny's powers having become unstable after his encounter with the Silver Surfer. When Victor shows himself Ben immediately charges him and threatens to break his neck. He is later one of three to let Johnny borrow his powers, using a crane to help Johnny separate Doom from the Surfer's board while Reed stays with the injured Sue. * Jamie Bell portrayed Grimm in Fantastic Four while also providing the voice and motion-capture for Thing.Fleming, Michael \\"Fox sets 'Fantastic' reboot\\", Variety, August 31, 2009.

While being brought to Area 57, Reed apologizes to Ben for not finding a cure for him. At the time when Victor von Doom returns from Planet Zero and plans to use it on Earth, Ben helps Reed, Susan, and Johnny fight Victor. * Tim Miller's original plans for Deadpool 2 involved having the Thing from the 2015 Fantastic Four film fighting against Juggernaut during the film's climax. However, while the studio approved the character's appearance, these were dropped once Miller exited out the project and the part went to Colossus. =Video games= * The Thing's first video game appearance was in 1984 in the Scott Adams adventure game Questprobe featuring the Human Torch and the Thing which was released for the following 8-bit platforms: Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and a DOS version for the PC. * The Thing's first console appearance was a cameo in the Spider-Man game based on the Spider-Man 1994 animated series for Sega Mega Drive and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

The conflict began when cattle companies started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area, many of whom were settlers who competed with them for land, livestock and water rights. As violence swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, it finally culminated in the Powder River Country when the ranchers hired gunmen to invade the county. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months. The events have since become a highly mythologized and symbolic story of the Wild West, and over the years variations of the storyline have come to include some of its most famous historical figures. In addition to being one of the best-known range wars of the American frontier, its themes, especially class warfare, served as a basis for numerous popular novels, films, and television shows in the Western genre. Background Conflict over land was a common occurrence in the development of the American West, but was particularly prevalent during the late 19th century, when large portions of the West were being settled by white Americans for the first time through the Homestead Acts. It is a period that one historian, Richard Maxwell Brown, has called the \\"Western Civil War of Incorporation\\", of which the Johnson County War was a part. In the early days of Wyoming most of the land was in public domain, which was open to stock raising as an open range and farmlands for homesteading. Large numbers of cattle were turned loose on the open range by large ranches. Each spring, round-ups were held to separate the cattle belonging to different ranches. Before a round-up, an orphan or stray calf was sometimes surreptitiously branded, which was the common way to identify the cow's owners. Lands and water rights were usually distributed to whoever settled the property first, and farmers and ranchers had to respect these boundaries (the doctrine was known as Prior Appropriation). However, as more and more homesteaders called \\"grangers\\" moved into Wyoming, competition for land and water soon enveloped the state, and the cattle companies reacted by monopolizing large areas of the open range to prevent newcomers from using it. They also forbade their employees from owning cattle for fear of additional competition, and threatened anyone they suspected to be rustlers. The often uneasy relationship between the larger, wealthier ranches and smaller ranch settlers became steadily worse after the harsh winter of 1886‚Äì1887, when a series of blizzards and temperatures of ‚Äì50 to ‚Äì40 ¬∞F (‚Äì45 to ‚Äì40 ¬∞C) followed by an extremely hot and dry summer, ravaged the frontier. Thousands of cattle were lost and the large companies began appropriating land and the water supply in the area. Some of the harsher tactics included forcing settlers off their land, setting fire to their properties, and excluding them from participating in the annual roundup. They justified these excesses on what was public land by using the catch-all allegation of rustling. Hostilities worsened when the Wyoming legislature passed the Maverick Act, which stated that all unbranded cattle in the open range automatically belonged to the cattlemen's association.Agnew, Jeremy, The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood, McFarland; 1st edition (2012) p.40. The cattlemen also held a firm grip on Wyoming's stock interests by limiting the number of small ranchers that could participate. =Wyoming Stock Growers Association= Many of the large ranching outfits in Wyoming were organized as the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (the WSGA) and gathered socially at the Cheyenne Club in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Comprising some of the state's wealthiest and most influential residents, the organization held a great deal of political sway in the state and region. The WSGA organized the cattle industry by scheduling roundups and cattle shipments. The WSGA also employed an agency of detectives to investigate cases of cattle theft from its members' holdings. Grangers and rustlers often intermixed with one another in the community, making it more difficult for the detectives to discriminate who were the criminals and the innocent. Rustling in the local area was likely increasing due to the harsh grazing conditions, and the illegal exploits of organized groups of rustlers were becoming well publicized in the late 1880s. Well-armed outfits of horse and cattle rustlers roamed across various portions of Wyoming and Montana, with Montana vigilantes such as the infamous Stuart's Stranglers declaring \\"War on the Rustlers\\" in 1884. June 7, 2007 Bandits taking refuge in the infamous hideout known as the Hole-in-the-Wall were also preying upon the herds. Frank M. Canton, Sheriff of Johnson County in the early 1880s and better known as a detective for the WSGA, was a prominent figure in eliminating these supposed criminals from Wyoming. Before the events in Johnson County, Canton had already developed a reputation as a lethal gunman. At a young age he had worked as a cowboy in Texas, and in 1871 started a career in robbery and cattle rustling, as well as killing a Buffalo Soldier on October 10, 1874. Historian Harry Sinclair Drago described Canton as a \\"merciless, congenital, emotionless killer. For pay, he murdered eight‚Äîvery likely ten‚Äîmen.\\" War =Early killings= Jim Averell, a Johnson County businessman, was lynched in 1889 for cattle rustling, although he owned no cattle On July 20, 1889, a range detective from the Association named George Henderson accused Ella Watson, a local rancher, of stealing cattle from a fellow rancher by the name of Albert John Bothwell. The cattlemen sent riders to seize Ella before capturing her husband Jim Averell as well. Both of them were subsequently hanged from a tree. This gruesome act was one of the rare cases in the Old West in which a woman was lynched, an event that appalled many of the local residents and paved the way for future conflicts in the war.Davis (2010) pp. 73-74 County Sheriff Frank Hadsell arrested six men for the lynching and a trial date was set. However, before the trial, threats were sent to the witnesses who would testify against the aggressors.Davis (2010) p.76 One of those witnesses was young Gene Crowder, who mysteriously disappeared under unknown circumstances before the trial. Another, Jim's nephew and foreman Frank Buchanan, disappeared from the county as well after a shoot-out with unknown suspects, and was presumed to be hiding or murdered. Ralph Cole, another nephew of Averell's, died on the day of the trial from poisoning. Enemies of the Association soon fought back. George Henderson, the range detective who had accused Ella Watson, was murdered by rustlers near Sweetwater Creek in October 1890, an obvious taunt to the Association. The cattle barons soon tightened their control and hunted down those who tried to oppose them. The double lynching of the Averells was followed by the lynching of Tom Waggoner, a horse trader from Newcastle, in June 1891. A friend of Waggoner named Jimmy the Butcher, who was once arrested for rustling from the Standard Cattle Company, was also murdered. August 07, 2016 Range detective Tom Smith killed a suspected rustler, and when he was indicted for murder, political connections of the Association secured his release. These killings would precipitate more hostilities and violence in the years to come.David Lavender, American Heritage History of the Great West, New Word City, Inc. (2014). Section V. ASIN B00PJOI4MS After the lynchings of their prominent competitors, the WSGA's control over the range was undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA) to compete with the WSGA. Upon hearing this, the WSGA immediately viewed Champion's association as a threat to their hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to stop their operations. However, the latter refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892. Soon, the prominent cattlemen sent out an assassination squad to kill Nate Champion on the morning of November 1, 1891.Davis (2010) p.101-102 Champion and another man named Ross Gilbertson were sleeping in a cabin in Middle Fork of Powder River when a group of armed men went inside. Two of them went in while another stood by outside. Champion was immediately awakened by the intrusion, and as the gunmen pointed their weapons at him, Champion reached for his own pistol hidden under a pillow and a shootout commenced. Champion successfully shot two of the gunmen; mortally wounding and killing Billy Lykins. The rest of the assassination squad subsequently fled. Champion was left uninjured except for some facial powder burns from the gunfight. In a subsequent investigation of the attack, the names of those involved were leaked to two ranchers: John A. Tisdale and Orley \\"Ranger\\" Jones. However, both men were ambushed while they were riding, which outraged many of the small ranchers and farmers in the county. By early 1892, violence had reached something of a peak; newspapers, such as the Big Horn County Rustler, published articles and speculations that a \\"war\\" was on the way.Davis (2010) p.129 =Invaders= Frank M. Canton, former Sheriff of Johnson County, was hired to lead the band of Texas killers The WSGA, led by Frank Wolcott (WSGA Member and large North Platte rancher), hired gunmen with the intention of eliminating alleged rustlers in Johnson County and breaking up the NWFSGA. By that time, prominent names in Wyoming started taking sides. Acting Governor Amos W. Barber supported the cattlemen, who blamed the small ranchers and homesteaders for the criminal activity in the state, while former cowboy and sheriff of Buffalo (the county seat of Johnson County), William \\"Red\\" Angus, supported the homesteaders, who believed that the cattle barons were stealing their land. In March 1892, the cattlemen sent agents to Texas from Cheyenne and Idaho to recruit gunmen and finally carry out their plans for exterminating the homesteaders. The cattle barons had always used hired guns from Texas to take out suspected rustlers and scare away the nesters in Wyoming. One particular act of violence perpetrated by the Texans was recounted by cowboy John J. Baker, where the Texans ambushed and killed nine trappers whom they mistook for rustlers in Big Dry Creek, Wyoming. They received a $450 bonus for the slaughter. Soon, 23 gunmen from Paris, Texas and 4 cattle detectives from the WSGA were hired, as well as Wyoming dignitaries who also joined the expedition. State Senator Bob Tisdale, state water commissioner W. J. Clarke, as well as William C. Irvine and Hubert Teshemacher, who had both been instrumental in organizing Wyoming's statehood four years earlier, also joined the band. They were accompanied by surgeon Charles Bingham Penrose as well as Ed Towse, a reporter for the Cheyenne Sun, and a newspaper reporter for the Chicago Herald, Sam T. Clover, whose lurid first-hand accounts later appeared in eastern newspapers. A total expedition of 50 men was organized which consisted of cattlemen and range detectives, as well as the 23 hired guns from Texas. To lead the expedition, the WSGA hired Frank M. Canton. Canton's gripsack was later found to contain a list of 70 county residents to be either shot or hanged, and a contract to pay the Texans $5 a day plus a bonus of $50 for every rustler, real or alleged, they killed. The group became known as \\"The Invaders\\", or alternately, \\"Wolcott's Regulators\\". John Clay, a prominent Wyoming businessman, was suspected of playing a major role in planning the Johnson County invasion. Clay denied this, saying that in 1891 he advised Wolcott against the scheme and was out of the country when it was undertaken. He later helped the \\"Invaders\\" avoid punishment after their surrender. The group organized in Cheyenne and proceeded by train to Casper, Wyoming and then toward Johnson County on horseback, cutting the telegraph lines north of Douglas, Wyoming in order to prevent an alarm. While on horseback, Canton and the gunmen traveled ahead while the party of WSGA officials led by Wolcott followed a safe distance behind. =Shootout at the KC Ranch= The first target of the WSGA was Nate Champion, who was at the KC Ranch (also known as Kaycee) at that time. They were tasked to perform the assassination that others had failed to carry out five months before. The group traveled to the ranch late Friday, April 8, 1892, quietly surrounded the buildings, and waited for daybreak. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men who were evidently going to spend the night on their way through were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin. As the gunmen opened fire on the cabin, Champion dragged the mortally wounded Nick Ray back to the cabin. The latter died hours later, and Champion was left besieged inside the log cabin alone. Champion held out for several hours, wounding three of the vigilantes, and was said to have killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and, as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. \\"Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once,\\" he wrote. The last journal entry read: \\"Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again.\\" The Invaders continued to shoot at the cabin while others managed to set it on fire. Nate Champion signed his journal entry and put it in his pocket before running from the back door with a six-shooter in one hand and either a knife or a rifle in the other. As he emerged, the Invaders shot him dead. The killers pinned a note on Champion's bullet-riddled chest that read, \\"Cattle Thieves Beware\\". Jack Flagg, who after escaping his pursuers, rode to Buffalo where he reported Champion's dilemma to the townsfolk. Sheriff Angus then raised a posse of 200 men over the next 24 hours and set out for the KC on Sunday night, April 10. =Siege of the TA Ranch= A map of the TA Ranch during the Johnson County War, depicting the positions of the Invaders, the posse, and the 6th Cavalry The WSGA group then headed north on Sunday toward Buffalo to continue its show of force. By early morning of the 11th however, news quickly came of a large hostile force heading towards them. They quickly rode and took refuge in the TA Ranch in Crazy Woman Creek. During their flight, one of the Texans by the name of Jim Dudley accidentally shot himself when his horse bucked and his rifle fell to the ground, discharging and hitting his knee. He was later escorted by two others to Fort McKinney to seek treatment, but died in the fort one or two days later from gangrene.Smith, Helena Huntington. The War on Powder River. University of Nebraska Press; First Paperback edition (December 1, 1967). pp. 211-212. The sheriff's posse finally reached the remaining Invaders holed up in a log barn at the TA Ranch, but the latter manage to hold them back, resulting in a siege that would last for three days. The posse surrounded the whole ranch, building pits on the ground for cover and killing the Invaders' horses to prevent them from escaping. The New York Times reported that twenty men tried to escape behind a fusillade, but the posse beat them back and killed three to five. Another Texas gunman named Alex Lowther accidentally shot himself mortally in the groin as he was crawling to safety from the barrage of bullets being fired by the settlers. March 20, 2005 As the siege dragged on, a settler rode off to Fort McKinney requesting to borrow a cannon but was turned down. A blacksmith named Rap Brown tried to build his own cannon, but it exploded when he first tested it. He then built a siege engine he called the \\"Ark of Safety\\"‚Äîa large, bullet-resistant wagon that would help the settlers get close to the ranch so they could throw dynamite at the Invaders. Fortunately for the Invaders, one of their members, Mike Shonsey, managed to slip from the barn and was able to contact Governor Barber the next day. Frantic efforts to save the WSGA group ensued, and two days into the siege, late on the night of April 12, 1892, Governor Barber telegraphed President Benjamin Harrison a plea for help. The telegram read: The barn at the TA Ranch, where the \\"regulators\\" were besieged by the sheriff's posse. Harrison immediately ordered the U.S. Secretary of War Stephen B. Elkins to address the situation under Article IV, Section 4, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which allows for the use of U.S. forces under the President's orders for \\"protection from invasion and domestic violence\\". The Sixth Cavalry from Fort McKinney near Buffalo was ordered to proceed to the TA ranch at once and take the WSGA expedition into custody. The 6th Cavalry left Fort McKinney a few hours later at 2 am on April 13 and reached the TA ranch at 6:45 a.m. as the settlers were about to use the Ark of Safety. Colonel J.J. Van Horn, the officer in charge of the unit, negotiated with Sheriff Angus to lift the siege, and in return the Invaders were to be handed to civilian authorities. The Sixth Cavalry took possession of Wolcott and 45 other men with 45 rifles, 41 revolvers and some 5,000 rounds of ammunition, before escorting them first to Fort McKinney and then to Cheyenne. The text of Barber's telegram to the President was printed on the front page of The New York Times on April 14, and a first-hand account of the siege at the T.A. appeared in The Times and the Chicago Herald and other papers. Arrest and legal action The WSGA group was taken to Cheyenne to be held at the barracks of Fort D.A. Russell as the Laramie County jail was unable to hold that many prisoners. They received preferential treatment and were allowed to roam the base by day as long as they agreed to return to the jail to sleep at night. Johnson County officials were upset that the group was not kept locally at Ft. McKinney. The general in charge of the 6th Cavalry felt that tensions were too high for the prisoners to remain in the area. Hundreds of armed locals sympathetic to both sides of the conflict were said to have gone to Ft. McKinney over the next few days under the mistaken impression the invaders were being held there. The Johnson County attorney began to gather evidence for the case and the details of the WSGA's plan emerged. Canton's gripsack was found to contain a list of seventy alleged rustlers who were to be shot or hanged, a list of ranch houses the invaders had burned, and a contract to pay each Texan five dollars a day plus a bonus of $50 for each person killed. The invaders' plans reportedly included eventually murdering people as far away as Casper and Douglas. The Times reported on April 23 that \\"the evidence is said to implicate more than twenty prominent stockmen of Cheyenne whose names have not been mentioned heretofore, also several wealthy stockmen of Omaha, as well as to compromise men high in authority in the State of Wyoming. They will all be charged with aiding and abetting the invasion, and warrants will be issued for the arrest of all of them.\\" The Invaders, however, were protected by a friendly judicial system, and they took advantage of the cattle barons' corruption. Charges against the men \\"high in authority\\" in Wyoming were never filed. Eventually the invaders were released on bail and were told to return to Wyoming for the trial. Many fled to Texas and were never seen again. In the end, the WSGA group went free after the charges were dropped on the excuse that Johnson County refused to pay for the costs of prosecution. The costs of housing the men at Fort D.A. Russell were said to exceed $18,000 and the sparsely populated Johnson County was unable to pay. Final killings Tensions in Johnson County remained high. On May 10, U.S. Marshall George Wellman, was ambushed and killed by locals en route to the small community of Buffalo. The incident received national attention, with Wellman being the only marshal to die in the war. Wellman was one of the hired guns who joined the Invaders, and his death was grieved by a large crowd. The 6th Cavalry, sent to relieve the county of its violence, was said to be influenced by intense local political and social pressure, and they were unable to keep the peace. One infamous event occurred when a group of men set fire to the Post exchange and planted a homemade bomb in the cavalry's barracks. Noted officer Charles B. Gatewood was seriously injured by the bomb blast in the barracks, shattering his left arm and ending his cavalry career.Kraft, Louis (2000). Gatewood & Geronimo. University of New Mexico Press. p. 166. . The 9th Cavalry of \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" was ordered to Fort McKinney to replace the 6th. In a fortnight the Buffalo Soldiers moved from Nebraska to the rail town of Suggs, Wyoming, where they created \\"Camp Bettens\\" to quell the local population. Reception from the settlers were negative and in one violent incident, a gunfight erupted between them and some Buffalo soldiers who entered the town. After being initially driven off, 20 more soldiers tried to capture those responsible for the shooting, but the locals fought back which resulted in one Buffalo Soldier being killed and two others wounded. Another two detachments were sent and this time the locals allowed the soldiers to investigate but no one was convicted. The event forced the Army to retire the regiment from the place on November, 1892.Buffalo Soldiers in Wyoming and the West In the fall of 1892, as the aftershock of the stand-off was still being felt throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction.Davis (2010) p. 270 On May 24, 1893, Nate Champion's brother, Dudley Champion, came to Wyoming looking for work and was shot and killed in cold blood. Fifteen miles from town, Dudley had come across the ranch of Mike Shonsey who, after seeing him, immediately grabbed a gun and fired at him. A coroner's inquiry ruled Shonsey's actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the officials could continue with the investigation. A year before Nate Champion's death, Shonsey actually met him near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Nate suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin.Davis (2010) p. 103 He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names of the rest of the assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Nate and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed in association with the Johnson County War. Aftermath Ella Watson was lynched in 1889 by wealthy ranchers who accused her of cattle rustling, a charge that was later shown to be false. Emotions ran high for many years afterward. Some considered the large and wealthy ranchers as heroes who had sought what they regarded as justice by using violence to defend what they regarded as their rights to rangeland and water rights, while others saw the WSGA as heavy-handed outlaw vigilantes running roughshod over the law.Davis (2010) pp. 272-273 A number of tall tales were spun by both sides afterwards in an attempt to make their actions appear morally justified. Parties sympathetic to the invaders painted Ellen Watson as a prostitute and cattle rustler, Jim Averell as her murderous partner in crime and pimp and Nate Champion as the leader of a vast cattle rustling empire, claiming that he was a leading member of the fabled \\"Red Sash Gang\\" of outlaws that supposedly included the likes of the Jesse James gang.Davis (2010) p. 128 These claims have since been discredited. While men frequently visited Watson's cabin, this was because she mended clothing for cowboys to earn extra money. While some accounts do note that Champion wore a red sash at the time of his death, such sashes were common. While the Hole in the Wall Gang was known to hide out in Johnson County, there is no evidence that Champion had any relationship to them. Parties sympathetic to the smaller ranchers spun tales that included some of the West's most notorious gunslingers under the employ of the Invaders, including such legends as Tom Horn and Big Nose George Parrot. Horn did briefly work as a detective for the WSGA in the 1890s, but there is little evidence he was involved in the war. =Political effects= Although many of the leaders of the WSGA's hired force, such as William C. Irvine, were Democrats, the ranchers who had hired the group were tied to the Republican party and their opponents were mostly Democrats. Many viewed the rescue of the WSGA group at the order of President Harrison (a Republican) and the failure of the courts to prosecute them a serious political scandal with overtones of class war. As a result of the scandal, the Democratic Party became popular in Wyoming for a time, winning the governorship in 1892 and taking control of both houses of the state legislature in that election. Wyoming voted for the Democrat William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 U.S. Presidential Election, and Johnson County was one of the two counties in the state with the largest Bryan majorities. =Economic analysis= Historian Daniel Belgrad argues that in the 1880s centralized range management was emerging as the solution to the overgrazing that had depleted open ranges. Moreover, cattle prices at the time were low. Larger ranchers also were hurt by mavericking (taking lost, unbranded calves from other ranchers' herds), and responded by organizing cooperative roundups, blacklisting, and lobbying for stricter anti-maverick laws. These ranchers formed the WSGA and hired gunmen to hunt down rustlers, but local farmers resented the ranchers' collective political power. The farmers moved toward decentralization and the use of private winter pastures.Daniel Belgrad, \\"'Power's Larger Meaning': The Johnson County War as Political Violence in an Environmental Context,\\" Western Historical Quarterly (2002) 33#2 pp. 159-177 in JSTOR Randy McFerrin and Douglas Wills argue that the confrontation represented opposing property rights systems. The result was the end of the open-range system and the dominance of large-scale stock ranching and farming. The popular image of the war, however, remains that of vigilantism by aggressive landed interests against small individual settlers defending their rights.Randy McFerrin and Douglas Wills, \\"High Noon on the Western Range: A Property Rights Analysis of the Johnson County War,\\" Journal of Economic History (2007) 67#1 pp. 69-92 By 1893, the WSGA was opened to the other small ranchers and farmers, finally ending their monopoly and control over Wyoming business interests. Previous practices of the WSGA, such as vigilantism and confiscation of cattle, were finally stopped. Many prominent leaders of the Association such as Frank Wolcott, Frank M. Canton and Tom Smith later left the area. Legacy A bronze statue memorial of Nate Champion erected near the Jim Gatchell Memorial Museum to commemorate his bravery during the Johnson County War. The Johnson County War, with its overtones of class warfare coupled with the intervention ordered by the President of the United States to save the lives of a gang of hired killers and set them free, is not a flattering reflection on the American myth of the west. The Johnson County War has been one of the best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows.Adamson, Lynda G., Literature Connections to American History, K-6, Libraries Unlimited (1998) p.245. The Banditti of the Plains, written in 1894 by witness Asa Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all but a few of the first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath's 1902 novel The Rustler, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers. The Virginian, a seminal 1902 western novel by Owen Wister, took the side of the wealthy ranchers, creating a myth of the Johnson County War, but bore little resemblance to a factual account of the actual characters and events.Frances McElrath, The Rustler: A Tale of Love and War in Wyoming, Bison Books (2002). xii. Jack Schaefer's popular 1949 novel Shane treated themes associated with the Johnson County War and took the side of the settlers.Shane Re-envisioned The 1953 film The Redhead from Wyoming, starring Maureen O'Hara, dealt with similar themes; in one scene Maureen O'Hara's character is told, \\"It won't be long before they're calling you Cattle Kate.\\" In the 1968 novel True Grit by Charles Portis, the main character, Rooster Cogburn, was involved in the Johnson County War. In the early 1890s Rooster had gone north to Wyoming where he was \\"hired by stock owners to terrorize thieves and people called nesters and grangers... . I fear that Rooster did himself no credit in what they called the Johnson County War.\\" February 8, 2011 Films such as Heaven's Gate (1980) and The Johnson County War (TV-movie, 2002) painted the wealthy ranchers as the \\"bad guys\\". Heaven's Gate was a dramatic romance loosely based on historical events, while The Johnson County War was based on the 1957 novel Riders of Judgment by Frederick Manfred. The range war was also portrayed in an episode of Jim Davis's syndicated western television series Stories of the Century, with Henry Brandon as Nate Champion and Jean Parker as Ella Watson.Jim Davis' Stories of the Century, Vintage Magazine (May 5, 1964). Issue #9 American Heroes Channel presented the Johnson County War in the 6th episode of their Blood Feuds series documentary. The story of the Johnson County War from the point of view of the small ranchers was chronicled by Kaycee resident Chris LeDoux in his song \\"Johnson County War\\" on the 1989 album Powder River. The song included references to the burning of the KC Ranch, the capture of the WSGA men, the intervention of the U.S. Cavalry and the release of the cattlemen and hired guns.

He was an able military commander and the most influential man in the Western Roman Empire for two decades (433454). He managed policy in regard to the attacks of barbarian federates settled throughout the Western Roman Empire. Notably, he mustered a large Roman and allied (foederati) army to stop the Huns in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, ending the devastating Hunnic invasion of Attila in 451, though another devastating invasion of the Huns occurred in the year after that. He has often been called \\"the last of the Romans\\". Edward Gibbon refers to him as \\"the man universally celebrated as the terror of Barbarians and the support of the Republic\\" for his victory at the Catalaunian Plains.Gibbon ch. XXXV  Biography  = Origins and family = Aetius was born at Durostorum in Moesia Secunda (modern Silistra, Bulgaria), around 391.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, p. 4 His father, Flavius Gaudentius, was a Roman general and described as a native of the Roman province of Scythia, although some have interpreted this as a topos and used to describe a Gothic origin.Thomas J. Craughwell, How the Barbarian Invasions Shaped the Modern World, Fair Winds, 2008, p.60 Google book Aetius' mother, whose name is unknown, was a wealthy aristocratic woman of ancestry from Rome or some other city in Italian peninsula.Jordanes, Getica, 176; Merobaudes, Carmina, iv, 42-43, and Panegyrici, ii, 110-115, 119-120; Gregory of Tours, ii.8; Zosimus, v.36.1; Chronica gallica 452, 100. Cited in Jones, p. 21. Before 425 Aetius married the daughter of Carpilio,Carpilio had been a comes domesticorum, commander of the imperial guard (Gregory of Tours, ii.8). who gave him a son, also named Carpilio.Carpilio went to Attila for an embassy (Cassiodorus, Variae, i.4.11) and remained at their court as an hostage for some time (Priscus, fr. 8). Later he married Pelagia, widow of Bonifacius, from whom he had a son, Gaudentius. It is possible that he had also a daughter, whose husband, Thraustila, avenged Aetius' death by killing emperor Valentinian III.Gregory of Tours, ii.8; Priscus, fr. 8; Cassiodorus, Variae, i.4.11; John of Antioch, fr. 201.3 and 204; Marcellinus comes, s.a. 432; Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, v.205; Hydatius, 167; Merobaudes, Carmina, iv (poem composed for the first birthday of Gaudentius); Additamenta ad chron. Prosperi Hauniensis, s.a. 455 (only source to cite Thraustila as son-in-law of Aetius). Cited in Jones, p. 21. = Early years and service under Joannes = Western Roman Empire in 395 As a boy, Aetius was at the service of the imperial court, enrolled in the military unit of the Protectores Domestici and then elevated to the position of tribunus praetorianus partis militaris, setting him up for future political eligibility.Gregory of Tours, ii.8; Jones, p. 21. Between 405 and 408 he was kept as hostage at the court of Alaric I, king of the Visigoths.Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire. XIII.I. p 241 In 408 Alaric asked to keep Aetius as a hostage, but was refused, as Aetius was sent to the court of Uldin, king of the Huns, where he would stay throughout much of the reign of Charaton, Uldin's successor.Gregory of Tours, ii.8; Merobaudes, Carmina, iv, 42-46, and Panegyrici, ii.1-4 and 127-143; Zosimus, v.36.1 According to some early historians, Aetius's upbringing amongst militaristic peoples gave him a martial vigour not common in Roman generals of the time.Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume I, Chap. XXXV (Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 1952), p. 559. In 423 the Western Emperor Honorius died. The most influential man in the West, Castinus, chose as his successor Joannes, a high-ranking officer. Joannes was not part of the Theodosian dynasty and he did not receive the recognition of the eastern court.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, 26-27. The Eastern Emperor Theodosius II organised a military expedition westward, led by Ardaburius and his son Aspar, to put his cousin, the young Valentinian III (who was a nephew of Honorius), on the western throne. Aetius entered the service of the usurper as cura palatii and was sent by Joannes to ask the Huns for assistance.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, 30 Joannes lacked a strong army and fortified himself in his capital, Ravenna, where he was killed in the summer of 425. Shortly afterwards, Aetius returned to Italy with a large force of Huns to find that power in the west was now in the hands of Valentinian III and his mother Galla Placidia. After fighting against Aspar's army, Aetius managed to compromise with Galla Placidia. He sent back his army of Huns and in return obtained the rank of comes et magister militum per Gallias, the commander in chief of the Roman army in Gaul.Cassiodorus, Chronica, s.a. 425; Gregory of Tours, ii.8; Philostorgius, xii.4; Prosp. s.a. 425; Chronica gallica 452, 100; Jordanes, Romana, 328; Jones, p. 22; Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, 31-33. = First Gallic campaigns = In 426, Aetius arrived in southern Gaul and took command of the field army.Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire. XIII.I. p 243 At that time Arelate, an important city in Narbonensis near the mouth of the Rhone, was under siege from the Visigoths, led by their king Theodoric I. Aetius defeated Theodoric, lifted the siege of Arelate, and drove the Visigoths back to their holdings in Aquitania.Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire. XIII.I. p 242 In 428 he fought the Salian Franks, defeating their king Chlodio and recovering some territory they had occupied along the Rhine.Philostorgius, xii.4; Prosp. s.a. 425 and 428; Chronica Gallia 452, 102 (s.a. 427); Cassiodorus, Chronica, s.a. 428. Cited in Jones, p. 22. In 429 he was elevated to the rank of magister militum; this was probably the junior of the two offices of comes et magister utriusque militiae, as the senior is known to have been the patrician Flavius Constantinus Felix, the most influential man in those years, and a supporter of Galla Placidia.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, p.76 In 430 the Visigoths led by Anaolsus attacked Arelate again but were defeated by Aetius.Merobaudes, Pan. 1.10 (Vollmer, ad loc.), Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, p.76 In May 430, Aetius and the Army accused Felix of plotting against him and had him, his wife, and a deacon killed. Once Felix was dead, Aetius was the highest ranking amongst the magistri militiae, even if he had not yet been granted the title of patricius or the senior command. During late 430s and 431 Aetius was in Raetia and Noricum, defeating the Bacaudae in Augusta Vindelicorum, re-establishing Roman rule on the Danube frontier, and campaigning against the Juthungi.Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire. XIII.I. p 244, Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, p.82 In 431 he returned to Gaul, where he received Hydatius, bishop of Aquae Flaviae, who complained about the attacks of the Suebes. Aetius then defeated the Franks, recapturing Tournacum and Cambriacum.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, p.83 He then sent Hydatius back to the Suebes in Hispania.Prosperus of Tirus, s.a. 429 e 430; John of Antioch, fr. 201; Hydatius, 92, 93 and 94 (s.a. 430), 95 and 96 (s.a. 431), 98 (s.a. 432); Chronica Gallia 452, 106 (s.a. 430); Jordanes, Getica, 176; Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, vii.233. Cited in Jones, pp. 22-23. = War with Bonifacius = Coin of Bonifacius Comes Africae (422-431 CE).CNG Coins While Aetius was campaigning in Gaul, there was an ongoing power struggle among Aetius, Felix, Bonifacius, and the emperor Valentinian's mother and regent Galla Placidia. In 427 while Bonifacius was away as governor (comes) of Africa, Felix caused him to fall into disfavour with Placidia. Bonifacius was eventually returned to favor by Placidia, but only after Felix had sent Sigisvult and two other armies against him when Aetius warned him of Felix's intentions. In 429, the Vandals exploited this power struggle and crossed over to Africa.Procopius of Caesarea, Bellum Vandalicum, i.3.14-22, 28-29; John of Antioch, fr. 196; Theophanes, AM 5931; Hydatius, 99; Prosperus, s.a. 427. Cited in Jones, p. 23. After the execution of Felix in 430, Aetius and Bonifacius remained as the empire's most influential generals, both constantly vying for the favor of Placidia. In 432 Aetius held the consulate, but Bonifacius was recalled to Italy and received warmly by Placidia. Bonifacius was given the rank of patrician and made the senior comes et magister utriusque militiae, while Aetius was stripped of his military command.Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire. XIII.I. p 248 Aetius, believing his fall now imminent, marched against Bonifacius and fought him at the Battle of Rimini. Bonifacius won the battle but was mortally wounded, dying a few months later. Aetius escaped to Pannonia and traveled to the court of his friend, Rua, the king of the Huns. With their help he returned to power, receiving the title of comes et magister utriusque militiae. Aetius then had Bonifacius' son-in-law, Sebastianus, who had succeeded Bonifacius as magister militum, exiled from Italy to Constantinople, bought the properties of Bonifacius, and married his widow Pelagia.CIL, v, 7530; Prosperus, s.a. 432; Chronica Gallica a. 452, 109 and 111 (s.a. 432), 112 (s.a. 433), 115 (s.a. 434); Chronica Gallica a. 511, 587; Additamenta ad chron.

Cited in Jones, pp. 23-24. = Campaigns against Burgundians, Bacaudae, and Visigoths = The Monza Cathedral Diptych, which may have been commissioned on Aetius' first consulship. It may also depict Stilicho. From 433 to 450, Aetius was the dominant personality in the Western Empire, obtaining the rank of magnificus vir parens patriusque noster (5 September 435) and playing the role of \\"protector\\" of Galla Placidia and Valentinian III while the Emperor was still young.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, p.94 At the same time he continued to devote attention to Gaul. In 436, the Burgundians of King Gundacar were defeated and obliged to accept peace by Aetius and Avitus; however, the following year he sent Hunnic foederati to destroy them.Sid. Apol. Carm. 7.234-240 Allegedly 20,000 Burgundians were killed in a slaughter which probably became the basis of the Nibelungenlied, a German epic.Hydatius, Chronicon, 110 That same year Aetius was probably in Armorica with Litorius to suppress a rebellion of the Bacaudae under a certain Tibatto. The year 437 saw his second consulship and the wedding of Valentinian and Licinia Eudoxia in Constantinople; it is probable that Aetius attended the ceremony that marked the beginning of the direct rule of the Emperor. At that time his general Litorius had broken the siege of Narbona and had turned the war in favor of the Romans. The following two years were occupied by a campaign against the Suebi and by the war against the Visigoths; in 438 Aetius won a major battle (probably the Battle of Mons Colubrarius), but in 439 the Visigoths defeated and killed Litorius and his Hunnic Foederati.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis 96-102, Prosp. s.a. 439, Hyd. Chronicon, 116 Aetius returned to Gaul after Vetericus had stabilized the situation, and defeated the Visigoths and obtained a treaty.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, pp. 102-103. On his return to Italy, he was honoured by a statue erected by the Senate and the People of Rome by order of the Emperor; this was probably the occasion for the panegyric written by Merobaudes.Annales Ravennates, s.a. 435; John of Antioch, fr. 201.3; Prosper of Aquitaine, s.a. 435, s.a. 438, s.a. 439; Cassiodorus, Chronica, s.a. 435; Chronica Gallica a. 452, 117 (s.a. 435), 118 (s.a. 436), 119 (s.a. 437), 123 (s.a. 439); Hydatius, 108 (s.a. 436), 110 (s.a. 437), 112 (s.a. 438), 117 (s.a. 439); Sidonius Apollinaris, vii.234-235 and 297-309; Merobaudes, Panegyrici, i fr. iib 11ff, i fr. iia 22-23, and ii.5-7; Jordanes, Getica, 176; ; Barnes, Timothy, \\"Patricii under Valentinian III\\", Phoenix, 29, 1975, pp. 166-168; Jones, pp. 24-26. In 443, Aetius settled the remaining Burgundians in Sapaudia, south of Lake Geneva. His most pressing concern in the 440s was with problems in Gaul and Iberia, mainly with the Bacaudae. He settled the Alans around Valence in 440 and along the Loire including Aurelianum in 442 to contain unrest in Armorica.Chron. Gall. s.a. 440, 442, 443, Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis,128 In Spain, Aetius was slowly losing his grip on the situation. In 441 he appointed Asturius Magister Militum per Hispanias, in order to put down the Bacaudae in Tarraconensis. He was recalled and Merobaudes defeated the Bacaudae of Aracellitanus in 443. In 445 the Romans had the Vandals attack Turonium in Gallaecia, followed by Vitus who campaigned with a combined force of Romans and Goths in 446, but was ultimately defeated.Hyd. Chronicn, 125, 128, 131, 134 The Bacaudae in Armorica revolted again in 447 or 448, and were put down by the Alans of Goar. As a result, the leader of the revolt Eudoxius fled to the court of Attila the Hun.Chronica Gallia 452, s.a. 448 In 449 the Bacaudae in Spain revolted and sacked Tyriasso, Caesaragusta, and Illerdensus. The Suebi also entered Tarraconensis to assist Basilius and his revolt.Hyd. Chronicon, 141-142 In 445 Majorian defeated a Frankish siege of Turonum, which was followed by a Frankish attack under Clodio in the region of Atrebatum, in Belgica Secunda.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis 136, Sid. Apol. Carm. 5.214 The foederati were stopped in an ambush near Vicus Helena, where Aetius directed the operations while his commander Majorian (later Emperor) fought with the cavalry.Chronica Gallica Anno 452, 133 (s.a. 438); Sid. Apol. carm. 5.210-218. Cited in Jones, p. 27. Jan Willem Drijvers, Helena Augusta, BRILL, , p. 12. However, by 450 Aetius had already returned to good terms with the Franks. In 449 Chlodio died, and the patricius supported his younger son Merovaeus's claim to the throne. Aetius adopted him as his own son and sent him from Rome, where he had been an ambassador, to the Frankish court with many presents.Priscus, fr. 16; Gregory of Tours, ii.7. It is possible that this happened after the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 (Jones, p. 27). = Hunnic Invasions of Gaul and Italy = The possible path of the Hun forces in their invasion of Gaul, leading up to the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains Before 449 Aetius had signed an agreement with the Huns, allowing some of them to settle in Pannonia, along the Sava River; he also sent to Attila, the king of the Huns, a man called Constantius as a secretary. In 449, Attila was angry over an alleged theft of a golden plate, and Aetius sent him an embassy under Romulus to calm him; Attila sent him a dwarf, Zerco, as a present, whom Aetius gave back to his original owner, Aspar.Priscus, fr. 7 and 8; Suda, Z 29. Cited in Jones, p. 27. However, the good terms between Romans and Huns did not last, as Attila wanted to attack Gaul; he knew that Aetius was a serious obstacle to his enterprise, and tried to have him removed, but in 451, when the Huns attacked, Aetius was still the commander of the Roman army in Gaul.John of Antioch, fr. 199.2; Jordanes, Getica, 191. Cited in Jones, p.27. The large Hunno-German armyHunnish armies were never composed entirely of ethnic Huns but contained relative majorities of subject peoples. captured several cities, and proceeded towards Aurelianum. Aetius, with the help of the influential Gallo-Roman senator Avitus, convinced the Visigoths of king Theodoric I to join him against the external menace; he also succeeded in persuading Sambida (who was falsely accused of planning to join the Huns), the Armoricans, the Salian Franks, some of the Saxons, and the Burgundians of Sapaudia to join his forces. Then the joint Roman and Visigothic army moved to relieve the besieged city of Aurelianum, forcing the Huns to abandon the siege and retreat to open country.Sidonius Apollinaris, vii.328-331, 339-341; John Malalas, 358; Jordanes, Getica, 195; Gregory of Tours, ii.7. Cited in Jones, p.27. On June 20, 451Bury, J.B., 1923, Chapter 9, ¬ß 4. Aetius and Theodoric engaged Attila and his allies at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains.Chronica Gallica a. 452, 139 (s.a. 451), 141 (s.a. 452); Cassiodorus, Chronica, 451; Additamenta ad chron.

Cited in Jones, p. 27. Theodoric died in the battle, and Aetius suggested his son Thorismund retreat to Tolosa to secure his throne, and persuaded Merovaeus to return to the lands of the Franks; for this reason it is said that Aetius kept all of the battlefield loot for his army.Gregory of Tours, 2.7; Jordanes, Getica, 215ff. Cited in Jones, pp. 27-28. Attila returned in 452 to again press his claim of marriage to Honoria; Aetius was unable to block Attila's advance through the Julian Alps. Instead, he chose to garrison Aquileia against Attila's onslaught.Prosper, s.a. 452; Jordanes, De Origine Actibusque Getarum 42.219. Attila invaded and ravaged Italy, sacking numerous cities and razing Aquileia completely, allegedly leaving no trace of it behind. Valentinian III fled from the court at Ravenna to Rome; Aetius remained in the field but lacked the strength to offer battle, instead positioning his army at Bononia to block the roads through the Apennines to Ravenna and Rome.Hughes, Aetius: Attila's Nemesis, 180. Edward Gibbon however says Aetius never showed his greatness more clearly in managing to harass and slow Attila's advance with only a shadow force. Attila finally halted at the Po, where he met an embassy including the prefect Trygetius, the ex-consul Gennadius Avienus, and Pope Leo I. After the meeting he turned his army back, having gained neither Honoria's hand nor the territories he desired. Ancient and medieval historians tended to give Pope Leo and supernatural forces credit for halting Attila,Medieval Sourcebook: Leo I and AttilaGiven, J. (2014) The Fragmentary History of Priscus: Attila, the Huns and the Roman Empire, AD 430-476 Evolution Publishing, Merchantville, NJ , p. 107Paul the Deacon, Historia Romana 14.12 but a number of practical factors may have also induced Attila to retreat: his army was unable to obtain sufficient food and was suffering from disease, Aetius' army was busy harassing the Huns, and finally Marcian had sent forces north of the Danube to attack the homelands of the Huns and their vassals under a separate Aetius.Heather, P. (2010) The Fall of the Roman Empire, Pan Macmillan. , p. 341 = Assassination = Although in 453 Aetius had been able to betroth his son Gaudentius to Valentinian's daughter Placidia, Valentinian felt intimidated by Aetius, who had once supported Joannes against him and who, Valentinian believed, wanted to place his son upon the imperial throne. The Roman senator Petronius Maximus and the chamberlain Heraclius were therefore able to enlist Valentinian in a plot to assassinate Aetius. The ancient historian Priscus of Panium reports that on September 21, 454, while Aetius was at court in Ravenna delivering a financial account, Valentinian suddenly leaped from his seat and declared that he would no longer be the victim of Aetius's drunken depravities. He held Aetius responsible for the empire's troubles and accused him of trying to steal the empire from him. When Aetius attempted to defend himself from the charges, Valentinian drew his sword and together with Heraclius, struck Aetius on the head, killing him instantly.Given, J. The Fragmentary History of Priscus, p. 126 Later, when Valentinian boasted that he had done well in disposing of Aetius, someone at court responded, \\"Whether well or not, I do not know. But know that you have cut off your right hand with your left.\\"Given, J. The Fragmentary History of Priscus, p. 127 Edward Gibbon credits Sidonius Apollinaris with this famous observation.Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ch. 35 Maximus expected to be made patrician in place of Aetius, but was blocked by Heraclius. Seeking revenge, Maximus arranged with two Hunnic friends of Aetius, Optila and Thraustila, to assassinate both Valentinian III and Heraclius. On March 16, 455, Optila stabbed the emperor in the temple as he dismounted in the Campus Martius and prepared for a session of archery practice. As the stunned emperor turned to see who had struck him, Optila finished him off with another thrust of his blade. Meanwhile, Thraustila stepped forward and killed Heraclius. Most of the soldiers standing close by had been faithful followers of Aetius, and none lifted a hand to save the emperor.Given, J. The Fragmentary History of Priscus, p. 128  Legacy  = Military legacy = Aetius is generally viewed as a great military commander ‚Äì indeed, he was held in such high esteem by the Eastern Roman Empire that he became known as the last true Roman of the west. Traditionally, historians also consider the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains as decisively important, crippling Attila by destroying his aura of invincibility.Edward Shepherd Creasy http://www.standin.se/fifteen06a.htm Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World \\"The victory which the Roman general, Aetius, with his Gothic allies, had then gained over the Huns, was the last victory of imperial Rome. But among the long Fasti of her triumphs, few can be found that, for their importance and ultimate benefit to mankind, are comparable with this expiring effort of her arms.\\" Gibbon eloquently states this view: Aetius effectively ruled the western empire from 433 to 454, and attempted to stabilize its European borders under a deluge of barbarians, foremost of which were Attila and the Huns. One of his greatest achievements was the assembling of the coalition against Attila. Regarding this, historian Arther Ferrill states: While J. B. Bury viewed Aetius as a great military commander and a prominent historical figure, he did not consider the battle itself to be particularly decisive. He argues that Aetius attacked the Huns when they were already retreating from Orl√©ans (so the danger to Gaul was departing anyway); and he declined to renew the attack on the Huns next day, precisely in order to preserve the balance of power. (Others suggest that the Huns may have abandoned the siege of Orl√©ans because Aetius's armies were advancing on them.) Bury suggests that the German victory over the Huns at the Battle of Nedao, three years later, was more important. This determined that there would be no long-term Hunnic Empire in Europe, which Bury thinks would have been unlikely even if they had crushed the Germans on that occasion. For Bury, the result of the battle of the Catalaunian Plains determined chiefly that Attila spent his last year looting Italy, rather than Gaul. Modern authors typically overlook the battle and focus on the greater impact of Aetius' career, and he is generally seen as one of the greatest Roman military commanders of all time, as well as an excellent diplomat and administrator. Meghan McEvoy states that the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains is more a testament to his political aptitude than his military skill due to his foresight in the ability to provision treaties and obligations. John Julius Norwich caustically referred to the assassination of Valentinian III by his own guards as an act that Valentinian brought on himself by his foolish execution of Aetius, the \\"Empire's greatest commander.\\"Norwich, John. Byzantium: The Early Centuries Hugh Elton notes that Aetius and his army were one of the most effective Roman armies to have existed, with its speed and mobility pointing to a highly efficient logistical and manpower resupply system not directly evidenced by the sources. It is generally seen that the rapid fragmentation and collapse of the West after his death was a testament to his ability to hold the empire together. = Controversies = Aetius' legacy has been filled with controversy somewhat similar to that of Stilicho as both left the Empire significantly weaker when they died. Like Stilicho's critics pointing towards his inability or unwillingness to deal with usurpation in Britain, Gaul and Spain, and the Rhine crossing of 406, critics of Aetius point towards the civil wars of 427-433 that allowed for the Vandal crossing to Africa and its eventual loss, and Aetius' inability to retake Carthage. Hughes attempts to address this, pointing out that Flavius Constantinus Felix was responsible for the war that allowed for the Vandal crossing, and that the Romans did attempt to deal with it on several occasions, including Bonifatius in 429-432, Aspar in 430-435, and Aetius in 441. Heather states that the rise of Attila ultimately led to the loss of Africa as the Eastern Roman army and navy, which was bearing the brunt of the cost for the expedition, had to be recalled to the Balkans. Halsall argues that the black mark on Aetius' career was his mixed success in Spain, where the majority of the province was lost by 449, although he later rectified this. Hughes states that: Still, the loss of the Empire's tax base in North Africa remains a black mark on his career in the eyes of many modern historians. = Genesis of Arthurian legend = Aetius is generally considered to be the Roman consul to whom the Groans of the Britons was addressed, sometime between 447 and 454 AD. This request for military aid can be viewed as a preamble to the thousand year literary cycle, which evolved the island's legendary Arthurian heritage, the most significant part of what is now collectively referred to as the Matter of Britain. = In popular culture = Aetius is the antagonist in a scenario named \\"Battle of the Catalaunian Fields\\" in the \\"Attila the Hun\\" campaign of the game Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. Aetius is the protagonist of several operas titled Ezio (Italian for Aetius), as he also appears in Verdi's opera Attila. Aetius is protagonist of two biographical novels by polish historical writer Teodor Parnicki: Aecjusz, ostatni Rzymianin (1937, title means Aetius, The Last Roman) and ≈ömierƒá Aecjusza (1966, title means The Death of Aetius). Both novels are ambivalent portraits of Flavius Aetius, and the complicated Roman history during the barbarian invasions of the fifth century. In the 1954 film Attila Aetius is played by Henri Vidal, as an honest soldier reluctantly serving the corrupt Roman court. The character dies in his climactic battle with the Huns. Aetius is played by Powers Boothe in the 2001 American TV Miniseries Attila. Here he is portrayed as an antagonist whose methods are contrasted with Attila, a former mentor and friend to Attila who becomes his nemesis. At the same time, he is depicted as the only general capable of keeping the empire standing and facing Attila as an equal. Aetius is portrayed as the heroic \\"Last of the Romans\\" in William Napier's Attila trilogy (2005), uniting the Romans and the Goths in one final, titanic battle to stop the Huns in their tracks, in the epochal Battle of the Catalaunian Fields. While he does not appear in person, Aetius' battle with Attila is documented in detail in Jack Whyte's book The Eagle, during a conversation between King Arthur and Seur Clothar. Aetius, Galla Placidia and Stilicho all appear as central characters in Jose Gomez-Rivera's historical novel Flavius Aetius: The Last Conqueror, published in 2004. Aetius, Attila and Theodoric all appear in Michael Curtis Ford's fourth novel entitled The Sword of Attila, published by Thomas Dunne Books in 2005. Aetius, Attila, Honoria, Leo and others figure in Louis de Wohl's vivid historical novel Throne of the World (1946), later republished with the alternative title Attila the Hun. Aetius is an important supporting character in Thomas B. Costain's 1959 novel The Darkness and the Dawn, as are Attila and Valentinian III. The novel also includes an account of the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains. The movie 476 A.D. Chapter One: The Last Light of Aries, about the period of Flavius Aetius and his victory over Attila the Hun at the Battle of Ch√¢lons, as well as following the events leading to the End of the Roman Empire on September 4, 476 A.D, was released in 2014, by Ivan Pavletic. Aetius is portrayed by Michael Nardone in the final episode of the 2016 History Channel docudrama Barbarians Rising, set during the campaign against the Huns.

A studious man of retiring personality, he was intensely self-critical, having abandoned and destroyed many of his compositions. His best-known work is the orchestral piece The Sorcerer's Apprentice (L'apprenti sorcier), the fame of which has eclipsed that of his other surviving works. Among these are the opera Ariane et Barbe-bleue, his Symphony in C and Piano Sonata in E-flat minor, the Variations, Interlude and Finale on a Theme by Rameau (for solo piano), and a ballet, La P√©ri. At a time when French musicians were divided into conservative and progressive factions, Dukas adhered to neither but retained the admiration of both. His compositions were influenced by composers including Beethoven, Berlioz, Franck, d'Indy and Debussy. In tandem with his composing career, Dukas worked as a music critic, contributing regular reviews to at least five French journals. Later in his life he was appointed professor of composition at the Conservatoire de Paris and the √âcole Normale de Musique; his pupils included Maurice Durufl√©, Olivier Messiaen, Manuel Ponce, and Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo. Life and career =Early years= Dukas's teachers, Georges Mathias (top l.), Th√©odore Dubois (top r.) and Ernest Guiraud (bottom l.), and Dukas's fellow student Claude Debussy Dukas was born in Paris, the second son in a Jewish family of three children.Lockspeiser, p. 89 His father, Jules Dukas, was a banker, and his mother, Eug√©nie, was a capable pianist.Havard de la Montagne, Denis. \\"Paul Dukas\\", Musica et Memoria (French text), accessed 18 March 2011 When Dukas was five years old, his mother died giving birth to her third child, Marguerite- Lucie. Dukas took piano lessons but showed no unusual musical talent until he was 14 when he began to compose while recovering from an illness.Schwartz, Manuela and G.W. Hopkins. \\"Dukas, Paul.\\" Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 March 2011 He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at the end of 1881, aged 16, and studied piano with Georges Mathias, harmony with Th√©odore Dubois and composition with Ernest Guiraud.Schwerk√©, Irving. \\"Paul Dukas: A Brief Appreciation\\", The Musical Quarterly, July 1928, pp. 403‚Äì412, accessed 17 March 2011 Among his fellow students was Claude Debussy, with whom Dukas formed a close friendship. Two early overtures survive from this period, Goetz de Berlichingen (1883) and Le Roi Lear (1883). The manuscript of the latter was rediscovered in the 1990s and the work was performed for the first time in 1995. Dukas won several prizes, including the second place in the Conservatoire's most prestigious award, the Prix de Rome, for his cantata Vell√©da in 1888. Disappointed at his failure to win the top prize, he left the Conservatoire in 1889.\\"Paul Dukas\\", The Musical Times, July 1935, pp. 655‚Äì656, accessed 17 March 2011 After compulsory military service he began a dual career as a composer and a music critic. =1890s= Dukas's career as a critic began in 1892 with a review of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen conducted by Gustav Mahler at Covent Garden in London. His review was published in La Revue Hebdomadaire; he later wrote also for Minerva, La Chronique des Arts, Gazette des Beaux-Arts and Le Courrier Musical. His Parisian debut as composer was a performance of his overture Polyeucte, written in 1891 and premiered by Charles Lamoureux and his Orchestre Lamoureux in January 1892. Based on a tragedy by Corneille, the work, like many French works of the period, shows the influence of Wagner, but is coherent and displays some individuality. Gazette des Beaux-Arts, for which Dukas wrote music criticism Although Dukas wrote a fair amount of music, he was a perfectionist and destroyed many of his pieces out of dissatisfaction with them. Only a few of his compositions remain. After Polyeucte, he began writing an opera in 1892. He wrote his own libretto, Horn et Riemenhild, but he composed only one act, \\"realising too late that the work's developments were more literary than musical\\".Dukas, quoted in Grove The Symphony in C major was composed in 1895‚Äì96, when Dukas was in his early 30s. It is dedicated to Paul Vidal, and had its first performance in January 1896, under the direction of the dedicatee. In a study of Dukas published towards the end of the composer's life, Irving Schwerk√© wrote, \\"The work ‚Ä¶ is an opulent expression of modernism in classical form. Its ideational luxuriance, nobility of utterance and architectural solidity mark it as one of the most conspicuous achievements of contemporaneous writing, and magnificently refute the generally prevalent notion that no French composer has ever produced a great symphony.\\" Like Franck's only symphony, Dukas's is in three movements rather than the conventional four. Schwerk√© wrote of it: The work received a mixed reception at its first performance. D√©sir√©-√âmile Inghelbrecht, later known as a conductor, was a member of the orchestra at the premiere, and wrote, \\"the work which nowadays seems to us so lucid aroused not only the protestations of the public, but also those of the musicians of the orchestra.\\"Langham Smith, Richard (1994). Notes to Chandos CD 209225 The symphony was better received when the Lamoureux Orchestra revived it in 1902. The symphony was followed by another orchestral work, by far the best known of Dukas's compositions, his scherzo for orchestra, L'apprenti sorcier (The Sorcerer's Apprentice) (1897), a short piece (lasting for between 10 and 12 minutes in performance)Indicative timings: 10 minutes 04 seconds on HMV LP 1432 (NBC Symphony Orchestra and Arturo Toscanini, 1957); 10' 44\\" on DG CD 419 617-2 (Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and James Levine, 1987); 11' 31\\" on Chandos CD CHAN 241-32 (Ulster Orchestra and Yan Pascal Tortelier, 1989); and 11' 33\\" on Decca CD 421 527-2 Montreal Symphony Orchestra and Charles Dutoit, 1989 based on Goethe's poem \\"Der Zauberlehrling\\". During Dukas's lifetime The Musical Quarterly commented that the world fame of the work not only overshadowed all other compositions by Dukas, but also eclipsed Goethe's original poem. The popularity of the piece became a matter of irritation to Dukas. In 2011, the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians observed, \\"The popularity of L'apprenti sorcier and the exhilarating film version of it in Disney's Fantasia possibly hindered a fuller understanding of Dukas, as that single work is far better known than its composer.\\" =20th century works= Costume design for Dukas's La P√©ri by L√©on Bakst, 1922. In the decade after L'apprenti sorcier, Dukas completed two complex and technically demanding large-scale works for solo piano: the Piano Sonata (1901), dedicated to Saint-Sa√´ns, and Variations, Interlude and Finale on a Theme by Rameau (1902). In Dukas's piano works critics have discerned the influence of Beethoven, or, \\"Beethoven as he was interpreted to the French mind by C√©sar Franck\\". Both works were premiered by √âdouard Risler, a celebrated pianist of the era.Lockspeiser, p. 90 There are also two smaller works for piano solo. The Sonata, described by the critic Edward Lockspeiser as \\"huge and somewhat recondite\\",Lockspeiser, p. 92 did not enter the mainstream repertoire, but it has been more recently championed by such pianists as Marc-Andr√© Hamelin and Margaret Fingerhut.Nicholas, Jeremy. \\"Dukas\\", Gramophone, July 2006, p. 74, accessed 18 March 2011Chandos CD 8765 (1988) Lockspeiser describes the Rameau Variations as more developed and assured ... Dukas infuses the conventional form with a new and powerful spirit.\\" In 1899 Dukas turned once again to operatic composition. His second attempt, L'arbre de science, was abandoned, incomplete, but in the same year he began work on his one completed opera, Ariane et Barbe-bleue (Ariadne and Bluebeard). The work is a setting of a libretto by Maurice Maeterlinck.Arnold, Denis and Richard Langham Smith. \\"Dukas, Paul (Abraham).\\" The Oxford Companion to Music. Ed. Alison Latham, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 March 2011 The author had intended the libretto to be set by Grieg but in 1899 he offered it to Dukas. Dukas worked on it for seven years and it was produced at the Op√©ra- Comique in 1907. The opera has often been compared to Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande which was first performed while Dukas was writing Ariane et Barbe- bleue. Not only are both works settings of Maeterlinck, but there are musical similarities; Dukas even quotes from the Debussy work in his score. Although it won considerable praise, its success was overshadowed by the Paris premiere of Richard Strauss's sensational opera Salome at much the same time. Nonetheless, within a short time of its premiere, Dukas's opera was produced in Vienna, where it aroused much interest in Schoenberg's circle, and in Frankfurt, Milan and New York. It did not maintain a regular place in the repertory, despite the advocacy of Arturo Toscanini, who conducted it in New York three years in succession,Taubman, Howard. \\"Toscanini in America\\", The Musical Quarterly, April 1947, pp. 178‚Äì187 and Sir Thomas Beecham, who pronounced it \\"one of the finest lyrical dramas of our time,\\"Lockspeiser, p. 91 and staged it at Covent Garden in 1937.Jefferson, p. 184 Interest in it revived in the 1990s, with productions in Paris (Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, 1990) and Hamburg (Staatsoper, 1997), and at the Op√©ra Bastille in Paris in 2007.\\" Ariane et Barbe-Bleue\\", Evene, accessed 18 March 2011 Dukas's last major work was the sumptuous oriental ballet La P√©ri (1912). Described by the composer as a \\"po√®me dans√©\\" it depicts a young Persian prince who travels to the ends of the Earth in a quest to find the lotus flower of immortality, coming across its guardian, the P√©ri (fairy).Blakeman, Edward (1990). Notes to Chandos CD 208852, p. 5 Because of the very quiet opening pages of the ballet score, the composer added a brief \\"Fanfare pour pr√©c√©der La Peri\\" which gave the typically noisy audiences of the day time to settle in their seats before the work proper began. La P√©ri was written for the Russian-French dancer Natalia Trouhanova, who starred in the first performance at the Ch√¢telet in 1912. Diaghilev planned a production with his Ballets Russes but the production did not take place; the company's choreographer Fokine staged L'apprenti sorcier as a ballet in 1916. In 1916, Dukas married Suzanne Pereyra (1883-1947), who was of Portuguese descent. They had one child, a daughter Adrienne-Th√©r√®se, born in December 1919. =Later years= Paul Dukas and students of his composition class at the Paris Conservatoire, 1929. Olivier Messiaen is on the extreme right; Maurice Durufl√© stands next to him In the last years of his life, Dukas became well known as a teacher of composition. When Charles-Marie Widor retired as professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1927, Dukas was appointed in his place. He also taught at the √âcole Normale de Musique in Paris. His many students included Jehan Alain, Elsa Barraine, Yvonne Desportes, Francis Chagrin, Carlos Ch√°vez, Maurice Durufl√©, Georges Hugon, Jean Langlais, Olivier Messiaen, Manuel Ponce, Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo, David Van Vactor and Xian Xinghai.\\"Francis Chagrin\\", Chester Novello, accessed 19 March 2011 As a teacher he was conservative but always encouraging of talent, telling one student, \\"It's obvious that you really love music. Always remember that it should be written from the heart and not with the head.\\" He said his method of teaching was \\"to help young musicians to express themselves in accordance with their own natures. Music necessarily has to express something; it is also obliged to express somebody, namely, its composer.\\" Grove observes that his wide knowledge of the history of European music, and his editorial work on Rameau, Scarlatti and Beethoven, gave him \\"particular authority in teaching historical styles\\". After La P√©ri, Dukas completed no new large-scale compositions, although, as with his contemporary Jean Sibelius, there were frequent reports of major work in hand.Walsh, p. 110 After several years of silence, in 1920 he produced a tribute to his friend Debussy in the form of La plainte, au loin, du faune... for piano, which was followed by Amours, a setting of a sonnet by Pierre de Ronsard, for voice and piano, published in 1924 to mark the four hundredth anniversary of the poet's birth. Shortly before his death he had been working on a symphonic poem inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest, a play of which he had made a French translation in 1918 with an operatic version in mind. In the last year of his life Dukas was elected to membership of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. Though adhering to neither the progressive nor conservative factions among French musicians of the era, Dukas had the friendship and respect of both. In 1920, Vincent d'Indy published a study of Dukas's music; Debussy remained a lifelong friend, though feeling that Dukas's music was not French enough; Saint-Sa√´ns worked with Dukas to complete an unfinished opera by Guiraud, and they were both engaged in the rediscovery and editing of the works of Jean-Philippe Rameau; Faur√© dedicated his Second Piano Quintet to Dukas in 1921.Jones, p. 207 In 1920, he became a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.Index biographique des membres et associ√©s de l'Acad√©mie royale de Belgique (1769-2005). p 104 Dukas died in Paris in 1935, aged 69. He was cremated and his ashes were placed in the columbarium at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.Cimeti√®re du P√®re Lachaise.

With an assurance characteristic of the later sophists, he claimed to be regarded as an authority on all subjects, and lectured on poetry, grammar, history, politics, mathematics, and much else. Most of our knowledge of him is derived from Plato, who characterizes him as vain and arrogant. Life Hippias was born at Elis in the mid 5th-century BC (c. 460 BC) and was thus a younger contemporary of Protagoras and Socrates. He lived at least as late as Socrates (399 BC). He was a disciple of Hegesidamus.Suda, Hippias Owing to his talent and skill, his fellow-citizens availed themselves of his services in political matters, and in a diplomatic mission to Sparta.Plato, Hippias major, 281a, 286a; Philostratus, Vit. Soph. i. 11. But he was in every respect like the other sophists of the time: he travelled about in various towns and districts of Greece for the purpose of teaching and public speaking. The two dialogues of Plato, the Hippias major and the Hippias minor characterize him as vain and arrogant. The Hippias major (the authorship of this work by Plato is sometimes doubted) concerns the question about the beautiful, and purposely puts the knowledge and presumption of Hippias in a ludicrous light. The Hippias minor discusses the deficiency of our knowledge, and characterizes Hippias as ridiculously vain. Work Hippias was a man of very extensive knowledge, and he occupied himself not only with rhetorical, philosophical, and political studies, but was also well versed in poetry, music, mathematics, painting and sculpture, and he claimed some practical skill in the ordinary arts of life, for he used to boast of wearing on his body nothing that he had not made himself with his own hands, such as his seal-ring, his cloak, and shoes.Plato, Hippias major, 285c, Hippias minor, 368b, Protagoras, 315c; Philostratus, Vit. Soph. i. 11.; Themistius, Orat. xxix. p. 345. d. On the other hand, his knowledge always appears superficial, he does not enter into the details of any particular art or science, and is satisfied with certain generalities, which enabled him to speak on everything without a thorough knowledge of any. This arrogance, combined with ignorance, is the main cause which provoked Plato to his severe criticism of Hippias, as the sophist enjoyed a very extensive reputation, and thus had a large influence upon the education of the youths of the higher classes. A mathematical discovery ascribed to Hippias is sometimes called the quadratrix of Hippias. His great skill seems to have consisted in delivering grand show speeches; and Plato has him arrogantly declaring that he would travel to Olympia, and there deliver before the assembled Greeks an oration on any subject that might be proposed to him;Plat. Hippias minor, 363 and Philostratus in fact speaks of several such orations delivered at Olympia, and which created great sensation. If such speeches were published by Hippias, then no specimen has come down to us. Plato claims he wrote epic poetry, tragedies, dithyrambs, and various orations,Plato Hippias minor, 368 as well works on as grammar, music, rhythm, harmony, and a variety of other subjects.Plato, Hippias major, 285ff; comp. Philostratus, Vit. Soph. i. 11.; Plutarch, Num. 1, 23; Dio Chrysostom, Orat. lxxi. He seems to have been especially fond of choosing antiquarian and mythical subjects for his show speeches. Athenaeus mentions a work of Hippias under the title Synagoge which is otherwise unknown.Athenaeus, xiii. 609 An epigram of his is preserved in Pausanias.Pausanias, v. 25 Natural law Hippias is credited with originating the idea of natural law. This ideal began at first during the fifth century B.C. According to Hippias, natural law was never to be superseded as it was universal. Hippias saw natural law as a habitual entity that humans take part in without pre-meditation. He regarded the elite in states as indistinguishable from one another and thus they should perceive each other as so. Because of this they should consider and treat each other as a society of a unanimous state. These ideas were passed on through Cynicism and Stoicism later being the foundation for turning Roman law in legislation. Along with natural law, Hippias also wrote about self-sufficiency as a binding principle. He used this principle in his teachings as he gathered knowledge in numerous subjects so as to be never outwitted or have his reputation questioned.

Merriam-Webster Dictionary Historically, reed pens, quill pens, and dip pens were used, with a nib dipped in ink. Ruling pens allow precise adjustment of line width, and still find a few specialized uses, but technical pens such as the Rapidograph are more commonly used. Modern types include ballpoint, rollerball, fountain and felt or ceramic tip pens.\\"pen.\\" Word Histories and Mysteries. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004. Credo Reference. Web. 13 September 2007. Types =Modern= The main modern types of pens can be categorized by the kind of writing tip or point on the pen: An inexpensive ballpoint pen * A ballpoint pen dispenses an oil-based ink by rolling a small hard sphere, usually 0.5‚Äì1.2 mm and made of brass, steel, or tungsten carbide. The ink dries almost immediately on contact with paper. The ballpoint pen is usually reliable and comes in both inexpensive and expensive types. It has replaced the fountain pen as the most common tool for everyday writing. (There are certain ballpoint pens combining multiple colours in a single barrel; the writer or artist may depress the tip with the desired colour.) A Luxury ballpoint pen * A rollerball pen dispenses a water-based liquid or gel ink through a ball tip similar to that of a ballpoint pen. The less-viscous ink is more easily absorbed by paper than oil- based ink, and the pen moves more easily across a writing surface. The rollerball pen was initially designed to combine the convenience of a ballpoint pen with the smooth \\"wet ink\\" effect of a fountain pen. Gel inks are available in a range of colors, including metallic paint colors, glitter effects, neon, blurred effects, saturated colors, pastel tones, vibrant shades, shady colors, invisible ink, see-through effect, shiny colors, and glow-in-the-dark effects. Refillable rollerball pens have recently become available using cartridges of fountain pen ink. * A fountain pen uses water- based liquid ink delivered through a nib. The ink flows from a reservoir through a \\"feed\\" to the nib, then through the nib, due to capillary action and gravity. The nib has no moving parts and delivers ink through a thin slit to the writing surface. A fountain pen reservoir can be refillable or disposable; the disposable type is called an ink cartridge. A pen with a refillable reservoir may have a mechanism, such as a piston, to draw ink from a bottle through the nib, or it may require refilling with an eyedropper. Refill reservoirs, also known as cartridge converters, are available for some pens which use disposable cartridges. A fountain pen can be used with permanent or non-permanent inks. * A felt-tip pen, or marker, has a porous tip of fibrous material. The smallest, finest-tipped felt-tip pens are used for writing on paper. Medium-tipped felt-tips are often used by children for coloring and drawing. Larger types, often called \\"markers\\", are used for writing in larger sizes, often on other surfaces such as corrugated boxes, whiteboards and for chalkboards, often called \\"liquid chalk\\" or \\"chalkboard markers\\". Markers with wide tips and bright but transparent ink, called highlighters, are used to highlight text that has already been written or printed. Pens designed for children or for temporary writing (as with a whiteboard or overhead projector) typically use non-permanent inks. Large markers used to label shipping cases or other packages are usually permanent markers. * A gel pen uses ink in which pigment is suspended in a water-based gel. Because the ink is thick and opaque, it shows up more clearly on dark or slick surfaces than the typical inks used in ballpoint or felt tip pens. Gel pens can be used for many types of writing and illustration. Gel pens often come in bright or neon colors. * A stylus pen, plural styli or styluses, is a writing utensil or a small tool for some other form of marking or shaping, for example, in pottery. It can also be a computer accessory that is used to assist in navigating or providing more precision when using touchscreens. It usually refers to a narrow elongated staff, similar to a modern ballpoint pen. Pens exist which contain a ballpoint tip on one end and this sort of touchscreen stylus on the other. = Historic = These historic types of pens are no longer in common use as writing instruments, but may be used by calligraphers and other artists: A dip pen * A dip pen (or nib pen) consists of a metal nib with capillary channels, like that of a fountain pen, mounted on a handle or holder, often made of wood. A dip pen usually has no ink reservoir and must be repeatedly recharged with ink while drawing or writing. The dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof pigmented (particle-and-binder-based) inks, such as so-called India ink, drawing ink, or acrylic inks, which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging, as well as the traditional iron gall ink, which can cause corrosion in a fountain pen. Dip pens are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics. A particularly fine-pointed type of dip pen known as a crowquill is a favorite instrument of artists, such as David Stone Martin and Jay Lynch, because its flexible metal point can create a variety of delicate lines, textures and tones with slight pressures while drawing. * The ink brush is the traditional writing implement in East Asian calligraphy. The body of the brush can be made from either bamboo, or rarer materials such as red sandalwood, glass, ivory, silver, and gold. The head of the brush can be made from the hair (or feathers) of a wide variety of animals, including the weasel, rabbit, deer, chicken, duck, goat, pig, tiger, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir for the child. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the Imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm. Today, calligraphy may also be done using a pen, but pen calligraphy does not enjoy the same prestige as traditional brush calligraphy. * A quill is a pen made from a flight feather of a large bird, most often a goose. Quills were used as instruments for writing with ink before the metal dip pen, the fountain pen, and eventually the ballpoint pen came into use. Quill pens were used in medieval times to write on parchment or paper. The quill eventually replaced the reed pen. * A reed pen is cut from a reed or bamboo, with a slit in a narrow tip. Its mechanism is essentially similar to that of a quill. The reed pen has almost disappeared but it is still used by young school students in some parts of India and Pakistan, who learn to write with them on small timber boards known as \\"Takhti\\". History M. Klein and Henry W. Wynne received US patent#68445 in 1867 for an ink chamber and delivery system in the handle of the fountain pen. Ancient Egyptians had developed writing on papyrus scrolls when scribes used thin reed brushes or reed pens from the Juncus maritimus or sea rush.Egyptian reed pen Retrieved March 16, 2007. In his book A History of Writing, Steven Roger Fischer suggests that on the basis of finds at Saqqara, the reed pen might well have been used for writing on parchment as long ago as the First Dynasty or about 3000 BC. Reed pens continued to be used until the Middle Ages, but were slowly replaced by quills from about the 7th century. The reed pen, generally made from bamboo, is still used in some parts of Pakistan by young students and is used to write on small wooden boards.Historic pens The reed pen survived until papyrus was replaced as a writing surface by animal skins, vellum and parchment. The smoother surface of skin allowed finer, smaller writing with a quill pen, derived from the flight feather.\\"pen.\\" The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather guide.

It also claims the pens have 'well-tempered Elasticity' and that the 'Steel Points' are treated to be rustproof, rust being 'a circumstance that has been long and universally complained of in this article'. A metal pen point was patented in 1803, but the patent was not commercially exploited. A patent for the manufacture of metal pens was advertised for sale by Bryan Donkin in 1811.He offered the patent, which had an unexpired term of 11 years, for sale together with the 'utensils peculiarly adapted to the manufacturing' of the metal pens: John Mitchell of Birmingham started to mass-produce pens with metal nibs in 1822, and after that, the quality of steel nibs improved enough so that dip pens with metal nibs came into general use.In 1832 a woman accused of stealing a silver pen from a London shop said in her defence that she had 'one of the common metal pens' with her: Deliciae physico-mathematicae, 1636 The earliest historical record of a pen with a reservoir dates back to the 10th century AD. In 953, Ma'ƒÅd al-Mu'izz, the Fatimid Caliph of Egypt, demanded a pen which would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen which held ink in a reservoir and delivered it to the nib. This pen may have been a fountain pen, but its mechanism remains unknown, and only one record mentioning it has been found. A later reservoir pen was developed in 1636. In his Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae (1636), German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point. In 1809, Bartholomew Folsch received a patent in England for a pen with an ink reservoir. While a student in Paris, Romanian Petrache Poenaru invented the fountain pen, which the French Government patented in May 1827. Fountain pen patents and production then increased in the 1850s.

Today, the city is small (about 3,500 inhabitants), but it was large and prominent in classical antiquity as one of the world's largest cities with a population of 100,000 in the 2nd century AD. and is one of the main archaeological sites of northern Italy. In late antiquity the city was the first city in the Italian Peninsula to be sacked by Attila the Hun. History = Classical Antiquity = A view of the archaeological area of Aquileia. Roman Republic Aquileia was founded as a colony by the Romans in 180/181 BC along the Natiso River, on land south of the Julian Alps but about north of the lagoons. The colony served as a strategic frontier fortress at the north-east corner of transpadane Italy (on the far side of the Po river) and was intended to protect the Veneti, faithful allies of Rome during the invasion of Hannibal in the Second Punic War and during the Illyrian Wars. The colony would serve as a citadel to check the advance into Cisalpine Gaul of other warlike peoples, such as the hostile Carni to the northeast in what is now Carnia and Histri tribes to the southeast in what is now Istria. In fact, the site chosen for Aquileia was about 6 km from where an estimated 12,000 Celtic Taurisci nomads had attempted to settle in 183 BC. However, since the 13th century BC, the site, on the river and at the head of the Adriatic, had also been of commercial importance as the end of the Baltic amber (sucinum) trade. It is, therefore, theoretically not unlikely that Aquileia had been a Gallic oppidum even before the coming of the Romans. However, few Celtic artefacts have been discovered from 500 BC to the Roman arrival.G. Bandelli, \\"Aquileia dalla fondazione al II secolo d.C\\" in Aquileia dalla fondazione al alto medioevo, M. Buora, ed. (Udine: Arte Grafiche Friulane, 1982), 20. The colony was established with Latin Rights by the triumvirate of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, Caius Flaminius, and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, two of whom were of consular and one of praetorian rank. Each of the men had first hand knowledge of Cisalpine Gaul. Nasica had conquered the Boii in 191. Flaminius had overseen the construction of the road named after him from Bononia (Bologna) to Arretium (Arezzo). Acidinus had conquered the Taurisci in 183.Livy, XL, 34, 2-4.E. Mangani, F. Rebecchi, and M.J. Srazzulla, Emilia Venezie (Bari: Laterza & Figli, 1981), 210. The triumvirate led 3,000 families to settle the area meaning Aquileia probably had a population of 20,000 soon after its founding. Meanwhile, based on the evidence of names chiselled on stone, the majority of colonizing families came from Picenum, Samnium, and Campania, which also explains why the colony was Latin and not Roman. Among these colonists, pedites received 50 iugera of land each, centuriones received 100 iugera each, and equites received 140 iugera each. Either at the founding or not long afterwards, colonists from the nearby Veneti supplemented these families. Roads soon connected Aquileia with the Roman colony of Bologna probably in 173 BC. In 148 BC, it was connected with Genua by the Via Postumia, which stretched across the Padanian plain from Aquileia through or near to Opitergium, Tarvisium, Vicetia, Verona, Bedriacum, and the three Roman colonies of Cremona, Placentia, and Dertona. The construction of the Via Popilia from the Roman colony of Ariminium to Ad Portum near Altinum in 132 BC improved communications still further. In the 1st century AD, the Via Gemina would link Aquileia with Emona to the east of the Julian Alps, and by 78 or 79 AD the Via Flavia would link Aquileia to Pula. Meanwhile, in 169 BC, 1,500 more Latin colonists with their families, led by the triumvirate of Titus Annius Lucius, Publius Decius Subulo, and Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, settled in the town as a reinforcement to the garrison.Livy XLIII 17,1 The discovery of the gold fields near the modern Klagenfurt in 130 BCStrabo IV. 208 brought the growing colony into further notice, and it soon became a place of importance, not only owing to its strategic military position, but as a centre of commerce, especially in agricultural products and viticulture. It also had, in later times at least, considerable brickfields. In 90 BC, the original Latin colony became a municipium and its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe Velina. The customs boundary of Italy was close by in Cicero's day. Julius Caesar visited the city on a number of occasions and pitched winter camp nearby in 59‚Äì58 BC.  Roman Empire  Although the Iapydes plundered Aquileia during the Augustan period, subsequent increased settlement and no lack of profitable work meant the city was able to develop its resources. Jewish artisans established a flourishing trade in glass-work. Metal from Noricum was forged and exported. The ancient Venetic trade in amber from the Baltic continued. Wine, especially its famous Pucinum was exported. Olive oil was imported from Proconsular Africa. By sea, the port of Aquae Gradatae (modern Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia) was developed. On land, Aquileia was the starting-point of several important roads leading outside Italy to the north- eastern portion of the empire ‚Äî the road (Via Julia Augusta) by Iulium Carnicum (Zuglio) to Veldidena (mod. Wilten, near Innsbruck), from which branched off the road into Noricum, leading by Virunum (Klagenfurt) to Laurieum (Lorch) on the Danube, the road leading via Emona into Pannonia and to Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica), the road to Tarsatica (near Fiume, now Rijeka) and Siscia (Sisak), and the road to Tergeste (Trieste) and the Istrian coast. Augustus was the first of a number of emperors to visit Aquileia, notably during the Pannonian wars in 12‚Äì10 BC. It was the birthplace of Tiberius' son by Julia, in the latter year. The Roman poet Martial praised Aquileia as his hoped for haven and resting place in his old age.Martial, Epigrams lib. 4, 25: Aemula Baianis Altini litora villis et Phaethontei conscia silva rogi, quaeque Antenoreo Dryadum pulcherrima Fauno nupsit ad Euganeos Sola puella lacus, et tu Ledaeo felix Aquileia Timauo, hic ubi septenas Cyllarus hausit aquas: uos eritis nostrae requies portusque senectae, si iuris fuerint otia nostra sui. http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/martial/mart4.shtml In terms of religion, the populace adopted the Roman pantheon, although the Celtic sun-god, Belenus, had a large following. Jews practised their ancestral religion and it was perhaps some of these Jews who became the first Christians. Meanwhile, soldiers brought the martial cult of Mithras. The ancient inland port of Aquileia In the war against the Marcomanni in 167, the town was hard pressed; its fortifications had fallen into disrepair during the long peace. Nevertheless, when in 168 Marcus Aurelius made Aquileia the principal fortress of the empire against the barbarians of the North and East, it rose to the pinnacle of its greatness and soon had a population of 100,000. Septimius Severus visited in 193. In 238, when the town took the side of the Senate against the emperor Maximinus Thrax, the fortifications were hastily restored, and proved of sufficient strength to resist for several months, until Maximinus himself was assassinated. = Late Antiquity = An imperial palace was constructed in Aquileia, in which the emperors after the time of Diocletian frequently resided. Roman Emperor Flavius Victor on this as struck in Aquileia mint. During the 4th century, Aquileia maintained its importance. Constantine sojourned there on numerous occasions. It became a naval station and the seat of the Corrector Venetiarum et Histriae; a mint was established, of which the coins were very numerous, and the bishop obtained the rank of metropolitan archbishop. A council held in the city in 381 was only the first of a series of Councils of Aquileia that have been convened over the centuries. However, the city played a part in the struggles between the rulers of the 4th century. In 340, the emperor Constantine II was killed nearby while invading the territory of his younger brother Constans.Aquileia in a 1493 woodcut from Hartmann Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle At the end of the 4th century, Ausonius enumerated Aquileia as the ninth among the great cities of the world, placing Rome, Constantinople, Carthage, Antioch, Alexandria, Trier, Mediolanum, and Capua before it. However, such prominence made it a target and Alaric and the Visigoths besieged it in 401, during which time some of its residents fled to the nearby lagoons. Alaric again attacked it in 408. Attila attacked the city in 452. During this invasion, on July 18, Attila and his Huns so utterly destroyed the city that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site. The fall of Aquileia was the first of Attila's incursions into Roman territory; followed by cities like Mediolanum and Ticinum. The Roman inhabitants, together with those of smaller towns in the neighbourhood, fled en masse to the lagoons, and so laid the foundations of the cities of Venice and nearby Grado. Yet Aquileia would rise again, though much diminished, and continue to exist until the Lombards invaded in 568; the Lombards destroyed it a second time in 590. Meanwhile, the patriarch fled to the island town of Grado, which was under the protection of the Byzantines. When the patriarch residing in Grado reconciled with Rome in 606, those continuing in the Schism of the Three Chapters, rejecting the Second Council of Constantinople, elected a patriarch at Aquileia. Thus, the diocese was essentially divided into two parts, with the mainland patriarchate of Aquileia under the protection of the Lombards, and the insular patriarchate of Aquileia seated in Grado being protected by the exarchate of Ravenna and later the Doges of Venice, with the collusion of the Lombards. The line of the patriarchs elected in Aquileia would continue in schism until 699 CE. However, although they kept the title of patriarch of Aquileia, they moved their residence first to Cormons and later to Cividale. = Middle Ages = The Lombard dukes of Friuli ruled Aquileia and the surrounding mainland territory from Cividale. In 774, Charlemagne conquered the Lombard duchy and made it into a Frankish one with Eric of Friuli as duke. In 787, Charlemagne named the priest and master of grammar at the Palace School of Paulinus II, the new patriarch of Aquileia. The patriarchate, despite being divided with a northern portion assigned to the pastoral care of the newly created Archbishopric of Salzburg, would remain one of the largest dioceses. Although Paulinus resided mainly at Cividale, his successor Maxentius considered rebuilding Aquileia. However, the project never came to fruition. While Maxentius was patriarch, the pope approved the Synod of Mantua, which affirmed the precedence of the mainland patriarch of Aquileia over the patriarch of Grado. However, material conditions were soon to worsen for Aquileia. The ruins of Aquileia were continually pillaged for building material. And with the collapse of the Carolingians in the 10th century, the inhabitants would suffer under the raids of the Magyars. By the 11th century, the patriarch of Aquileia had grown strong enough to assert temporal sovereignty over Friuli and Aquileia. The Holy Roman Emperor gave the region to the patriarch as a feudal possession. However, the patriarch's temporal authority was constantly disputed and assailed by the territorial nobility. In 1027 and 1044 Patriarch Poppo of Aquileia, who rebuilt the cathedral of Aquileia, entered and sacked neighbouring Grado, and, though the Pope reconfirmed the Patriarch of the latter in his dignities, the town never fully recovered, though it continued to be the seat of the Patriarchate until its formal transference to Venice in 1450. In the 14th century the Patriarchal State reached its largest extension, stretching from the Piave river to the Julian Alps and northern Istria. The seat of the Patriarchate of Aquileia had been transferred to Udine in 1238, but returned to Aquiliea in 1420 when Venice annexed the territory of Udine. In 1445, the defeated patriarch Ludovico Trevisan acquiesced in the loss of his ancient temporal estate in return for an annual salary of 5,000 ducats allowed him from the Venetian treasury. Henceforth only Venetians were allowed to hold the title of Patriarch of Aquileia. The Patriarchal State was incorporated in the Republic of Venice with the name of Patria del Friuli, ruled by a provveditore generale or a luogotenente living in Udine. The Patriarchal diocese was only finally officially suppressed in 1751, and the sees of Udine and Gorizia established from its territory. Interior of the Cathedral, with the mosaic pavement. Ancient mosaic in the Cathedral. The archaeological walk. Main sights =Cathedral= The Aquileia Cathedral is a flat-roofed basilica erected by Patriarch Poppo in 1031 on the site of an earlier church, and rebuilt about 1379 in the Gothic style by Patriarch Marquard of Randeck. The fa√ßade, in Romanesque-Gothic style, is connected by a portico to the so-called Church of the Pagans, and the remains of the 5th-century baptistery. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a noteworthy mosaic pavement from the 4th century. The wooden ceiling is from 1526, while the fresco decoration belongs to various ages: from the 4th century in the St. Peter's chapel of the apse area; from the 11th century in the apse itself; from the 12th century in the so- called \\"Crypt of the Frescoes\\", under the presbytery, with a cycle depicting the origins of Christianity in Aquileia and the history of St. Hermagoras, first bishop of the city. Next to the 11th-century Romanesque chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, at the beginning of the left aisle, flooring of different ages can be seen: the lowest is from a Roman villa of the age of Augustus; the middle one has a typical cocciopesto pavement; the upper one, bearing blackening from Attila's fire, has geometrical decorations. Externally, behind the 9th-century campanile and the apse, is the Cemetery of the Fallen, where ten unnamed soldiers of World War I are buried. Saint Hermagoras is also buried there. =Ancient Roman Remains= Today, Aquileia is a town smaller than the colony first founded by Rome. Over the centuries, sieges, earthquakes, floods, and pillaging of the ancient buildings for materials means that no edifices of the Roman period remain above ground. The site of Aquileia, believed to be the largest Roman city yet to be excavated, is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Excavations, however, have revealed some of the layout of the Roman town such as a segment of a street, the north-west angle of the town walls, the river port, and the former locations of baths, of an amphitheatre, of a Circus, of a cemetery, of the Via Sacra, of the forum, and of a market. The National Archaeological Museum contains over 2,000 inscriptions, statues and other antiquities, mosaics, as well as glasses of local production and a numismatics collection. =Others= In the Monastero fraction is a 5th-century Christian basilica, later a Benedictine monastery, which today houses the Palaeo-Christian Museum.

They occupied the interior of the country between the Colapis (Kupa) and Oeneus (Una) rivers, and the Velebit mountain range (Mons Baebius) which separated them from the coastal Liburnians. Their territory covered the central inlands of modern Croatia and Una River Valley in today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. Archaeological documentation confirms their presence in these countries at least from 9th century BC, and they persisted in their area longer than a millennium. The ancient written documentation on inland Iapydes is scarcer than on the adjacent coastal peoples (Liburni, Delmatae, etc.) that had more frequent maritime contacts with ancient Greeks and Romans. The Iapydes had their maximal development and territorial expansion from the 8th to 4th centuries BC. They settled mostly in inland mountain valleys between Pannonia and the coastal Adriatic basin, but in disputation with southern Liburni they periodically reached also the northern Adriatic coast at Vinodol valley (classical Valdevinum).

A major scholar of the Japodi was archaeologist Branka Raunig. Iapodes territory in cca 5th century BC Origin and affinity Japodi ceramics and metalwork The exact origin of early Iapydes is uncertain; archaeological documentation suggests mixed affinities to early Pannonii and Illyrians. The first written mention of an Illyrian tribe is from Greek writers from the 6th century BC. They are provisionally described by Strabo as a mixed race of Celts and Illyrians, who used Celtic weapons, tattooed themselves, and lived chiefly on spelt and millet; however, Strabo's suggestion of a mixed Celtic-Illyrian Iapydes culture is not confirmed by archaeology. Originally, Iapydes existed at least from the 9th century BC, and Celtic influence reached the region in the 4th century BC when Iapydes enter a decline. Archeological evidence of typical Celtic culture is documented only in the marginal contact zone of the Iapydes and the Celtic Taurisci along the Kupa river valley (now the Slovenian-Croatian border). Elsewhere, and especially in the main Iapydic area of the Lika highlands in Croatia, definite Celtic artifacts are scarce and explicable merely by commercial exchanges. Roman conquest Romans said of the Iapydes that they were a warlike race addicted to plundering expeditions, but other archaeological documentation confirms their main economical activity was the mining and metallurgy. That attracted the pragmatic Romans to conquer their country, whose river valleys were also a natural way for strategic communications between the Adriatic and Pannonia. Therefore, induced conflicts started from 171 BC, when consul Gaius Cassius Longinus first attacked Iapydes. In 129 BC, Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus attacked the Iapydes and was nearly defeated, but Decimus Iunius Brutus arrived and rescued him, and he celebrated a triumph.CIL I2 48176 Lucius Aurelius Cotta and Gaius Caecilius Metellus undertook another expedition against the Iapydes in 119, which concluded with a triumph in 117. In 78‚Äì76 BC they were also attacked by Gaius Cosconius as part of a war against the Dalmatians.J. J. Wilkes, Dalmatia (1969), 30-34, 46. They had a foedus from 56 BC with Rome and paid a tributum, but then from 52‚Äì47 BC rebelled. In 34 BC they were finally conquered by Augustus Caesar. Then they conserved a partial autonomy with a domestic praepositus Iapodum. Culture and society Due to the rich and extensive forests of their mountainous country, their houses were mostly wooden huts, and they rarely used stone constructions except in some major fortifications. Their settlements were mostly on hilltops, including between 400‚Äì3,000 dwellers, and the main Iapodic settlements in Roman times were Metulum, Terpon, Arupium and Avendo. They cultivated chiefly cereals and grapes, and kept varied cattle. Their early metallurgy developed a half millennium before Celtic influence that induced here minor modifications. Their society was simple including warriors, villagers, herdsmen, miners, and metalworkers. In that early phase neither leaders nor elite were indicated, and these independent Iapydes had no detectable collective political organisation. Under the Romans, a Romanized elite emerged, led by the praepositus Iapodum installed by Romans. Their classical culture was a varied mixture of Pannonian, Illyrian, Greek and Roman influences, mostly without proper peculiarities. Their figural art included the frequent metal decorations in the form of triangles and spirals, and large amber pearls and amber figurines. The Iapydic language before the Romans is mostly unknown: the only indications available are their toponyms and necropolis inscriptions from Roman times. These scarce onomastic indications suggest the Iapydic tongue may be correlated with other Illyrian and Pannonian tribes. During their independence, the Iapydes appear to have been completely illiterate and left no inscriptions before the Roman conquest. Religion The original religion of Iapydes is scarcely known, and it appears to be similar with other eastward Illyrians. They knew the divine pair of water-deities Vidassus (as Roman Sylvanus) and Thana (as Roman Diana), whose rocky reliefs persist today at some springs in their area. They worshiped the holy horse as their tribal totem, and also the holy snakes as the symbol of their ancestors. Their early tombs were usually in caves, and then in Roman times often in wooden sarcophagi and also incinerated in ceramic urns. Japodian burial urns were art a unique form influenced to a degree by the Situla art of northern Illyria and Italy and by Greek art.Stipƒçeviƒá, Aleksandar (1977). The Illyrians: history and culture.

Lobatae. It is native to the eastern and central United States, from Long Island to Florida, west as far as Texas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. There are reports of a few isolated populations in southern Michigan, but these appear to represent introductions. Blackjack oak leaves Blackjack oak stump, approx. 75 years old Quercus marilandica is a small deciduous tree growing to tall, with bark cracked into rectangular black plates with narrow orange fissures. The leaves are long and broad, and typically flare from a tapered base to a broad three-lobed bell shape with only shallow indentations. They are dark green and glossy above, pubescent underneath, and often remain attached to the twigs through the winter after turning colors from red to brown in the fall. The acorn is small, long and broad; like other red oaks, it takes 18 months to mature. Habitat and distribution The blackjack oak grows in poor, thin, dry, rocky or sandy soils where few other woody plants can thrive, usually on low ground, from sea level up to approximately in altitude. Some commentators say that it does not have the beautiful form of many oaks, but is nonetheless a valuable tree for growing in problem sites. Some say that the tree is \\"tough but ugly\\", but also underappreciated. At times the tree has even been actively eradicated to provide room for trees deemed to be more commercially valuable. It is sometimes an understory tree in pine stands on sandy knolls in the southeastern US. Along the coastal plain of New Jersey the probability of finding this species is increased in relatively sunny, open areas such as those near coastal salt marshes. It often occurs near scarlet and post oaks as well as pitch pine; understory companions include winged sumac, bracken, sweetfern, and bayberry, and can be found as far north as parts of Ohio and New York. A variety, Quercus marilandica M√ºnchhausen var. ashei Sudworth, grows in the western portions of its range ‚Äì northern Texas, Oklahoma, and into southern Kansas. In this area, blackjack and post oak form a semi-savanna area composed of forested strips intermixed with prairie grass glades along the eastern edge of the southern Great Plains. This semi-savanna is known as the Cross Timbers. Scrub forms of Q. marilandica dominate on many chert glades along with Q.stellata in Arkansas's Ozark plateau. Blackjack oak sometimes hybridizes with bear oak (Quercus ilicifolia), forming a hybrid known as Q. √ó brittonii. Blackjacks in the Cross Timbers can grow from high with a trunk diameter of , but seldom reach more than . The leaves are from in length and about the same width. Blackjack acorns provide food for both whitetail deer and wild turkey. Blackjacks may, however, cause tannic acid poisoning in cattle. Uses The wood is very dense and produces a hot flame when burned, which functions as an excellent source of heat for barbecues and wood-burning stoves. However, the wood is not desirable for wood fireplaces because the heat causes popping, thereby increasing the risk of house fires. Traditionally blackjack wood is used as both a fuel and smoke wood for barbecue in Oklahoma.

He proposed an agrarian law aimed at redistributing land for the landless poor in Rome to farm. We know about this through the speeches delivered by Marcus Tullius Cicero against this bill. Cicero delivered four speeches. Three are extant. The beginning of the first speech is missing. The fourth speech is lost. We do not have any other sources except for passing references by Plutarch and Suetonius. Agrarian bill The bill provided for the election of a ten-man commission (decimviri) which would have authority for five years. Its task was to distribute land to 5,000 colonists in lots of ten jugera in the ager Campanus and in lots of twelve jugera in the nearby campus Stellaris (both areas were in Campania, north of Naples). Further plots of land were intended and land was to be bought for this. To raise funds for this, the decemviri were empowered to sell public land whose sale had been recommended by senatus consulta (written advice by the senate) since 81 BC, but had not been carried out. It was also empowered to sell domains outside Italy which had become public property in 88 BC or later. The decimviri were also authorised to tax public land outside Italy, to use the Vectigalia from 63 BC It is thought that originally the Vectigalia was a tax on import and export duty; later it became a term used for all regular state revenues; William Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities and the gold and silver from war booty not paid into the treasury or spent on monuments. Military commanders gave some of their booty to the state treasury and spent some of it to build temples and public facilities or to erect statues. Pompey was exempted from this. He was commanding the Roman troops in the last phase of the Third Mithridatic War (73‚Äì63 BC) against Pontus and Armenia (in present- day eastern Turkey). Because of his absence from Rome he was not eligible to be a candidate for the election of the decemviri.G. V. Sumner, Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus, Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 97 (1966), pp. 571-2 Cicero portrayed Publius Servilius Rullus as an insignificant figure and alleged that he was a front for unsavoury men he described as the real architects of the bill, as 'machinators' and as the men who had the real power and were to be feared more than Rullus. He claimed that they hoped to become decemviri. He did not name these men, but dropped hints which made them identifiable. He said that among those men who were after joining the commission there would be \\"some of them to whom nothing appears sufficient to possess, some to whom nothing seems sufficient to squander.\\" Cicero, On the Agrarian Laws, 2.65 The first was a reference to the popular image of Marcus Licinius Crassus and the second one referred to the popular image of Julius Caesar.G. V. Sumner, Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus, Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 97 (1966), p. 573 The speeches of Cicero need to be understood in terms of the frictions between two political factions, the populares (in favour of the people) and the optimates (the good men). The former favoured the plebeians (the commoners), wanted to address the problems of the urban poor and promoted reforms which would help them, particularly the redistribution of land for the landless poor to farm and the problem of indebtedness. The latter was a conservative faction which favoured the patricians (the aristocracy). It opposed the mentioned reforms. It also wanted to limit the power of the plebeian tribunes and the Plebeian Council (the assembly of the plebeians) and strengthen the power of the senate, which represented the patricians. At that time Crassus and Caesar were leading figures of the populares. Cicero was a leading figure of the optimates and as such he was opposed to the bill. Cicero exaggerated the power which the land commission would be given by the bill. He described the commission as \\"... ten Kings of the treasury, of the revenues, of all provinces, of the whole Republic, of the kingdoms allied with us, the free nations confederate with us - in fact, ten Lords of the world are to be set up under the pretence and name of an agrarian law.\\" Cicero, on the Agrarian laws, 2.15 He also exaggerated the implications of the commission's power to sell domains outside Italy which had become public property. He claimed that \\"all nations, and people, and provinces, and kingdoms, are given up and handed over to the dominion, and judgment, and power of the decimviri ‚Ä¶ and asked ‚Ä¶ what place there is anywhere in the world which the decemviri may not be able to say has been made the property of the Roman people [public property]?\\" Cicero, on the Agrarian laws, 2.39 He also alleged that all the lands and cities in Asia which had been ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô by Sulla and Pompey in Asia would be declared public property and sold by the commissioners. He said Lucius Cornelius Sulla (the commander in the First Mithridatic War, 89‚Äì85 BC) had recovered land in Asia. However, Sulla had fought and recovered territories only in Greece. There was no land which was Roman public property or could be declared as such in Greece. He said that Pompey also recovered land in Asia. After winning the Third Mithridatic War Pompey annexed Cilicia Trachea, part of Pontus (both in today's Turkey), and Syria. However, these were annexations, rather than recoveries of territories. Moreover, at the time of the bill the war was still on and Pompey's settlements in Asia were yet to be completed. Sumner points out that by mos maiorum the adjudication and control of the estates in the acquired territories were to rest with Pompey.G. V. Sumner, Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus, Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 97 (1966), p. 577 Hence, here Cicero's statements were contentious and part of effort to purport that Crassus and Caesar wanted to use the bill to prepare for a conflict with Pompey (see below). Interpretations There are various interpretations of the political motivations of this agrarian bill among various historians. 1) The most common one is that Crassus and Caesar sought to seize power through a coup d‚Äô √©tat against Pompey and/or the senate or that they were after command in Egypt to enable them to fight Pompey.Mommsen, Romische Geschicte 3, 1889, pp. 181-2Marsh, F.B., Founding of the Roman Empire, 1927, p. 77Holmes, Roman Republic I, 1932, p.243Edward Mayer Caesars Monachie ou du Principat du Pompeius, 1933, p. 14Vogst, Cicero und Salust, 1938, p.21M. Gelzer, Caesar, 1960, p. 37 2) Crassus wanted to control the allotment of land so that he would have a strong bargaining position when Pompey came back from the war and sought land for his veterans (soldiers were entitled to a grant of a plot of land on their discharge);Scullard, H. H., From the Gracchi to Nero, 1963, p. 111Cary, M., in CAH 9, p. 456 3) The bill was a bribery scheme to provide profits for the merchants and a new tax source for the publicani (these were private tax collectors, the republican state tendered this collection to private tax collectors who used their position to line their pockets and for extortion);Afzelius, A., Ackerverteilungsgesets des P. Servilius Rullus, Classica et Medievalia 3, 1940, pp. 222-3 4) The bill was never meant to be passed and served to show up Circero in this true colours, as an optimate- lover, rather than consul in favour of the people and to heighten the conflict between the plebeians and the senate.Afzelius, A., Ackerverteilungsgesets des P. Servilius Rullus, Classica et Medievalia 3, 1940, p. 230 5) The purpose of the bill was genuinely to give land to the landless poor. According to this view, this was intended to rid Rome of these people who were seen as idle and dangerous and improve the security of the city.Hardy, E.G., Some Problems in Roman History, 1924, p. 68 Conspiracy theories are unlikely and based on the rhetoric of Cicero and on the remarks of Plutarch and Suetonius. These two later writers had pro-aristocracy views and always portrayed the plebeian tribunes in a negative light. As for Cicero's speeches, their rhetoric appears to be designed to undermine support for the bill. Cicero tried to give a conspiratorial hue to the bill. He alleged that the architects of the bill were against both Pompey and himself. He said that they hoped to use the powers of the commissioners to allot land to discharged soldiers to take away from Pompey his right to give his veterans land and, through this, the support of his veterans. He added that he was concerned that they would do so during his term as consul to undermine him because they despised him.Cicero, On The Agrarian Laws. 2.54-55 This is what interpretations 2 and 4 rest on. Cicero repeatedly made his claim about an anti-Pompeian agenda. He said that the commissions would \\"in the first place take care that Gnaeus [Pompey] should be removed from all power of protecting your [the people's] liberty, from all power to promote, from all commission to watch over, and from all means of protecting your interests [,]\\" and that they thought it \\"expedient to oppose Gnaeus [Pompey] as your defence against all defects and wickednesses in the law.\\" Cicero, On The Agrarian Laws. 2.25 He called the commissioners \\"Ten general against Pompey.\\" Cicero,On The Agrarian Laws. 2.54-55 Cicero was also at pain to present himself as a consul who stood for the people and not for the aristocrats or the optimantes: \\"I have been made consul, not by the zeal of the powerful citizens, nor by the preponderating influence of a few men, but by the deliberate judgment of the Roman people, and that, too, in such a way as to be preferred to men of the very highest rank, to avoid, both in this magistracy and throughout my whole life, devoting myself to the interests of the people.\\" Cicero, On The Agrarian Laws. 2.7 He presented himself as a man who stood in opposition against men who pretended to stand in the interests of the people but were in actual fact a danger to the people (this was a reference to the populares): \\"For there is a great error abroad, by reason of the treacherous pretences made by some people, who, though they oppose and hinder not only the advantage but even the safety of the people, still endeavour by their speeches to make men believe them zealous for the interests of the people.\\" Cicero, On The Agrarian Laws. 2.7 To further bolster his speeches, Cicero claimed that the Publius Rullus would sell Alexandria and Egypt. In 65 BC there was a proposal to annex Egypt. This was made by the plebeian tribunes. According to Suetonius Julius Caesar, who wanted to get the command in Egypt, put them up to it.Suetonius, The Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 11.1 According to Plutarch, instead, Crassus promoted this.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Crassus, 13.1-2 Plutarch wrote his biographies more than 160 years after these events and Suetonius wrote his about 280 years later. The proposal was made on the basis of a claim that Ptolemy Alexander I of Egypt bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. Cicero said: \\"I know that there is a resolution of the senate extant to the effect that it accepted the inheritance ‚Ä¶ [Publius Servilius Rullus] will also, in accordance with his own law, sell Alexandria, and sell Egypt. He will be found to be the judge, the arbiter, the master, of a most wealthy city, and of a most beautiful country; yes, he will be found to be the king of a most opulent kingdom. Will he abstain from taking all this? from desiring all this? He will decide that Alexandria belongs to the king; he will by his sentence deprive the Roman people of it.\\" Cicero, On The Agrarian Law, 2.43 In the last part of the sentence Cicero implied that, should Egypt be annexed, the plebeian tribune and the other decemviri would use the sale of Alexandria and Egypt for their own profit. Sumner points out that the proposal to annex Egypt by some plebeian tribunes in 65 BC had been rejected and that the commission would have to have the annexation approved by the senate or the assembly of the people. The bill did leave the possibility of annexation open by setting the cut off for the selling of domains outside Italy which had been seen as public property form 88 BC onward. This was the year in which Ptolemy Alexander I was deposed. However, not only the annexation would have to be approved by either of the mentioned bodies, so would the declaration of the royal property in Egypt as Roman public property. Thus, as Sumner notes, the bill did not allow the land commission 'to go and grab Egypt'. One this could add to this that the law did not allow the land commission to make a declaration on public land. The annexation of Egypt was a very unlikely scenario. Even in such a case, Sumner points out that the most likely Roman commander who would have benefited would have been Pompey, who was already in the east and was ending the war there. He would have been the best positioned man to handle the annexation of Egypt. Moreover, the 65 BC proposal to annex Egypt occurred during the period of ascendancy of Pompey and followed the Gabinian Law (67 BC), which gave Pompey extraordinary proconsular powers in any province within 50 miles of the Mediterranean Sea to deal with the problem of piracy, and the 66 BC Manilian Law (which Cicero had supported), which gave Pompey the mandate to replace the previous Romans commander in the Third Mithridatic War and gave him supreme command in the last phase of this war. Sumner also notes that the opponents to these two laws were optimates and that Julius Caesar had supported them.G. V. Sumner, Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus, Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 97 (1966), p. 576-79 The planned coup d' √©tat interpretation of the political motivations behind the bill is based on the idea that Caesar was after the command of Egypt after its annexation. Fate of the bill The bill did not pass the vote. Cicero opposed subsequent proposals for agrarian laws to redistribute land. In 59 BC Julius Caesar managed to pass a law which gave land to 20,000 Roman citizens with more than three children in Campania, in the same area which had been earmarked for redistribution by the bill of Publius Servilius Rullus.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar,20.3Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.10 Caesar managed to do so thanks to the enormous political power of the First Triumvirate, the informal political alliance Caesar made with Crassus and Pompey.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.9-10 See also * Servilia (gens) Notes References Primary Sources * Cicero, Three Orations On The Agrarian Law, The Four Against Catiline, The Orations For Rabirius, Murena Sylla, Archias, Flaccus, Scaurus, Etc., Arkose Press, 2015; * Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Live of Crassus, The Complete Collection of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2014; ; see accessed June 206 * Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, Penguin Classics; Revised edition, 2007; ; see accessed June 2016 Secondary sources * Afzelius, A., Ackerverteilungsgesets des P.

Some sources in the article report dates as old style rather than new style.) was a Russian composer, and a member of the group of composers known as The Five.The Five, also known as The Mighty Handful or The Mighty Coterie, refers to a circle of composers who met in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in the years 1856‚Äì1870: Mily Balakirev (the leader), C√©sar Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Alexander Borodin. He was a master of orchestration. His best-known orchestral compositions‚ÄîCapriccio Espagnol, the Russian Easter Festival Overture, and the symphonic suite Scheherazade‚Äîare staples of the classical music repertoire, along with suites and excerpts from some of his 15 operas. Scheherazade is an example of his frequent use of fairy-tale and folk subjects. Rimsky-Korsakov believed in developing a nationalistic style of classical music, as did his fellow-composer Mily Balakirev and the critic Vladimir Stasov. This style employed Russian folk song and lore along with exotic harmonic, melodic and rhythmic elements in a practice known as musical orientalism, and eschewed traditional Western compositional methods. Rimsky-Korsakov appreciated Western musical techniques after he became a professor of musical composition, harmony, and orchestration at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1871. He undertook a rigorous three- year program of self-education and became a master of Western methods, incorporating them alongside the influences of Mikhail Glinka and fellow members of The Five. Rimsky-Korsakov's techniques of composition and orchestration were further enriched by his exposure to the works of Richard Wagner. For much of his life, Rimsky-Korsakov combined his composition and teaching with a career in the Russian military‚Äîat first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This love of the sea may have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and Scheherazade. As Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law, Maximilian Steinberg. Rimsky-Korsakov left a considerable body of original Russian nationalist compositions. He prepared works by The Five for performance, which brought them into the active classical repertoire (although there is controversy over his editing of the works of Modest Mussorgsky), and shaped a generation of younger composers and musicians during his decades as an educator. Rimsky-Korsakov is therefore considered \\"the main architect\\" of what the classical-music public considers the \\"Russian style\\" of composition. His influence on younger composers was especially important, as he served as a transitional figure between the autodidactism exemplified by Glinka and The Five, and professionally trained composers which would become the norm in Russia by the closing years of the 19th century. While Rimsky-Korsakov's style was based on those of Glinka, Balakirev, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt and, for a brief period, Wagner, he \\"transmitted this style directly to two generations of Russian composers\\" and influenced non-Russian composers including Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, Paul Dukas, and Ottorino Respighi.Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:34. Biography =Early years= Rimsky-Korsakov's birthplace in Tikhvin Rimsky-Korsakov was born in Tikhvin, east of Saint Petersburg, into a Russian noble family. The Rimsky-Korsakov dynasty traced their roots to Zhigimunt Korsak, a Czech who arrived in Lithuania from the Holy Roman Empire and founded the Polish-Lithuanian Korsak coat of arms. In 1390, his sons Vyacheslav (originally Vaclav) and Miloslav escorted Sophia of Lithuania, then a wife of Vasily I Dmitriyevich, to Moscow and took Russian citizenship under the Korsakov and Miloslavsky surnames, respectively. Some of Vyacheslav's descendants were granted permission to add \\"Rimsky\\" to their surnames in 1677 to celebrate their so-called Roman roots. Throughout history, members of the family served in Russian government and took various positions as governors and war generals. Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov was famously a lover of Catherine the Great.Rimsky-Korsakov coat of arms by All-Russian Armorials of Noble Houses of the Russian Empire. Part 2, June 30, 1798 (in Russian)Tatiana Rimskaya- Korsakova (2008). N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov.

Using his friendship with Aleksey Arakcheyev, he managed to grant them all the privileges of the noble family.Tatiana Rimskaya- Korsakova (1995). Childhood and Youth of N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov. From the Family Letters. ‚Äì Saint Petersburg: Compositor, 278 pages, pp. 9‚Äì10; Andrei went on to serve in the Interior Ministry of the Russian Empire, then as the vice-governor of Novgorod, and then in the Volhynian Governorate. The composer's mother, Sofya Vasilievna Rimskaya-Korsakova (1802‚Äì1890), was also born as an illegitimate daughter of a peasant serf and Vasily Fedorovich Skaryatin, a wealthy landlord who belonged to the noble Russian family that originated during the 16th century.Skaryatin coat of arms by All-Russian Armorials of Noble Houses of the Russian Empire. Part 6, 23 June 1801 (in Russian) She was raised by her father in full comfort, yet under an improvised surname Vasilieva and with no legal status. By the time Andrei Petrovich met her, he was already a widower: his first wife, knyazna Ekaterina Meshcherskaya, died just nine months after their marriage. Nevertheless, they fell in love with each other at first sight. Since Skaryatin found him unsuitable for his daughter, Andrei secretly \\"stole\\" his bride from the father's house and brought her to Saint Petersburg where they got married. The Rimsky-Korsakov family had a long line of military and naval service. Nikolai's older brother Voin, 22 years his senior, became a well-known navigator and explorer and had a powerful influence on Nikolai's life.Taruskin, Music, 166. He later recalled that his mother played the piano a little, and his father could play a few songs on the piano by ear.Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, 4. Beginning at six, he took piano lessons from local teachers and showed a talent for aural skills,Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:27. but he showed a lack of interest, playing, as he later wrote, \\"badly, carelessly, ... poor at keeping time\\".Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, p. 5. Although he started composing by age 10, Rimsky-Korsakov preferred literature over music. He later wrote that from his reading, and tales of his brother's exploits, he developed a poetic love for the sea \\"without ever having seen it\\".Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 8. This love, and prompting from Voin, encouraged the 12-year-old to join the Imperial Russian Navy. He studied at the School for Mathematical and Navigational Sciences in Saint Petersburg and, at 18, took his final examination in April 1862. Rimsky-Korsakov in 1866, when he was a michman in the Russian Navy While at school, Rimsky-Korsakov took piano lessons from a man named Ulikh.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 11. These lessons were sanctioned by Voin, who now served as director of the school, because he hoped they would help the youth to develop social skills and overcome his shyness. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that, while \\"indifferent\\" to lessons, he developed a love for music, fostered by visits to the opera and, later, orchestral concerts.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, pp. 11‚Äì13. Ulikh perceived Rimsky-Korsakov's musical talent and recommended another teacher, Feodor A. Kanille (Th√©odore Canill√©).Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 15. Beginning in late 1859, Rimsky-Korsakov took lessons in piano and composition from Kanille, whom he later credited as the inspiration for devoting his life to musical composition.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, p. 16. Through Kanille, he was exposed to a great deal of new music, including Mikhail Glinka and Robert Schumann.Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 21:400. Voin cancelled his younger brother's musical lessons when the latter reached the age of 17, feeling they no longer served a practical purpose. Kanille told Rimsky- Korsakov to continue coming to him every Sunday, not for formal lessons but to play duets and discuss music.Calvocoressi and Abraham, Masters of Russian Music, 342. In November 1861, Kanille introduced the 18-year-old Nikolai to Mily Balakirev. Balakirev in turn introduced him to C√©sar Cui and Modest Mussorgsky; all three were known as composers, despite only being in their 20s.Abraham, New Grove (1980), 2:28; Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 18. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, \\"With what delight I listened to real business discussions [Rimsky-Korsakov's emphasis] of instrumentation, part writing, etc! And besides, how much talking there was about current musical matters! All at once I had been plunged into a new world, unknown to me, formerly only heard of in the society of my dilettante friends. That was truly a strong impression.\\"Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, pp. 19‚Äì20. The Russian military clipper Almaz in New York Harbor in 1863. Rimsky-Korsakov served as a midshipman on this ship and later wrote about this cruise. Balakirev encouraged Rimsky-Korsakov to compose and taught him the rudiments when he was not at sea. Balakirev prompted him to enrich himself in history, literature and criticism.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 38. When he showed Balakirev the beginning of a symphony in E-flat minor that he had written, Balakirev insisted he continue working on it despite his lack of formal musical training.Abraham, A Short Biography, pp. 23‚Äì25. By the time Rimsky-Korsakov sailed on a two-year-and-eight-month cruise aboard the clipper Almaz in late 1862, he had completed and orchestrated three movements of the symphony.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life; 22.This is not the first symphony by a Russian: Anton Rubinstein composed his first symphony in 1850 (Figes, 391). He composed the slow movement during a stop in England and mailed the score to Balakirev before going back to sea.Abraham, New Grove (1980), 2:28; Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 42. At first, his work on the symphony kept Rimsky-Korsakov occupied during his cruise. He purchased scores at every port of call, along with a piano on which to play them, and filled his idle hours studying Berlioz's Treatise on Instrumentation. He found time to read the works of Homer, William Shakespeare, Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; he saw London, Niagara Falls, and Rio de Janeiro during his stops in port. Eventually, the lack of outside musical stimuli dulled the young midshipman's hunger to learn. He wrote to Balakirev that after two years at sea he had neglected his musical lessons for months. \\"Thoughts of becoming a musician and composer gradually left me altogether\\", he later recalled; \\"distant lands began to allure me, somehow, although, properly speaking, naval service never pleased me much and hardly suited my character at all.\\"Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, p. 48. =Mentored by Balakirev; time with The Five= Once back in Saint Petersburg in May 1865, Rimsky-Korsakov's onshore duties consisted of a couple of hours of clerical duty each day, but he recalled that his desire to compose \\"had been stifled ... I did not concern myself with music at all.\\"Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 55. He wrote that contact with Balakirev in September 1865 encouraged him \\"to get accustomed to music and later to plunge into it\\".Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 56. At Balakirev's suggestion, he wrote a trio to the scherzo of the E-flat minor symphony, which it had lacked up to that point, and reorchestrated the entire symphony.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 58‚Äì59. Its first performance came in December of that year under Balakirev's direction in Saint Petersburg.Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:28. A second performance followed in March 1866 under the direction of Konstantin Lyadov (father of composer Anatoly Lyadov). Correspondence between Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev clearly shows that some ideas for the symphony originated with Balakirev. Balakirev seldom stopped at merely correcting a piece of music, and would often recompose it at the piano. Rimsky-Korsakov recalled, > A pupil like myself had to submit to Balakirev a proposed composition in its > embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately > make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would > criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure > the next two, ridicule them, and try hard to make the author disgusted with > them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, > frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended over a > long period of time under the cold control of self-criticism.Rimsky- > Korsakov, My Musical Life, 29. Mily Balakirev encouraged Rimsky-Korsakov to continue composing. Rimsky- Korsakov recalled that \\"Balakirev had no difficulty in getting along with me. At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed by me and brought them to completion with the help of his advice and improvisations\\".Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 30. Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev's influence stifling, and broke free from it,Maes, 44. this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer's talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev's mentoring, Rimsky- Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and abandoned it. He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes, based on Balakirev's folksong overtures, as well as a Fantasia on Serbian Themes that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the Slavonic Congress in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov coined the phrase Moguchaya kuchka for the Balakirev circle (Moguchaya kuchka is usually translated as \\"The Mighty Handful\\" or \\"The Five\\"). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of Sadko and Antar, which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works. Rimsky-Korsakov socialized and discussed music with the other members of The Five; they critiqued one another's works in progress and collaborated on new pieces. He became friends with Alexander Borodin, whose music \\"astonished\\" him.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 57. He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky. Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four-hand music, Mussorgsky would sing, and they frequently discussed other composers' works, with preferred tastes running \\"toward Glinka, Schumann and Beethoven's late quartets\\".Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, 21. Mendelssohn was not thought of highly, Mozart and Haydn \\"were considered out of date and na√Øve\\", and J.S. Bach merely mathematical and unfeeling. Berlioz \\"was highly esteemed\\", Liszt \\"crippled and perverted from a musical point of view ... even a caricature\\", and Wagner discussed little. Rimsky-Korsakov \\"listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev, Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination\\". Often, the musical works in question \\"were played before me only in fragments, and I had no idea of the whole work\\". This, he wrote, did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them \\"as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth\\". Rimsky-Korsakov became especially appreciated within The Five, and among those who visited the circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a Schubert march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera William Ratcliff and by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera The Stone Guest. In late 1871, Rimsky-Korsakov moved into Voin's former apartment, and invited Mussorgsky to be his roommate. The working arrangement they agreed upon was that Mussorgsky used the piano in the mornings while Rimsky-Korsakov worked on copying or orchestration. When Mussorgsky left for his civil service job at noon, Rimsky- Korsakov then used the piano. Time in the evenings was allotted by mutual agreement. \\"That autumn and winter the two of us accomplished a good deal\\", Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, \\"with constant exchange of ideas and plans. Mussorgsky composed and orchestrated the Polish act of Boris Godunov and the folk scene 'Near Kromy.' I orchestrated and finished my Maid of Pskov.\\"Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 123. =Professorship, marriage, inspector of bands= In 1871, the 27-year-old Rimsky-Korsakov became Professor of Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration) at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, as well as leader of the Orchestra Class. He retained his position in active naval service, and taught his classes in uniform (military officers in Russia were required to wear their uniforms every day, as they were considered to be always on duty).Figes, 18. Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where Rimsky-Korsakov taught from 1871 to 1906 Rimsky-Korsakov explained in his memoirs that Mikha√≠l Azanchevsky had taken over that year as director of the Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects,Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 116. had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services.Maes, 48. Biographer Mikhail Tsetlin (aka Mikhail Zetlin) suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there.Zetlin, 194. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western- based style.Zetlin, 194‚Äì95. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor,Maes, 39. but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.Maes, 169‚Äì70. Rimsky- Korsakov's reputation at this time was as a master of orchestration, based on Sadko and Antar.Zetlin, 195. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform.Zetlin, 195‚Äì96. Aware of his technical shortcomings,Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 117. Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky,Brown, Crisis Years, 228‚Äì29; Maes, 48. with whom he and the others in The Five had been in occasional contact.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 75. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory,Brown, Early Years, 54‚Äì83. and was serving as Professor of Music Theory at the Moscow Conservatory.Brown, Early Years, 88‚Äì89. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.Brown, Crisis Years, 228‚Äì29. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that while teaching at the Conservatory he soon became \\"possibly its very best pupil [Rimsky-Korsakov's emphasis], judging by the quantity and value of the information it gave me!\\"Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 119. To prepare himself, and to stay at least one step ahead of his students, he took a three-year sabbatical from composing original works, and assiduously studied at home while he lectured at the Conservatory. He taught himself from textbooks,Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:29. and followed a strict regimen of composing contrapuntal exercises, fugues, chorales and a cappella choruses. Rimsky-Korsakov eventually became an excellent teacher and a fervent believer in academic training.Maes, 170. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as Sadko and Antar, in a search for perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class, he mastered the art of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his Third Symphony, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self- improvement, reflects his hands-on experience with the orchestra. Nadezhda Rimskaya-Korsakova, n√©e Purgold, wife of the composerProfessorship brought Rimsky-Korsakov financial security,Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:28 which encouraged him to settle down and to start a family. In December 1871 he proposed to Nadezhda Purgold, with whom he had developed a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the Purgold household.Schonberg, 362; Zetlin, 164‚Äì66. They married in July 1872, with Mussorgsky serving as best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs had seven children. One of their sons, Andrei, became a musicologist, married the composer Yuliya Veysberg and wrote a multi- volume study of his father's life and work.McAllister and Rayskin, New Grove (2001), 21:423‚Äì24. Nadezhda became a musical as well as domestic partner with her husband, much as Clara Schumann had been with her own husband Robert. She was beautiful, capable, strong-willed, and far better trained musically than her husband at the time they marriedAbraham, New Grove (1980)16:28‚Äì29.‚Äîshe had attended the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in the mid-1860s, studying piano with Anton Gerke (one of whose private students was Mussorgsky)Zetlin, 164. and music theory with Nikolai Zaremba, who also taught Tchaikovsky.Neff, New Grove (2001), 21:423. Nadezhda proved a fine and most demanding critic of her husband's work; her influence over him in musical matters was strong enough for Balakirev and Stasov to wonder whether she was leading him astray from their musical preferences.Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 21:401. Musicologist Lyle Neff wrote that while Nadezhda gave up her own compositional career when she married Rimsky-Korsakov, she \\"had a considerable influence on the creation of [Rimsky-Korsakov's] first three operas. She travelled with her husband, attended rehearsals and arranged compositions by him and others\\" for piano four hands, which she played with her husband. \\"Her last years were dedicated to issuing her husband's posthumous literary and musical legacy, maintaining standards for performance of his works ... and preparing material for a museum in his name.\\" Portrait of Rimsky-Korsakov by Ilya Repin In early 1873, the navy created the civilian post of Inspector of Naval Bands, with a rank of Collegiate Assessor, and appointed Rimsky-Korsakov. This kept him on the navy payroll and listed on the roster of the Chancellery of the Navy Department but allowed him to resign his commission.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical life, 135‚Äì36. The composer commented, \\"I parted with delight with both my military status and my officer's uniform\\", he later wrote. \\"Henceforth I was a musician officially and incontestably.\\" As Inspector, Rimsky-Korsakov applied himself with zeal to his duties. He visited naval bands throughout Russia, supervised the bandmasters and their appointments, reviewed the bands' repertoire, and inspected the quality of their instruments. He wrote a study program for a complement of music students who held navy fellowships at the Conservatory, and acted as an intermediary between the Conservatory and the navy. He also indulged in a long-standing desire to familiarize himself with the construction and playing technique of orchestral instruments.Leonard, 148. These studies prompted him to write a textbook on orchestration.Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, 136. He used the privileges of rank to exercise and expand upon his knowledge. He discussed arrangements of musical works for military band with bandmasters, encouraged and reviewed their efforts, held concerts at which he could hear these pieces, and orchestrated original works, and works by other composers, for military bands.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 141‚Äì42. In March 1884, an Imperial Order abolished the navy office of Inspector of Bands, and Rimsky-Korsakov was relieved of his duties. He worked under Balakirev in the Court Chapel as a deputy until 1894,Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 8:404; Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 335 which allowed him to study Russian Orthodox church music. He also taught classes at the Chapel, and wrote his textbook on harmony for use there and at the Conservatory. =Backlash and May Night= Rimsky-Korsakov's studies and his change in attitude regarding music education brought him the scorn of his fellow nationalists, who thought he was throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas.Schonberg, 363. After he strove \\"to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible\\" into his Third Symphony,Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 133. he wrote chamber works adhering strictly to classical models, including a string sextet, a string quartet in F minor and a quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano. About the quartet and the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, that they \\"were filled with a host of clever things but ... [were] imbued with a dryly pedantic character\\". Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony, he kept \\"feeling that this is the work of a German Herr Professor who has put on his glasses and is about to write Eine grosse Symphonie in C\\".Zetlin, 303‚Äì04. According to Rimsky-Korsakov, the other members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the orchestra in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that \\"they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path\\". Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by Anton Rubinstein, a composer opposed to the nationalists' music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov \\"might amount to something\\" as a composer.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 151. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 157 ft. 30. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, \\"Apparently [Rimsky-Korsakov] is now passing through this crisis, and how it will end will be difficult to predict. Either a great master will come out of him, or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks\\".As quoted in Brown, Crisis Years, 229. Portrait of Mikhail Glinka by Ilya Repin. Rimsky-Korsakov credited his editing of Glinka's scores with leading him back toward modern music. Two projects helped Rimsky-Korsakov focus on less academic music-making. The first was the creation of two folk song collections in 1874. Rimsky-Korsakov transcribed 40 Russian songs for voice and piano from performances by folk singer Tvorty Filippov,Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 164. who approached him at Balakirev's suggestion.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 163. This collection was followed by a second containing 100 songs, supplied by friends and servants, or taken from rare and out-of-print collections.Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 21:402.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 164‚Äì65. Rimsky-Korsakov later credited this work as a great influence on him as a composer;Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, 166. it also supplied a vast amount of musical material from which he could draw for future projects, either by direct quotation or as models for composing fakeloric passages. The second project was the editing of orchestral scores by pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka (1804‚Äì1857) in collaboration with Balakirev and Anatoly Lyadov. Glinka's sister, Lyudmila Ivanovna Shestakova, wanted to preserve her brother's musical legacy in print, and paid the costs of the project from her own pocket.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 172. No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music, and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed. While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka's music to \\"correct\\" what he saw as compositional flaws, Rimsky-Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach. Eventually, Rimsky-Korsakov prevailed. \\"Work on Glinka's scores was an unexpected schooling for me\\", he later wrote. \\"Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas; but as editor of the scores in print I had to go through Glinka's style and instrumentation to their last little note ... And this was a beneficent discipline for me, leading me as it did to the path of modern music, after my vicissitudes with counterpoint and strict style\\".Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 175. In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought increasingly about the short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The story had long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 188‚Äì89. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that May Night was of great importance because, despite the opera's containing a good deal of contrapuntal music, he nevertheless \\"cast off the shackles of counterpoint [emphasis Rimsky-Korsakov]\\".Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 208. He wrote the opera in a folk-like melodic idiom, and scored it in a transparent manner much in the style of Glinka. Nevertheless, despite the ease of writing this opera and the next, The Snow Maiden,Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 235. from time to time he suffered from creative paralysis between 1881 and 1888. He kept busy during this time by editing Mussorgsky's works and completing Borodin's Prince Igor (Mussorgsky died in 1881, Borodin in 1887). =Belyayev circle= Portrait by Ilya Repin of M. P. Belyayev, founder of the Russian Symphony Concerts Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that he became acquainted with budding music patron Mitrofan Belyayev (M. P. Belaieff) in Moscow in 1882.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 261. Belyayev was one of a growing coterie of Russian nouveau-riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th century Russia; their number included railway magnate Savva Mamontov and textile manufacturer Pavel Tretyakov.Figes, 195‚Äì97; Maes, 173‚Äì74, 196‚Äì97. Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov \\"wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life\\".Taruskin, 49. They had worked their way into wealth, and being Slavophiles in their national outlook believed in the greater glory of Russia. Because of this belief, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 42. This preference paralleled a general upsurge in nationalism and Russophilia that became prevalent in mainstream Russian art and society.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 44. By 1883 Rimsky-Korsakov had become a regular visitor to the weekly \\"quartet Fridays\\" (\\"Les Vendredis\\") held at Belyayev's home in Saint Petersburg.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 269. Belyayev, who had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage Alexander Glazunov, rented a hall and hired an orchestra in 1884 to play Glazunov's First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed. This concert and a rehearsal the previous year gave Rimsky-Korsakov the idea of offering concerts featuring Russian compositions, a prospect to which Belyayev was amenable. The Russian Symphony Concerts were inaugurated during the 1886‚Äì87 season, with Rimsky-Korsakov sharing conducting duties with Anatoly Lyadov.Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:29‚Äì30; Zetlin, 313. He finished his revision of Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and conducted it at the opening concert.Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, 281. The concerts also coaxed him out of his creative drought; he wrote Scheherazade, Capriccio Espagnol and the Russian Easter Overture specifically for them. He noted that these three works \\"show a considerable falling off in the use of contrapuntal devices ... [replaced] by a strong and virtuoso development of every kind of figuration which sustains the technical interest of my compositions\\".Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 296. Rimsky-Korsakov was asked for advice and guidance not just on the Russian Symphony Concerts, but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers. \\"By force of matters purely musical I turned out to be the head of the Belyayev circle\\", he wrote. \\"As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief\\".Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, 288. In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual Glinka prize, and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.Maes, 173. The group of composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky- Korsakov became known as the Belyayev circle, named after their financial benefactor. These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook, as The Five before them had been. Like The Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike The Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition‚Äîwhich Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.Maes, 192. Compared to the \\"revolutionary\\" composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be \\"progressive ... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but ... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily ...\\"Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 286‚Äì87. =Increased contact with Tchaikovsky= Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky by Nikolay Kuznetsov, 1893 In November 1887, Tchaikovsky arrived in Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts. One of them included the first complete performance of his First Symphony, subtitled Winter Daydreams, in its final version. Another concert featured the premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony in its revised version.Brown, Final Years, 91. Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky corresponded considerably before the visit and spent a lot of time together, along with Glazunov and Lyadov.Brown, Final Years, 90. Though Tchaikovsky had been a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home since 1876, and had at one point offered to arrange Rimsky-Korsakov's appointment as director of the Moscow Conservatory,Taruskin, Stravinsky, 31. this was the beginning of closer relations between the two. Within a couple of years, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, Tchaikovsky's visits became more frequent.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 308. During these visits and especially in public, Rimsky-Korsakov wore a mask of geniality. Privately, he found the situation emotionally complex, and confessed his fears to his friend, the Moscow critic Semyon Kruglikov.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 39. Memories persisted of the tension between Tchaikovsky and The Five over the differences in their musical philosophies‚Äîtension acute enough for Tchaikovsky's brother Modest to liken their relations at that time to \\"those between two friendly neighboring states ... cautiously prepared to meet on common ground, but jealously guarding their separate interests\\".As quoted in Holden, 64. Rimsky-Korsakov observed, not without annoyance, how Tchaikovsky became increasingly popular among Rimsky- Korsakov's followers.Poznansky, Quest, 564; Taruskin, Stravinsky, 39. This personal jealousy was compounded by a professional one, as Tchaikovsky's music became increasingly popular among the composers of the Belyayev circle, and remained on the whole more famous than his own.Holden, 316; Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 309; Taruskin, Stravinsky, 39. Even so, when Tchaikovsky attended Rimsky-Korsakov's nameday party in May 1893, Rimsky-Korsakov asked Tchaikovsky personally if he would conduct four concerts of the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg the following season. After hesitation, Tchaikovsky agreed.Brown, Final Years, 465. While his sudden death in late 1893 prevented him from fulfilling this commitment in its entirety, the list of works he had planned to conduct included Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony.Brown, Final Years, 474. =Increasing conservatism; second creative drought= In March 1889, Angelo Neumann's traveling \\"Richard Wagner Theater\\" visited Saint Petersburg, giving four cycles of Der Ring des Nibelungen there under the direction of Karl Muck. The Five had ignored Wagner's music, but The Ring impressed Rimsky-Korsakov:Maes, 176‚Äì77. he was astonished with Wagner's mastery of orchestration. He attended the rehearsals with Glazunov, and followed the score. After hearing these performances, Rimsky-Korsakov devoted himself almost exclusively to composing operas for the rest of his creative life. Wagner's use of the orchestra influenced Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestration,Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:30. beginning with the arrangement of the polonaise from Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov that he made for concert use in 1889.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 298. Toward music more adventurous than Wagner's, especially that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards when he heard pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy's Estampes and write in his diary about them, \\"Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination.\\"As quoted in Taruskin, Stravinsky, 55. This was part of an increasing musical conservatism on his part (his \\"musical conscience,\\" as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis, Vasily Yastrebtsev, \\"It's incredible that I ever could have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time.\\"As quoted in Taruskin, Stravinsky, 40. By 1901 he would write of growing \\"indignant at all [of Wagner's] blunders of the ear\\"‚Äîthis about the same music which caught his attention in 1889.Maes, 181. In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov suffered a second creative drought, brought on by bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessionsAbraham, New Grove, 16:31. led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household may have been a factor‚Äîthe serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently.Maes, 171. After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form. Another death brought about a creative renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity‚Äîto write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908‚Äîa total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it in the last four years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.Leonard, 149. =1905 Revolution= In 1905, demonstrations took place in the St. Petersburg Conservatory as part of the 1905 Revolution; these, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, were triggered by similar disturbances at St. Petersburg State University, in which students demanded political reforms and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Russia.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 411. \\"I was chosen a member of the committee for adjusting differences with agitated pupils\\", he recalled; almost as soon as the committee had been formed, \\"[a]ll sorts of measures were recommended to expel the ringleaders, to quarter the police in the Conservatory, to close the Conservatory entirely\\". Ilya Repin, 17 October 1905 A lifelong liberal politically,Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 21:405. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that he felt someone had to protect the rights of the students to demonstrate, especially as disputes and wrangling between students and authorities were becoming increasingly violent. In an open letter, he sided with the students against what he saw as unwarranted interference by Conservatory leadership and the Russian Musical Society. A second letter, this time signed by a number of faculty including Rimsky- Korsakov, demanded the resignation of the head of the Conservatory. Partly as a result of these two letters he wrote, approximately 100 Conservatory students were expelled and he was removed from his professorship.Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, 412. Just before the dismissal was enacted, Rimsky- Korsakov received a letter from one of the members of the school directorate, suggesting that he take up the directorship in the interest of calming student unrest. \\"Probably the member of the Directorate held a minority opinion, but signed the resolution nevertheless,\\" he wrote. \\"I sent a negative reply.\\"Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 478. Partly in defiance of his dismissal, Rimsky-Korsakov continued teaching his students from his home.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 1:386. Not long after Rimsky-Korsakov's dismissal, a student production of his opera Kashchey the Deathless was followed not with the scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, which led to a police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov's work.Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:32. Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events,Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 21:406. an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer's residence with letters of sympathy,Leonard, 167. and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov's music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov.Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 405‚Äì06. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory in solidarity with Rimsky- Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov. Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 73. The political controversy continued with his opera The Golden Cockerel. Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, and even then it was performed in an adapted version.Maes, 178. Rimsky-Korsakov's grave at Tikhvin Cemetery in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery In April 1907, Rimsky-Korsakov conducted a pair of concerts in Paris, hosted by impresario Sergei Diaghilev, which featured music of the Russian nationalist school. The concerts were hugely successful in popularizing Russian classical music of this kind in Europe, Rimsky- Korsakov's in particular. The following year, his opera Sadko was produced at the Paris Op√©ra and The Snow Maiden at the Op√©ra-Comique. He also had the opportunity to hear more recent music by European composers. He hissed unabashedly when he heard Richard Strauss's opera Salome, and told Diaghilev after hearing Claude Debussy's opera Pell√©as et M√©lisande, \\"Don't make me listen to all these horrors or I shall end up liking them!\\" Hearing these works led him to appreciate his place in the world of classical music. He admitted that he was a \\"convinced kuchkist\\" (after kuchka, the shortened Russian term for The Five) and that his works belonged to an era that musical trends had left behind. =Death= Beginning around 1890, Rimsky-Korsakov suffered from angina. While this ailment initially wore him down gradually, the stresses concurrent with the 1905 Revolution and its aftermath greatly accelerated its progress. After December 1907, his illness became severe, and he could not work.Rimsky-Korsakov, Preface xxiii. In 1908, he died at his Lubensk estate near Luga (modern day Plyussky District of Pskov Oblast), and was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg, next to Borodin, Glinka, Mussorgsky and Stasov. Compositions Portrait of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov by Valentin Serov (1898) Rimsky-Korsakov followed the musical ideals espoused by The Five. He employed Orthodox liturgical themes in the Russian Easter Festival Overture, folk song in Capriccio Espagnol and orientalism in Scheherazade, possibly his best known work.Maes, 175‚Äì176. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self- critical one. He revised every orchestral work up to and including his Third Symphony‚Äîsome, like Antar and Sadko, more than once.Abraham, Slavonic, 197. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale transposition and complete recomposition.Abraham, Slavonic, 197‚Äì98. Rimsky-Korsakov was open about the influences in his music, telling Vasily Yastrebtsev, \\"Study Liszt and Balakirev more closely, and you'll see that a great deal in me is not mine\\".Yastrebtsev, 37. He followed Balakirev in his use of the whole tone scale, treatment of folk songs and musical orientalism and Liszt for harmonic adventurousness. (The violin melody used to portray Scheherazade is very closely related to its counterpart in Balakirev's symphonic poem Tamara, while the Russian Easter Overtures follows the design and plan of Balakirev's Second Overture on Russian Themes.) Nevertheless, while he took Glinka and Liszt as his harmonic models, his use of whole tone and octatonic scales do demonstrate his originality. He developed both these compositional devices for the \\"fantastic\\" sections of his operas, which depicted magical or supernatural characters and events. Rimsky- Korsakov maintained an interest in harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career. He tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control. The more radical his harmonies became, the more he attempted to control them with strict rules‚Äîapplying his \\"musical conscience\\", as he called it. In this sense, he was both a progressive and a conservative composer.Maes, 180. The whole tone and octatonic scales were both considered adventurous in the Western classical tradition, and Rimsky-Korsakov's use of them made his harmonies seem radical. Conversely, his care about how or when in a composition he used these scales made him seem conservative compared with later composers like Igor Stravinsky, though they were often building on Rimsky-Korsakov's work.Maes, 180, 195. =Operas= While Rimsky-Korsakov is best known in the West for his orchestral works, his operas are more complex, offering a wider variety of orchestral effects than in his instrumental works and fine vocal writing. Excerpts and suites from them have proved as popular in the West as the purely orchestral works. The best-known of these excerpts is probably \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" from The Tale of Tsar Saltan, which has often been heard by itself in orchestral programs, and in countless arrangements and transcriptions, most famously in a piano version made by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff. Other selections familiar to listeners in the West are \\"Dance of the Tumblers\\" from The Snow Maiden, \\"Procession of the Nobles\\" from Mlada, and \\"Song of the Indian Guest\\" (or, less accurately, \\"Song of India\\") from Sadko, as well as suites from The Golden Cockerel and The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya. The Operas fall into three categories: * Historical drama: The Maid of Pskov, and its prologue The Noblewoman Vera Sheloga, Mozart and Salieri, The Tsar's Bride, Pan Voyevoda, Servilya * Folk operas: May Night, Christmas Eve * Fairy tales and legends: The Snow Maiden, Mlada, Sadko, Kashchey the Deathless, The Tale of Tsar Saltan, The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya, The Golden Cockerel Of this range Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in 1902, \\"In every new work of mine I am trying to do something that is new for me. On the one hand, I am pushed on by the thought that in this way, [my music] will retain freshness and interest, but at the same time I am prompted by my pride to think that many facets, devices, moods and styles, if not all, should be within my reach.\\" American music critic and journalist Harold C. Schonberg wrote that the operas \\"open up a delightful new world, the world of the Russian East, the world of supernaturalism and the exotic, the world of Slavic pantheism and vanished races. Genuine poetry suffuses them, and they are scored with brilliance and resource.\\"Schonberg, 364. According to some critics Rimsky-Korsakov's music in these works lacks dramatic power, a seemingly fatal flaw in an operatic composer. This may have been conscious, as he repeatedly stated in his writing that he felt operas were first and foremost musical works rather than mainly dramatic ones. Ironically, the operas succeed dramatically in most cases by being deliberately non-theatrical.Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:33. =Orchestral works= The purely orchestral works fall into two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly programmatic in nature‚Äîin other words, the musical content and how it is handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky- Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition. Opening themes of the Sultan and Scheherazade Program music came naturally to Rimsky-Korsakov. To him, \\"even a folk theme has a program of sorts.\\"Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 21:409. He composed the majority of his orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his career‚Äîat the beginning, with Sadko and Antar (also known as his Second Symphony, Op. 9), and in the 1880s, with Scheherazade, Capriccio Espagnol and the Russian Easter Overture. Despite the gap between these two periods, the composer's overall approach and the way he used his musical themes remained consistent. Both Antar and Scheherazade use a robust \\"Russian\\" theme to portray the male protagonists (the title character in Antar; the sultan in Scheherazade) and a more sinuous \\"Eastern\\" theme for the female ones (the peri Gul-Nazar in Antar and the title character in Scheherazade).Maes, 82, 175. Where Rimsky-Korsakov changed between these two sets of works was in orchestration. While his pieces were always celebrated for their imaginative use of instrumental forces, the sparser textures of Sadko and Antar pale compared to the luxuriance of the more popular works of the 1880s. While a principle of highlighting \\"primary hues\\" of instrumental color remained in place, it was augmented in the later works by a sophisticated cachet of orchestral effects, some gleaned from other composers including Wagner, but many invented by himself. As a result, these works resemble brightly colored mosaics, striking in their own right and often scored with a juxtaposition of pure orchestral groups. The final tutti of Scheherazade is a prime example of this scoring. The theme is assigned to trombones playing in unison, and is accompanied by a combination of string patterns. Meanwhile, another pattern alternates with chromatic scales in the woodwinds and a third pattern of rhythms is played by percussion.Abraham, New Grove (1980), 16:32‚Äì33. Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well- crafted, does not rise to the same level of inspiration as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to bring out the best in him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium. =Smaller-scale works= Rimsky-Korsakov composed dozens of art songs, arrangements of folk songs, chamber and piano music. While the piano music is relatively unimportant, many of the art songs possess a delicate beauty. While they yield in overt lyricism to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, otherwise they reserve their place in the standard repertory of Russian singers. Rimsky-Korsakov also wrote a body of choral works, both secular and for Russian Orthodox Church service. The latter include settings of portions of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (despite his own atheism).Abraham, The New Grove Russian Masters 2, 27.Abraham, Studies in Russian Music, 288Morrison, 116‚Äì17, 168‚Äì69. Legacy =Transitional figure= Critic Vladimir Stasov, who along with Balakirev had founded The Five, wrote in 1882, \\"Beginning with Glinka, all the best Russian musicians have been very skeptical of book learning and have never approached it with the servility and the superstitious reverence with which it is approached to this day in many parts of Europe.\\"As quoted in Taruskin, Stravinsky, 24. This statement was not true for Glinka, who studied Western music theory assiduously with Siegfried Dehn in Berlin before he composed his opera A Life for the Tsar.Maes, 19. It was true for Balakirev, who \\"opposed academicism with tremendous vigor,\\" and it was true initially for Rimsky-Korsakov, who had been imbued by Balakirev and Stasov with the same attitude.Maes, 38‚Äì39. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov by Emil Wiesel One point Stasov omitted purposely, which would have disproved his statement completely, was that at the time he wrote it, Rimsky-Korsakov had been pouring his \\"book learning\\" into students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory for over a decade.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 29. Beginning with his three years of self-imposed study, Rimsky-Korsakov had drawn closer to Tchaikovsky and further away from the rest of The Five, while the rest of The Five had drawn back from him and Stasov had branded him a \\"renegade\\". Taruskin writes, \\"The older he became, the greater was the irony with which Rimsky-Korsakov looked back on his kuchkist days.\\"Taruskin, Stravinsky, 32. When the young Semyon Kruglikov was considering a future in composition, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the future critic, > About a talent for composition ... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried > your powers too little ... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one > needs advice, but one must study ... All of us, that is, I myself and > Borodin, and Balakirev, and especially Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these > things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced > myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he > writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, > sloppily and often incoherently.As quoted in Taruskin, Stravinsky, 33. Taruskin points out this statement, which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote while Borodin and Mussorgsky were still alive, as proof of his estrangement from the rest of The Five and an indication of the kind of teacher he eventually became.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 34. By the time he instructed Liadov and Glazunov, \\"their training hardly differed from [Tchaikovsky's]. An ideal of the strictest professionalism was instilled in them from the beginning.\\" By the time Borodin died in 1887, the era of autodidactism for Russian composers had effectively ended. Every Russian who aspired to write classical music attended a conservatory and received the same formal education.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 40‚Äì41. \\"There was no more 'Moscow', no 'St. Petersburg'.\\" Taruskin writes; \\"at last all Russia was one. Moreover, by century's end, the theory and composition faculties of Rubinstein's Conservatory were entirely in the hands of representatives of the New Russian School. Viewed against the background of Stasov's predictions, there could scarcely be any greater irony.\\"Taruskin, Stravinsky, 41. =Students= Rimsky-Korsakov taught theory and composition to 250 students over his 35-year tenure at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, \\"enough to people a whole 'school' of composers\\". This does not include pupils at the two other schools where he taught, including Glazunov, or those he taught privately at his home, such as Igor Stravinsky.Taruskin, Stravinsky, 1:163. Apart from Glazunov and Stravinsky, students who later found fame included Anatoly Lyadov, Mikhail Ippolitov- Ivanov, Alexander Spendiaryan, Sergei Prokofiev, Ottorino Respighi, Witold Maliszewski, Mykola Lysenko, Artur Kapp, and Konstanty Gorski. Other students included the music critic and musicologist Alexander Ossovsky, and the composer Lazare Saminsky.Schonberg, 365. Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented students needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them in understanding the forms of composition; give them a year or two of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 34. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, \\"I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work.\\" Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. \\"Rimsky- Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well.\\"Malko, 49. =Editing the work of The Five= Rimsky- Korsakov's editing of works by The Five is significant. It was a practical extension of the collaborative atmosphere of The Five during the 1860s and 1870s, when they heard each other's compositions in progress and worked on them together, and was an effort to save works that would otherwise either have languished unheard or become lost entirely. This work included the completion of Alexander Borodin's opera Prince Igor, which Rimsky-Korsakov undertook with the help of Glazunov after Borodin's death, and the orchestration of passages from C√©sar Cui's William Ratcliff for its first production in 1869. He also completely orchestrated the opera The Stone Guest by Alexander Dargomyzhsky three times‚Äîin 1869‚Äì70, 1892 and 1902. While not a member of The Five himself, Dargomyzhsky was closely associated with the group and shared their musical philosophy. Fyodor Chaliapin was a powerful exponent of the Rimsky-Korsakov version of Boris Godunov, which launched the work in the world's opera houses, but has since fallen out of favor. Portrait by Aleksandr Golovin. Musicologist Francis Maes wrote that while Rimsky- Korsakov's efforts are laudable, they are also controversial. It was generally assumed that with Prince Igor, Rimsky-Korsakov edited and orchestrated the existing fragments of the opera while Glazunov composed and added missing parts, including most of the third act and the overture.Maes, 182.Taruskin, Music, 185. This was exactly what Rimsky-Korsakov stated in his memoirs.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 283. Both Maes and Richard Taruskin cite an analysis of Borodin's manuscripts by musicologist Pavel Lamm, which showed that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov discarded nearly 20 percent of Borodin's score.Maes, 182‚Äì83. According to Maes, the result is more a collaborative effort by all three composers than a true representation of Borodin's intent.Maes, 183. Lamm stated that because of the extremely chaotic state of Borodin's manuscripts, a modern alternative to Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov's edition would be extremely difficult to complete. More debatable, according to Maes, is Rimsky-Korsakov's editing of Mussorgsky's works. After Mussorgsky's death in 1881, Rimsky-Korsakov revised and completed several of Mussorgsky's works for publication and performance, helping to spread Mussorgsky's works throughout Russia and to the West. Maes, in reviewing Mussorgsky's scores, wrote that Rimsky-Korsakov allowed his \\"musical conscience\\" to dictate his editing, and he changed or removed what he considered musical over-experimentation or poor form. Because of this, Rimsky- Korsakov has been accused of pedantry in \\"correcting\\", among other things, matters of harmony. Rimsky-Korsakov may have foreseen questions over his efforts when he wrote, > If Mussorgsky's compositions are destined to live unfaded for fifty years > after their author's death (when all his works will become the property of > any and every publisher), such an archeologically accurate edition will > always be possible, as the manuscripts went to the Public Library on leaving > me. For the present, though, there was need of an edition for performances, > for practical artistic purposes, for making his colossal talent known, and > not for the mere studying of his personality and artistic sins.Rimsky- > Korsakov, My Musical Life, 249. Maes stated that time proved Rimsky-Korsakov correct when it came to posterity's re-evaluation of Mussorgsky's work. Mussorgsky's musical style, once considered unpolished, is now admired for its originality. While Rimsky- Korsakov's arrangement of Night on Bald Mountain is still the version generally performed, Rimsky-Korsakov's other revisions, like his version of Boris Godunov, have been replaced by Mussorgsky's original.Maes, 115. Folklore and pantheism Rimsky-Korsakov may have saved the most personal side of his creativity for his approach to Russian folklore. Folklorism as practiced by Balakirev and the other members of The Five had been based largely on the protyazhnaya dance song. Protyazhnaya literally meant \\"drawn- out song\\", or melismatically elaborated lyric song. The characteristics of this song exhibit extreme rhythmic flexibility, an asymmetrical phrase structure and tonal ambiguity.Maes, 65. After composing May Night, Rimsky- Korsakov was increasingly drawn to \\"calendar songs\\", which were written for specific ritual occasions. The ties to folk culture was what interested him most in folk music, even in his days with The Five; these songs formed a part of rural customs, echoed old Slavic paganism and the pantheistic world of folk rites. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that his interest in these songs was heightened by his study of them while compiling his folk song collections.Rimsky- Korsakov, My Musical Life, 165‚Äì66. He wrote that he \\"was captivated by the poetic side of the cult of sun-worship, and sought its survivals and echoes in both the tunes and the words of the songs. The pictures of the ancient pagan period and spirit loomed before me, as it then seemed, with great clarity, luring me on with the charm of antiquity. These occupations subsequently had a great influence in the direction of my own activity as a composer\\". Rimsky- Korsakov's interest in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of Alexander Afanasyev. That author's standard work, The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs, became Rimsky-Korsakov's pantheistic bible. The composer first applied Afanasyev's ideas in May Night, in which he helped fill out Gogol's story by using folk dances and calendar songs. He went further down this path in The Snow Maiden,Maes, 187. where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and khorovodi (ceremonial dances) in the folk tradition.Maes, 188. Musicologists and Slavicists have long recognized that Rimsky-Korsakov was an ecumenical artist whose folklore-inspired operas take up such issues as the relationship between paganism and Christianity and the seventeenth-century schism in the Orthodox Church.

They lived in Saint Petersburg, and collaborated from 1856 to 1870. The Five struggled to promote Russian music. History =Name= Vladimir Stasov (1824-1906) In May 1867 the critic Vladimir Stasov wrote an article, titled Mr. Balakirev's Slavic Concert, covering a concert that had been performed for visiting Slav delegations at the \\"All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition\\" in Moscow. The four Russian composers whose works were played at the concert were Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Dargomyzhsky, Mily Balakirev, and Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov.Abraham, Gerald, Essays on Russian and East European Music: Vladimir Stasov, Man and Critic, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985, pg. 112 The article ended with the following statement: The expression \\"mighty handful\\" (, Moguchaya kuchka, \\"Mighty Bunch\\") was mocked by enemies of Balakirev and Stasov: Aleksandr Serov, academic circles of the conservatory, the Russian Musical Society, and their press supporters. The group ignored critics and continued operating under the moniker. This loose collection of composers gathered around Balakirev now included Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin  the five who have come to be associated with the name \\"Mighty Handful\\", or sometimes \\"The Five\\". Gerald Abraham stated flatly in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians that \\"they never called themselves, nor were they ever called in Russia, 'The Five'\\"Abraham, Gerald, The New Grove: Russian Masters 1: Balakirev, New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1986, pg. 86 (although today the Russian equivalent \\"–ü—è—Ç—ë—Ä–∫–∞\\" (\\"Pyatyorka\\") is occasionally used to refer to this group).Krugosvet, \\"Balakirev Mily Alekseevich\\". In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov routinely refers to the group as \\"Balakirev's circle\\", and occasionally uses \\"The Mighty Handful\\", usually with an ironic tone. He also makes the following reference to \\"The Five\\": The Russian word kuchka also spawned the terms \\"kuchkism\\" and \\"kuchkist\\", which may be applied to artistic aims or works in tune with the sensibilities of the Mighty Handful. The name of Les Six, an even looser collection of French-speaking composers, emulates that of \\"The Five\\". =Formation= The formation of the group began in 1856 with the first meeting of Balakirev and C√©sar Cui. Modest Mussorgsky joined them in 1857, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1861, and Alexander Borodin in 1862. All the composers in The Five were young men in 1862. Balakirev was 25, Cui 27, Mussorgsky 23, Borodin the eldest at 28, and Rimsky-Korsakov just 18. They were all self-trained amateurs. Borodin combined composing with a career in chemistry. Rimsky-Korsakov was a naval officer (he wrote his First Symphony on a three-year naval voyage circumnavigating the globe). Mussorgsky had been in the prestigious Preobrazhensky Regiment of the Imperial Guard, and then in the civil service before taking up music; even at the height of his career in the 1870s he was forced by the expense of his drinking habit to hold down a full- time job in the State Forestry Department.Figes, Orlando, Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2002), 179. In contrast to the √©lite status and court connections of Conservatory composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, The Five were mainly from the minor gentry of the provinces. To some degree their esprit de corps depended on the myth, which they themselves created, of a movement that was more \\"authentically Russian,\\" in the sense that it was closer to the native soil, than the classic academy.Figes, 179. Also see R. Tarushkin, Defining Russia Musically, xiii ff, per Figes. Before them, Mikhail Glinka and Alexander Dargomyzhsky had gone some way towards producing a distinctly Russian kind of music, writing operas on Russian subjects, but the Mighty Handful represented the first concentrated attempt to develop such a music, with Stasov as their artistic adviser and Dargomyzhsky as an elder statesman to the group, so to speak. The circle began to fall apart during the 1870s, no doubt partially due to the fact that Balakirev withdrew from musical life early in the decade for a period of time. All of \\"The Five\\" are buried in Tikhvin Cemetery in Saint Petersburg. Musical language =Stylization= The musical language The Five developed set them far apart from the Conservatoire. This self-conscious Russian styling was based on two elements: *They tried to incorporate in their music what they heard in village songs, in Cossack and Caucasian dances, in church chants and the tolling of church bells (to the point where the bell tolling became a clich√©). The Five's music became filled with imitative sounds of Russian life. They also tried to reproduce the long-drawn, lyrical and melismatic peasant song, what Glinka had once called \\"the soul of Russian music.\\" Balakirev made this possible by his study of songs from the Volga in the 1860s. More than any previous anthology, his transcriptions artfully preserved the distinctive aspects of Russian folk music: Tonal mutability *:A tune seems to shift naturally from one tonal center to another, often ending up in a different key than the one in which the song began. This can produce a feeling of elusiveness, a lack of definition or of logical progression in the harmony. Even when stylized by The Five, this quality can make Russian music sound very different from the tonal structures of the West. Heterophony *:A melody is simultaneously rendered by two or more performers in different variations. This is improvised by the singers until the end, when the song reverts to a single melodic line. Parallel fifths, fourths, and thirds *:The effect lends Russian music a raw sonority missing entirely from the comparatively polished harmonies of Western music. *The Five also adopted a series of harmonic devices to create a distinct \\"Russian\\" style and color different from Western music. This \\"exotic\\" styling of \\"Russia\\" was not just self-conscious but entirely invented. None of these devices were actually used in Russian folk or church music: Whole tone scale *:Although Glinka did not invent this scale, his application of it in the opera Ruslan and Lyudmila (1842)  most recognizable at the end of the festive overture  provided a characteristic harmonic and melodic device. This scale in \\"Russian\\" works often suggests evil or ominous personages or situations. It was used by all the major composers from Tchaikovsky (the appearance of the Countess's ghost in The Queen of Spades) to Rimsky-Korsakov (in all his magic-story operas‚ÄîSadko, Kashchey the Deathless and The Invisible City of Kitezh). Claude Debussy also uses this scale in his music, taking this, among many things, from the Russians. Later it became a standard device in horror-movie scores. The Russian submediantDeVoto, Mark. \\"The Russian Submediant in the Nineteenth Century,\\" Current Musicology, no. 59 (October 1995), pp. 48-76. *:Also linked to Glinka's Ruslan, this is a harmonic pattern (in major mode) in which one upper part proceeds from the dominant pitch chromatically to the submediant while the other harmony parts remain constant. The most basic form of this pattern can be shown as follows (beginning with typical tonic): root-position tonic triad ‚Üí root-position augmented tonic triad ‚Üí 1st inversion submediant minor triad. A famous example of the Russian submediant occurs in the very opening bars of the third movement of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherezade. Diminished or octatonic scale *:Rimsky-Korsakov first used this in his symphonic poem Sadko in 1867. This scale became a sort of Russian calling-card  a leitmotif of magic and menace used not just by Rimsky-Korsakov but all of his followers, above all Alexander Scriabin, Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky and Olivier Messiaen (mode 2). Modular rotation in sequences of thirds *:The Five made this device of Franz Liszt their own to base a loose symphonic-poem type of structure. This way, they could avoid the rigid Western laws of modulation in sonata form, allowing the form of a musical composition to be shaped entirely by the \\"content\\" of the music (its programmatic statements and visual descriptions) rather than by formal laws of symmetry. This loose structure became especially important for Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, a work that may have done more than any other to define the Russian style.Figes, 180-181. Pentatonic scale *:This stylistic aspect became used by every Russian nationalist composer.Figes, 391. Its distinctive feature is to have only five notes in the octave, rather than the seven of the heptatonic scales (e.g., major and minor). The pentatonic scale is one of the ways of suggesting a \\"primitive\\" folk-melodic style as well as the \\"Eastern\\" element (Middle East, Asia). A melodic example of the \\"major-mode\\" pentatonic scale (C-D-E- G-A) can be heard at the entrance of the chorus at the beginning of Borodin's Prince Igor. =Orientalism= One hallmark of \\"The Five\\" was its reliance on orientalism.Figes, 391. Many quintessentially \\"Russian\\" works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev's Islamey, Borodin's Prince Igor and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade.Figes, 391. Orientalism, in fact, became widely considered in the West both one of the best-known aspects of Russian music and a trait of Russian national character.Maes, 80. As leader of \\"The Five,\\" Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their \\"Russian\\" music apart from the German symphonism of Anton Rubinstein and other Western-oriented composers.Figes, 391. Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his First Symphony, Stasov and the other nationalists dubbed it the \\"First Russian Symphony,\\" even though Rubinstein had written his Ocean Symphony a dozen years before it.Figes, 391. These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus.Figes, 391. \\"The symphony is good,\\" Cui wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. \\"We played it a few days ago at Balakirev's‚Äîto the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness.\\"Rimsky- Korsakov, A.N., N.A. Rimskii-Korsakov: zhizn' i tvorchestvo, vyp. 2 (Moscow, 1935), 31. Orientalism was not confined to using authentic Eastern melodies.Maes, Francis, tr. Pomerans, Arnold J. and Erica Pomerans, A History of Russian Music: From Kamarinskaya to Babi Yar (Berkeley, Los Angeles and London: University of California Press, 2002), 82. What became more important than the melodies themselves were the musical conventions added to them. These conventions allowed orientalism to become an avenue for writing music on subjects considered unmentionable otherwise, such as political themes and erotic fantasies.Maes, 80. It also became a means of expressing Russian supremacy as the empire expanded under Alexander II.Maes, 80. This was often reinforced through misogynist symbolism‚Äîthe rational, active and moral Western man versus the irrational, passive and immoral Eastern woman. Two major works entirely dominated by orientalism are Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite Antar and Balakirev's symphonic poem Tamara. Antar, set in Arabia, uses two different styles of music, Western (Russian) and Eastern (Arabian). The first theme, Antar's, is masculine and Russian in character. The second theme, feminine and oriental in melodic contour, belongs to the queen, Gul Nazar. Rimsky-Korsakov was able to soften the implicit misogyny to some extent. However, female sensuality does exert a paralyzing, ultimately destructive influence. With Gul Nazar extinguishing Antar's life in a final embrace, the woman overcomes the man. Balakirev gives a more overtly misogynistic view of oriental women in Tamara. He had originally planned to write a Caucasan dance called a lezginka, modeled on Glinka, for this work. However, he discovered a poem by Mikhail Lermontov about the beautiful Tamara, who lived in a tower alongside the gorge of Daryal.Maes, 83. She lured travelers and allowed them to enjoy a night of sensual delights, only to kill them and throw their bodies into the River Terek.Maes, 83. Balakirev uses two specific codes endemic to orientalism in writing Tamara. The first code, based on obsessive rhythms, note repetitions, climactic effects and accelerated tempi, represents Dionysian intoxication. The second code, consisting of unpredictable rhythms, irregular phrasing and based on long passages with many repeat notes, augmented and diminished intervals and extended melismas, depict sensual longing. Not only did Balakirev use these codes extensively, but he also attempted to supercharge them further when he revised the orchestration of Tamara in 1898.Maes, 83. Quotations Rimsky-Korsakov provides the following picture of \\"The Mighty Handful\\" in his memoirs, Chronicle of My Musical Life (translated by J. A. Joffe): =Tastes= =Balakirev= =Abilities= Influence Except perhaps for Cui, the members of this group influenced or taught many of the great Russian composers who were to follow, including Alexander Glazunov, Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Dmitri Shostakovich. They also influenced the two French symbolist composers Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy through their radical tonal language.

They are also known as LZ1 and LZ2 respectively. These two algorithms form the basis for many variations including LZW, LZSS, LZMA and others. Besides their academic influence, these algorithms formed the basis of several ubiquitous compression schemes, including GIF and the DEFLATE algorithm used in PNG and ZIP. They are both theoretically dictionary coders. LZ77 maintains a sliding window during compression. This was later shown to be equivalent to the explicit dictionary constructed by LZ78however, they are only equivalent when the entire data is intended to be decompressed. Since LZ77 encodes and decodes from a sliding window over previously seen characters, decompression must always start at the beginning of the input. Conceptually, LZ78 decompression could allow random access to the input if the entire dictionary were known in advance. However, in practice the dictionary is created during encoding and decoding by creating a new phrase whenever a token is output. The algorithms were named an IEEE Milestone in 2004. Theoretical efficiency In the second of the two papers that introduced these algorithms they are analyzed as encoders defined by finite-state machines. A measure analogous to information entropy is developed for individual sequences (as opposed to probabilistic ensembles). This measure gives a bound on the data compression ratio that can be achieved. It is then shown that there exist finite lossless encoders for every sequence that achieve this bound as the length of the sequence grows to infinity. In this sense an algorithm based on this scheme produces asymptotically optimal encodings. This result can be proven more directly, as for example in notes by Peter Shor. LZ77 LZ77 algorithms achieve compression by replacing repeated occurrences of data with references to a single copy of that data existing earlier in the uncompressed data stream. A match is encoded by a pair of numbers called a length-distance pair, which is equivalent to the statement \\"each of the next length characters is equal to the characters exactly distance characters behind it in the uncompressed stream\\". (The distance is sometimes called the offset instead.) To spot matches, the encoder must keep track of some amount of the most recent data, such as the last 2 kB, 4 kB, or 32 kB. The structure in which this data is held is called a sliding window, which is why LZ77 is sometimes called sliding-window compression. The encoder needs to keep this data to look for matches, and the decoder needs to keep this data to interpret the matches the encoder refers to. The larger the sliding window is, the longer back the encoder may search for creating references. It is not only acceptable but frequently useful to allow length- distance pairs to specify a length that actually exceeds the distance. As a copy command, this is puzzling: \\"Go back four characters and copy ten characters from that position into the current position\\". How can ten characters be copied over when only four of them are actually in the buffer? Tackling one byte at a time, there is no problem serving this request, because as a byte is copied over, it may be fed again as input to the copy command. When the copy-from position makes it to the initial destination position, it is consequently fed data that was pasted from the beginning of the copy-from position. The operation is thus equivalent to the statement \\"copy the data you were given and repetitively paste it until it fits\\". As this type of pair repeats a single copy of data multiple times, it can be used to incorporate a flexible and easy form of run-length encoding. Another way to see things is as follows: While encoding, for the search pointer to continue finding matched pairs past the end of the search window, all characters from the first match at offset D and forward to the end of the search window must have matched input, and these are the (previously seen) characters that comprise a single run unit of length LR, which must equal D. Then as the search pointer proceeds past the search window and forward, as far as the run pattern repeats in the input, the search and input pointers will be in sync and match characters until the run pattern is interrupted. Then L characters have been matched in total, L > D, and the code is [D, L, c]. Upon decoding [D, L, c], again, D = LR. When the first LR characters are read to the output, this corresponds to a single run unit appended to the output buffer. At this point, the read pointer could be thought of as only needing to return int(L/LR) + (1 if L mod LR ‚â† 0) times to the start of that single buffered run unit, read LR characters (or maybe fewer on the last return), and repeat until a total of L characters are read. But mirroring the encoding process, since the pattern is repetitive, the read pointer need only trail in sync with the write pointer by a fixed distance equal to the run length LR until L characters have been copied to output in total. Considering the above, especially if the compression of data runs is expected to predominate, the window search should begin at the end of the window and proceed backwards, since run patterns, if they exist, will be found first and allow the search to terminate, absolutely if the current maximal matching sequence length is met, or judiciously, if a sufficient length is met, and finally for the simple possibility that the data is more recent and may correlate better with the next input. =Pseudocode= The pseudocode is a reproduction of the LZ77 compression algorithm sliding window. while input is not empty do prefix := longest prefix of input that begins in window if prefix exists then i := distance to start of prefix l := length of prefix c := char following prefix in input else i := 0 l := 0 c := first char of input end if output (i, l, c) s := pop l + 1 chars from front of input discard l + 1 chars from front of window append s to back of window repeat =Implementations= Even though all LZ77 algorithms work by definition on the same basic principle, they can vary widely in how they encode their compressed data to vary the numerical ranges of a length‚Äìdistance pair, alter the number of bits consumed for a length‚Äìdistance pair, and distinguish their length‚Äìdistance pairs from literals (raw data encoded as itself, rather than as part of a length‚Äìdistance pair). A few examples: * The algorithm illustrated in Lempel and Ziv's original 1977 article outputs all its data three values at a time: the length and distance of the longest match found in the buffer, and the literal that followed that match. If two successive characters in the input stream could be encoded only as literals, the length of the length‚Äìdistance pair would be 0. * LZSS improves on LZ77 by using a 1-bit flag to indicate whether the next chunk of data is a literal or a length‚Äìdistance pair, and using literals if a length‚Äìdistance pair would be longer. * In the PalmDoc format, a length‚Äìdistance pair is always encoded by a two-byte sequence. Of the 16 bits that make up these two bytes, 11 bits go to encoding the distance, 3 go to encoding the length, and the remaining two are used to make sure the decoder can identify the first byte as the beginning of such a two-byte sequence. * In the implementation used for many games by Electronic Arts, the size in bytes of a length‚Äìdistance pair can be specified inside the first byte of the length‚Äìdistance pair itself; depending on whether the first byte begins with a 0, 10, 110, or 111 (when read in big-endian bit orientation), the length of the entire length‚Äìdistance pair can be 1 to 4 bytes. * , the most popular LZ77-based compression method is DEFLATE; it combines LZSS with Huffman coding. Literals, lengths, and a symbol to indicate the end of the current block of data are all placed together into one alphabet. Distances can be safely placed into a separate alphabet; because a distance only occurs just after a length, it cannot be mistaken for another kind of symbol or vice versa. LZ78 LZ78 algorithms achieve compression by replacing repeated occurrences of data with references to a dictionary that is built based on the input data stream. Each dictionary entry is of the form \`dictionary[...] = {index, character}\`, where index is the index to a previous dictionary entry, and character is appended to the string represented by . For example, \\"abc\\" would be stored (in reverse order) as follows: \`dictionary[k] = {j, 'c'}, dictionary[j] = {i, 'b'}, dictionary[i] = {0, 'a'}\`, where an index of 0 specifies the first character of a string. The algorithm initializes last matching index = 0 and next available index = 1. For each character of the input stream, the dictionary is searched for a match: {last matching index, character}. If a match is found, then last matching index is set to the index of the matching entry, and nothing is output. If a match is not found, then a new dictionary entry is created: dictionary[next available index] = {last matching index, character}, and the algorithm outputs last matching index, followed by character, then resets last matching index = 0 and increments next available index. Once the dictionary is full, no more entries are added. When the end of the input stream is reached, the algorithm outputs last matching index. Note that strings are stored in the dictionary in reverse order, which an LZ78 decoder will have to deal with. LZW is an LZ78-based algorithm that uses a dictionary pre-initialized with all possible characters (symbols) or emulation of a pre-initialized dictionary. The main improvement of LZW is that when a match is not found, the current input stream character is assumed to be the first character of an existing string in the dictionary (since the dictionary is initialized with all possible characters), so only the last matching index is output (which may be the pre-initialized dictionary index corresponding to the previous (or the initial) input character). Refer to the LZW article for implementation details. BTLZ is an LZ78-based algorithm that was developed for use in real-time communications systems (originally modems) and standardized by CCITT/ITU as V.42bis. When the trie-structured dictionary is full, a simple re-use/recovery algorithm is used to ensure that the dictionary can keep adapting to changing data. A counter cycles through the dictionary. When a new entry is needed, the counter steps through the dictionary until a leaf node is found (a node with no dependents). This is deleted and the space re-used for the new entry. This is simpler to implement than LRU or LFU and achieves equivalent performance.

It got its name from the Bailiff of 's-Hertogenbosch, which administered the area in the name of the Dukes of Brabant. The Meierij roughly corresponds to the somewhat larger Dutch province of North Brabant. The capital city of North Brabant and the most important city of the bailiwick is 's-Hertogenbosch (Dutch for 'the Duke's Forest'), also known as Den Bosch ('The Forest') or Bois-le-Duc (French name). Other parts of the bailiwick are the so-called Vier Kwartieren (four quarters): * Oisterwijk Kwartier (with main city Oisterwijk) * Kempenland (with main city Oirschot and later Eindhoven) * Peelland (with main city Sint Oedenrode) * Maasland Kwartier (with main city Oss) In the northeast of the bailiwick there were some free lands which were also connected to the Meierij: * Land of Cuijk * County of Megen * Land of Ravenstein * Barony of Boxmeer * Territory Gemert (belonging to the Teutonic order) * Land of Bokhoven In the south, the nowadays Belgian town of Lommel belonged to the bailiwick, while the village of Luyksgestel belonged to the Prince-bishopric of Li√®ge. In 1807 these areas were exchanged.  Landscape  The Bailiwick of 's-Hertogenbosch consists mainly of the poor sandy grounds of the Peel and Kempen. Those areas, which in old times were not densely populated, consisted of enormous heaths and marshlands, interrupted by woods and fenlands. In the north and east the area is surrounded by the river Maas. Numerous little rivers rise in the high sand areas and find their way to the rivers Aa and Dommel. Both rivers come together in the marshlands around 's-Hertogenbosch where they form the river Dieze that ends up in the Maas. Since the Middle Ages the waste lands of Peel and Kempen have been cultivated. Only small parts of the once enormous heaths and marshlands have survived until modern times. In the first part of the 19th century the rivers Aa and Dommel were cultivated but nowadays they have gone back to their old run for the purpose of nature development. Legal re-division of land forms a major threat for the cultural and historical aspects of landscape at the moment.  History  Historically the Meierij is the descendant of Taxandria, when that area comes under the rule of the dukes of Brabant in the 12th century. To protect the area from the counts of Gelre, the dukes founded a new ring of cities. Hendrik I of Brabant granted city rights to 's-Hertogenbosch (), Oisterwijk (1213 or 1230), Sint-Oedenrode (1232) and Eindhoven (1232). However, despite these foundings, the Meierij often suffered from conflicts and wars between Brabant and Gelre. The bailiwick was prosperous in the 15th and first part of the 16th century. In these times many new monumental buildings were built (like the famous gothic style St. Jan's Cathedral of 's-Hertogenbosch), the activities of well-known painter Hieronymus Bosch (also called Jeroen Bosch) and the Latin school of 's-Hertogenbosch. In the Eighty Years' War, times turned bad for the Meierij. The area was literally a battlefield and was heavily plagued by continuous raids. Around 1590 the area was solidly in Spanish hands. Like the southern Dutch states of Flanders and Hainaut, the Duchy Brabant-Limburg had chosen the side of the Catholic Habsburg monarchs of Spain. The strong catholic Counter-Reformation had had much influence on the population's mentality and culture; the Bailiwick remained Catholic. Though it was thought impossible, the mighty city of 's-Hertogenbosch was captured by the Dutch Protestants in 1629. As 's-Hertogenbosch was the main capital of the Meierij, the Protestants considered the bailiwick as their possession. However the Spanish kings refused to give it up, and thus one of the most difficult times started, the so-called \\"retorsie tijd\\" in which the population suffered from both Spanish and Dutch oppression. Finally in 1648 the whole bailiwick was given to the Dutch republic at the Peace of Westphalia. From now the former Brabant and Limburg areas were placed under the reign of the generality as well as Zeelandic Flanders which had been taken from Flanders. Reign of the generality in fact meant nothing else than oppression and colonisation by the Protestants. There was no self-government and Catholicism was forbidden, which resulted in a flight of the Catholic clergy and occupation of the Catholic churches. Due to high taxes and oppression the bailiwick couldn't restore its old glory and became an intensely poor area without any importance. After the French war of 1795 and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic, the Meierij disappeared as s political unity and went up into Brabant. The people regained their old rights; self-government and Catholicism weren't forbidden any longer. Since 1810 the area has been part of the province of North Brabant and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Nowadays the area is still known as Meierij and is still mostly cultural Catholic. The population is considered to have a ‚ÄúBurgundian character‚Äù by the other Dutch, meaning that they are supposed to be companiable people who like to party exuberantly. (The term recalls the time of Burgundian rule over the Netherlands.) Around 1900 the area got an enormous growth of population when a combination of reviving Catholicism and economic recovery caused high birthrates. Eindhoven, Tilburg and Helmond developed into major industrial centres. At the moment the area is again highly developing its industries (especially in Eindhoven and the surrounding region), and is one of the most prosperous areas of the Netherlands and Northwest Europe.

It was designed by Phil Katz, for version 2 of his PKZIP archiving tool. Deflate was later specified in RFC 1951 (1996). Katz also designed the original algorithm used to construct Deflate streams. This algorithm was patented as , and assigned to PKWARE, Inc. As stated in the RFC document, an algorithm producing Deflate files was widely thought to be implementable in a manner not covered by patents. This led to its widespread use, for example in gzip compressed files and PNG image files, in addition to the ZIP file format for which Katz originally designed it. The patent has since expired.  Stream format  A Deflate stream consists of a series of blocks. Each block is preceded by a 3-bit header: * First bit: Last- block-in-stream marker:  \`1\`: This is the last block in the stream.  \`0\`: There are more blocks to process after this one. * Second and third bits: Encoding method used for this block type:  \`00\`: A stored (a.k.a. raw or literal) section, between 0 and 65,535 bytes in length  \`01\`: A static Huffman compressed block, using a pre-agreed Huffman tree defined in the RFC  \`10\`: A compressed block complete with the Huffman table supplied  \`11\`: Reserved‚Äîdon't use. The stored block option adds minimal overhead, and is used for data that is incompressible. Most compressible data will end up being encoded using method \`10\`, the dynamic Huffman encoding, which produces an optimised Huffman tree customised for each block of data individually. Instructions to generate the necessary Huffman tree immediately follow the block header. The static Huffman option is used for short messages, where the fixed saving gained by omitting the tree outweighs the percentage compression loss due to using a non-optimal (thus, not technically Huffman) code. Compression is achieved through two steps: * The matching and replacement of duplicate strings with pointers. * Replacing symbols with new, weighted symbols based on frequency of use. = Duplicate string elimination = Within compressed blocks, if a duplicate series of bytes is spotted (a repeated string), then a back-reference is inserted, linking to the previous location of that identical string instead. An encoded match to an earlier string consists of an 8-bit length (3‚Äì258 bytes) and a 15-bit distance (1‚Äì32,768 bytes) to the beginning of the duplicate. Relative back-references can be made across any number of blocks, as long as the distance appears within the last 32 KiB of uncompressed data decoded (termed the sliding window). If the distance is less than the length, the duplicate overlaps itself, indicating repetition. For example, a run of 10 identical bytes can be encoded as one byte, followed by a duplicate of length 9, beginning with the previous byte. Searching the preceding text for duplicate substrings is the most computationally expensive part of the DEFLATE algorithm, and the operation which compression level settings affect. = Bit reduction = The second compression stage consists of replacing commonly used symbols with shorter representations and less commonly used symbols with longer representations. The method used is Huffman coding which creates an unprefixed tree of non- overlapping intervals, where the length of each sequence is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the probability of that symbol needing to be encoded. The more likely it is that a symbol has to be encoded, the shorter its bit-sequence will be. A tree is created, containing space for 288 symbols: * 0‚Äì255: represent the literal bytes/symbols 0‚Äì255. * 256: end of block ‚Äì stop processing if last block, otherwise start processing next block. * 257‚Äì285: combined with extra-bits, a match length of 3‚Äì258 bytes. * 286, 287: not used, reserved and illegal but still part of the tree. A match length code will always be followed by a distance code. Based on the distance code read, further \\"extra\\" bits may be read in order to produce the final distance. The distance tree contains space for 32 symbols: * 0‚Äì3: distances 1‚Äì4 * 4‚Äì5: distances 5‚Äì8, 1 extra bit * 6‚Äì7: distances 9‚Äì16, 2 extra bits * 8‚Äì9: distances 17‚Äì32, 3 extra bits * ... * 26‚Äì27: distances 8,193‚Äì16,384, 12 extra bits * 28‚Äì29: distances 16,385‚Äì32,768, 13 extra bits * 30‚Äì31: not used, reserved and illegal but still part of the tree. Note that for the match distance symbols 2‚Äì29, the number of extra bits can be calculated as \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor-1. The two codes (the 288-symbol length/literal tree and the 32-symbol distance tree) are themselves encoded as canonical Huffman codes by giving the bit length of the code for each symbol. The bit lengths are themselves run-length encoded to produce as compact a representation as possible. As an alternative to including the tree representation, the \\"static tree\\" option provides standard fixed Huffman trees. The compressed size using the static trees can be computed using the same statistics (the number of times each symbol appears) as are used to generate the dynamic trees, so it is easy for a compressor to choose whichever is smaller.  Encoder/compressor  During the compression stage, it is the encoder that chooses the amount of time spent looking for matching strings. The zlib/gzip reference implementation allows the user to select from a sliding scale of likely resulting compression-level vs. speed of encoding. Options range from \`0\` (do not attempt compression, just store uncompressed) to \`9\` representing the maximum capability of the reference implementation in zlib/gzip. Other Deflate encoders have been produced, all of which will also produce a compatible bitstream capable of being decompressed by any existing Deflate decoder. Differing implementations will likely produce variations on the final encoded bit-stream produced. The focus with non-zlib versions of an encoder has normally been to produce a more efficiently compressed and smaller encoded stream. = Deflate64/Enhanced Deflate = Deflate64, specified by PKWARE, is a proprietary variant of Deflate. It's fundamentally the same algorithm. What has changed is the increase in dictionary size from 32 KB to 64 KB, an extension of the distance codes to 16 bits so that they may address a range of 64 KB, and the length code, which is extended to 16 bits so that it may define lengths of three to 65,538 bytes. This leads to Deflate64 having a longer compression time, and potentially a slightly higher compression ratio, than Deflate. Several free and/or open source projects support Deflate64, such as 7-Zip,7-Zip Manual and Documentation ‚Äì compression Method while others, such as zlib, do not, as a result of the proprietary nature of the procedureHistory of Lossless Data Compression Algorithms ‚Äì Deflate64 and the very modest performance increase over Deflate.zlib FAQ ‚Äì Does zlib support the new \\"Deflate64\\" format introduced by PKWare?  Using Deflate in new software  Implementations of Deflate are freely available in many languages. C programs typically use the zlib library (licensed under the zlib License, which allows use with both free and proprietary software). Programs written using the Borland dialects of Pascal can use paszlib; a C++ library is included as part of 7-Zip/AdvanceCOMP. Java includes support as part of the standard library (in java.util.zip). Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 base class library supports it in the System.IO.Compression namespace. Programs in Ada can use Zip-Ada (pure) or the ZLib-Ada thick binding to zlib. = Encoder implementations = * PKZIP: the first implementation, originally done by Phil Katz as part of PKZip. * zlib/gzip: standard reference implementation used in a huge amount of software, owing to public availability of the source code and a license allowing inclusion into other software. * Crypto++: contains a public domain implementation in C++ aimed mainly at reducing potential security vulnerabilities. The author, Wei Dai states \\"This code is less clever, but hopefully more understandable and maintainable [than zlib]\\". * 7-Zip/AdvanceCOMP: written by Igor Pavlov in C++, this version is freely licensed and tends to achieve higher compression than zlib at the expense of CPU usage.

Useful for compressing genomic data. AdvanceCOMP uses the higher compression ratio version of Deflate as implemented by 7-Zip (or optionally Zopfli in recent versions) to enable recompression of gzip, PNG, MNG and ZIP files with the possibility of achieving smaller file sizes than zlib is able to at maximum settings. = Hardware encoders = * AHA361-PCIX/AHA362-PCIX from Comtech AHA. Comtech produced a PCI-X card (PCI-ID: \`193f:0001\`) capable of compressing streams using Deflate at a rate of up to 3.0 Gbit/s (375 MB/s) for incoming uncompressed data. Accompanying the Linux kernel driver for the AHA361-PCIX is an \\"\`ahagzip\`\\" utility and customised \\"\`mod_deflate_aha\`\\" capable of using the hardware compression from Apache. The hardware is based on a Xilinx Virtex FPGA and four custom AHA3601 ASICs. The AHA361/AHA362 boards are limited to only handling static Huffman blocks and require software to be modified to add support ‚Äî the cards were not able to support the full Deflate specification, meaning they could only reliably decode their own output (a stream that did not contain any dynamic Huffman type 2 blocks). * StorCompress 300/MX3 from Indra Networks. This is a range of PCI (PCI-ID: \`17b4:0011\`) or PCI-X cards featuring between one and six compression engines with claimed processing speeds of up to 3.6 Gbit/s (450 MB/s). A version of the cards are available with the separate brand WebEnhance specifically designed for web-serving use rather than SAN or backup use; a PCIe revision, the MX4E is also produced. * AHA363-PCIe/AHA364-PCIe/AHA367-PCIe. In 2008, Comtech started producing two PCIe cards (\`PCI-ID: 193f:0363\`/\`193f:0364\`) with a new hardware AHA3610 encoder chip. The new chip was designed to be capable of a sustained 2.5 Gbit/s. Using two of these chips, the AHA363-PCIe board can process Deflate at a rate of up to 5.0 Gbit/s (625 MB/s) using the two channels (two compression and two decompression). The AHA364-PCIe variant is an encode-only version of the card designed for out-going load balancers and instead has multiple register sets to allow 32 independent virtual compression channels feeding two physical compression engines. Linux, Microsoft Windows, and OpenSolaris kernel device drivers are available for both of the new cards, along with a modified zlib system library so that dynamically linked applications can automatically use the hardware support without internal modification. The AHA367-PCIe board (\`PCI-ID: 193f:0367\`) is similar to the AHA363-PCIe but uses four AHA3610 chips for a sustained compression rate of 10 Gbit/s (1250 MB/s). Unlike the AHA362-PCIX, the decompression engines on the AHA363-PCIe and AHA367-PCIe boards are fully deflate compliant. * Nitrox and Octeon processors from Cavium, Inc. contain high-speed hardware deflate and inflate engines compatible with both ZLIB and GZIP with some devices able to handle multiple simultaneous data streams. * HDL-Deflate GPL FPGA implementation. * Intel Communications Chipset 89xx Series (Cave Creek) for the Intel Xeon E5-2600 and E5-2400 Processor Series (Sandy Bridge-EP/EN) supports hardware compression and decompression using QuickAssist Technology.

He was the first to write history in Latin. His epithet \\"Elder\\" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar. He came from an ancient Plebeian family who were noted for their military service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to agriculture when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome and began to follow the cursus honorum: he was successively military tribune (214 BC), quaestor (204 BC), aedile (199 BC), praetor (198 BC), consul (195 BC) together with Flaccus, and censor (184 BC). As praetor, he expelled usurers from Sardinia. As censor, he tried to save Rome's ancestral customs and combat \\"degenerate\\" Hellenistic influences. Biography The theatre at Tusculum Cato the Elder was born in the municipal town of Tusculum, like some generations of his ancestors. His father had earned a reputation as a brave soldier, and his great-grandfather had received a reward from the state for having had five horses killed under him in battle. However, the Tusculan Porcii had never obtained the privileges of the Roman magistracy. Cato the Elder, their famous descendant, at the beginning of his career in Rome, was regarded as a novus homo (new man), and the feeling of his unsatisfactory position, working along with the belief of his inherent superiority, aggravated and drove his ambition. Early in life, he so far exceeded the previous deeds of his predecessors that he is frequently spoken of not only as the leader, but as the founder of the Porcia gens. =Cognomen Cato= His ancestors for three generations had been named Marcus Porcius, and it was said by Plutarch that at first he was known by the additional cognomen Priscus, but was afterwards called Catoa word indicating 'common sense that is the result of natural wisdom combined with experience'.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder, 1. Priscus, like Major, may have been merely an epithet used to distinguish him from the later Cato of Utica. There is no precise information as to when he first received the title of Cato, which may have been given in childhood as a symbol of distinction. The qualities implied in the word Cato were acknowledged by the plainer and less outdated title of Sapiens, by which he was so well known in his old age, that Cicero says, it became his virtual cognomen.Cicero, Laelius On Friendship, 2. From the number and eloquence of his speeches, he was a gifted orator,Justinus, xxxiii. 2Gellius, xvii. 21. but Cato the Censor (Cato Censorius), and Cato the Elder are now his most common, as well as his most characteristic names, since he carried out the office of Censor with extraordinary standing and was the only Cato who ever held it. =Deducing Cato's date of birth= The date of Cato's birth has to be deduced from conflicting reports of his age at the time of his death, which is known to have happened in 149 BC. According to the chronology of Cicero, Cato was born in 234 BC, in the year before the first Consulship of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, and died at the age of 85, in the consulship of Lucius Marcius Censorinus and Manius Manilius. PlinyPliny, Natural History, xxix. 8. agrees with Cicero. Other authors exaggerate the age of Cato. According to Valerius MaximusValerius Maximus, viii. 7. ¬ß 1. he survived his 86th year, according to LivyLivy, History of Rome, xxxix. 40. and PlutarchPlutarch, Life of Cato the Elder, 15. he was 90 years old when he died. These exaggerated ages, however, are inconsistent with a statement of Cato himself that is recorded by Plutarch. =Youth= On the Punic Wars Hannibal and his men crossing the Alps When Cato was very young, after his father's death, he inherited a small property in the Sabine territory, at a distance from his native town. There, he spent most of his childhood overseeing the operations of the farm, learning business and the rural economy. Near this land was a small hut owned by Manius Curius Dentatus, whose military feats and rigidly simple character were remembered and admired in the neighborhood. Cato was inspired to imitate that character, hoping to match the glory of Dentatus. Soon, an opportunity came for a military campaign in 217 BC, during the Second Punic War against Hannibal Barca. Experts express some disagreement about Cato's early military life. In 214 BC, he served at Capua, and the historian Wilhelm Drumann imagines that already, at the age of 20, he was a military tribune.Wilhelm Drumann, Geschichte Roms (History of Rome), v. p. 99, 6 Bde. K√∂nigsberg 1834‚Äì1844. Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus had the command in this area, Campania, during the year of his fourth consulship. At the siege of Tarentum, 209 BC, Cato was again at the side of Fabius. Two years later, Cato was one of the group who went with the consul Claudius Nero on his northern march from Lucania to check the progress of Hasdrubal Barca. It is recorded that the services of Cato contributed to the decisive and important victory of Sena at the Battle of the Metaurus, where Hasdrubal was slain. He later gave several vehement speeches which he often ended by saying \\"Carthago delenda est\\", or \\"Carthage must be destroyed.\\"Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder, 27. Between the wars In the pauses between campaigns Cato returned to his Sabine farm, where he dressed simply, working and behaving like his laborers. Young as he was, the neighboring farmers liked his tough mode of living, enjoyed his old-fashioned and concise proverbs, and had a high regard for his abilities. His own active personality made him willing and eager to make himself available in the service of his neighbors. He was selected to act, sometimes as an arbitrator of disputes, and sometimes as a supporter in local causes, which were probably tried in front of recuperatores (the judges for causes of great public interest). Consequently, he was enabled to strengthen by practice his oratorical abilities, to gain self-confidence, to observe the manners of men, to analyze the diversity of human nature, to apply the rules of law, and to practically investigate the principles of justice. Follower of the old Roman strictness In the area surrounding Cato's Sabine farm were the lands of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, a young nobleman of significant influence and high patrician family. Flaccus could not help remarking on Cato's energy, his military talent, his eloquence, his frugal and simple life, and his traditional principles. Flaccus himself was a member of that purist patrician faction which displayed its adherence to the stricter virtues of the Roman character. Within Roman society a transition was in progress ‚Äîfrom Samnite rusticity to Grecian civilization and oriental luxuriance. The chief magistracies of the state had become almost hereditary for a few wealthy and upper-class families. They were popular by acts of generosity and charming manners, and they collected material wealth from their clients and followers, as well as intellectual prowess provided by their education, taste in the fine arts, and knowledge of literature. Nonetheless, the less fortunate nobles, envious of this exclusive oligarchy, and critical of the decadence and luxury, formed a party with a more conservative and ascetic ideology. In their eyes, rusticity and austerity were the marks of Sabine character, and of the old Roman inflexible integrity and love of order. Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Scipio Africanus and his family, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, may be taken as representative of the new culture; Cato's friends, Fabius and Flaccus, were the leading men in the faction defending the old plainness. Path to magistracies Septimius Severus. Flaccus was a perceptive politician, who looked for young and emergent men to support him. He had observed Cato's martial spirit and heard his eloquent tongue. He knew how much courage and persuasiveness were valued at Rome. He also knew that distinction achieved on the battlefield opened the way to achievements in the higher civil offices. Finally, Flaccus knew too that for a stranger like Cato, the only way to the magisterial honors was success in the Roman Forum. For that reason, he suggested to Cato that he shift his ambition to the field of Roman politics. The advice was followed. Invited to the townhouse of Flaccus, and ratified by his support, Cato began to distinguish himself in the forum, and became a candidate for assuming a post in the magistracy. =Early military career= Quaestor In 205 BC, Cato was appointed Quaestor, and in the next year (204 BC) he entered upon the duties of his place of work, following Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major to Sicily. When Scipio, after much opposition, obtained from the senate permission to transport armed forces from Sicily to Africa, Cato and Gaius Laelius were appointed to escort the baggage ships. Yet there proved not to be the friendliness of cooperation between Cato and Scipio which ought to have existed between a quaestor and his proconsul. Fabius had opposed the permission given to Scipio to carry the attack to the enemy's home, and Cato, whose appointment was intended to monitor Scipio's behavior, adopted the views of his friend. Plutarch reports that the lenient discipline of the troops under Scipio's command and the exaggerated expenses incurred by the general provoked Cato's protests, such that Scipio, immediately afterward, replied angrily, saying he would give an account of victories, not of money. Cato left his place of duty after the dispute with Scipio about the latter's alleged extravagance, and returning to Rome, condemned the uneconomical activities of his general to the senate. Plutarch went on to say that at the joint request of Cato and Fabius, a commission of tribunes was sent to Sicily to examine Scipio's activity. Upon their review of his extensive and careful arrangements for the transport of the troops, they determined he was not guilty of Cato's charges.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder, 3. Plutarch's version, which would seem to attribute to Cato the wrongdoing of quitting his post before his time, is barely consistent with Livy's narrative. If Livy is correct, the commission was sent because of the complaints of the inhabitants of Locri, who had been harshly oppressed by Quintus Pleminius, Scipio's legate. Livy says nothing of Cato's interference in this matter, but mentions the bitterness with which Fabius blamed Scipio for corrupting military discipline and for having illegally left his province to take the town of Locri.Livy, History of Rome, xxix. 19, etc. The author of the abridged life of Cato, commonly considered the work of Cornelius Nepos, asserts that Cato, after his return from Africa, put in at Sardinia, and brought the poet Quintus Ennius in his own ship from the island to Italy. But because Sardinia is rather out of the line of the trip to Rome, it is more likely that the first contact between Ennius and Cato happened at a later date, when the latter was praetor in Sardinia.Aurelius Victor, On famous Roman men, 47. Aedile and praetor In 199 BC Cato was chosen aedile, and with his colleague Helvius, restored the Plebeian Games, and gave upon that occasion a banquet in honor of Jupiter. In 198 BC he was made praetor, and obtained Sardinia as his province, with the command of 3,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. Here he took the earliest opportunity to demonstrate his main beliefs by practicing his strict public morality. He reduced official operating costs, walked his trips with a single assistant, and placed his own frugality in contrast with the opulence of provincial magistrates. The rites of religion were celebrated with thrift, justice was administered with strict impartiality, and usury was severely punished. According to Aurelius Victor, a revolt in Sardinia was subdued by Cato during his praetorship. =Consul= Enactment of the Porcian Laws In 195 BC, when he was only 39 years old, Cato was elected junior consul to his old friend and patron Flaccus. During his consulship, he enacted the first two of the Porcian Laws, which expanded the protections of Roman citizens against degrading or capricious punishment under the Republic's Valerian Law. Repeal of the Oppian Law In 215 BC, at the height of the Second Punic War and at the request of the tribune of the plebs Gaius Oppius, the Oppian Law (Lex Oppia), intended to restrict the luxury and extravagance of women in order to save money for the public treasury, was passed. The law specified that no woman could own more than half an ounce of gold, nor wear a garment of several colours, nor drive a carriage with horses closer than a mile to the city, except to attend public celebrations of religious rites. After Hannibal was defeated and Rome was resplendent with Carthaginian wealth, tribunes Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius proposed to abolish the Oppian law, but tribunes Marcus Junius Brutus and Titus Junius Brutus opposed doing so. This conflict spawned far more interest than the most important state affairs. Middle-aged married Roman women crowded the streets, blocked access to the forum, and intercepted their approaching husbands, demanding to restore the traditional ornaments of Roman matrons. They even begged the praetors, consuls and other magistrates. Even Flaccus hesitated, but his colleague Cato was inflexible, and made a characteristically impolite speech, which was later retold by Livy.Livy, History of Rome, xxxiv. 1, 8. Finally, the dissenting tribunes withdrew their opposition and the Oppian law was repealed by vote of all tribes. Women went in procession through the streets and the forum, dressed up with their now legitimate finery.Valerius Maximus, ix. 1. ¬ß3. Just after this controversy had been settled, Cato, who had maintained a severe and determined firm opposition, seems to have suffered no very real damage to his popularity. He soon set sail for his appointed province, Hispania Citerior. Post in Hispania Citerior In his campaign in Hispania, Cato behaved in keeping with his reputation of untiring hard work and alertness. He lived soberly, sharing the food and the labours of the common soldier. Wherever it was possible, he personally superintended the execution of his orders. His movements were reported as bold and rapid, and he always pushed for victory. His operations appear to have been carefully designed, and were coordinated with the plans of other generals in other parts of Hispania. His manoeuvres were considered original and successful. He managed to benefit by setting tribe against tribe, and took native mercenaries into his pay. Hispania in 197 BC The details of the campaign, as related by Livy,Livy, History of Rome, book xxxiv. and illustrated by incidental anecdotes by Plutarch, are full of horror and they make clear that Cato reduced Hispania Citerior to subjection with great speed and little mercy. We read of multitudes who put themselves to death because of the dishonour after they had been stripped of all their arms, of extensive massacres of surrendered troops, and the frequent harsh plunders. The phrase bellum se ipsum alet ‚Äîthe war feeds itself‚Äî was coined by Cato during this period. His conduct in Hispania were not contradictory with the traditional ideals of a Roman soldier, or with his own firm and over-assertive temper. He claimed to have destroyed more towns in Hispania than he had spent days in that country. Roman triumph After he reduced the area between the River Iberus and the Pyrenees to a resentful and, as it turned out, temporary obedience, Cato turned his attention to administrative reforms, and increased the revenues of the province by improvements in the working of the iron and silver mines. For his achievements in Hispania, the senate decreed a thanksgiving ceremony of three days. In the course of the year 194 BC, he returned to Rome and was rewarded with the honor of a Roman triumph, at which he exhibited an extraordinary quantity of captured brass, silver, and gold, both coin and ingots. Cato distributed the monetary prize to his soldiery, and was more liberal than might have been expected from his vigorous parsimony.Livy, History of Rome, xxxiv. 46. End of consulship The return of Cato seems to have accelerated the enmity of Scipio Africanus, who was Consul in 194 BC and is said to have desired the command of the province in which Cato was harvesting notoriety. There is some disagreement between Nepos (or the pseudo-Nepos), and Plutarch,Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder, 11. in their accounts of this topic. Nepos claims that Scipio failed to obtain the province, and, offended by the rejection, remained after his consulship in a private capacity at Rome. Plutarch claims that Scipio, who was disgusted by Cato's severity, was appointed to succeed him but could not convince the senate to censure Cato's administration, and passed his consulship in inactivity. Plutarch was probably mistaken, judging by the statement in Livy,Livy, History of Rome, xxxiv. 43. that in 194 BC, Sextus Digitius was appointed to the province of Hispania Citerior. The notion that Scipio was appointed successor to Cato in Hispania may have arisen from a double confusion of name and place, since Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica was chosen in 194 BC to the province of Hispania Ulterior. However true this account, Cato used his eloquence and produced detailed financial accounts to successfully defend against criticism of his consulship. The known fragments of the speeches (or one speech under different names) made after his return attest to the strength of his arguments. PlutarchPlutarch, Cato the Elder, 12. states that, after his Consulship, Cato accompanied Tiberius Sempronius Longus as legatus to Thrace, but this seems incorrect because, although Scipio Africanus believed that one Consul should have Macedonia, Sempronius was soon in Cisalpine Gaul,Livy, History of Rome, xxxiv. 43, 46. and in 193 BC Cato was in Rome dedicating a small temple to Victoria Virgo.Livy, History of Rome, xxxv. 9. =Late military career= Battle of Thermopylae The military career of Cato was not yet ended. In 191 BC, he, along with his old associate Lucius Valerius Flaccus, was appointed as a lieutenant-general (legatus)under the Consul Manius Acilius Glabrio, who had been dispatched to Greece to oppose the invasion of Antiochus III the Great, King of the Seleucid Empire. In the decisive Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC), which led to the downfall of Antiochus, Cato behaved with his usual valor, and enjoyed good fortune. By a daring and difficult advance, he surprised and removed a body of the enemy's Aetolian auxiliaries, who were posted upon the Callidromus, the highest peak of the range of Mount Oeta. Then, coming to the aid of forces under Flaccus's command, he began a sudden descent from the hills above the royal camp, and the panic caused by this unexpected movement promptly turned the day in favor of the Romans, and signaled the end of the Seleucid invasion of Greece. After the action, the consul hugged Cato with the greatest warmth and attributed to him the whole credit of the victory. That this is a fact rests on the authority of Cato himself, who, like Cicero, often indulged in the habit, offensive to modern taste, of sounding his own praises. After an interval spent in the pursuit of Antiochus and the pacification of Greece, Cato was sent to Rome by the Consul Glabrio to announce the successful outcome of the campaign, and he performed his journey with such celerity that he had started his report in the senate before the return of Lucius Cornelius Scipio, the later conqueror of Antiochus, who had been sent off from Greece a few days before him.Livy, History of Rome, xxxvi. 17‚Äì21. Doubtful visit to Athens During the campaign in Greece under Glabrio, Plutarch's account (albeit rejected by historian Wilhelm Drumann) suggests that before the Battle of Thermopylae, Cato was chosen to prevent Corinth, Patrae, and Aegium from siding with Antiochus. During this period, Cato visited Athens where, in trying to prevent the Athenians from listening to the propositions of the Seleucid king, Cato addressed them in a Latin speech, which required an interpreter to be understood by the audience. Whether this was out of necessity or merely a choice by Cato remains unclear, however, since the assertion that he might very well have already known Greek at the time can be made from anecdotal evidence. For example, Plutarch said that while at Tarentum in his youth he had developed a close friendship with Nearchus, who was himself a Greek philosopher. Similarly, Aurelius Victor stated he had received instruction in Greek from Ennius while praetor in Sardinia. Nevertheless, because his speech was an affair of state, it is probable that he complied with the Roman norms of the day in using the Latin language while practicing diplomacy, which was considered as a mark of Roman dignity.Valerius Maximus, ii, 2. ¬ß 2. =Influence in Rome= His reputation as a soldier was now established; henceforth he preferred to serve the state at home, scrutinizing the conduct of the candidates for public honours and of generals in the field. If he was not personally engaged in the prosecution of the Scipiones (Africanus and Asiaticus) for corruption, it was his spirit that animated the attack upon them. Even Scipio Africanus‚Äîwho refused to reply to the charge, saying only, \\"Romans, this is the day on which I conquered Hannibal\\" and was absolved by acclamation‚Äîfound it necessary to retire, self- banished, to his villa at Liternum. Cato's enmity dated from the African campaign when he quarreled with Scipio for his lavish distribution of the spoil among the troops, and his general luxury and extravagance. Cato was also opposed to the spread of Hellenic culture, which he believed threatened to destroy the rugged simplicity of the conventional Roman type. It was during this censorship that his determination to oppose Hellenism was most strongly exhibited, and hence, the behavior from which was derived the title (censor) by which he is most generally distinguished. He revised with unsparing severity the lists of senators and knights, ejecting from either order the men whom he judged unworthy of membership, either on moral grounds or on the basis of their lack of the prescribed means. The expulsion of L. Quinctius Flamininus for wanton cruelty was an example of his rigid justice. His regulations against luxury were very stringent. He imposed a heavy tax upon dress and personal adornment, especially of women, and upon young slaves purchased as favourites. In 181 BC he supported the lex Orchia (according to others, he first opposed its introduction, and subsequently its repeal), which prescribed a limit to the number of guests at an entertainment, and in 169 BC the lex Voconia, one of the provisions of which was intended to limit the accumulation of what Cato considered an undue amount of wealth in the hands of women. =Public works= Among other things he repaired the aqueducts, cleansed the sewers, and prevented private persons drawing off public water for their own use. The Aqua Appia was the first aqueduct of Rome. It was constructed in 312 BC by Appius Claudius Caecus, the same Roman censor who also built the important Via Appia. Unauthorised plumbing into Rome's aqueducts had always been a problem, as Frontinus records much later. Cato also ordered the demolition of houses which encroached on the public way, and built the first basilica in the Forum near the Curia (Livy, History, 39.44; Plutarch, Marcus Cato, 19). He raised the amount paid by the publicani for the right to collect taxes and, at the same time, reduced the contract prices for the construction of public works. =Later years= From the date of his censorship (184 BC) to his death in 149 BC, Cato held no public office, but continued to distinguish himself in the Senate as the persistent opponent of the new ideas. He was struck with horror, along with many other Romans, at the licence of the Bacchanalian mysteries, which he attributed to the influence of Greek manners, and he vehemently urged the dismissal of the philosophers Carneades, Diogenes, and Critolaus, who had come as ambassadors from Athens, on account of what he believed was the dangerous nature of their ideas. He also uttered warnings against the influence of Chaldean astrologers who had entered Italy along with Greek culture.Astrology, Catholic Encyclopaedia He had a horror of physicians, who were chiefly Greeks. He obtained the release of Polybius, the historian, and his fellow prisoners, contemptuously asking whether the Senate had nothing more important to do than discuss whether a few Greeks should die at Rome or in their own land. It was not until his eightieth year that he made his first acquaintance with Greek literature, though some think after examining his writings that he may have had a knowledge of Greek works for much of his life. In his last years, he was known for strenuously urging his countrymen to prosecute the Third Punic War and to destroy Carthage. In 157 BC, he was one of the deputies sent to Carthage to arbitrate between the Carthaginians and Massinissa, king of Numidia. The mission was unsuccessful and the commissioners returned home, but Cato was so struck by Carthage's growing prosperity that he was convinced that the security of Rome depended on its annihilation. From that time, he began concluding his speeches ‚Äîon any topic whatsoever‚Äî with the cry, \\"moreover, I advise that Carthage must be destroyed\\" ('). Other times, \\"Carthage must be destroyed\\" was put more compactly as ' or '. Cicero's dialogue Cato the Elder on Old Age also depicted Cato's antipathy to Carthage. According to Ben Kiernan, Cato may have made the first recorded incitement to genocide. To Cato the individual life was a continual discipline, and public life was the discipline of the many. He regarded the individual householder as the germ of the family, the family as the germ of the state. By strict economy of time he accomplished an immense amount of work; he demanded his dependents practice a similar dedication, and proved himself a hard husband, a strict father, and a severe and cruel master. There was little difference, apparently, in the esteem in which he held his wife and his slaves, although perhaps his pride caused him to take a warmer interest in his sons, Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus and Marcus Porcius Cato Salonianus. To the Romans themselves little in this behavior seemed worthy of censure, it was respected rather as a traditional example of the old Roman manners. In the remarkable passage in which Livy describes the character of Cato, there is no word of blame for the rigid discipline of his household.{{citation last=Livy author-link=Livy url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216165027/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer- new2?id=Liv5His.sgm&images;=images%2Fmodeng&data;=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&tag;=public‚àÇ=367&division;=div2 title=xxxix. 40 Writings Italian translation of De re rustica (1794) Cato was and remains famous as an author as well. He was a historian, the first Latin prose writer of any importance, and the first author of a history of Italy in Latin. Some have argued that if it were not for the impact of Cato's writing, Latin might have been supplanted by Greek as the literary language of Rome. He was also one of the very few early Latin authors who could claim Latin as a native language.. * His manual on running a farm (De Agri Cultura or \\"On Agriculture\\") (c. 160 BC) is his only work that survives completely. It is a miscellaneous collection of rules of husbandry and management, including sidelights on country life in the 2nd century BC. Adopted by many as a textbook at a time when Romans were expanding their agricultural activities into larger scale and more specialized business ventures geared towards profitability, De Agri Cultura assumes a farm run and staffed by slaves. Cato advises on hiring gangs for the olive harvest,Cato, De Agri Cultura ch. 64-68. and was noted for his chilling advice on keeping slaves continually at work, on reducing rations for slaves when sick, and on selling slaves that are old or sickly.Cato, De Agri Cultura ch. 2. Intended for reading aloud and discussing with farm workers, De Agri Cultura was widely read and much quoted (sometimes inaccurately) by later Latin authors.. Cato the Elder ranked the vineyard as the most important aspect when judging a farm. This was because of the profitability of the wine trade during that time. Grain pastures were ranked sixth due to the grain crisis.E.M. Jellinek, \\"Drinking and Alcohilics in Ancient Rome\\". Journal of Studies on Alcohol. Vol 7, No 11, 1976. * The Origines in seven books (BC) related the history of the Italian towns with special attention to Rome, from their legendary or historical foundation to his own day. Written to teach Romans what it means to be Roman and used to teach his own son how to read, Cato the Elder wrote ab urbe condita (from the founding of the city), and the early history is filled with legends illustrating Roman virtues. The Origines also spoke of how not only Rome, but the other Italian towns were venerable, and claimed the Romans were indeed superior to the Greeks. As it avoided using consular dating, it was not cited much by other historians and is mostly lost,. although it was a source for Virgil's Aeneid and is referenced by other writers including Cicero.. * Under the Roman Empire a collection of about 150 political speeches by Cato existed. In these he pursued his political policies, fought verbal vendettas, and opposed what he saw as Rome's moral decline. Not even the titles of all of these speeches are now known, but fragments of some of them are preserved. The first to which we can give a date was On the Improper Election of the Aediles, delivered in 202 BC. The collection included several speeches from the year of his consulship, followed by a self-justifying retrospect On His Consulship and by numerous speeches delivered when he was Censor. It is not clear whether Cato allowed others to read and copy his written texts (in other words, whether he \\"published\\" the speeches) or whether their circulation in written form began after his death.; . * On Soldiery was perhaps a practical manual comparable to On Farming.. This work is considered lost * On the Law Relating to Priests and Augurs was a topic that would follow naturally from some of the sections of On Farming. Only one brief extract from this work is known.. * Praecepta ad Filium, \\"Maxims addressed to his son,\\". from which the following extract survives: * Carmen de moribus (\\"Poem on morality\\"), apparently in prose in spite of the title.. * A collection of Sayings, some of them translated from Greek. The two surviving collections of proverbs known as the Distichs of Cato and the Monosticha Catonis probably belong to the 4th century AD and are not works of Cato the Elder. Legacy The wrinkle ridge system Dorsa Cato on the Moon is named after Cato. The comune of Monte Porzio Catone, one of the Castelli Romani and close to the ruins of Tusculum, is named in honor of the Porcius Cato family. Cato is portrayed by Vittorio Gassman in Scipione detto anche l'Africano, a 1971 Italian film starring Marcello Mastroianni as Scipio Africanus. =Family tree= See also *Ancient Rome and wine ‚Äì with details on Cato's influences on Roman viticulture and winemaking *Otium *Horatii *Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus *Marcus Atilius Regulus *Publius Decius Mus *Roman Agriculture *Pliny the Elder Notes References =Citations= =Bibliography=    This entry incorporates public domain text originally from: William Smith (ed.), Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, 1870.

Cyrus Hall McCormick (February 15, 1809 ‚Äì May 13, 1884) was an American inventor and businessman who founded the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, which later became part of the International Harvester Company in 1902. Originally from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, he and many members of the McCormick family became prominent residents of Chicago. McCormick has been simplistically credited as the single inventor of the mechanical reaper. He was, however, one of several designing engineers who produced successful models in the 1830s. His efforts built on more than two decades of work by his father Robert McCormick Jr., as well as the aid of Jo Anderson, a person enslaved by his family. He also successfully developed a modern company, with manufacturing, marketing, and a sales force to market his products. Early life and career Cyrus McCormick was born on February 15, 1809 in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. He was the eldest of eight children born to inventor Robert McCormick Jr. (1780‚Äì1846) and Mary Ann \\"Polly\\" Hall (1780‚Äì1853). As Cyrus' father saw the potential of the design for a mechanical reaper, he applied for a patent to claim it as his own invention. He worked for 28 years on a horse-drawn mechanical reaper to harvest grain; he was never able to reproduce a reliable version, however. Cyrus took up the project. He was aided by Jo Anderson, an enslaved African American on the McCormick plantation at the time. A few machines based on a design of Patrick Bell of Scotland (which had not been patented) were available in the United States in these years. The Bell machine was pushed by horses. The McCormick design was pulled by horses and cut the grain to one side of the team. Cyrus McCormick held one of his first demonstrations of mechanical reaping at the nearby village of Steeles Tavern, Virginia in 1831. He claimed to have developed a final version of the reaper in 18 months. The young McCormick was granted a patent on the reaper on June 21, 1834, two years after having been granted a patent for a self-sharpening plow.http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Cyrus_Hall_McCormick.aspx None was sold, however, because the machine could not handle varying conditions. The McCormick family also worked together in a blacksmith/metal smelting business. The panic of 1837 almost caused the family to go into bankruptcy when a partner pulled out. In 1839 McCormick started doing more public demonstrations of the reaper, but local farmers still thought the machine was unreliable. He did sell one in 1840, but none for 1841. Using the endorsement of his father's first customer for a machine built by McPhetrich, Cyrus continuously attempted to improve the design. He finally sold seven reapers in 1842, 29 in 1843, and 50 in 1844. They were all built manually in the family farm shop. He received a second patent for reaper improvements on January 31, 1845. Sketch of 1845 model reaper As word spread about the reaper, McCormick noticed orders arriving from farther west, where farms tended to be larger and the land flatter. While he was in Washington, D.C. to get his 1845 patent, he heard about a factory in Brockport, New York, where he contracted to have the machines mass-produced. He also licensed several others across the country to build the reaper, but their quality often proved poor, which hurt the product's reputation. Move to Chicago In 1847, after their father's death, Cyrus and his brother Leander (1819‚Äì1900) moved to Chicago, where they established a factory to build their machines. At the time, other cities in the midwestern United States, such as Cleveland, Ohio, St. Louis, Missouri, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, were more established and prosperous. Chicago had no paved streets at the time, but the city had the best water transportation from the east over the Great Lakes for his raw materials, as well as railroad connections to the farther west where his customers would be. When McCormick tried to renew his patent in 1848, the U.S. Patent Office noted that a similar machine had already been patented by Obed Hussey a few months earlier. McCormick claimed he had really invented his machine in 1831, but the renewal was denied. William Manning of Plainfield, New Jersey had also received a patent for his reaper in May 1831, but at the time, Manning was evidently not defending his patent. McCormick's brother William (1815‚Äì1865) moved to Chicago in 1849, and joined the company to take care of financial affairs. The McCormick reaper sold well, partially as a result of savvy and innovative business practices. Their products came onto the market just as the development of railroads offered wide distribution to distant markets. McCormick developed marketing and sales techniques, developing a wide network of salesmen trained to demonstrate operation of the machines in the field, as well as to get parts quickly and repair machines in the field if necessary during crucial times in the farm year. A company advertisement was a take-off of the Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way mural by Emanuel Leutze; it added to the title: \\"with McCormick Reapers in the Van.\\" In 1851, McCormick traveled to London to display a reaper at the Crystal Palace Exhibition. After his machine successfully harvested a field of green wheat while the Hussey machine failed, he won a gold medal and was admitted to the Legion of Honor. His celebration was short-lived after he learned that he had lost a court challenge to Hussey's patent. Legal controversies and success Another McCormick Company competitor was John Henry Manny of Rockford, Illinois. After the Manny Reaper beat the McCormick version at the Paris Exposition of 1855, McCormick filed a lawsuit against Manny for patent infringement. McCormick demanded that Manny stop producing reapers, and pay McCormick $400,000. The trial, originally scheduled for Chicago in September 1855, featured prominent lawyers on both sides. McCormick hired the former U.S. Attorney General Reverdy Johnson and New York patent attorney Edward Nicholl Dickerson. Manny hired George Harding and Edwin M. Stanton. Because the trial was set to take place in Illinois, Harding hired the local Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln. The trial was moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, however. Manny won the case, with an opinion by the State Supreme Court Judge John McLean. U.S. District Court of Ohio record Lincoln did not contribute to the defense. Stanton had objected to Lincoln's presence, referring to him as \\"that damned long armed ape.\\" After later being elected President, Lincoln chose Stanton as his Secretary of War. reaper and twine binder in 1884 In 1856, McCormick's factory was producing more than 4000 reapers each year, mostly sold in the Midwest and West. In 1861, however, Hussey's patent was extended but McCormick's was not. McCormick's outspoken opposition to Lincoln and the anti-slavery Republican party may not have helped his cause. McCormick decided to seek help from the U.S. Congress to protect his patent. In 1871, the factory burned down in the Great Chicago Fire, but McCormick heeded his wife's advice to rebuild, and it reopened in 1873 even as McCormick's health declined, so she took a greater role in the family's business as well as philanthropic affairs. In 1879, brother Leander changed the company's name from \\"Cyrus H. McCormick and Brothers\\" to \\"McCormick Harvesting Machine Company\\". He wanted to acknowledge the contributions of others in the family to the reaper \\"invention\\" and company, especially their father. Family relationships On January 26, 1858, 49-year-old Cyrus McCormick married his secretary Nancy \\"Nettie\\" Fowler (1835‚Äì1923). She was an orphan from New York who had graduated from the Troy Female Seminary and moved to Chicago. They had met two years earlier and shared views about business, religion and Democratic party politics.http://liberty-virtue-independence.blogspot.com/2011/11/cyrus-and- nettie-mccormick.html They had seven children: # Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr. was born May 16, 1859. # Mary Virginia McCormick was born May 5, 1861. # Robert McCormick III was born October 5, 1863 and died January 6, 1865. # Anita McCormick was born July 4, 1866, married Emmons Blaine on September 26, 1889, and died February 12, 1954. Emmons was a son of the U.S. Secretary of State James G. Blaine. # Alice McCormick was born March 15, 1870 and died less than a year later on January 25, 1871. # Harold Fowler McCormick was born May 2, 1872, married Edith Rockefeller, and died in 1941. Edith was the youngest daughter of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman. # Stanley Robert McCormick was born November 2, 1874, married Katharine Dexter (1875‚Äì1967), and died January 19, 1947. Mary and Stanley both suffered from schizophrenia. Stanley McCormick's life inspired the 1998 novel Riven Rock by T. Coraghessan Boyle. Cyrus McCormick was an uncle of Robert Sanderson McCormick (son-in-law of Joseph Medill); granduncle of Joseph Medill McCormick and Robert Rutherford McCormick; and great-granduncle of William McCormick Blair Jr. Activism McCormick had always been a devout Presbyterian, as well as advocate of Christian unity. He also valued and demonstrated in his life the Calvinist traits of self-denial, sobriety, thriftiness, efficiency, and morality. He believed feeding the world, made easier by the reaper, was part of his religious mission in life. A lifelong Democrat, before the American Civil War, McCormick had published editorials in his newspapers, The Chicago Times and Herald, calling for reconciliation between the national sections. His views, however, were unpopular in his adopted home town. Although his invention helped feed Union troops, McCormick believed the Confederacy would not be defeated and he and his wife traveled extensively in Europe during the war. McCormick unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Democrat for Illinois's 2nd congressional district with a peace-now platform in 1864, and was soundly defeated by Republican John Wentworth. He also proposed a peace plan to include a Board of Arbitration. After the war, McCormick helped found the Mississippi Valley Society, with a mission to promote New Orleans and Mississippi ports for European trade. He also supported efforts to annex Santa Domingo into the United States. Beginning in 1872, McCormick served a four-year term on the Illinois Democratic Party's Central Committee. McCormick later proposed an international mechanism to control food production and distribution. McCormick also became the principal benefactor and a trustee of what had been the Theological Seminary of the Northwest, which moved to Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood in 1859, a year in which he endowed four professorships. The institution was renamed McCormick Theological Seminary in 1886, after his death, although it moved to Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood in 1975 and began sharing facilities with the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago. In 1869, McCormick donated $10,000 to help Dwight L. Moody start YMCA, and his son Cyrus Jr. would become the first chairman of the Moody Bible Institute. McCormick and later his widow, Nettie Day McCormick, also donated significant sums to Tusculum College, a Presbyterian institution in Tennessee, as well as to establish churches and Sunday Schools in the South after the war, even though that region was slow to adopt his farm machinery and improved practices. Also, in 1872, McCormick purchased a religious newspaper, the Interior, which he renamed the Continent and became a leading Presbyterian periodical. For the last 20 years of his life, McCormick was a benefactor and member of the board of trustees at Washington and Lee University in his native Virginia. His brother Leander also donated funds to build an observatory on Mount Jefferson, operated by the University of Virginia and named the McCormick Observatory. Later life and death During the last four years of his life, McCormick became an invalid, after a stroke paralyzed his legs; he was unable to walk during his final two years. He died at home in Chicago on May 13, 1884. He was buried in Graceland Cemetery. He was survived by his widow, Nettie, who continued his Christian and charitable activities, within the United States and abroad, between 1890 and her death in 1923, donating $8 million (over $160 million in modern equivalents) to hospitals, disaster and relief agencies, churches, youth activities and educational institutions, and becoming the leading benefactress of Presbyterian Church activities in that era. Official leadership of the company passed to his eldest son Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr., but his grandson Cyrus McCormick III ran the company. Four years later, the company's labor practices (paying workers $9 per week) led to the Haymarket riots. Ultimately Cyrus Jr. teamed with J.P. Morgan to create the International Harvester Corporation in 1902. After Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr., Harold Fowler McCormick ran International Harvester. Various members of the McCormick family continued involvement with the corporation until Brooks McCormick, who died in 2006. Legacy and honors Numerous prizes and medals were awarded McCormick for his reaper, which reduced human labor on farms while increasing productivity. Thus, it contributed to the industrialization of agriculture as well as migration of labor to cities in numerous wheat- growing countries (36 by McCormick's death). The French government named McCormick an Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1851, and he was elected a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1878 \\"as having done more for the cause of agriculture than any other living man.\\" The Wisconsin Historical Society holds Cyrus McCormick's papers. * The Cyrus McCormick Farm, operated by other family members after Cyrus and Leander moved to Chicago, was ultimately donated to Virginia Tech, which operates the core of the property as a free museum, and other sections as an experimental farm. A marker memorializing Cyrus McCormick's contribution to agriculture had been erected near the main house in 1928. * A statue of McCormick was erected on the front campus of Washington and Lee University, at Lexington, Virginia. * The town of McCormick, South Carolina and McCormick County in the state were named for him after he bought a gold mine in the town, formerly known as Dornsville. * 1975, McCormick was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. * 3 cent U.S. postage stamps were issued in 1940 to commemorate Cyrus Hall McCormick.

Through the classical influence on modern culture, tasks that are both laborious and futile are therefore described as Sisyphean ().  Etymology  Linguistics Professor R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a pre-Greek origin and a connection with the root of the word ' (œÉŒøœÜœåœÇ, \\"wise\\").R. S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. xxxiii. German mythographer Otto Gruppe thought that the name derived from ' (œÉŒØœÉœÖœÇ, \\"a goat's skin\\"), in reference to a rain-charm in which goats' skins were used.Gruppe, O. Griechische Mythologie (1906), ii., p. 1021  Family  Sisyphus was the son of King Aeolus of Thessaly and EnaretePseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, 1.7.3 and the brother of Salmoneus. He married the Pleiad Merope by whom he became the father of Glaucus, Ornytion, Thersander, Almus and Porphyrion.Scholia, on Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 3.1553 Sisyphus was the grandfather of Bellerophon through Glaucus,Pseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, 1.9.3Homer, Iliad VI 152ff and Minyas, founder of Orchomenus, through Almus.  Mythology  = Reign = Sisyphus was the founder and first king of Ephyra (supposedly the original name of Corinth). King Sisyphus promoted navigation and commerce but was avaricious and deceitful. He also killed travellers and guests to his palace, a violation of xenia, which fell under Zeus' domain, thus angering the god. He took pleasure in these killings because they allowed him to maintain his iron-fisted rule. = Conflict with Salmoneus = Sisyphus and his brother Salmoneus were known to hate each other, and Sisyphus consulted the Oracle of Delphi on just how to kill Salmoneus without incurring any severe consequences for himself. From Homer onward, Sisyphus was famed as the craftiest of men. He seduced Salmoneus's daughter Tyro in one of his plots to kill Salmoneus, only for Tyro to slay the children she bore him when she discovered that Sisyphus was planning on using them eventually to dethrone her father. = Cheating death = King Sisyphus also betrayed one of Zeus's secrets by revealing the whereabouts of Aegina, an Asopid who was taken away by Zeus, to her father, the river god Asopus, in return for causing a spring to flow on the Corinthian acropolis. Zeus then ordered Death (in Greek, Thanatos) to chain King Sisyphus down below in Tartarus. Sisyphus was curious as to why Charon, whose job it was to guide souls to the Underworld, had not appeared on this occasion. King Sisyphus slyly asked Thanatos to demonstrate how the chains worked. As Thanatos was granting him his wish, Sisyphus seized the opportunity and trapped Thanatos in the chains instead. Once Thanatos was bound by the strong chains, no one died on Earth. This caused an uproar especially for Ares (who was annoyed that his battles had lost their fun because his opponents would not die), and so he intervened. The exasperated Ares freed Thanatos and turned King Sisyphus over to him. In another version, Hades was sent to chain Sisyphus and was chained himself. As long as Hades was tied up, nobody could die. Because of this, sacrifices could not be made to the gods, and those that were old and sick were suffering. The gods finally threatened to make life so miserable for Sisyphus that he would wish he were dead. He then had no choice but to release Hades. Before King Sisyphus died, he had told his wife to throw his naked body into the middle of the public square (purportedly as a test of his wife's love for him). This caused King Sisyphus to end up on the shores of the river Styx. Then, complaining to Persephone, goddess of the Underworld, that this was a sign of his wife's disrespect for him, King Sisyphus persuaded her to allow him to return to the upper world. Once back in Ephyra, the spirit of King Sisyphus scolded his wife for not burying his body and giving it a proper funeral (as a loving wife should). When King Sisyphus refused to return to the Underworld, he was forcibly dragged back there by Hermes. In another version of the myth, Persephone was tricked by Sisyphus that he had been conducted to Tartarus by mistake, and so she ordered that he be released.Bernard Evslin's gods, Demigods & Demons, 209‚Äì210 In Philoctetes by Sophocles, there is a reference to the father of Odysseus (rumoured to have been Sisyphus, and not La√´rtes, whom we know as the father in the Odyssey) upon having returned from the dead. Euripides, in Cyclops, also identifies Sisyphus as Odysseus' father. = Punishment in the Underworld = As a punishment for his trickery, Hades made King Sisyphus roll a huge boulder endlessly up a steep hill.Odyssey, xi. 593 The maddening nature of the punishment was reserved for King Sisyphus due to his hubristic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself. Hades accordingly displayed his own cleverness by enchanting the boulder into rolling away from King Sisyphus before he reached the top, which ended up consigning Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration. Thus it came to pass that pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as Sisyphean. King Sisyphus was a common subject for ancient writers and was depicted by the painter Polygnotus on the walls of the Lesche at Delphi.Pausanias x. 31 Interpretations Johann Vogel: Meditationes emblematicae de restaurata pace Germaniae, 1649 According to the solar theory, King Sisyphus is the disk of the sun that rises every day in the east and then sinks into the west. Other scholars regard him as a personification of waves rising and falling, or of the treacherous sea. The 1st-century BC Epicurean philosopher Lucretius interprets the myth of Sisyphus as personifying politicians aspiring for political office who are constantly defeated, with the quest for power, in itself an \\"empty thing\\", being likened to rolling the boulder up the hill.De Rerum Natura III Friedrich Welcker suggested that he symbolises the vain struggle of man in the pursuit of knowledge, and Salomon ReinachRevue arch√©ologique, 1904 that his punishment is based on a picture in which Sisyphus was represented rolling a huge stone Acrocorinthus, symbolic of the labour and skill involved in the building of the Sisypheum. Albert Camus, in his 1942 essay The Myth of Sisyphus, saw Sisyphus as personifying the absurdity of human life, but Camus concludes \\"one must imagine Sisyphus happy\\" as \\"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.\\" More recently, J. Nigro Sansonese,Sansonese, J. Nigro. The Body of Myth. Rochester, 1994, pp. 45‚Äì52. building on the work of Georges Dum√©zil, speculates that the origin of the name \\"Sisyphus\\" is onomatopoetic of the continual back-and-forth, susurrant sound (\\"siss phuss\\") made by the breath in the nasal passages, situating the mythology of Sisyphus in a far larger context of archaic (see Proto-Indo-European religion) trance- inducing techniques related to breath control. The repetitive inhalation‚Äìexhalation cycle is described esoterically in the myth as an up‚Äìdown motion of Sisyphus and his boulder on a hill. In experiments that test how workers respond when the meaning of their task is diminished, the test condition is referred to as the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment are that people work harder when their work seems more meaningful, and that people underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation. In his book The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking,Manfred Kopfer (2018); The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking, The recursive solution for Sisyphos problem. German author Manfred Kopfer suggested a viable solution for Sisyphus punishment. Every time Sisyphus reaches the top of the mountain, he breaks off a stone from the mountain and carries it down to the lowest point. This way, the mountain will eventually be levelled and the stone cannot roll down anymore. In Kopfers interpretation, the solution turns the punishment by the gods into a test for Sisyphus to prove his worthiness for godlike deeds. If Sisyphus is able \\"to move a mountain\\", he shall be allowed to do what otherwise only gods are entitled to do. =Literary interpretations= Sisyphus (1548‚Äì49) by Titian, Prado Museum, Madrid, Spain Homer describes Sisyphus in both Book VI of the Iliad and Book XI of the Odyssey. Ovid, the Roman poet, makes reference to Sisyphus in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. When Orpheus descends and confronts Hades and Persephone, he sings a song so that they will grant his wish to bring Eurydice back from the dead. After this song is sung, Ovid shows how moving it was by noting that Sisyphus, emotionally affected, for just a moment, stops his eternal task and sits on his rock, the Latin wording being inque tuo sedisti, Sisyphe, saxo (\\"and you sat, Sisyphus, on your rock\\").Ovid. Metamorphoses, 10.44. In Plato's Apology, Socrates looks forward to the after-life where he can meet figures such as Sisyphus, who think themselves wise, so that he can question them and find who is wise and who \\"thinks he is when he is not\\"Apology, 41a Albert Camus, the French absurdist, wrote an essay entitled The Myth of Sisyphus, in which he elevates Sisyphus to the status of absurd hero. Franz Kafka repeatedly referred to Sisyphus as a bachelor; Kafkaesque for him were those qualities that brought out the Sisyphus-like qualities in himself. According to Frederick Karl: \\"The man who struggled to reach the heights only to be thrown down to the depths embodied all of Kafka's aspirations; and he remained himself, alone, solitary.\\"Karl, Frederick. Franz Kafka: Representative Man. New York: International Publishing Corporation, 1991. p. 2 The philosopher Richard Taylor uses the myth of Sisyphus as a representation of a life made meaningless because it consists of bare repetition.Taylor, Richard. \\"Time and Life's Meaning.\\" Review of Metaphysics 40 (June 1987): 675‚Äì686.

It included most of the territory of modern-day Central Serbia, Kosovo, parts of Northern Albania and the northern parts of the modern North Macedonia (Moesia Superior), Northern Bulgaria, Romanian Dobrudja and Southern Ukraine (Moesia Inferior). Geography In ancient geographical sources, Moesia was bounded to the south by the Haemus (Balkans) and Scardus (≈†ar) mountains, to the west by the Drinus (Drina) river, on the north by the Donaris (Danube) and on the east by the Euxine (Black Sea). History The region was inhabited chiefly by Thracians, Dacians (Thraco-Dacians), Illyrian and Thraco-Illyrian peoples. The name of the region comes from Moesi, Thraco-Dacian peoples who lived there before the Roman conquest. Parts of Moesia belonged to the polity of Burebista, a Getae king who established his rule over a large part of the northern Balkans between 82 BC and 44 BC. He led plunder and conquest raids across Central and Southeastern Europe, subjugating most of the neighbouring tribes. After his assassination in an inside plot, the empire was divided into several smaller states. In 75 BC, C. Scribonius Curio, proconsul of Macedonia, took an army as far as the Danube and gained a victory over the inhabitants, who were finally subdued by M. Licinius Crassus, grandson of the triumvir and later also proconsul of Macedonia during the reign of Augustus c. 29 BC. The region, however, was not organized as a province until the last years of Augustus' reign; in 6 AD, mention is made of its governor, Caecina Severus.Cassius Dio, lv.29 As a province, Moesia was under an imperial consular legate (who probably also had control of Achaea and Macedonia). In 86 AD the Dacian king Duras ordered his troops to attack Roman Moesia. After this attack, the Roman emperor Domitian personally arrived in Moesia and reorganized it in 87 AD into two provinces, divided by the river Cebrus (Ciabrus): to the west Moesia Superior - Upper Moesia, (meaning up river) and to the east Moesia Inferior - Lower Moesia (also called Ripa Thracia), (from the Danube river's mouth and then upstream). Each was governed by an imperial consular legate and a procurator. The chief towns of Upper Moesia in the Principate were: Singidunum (Belgrade), Viminacium (sometimes called municipium Aelium; modern Kostolac), Remesiana (Bela Palanka), Bononia (Vidin), Ratiaria (Archar) and Skupi (modern Skopje); of Lower Moesia: Oescus (colonia Ulpia, Gigen), Novae (near Svishtov, the chief seat of Theodoric the Great), Nicopolis ad Istrum (Nikup; really near the river Yantra), Marcianopolis (Devnya), Tyras (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi), Olvia, Odessus (Varna) and Tomis (Constan≈£a; to which the poet Ovid was banished). The last two were Greek towns which formed a pentapolis with Istros, Mesembria (Nessebar) and Apollonia (Sozopol). From Moesia, Domitian began planning future campaigns into Dacia and by 87 he started a strong offensive against Dacia, ordering General Cornelius Fuscus to attack. Therefore, in the summer of 87, Fuscus led five or six legions across the Danube. The campaign against the Dacians ended without a decisive outcome, and Decebalus, the Dacian King, had brazenly flouted the terms of the peace (89 AD) which had been agreed on at the war's end. Emperor Trajan later arrived in Moesia, and he launched his first military campaign into the Dacian Kingdom c. March‚ÄìMay 101, crossing to the northern bank of the Danube River and defeating the Dacian army near Tapae, a mountain pass in the Carpathians (see Second Battle of Tapae). Trajan's troops were mauled in the encounter, however, and he put off further campaigning for the year to heal troops, reinforce, and regroup. During the following winter, King Decebalus launched a counter-attack across the Danube further downstream, but this was repulsed. Trajan's army advanced further into Dacian territory and forced King Decebalus to submit to him a year later. Trajan returned to Rome in triumph and was granted the title Dacicus. The victory was celebrated by the Tropaeum Traiani. However, Decebalus in 105 undertook an invasion against Roman territory by attempting to stir up some of the tribes north of the river against the empire. Trajan took to the field again and after building with the design of Apollodorus of Damascus his massive bridge over the Danube, he conquered part of Dacia in 106 (see also Second Dacian War). Sometime around 272, at the Moesian city of Naissus or Nissa (modern Ni≈° in Serbia), future emperor Constantine I was born. After the abandonment of Roman Dacia to the Goths by Aurelian (270‚Äì275) and the transfer of the Roman citizens from the former province to the south of the Danube, the central portion of Moesia took the name of Dacia Aureliana (later divided into Dacia Ripensis and Dacia Mediterranea). During administrative reforms of Emperor Diocletian (284‚Äì305), both of the Moesian provinces were reorganized. Moesia Superior was divided in two, northern part forming the province of Moesia Prima including cities Viminacium and Singidunum, while the southern part was organised as the new province of Dardania with cities Scupi and Ulpiana. At the same time, Moesia Inferior was divided into Moesia Secunda and Scythia Minor. Moesia Secunda's main cities included Marcianopolis (Devnya), Odessus (Varna), Nicopolis (Nikopol), Abrittus (Razgrad), Durostorum (Silistra), Transmarisca (Tutrakan), Sexaginta Prista (Ruse) and Novae (Svishtov), all in Bulgaria today. The Moesian provinces and the northern Balkans in Late Antiquity As a frontier province, Moesia was strengthened by stations and fortresses erected along the southern bank of the Danube, and a wall was built from Axiopolis to Tomi as a protection against the Scythians and Sarmatians. The garrison of Moesia Secunda included Legio I Italica and Legio XI Claudia, as well as independent infantry units, cavalry units, and river flotillas. The Notitia Dignitatum lists its units and their bases as of the 390s CE. Units in Scythia Minor included Legio I Iovia and Legio II Herculia. After 238 AD, Moesia was frequently invaded or raided by the Dacian Carpi, and the East Germanic tribe of the Goths, who invaded Moesia in 250. Hard-pressed by the Huns, the Goths again crossed the Danube during the reign of Valens (376) and with his permission settled in Moesia. After they settled, quarrels soon took place, and the Goths under Fritigern defeated Valens in a great battle near Adrianople. These Goths are known as Moeso-Goths, for whom Ulfilas made the Gothic translation of the Bible. The Slavs allied with the Avars invaded and destroyed much of Moesia in 583‚Äì587 in the Avar‚ÄìByzantine wars. Moesia was settled by Slavs during the 7th century. Bulgars, arriving from Old Great Bulgaria, conquered Lower Moesia by the end of the 7th century. During the 8th century the Byzantine Empire lost also Upper Moesian territory to the First Bulgarian Empire.

It was named after Walther Nernst, a German physical chemist who formulated the equation. Expression A quantitative relationship between cell potential and concentration of the ions : Ox + z e‚àí ‚Üí Red standard thermodynamics says that the actual Gibbs free energy is related to the free energy change under standard state by the relationship: : \\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta G^{\\\\ominus} + RT\\\\ln Q_r where is the reaction quotient. The cell potential associated with the electrochemical reaction is defined as the decrease in Gibbs free energy per coulomb of charge transferred, which leads to the relationship \\\\Delta G = -zFE. The constant (the Faraday constant) is a unit conversion factor , where is the Avogadro constant and is the fundamental electron charge. This immediately leads to the Nernst equation, which for an electrochemical half-cell is :E_\\\\text{red} = E^\\\\ominus_\\\\text{red} - \\\\frac{RT}{zF} \\\\ln Q_r=E^\\\\ominus_\\\\text{red} - \\\\frac{RT}{zF} \\\\ln\\\\frac{a_\\\\text{Red}}{a_\\\\text{Ox}}. For a complete electrochemical reaction (full cell), the equation can be written as :E_\\\\text{cell} = E^\\\\ominus_\\\\text{cell} - \\\\frac{RT}{zF} \\\\ln Q_r where : is the half-cell reduction potential at the temperature of interest, : is the standard half- cell reduction potential, : is the cell potential (electromotive force) at the temperature of interest, : is the standard cell potential, : is the universal gas constant: , : is the temperature in kelvins, : is the number of electrons transferred in the cell reaction or half-reaction, : is the Faraday constant, the number of coulombs per mole of electrons: , : is the reaction quotient of the cell reaction, and : is the chemical activity for the relevant species, where is the activity of the reduced form and is the activity of the oxidized form. Similarly to equilibrium constants, activities are always measured with respect to the standard state (1 mol/L for solutes, 1 atm for gases). The activity of species X, , can be related to the physical concentrations via , where is the activity coefficient of species X. Because activity coefficients tend to unity at low concentrations, activities in the Nernst equation are frequently replaced by simple concentrations. Alternatively, defining the formal potential as: :E^{\\\\ominus '}=E^{\\\\ominus}+\\\\frac{RT}{zF}\\\\ln\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_{Ox}}{\\\\gamma_{Red}} the half-cell Nernst equation may be written in terms of concentrations as: :E_\\\\text{red}=E^{\\\\ominus '}_\\\\text{red} - \\\\frac{RT}{zF} \\\\ln\\\\frac{C_\\\\text{Red}}{C_\\\\text{Ox}} and likewise for the full cell expression. At room temperature (25 ¬∞C), the thermal voltage V_T=\\\\frac{RT}{F} is approximately 25.693 mV. The Nernst equation is frequently expressed in terms of base-10 logarithms (i.e., common logarithms) rather than natural logarithms, in which case it is written: :E = E^0 + \\\\frac{V_T}{z} \\\\ln\\\\frac{a_\\\\text{Ox}}{a_\\\\text{Red}} = E^0 + \\\\frac{\\\\lambda V_T}{z} \\\\log_{10}\\\\frac{a_\\\\text{Ox}}{a_\\\\text{Red}}. where Œª=ln(10) and ŒªVT =0.05916...V. The Nernst equation is used in physiology for finding the electric potential of a cell membrane with respect to one type of ion. It can be linked to the acid dissociation constant. Nernst potential The Nernst equation has a physiological application when used to calculate the potential of an ion of charge across a membrane. This potential is determined using the concentration of the ion both inside and outside the cell: :E = \\\\frac{R T}{z F} \\\\ln\\\\frac{[\\\\text{ion outside cell}]}{[\\\\text{ion inside cell}]} = 2.3026\\\\frac{R T}{z F} \\\\log_{10}\\\\frac{[\\\\text{ion outside cell}]}{[\\\\text{ion inside cell}]}. When the membrane is in thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e., no net flux of ions), the membrane potential must be equal to the Nernst potential. However, in physiology, due to active ion pumps, the inside and outside of a cell are not in equilibrium. In this case, the resting potential can be determined from the Goldman equation, which is a solution of G-H-K influx equation under the constraints that total current density driven by electrochemical force is zero: :E_\\\\mathrm{m} = \\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln{ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_i^N P_{\\\\mathrm{M}^+_i}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{M}^+_i\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{out} + \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_j^M P_{\\\\mathrm{A}^-_j}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{A}^-_j\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{in}}{ \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_i^N P_{\\\\mathrm{M}^+_i}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{M}^+_i\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{in} + \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_j^M P_{\\\\mathrm{A}^-_j}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{A}^-_j\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{out}} \\\\right) }, where : is the membrane potential (in volts, equivalent to joules per coulomb), : is the permeability for that ion (in meters per second), : is the extracellular concentration of that ion (in moles per cubic meter, to match the other SI units, though the units strictly don't matter, as the ion concentration terms become a dimensionless ratio), : is the intracellular concentration of that ion (in moles per cubic meter), : is the ideal gas constant (joules per kelvin per mole), : is the temperature in kelvins, : is Faraday's constant (coulombs per mole).The potential across the cell membrane that exactly opposes net diffusion of a particular ion through the membrane is called the Nernst potential for that ion. As seen above, the magnitude of the Nernst potential is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of that specific ion on the two sides of the membrane. The greater this ratio the greater the tendency for the ion to diffuse in one direction, and therefore the greater the Nernst potential required to prevent the diffusion.A similar expression exists that includes (the absolute value of the transport ratio). This takes transporters with unequal exchanges into account. See: sodium-potassium pump where the transport ratio would be 2/3, so r equals 1.5 in the formula below. The reason why we insert a factor r = 1.5 here is that current density by electrochemical force Je.c.(Na+)+Je.c.(K+) is no longer zero, but rather Je.c.(Na+)+1.5Je.c.(K+)=0 (as for both ions flux by electrochemical force is compensated by that by the pump, i.e. Je.c.=-Jpump), altering the constraints for applying GHK equation. The other variables are the same as above. The following example includes two ions: potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+). Chloride is assumed to be in equilibrium. :E_{m} = \\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln{ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ rP_{\\\\mathrm{K}^+}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{K}^+\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{out} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Na}^+}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{Na}^+\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{out}}{ rP_{\\\\mathrm{K}^+}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{K}^+\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{in} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Na}^+}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{Na}^+\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{in}} \\\\right) }. When chloride (Cl‚àí) is taken into account, :E_{m} = \\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln{ \\\\left( \\\\frac{r P_{\\\\mathrm{K}^+}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{K}^+\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{out} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Na}^+}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{Na}^+\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{out} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Cl}^-}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{Cl}^-\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{in}}{r P_{\\\\mathrm{K}^+}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{K}^+\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{in} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Na}^+}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{Na}^+\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{in} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Cl}^-}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{Cl}^-\\\\right]_\\\\mathrm{out}} \\\\right) }. Derivation =Using Boltzmann factor= For simplicity, we will consider a solution of redox-active molecules that undergo a one-electron reversible reaction : Ox + e‚àí Red and that have a standard potential of zero, and in which the activities are well represented by the concentrations (i.e. unit activity coefficient). The chemical potential of this solution is the difference between the energy barriers for taking electrons from and for giving electrons to the working electrode that is setting the solution's electrochemical potential.The ratio of oxidized to reduced molecules, , is equivalent to the probability of being oxidized (giving electrons) over the probability of being reduced (taking electrons), which we can write in terms of the Boltzmann factor for these processes: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Red}]}{[\\\\mathrm{Ox}]} &= \\\\frac{\\\\exp \\\\left(-[\\\\mbox{barrier for gaining an electron}]/kT\\\\right)}{\\\\exp \\\\left(-[\\\\mbox{barrier for losing an electron}]/kT\\\\right)}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6px] &= \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{c}}{kT} \\\\right). \\\\end{align} Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives : \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{c} = kT \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Red}]}{[\\\\mathrm{Ox}]}. If at = 1, we need to add in this additional constant: : \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{c} = \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{c}^0 + kT \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Red}]}{[\\\\mathrm{Ox}]}. Dividing the equation by to convert from chemical potentials to electrode potentials, and remembering that ,; see gas constant ; see Faraday constant we obtain the Nernst equation for the one-electron process : : \\\\begin{align} E &= E^0 - \\\\frac{kT}{e} \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Red}]}{[\\\\mathrm{Ox}]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= E^0 - \\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Red}]}{[\\\\mathrm{Ox}]}. \\\\end{align} =Using thermodynamics (chemical potential)= Quantities here are given per molecule, not per mole, and so Boltzmann constant and the electron charge are used instead of the gas constant and Faraday's constant . To convert to the molar quantities given in most chemistry textbooks, it is simply necessary to multiply by the Avogadro constant: and . The entropy of a molecule is defined as : S \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ k \\\\ln \\\\Omega, where is the number of states available to the molecule. The number of states must vary linearly with the volume of the system (here an idealized system is considered for better understanding, so that activities are posited very close to the true concentrations. Fundamental statistical proof of the mentioned linearity goes beyond the scope of this section, but to see this is true it is simpler to consider usual isothermal process for an ideal gas where the change of entropy takes place. It follows from the definition of entropy and from the condition of constant temperature and quantity of gas that the change in the number of states must be proportional to the relative change in volume . In this sense there is no difference in statistical properties of ideal gas atoms compared with the dissolved species of a solution with activity coefficients equaling one: particles freely \\"hang around\\" filling the provided volume), which is inversely proportional to the concentration , so we can also write the entropy as : S = k\\\\ln \\\\ (\\\\mathrm{constant}\\\\times V) = -k\\\\ln \\\\ (\\\\mathrm{constant}\\\\times c). The change in entropy from some state 1 to another state 2 is therefore : \\\\Delta S = S_2 - S_1 = - k \\\\ln \\\\frac{c_2}{c_1}, so that the entropy of state 2 is : S_2 = S_1 - k \\\\ln \\\\frac{c_2}{c_1}. If state 1 is at standard conditions, in which is unity (e.g., 1 atm or 1 M), it will merely cancel the units of . We can, therefore, write the entropy of an arbitrary molecule A as : S(\\\\mathrm{A}) = S^0(\\\\mathrm{A}) - k \\\\ln [\\\\mathrm{A}], where is the entropy at standard conditions and [A] denotes the concentration of A.The change in entropy for a reaction : A + B ‚Üí Y + Zis then given by : \\\\Delta S_\\\\mathrm{rxn} = \\\\big(yS(\\\\mathrm{Y}) + zS(\\\\mathrm{Z})\\\\big) - \\\\big(aS(\\\\mathrm{A}) + bS(\\\\mathrm{B})\\\\big) = \\\\Delta S^0_\\\\mathrm{rxn} - k \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Y}]^y [\\\\mathrm{Z}]^z}{[\\\\mathrm{A}]^a [\\\\mathrm{B}]^b}. We define the ratio in the last term as the reaction quotient: : Q_r = \\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_j a_j^{ u_j}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_i a_i^{ u_i}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Z}]^z [\\\\mathrm{Y}]^y}{[\\\\mathrm{A}]^a [\\\\mathrm{B}]^b}, where the numerator is a product of reaction product activities, , each raised to the power of a stoichiometric coefficient, , and the denominator is a similar product of reactant activities. All activities refer to a time . Under certain circumstances (see chemical equilibrium) each activity term such as may be replaced by a concentration term, [A].In an electrochemical cell, the cell potential is the chemical potential available from redox reactions (). is related to the Gibbs energy change only by a constant: , where is the number of electrons transferred and is the Faraday constant. There is a negative sign because a spontaneous reaction has a negative free energy and a positive potential . The Gibbs energy is related to the entropy by , where is the enthalpy and is the temperature of the system. Using these relations, we can now write the change in Gibbs energy, : \\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta H - T \\\\Delta S = \\\\Delta G^0 + kT \\\\ln Q_r, and the cell potential, : E = E^0 - \\\\frac{kT}{ze} \\\\ln Q_r. This is the more general form of the Nernst equation. For the redox reaction , :Q_r = \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Red}]}{[\\\\mathrm{Ox}]}, and we have: : \\\\begin{align} E &= E^0 - \\\\frac{kT}{ne} \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Red}]}{[\\\\mathrm{Ox}]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= E^0 - \\\\frac{RT}{zF} \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Red}]}{[\\\\mathrm{Ox}]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= E^0 - \\\\frac{RT}{zF} \\\\ln Q_r. \\\\end{align} The cell potential at standard conditions is often replaced by the formal potential , which includes some small corrections to the logarithm and is the potential that is actually measured in an electrochemical cell. Relation to equilibrium At equilibrium, the electrochemical potential and therefore the reaction quotient attains the special value known as the equilibrium constant: . Therefore, : \\\\begin{align} 0 &= E^0 - \\\\frac{RT}{zF} \\\\ln K \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln K &= \\\\frac{zFE^0}{RT}. \\\\end{align} Or at standard temperature, :\\\\log_{10} K = \\\\frac{zE^0}{\\\\lambda V_T} = \\\\frac{zE^0}{0.05916\\\\text{ V}} \\\\quad\\\\text{at }T = 298.15~\\\\text{K}. We have thus related the standard electrode potential and the equilibrium constant of a redox reaction. Limitations In dilute solutions, the Nernst equation can be expressed directly in the terms of concentrations (since activity coefficients are close to unity). But at higher concentrations, the true activities of the ions must be used. This complicates the use of the Nernst equation, since estimation of non-ideal activities of ions generally requires experimental measurements.The Nernst equation also only applies when there is no net current flow through the electrode. The activity of ions at the electrode surface changes when there is current flow, and there are additional overpotential and resistive loss terms which contribute to the measured potential.At very low concentrations of the potential-determining ions, the potential predicted by Nernst equation approaches toward . This is physically meaningless because, under such conditions, the exchange current density becomes very low, and there is no thermodynamic equilibrium necessary for Nernst equation to hold. The electrode is called unpoised in such case. Other effects tend to take control of the electrochemical behavior of the system. =Time dependence of the potential= The expression of time dependence has been established by Karaoglanoff.The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Volume 10, p 316. https://books.google.com/books?id=zCMSAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA316&lpg;=PA316&hl;=en&f;=false Significance to related scientific domains The equation has been involved in the scientific controversy involving cold fusion. The discoverers of cold fusion, Fleischmann and Pons, calculated that a palladium cathode immersed in a heavy water electrolysis cell could achieve up to 1027 atmospheres of pressure on the surface of the cathode, enough pressure to cause spontaneous nuclear fusion. In reality, only 10,000‚Äì20,000 atmospheres were achieved. John R. Huizenga claimed their original calculation was affected by a misinterpretation of Nernst equation. He cited a paper about Pd‚ÄìZr alloys. The equation permits the extent of reaction between two redox systems to be calculated and can be used, for example, to decide whether a particular reaction will go to completion or not. At equilibrium the emfs of the two half cells are equal. This enables to be calculated hence the extent of the reaction.

His formulation of the Nernst heat theorem helped pave the way for the third law of thermodynamics, for which he won the 1920 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He is also known for developing the Nernst equation in 1887. Life and career =Early years= Nernst was born in Briesen in West Prussia (now WƒÖbrze≈∫no, Poland) to Gustav Nernst (1827‚Äì1888) and Ottilie Nerger (1833‚Äì1876).Bartel, Hans-Georg, (1999) \\"Nernst, Walther\\", pp. 66‚Äì68 in Neue Deutsche Biographie, Vol. 19 His father was a country judge. Nernst had three older sisters and one younger brother. His third sister died of cholera. Nernst went to elementary school at Graudenz. He studied physics and mathematics at the universities of Z√ºrich, Berlin, Graz and W√ºrzburg, where he received his doctorate 1887. In 1889, he finished his habilitation at University of Leipzig. =Personal attributes= It was said that Nernst was mechanically minded in that he was always thinking of ways to apply new discoveries to industry. His hobbies included hunting and fishing. His friend Albert Einstein was amused by \\"his childlike vanity and self- complacency\\"http://www.nernst.de/nernst_einstein1942.htm \\"His own study and laboratory always presented aspects of extreme chaos which his coworkers termed appropriately 'the state of maximum entropy'\\".Mendelssohn 1973, p. 70. =Family history= Nernst married Emma Lohmeyer in 1892 with whom he had two sons and three daughters. Both of Nernst's sons died fighting in World War I. With his colleagues at the University of Leipzig, Jacobus Henricus van‚Äôt Hoff and Svante Arrhenius, was establishing the foundations of a new theoretical and experimental field of inquiry within chemistry and suggested setting fire to unused coal seams to increase the global temperature. He was a vocal critic of Adolf Hitler and Nazism, and two of his three daughters married Jewish men. After Hitler came to power they emigrated, one to England and the other to Brazil. =Career= Walther Nernst in 1889. Nernst started university at Zurich in 1883, then after an interlude in Berlin, he returned to Zurich.http://www.nernst.de/ He wrote his thesis at Graz where Boltzmann was professor, though he worked under the direction of Ettinghausen. They discovered the Nernst effect: that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to a metallic conductor in a temperature gradient gives rise to an electrical potential difference. Next, he moved to W√ºrzburg under Kohlrausch where he submitted and defended his thesis. Ostwald recruited him to the first department of physical chemistry at Leipzig. Nernst moved there as an assistant, working on the thermodynamics of electrical currents in solutions. Promoted to lecturer, he taught briefly at Heidelberg and then moved to G√∂ttingen. Three years later, he was offered a professorship in Munich, to keep him in Prussia the government created a chair for him at G√∂ttingen. There, he wrote a celebrated textbook Theoretical Chemistry, which was translated into English, French, and Russian. He also derived the Nernst equation for the electrical potential generated by unequal concentrations of an ion separated by a membrane that is permeable to the ion. His equation is widely used in cell physiology and neurobiology. The carbon electric filament lamp then in use was dim and expensive because it required a vacuum in its bulb. Nernst invented a solid-body radiator with a filament of rare-earth oxides, known as the Nernst glower, it is still important in the field of infrared spectroscopy. Continuous ohmic heating of the filament results in conduction. The glower operates best in wavelengths from 2 to 14 micrometers. It gives a bright light but only after a warm-up period. Nernst sold the patent for one million marks, wisely not opting for royalties because soon the tungsten filament lamp filled with inert gas was introduced. With his riches, Nernst in 1898 bought the first of the eighteen automobiles he owned during his lifetime and a country estate of more than a five hundred hectares for hunting. He increased the power of his early automobiles by carrying a cylinder of nitrous oxide that he could inject into the carburetor. After eighteen productive years at G√∂ttingen, investigating osmotic pressure and electrochemistry and presenting a theory of how nerves conduct, he moved to Berlin, and was awarded the title Geheimrat Nernst 1912, portrait by Max Liebermann In 1905, he proposed his \\"New Heat Theorem\\", later known as the Third law of thermodynamics. He showed that as the temperature approached absolute zero, the entropy approaches zero while the free energy remains above zero. This is the work for which he is best remembered, as it enabled chemists to determine free energies (and therefore equilibrium points) of chemical reactions from heat measurements. Theodore Richards claimed that Nernst had stolen his idea, but Nernst is almost universally credited with the discovery. Nernst became friendly with Kaiser Wilhelm, whom he persuaded to found the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for the Advancement of the Sciences with an initial capital of eleven million marks. Nernst's laboratory discovered that at low temperatures specific heats fell markedly and would probably disappear at absolute zero. This fall was predicted for liquids and solids in a 1909 paper of Albert Einstein's on the quantum mechanics of specific heats at cryogenic temperatures. Nernst was so impressed that he traveled all the way to Zurich to visit Einstein, who was relatively unknown in Zurich in 1909, so people said: \\"Einstein must be a clever fellow if the great Nernst comes all the way from Berlin to Zurich to talk to him.\\" Nernst and Planck lobbied to establish a special professorship in Berlin and Nernst donated to its endowment. In 1913 they traveled to Switzerland to persuade Einstein to accept it; a dream job: a named professorship at the top university in Germany, without teaching duties, leaving him free for research.Stone 2013, p. 165. In 1911, Nernst and Max Planck organized the first Solvay Conference in Brussels. In the following year, the impressionist painter Max Liebermann painted his portrait. In 1914, the Nernsts were entertaining coworkers and students they had brought to their country estate in a private railway car when they learned that war had been declared. Their two older sons entered the army, while father enlisted in the voluntary driver's corps. He supported the German army against their opponent's charges of barbarism by signing the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, On 21 August 1914, he drove documents from Berlin to the commander of the German right wing in France, advancing with them for two weeks until he could see the glow of the Paris lights at night. The tide turned at the battle of the Marne. When the stalemate in the trenches began, he returned home. He contacted Colonel Max Bauer, the staff officer responsible for munitions, with the idea of driving the defenders out of their trenches with shells releasing tear gas. When his idea was tried one of the observers was Fritz Haber, who argued that too many shells would be needed, it would be better to release a cloud of heavier-than-air poisonous gas; the first chlorine cloud attack on 22 April 1915 was not supported by a strong infantry thrust, so the chance that gas would break the stalemate was irrevocably gone. Nernst was awarded the Iron Cross second class. As a Staff Scientific Advisor in the Imperial German Army, he directed research on explosives, much of which was done in his laboratory where they developed guanidine perchlorate. Then he worked on the development of trench mortars. He was awarded the Iron Cross first class and later the Pour le M√©rite. When the high command was considering unleashing unrestricted submarine warfare, he asked the Kaiser for an opportunity to warn about the enormous potential of the United States as an adversary. They would not listen, Ludendorff shouted him down for \\"incompetent nonsense.\\"Mendelssohn 1973, p. 92 He published his book The Foundations of the New Heat Theorem. Both sons had died at the front. In 1918, after studying photochemistry, he proposed the atomic chain reaction theory. It stated that when a reaction in which free atoms are formed that can decompose target molecules into more free atoms would result in a chain reaction. His theory is closely related to the natural process of Nuclear Fission. In 1920, he and his family briefly fled abroad because he was one of the scientists on the Allied list of war criminals. Later that year he received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in recognition of his work on thermochemistry. He was elected Rector of Berlin University for 1921-1922. He set up an agency to channel government and private funds to young scientists and declined becoming Ambassador to the United States. For two unhappy years, he was the president of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (National Physical Laboratory), where he could not cope with the \\"mixture of mediocrity and red tape\\".Mendelssohn 1973, p. 138. In 1924, he became director of the Institute of Physical Chemistry at Berlin. In 1927, the decrease in specific heat at low temperatures was extended to gases. He studied the theories of cosmic rays and cosmology. Although a press release described him as \\"completely unmusical\\",Mendelssohn 1973, p. 139. Nernst developed an electric piano, the \\"Neo-Bechstein-Fl√ºgel\\" in 1930 in association with the Bechstein and Siemens companies, replacing the sounding board with vacuum tube amplifiers. The piano used electromagnetic pickups to produce electronically modified and amplified sound in the same way as an electric guitar. In fact, he was a pianist, sometimes accompanying Einstein's violin. In 1933, Nernst learned that a colleague, with whom he had hoped to collaborate, had been dismissed from the department because he was a Jew. Nernst immediately taxied to see Haber to request a position in his Institute, which was not controlled by the government, only to learn that Haber was moving to England. Soon, Nernst was in trouble for declining to fill out a government form on his racial origins. He retired from his professorship but was sacked from the board of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. He lived quietly in the country; in 1937 he traveled to Oxford to receive an honorary degree, also visiting his eldest daughter, her husband, and his three grandchildren. Nernst had a severe heart attack in 1939. He died in 1941 and is buried near Max Planck, Otto Hahn and Max von Laue in G√∂ttingen, Germany.

The Chicago Manual of Style (abbreviated in writing as CMOS or CMS, or sometimes as Chicago) is a style guide for American English published since 1906 by the University of Chicago Press. Its 17 editions have prescribed writing and citation styles widely used in publishing. It is \\"one of the most widely used and respected style guides in the United States\\". The guide specifically focuses on American English and deals with aspects of editorial practice, including grammar and usage, as well as document preparation and formatting. It is available in print as a hardcover book, and by subscription as a searchable website as The Chicago Manual of Style Online. The online version provides some free resources, primarily aimed at teachers, students, and libraries. Availability and uses The Chicago Manual of Style is published in hardcover and online. The online edition includes the searchable text of both the 16th and 17th‚Äîits most recent‚Äîeditions with features such as tools for editors, a citation guide summary, and searchable access to a Q&A;, where University of Chicago Press editors answer readers' style questions. The Chicago Manual of Style also discusses the parts of a book and the editing process. An annual subscription is required for access to the online content of the Manual. (Access to the Q&A;, however, is free, as are various editing tools.) Many publishers throughout the world adopt \\"Chicago\\" as their style. It is used in some social science publications, most North American historical journals, and remains the basis for the Style Guide of the American Anthropological Association, the Style Sheet for the Organization of American Historians, and corporate style guides, including the Apple Style Guide. The Chicago Manual of Style includes chapters relevant to publishers of books and journals. It is used widely by academic and some trade publishers, as well as editors and authors who are required by those publishers to follow it. Kate L. Turabian's A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations also reflects Chicago style. Chicago style offers writers a choice of several different formats. It allows the mixing of formats, provided that the result is clear and consistent. For instance, the 15th edition of The Chicago Manual of Style permits the use of both in-text citation systems and/or footnotes or endnotes, including use of \\"content notes\\"; it gives information about in-text citation by page number (such as MLA style) or by year of publication (like APA style); it even provides for variations in styles of footnotes and endnotes, depending on whether the paper includes a full bibliography at the end.

From its first 203-page edition, the CMOS evolved into a comprehensive reference style guide of 1,146 pages in its 17th edition. It was one of the first editorial style guides published in the United States, and it is largely responsible for research methodology standardization, notably citation style. The most significant revision to the manual was made for the 12th edition, published in 1969. Its first printing of 20,000 copies sold out before it was printed. In 1982, with the publication of the 13th edition, it was officially retitled The Chicago Manual of Style, adopting the informal name already in widespread use. More recently, the publishers have released a new edition about every seven to ten years. The 15th edition (2003) was revised to reflect the emergence of computer technology and the internet in publishing, offering guidance for citing electronic works. Other changes include a chapter on American English grammar and use, and a revised treatment of mathematical copy. In August 2010, the 16th edition was published simultaneously in the hardcover and online editions for the first time in the Manuals history. In a departure from the earlier red-orange cover, the 16th edition features a robin's-egg blue dust jacket (a nod to older editions with blue jackets, such as the 11th and 12th). The 16th edition featured \\"music, foreign languages, and computer topics (such as Unicode characters and URLs)\\". It also expands recommendations for producing electronic publications, including web-based content and e-books. An updated appendix on production and digital technology demystified the process of electronic workflow and offered a primer on the use of XML markup. It also includes a revised glossary, including a host of terms associated with electronic and print publishing. The Chicago system of documentation is streamlined to achieve greater consistency between the author-date and notes- bibliography systems of citation, making both systems easier to use. In addition, updated and expanded examples address the many questions that arise when documenting online and digital sources, from the use of DOIs to citing social networking sites. Figures and tables are updated throughout the book, including a return to the Manuals popular hyphenation table and new, selective listings of Unicode numbers for special characters. In 2013, an adapted Spanish version was published by the University of Deusto in Bilbao, Spain. In April 2016, the publisher released The Chicago Guide to Grammar, Usage, and Punctuation, Bryan A. Garner's expansion of his Chicago Manual of Style chapter on the topic, and coinciding with the release of the new edition of Garner's Modern American Usage. The 17th edition was published in September 2017. It offers new and expanded style guidelines in response to advancing technology and social change. It also includes new and revised content reflecting the latest publishing practices and electronic workflows and self- publishing. Citation recommendations, the glossary of problematic words and phrases, and the bibliography have all been updated and expanded. In the 17th edition, email lost its hyphen, internet became lowercase, the singular \\"they\\" and \\"their\\" are now acceptable in certain circumstances, a major new section on syntax has been added, and the long-standing recommendation to use \\"ibid\\" has changed due to electronic publishing. =History of editions= * First Edition, 1906 * Second Edition, 1910 * Third Edition, 1911 * Fourth Edition, 1914 * Fifth Edition, 1917 * Sixth Edition, 1919 * Seventh Edition, 1920 * Eighth Edition, 1925 * Ninth Edition, 1927 * 10th Edition, 1937 * 11th Edition, 1949 * 12th Edition, 1969 * 13th Edition, 1982 * 14th Edition, 1993 * 15th Edition, 2003 * 16th Edition, 2010 * 17th Edition, 2017  Critique  According to the Chicago Manual of Style, authors in the References section should be listed in alphabetical order. However, studies have demonstrated that alphabetical lists can lead to a significant discrimination of authors with last names in the end of such lists (e.g., funding, citations).Einav, L., & Yariv, L. (2006). What's in a surname? The effects of surname initials on academic success. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 20(1), 175-187.

John Wiley & Sons, 2005. is a computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. CMSs are typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM). ECM typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environmentMoving Media Storage Technologies: Applications & Workflows for Video and Media S2011. Page 381 by integrating document management, digital asset management and record retention. Alternatively, WCM is the collaborative authoring for websites and may include text and embed graphics, photos, video, audio, maps and program code that display content and interact with the user. ECM typically includes a WCM function.  Structure  A (CMS) typically has two major components: a content management application (CMA), as the front-end user interface that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, and remove content from a website without the intervention of a webmaster; and a content delivery application (CDA), that compiles the content and updates the website.  Common features  The core CMS features are, indexing, search and retrieval, format management, revision control, and management. Features may vary depending on the system application but will typically include: * Intuitive indexing, search and retrieval features index all data for easy access through search functions and allow users to search by attributes such as publication dates, keywords or author. * Format management facilitates turning scanned paper documents and legacy electronic documents into HTML or PDF documents. * Revision features allow content to be updated and edited after initial publication. Revision control also tracks any changes made to files by individuals. * Publishing functionality allows individuals to use a template or a set of templates approved by the organization, as well as wizards and other tools to create or modify content. Popular additional features may include: * SEO-friendly URLs * Integrated and online help, including discussion boards * Group-based permission systems * Full template support and customisable templates * Easy wizard-based install and versioning procedures * Admin panel with multiple language support * Content hierarchy with unlimited depth and size * Minimal server requirements * Integrated file managers * Integrated audit logs  Other types of content management systems  Digital asset management systems are another type of CMS. They manage content with clearly defined author or ownership, such as documents, movies, pictures, phone numbers, and scientific data. Companies also use CMSs to store, control, revise, and publish documentation. There are also component content management systems (CCMS), which are CMSs that manage content at a modular level rather than as pages or articles. CCMSs are often used in technical communication where many publications reuse the same content.  Best known CMSs  Based on market share statistics, the most popular content management system is WordPress, used by more than 37.7% of all websites on the internet (although per definition it is a blog system/website generator, not a full fledged content management system), followed by Shopify used by 2.5% of the websites and Joomla used by 2.4% of the websites.

It contrasts with email service accessible through a specialised email client software. Examples of webmail providers are AOL Mail, Gmail, Mailfence, Outlook.com/Hotmail.com, Yahoo! Mail and IceWarp Mail Server. Additionally, many internet service providers provide webmail as part of their internet service package. Similarly, some web hosting providers also provide webmail as a part of their hosting package. Webmail access is made possible through webmail software, such as Roundcube or SquirrelMail, installed and running on the email server. As with any web application, webmail's main advantage over the use of a desktop email client is the ability to send and receive email anywhere from a web browser. Its main disadvantage is the need to be connected to the Internet while using it.  History  = Early implementations = The first Web Mail implementation was developed at CERN in 1993 by Phillip Hallam-Baker as a test of the HTTP protocol stack, but was not developed further. In the next two years, however, several people produced working webmail applications.

Bill Fitler's webmail implementation was further developed as a commercial product, which Lotus announced and released in the fall of 1995 as cc:Mail for the World Wide Web 1.0; thereby providing an alternative means of accessing a cc:Mail message store (the usual means being a cc:Mail desktop application that operated either via dialup or within the confines of a local area network).Network World, \\"Lotus readies cc:Mail-Web hooks\\", (part 2), September 4, 1995, pp. 1, 55.PR Newswire, \\"Lotus announces cc:Mail for the World Wide Web\\", September 26, 1995.InfoWorld, \\"cc:Mail users will get E-mail through Web\\", October 2, 1995, p. 12.Network World, \\"More from Lotus: X.500 and the Web\\", October 2, 1995, p. 10. Early commercialization of webmail was also achieved when \\"Webex\\"No relation to the current Citrix-owned web conferencing company of the same name began to be sold by Mankins' company, DotShop, Inc., at the end of 1995. Within DotShop, \\"Webex\\" changed its name to \\"EMUmail\\"; which would be sold to companies like UPS and Rackspace until its sale to Accurev in 2001. EMUmail was one of the first applications to feature a free version that included embedded advertising, as well as a licensed version that did not. Hotmail and Four11's RocketMail both launched in 1996 as free services and immediately became very popular. = Widespread deployment = As the 1990s progressed, and into the 2000s, it became more common for the general public to have access to webmail because: * many Internet service providers (such as EarthLink) and web hosting providers (such as Verio) began bundling webmail into their service offerings (often in parallel with POP/SMTP services); * many other enterprises (such as universities and large corporations) also started offering webmail as a way for their user communities to access their email (either locally managed or outsourced); * webmail service providers (such as Hotmail and RocketMail) emerged in 1996 as a free service to the general public, and rapidly gained in popularity. In some cases, webmail application software is developed in-house by the organizations running and managing the application, and in some cases it is obtained from software companies that develop and sell such applications, usually as part of an integrated mail server package (an early example being Netscape Messaging ServerOracle, Cnet Archive - Release Notes: Netscape Messaging Server 4.15). The market for webmail application software has continued into the 2010s.  Rendering and compatibility  Email users may find the use of both a webmail client and a desktop client using the POP3 protocol presents some difficulties. For example, email messages that are downloaded by the desktop client and are removed from the server will no longer be available on the webmail client. The user is limited to previewing messages using the web client before they are downloaded by the desktop email client. However, one may choose to leave the emails on the server, in which case this problem does not occur. The use of both a webmail client and a desktop client using the IMAP4 protocol allows the contents of the mailbox to be consistently displayed in both the webmail and desktop clients and any action the user performs on messages in one interface will be reflected when email is accessed via the other interface. There are significant differences in rendering capabilities for many popular webmail services such as Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo! Mail.

Played by the British actor Peter Butterworth, the character appeared in two stories, The Time Meddler and The Daleks' Master Plan, as an adversary of the First Doctor. They were written and co-written respectively by Dennis Spooner. Other than the Doctor and Susan, the Monk was the first member of the Doctor's species to appear in the programme. Appearances =Television= The character first appeared as an unnamed character who had disguised himself as a monk, and who was the possessor of a stolen Mark IV TARDIS which had a fully functioning camouflage unit. The Doctor hypothesised that he left the Doctor's then-unnamed home planet, some 50 years after the Doctor did. At this early stage in the history of the series, the names Time Lord and Gallifrey, and the details of the Doctor's origins had not yet been devised. The monk was meddling in history to change it for what he considered to be the better: lending mechanical assistance to the builders of Stonehenge; giving Leonardo da Vinci tips on aircraft design; making money by using time travel to exploit compound interest; and, when the Doctor first encountered him, attempting to prevent the Norman Conquest as part of a plan to guide England into an early age of technological prosperity. On that occasion he wore the guise of a monk in order to gain the trust of the 11th-century locals of Northumbria, hence the name by which he became known within this serial. The Doctor stranded the monk in the 11th century by stealing his TARDIS's dimensional controller, which reduced the interior dimensions of the time machine to minuscule size. The character eventually restored his ship and tracked the Doctor to a volcanic planet called Tigus, where he attempted to maroon his enemy by destroying the Doctor's TARDIS's lock with his laser screwdriver. The Doctor managed to repair it and next materialised in Egypt, with the monk still following him. While there, they encountered the Daleks, and the Doctor stole the directional unit from the monk's TARDIS, causing the monk to lose control over his TARDIS's navigation. The monk was last seen leaving an icy planet. =Other media= In the Target Books novelisation of The Time Meddler, it is stated that when the Monk and the Doctor first see each other, there was \\"an instant flash of recognition\\". In the \\"Information\\" section of the board game Doctor Who: The Game of Time & Space, it is stated that the Monk, the War Chief and the Master are simply three different incarnations of the same Time Lord. In the Doctor Who Monthly comic strip 4-Dimensional Vistas (DWM #78-#83, Winter 1983), the Time Meddler teamed up with the Ice Warriors in a complex plan to build a giant sonic weapon. In this portrayal, the character (who piloted a TARDIS also shaped like a police box) did not wear a monk's habit and was referred to as the \\"Time-Meddler\\". The Time-Meddler was defeated by the Fifth Doctor. The Meddling Monk also appeared in Follow That TARDIS! (DWM #147), in which the Sleeze Brothers hijack the Doctor's TARDIS in order to pursue the Monk across time and space after he damages their car. In the The Doctor Who Role Playing Game published by FASA in 1985, the \\"Meddling Monk\\" is stated to be a disguise of an earlier incarnation of the Master, who is depicted as being his sixth incarnation which he personally chose after a failed rebellion on Gallifrey forced him to flee. After the events of The Time Meddler, the Master was able to replace the missing dimensional components, but a minor miscalculation sent him, and his TARDIS to a planet in the \\"crack\\" between realities, a planet which he later named \\"Merast\\" and used as a base of operations. It also cost him a full regeneration, however he was able to keep his current appearance. After the Master's next encounter with the First Doctor on the planet Tigus, he regenerated into a \\"strikingly handsome, middle-aged man\\". The Monk appears in the New Adventures novel No Future by Paul Cornell, in which he is given the name \\"Mortimus\\". The novel was the last of a story arc published to coincide with the series' 30th anniversary in 1993, in which the Seventh Doctor encounters various alternate realities that have been created due to the Monk's meddling with time, including a reality where the Third Doctor was killed in his confrontation with the Silurians (Blood Heat), attempting to distract the Doctor while he helps the Vardans to invade Earth, thus getting their mutual revenge on the Doctor for their losses during their past confrontations with him. Although the Monk seemingly traps the Doctor on the same ice planet he was himself exiled to, thanks to the betrayal of the Doctor's companion Ace, it is revealed at the conclusion of the novel that Ace was simply pretending to side with the Monk to defeat him, the novel ending with the Monk being apparently captured by a Chronovore that he had imprisoned to help him alter time. Mortimus makes an appearance in the Past Doctor Adventures novel Divided Loyalties as part of a dream sequence set during the First Doctor's days at the Academy. Mortimus is seen as part of a group of students, taught by Borusa among others, known as the Deca, a group of activists campaigning for more intervention, alongside the Doctor, Ushas, Koschei, Magnus, Drax, a spy named Vansell, Millennia, Rallon and Jelpax. He aids the Deca in learning about the Celestial Toymaker, several members of which then undertake a disastrous trip to his realm.Parkin, Lance & Pearson, Lars (2012). A History: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe (3rd Edition), p. 710. Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. . The Monk later makes a cameo appearance, as Mortimus, in The Quantum Archangel, working alongside the Rani, Drax and The Master in an artificially created parallel universe. The character, here called \\"John Scanlon\\", appears in the short story The Church of Football in the Big Finish short story collection Short Trips: The Centenarian. He is attempting to alter the course of history in 1930s England. His scheme is stopped by the Fifth Doctor and Peri Brown. The Eighth Doctor discovers another incarnation of the Monk in the Big Finish Productions audio drama The Book of Kells. Voiced by Graeme Garden, the Monk is once again pretending to be a human monk, this time at the Abbey of Kells in Ireland in 1006. Calling himself Thelonios, he used the illuminated art skills of the other monks to create a circuit to repair his TARDIS. He also had his own companion, who happened to be the Doctor's former companion Lucie Miller. It turns out that several of the Doctor's recent adventures had been manipulated behind the scenes by the Monk. He and Lucie reappear in The Resurrection of Mars, this time waking up cryogenically-frozen Ice Warriors on the Martian moon of Deimos, centuries before history says they should so in the future they won't wipe out a world. When Lucie realises what kind of person the Monk is after he causes an avalanche and destroys a small village to kill the parents of a future dictator, she leaves him. He in turn coaxes another of the Doctor's companions, Tamsin Drew, to join him, convincing her that the Doctor is in the wrong by showing Tamsin the planet that will be destroyed by the Ice Warriors if history is left unchecked and then presenting those killed by the Ice Warriors as the Doctor's 'fault' (without revealing that he woke the Ice Warriors up in the first place). After that, he sets off to reunite with the Daleks, planning to loot Earth of its art treasures and get his final revenge on the Doctor, in Lucie Miller / To the Death. He repairs the Dalek Time Controller who had been hurled back through time after a battle with the Sixth Doctor and on Dalek orders leaves a virus on Earth to weaken humanity. However his plans backfire when the Daleks betray him, resulting in the deaths of Tamsin, Lucy, and the Doctor's great-grandson Alex, although the Monk saves the Doctor and Susan in an attempt to make up for his role in the Dalek attack. In an out-of-sequence encounter with the Fifth Doctor, during the events of the audio drama The Secret History, the Monk, distraught over the death of Tamsin Drew, hijacks the Doctor's timeline in an attempt to prevent her death from coming to pass. Using a time-sensitive called Sophia, the Monk attempts to disrupt the Doctor's timeline by causing the Seventh and Sixth Doctors to switch places with the Third and Second Doctors respectively during particular adventures, hoping that the new Doctors will make mistakes and disrupt history as they have different ways of dealing with problems to their predecessors and the circumstances of the switch erase the future Doctors' memories of what their past selves did 'originally'. However, Jo Grant and Zoe Heriot are able to help the new Doctors work out what their predecessors would have done and act to preserve history. Eventually the Monk's plan succeeds when he switches the Fifth Doctor with the First, forcing the Fifth to let history be changed by escalating an outbreak of disease in Constantinople in the fifth century to the point where the he must allow an advanced alien race to take action, prompting the Time Lords to take the Doctor out of time and allowing the Monk to insert himself into the Doctor's timeline. Sophia's abilities to see the future prompt her to restore the Fifth Doctor as she sees that the Monk's actions are making history worse in the absence of the Doctor. This allows the Fifth Doctor to arrange for the Monk to be faced with capture by a group of Antoene warriors so that he will be forced to restore the Doctor's timeline to escape this threat. The Monk escapes and vows to return to continue his vendetta against the Doctor. The Early Adventures story The Black Hole introduces another incarnation of the Monk from the era of the Second Doctor. Rufus Hound voices the new incarnation who has disguised himself as constable Pavo, a member of a special Gallifreyan police unit called Chapter 9. The Monk's plan involves helping an alien race called the Seeth escape from their pocket universe 200 years early, whilst receiving payment to offset the expensive overheads associated with fixing time. The Monk is last seen being sucked into the pocket universe, along with the Seeth, while the Doctor's memory of these events is erased by the real Pavo, who chooses this over taking the Doctor back to Gallifrey as per official policy and admitting that she needed the help of a renegade to stop the Monk's plan. The same incarnation is heard again in the Big Finish Short Trips adventures The Blame Game and How to Win Planets and Influence People, as an adversary of the Third Doctor and Fourth Doctor respectively. He also appears alongside the Eighth Doctor in The Side of the Angels, the third adventure in the fourth Doom Coalition boxset, where he represents a group of Time Lords working with Weeping Angels to prepare an enclave in 1970s New York to protect them from the imminent destruction of the universe, only to be betrayed by the Angels and banished centuries into the past. The Hound incarnation makes a further appearance in The Rise of the New Humans, where he acts as the chief administrator of an exclusive clinic using future technology and resources to treat diseases. The clinic's primary goal is to devise a means of altering human physiology so that the subjects can rapidly adapt and \\"evolve\\" to cope with any threat to their lives, the Monk attempting to force the Doctor to help by infecting Jo with a disease that can only be cured if his process is perfected. However, those subjected to the process develop a hive mind and a desire to \\"infect\\" the rest of humanity, forcing the Monk to help the Doctor devise a cure before he escapes. The Rufus Hound incarnation of the Monk makes an appearance in the series Missy, starring the Michelle Gomez as the Missy incarnation of the Master. In \\"Divorced, Beheaded, Regenerated\\", the Monk is stranded on Earth and, disguised as Henry VIII, meddles with history in order to attract the attention of the Time Lords. He attracts the attention of Missy instead who is herself searching for a time traveller in order to steal their equipment. Missy escapes with a piece of the Monk's TARDIS, with the Monk vowing revenge. The Monk makes a second appearance in \\"Too Many Masters\\" where he enacts his revenge by abducting Missy. Meanwhile the Ogrons are searching for the Master as he had stiffed them on their payment when they were working for him. They detect the Monk's TARDIS and track it. They capture the Monk and Missy. Missy cannot escape in the Monk's TARDIS because he had used a command lock to secure all the controls by isolating them to his unique brain print. Missy then uses the command lock to do the same. They both escape in his TARDIS as neither can operate it without the other. Naming convention Neither the character's real name nor the name he preferred to be referred to as were ever mentioned in the original two television serials he appeared in. As he was disguised as a monk at the time, all other characters referred to him as simply \\"the monk\\", the same name Peter Butterworth was listed as in the episode credits. In the television series Doctor Who, the character's true identity has never been revealed. Multiple spin-off media state that the character was the first appearance of renegade Time Lord the Master, the monk cowl being just a one-off disguise. After the Master's next encounter with the First Doctor on the planet Tigus, he regenerated into a \\"strikingly handsome, middle-aged man\\". Doctor Who Magazine took the stance that the character was a Time Lord known as \\"The Time Meddler\\", the name he is referred to in articles, as well as the comic 4-Dimensional Vistas. In the 1990s, the Virgin Books range of novels referred to the character as \\"Mortimus\\", and used this name exclusively. This was picked up by BBC Books (who took over the Doctor Who publishing rights from Virgin Books), and it was as \\"Mortimus\\" that the character appears in his BBC Books appearances.

The season was soon after Easter; the year may be safely deduced from the fact that the first nine canons are intended to repair havoc wreaked in the church by persecution, which ceased after the overthrow of Maximinus II in 313.. Only about a dozen bishops were present, nonetheless representing nearly every part of Syria and Asia Minor. Either Vitalis, Bishop of Antioch, or Marcellus of Ancyra presided, and possibly both were present, although the Libellus Synodicus, also known as the Synodicon Vetus, assigns to the latter.https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3802.htm The tenth canon tolerates the marriages of deacons who previous to ordination had reserved the right to take a wife. The thirteenth forbids chorepiscopi to ordain presbyters or deacons. The sixteenth canon brackets the Christians who have committed bestiality, or may still have been doing so, into several different groups based on the offender's age, and assigns different penances to each group; married men over 20 were sanctioned more harshly than unmarried youths, and married men over 50 received the harshest sanctions. The seventeenth canon condemns the Christians who have either committed bestiality or had sexual intercourse with a leprous woman, while themselves being leprous, to having to pray with the wintering people - i.e. outside church buildings. The equation of leprous women with beasts is generally considered difficult to interpret. The eighteenth safeguards the right of the people in objecting to the appointment of a bishop whom they do not wish. Canon XXII: Concerning wilful murderers let them remain prostrators; but at the end of life let them be indulged with full communion. Canon XXIV imposes five years of penance upon those who consult magicians.

He was married to the soprano Teresina Brambilla. Life and work Born in Paderno Fasolaro (now Paderno Ponchielli) near Cremona, then Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, Ponchielli won a scholarship at the age of nine to study music at the Milan Conservatory, writing his first symphony by the time he was ten years old. In 1856 he wrote his first opera‚Äîit was based on Alessandro Manzoni's great novel The Betrothed (I promessi sposi)‚Äîand it was as an opera composer that he eventually found fame. His early career was disappointing. Maneuvered out of a professorship at the Milan Conservatory that he had won in a competition, he took small-time jobs in small cities, and composed several operas, none successful at first. In spite of his disappointment, he gained much experience as the bandmaster (capobanda) in Piacenza and Cremona, arranging and composing over 200 works for wind band. Notable among his \\"original\\" compositions for band are the first-ever concerto for euphonium (Concerto per Flicornobasso, 1872), fifteen variations on the popular Parisian song \\"Carnevale di Venezia\\", and a series of festive and funeral marches that resound with the pride of the newly unified Italy and the private grief of his fellow Cremonese. The turning point was the big success of the revised version of I promessi sposi in 1872, which brought him a contract with the music publisher G. Ricordi & Co. and the musical establishment at the Conservatory and at La Scala. The role of Lina in the revised version was sung by Teresina Brambilla whom he married in 1874. Their son Annibale became a music critic and minor composer.Mattera, Angelo (1971). \\"Brambilla, Teresa\\". Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol. 13. Treccani. Online version retrieved 1 February 2015 . The ballet Le due gemelle (1873) confirmed his success. The following opera, I Lituani (The Lithuanians) of 1874, was also well received, being performed later at Saint Petersburg (as Aldona on 20 November 1884). His most well-known opera is La Gioconda (1876), which his librettist Arrigo Boito adapted from the same play by Victor Hugo that had been previously set by Saverio Mercadante as Il giuramento in 1837 and Carlos Gomes as Fosca in 1873. The opera contains the famous ballet Dance of the Hours as the third act finale. It was first produced in 1876 and revised several times. The version that has become popular today was first given in 1880. In 1876 he started working on I Mori di Valenza, although the project dates back to 1873. It was an opera that he never finished, although it was completed later by Arturo Cadore and performed posthumously in 1914. Ponchielli's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, Italy After La Gioconda, Ponchielli wrote the monumental biblical melodrama in four acts Il figliuol prodigo given in Milan at La Scala on 26 December 1880 and Marion Delorme, from another play by Victor Hugo, which was presented at La Scala on 17 March 1885. In spite of their rich musical invention, neither of these operas met with the same success but both exerted great influence on the composers of the rising generation, such as Giacomo Puccini, Pietro Mascagni and Umberto Giordano. In 1881, Ponchielli was appointed maestro di cappella of the Bergamo Cathedral, and from the same year he was a professor of composition at the Milan Conservatory, where among his students were Puccini, Mascagni and Emilio Pizzi. He died of pneumonia in Milan in 1886 and was interred in the city's Monumental Cemetery.Caldini, Sandro 2001, \\"Amilcare Ponchielli‚Äôs Capriccio\\" , in The Double Reed, Vol. 24, No. 1 Legacy A statue of Ponchielli in Cremona, Italy Although in his lifetime Ponchielli was very popular and influential (and introduced an enlarged orchestra and more complex orchestration) only one of his operas is regularly performed today - La Gioconda. It contains a strong and memorable aria for contralto 'Voce de donna o d'angelo'(the Rosary song), the great tenor romanza \\"Cielo e mar\\", a well-known duet for tenor and baritone titled \\"Enzo Grimaldo, Principe Di Santafior\\",Faulkner, Anne Shaw 2005, What we hear in music, p.542, Kessinger Publishing the soprano aria \\"Suicidio!\\", and the ballet \\"The Dance of the Hours\\", which is widely known thanks in part to its having been featured in Walt Disney's Fantasia in 1940, and in Allan Sherman's novelty song, \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\", and numerous other popular works.

He ascended the throne of France upon the death of his brother Francis II in 1560. After decades of tension, war broke out between Protestants and Catholics after the massacre of Vassy in 1562. In 1572, after several unsuccessful peace attempts, Charles ordered the marriage of his sister Margaret of Valois to Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV of France), a major Protestant nobleman in the line of succession to the French throne, in a last desperate bid to reconcile his people. Facing popular hostility against this policy of appeasement, Charles allowed the massacre of all Huguenot leaders who gathered in Paris for the royal wedding at the instigation of his mother Catherine de' Medici. This event, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, was a significant blow to the Huguenot movement, though religious civil warfare soon began anew. Charles sought to take advantage of the disarray of the Huguenots by ordering the Siege of La Rochelle, but was unable to take the Protestant stronghold. All his decisions were influenced by his mother, a fervent Roman Catholic who initially sought peace between Catholics and Protestants but after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre supported the persecution of Huguenots. Charles died of tuberculosis in 1574, without legitimate male issue, and was succeeded by his brother Henry III. Life =Childhood= Portrait of Charles IX shortly after acceding to the throne, by Fran√ßois Clouet He was born Charles Maximilien, third son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici, in the royal chateau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Styled since birth as Duke of Angoul√™me, he was created Duke of Orl√©ans after the death of his older brother Louis, his parents' second son, who had died in infancy on 24 October 1550. The royal children were raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Claude d'Urf√© and Fran√ßoise d'Humi√®res, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers. On 14 May 1564, Charles was presented the Order of the Garter by Henry Carey. =Accession to the throne= His father died in 1559, and was succeeded by his elder brother, King Francis II. After Francis's short rule, the ten-year-old Charles was immediately proclaimed king on 5 December 1560. When Francis II died, the Privy Council appointed his mother, Catherine de' Medici, as governor of France (gouvernante de France), with sweeping powers, at first acting as regent for her young son. On 15 May 1561, Charles was consecrated in the cathedral at Reims. Antoine of Bourbon, himself in line to the French throne and husband to Queen Joan III of Navarre, was appointed Lieutenant-General of France. =First war of religion= Charles' reign was dominated by the French Wars of Religion, which pitted various factions against each other. The Huguenots, the French adherents of Calvinism, had a considerable following among the nobility, while their enemies, later organised into the Catholic League, were led by the House of Guise, a cadet branch of the House of Lorraine. Queen Catherine, though nominally a Catholic, initially tried to steer a middle course between the two factions, attempting to keep (or restore) the peace and augment royal power. =Relations with the Huguenots= The factions had engaged in violence even before Charles's accession: in 1560 a group of Huguenot nobles at Amboise had planned to try to abduct King Francis II and arrest the Catholic leaders Francis, Duke of Guise, and his brother Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. The plot was found out ahead of time, and the Guises were prepared, executing hundreds of Huguenots. This was followed by cases of Protestant iconoclasm and Catholic reprisals.Salmon, p. 124‚Äì137. Sutherland, p. 111‚Äì138. The regent Catherine tried to foster reconciliation at the Colloquy at Poissy and, after that failed, made several concessions to the Huguenots in the Edict of Saint- Germain in January 1562. Nonetheless, war broke out in Wassy on 1 March 1562, when the Duke of Guise and his troops attacked and killed or wounded over 100 Huguenot worshipers and citizens. The tragedy is identified as the first major event in the French Wars of Religion. Louis of Bourbon, Prince of Cond√©, brother of the Lieutenant-General and the suspected architect of the Amboise conspiracy, had already prepared for war and, taking Wassy as the pretext, assumed the role of a protector of Protestantism and began to seize and garrison strategic towns along the Loire Valley. In return, the monarchy revoked the concessions given to the Huguenots. After the military leaders of both sides were either killed or captured in battles at Rouen, Dreux, and Orl√©ans, the regent mediated a truce and issued the Edict of Amboise (1563). =Armed peace= Charles IX as an adult, by Fran√ßois Clouet. The war was followed by four years of an uneasy \\"armed peace\\", during which time Catherine united the factions in the successful effort to recapture Le Havre from the English. After this victory, Charles declared his legal majority in August 1563, formally ending the regency. However, Catherine continued to play a principal role in politics, and often dominated her son. In March 1564, the King and his mother set out from Fontainebleau on a grand tour of France. Their tour spanned two years and brought them through Bar, Lyon, Salon-de- Provence (where they visited Nostradamus), Carcassonne, Toulouse (where the King and his younger brother Henry were confirmed), Bayonne, La Rochelle, and Moulins. During this trip, Charles IX issued the Edict of Roussillon, which standardised 1 January as the first day of the year throughout France. =Second and third war of religion= War again broke out in 1567 after reports of iconoclasm in Flanders prompted Charles to support Catholics there. Huguenots, fearing a Catholic attack was imminent, tried to abduct the king at Meaux, seized various cities, and massacred Catholics at N√Æmes in an action known as the Michelade. The Battle of Saint-Denis resulted in a Huguenot defeat and the death of Anne de Montmorency, the royal commander-in-chief, and the short war ended in 1568 with the Peace of Longjumeau. The privileges granted to Protestants were widely opposed, however, leading to their cancellation and the resumption of war. The Dutch Republic, England and Navarre intervened on the Protestant side, while Spain, Tuscany and Pope Pius V supported the Catholics. Finally, the royal debt and the King's desire to seek a peaceful solution led to yet another truce, the Peace of Saint-Germain- en-Laye in August 1570, which again granted concessions to the Huguenots. =Marriage and children= On 26 November 1570, Charles married Elisabeth of Austria,Saint-Amand/Martin, p. 245. with whom he fathered one daughter, Marie Elisabeth of Valois. In 1573, Charles fathered an illegitimate son, Charles, Duke of Angoul√™me, with his mistress, Marie Touchet.Saint-Amand/Martin, p. 282. =Coligny's ascendancy and the massacre= Royal Monogram After the conclusion of the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1570, the king increasingly came under the influence of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, who had succeeded the slain Prince of Cond√© as leader of Huguenots after the Battle of Jarnac in 1569. Catherine, however, became increasingly fearful of Coligny's unchecked power, especially since he was pursuing an alliance with England and the Dutch. Coligny was also hated by Henry, Duke of Guise, who accused the Admiral of having ordered the assassination of his father Francis of Guise during the siege of Orl√©ans in 1562. During the peace settlement, a marriage was arranged between Charles' sister Margaret of Valois and Henry of Navarre, the future King Henry IV, who was at that time heir to the throne of Navarre and one of the leading Huguenots. Many Huguenot nobles, including Admiral de Coligny, thronged into Paris for the wedding, which was set for 18 August 1572. On 22 August, a failed attempt on Coligny's life put the city in a state of apprehension, as both visiting Huguenots and Parisian Catholics feared an attack by the other side. In this situation, in the early morning of 24 August 1572, the Duke of Guise moved to avenge his father and murdered Coligny in his lodgings. As Coligny's body was thrown into the street, Parisians mutilated the body. The mob action then erupted into the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, a systematic slaughter of Huguenots that was to last five days. Henry of Navarre managed to avoid death by pledging to convert to Catholicism. Over the next few weeks, the disorder spread to more cities across France. In all, up to 10,000 Huguenots were killed in Paris and the provinces.Jouanna et al., 196‚Äì204. Though the massacres weakened Huguenot power, they also reignited war, which only ceased after the Edict of Boulogne in 1573 granted Huguenots amnesty and limited religious freedom. However, the year 1574 saw a failed Huguenot coup at Saint-Germain and successful Huguenot uprisings in Normandy, Poitou and the Rh√¥ne valley, setting the stage for another round of war. =Decline and death= Engraving of Charles IX In the aftermath of the massacre, the king's fragile mental and physical constitution weakened drastically. His moods swung from boasting about the extremity of the massacre to exclamations that the screams of the murdered Huguenots kept ringing in his ears. Frantically, he blamed alternately himself ‚Äì \\"What blood shed! What murders!\\", he cried to his nurse. \\"What evil counsel I have followed! O my God, forgive me... I am lost! I am lost!\\" ‚Äì or his mother ‚Äì \\"Who but you is the cause of all of this? God's blood, you are the cause of it all!\\" Catherine responded by declaring she had a lunatic for a son.Durant, p. 355. Charles' physical condition, tending towards tuberculosis, deteriorated to the point where, by spring of 1574, his hoarse coughing turned bloody and his hemorrhages grew more violent. Charles IX died at the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes, 30 May 1574, aged 23. As his younger brother, Henry, Duke of Anjou, had recently been elected King of Poland and was away from France, their mother Catherine resumed the regency until Henry's return from Poland. Book on hunting Charles had an interest in hunting, and he wrote a book on the subject, La Chasse Royale, which was published long after his death, in 1625. It is a valuable source for those interested in the history of hounds and hunting.Charles IX, La Chasse Royale (1625). In fiction Coin of Charles IX, 1573 Charles IX is a supporting character in Alexandre Dumas's 1845 historical novel Queen Margot, which focuses on the marriage between Henry of Navarre and Margaret of Valois. The book depicts Charles as both a cold- hearted king who takes pleasure in the hunt, and a lonely and vulnerable man, influenced in politics by his relatives and allies. In this work of fiction, he is a frail and sickly ruler, and dies after reading a book poisoned with arsenic, which his mother intended for Henry of Navarre. In the 1994 film, La Reine Margot, directed by Patrice Ch√©reau, which is based on Dumas's novel, Charles is pictured as mentally unstable and sickly. He has a small role in the Doctor Who story \\"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\\", portrayed by Barry Justice. The story portrays him as a kindly but weak-willed king who is dominated by his mother and persuaded by her to authorise the massacre despite his friendship with Coligny. In the first season of the CW show Reign, Charles IX is a recurring character portrayed by Peter Dacunha. He is mentioned, but never shown, in the second season. He becomes a more prominent character in season three before becoming a main character in season four. Charles IX is one of the few characters in the series to have been recast and is now portrayed by Spencer MacPherson. As king, Charles IX shows little enthusiasm for the job. Charles IX appears as a character in the \\"Colloqui di Poissy\\", an historical novel by Agostino di Bondeno (Rome, 2018) Ancestors  See also  *Louis Duret References Sources       Category:1550 births Category:1574 deaths Category:16th-century kings of France Category:Burials at the Basilica of St Denis Category:Ancien R√©gime in France Category:Dauphins of France Category:Dauphins of Viennois Category:Dukes of Angoul√™me Category:French people of the French Wars of Religion Category:House of Valois-Angoul√™me Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece Category:Modern child rulers Category:People from Saint-Germain-en-Laye Category:1560s in France Category:1570s in France ","title":"Charles IX of France"},{"id":"75910","title":"Henry II of France"},{"id":"75912","text":"The Time Lords are an ancient extraterrestrial species in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, of which the series' title character protagonist, the Doctor, is a member and ancestor. Time Lords are so named for their command of time travel technology and their non-linear perception of time. Originally, they were described as a powerful and wise race from the planet Gallifrey, from which the Doctor was a renegade; details beyond this were very limited for the first decade of the series. They later became integral to many episodes and stories as their role in the universe developed. For the first eight years after the series resumed in 2005, the Time Lords were said to have been destroyed during the Last Great Time War at some point between the original series' cancellation in 1989 and the show's revival. In 2013, the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" concerned this supposed destruction and their eventual survival. They developed a culture of custodianship and time-related technologies based on this perception which includes strictly controlled space/time travel machines (known as \\"TARDISes\\") and monitoring devices to travel through time and to prevent time from being subverted or abused‚Äîalthough actual action was described as rare in practice due to their traditional policy of strict non-interference and neutrality. They can act to manipulate timelines of a wide range of events and individuals, so long as they do not cross back into their own timeline. Over subsequent episodes their history, their development of time manipulation, and their internal politics were touched upon, with Time Lord society portrayed as a stagnated ceremony-bound oligarchy and their past having descended into myth and legend. The Doctor became at times an ally, being appointed their president during his fourth, fifth, and twelfth incarnations and assisting them on many other occasions. Creation In an audio commentary recorded for the 2009 DVD release of The War Games (1969), producer Derrick Sherwin mentioned how in a discussion with the serial's co-writer Terrance Dicks the previous day, Dicks was \\"absolutely certain\\" that Sherwin created the Time Lords for the serial, although Sherwin could not remember himself. Later in the commentary, Dicks recalled Sherwin telling him in the discussions with Dicks and Dicks' fellow co-writer Malcolm Hulke that because the Doctor had always been established as being on the run from his own people, that if he has to appeal to them, the Doctor would be in trouble. In a 2016 interview with The Essential Doctor Who magazine, Dicks mentioned how when Sherwin and he were discussing The War Games one day, Sherwin said, \\"He belongs to this mysterious race called the Time Lords, doesn't he?\\" with \\"everything\\" ultimately coming from that discussion. In The War Games DVD commentary, Sherwin mentioned that he recalled hearing about the Time Lords at the beginning of the series, but as no one else remembered this, it \\"might have come out of [his] dreams\\". Elaborating on this genesis in a 2014 interview in Doctor Who Magazine, Sherwin said of The War Games, \\"It was a case of what shall we do, how can we end this? Let's go back to the beginning and say [the Doctor] was a Time Lord, a renegade Time Lord, a pain in the arse for the other Time Lords who stole his TARDIS and buggered off around the universe. So if he's going to be called to book let's bring in the Time Lords.\\" Overview Early on in the series, the Doctor was identified as a human being; however, his home planet, which from the start of the series is explicitly established as not being Earth, was not named. In The War Games (1969), the Doctor's people appeared, who from then on are known as a race called Time Lords, and in Spearhead from Space (1970), the Doctor's earlier description of himself as a human is retconned when the Third Doctor explicitly states that he is not human. In The Time Warrior (1973‚Äì74), the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey, was revealed on screen for the first time. The nature and history of the Time Lords were gradually revealed as the television programme progressed. The Time Lords are considered one of the oldest and most technologically powerful races in the Doctor Who universe. In The Time Warrior, the Time Lords are characterised by Sontaran military intelligence, quoted by Commander Linx, as \\"A race of great technical achievement, but lacking the morale to withstand a determined assault.\\" The Tenth Doctor says in \\"The Sound of Drums\\" (2007) that they are \\"the oldest and most mighty race in the universe\\". In \\"The Witch's Familiar\\" (2015), Davros mentions a prophecy on the Doctor's world that spoke of a hybrid made up of \\"two great warrior races forced together to create a warrior greater than either\\", which is \\"half-Dalek, half-Time Lord\\", while in \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015), the General, while describing the prophecy of the Hybrid, mentions the Time Lords as one of two warrior races along with the Daleks. In \\"Before the Flood\\" (2015), the Fisher King describes the Time Lords as \\"Cowardly, vain curators, who suddenly remembered they had teeth, and became the most warlike race in the galaxy.\\" In the very distant past, the Time Lords fought a genocidal war against the Great Vampires, which led to such a catastrophic loss of life that the Time Lords renounced violence. In The War Games, the Second Doctor mentions that the Time Lords' \\"great powers\\" are hardly ever used due to their policy of non-intervention into the affairs of other planets, and that they instead observe and gather knowledge. Because of this, holding a trial is a \\"very rare\\" event for the Time Lords. Exceptions to this policy are made only in extreme circumstances when they feel they have to, such as where the Doctor calls them for help in the serial. At the start of the 2005 television series, Gallifrey was thought to have been destroyed and the Time Lords functionally extinct as a result of a mutually destructive Time War with the Dalek race; the Ninth Doctor describes his planet as \\"just rocks and dust\\" in \\"The End of the World\\" (2005), and mentions in \\"Dalek\\" (2005) that the Time Lords \\"burnt\\" with the Daleks at the end of the \\"Last Great Time War\\", and the Tenth Doctor tells the Master in \\"The Sound of Drums\\" (2007) that the Time Lords are \\"dead\\" and \\"[a]ll [they've] got is each other.\\" The Doctor describes himself as the last of his kind and says his planet burned on numerous other occasions, as do other individuals, such as the Krillitane Mr Finch in \\"School Reunion\\" (2006). In \\"Father's Day\\" (2005), the Ninth Doctor remarks that before Time Lords were \\"all gone\\", they would have prevented or repaired paradoxes such as that which attracted the Reapers to 1987 Earth. In \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" (2006), the Tenth Doctor mentions, \\"When the Time Lords kept their eye on everything, you could pop between realities, home in time for tea. Then they died, and took it all with them. Walls of reality closed, the worlds were sealed. Everything became that bit less kind.\\" In \\"The Satan Pit\\" (2006), the Tenth Doctor states that his people \\"practically invented black holes. Well, in fact, they did.\\" Both the Beast (in \\"The Satan Pit\\") and the Doctor (in \\"The Sound of Drums\\" and \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", 2011) believe the Doctor ended the War by killing all of the Time Lords and many of the Daleks. The Tenth Doctor's artificially created \\"daughter\\" Jenny is speculated by Donna Noble in \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" (2008) to be a surviving Time Lord, though the Doctor initially rejects the suggestion. Two other Time Lord-like beings appeared in \\"Journey's End\\" (2008): Donna, briefly empowered with the mind and knowledge of a Time Lord, and a half-human clone of the Tenth Doctor. Donna's memories related to the Doctor, as well as her Time Lord knowledge, are buried in order to save her life, while the clone lives out his existence in a parallel universe with Rose Tyler. Seal of The High Council of the Time Lords. \\"The End of Time\\" (2009‚Äì10) shows the High Council of Time Lords, led by Lord President Rassilon, attempting to escape the Time War by materialising Gallifrey in the place of Earth at Christmas. However, the Tenth Doctor destroys the device which allows their passage into the present, sending them back into the events of the Time War. During the episode \\"The Doctor's Wife\\" it is revealed that several Time Lords and their TARDISes had been trapped and destroyed by an entity called House who lived in a separate bubble universe. In \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\" (2011), it is revealed that the daughter of Amy Pond and Rory Williams, Melody Pond (who later goes by her transliterated name \\"River Song\\"), has been born with Time Lord-like genetic traits. An old acquaintance of the Doctor's, Madame Vastra, reminds the Doctor that the Time Lord race developed due to their billions of years' exposure to the time vortex. The Doctor then recalls that Rory and Amy had spent their wedding night in the TARDIS; therefore it is theorised by Vastra that River's conception mirrored that of the Time Lords' genesis and therefore she herself developed Time Lord genetic characteristics. In \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" (2013), it is shown that the Eighth Doctor regenerates into the War Doctor to fight in the Time War. Many years later, as shown during \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013) and also described by the Partisan in \\"The End of Time\\", the War Doctor originally planned to use a Time Lord weapon known as the Moment to destroy the Time Lords and Daleks. However, after being shown the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors during \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", he works together with them to change the assumed outcome of the Time War: thirteen incarnations of the Doctor team up together to freeze Gallifrey in time and place it outside of their universe (protecting it and the remaining Time Lords), while the Daleks destroy themselves in their own crossfire once Gallifrey is gone. The War Doctor does not retain the memory of these events and the Doctor spends centuries believing he burnt Gallifrey until the Eleventh Doctor's time; this is because the time streams are out of sync after the War Doctor meets his future selves and the altered events are only known to the Doctor once they occur in the Eleventh Doctor's experience and become part of his memory. Indeed, earlier on in the episode, both the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctors mistakenly believe that the War Doctor killed all of the Time Lords on the last day of the Time War. After being informed that the plan to save Gallifrey was successful, the Eleventh Doctor sets out to find Gallifrey and restore the Time Lords. In \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", the Doctor visits the planet Trenzalore where he discovers a question being broadcast through all of time and space through a crack in the universe: \\"Doctor Who?\\" The Doctor realizes that the Time Lords are attempting to return to the universe and will come back if he speaks his true name. Due to \\"half the universe\\" surrounding Trenzalore, a siege begins that lasts centuries as the Doctor knows that if the Time Lords return, the Time War will begin anew. With the Doctor on the verge of death, Clara Oswald pleads with the Time Lords through the crack to intervene and save the Doctor. Through the crack, the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, saving his life before sealing the crack again. In \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015), it is revealed that Gallifrey returned to the universe around the time of its end. After escaping his confession dial in \\"Heaven Sent\\" (2015), still furious over the death of Clara Oswald in \\"Face the Raven\\" (2015), the Doctor manages to depose Rassilon‚Äîwho had put the Doctor there to begin with for questioning‚Äîand exile him in \\"Hell Bent\\" before running off again. Physical characteristics The binary vascular system of a Time Lord (from \\"Dalek\\", 2005). Time Lords and human beings look alike, however they differ in many respects. Physiological differences from humans include two hearts which normally beat at 170 beats per minute, three brain stems [S10E06 Extremis], an internal body temperature of 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit) and a \\"respiratory bypass system\\" that allows them to survive strangulation. The Twelfth Doctor was able to survive direct exposure to the vacuum of space in Oxygen. Time Lords also seem to have an increased resilience to higher frequencies of sound, as seen in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" and \\"Partners in Crime\\". If severely injured, Time Lords can go into a healing coma which lowers their body temperature to below freezing which the Doctor did in Planet of the Daleks. In the serial Destiny of the Daleks, Romana was able to voluntarily stop both of her hearts beating, to fool the Daleks into believing that she was dead. The Doctor also shows a greater tolerance to cold compared to humans in The Seeds of Doom and \\"Planet of the Ood\\" and even Romana in The Ribos Operation, and in \\"42\\", the Tenth Doctor states he is able to survive at absolute zero for a short period of time. In \\"World War Three\\", the Doctor is able to shake off an electrocution attempt which is fatal to a number of humans, and appears unaffected by the energy whip wielded by the Sycorax in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\". In \\"Smith and Jones\\" the Tenth Doctor says that the radiation given off by X-rays pose no real threat to Time Lords, and proceeds to absorb an amount that would be lethal to a human, which he subsequently expels through his foot. \\"The End of Time\\" shows the Tenth Doctor as being capable of surviving (for a short period) a massive burst of radiation that would have killed anything else instantly. However, the radiation burst caused enough damage to start a regeneration. Time Lords are extremely long-lived, routinely counting their ages in terms of centuries; the Second Doctor claimed in The War Games that Time Lords could live \\"practically forever, barring accidents.\\" The series has suggested that Time Lords have a different concept of ageing from humans. In Pyramids of Mars, the Fourth Doctor considers an age of 750 years to be \\"middle-aged\\". In \\"The Stolen Earth\\", the Tenth Doctor refers to when his original incarnation was a \\"kid\\" at 90 years old. However, within a specific incarnation, a Time Lord is able to age, albeit much more slowly than a human. The War Doctor and Eleventh Doctor, over the course of the Last Great Time War and the Battle of Trenzalore, respectively, are seen to age within their respective incarnations to what would appear to a human to be old age; both conflicts are suggested within the series to last hundreds if not thousands of Earth years. In The Daleks' Master Plan, the First Doctor is able to resist the effects of the Time Destructor better than his companions, who are visibly aged by it; one of them, Sara Kingdom, ages to dust before the Destructor device can be reversed. The Fourth Doctor is briefly aged 500 years in The Leisure Hive, leaving him an old man but still active. A similar situation occurred in \\"The Sound of Drums\\", where the Master uses specially made technology to age the Tenth Doctor by a century, leaving him in a frail and helpless state. A further application of this technology in the following episode, \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", suspends the Doctor's capacity to regenerate, showing the effects of 900 years of life without regeneration. In The Two Doctors, the Second Doctor states that the \\"Rassilon Imprimatur\\" allows Time Lords to safely travel through time, becoming symbionts with their TARDISes, and that the reason other species are incapable of developing time travel is that they lack the imprimatur. However, he implies later that he was lying about at least some of this information to mislead the Sontarans. At the beginning of The Trial of a Time Lord, the Sixth Doctor suggests that a number of elder Time Lords were able to use their combined mental energy to summon his TARDIS against his will. Time Lords can survive, but not function properly, without two hearts. In \\"The Shakespeare Code\\", the Tenth Doctor has only one heart working. He knows this and tries and fails to stand up, until both of them start working again. Also, in \\"The Power of Three\\", after a massive electric current is passed through the Eleventh Doctor, he is left with only one heart in working condition and is unable to carry on for a long period of time. In \\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\\", the Tenth Doctor is able to overcome the effects of cyanide by \\"stimulating the inhibited enzymes into reversal\\", a process he referred to as going through \\"detox\\". In the episode \\"Cold Blood\\", the Eleventh Doctor experiences excruciating pain when the Silurian attempts to decontaminate him of surface bacteria. The Doctor states this would kill him, most likely due to the scanners being programmed to \\"detox\\" humans and therefore being unaware of what elements the Doctor requires. A Time Lord is able to conceal their Time Lord nature, and become a human, by using the Chameleon Arch ‚Äì a device that stores their \\"essence\\" and memories in an innocuous device such as a fob watch, and replaces them with false counterparts until the object is later re-opened. The process allows them to disguise themselves as humans physiologically and psychologically, meaning they only have one heart and are stripped of non-human powers, and of any memory of having been a Time Lord. This story element was notably featured in Series 3; the Doctor uses it to hide himself from the Family of Blood and becomes a schoolteacher in Edwardian England. His nemesis the Master used it to disguise himself as a human to escape the Time War. The story element is later revisited in the Series 12 episode \\"Fugitive of the Judoon\\" when a mysterious, unknown incarnation of the Doctor (played by Jo Martin), is revealed to have been hiding on Earth as a tour guide named ‚ÄúRuth Clayton‚Äù using a Chameleon Arch. =Mental powers= Time Lords can communicate by telepathy, and can link their minds to share information and enhance their powers. In Castrovalva, the Doctor activates the TARDIS' Zero Room mentally. Additionally, both the Doctor and the Master demonstrate significant hypnotic abilities which may be supplemented by their telepathic abilities. These powers were elaborated upon from 2005. The Eleventh Doctor is seen using this method to query a cat about the goings-on of the flat in \\"The Lodger\\". In \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\" and \\"Closing Time\\" he is apparently able to even understand babies, as well as horses in \\"A Town Called Mercy\\". In \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\", the Tenth Doctor reads the mind of Madame de Pompadour‚Äîand in the process, to his surprise, she is able to read his mind as well. In Paul Cornell's Virgin New Adventures novel Love and War, the Doctor uses a similar method to read the mind of his companion Bernice Summerfield. In \\"The End of Time\\", the Master uses the same technique, allowing the Tenth Doctor to hear the drumming sound the Master constantly hears. The Doctor later displays his telepathic communion powers in \\"Fear Her\\" and in \\"The Shakespeare Code\\", where by using his mind melding technique he is partially able to relieve a man of his mental illness as he traces back through his memories. In \\"Planet of the Ood\\", the Tenth Doctor seems able to temporarily confer some degree of telepathy on his companion Donna Noble, so that she can hear the telepathic song of the Ood. When she is unable to bear the song, the Doctor removes the ability. This telepathic ability is also extended to other alien species to some extent. In the same episode, he is able to \\"hear\\" the Ood's telepathic song where the humans could not. In \\"The Lodger\\", the Eleventh Doctor (pressed for time and needing to convey a great deal of information to someone) smashed his forehead into another person's forehead, causing a massive instantaneous transfer of information. He then commented that was just the general background, then repeats the action to transfer further information pertinent to the episode. The Doctor also contacts the Time Lords by going into a trance and creating an assembling box in The War Games. In The Two Doctors, the Doctor engages in astral projection, but warns that if he is disturbed while doing so, his mind could become severed from his body and he could die. In \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", the Doctor telepathically interfaces with a network tapped into the human population who collectively chant his name. The focus of psychic energy granted the Doctor the ability to de-age himself, float through the air, deflect shots from the Master's laser screwdriver, and telekinetically disarm the Master. In addition, Time Lords may be clairvoyant, or have additional time-related senses. In The Time Monster, and Invasion of the Dinosaurs, the Third Doctor is able to resist fields of slow time, being able to move through them even though others are paralysed. In City of Death, both the Fourth Doctor and Romana notice distortions and jumps in time that no one else does. In the 2010 episode \\"The Lodger\\", the Eleventh Doctor is the only one to notice (and remain free of) the time loops caused by the activation of the Time Engine. In the 2005 series, the Ninth Doctor claims that he can sense the movement of the Earth through space as well as being able to perceive the past and all possible futures. He is also able to concentrate and time his motions well enough to step safely through the blades of a rapidly spinning fan, and later claims that if any Time Lords still existed, he would be able to sense them. As the Tenth Doctor he repeats this assertion, adding also that he is somehow innately able to sense which events in time are 'fixed' and which are in 'flux'. The Eleventh Doctor slightly amends what was said earlier in \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", saying that he could only sense if there were other Time Lords in this universe. In the original series episode Warriors' Gate, Romana is called a 'time-sensitive' by a marauding slaver and, though she seems to deny this, is able to interface with his spaceship in ways that only a 'time-sensitive' is supposed to be able to. In \\"Utopia\\", the Tenth Doctor states that he finds it difficult to look at Captain Jack Harkness because Jack's existence has become fixed in time and space. In the Series 4 episode \\"Journey's End\\", the Tenth Doctor was shown to use his telepathic abilities to wipe Donna Noble's mind of certain memories, specifically the memories of her travels in the TARDIS and to 'implant' a defence mechanism which is activated in \\"The End of Time\\". The War Games showed that other Time Lords are also able to erase people's memories, as in that story, Jamie and Zoe's travels with the Doctor were erased from their memory, and the council of Time Lords also put a memory block on the Doctor so he could not pilot the TARDIS. In the Series 5 episode \\"The Big Bang\\" the Doctor telepathically left a message in Amy Pond's head before sealing her into the Pandorica so that she would know what was happening when she woke up. Time Lords, or at least the Doctor, can read extremely quickly. =Regeneration= The Fourth Doctor regenerates into the Fifth Doctor (from Logopolis, 1981). Time Lords also have the ability to regenerate their bodies when their current body is mortally wounded. This process results in their body undergoing a transformation, gaining a new physical form and a new personality; a Time Lord who was pleasant and polite in his previous regeneration might express surprise when his new form turns out to be prone to saying rude things. Regenerations can be traumatic. In Castrovalva, the Fifth Doctor requires the use of a Zero Room, a chamber shielded from the outside universe that provides an area of calm for him to recuperate. He comments that there is an excellent polygonal zero room beneath the junior senate block on Gallifrey. The Time Lord's personality also sometimes goes through a period of instability following a regeneration. It was first stated in The Deadly Assassin that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times (thirteen incarnations in all). There were exceptions to this rule, however: when the Master reached the end of his regenerative cycle, he took possession of the body of another person to continue living. In The Five Doctors, the Master was offered a new cycle of regenerations by the High Council to save the Doctor from the Death Zone, which may indicate that there are methods to circumvent the twelve regeneration limit. The Master says in \\"The Sound of Drums\\" that the Time Lords \\"resurrected\\" him to fight in the Time War. It was revealed in The Brain of Morbius that the Time Lords also use the Elixir of Life in extreme cases, where regeneration is not possible. It is confirmed in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" that a Time Lord can normally regenerate only twelve times but that the Time Lords have the ability to grant more regenerations: at the behest of Clara Oswald they granted the Doctor himself a new cycle when he was at the point of death from old age, having used up his entire cycle. Also in The Deadly Assassin, several Time Lords including the President are stated to have been \\"murdered\\" and are not stated to have regenerated. Regeneration, regardless of how many regenerations the individual Time Lord has already undergone, is a conditional and non-inevitable phenomenon. This is stated in \\"The End of Time\\" when the Tenth Doctor explains to Wilfred Mott that a Time Lord can die before they have a chance to regenerate, in which case they die outright. In The Deadly Assassin at least one of the murders was carried out with a 'staser', possibly a weapon designed to both kill and prevent regeneration (stasers are also stated to have little effect on non-living tissue). In the Series 4 episode \\"Turn Left\\", the Tenth Doctor's body is shown on a stretcher following the parallel events of \\"The Runaway Bride\\". A UNIT officer states that the Doctor's death must have been too quick to allow for regeneration. In Destiny of the Daleks, Romana showed the ability to rapidly change form several times in a row during her first regeneration, and apparently had the ability to change into whatever appearance she desired. When the Doctor remarks upon her ability, she comments that he should have stayed in university. However, despite showing several appearances, Romana regenerated only once on that occasion. In \\"Utopia\\", the Master, just before regeneration, claimed that he would become \\"young and strong\\", implying that he could choose the form of his new body. The human-Time Lord hybrid River Song in \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" claimed she was \\"focusing on a dress size\\", but subsequently weighed herself, seeming unsure of how her new body had truly developed. The Doctor said on several occasions he wished he was \\"ginger\\", which he has seemed unable to control in previous regenerations. In \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", when the Master is fatally wounded, he chooses not to regenerate, essentially committing suicide rather than regenerate and be kept prisoner by the Doctor forever. This again implies that regeneration is not inevitable and can indeed be refused. Upon encountering the remains of fellow Time Lord the Corsair in \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", the Doctor refers to the Corsair as both male and female, hinting that Time Lords can switch genders upon their regenerations; this is confirmed in \\"Dark Water\\", in which the Master, previously seen in various male incarnations for over forty years, returned as a female. The Thirteenth Doctor also regenerated as a woman in \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\". Whether or not Time Lords can recognise each other across regenerations is not made entirely clear: * In The War Games, the War Chief recognises the Second Doctor despite his regeneration and it is stated that they know each other when they first meet. * In Terror of the Autons, the Third Doctor fails to recognise The Master's voice, when the Master speaks to him on a telephone. * In The Three Doctors, the Second Doctor recognises the Third Doctor immediately, despite the fact that the Third Doctor is a future incarnation of himself. Omega is similarly able to recognise the two Doctors as the same man. * In Planet of the Spiders, the Third Doctor has trouble recognising his former mentor. * In The Deadly Assassin, Announcer Runcible, an old classmate, recognises the Fourth Doctor despite his changes in appearance and mentions that the Doctor appears to have had a \\"face lift\\" since they last met. * In The Armageddon Factor, Drax, another alumnus immediately recognises the Fourth Doctor, though the Doctor does not recognise him. * In The Five Doctors, the Third Doctor is unable to initially recognise the Master in his non-Gallifreyan body. * In The Twin Dilemma, the Doctor's old friend Azmael fails to recognise him, as the Doctor has regenerated twice since their last encounter. * In The Two Doctors, when the Sixth Doctor and Second Doctor first meet, they are initially quiet until they face each other and simultaneously yell at each other, each recognising immediately the other. * In Survival, the Master recognises the Seventh Doctor on sight. * In Doctor Who (1996), the Eighth Doctor is unable to recognise the Master while he possesses a human body, only recognising the Master when he corrects Grace's grammar. * In \\"Utopia\\", the Tenth Doctor does not recognise the human form of the Master, although the Doctor did recognise him, and name him \\"Master\\", as soon as he recovered his Time Lord physiology and mind. * In \\"The Sound of Drums\\", the Doctor states that Time Lords can \\"always\\" recognise each other, although, while on Earth, the Master used satellites with a telepathic network to mask his presence from the Doctor. The Doctor in this circumstance appears to only be referring to recognition of the individual as a Time Lord, not necessarily the specific identity. However, when he sees the Master on television, he recognises him. * In \\"Time Crash\\", the Fifth Doctor could not instinctively recognise that the Tenth Doctor was a Time Lord, much less one of his own later incarnations. * In \\"The Next Doctor\\", the Tenth Doctor initially seems unable to detect that the human Jackson Lake, who identifies himself as the Doctor, is not actually his regenerated future self. * In \\"The End of Time\\", the Doctor immediately recognises an unidentified elderly female Time Lord on sight, and also refers to the lead Time Lord by the name Rassilon (an earlier incarnation of Rassilon had appeared in \\"The Five Doctors\\"). In the context of the story, however, he may have encountered both during the Time War, though he himself has regenerated since they last saw him. Rassilon and the woman recognised the Doctor on sight as well, but the Doctor's presence, regardless of incarnation, was expected. * In \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", the War Doctor recognises neither the Tenth Doctor nor the Eleventh, initially assuming them to be future companions. Likewise, earlier on, when the Tenth and Eleventh Doctor's first meet, the Tenth Doctor does not recognise his successor at first, but after the Eleventh Doctor's reaction upon seeing him, he is quick to realise who the Eleventh Doctor is. * In \\"Dark Water\\", the Twelfth Doctor is unable to recognise the Master until she reveals her identity. *In \\"Spyfall\\", the Thirteenth Doctor is unable to recognize the Master until he tells her. In \\"Turn Left\\", the Tenth Doctor is killed in his own rampage against the Racnoss without Donna to stop him and ultimately save his life. A UNIT soldier speculates that he died \\"too fast for him to regenerate\\". In \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\", a future version of the Eleventh Doctor is shot, causing him to begin his regeneration cycle. He is shot again before the regeneration completes, causing him to die instantly. However, in \\"The Wedding of River Song\\", it is revealed this was a shape shifting android the Doctor used to fake his death, making this questionable. In cases of non- fatal injury, Time Lords who have recently regenerated can use left over cellular energy to heal and even regrow severed limbs, as seen in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" where the Tenth Doctor regrows a hand. Also seen in \\"Journey's End\\", is the apparent ability to siphon off regeneration energy in order to cancel the effect of changing appearance; which requires them to have a \\"bio-matching receptacle\\" (in this case the Doctor's severed hand), which is usually impractical. However, this \\"non-regeneration\\" was revealed as \\"counting\\" towards the Doctor's twelve possible regenerations during the events of \\"The Time of the Doctor\\". In \\"The End of Time\\", the Tenth Doctor was able to postpone his regeneration long enough so that he could travel in time and space to see his past companions for one last time before he regenerated. The Fifth Doctor also showed a similar ability in his final televised story The Caves of Androzani. Toward the end of episode 3 he is seen, apparently, fighting off the effects of an impending regeneration so he can return to Androzani Minor to save his companion Peri. Time Lords appear to have the ability to stay conscious for moments after events that would outright kill other lifeforms instantly, giving them the opportunity to regenerate. In Logopolis, the Fourth Doctor falls hundreds of feet to the ground, yet is still conscious and able to talk to his companions when they find him minutes later before he regenerates. In The Caves of Androzani, the Fifth Doctor remains conscious throughout the entire course of his (eventually fatal) spectrox toxaemia, while his human companion Peri loses consciousness as the disease worsens. In \\"The Stolen Earth\\", the Tenth Doctor is shot by a Dalek's energy weapon, which has almost always been shown to instantly kill any other lifeform, yet is still conscious and able to return, with some assistance, to the TARDIS in order to regenerate. However, he was skimmed by the energy shot, while all others were shot in the middle of the back or in the chest, closer to vital organs. The Eleventh Doctor is also shot squarely by a weakened Dalek in \\"The Big Bang\\" and severely injured, but he manages to execute his plan to restart the universe nonetheless. In Death of the Doctor (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor responds to a question from Clyde Langer by saying he can regenerate \\"507\\" times. Early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations. Writer Russell T Davies stated in an interview with SFX that the line was not intended to be taken seriously and is instead a commentary. He said that the \\"thirteen lives\\" rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it. It is revealed in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" that this was in fact false and that due to his various regenerations, the Eleventh Doctor was in fact his last incarnation. However, the Time Lords intervened through a crack in time to grant him a full new regeneration cycle. Culture and society The Time Lord homeworld, Gallifrey, is an Earth-like planet in the fictional constellation of Kasterborous. Its capital city is referred to as the Citadel, and contains the Capitol, the seat of Time Lord government. At the centre of the Capitol is the Panopticon, beneath which is the Eye of Harmony. Outside the Capitol lie wastelands where the \\"Outsiders\\", Time Lords who have dropped out of Time Lord society, live in less technologically advanced communities, shunning life in the cities as revealed in The Invasion of Time. The Doctor Who Roleplaying Game by FASA equates the Outsiders with the \\"Shobogans\\", a group mentioned briefly in The Deadly Assassin as being responsible for acts of vandalism around the Panopticon, but there is actually nothing on screen that explicitly connects the two. In \\"The Timeless Children\\" (2020), it is revealed that the Shobogans were the first race of peoples who resided on Gallifrey, only becoming the Time Lords after gene-splicing the ability to regenerate from the Doctor. Romana and the Doctor have also referred to \\"Time Tots\\", or infant Time Lords, and (in \\"Smith and Jones\\") the Doctor refers his compatriots and he playing \\"with R√∂ntgen bricks in the nursery\\". In \\"The Sound of Drums\\", the Master is seen as a child, apparently at the age of 8. In general, the Time Lords are an aloof people, with a society full of pomp and ceremony. The Doctor has observed that his people \\"enjoy making speeches\\" and have an \\"infinite capacity for pretension\\". The Time Lord penchant for ceremony extends to their technology, with various artefacts given weighty names like the Hand of Omega, the Eye of Harmony and the Key of Rassilon. The Sixth Doctor has also characterised the Time Lords as a stagnant and corrupt society, a state caused by ten million years of absolute power. Sutekh the Osiran decries them as \\"a perfidious species,\\" while Brother Lassar, in the episode \\"School Reunion\\", describes the Time Lords as \\"a pompous race\\" of \\"ancient, dusty senators... frightened of change and chaos\\" and \\"peaceful to the point of indolence\\". Their portrayal in the series is reminiscent of academics living in ivory towers, unconcerned with external affairs. The Doctor states that the Time Lords were sworn never to interfere, only to watch. It has been suggested that, since perfecting the science of time travel, they have withdrawn, bound by the moral complexity of interfering in the natural flow of history; in Earthshock, the Cyberleader, when notified of the arrival of a TARDIS, is surprised at the presence of a Time Lord, stating \\"they are forbidden to interfere\\". In The Two Doctors, it is suggested that Time Lords are responsible for maintaining a general balance of power between the races of the Universe. While interference is apparently against Time Lord policy, there are occasions when they do intervene, albeit indirectly through their CIA or Celestial Intervention Agency. The CIA has occasionally sent the Doctor on missions that required plausible deniability, as in The Two Doctors, and sometimes against his will, as in Colony in Space and The Monster of Peladon. He is also sent on a mission in The Mutants which was intended to help preserve the existence of a unique race, which was being destroyed by the excesses of the Earth empire. The Doctor's mission in Genesis of the Daleks even involves changing history to avert the creation of the Daleks, or at least temper their aggressiveness. Children of Gallifrey are taken from their families at the age of 8 and admitted into the Academy. Novices are then taken to an initiation ceremony before the Untempered Schism, a gap in the fabric of reality that looks into the time vortex. Of those that stare into it, some are inspired, some run away and others go mad. The Doctor suggests that the Master went mad, while admitting that he ran away. Each Time Lord belongs to one of a number of various colleges or chapters, such as the Patrexes, Arcalian, and the Prydonian chapters, which have ceremonial and possibly political significance. In The Deadly Assassin, it is explained that each chapter has its own colours; the Prydonians wear scarlet and orange, the Arcalians wear green, and the Patrexeans wear heliotrope. However, in that same serial, Cardinal Borusa, described as \\"the leader of the Prydonian chapter\\", wears heliotrope. Other Prydonians wear orange headdresses with orange-brown (not scarlet) robes. Other chapters mentioned in spin-off novels include the Dromeian and Cerulean chapters. The Prydonian chapter has a reputation for being devious, and tends to produce renegades; the Doctor, the Master and the Rani are all Prydonians. The colleges of the Academy are led by the Cardinals. Ushers, who provide security and assistance at official Time Lord functions, may belong to any chapter, and wear all-gold uniforms. Also mentioned in The Deadly Assassin are 'plebeian classes'. The executive political leadership is split between the Lord President, who keeps the ceremonial relics of the Time Lords, and the Chancellor, who appears to be the administrative leader of the Cardinals and who acts as a check on the power of the Lord President. The President is an elected position; on Presidential Resignation Day, the outgoing President usually names his successor, who is then usually confirmed in a non-contested \\"election\\", but it is still constitutionally possible for another candidate to put themselves forward for the post, as the Doctor did in The Deadly Assassin. In that story, the Presidency was described as a largely ceremonial role, but in The Invasion of Time the orders of the office were to be obeyed without question. In the event the current Lord President is unable to name a successor, the council can appoint a President to take his place. In The Five Doctors, the council appoints the Doctor as president after Borusa is imprisoned by Rassilon, and later deposed him after he neglected his duties. The President and Chancellor also sit on the Time Lord High Council, akin to a legislative body, composed variously of Councillors and more senior Cardinals. Also on the High Council is the Castellan of the Chancellery Guard, in charge of the security of the Citadel, whom the Doctor has referred to as the leader of a trumped-up palace guard. According to the constitution, if while in emergency session the other members of the High Council are in unanimous agreement, even the President's orders can be overruled. Technology The Moment was claimed by the Time Lords to be the most powerful weapon in the Universe and capable of destroying entire galaxies. The Moment was locked in Gallifrey's Time Vaults, specifically in the Omega Arsenal. The Moment is so powerful that the weapon's operating system became sentient, leading the Time Lords to wonder \\"How do you use a weapon when it can stand in judgement of you?\\" and that \\"only one man would be mad enough to try it\\". In the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", the War Doctor breaks into the Omega Arsenal, steals the Moment and is about to destroy both Time Lords and Daleks alike to stop the Time War before the Moment engineers a meeting with his succeeding regenerations to convince him otherwise. Another impressive example of Time Lord technology is the Eye of Harmony, a repurposed black hole singularity contained within the instrumentality below the Panopticon. This is the source of their power and the anchor of the Web of Time itself, created by Rassilon and the co-founders of Time Lord society in the distant past. The Time Lords were accomplished stellar engineers and could control the development of stars with devices like the Hand of Omega, which was shown to be capable of forcing a star to go supernova. The Eye of Harmony exists within the Doctor's TARDIS as a collapsing star suspended in a permanent state of decay, hence harnessing the potential energy of a collapse that would never occur. Whether these are all aspects of the Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey or individual stars in their own right is not made clear on screen. Paradoxically, although the Time Lords are a scientifically and technologically advanced race, the civilisation is so old that key pieces of their technology have become shrouded in legend and myth. In the spin-off fiction, an edict and general aversion against exploring Gallifrey's past also contributes to this. Accordingly, until the Master rediscovers it, the Time Lords forgot that the location of the Eye of Harmony is beneath their capital. They also treated such ceremonial symbols as the Key and Sash of Rassilon as mere historical curiosities, being unaware of their true function. In the revived series, there were instances in which evil alien species have stolen Time Lord technology for their own purposes but such is its complexity that they are unable to operate it, as illustrated in \\"Doomsday\\" when the Genesis Ark was stolen by the Daleks and even they could not open it. Furthermore, the Genesis Ark was just one Time Lord prison that held millions of Daleks, demonstrating \\"bigger on the inside than it is on the outside\\" Time Lord technology. The classic series also makes reference to the inability of other races to successfully use Time Lord technology, with The Two Doctors stating that even if a race managed to copy and build their own TARDISes, they would be ripped apart by the molecular stresses of time travel as all TARDISes have a fail-deadly approach to unauthorised use unless primed with a Rassilon Imprimatur, creating a symbiotic link to a specific Time Lord. The great defence system of Gallifrey is a quantum forcefield known as the Transduction Barrier, a perfect defence shield preventing all matter and energy, even TARDISes, from passing through without authorisation. The Time Lords are further protected by phasing the entire region around Gallifrey into a temporal domain known as Inner Time, effectively separating the homeworld from interaction with the rest of the Universe. During the final hours of the Time War, the High Council of Gallifrey refer to defenses called 'Sky Trenches' which appear to be at least somewhat effective against invading Daleks and/or their ships, as seen in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". TARDISes are characterised not just by their ability to travel in time, but also their dimensionally transcendent nature. A TARDIS' interior spaces exist in a different dimension from its exterior, allowing it to appear to be bigger on the inside. The Doctor states that transdimensional engineering was a key Time Lord discovery in The Robots of Death. In the Ninth and Tenth Doctors' episodes, the TARDIS has an organic look, and the Doctor states in \\"The Impossible Planet\\" that TARDISes are grown, not made. It is seen in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" that as a TARDIS dies, its 'dimension dams' can break down causing a 'size leak' wherein the exterior dimensions of a TARDIS begin to expand to match its inner dimensions. Fitting their generally defensive nature, Time Lord weapons technology is rarely seen, other than the staser hand weapons used by the Guard within the Capitol. Stasers (possibly a portmanteau of stunner and laser, as they are used to stun targets) can be lethal energy weapons, specifically designed to prevent the unwanted regeneration of rogue Time Lords; staser beams also shatter the crystalline structure of non-organic targets. Standard TARDISes do not generally seem to use any on-board weaponry, although War or Battle TARDISes (armed with \\"time torpedoes\\" that freeze their target in time) have appeared in the spin-off media. In the novels, the Eighth Doctor's companion Compassion, a living TARDIS, has enough firepower to annihilate other TARDISes. In the serial Castrovalva, the Master's TARDIS is equipped with an energy field that he uses to temporarily disable or stun several human security guards outside the vessel. One exception to the Time Lords' defensive weaponry is the de-mat gun (or dematerialisation gun). The de-mat gun is a weapon of mass destruction that removes its target from space- time altogether, as seen in The Invasion of Time. The de-mat gun was created in Rassilon's time and is a closely guarded secret; the knowledge to create one is kept in the Matrix and is available only to the President. To make sure this knowledge is not abused, the only way to arm a de-mat gun is by means of the Great Key of Rassilon, whose location is only known to the Chancellor. As a means of extreme sanction, the Time Lords have also been known to place whole planets into time-loops, isolating them from the universe in one repeating moment of time as well as hurling planets from one galaxy to another using a weapon referred only as a magnetron in The Trial of a Time Lord. In the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Ancestor Cell by Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, the Time Lords are shown to house other weapons of mass destruction in a stable time eddy known as the Slaughterhouse. In the Doctor Who Annual 2006, a section by Russell T Davies says that during the Time War, the Time Lords used Bowships (used against the Great Vampires in an ancient war), Black Hole Carriers and N-Forms (war machines first mentioned in the Virgin New Adventures novel Damaged Goods, written by Davies). In \\"The End of Time\\", Rassilon is shown wearing a gauntlet with several powers, primarily the ability to disintegrate a target and the ability to reverse changes made to the human race by the Master. When Rassilon throws the white point star into the hologram of the Earth, the diamond is able to arrive at the planet by following the Master's signal, travelling through the time-locked war to the post-war universe. Gallifreyan paintings were unique in that they were in 3D, as they acted as snapshots of a single moment in time by use of stasis cubes. This meant that they could be used as rudimentary time travel, by freezing a person inside a painting and then letting them out at the required point in time. An example of this is Gallifrey Falls No More as seen in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". History The Dark Tower in the Death Zone on Gallifrey Details of the Time Lords' history within the show are sketchy and are fraught with supposition and contradiction. The Time Lords became the masters of time travel when one of their number, the scientist Omega, created an energy source to power their experiments in time. To this end, Omega used a stellar manipulation device, the Hand of Omega, to rework a nearby star into a new form to serve that source. Unfortunately, the star flared, first into a supernova, and then collapsed into a black hole. Omega was thought killed in that explosion but unknown to everyone, had somehow survived in an anti-matter universe beyond the black hole's singularity. Rassilon, the ultimate founder of Time Lord society, then took a singularity (assumed by fans and the spin- off media to be the same one as Omega's) and placed it beneath the Time Lords' citadel on Gallifrey. This perfectly balanced Eye of Harmony then served as the power source for their civilisation as well as their time machines. At some point in their history the Time Lords interacted with the civilisation of the planet Minyos, giving them advanced technology (including the ability to \\"regenerate\\" to a limited degree, by rejuvenating their bodies when they grow too old). This met with disastrous results, (which is said by some to be the reason the Time Lords adopted a philosophy of \\"non-interference\\"). The Minyans destroyed themselves in a series of nuclear wars.This is said to have been the reason the Time Lords established a \\"non-interference\\" code. In \\"Dalek\\" (2005), the Ninth Doctor explains that his people perished along with the Dalek race in the \\"Last Great Time War\\", leaving the Doctor the last of his race. In \\"The Satan Pit\\" (2006), the Beast identifies the Tenth Doctor as \\"[t]he killer of his own kind.\\" In \\"The Sound of Drums\\" (2007), the Master reveals he escaped the war by turning himself into a human following the Dalek Emperor taking control of the Cruciform. In \\"The End of Time\\" (2009‚Äì10), the Time Lords, after attempting to break out the time lock of the Time War and become creatures of consciousness, are shown being sent back into the War on the last day through the Tenth Doctor's intervention. The Master also disappears along with them. Rassilon describes Time Lord history in this story as having lasted \\"a billion years\\" up until the end of the Time War. In \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013), thirteen incarnations of the Doctor are shown successfully attempting to freeze the Time Lords and their home world of Gallifrey in time, by transporting them to a \\"parallel pocket universe\\" using their TARDISes. Because the time streams are out of sync, the Doctor does not retain the memory of this until his eleventh incarnation. Indeed, earlier on in the episode, both the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctors mistakenly believe that the War Doctor killed all of the Time Lords on the last day of the Time War. While the plan is being outlined, the War Doctor notes that to the rest of the universe, it only appears as if the Time Lords and Daleks had mutually destroyed each other, when in fact, the Daleks had fired upon themselves in the crossfire after Gallifrey vanished, ending in the destruction of most of their own race, but not the Time Lords. In \\"Death in Heaven\\" (2014), the Master, now regenerated into a female form called \\"Missy\\", explains that when the Doctor saved Gallifrey, this caused the Doctor to save her as well. She bluffs the Twelfth Doctor into thinking that Gallifrey has returned to its original co-ordinates, but when the Doctor goes looking, he finds nothing there. In \\"Face the Raven\\" (2015), the immortal Ashildr makes a deal to have the Doctor's TARDIS keys and confession dial taken and to teleport the Twelfth Doctor away in exchange for her trap street's safety. In \\"Heaven Sent\\" (2015), the Twelfth Doctor escapes his confession dial and finds himself near the Citadel on Gallifrey. He tells a young child to inform the Time Lords that he knows what they have done and that he has returned \\"the long way around\\". He then tells the Time Lords through his confession dial the hybrid they fear \\"is me\\". In \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015), Gallifrey is revealed to have come back from the pocket universe it was frozen in and exist at the end of the universe. Rassilon is revealed to have been the one who had the Doctor teleported into the confession dial. In \\"Spyfall\\" (2020), the whole society has been destroyed with the Master claiming responsibility because he claims their society was built on lies regarding the \\"Timeless Child\\".

It is similar to the alternative medicine practice of electromagnetic therapy, which uses a magnetic field generated by an electrically powered device. Practitioners claim that subjecting certain parts of the body to weak electric or magnetic fields has beneficial health effects. These physical and biological claims are unproven and no effects on health or healing have been established.Quackwear: Big Pseudoscience Wants to Sell You Wearable Metal to Improve Your Health; Alternet; January 10, 2015. Although hemoglobin, the blood protein that carries oxygen, is weakly diamagnetic (when oxygenated) or paramagnetic (when deoxygenated), the magnets used in magnetic therapy are many orders of magnitude too weak to have any measurable effect on blood flow. This is not to be confused with transcranial magnetic stimulation, a scientifically valid form of therapy.  Methods of application  Magnetite ring. Magnet therapy involves applying the weak magnetic field of permanent magnets to the body, for purported health benefits. Different effects are assigned to different orientations of the magnet. Products include magnetic bracelets and jewelry; magnetic straps for wrists, ankles, knees, and back; shoe insoles; mattresses; magnetic blankets (blankets with magnets woven into the material); magnetic creams; magnetic supplements; plasters/patches and water that has been \\"magnetized\\". Application is usually performed by the patient. It is similar to the alternative medicine practice of electromagnetic therapy, which uses the weak electric or magnetic fields as well, but generated by electrically powered devices.  Suggested mechanisms of action  Perhaps the most common suggested mechanism is that magnets might improve blood flow in underlying tissues. The field surrounding magnet therapy devices is far too weak and falls off with distance far too quickly to appreciably affect hemoglobin, other blood components, muscle tissue, bones, blood vessels, or organs. A 1991 study on humans of static field strengths up to 1 T found no effect on local blood flow. Tissue oxygenation is similarly unaffected. Some practitioners claim that the magnets can restore the body's hypothetical \\"electromagnetic energy balance\\", but no such balance is medically recognized. Even in the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, which are many times stronger, none of the claimed effects are observed. If the body were meaningfully affected by the weak magnets used in magnet therapy, MRI would be impractical.  Efficacy  Several studies have been conducted in recent years to investigate what role, if any, static magnetic fields may play in health and healing. Unbiased studies of magnetic therapy are problematic, since magnetisation can be easily detected, for instance, by the attraction forces on ferrous (iron-containing) objects; because of this, effective blinding of studies (where neither patients nor assessors know who is receiving treatment versus placebo) is difficult. Incomplete or insufficient blinding tends to exaggerate treatment effects, particularly where any such effects are small. Health claims regarding longevity and cancer treatment are implausible and unsupported by any research. More mundane health claims, most commonly about anecdotal pain relief, also lack any credible proposed mechanism and clinical research is not promising. The American Cancer Society states that \\"available scientific evidence does not support these claims\\". See archived online version Electromagnetic therapy is a related field. See chapter in ACS book just referenced, and archived ACS webpage on that. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, studies of magnetic jewelry haven't shown demonstrable effects on pain, nerve function, cell growth or blood flow. A 2008 systematic review of magnet therapy for all indications found insufficient evidence to determine whether magnet therapy is effective for pain relief, as did a 2012 review focused on osteoarthritis. Both reviews reported that small sample sizes, inadequate randomization, and difficulty with allocation concealment all tend to bias studies positively and limit the strength of any conclusions.  Safety  These devices are generally considered safe in themselves, though there can be significant financial and opportunity costs to magnet therapy, especially when treatment or diagnosis are avoided or delayed.  Reception  The worldwide magnet therapy industry totals sales of over a billion dollars per year, including $300 million per year in the United States alone. A 2002 U.S. National Science Foundation report on public attitudes and understanding of science noted that magnet therapy is \\"not at all scientific.\\" \\"Among all who had heard of [magnet therapy], 14 percent said it was very scientific and another 54 percent said it was sort of scientific. Only 25 percent of those surveyed answered correctly, that is, that it is not at all scientific.\\" A number of vendors make unsupported claims about magnet therapy by using pseudoscientific and new-age language. Such claims are unsupported by the results of scientific and clinical studies. = Legal regulations = Marketing of any therapy as effective treatment for any condition is heavily restricted by law in many jurisdictions unless all such claims are scientifically validated. In the United States, for example, U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations prohibit marketing any magnet therapy product using medical claims, as such claims are unfounded.

While living there, prior to his family emigrating to Canada when Byrne was 8, he was first exposed to comics, saying in 2005, His first encounter with Marvel Comics was in 1962 with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four #5.\\"Avengers Assemble: Question of the Month\\", Avengers #233 (July 1983) Marvel Comics He later commented that \\"the book had an 'edge' like nothing DC was putting out at the time\\". Jack Kirby's work in particular had a strong influence on Byrne and he has worked with many of the characters Kirby created or co-created. Besides Kirby, Byrne was influenced by the naturalistic style of Neal Adams. In 1970, Byrne enrolled at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary. He created the superhero parody Gay Guy for the college newspaper, which poked fun at the campus stereotype of homosexuality among art students. Gay Guy is notable for featuring a prototype of the Alpha Flight character Snowbird. While there, he published his first comic book, ACA Comix #1, featuring \\"The Death's Head Knight\\". Byrne left the college in 1973 without graduating. He broke into comics with a \\"Fan Art Gallery\\" piece in Marvel's promotional publication FOOM in early 1974 and by illustrating a two-page story by writer Al Hewetson in Skywald Publications' black-and-white horror magazine Nightmare #20 (Aug. 1974). He then began freelancing for Charlton Comics, making his color-comics debut with the E-Man backup feature \\"Rog-2000\\", starring a robot character he'd created in the mid-1970s that colleagues Roger Stern and Bob Layton named and began using for spot illustrations in their fanzine CPL (Contemporary Pictorial Literature). A Rog-2000 story written by Stern, with art by Byrne and Layton, had gotten the attention of Charlton Comics editor Nicola Cuti, who extended Byrne an invitation. Written by Cuti, \\"Rog-2000\\" became one of several alternating backup features in the Charlton Comics superhero series E-Man, starting with the eight-page \\"That Was No Lady\\" in issue #6 (Jan. 1975). While that was Byrne's first published color-comics work, \\"My first professional comic book sale was to Marvel, a short story called Dark Asylum' ... which languished in a flat file somewhere until it was used as filler in Giant-Size Dracula #5 [(June 1975)], long after the first Rog story.\\" (Archive requires scrolldown.) The story was plotted by Tony Isabella and written by David Anthony Kraft. After the Rog-2000 story, Byrne went on to work on the Charlton books Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch, Space: 1999, and Emergency!, and co-created with writer Joe Gill the post-apocalyptic science-fiction series Doomsday + 1. Byrne additionally drew a cover for the supernatural anthology The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves #54 (Dec. 1975). Marvel Comics Byrne said he broke into Marvel comics after writer Chris Claremont Byrne soon went on to draw series including The Champions (#12-15, 17 1977-78) and Marvel Team-Up (#53‚Äì55, 59‚Äì70, 75, 79, 100). Byrne first drew the X-Men in Marvel Team-Up #53. For many issues, he was paired with Claremont, with whom he teamed for issue #11 of the black-and-white Marvel magazine Marvel Preview featuring Star-Lord. The Star-Lord story was inked by Terry Austin, who soon afterward teamed with Claremont and Byrne on X-Men. =The Uncanny X-Men= The Uncanny X-Men #135 (July 1980). Cover art by Byrne & Terry Austin. Byrne joined Claremont beginning with The X-Men #108 (Dec. 1977). Their work together, along with inker Terry Austin, on such classic story arcs as \\"Proteus\\", \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\", and \\"Days of Future Past\\" would make them both fan favorites. Byrne insisted that the title keep its Canadian character, Wolverine, and contributed a series of story elements to justify Wolverine's presence which eventually made the character among the most popular in Marvel's publishing history. With issue #114, Byrne began co-plotting the series as well as penciling. Claremont recounted that \\"at that point in time John and I were, in a very real sense, true collaborators on the book. It was with very few exceptions, difficult, for me, anyway, to tell in the actual gestation of the book where one of us left off and the other began ‚Äì because it involved one of us coming up with an idea and bouncing it off the other ...\\"\\"The Dark Phoenix Tapes\\", Phoenix: The Untold Story #1 (April 1984). Note: The indicia lists the publication title as simply Phoenix, with no subtitle. The \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" in 1980 is one of the most notable stories in the title's history.DeFalco, Tom \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 196: \\"In January [1980] a nine-part story began that changed the X-Men forever...Claremont proposed a story that would show how Jean Grey ‚Äì one of the original members of the X-Men ‚Äì had become corrupted by her new Phoenix power. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that \\"'The Dark Phoenix Saga' is to Claremont and Byrne what the 'Galactus Trilogy' is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators' work at the height of their abilities.\\" Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan, and has said that they were \\"almost constantly at war over who the characters were.\\" Byrne created the characters Alpha Flight,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 189 Proteus,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 190 and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat during his run on The X-Men. A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the \\"Days of Future Past\\" storyline (#141‚Äì142, Jan.-Feb. 1981) in which a time-travelling Kitty Pryde tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 200 Byrne plotted the story wanting to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. Byrne left The X-Men with #143 (March 1981). During his tenure on the series, The X-Men was promoted from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule as sales steadily increased  a trend that continued long after Byrne left.Thomas and Sanderson, p. 137: \\"The Uncanny X-Men remained something of a cult book, with a small but devoted following, but as the 1980s continued, sales went up and up. By mid-decade, it was consistently the top-selling comic book not simply at Marvel but in the entire American comics industry.\\" In the late 1970s, while serving as the regular penciller of X-Men, Byrne began penciling another superhero team title, The Avengers. Working for the most part with writer David Michelinie, he drew issues #164‚Äì166 and 181‚Äì191. Byrne and Michelinie co-created Scott Lang in Avengers #181 (March 1979). Byrne's nine-issue run of Captain America, issues #247‚Äì255 (July 1980 ‚Äì March 1981), with writer Roger Stern, included issue #250, in which the character mulled running for the office of President of the United States.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 198: \\"The National Populist Party asked Captain America to run for President of the United States in this issue by writer Roger Stern and artist John Byrne.\\" =Fantastic Four= Fantastic Four #232 (July 1981), Byrne's debut as writer-artist. Cover art by Byrne and inker Terry Austin Byrne's post-X-Men body of work at Marvel includes his five-year run on Fantastic Four (#232‚Äì295, July 1981 ‚Äì October 1986), which is generally considered a \\"second golden age\\" for the title. Byrne said his goal was to \\"turn the clock back ... get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception\\".Quoted in DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 200: \\"John Byrne went back to basics with the Fantastic Four and evoked the title's early days of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.\\" He made a number of changes during his tenure: The Thing was temporarily replaced as a member of the quartet by the She-Hulk, while the Thing had adventures in his own comic (#1 ‚Äì 22 also written by Byrne), and the Thing's longtime girlfriend Alicia Masters left him for his teammate the Human Torch; the Invisible Girl was developed into the most powerful member with her heightened control of her refined powers and the self-confident assertiveness to use it epitomized by her name change to the Invisible Woman;DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 221: \\"After freeing herself from the Psycho-Man's control, Susan changed her name from the Invisible Girl to the Invisible Woman.\\" and headquarters the Baxter Building was destroyed and replaced with Four Freedoms Plaza. Byrne has cited multiple reasons for leaving the series, including \\"internal office politics\\" and that \\"it simply started to get old\\". =Alpha Flight= In 1983, while still at the helm of Fantastic Four, Byrne began to write and draw Alpha Flight, starring a Canadian superhero team that had been introduced \\"merely to survive a fight with the X-Men.\\" Though the series proved initially very popular, with its first issue selling 500,000 copies, Byrne has said the title \\"was never much fun\\" and that he considered the characters two-dimensional. One of Alpha Flight's characters, Northstar, eventually became Marvel's first openly gay superhero. Though Byrne from the beginning intended the character to be gay, (Archive requires scrolldown) Northstar's homosexuality was only hinted at during Byrne's tenure on the series. =Indiana Jones= In 1983 Byrne also co-wrote and penciled issues 1 and 2 of The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones, a two part story arc titled \\"The Ikons of Ikammanen\\". =Incredible Hulk= In 1985, after issue #28 of Alpha Flight, Byrne swapped series with Bill Mantlo, writer of The Incredible Hulk. According to Byrne, he discussed his ideas with editor-in-chief Jim Shooter ahead of time, but once Byrne was on the title, Shooter objected to them. Byrne wrote and drew issues #314‚Äì319. The final issue of Byrne's run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 227: \\"Dr. Bruce Banner first met Betty Ross in The Incredible Hulk #1 (May 1962) and finally married her in issue #319 by John Byrne.\\" DC Comics = The Untold Legend of the Batman = In early 1980, Byrne did his first work for DC Comics, penciling the first issue of The Untold Legend of the Batman miniseries. Byrne had always wanted to draw Batman, and had a three-month window of time during which he was not under contract to Marvel. Hearing about the Untold Legend series, Byrne contacted editor Paul Levitz to express interest. DC took him up on his offer, but it was not until the second month of his three-month window that Byrne received the plot for the first issue. Byrne told Levitz that he would not be able to finish the project due to time constraints despite DC then allegedly offering Byrne double his Marvel pay rate, after initially saying they could not match his Marvel rate. Byrne penciled the first issue, which was inked by Jim Aparo after being intended for Terry Austin. This experience soured Byrne on DC for quite some time. = Superman = Near the end of his time at Marvel, Byrne was hired by DC Comics to revamp its flagship character Superman.Manning, \\"1980s\\", in Dolan, p. 221. \\"In the six-issue miniseries entitled [The] Man of Steel, the mammoth task of remaking Superman fell to popular writer/artist John Byrne...The result was an overwhelming success, popular with fans both old and new.\\" This was part of a company-wide restructuring of the history of the DC Universe and all of its characters following the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. Byrne's reworking of Superman in particular gained widespread media coverage outside the comic book industry, including articles in Time and The New York Times. The Man of Steel #1 (Oct. 1986). Cover art by Byrne. At the time, Byrne said, \\"I'm taking Superman back to the basics ... It's basically Siegel and Shuster's Superman meets the Fleischer Superman in 1986.\\" Byrne significantly reduced Superman's powers (though he was still one of the most powerful beings on Earth), eliminated the Fortress of Solitude and super-dog Krypto, and kept Jonathan and Martha Kent alive into Clark's adulthood to enjoy their adopted son's triumphs, as well as to provide him with support, grounding, and advice whenever he needed it. Byrne also used Marv Wolfman's idea of making Lex Luthor a wealthy business owner in addition to a scientific genius with a deadly vendetta against the superhero. Byrne did away with the childhood/teenage career as Superboy; in his revamped history, Clark Kent does not put on a costume and become a super-hero until adulthood. This approach to Kent's path to becoming Superman was later used in the TV series Lois & Clark and Smallville, and in the 2005 novel It's Superman by Tom De Haven. In the Superman mythos, Byrne wrote Clark Kent as having a more aggressive and extroverted personality than previously depicted, even making him a top high- school football player. Byrne came up with explanations for how Superman's disguise works, such as the public simply does not realize that he has a secret identity since he is unmasked, that Superman would vibrate his face via his super speed in order to blur his image to photographers, and having Kent keep a weight training set around to explain how the human and presumably weaker Kent could have a frame as massive as Superman's. Byrne's Superman felt that his deepest roots were on Earth, and that his home planet of \\"Krypton is anathema to him\\". The origin and early career of Byrne's version of Superman debuted in the six-issue miniseries The Man of Steel (July‚ÄìSept. 1986), the first issue of which was marketed with two different covers illustrated by Byrne, the first use of variant covers by the American comics industry. Byrne penciled the six-issue DC Universe crossover miniseries Legends (Nov. 1986 ‚Äì May 1987) during this time.Manning, \\"1980s\\", in Dolan, p. 221. \\"DC's next big crossover showcased John Byrne's pencils on all six of the miniseries' issues. Entitled Legends, this new limited series was plotted by writer John Ostrander and scripted by Len Wein...By the series' end, the stage was set for several new ongoing titles, including...the Suicide Squad, as well as the Justice League.\\" He wrote and drew two monthly Superman titles with the hero's present-day adventures: a new Superman title beginning with issue #1 (January 1987)Manning, \\"1980s\\", in Dolan, p. 226. \\"For the second time in his history, Superman's self-titled comic saw a first issue...a new series was introduced...written and drawn by the prolific Byrne.\\" and Action Comics, in which, beginning with issue #584, Superman teamed up with other DC characters. The original Superman book was renamed The Adventures of Superman starting with issue #424 and was initially written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Jerry Ordway, but the writing chores were taken over by Byrne after a year from issues #436‚Äì442 and 444. As 1988 marked the 50th anniversary year of Superman's creation, Byrne did more Superman-related projects while working on the core Superman monthly titles at the same time: he wrote the prestige format graphic novel, Superman: The Earth Stealers and three separate four- issue miniseries: The World of Krypton, The World of Metropolis, and The World of Smallville. He supplied the cover art for the March 14, 1988 issue of Time magazine and an interior spread featuring Superman, where his pencils were inked by Ordway. After his initial run on the Superman titles from 1986‚Äì1988, Byrne would make a return as a guest inker on Adventures of Superman Annual #2 (cover) and Superman #50 in 1990. He would return doing a Superman Elseworlds story as writer & artist in Action Comics Annual #6 in 1994. In 2004 Superman: True Brit, an Elseworlds story, was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson, with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer. Byrne returned to draw Superman in Action Comics #827‚Äì835, working with writer Gail Simone, from 2005‚Äì2006. Byrne spent about two years on the Superman titles before leaving. His dissatisfaction stemmed from his perception that there was a lack of \\"conscious support\\" for him at DC. Furthering the rift between the company and the artist was the fact that the version of Superman which DC licensed for merchandising was contrary to Byrne's representation in the comic books. Return to Marvel =Star Brand= In 1986, Marvel began publication of a new line of superhero titles created by then-Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, which took place in a continuum removed from the Marvel Universe proper, called the New Universe. In 1987, the New Universe line saw a revamp under new Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco, and Byrne took over writing and art- breakdowns on the line's flagship title, Star Brand (renamed The Star Brand during Byrne's term on the book). Byrne's run started with issue #11 and continued until the series' cancellation eight issues later upon Marvel's discontinuation of the New Universe line. =Avengers West Coast= In 1989, after leaving Superman, Byrne returned to work on a number of titles for Marvel Comics. His work on West Coast AvengersDeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 240: \\"Writer/artist John Byrne produced the story arc that came to be known as 'Vision Quest' that ran through The West Coast Avengers #42‚Äì45.\\" (issues #42‚Äì57, soon renamed Avengers West Coast) was contingent on his being allowed to do what he called \\"my Vision story\\". The Vision was a long-standing Marvel superhero and member of The Avengers, an android originally created by the villain Ultron constructed with the body of the original Human Torch. The Vision went on to join the team, marry his teammate the Scarlet Witch, and father two children by her. Byrne radically changed this, revealing that Ultron lied about the Vision's creation. The android Human Torch was found and joined the WCA. The Vision was disassembled and stripped of his emotions. The couple's twins were revealed to be pieces of the soul of the demon Mephisto. In addition to these changes, Byrne's run is remembered for the introduction of the Great Lakes Avengers, an eclectic group of new superheroes.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 241: \\"Writer/artist John Byrne took a tongue-in- cheek approach to superheroics.\\" =The Sensational She-Hulk= During She- Hulk's tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in Marvel Graphic Novel #18 (Nov. 1985) in a story titled The Sensational She-Hulk, which Byrne wrote and illustrated.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 241 On the request of editor Mark Gruenwald, Byrne wrote and drew a new series in 1989, The Sensational She-Hulk (maintaining the 1985 graphic novel's title). Gruenwald directed that it be significantly different from the character's previous series, The Savage She-Hulk. Byrne's take was comedic and the She-Hulk, who was aware she was in a comic book, regularly broke the fourth wall, developing a love-hate relationship with her artist/writer by criticizing his storylines, drawing style, character development, etc. Byrne left the book after writing and drawing the first eight issues. Byrne was asked for input on writer Dwayne McDuffie's She-Hulk: Ceremony limited series, and according to Byrne, most of his objections to the story and notations of errors were ignored, and his editor, Bobbie Chase, \\"was rewriting my stuff to bring it into line with\\" the story in Ceremony. Upon complaining to DeFalco, Byrne says he was fired from his series. He later returned to write and draw issues #31‚Äì50 under new editor Ren√©e Witterstaetter. =Namor, the Sub-Mariner= Byrne started a new series, Namor, the Sub-Mariner in April 1990.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 248: \\"Comics superstar John Byrne revamped the classic Marvel character Namor in this new series that he both wrote and drew.\\" Byrne's take on the undersea antihero Namor cast him as the head of a surface company, Oracle, Inc., in order to help keep the ocean unpolluted, and had Namor involved in corporate intrigue. After writing and drawing the book for 25 issues, Byrne told editor Terry Kavanagh that he was starting to feel constrained on the book and thought having a different artist might inspire him to a fresh approach. Kavanagh suggested newcomer Jae Lee, and Byrne continued as strictly writer of the book up through issue #32. Byrne later said he has great fondness for the title character and was unhappy that circumstances forced him to leave the series. =Iron Man= Byrne took over writing Iron Man for issues #258‚Äì277 (July 1990-Feb. 1992), drawn by John Romita Jr. and later by Paul Ryan. Byrne launched a second \\"Armor Wars\\" story arc, restored the Mandarin as a major Iron Man nemesis, and featured the 1950s \\"pre-superhero Marvel\\" monster Fin Fang Foom. During the course of his run, Byrne became the first writer to retcon Iron Man's origin, removing explicit ties to the Vietnam War (while maintaining a Southeast Asia setting), and linking Wong-Chu, the man who captured Tony Stark, to the Mandarin. Creator- owned works In the early 1990s, Byrne began creating a series of original, creator-owned works for publisher Dark Horse Comics. This was during a general trend in the industry for established creators working for Marvel and DC to bring their original works to other publishers or create their own companies to publish the works themselves (one prominent example is Image Comics). A number of these creators, including Byrne, Frank Miller, Mike Mignola, and Art Adams, banded together to form the Legend imprint at Dark Horse. Byrne's first title for Dark Horse was Next Men, a work he considered darker and more realistic than his previous work. The Next Men were five young people who were the product of a secret government experiment. Byrne said, \\"I thought I would see what I could do with superheroes in the 'real world' \\" and \\"[e]xplore the impact their existence would have.\\" Byrne's other Dark Horse titles were Babe, and Danger Unlimited, an all-age readers book about a team of heroes in the future fighting an alien occupation of Earth. The Next Men lasted until issue 30 in 1994, when Byrne ended the series, intending to return \\"in no more than six months.\\" Byrne says he \\"did not count on...the virtual collapse of the whole comic book industry, which seemed to occur at just the time I put Next Men on the shelf...In the present, very depressed marketplace, I don't feel Next Men would have much chance, so I leave the book hibernating until such time as the market improves.\\" IDW Publishing revived John Byrne's Next Men in 2010 following a series of trade paperbacks that collected the first series. The original storyline that had a cliffhanger ending in 1995 was continued. Later career In later years, Byrne has worked on titles for Marvel, DC, and other publishers, including the 1992 prestige format graphic novel Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale with science fiction author Larry Niven at DC. In 1989, Byrne wrote Batman #433‚Äì435 (May‚ÄìJuly 1989) and in the following year produced a 3-D graphic novel with 3-D effects by Ray Zone.Manning, \\"1990s\\", in Dolan, p. 247. \\"The Caped Crusader leaped off the pages in all his red-and- blue glory in this over-sized eighty-page special crafted by 3-D expert Ray Zone...[for] an all-new tale written and illustrated by John Byrne.\\" He returned to the X-Men franchise at Marvel from 1991 to 1992, succeeding longtime writer Chris Claremont, who left after 17 years working on the various X-Men related titles. Byrne's return as the new writer was brief, as he only scripted Uncanny X-Men issues #281‚Äì285 and 288 with artist Whilce Portacio, and X-Men issues #4‚Äì5 with artist Jim Lee. In 1995, Byrne wrote and drew the Marvel/DC intercompany crossover Darkseid vs. Galactus: The Hunger, which also featured the Jack Kirby creations the Silver Surfer and the New Gods. He wrote and drew another of DC's signature series, the long-running Wonder Woman, from 1995 to 1998. During that time, he elevated the super- heroine to the status of goddessManning, \\"1990s\\", in Dolan, p. 280. \\"It seemed Wonder Woman had breathed her last in Wonder Woman #124, thanks to writer and artist John Byrne.\\" who then ascended to Mount Olympus as the Goddess of Truth. Byrne then spotlighted supporting characters such as Queen Hippolyta in their own adventures but restored the series' status quo in his last issue.Manning, \\"1990s\\", in Dolan, p. 284. \\"Writer/artist John Byrne was leaving Wonder Woman...But before he could move on to other projects, there was one final thing Byrne still had to do: bring Wonder Woman back from the dead.\\" He additionally took over New Gods vol. 4 at the end of 1996, as writer-artist of issues #12‚Äì15, continuing with it as the series was rebooted with a new #1 as Jack Kirby's Fourth World. That ran 20 issues from 1997 to 1998. During his tenure on the New Gods, Byrne was writer of the four-issue miniseries crossover Genesis, a story line published weekly by DC Comics in August 1997. The series was drawn by Ron Wagner and Joe Rubinstein. Byrne wrote a Wonder Woman prose novel, Wonder Woman: Gods and Goddesses (1997, Prima Lifestyles, ). In the series Spider-Man: Chapter One, Byrne retold some of Spider-Man's earliest adventures, changing some key aspects. In late 1998, Byrne became writer of the flagship series, The Amazing Spider-Man, at the end of the series with issue #440, by which time Marvel had decided to relaunch the book. The \\"last\\" issue of The Amazing Spider-Man was #441 (November 1998), with Marvel re-initiating the series with a new issue #1 (Jan. 1999) with Howard Mackie as writer and Byrne on pencils.Cowsill \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 246: \\"This new series heralded a fresh start for the web-slinger's adventures.\\" Byrne penciled issues #1‚Äì18 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13‚Äì14. In 1999, Byrne, working with artist Ron Garney, wrote the first seven issues of a new Hulk series,Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 294: \\"Bruce Banner took to the road in an attempt to escape his past in this new series by writer John Byrne and artist Ron Garney.\\" as well as the summer annual. From 1999 to 2001, Byrne returned to the X-Men to write and draw X-Men: The Hidden YearsManning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 295: \\"[The gap between The X-Men #66 in 1970 and Giant-Size X-Men #1 in 1975] left fans to wonder what the originals were up to in all that time, a question that writer/artist John Byrne decided to answer in this new ongoing series.\\" which ran for 22 issues. Byrne explained the title's cancellation by saying, \\"I was officially informed yesterday that, despite the fact that they are still profitable, several 'redundant' X-Titles are being axed.\\" This disagreement factored in his decision to no longer work for Marvel Comics. Like X-Men: The Hidden Years, some other works of this period involved characters and events in time periods other than the present and, in some cases, considered \\"skipped over\\" (Marvel: The Lost Generation), or alternate timelines (DC's Superman & Batman: Generations);Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dougall, p. 239: \\"Writer/artist John Byrne returned to the Man of Steel and paired him with the Caped Crusader in this four-issue prestige format Elseworlds series.\\" a feature some of these have in common is to have characters who actually age during the course of the series, which is uncommon for characters in ongoing comics. In early 2003, Byrne spent ten weeks as guest penciler on the syndicated newspaper strip Funky Winkerbean. Byrne did this as a favor for Winkerbean's creator, Tom Batiuk, who was recovering from foot surgery.Batiuk, Tom, statement in Most of his work in the first decade of the new millennium was for DC Comics: JLA (issues #94‚Äì99 in 2004, co-writing and illustrating the \\"Tenth Circle\\" story arc, reuniting with his Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont and with Jerry Ordway as inker), Doom Patrol, Blood of the Demon, a five-issue arc of JLA Classified. He penciled an issue of Hawkman (vol. 4) #26 in May 2004. Superman: True Brit was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson, with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer.Cowsill, Alan, \\"2000s\\", in Dolan, p. 315. \\"Comedy legend John Cleese joined forces with artist John Byrne, inker Mark Farmer and writer Kim Johnson for a unique take on the Superman story. Superman: True Brit saw Kal-El's rocketship land on a farm...in the UK.\\" Byrne returned to draw Superman in Action Comics #827‚Äì835, working with writer Gail Simone, from 2005‚Äì2006. Afterward, Simone and Byrne reteamed to launch The All-New Atom series in 2006, with Byrne pencilling the first three issues. For publisher IDW, Byrne worked on the superhero series FX #1‚Äì6, written by Wayne Osborne, starting with the March 2008 issue. His other projects for the publisher include stories in the Star Trek universe and the Angel (TV series character) universe. Byrne's Star Trek work included the final issue of the miniseries Star Trek: Alien Spotlight (February 2008); the self-described \\"professional fan fiction\\", Star Trek: Assignment: Earth #1‚Äì5; Star Trek: Romulans #1‚Äì2, Star Trek: Crew (a Christopher Pike-era comic book focusing on the character of \\"Number One\\") started in March 2009; the final chapter of his Romulans story, a four-issue miniseries, Star Trek: Leonard McCoy, Frontier Doctor, set before Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and the second Assignment: Earth series. His work on Angel included Angel: Blood and Trenches (set during World War I); an Angel vs Frankenstein one-shot; and an Andy Hallett tribute, Angel: Music of the Spheres and Angel vs Frankenstein II in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. In 2011, he worked on Jurassic Park: The Devils in the Desert, and Cold War (The Michael Swann Dossier). He revived his Next Men series in 2010‚Äì2011, with the sequel series Aftermath.

Controversies Over the years, Byrne has gained a reputation as a controversial figure, and has himself noted that \\"as the people who have figured me out have said, I just don't suffer fools gladly.\\" In 1981, Jack Kirby began speaking publicly about his belief that he'd been deprived of fair credit and money while creating the majority of Marvel's top characters. Byrne wrote an editorial declaring himself \\"proud\\" to be a \\"company man,\\" and arguing that all creators should \\"live within the rules while they're around.\\" Steve Gerber and Kirby lampooned Byrne's position in Destroyer Duck, drawing him as a character called Booster Cogburn, possessing a removable spine and existing only to serve as a cog in the mammoth corporation that owned him.Destroyer Duck, Eclipse Comics, 1981‚Äì83, issues #1‚Äì5; the letters page of #5 discusses the physical likeness and similarity of names, and acknowledges that the character is a response to comments Byrne made in the fan press. Erik Larsen created a villain in the 1990s for his Savage Dragon and the Freak Force series' Johnny Redbeard/the Creator, who parodies Byrne; a massive cranium with atrophied appendages, he can bestow superpowers indiscriminately.Evans, Eric. \\"What Kirby Wanted\\", foreword to Savage Dragon Companion #1 (Image Comics, July 2002), p. 5. In 1982, during a panel discussion at the Dallas Fantasy Fair, Byrne made disparaging comments about longtime comics writer and one-time Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas that were published in The Comics Journal #75 (Sept. 1982), Thomas threatened a slander suit if Byrne did not apologize. In a letter printed in The Comics Journal #82 (July 1983), Byrne retracted his statements, claiming he was only repeating information from others, writing, \\"I acted only in the office of a parrot.\\" Gail Simone, who worked with Byrne on The All New Atom in 2006, described Byrne as \\"very opinionated; a lot of artists are opinionated, and I'm okay with that. Actually, I think John Byrne is brilliant and his forceful personality is part of that.\\" (Archive requires scrolldown.) Art style Byrne has himself called his style a \\"collection of influences\\". He cites Neal Adams, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko as primary influences on his style, but continues to pick up on ideas that he sees and likes while constantly changing his tools and methods.Modern Masters: John Byrne. Volume seven By Eric Nolen-Weathington, Jon B. Cooke, John Byrne Byrne is color blind for a narrow range of green and brown tones. During the first year that Byrne illustrated Iron Fist, he believed that the protagonist's costume was brown. While he experimented with his own hand-developed lettering fonts in the early 1980s, he has since begun using a computer font based on the handwriting of the letterer Jack Morelli. Personal life Byrne became a naturalized American citizen in 1988. He was married to photographer and actress Andrea Braun Byrne for 15 years until divorcing. Braun's son from a previous marriage is Kieron Dwyer, and Byrne became Dwyer's stepfather when the boy was 13 until Byrne divorced his mother. They only lived together for a short time as the young Dwyer soon moved to Los Angeles to live with his father. Byrne encouraged Dwyer's aspirations to be a cartoonist and assisted in landing Dwyer's first professional job drawing Batman #413 (Nov. 1987). Since 2015, Byrne no longer attends any conventions regularly and makes rare public appearances. He made an exceptional appearance at the 2018 Fan Expo Boston, where he spoke at two events, both titled \\"Spotlight on John Byrne\\" on August 11 and 12, and an autograph signing with William Shatner. Awards Byrne received the Favourite Comic Book Artist Eagle Awards in 1978 and 1979, and a 1980 Inkpot Award. In 2008, Byrne was inducted into the Canadian Comic Book Creator Hall of Fame. In 2015, Byrne was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame, alongside judges' choices Marge (Marjorie Henderson Buell) and Bill Woggon and elected inductees Chris Claremont, Denis Kitchen, and Frank Miller.

Mythology The Insane Athamas Killing Learchus, While Ino and Melicertor Jump into the Sea'' by Wilhelm Janson (Holland, Amsterdam), Antonio Tempesta (Italy, Florence, 1555-1630) at Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles Ino, pursued by her husband, who had been driven mad by Hera because Ino had brought up the infant Dionysus, threw herself and Melicertes into the sea from a high rock between Megara and Corinth, Both were changed into marine deities: Ino as Leucothea, noted by Homer,Homer, Odyssey, 5.333 Melicertes as Palaemon. The body of the latter was carried by a dolphin to the Isthmus of Corinth and deposited under a pine tree. Here it was found by his uncle Sisyphus, who had it removed to Corinth, and by command of the Nereids instituted the Isthmian Games and sacrifices in his honor. In literature and art Palaemon appears for the first time in Euripides' Iphigeneia in Tauris, where he is already the \\"guardian of ships\\".Euripides, Iphigeneia in Tauris, 270. The paramount identification in the Latin poets of the Augustan age is with Portunus, the Roman god of safe harbours, memorably in Virgil's Georgics.Virgil, Georgics 1.436-7: sailors, preserved from the hazards of the sea and safely ashore, give thanks to Melicertes. Ovid twice told the story of Ino's sea-plunge with Melicertes in her arms.Ovid, Fasti 6.473ff, and Metamorphoses 4.416ff. Ovid's treatment in his Fasti is the earliest to identify the Isthmus as the location, though without literally naming it: In later Latin poets there are numerous identifications of Palaemon with the sanctuary at the Isthmus, where no archaeological evidence was found for a pre-Augustan cult. Hyginus states both that Ino cast herself into the sea with her younger son by Athamas, Melicertes, and was made a goddess, and that Ino, daughter of Cadmus, killed her son Melicertes by Athamas, son of Aeolus, when she was fleeing from Athamas. In Greco-Roman views, Palaemon is viewed as a dolphin riding boy, or a child with a triton tail. Origins No satisfactory origin of the name Palaemon has been given. The name means the \\"wrestler\\",Fowler, p. 316; Fontenrose, p. 352. and is an epithet of Heracles, with whom Melqart is identified by interpretatio graeca and referred to as the Tyrian Herakles, but there does not appear to be any traditional connection between Heracles and Palaemon. Melicertes being Phoenician, Palaemon also has been explained as the \\"burning lord\\" (Baal-haman), but there seems little in common between a god of the sea and a god of fire. The Romans identified Palaemon with Portunus (the harbour god), and some took the name Palaemon to mean \\"the honey eater\\". Cult In the late 2nd century CE, within the sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia, Pausanias saw a temple of Palaemon: In company with Leucothea, Melicertes/Palaemon was widely invoked for protection from dangers at sea.The Greek Anthology contains several prayers of this type (Loeb Classical Library, vol. I, book 6, nos. 164, 223, 348); Aelius Aristides (Isthm. in Pos. 49); Nonnus, Dionysiaca 47.354; Orphic Hymns, 74, 75, are all noted by Hawthorne 1958:92, note 3. There seems considerable doubt whether or not the cult of Melicertes was of foreign, probably Phoenician, origin, and introduced by Phoenician navigators on the coasts and islands of the Aegean and Mediterranean.Edouard Will, summarizing the debate in 1955, concluded in Korinthiaka (1955:169 note 3) that Melicertes was wholly Greek. For the Hellenes he is a native of Boeotia, where Phoenician influences were strong; at Tenedos he was propitiated by the sacrifice of children which seems to point to his identity with Melqart. The premature death of the child in the Greek form of the legend is probably an allusion to this. In 1956 excavations at Isthmia by the University of Chicago under the direction of Oscar Broneer uncovered the small sanctuary of Palaemon, which eventually had a tiny Roman round temple in the Corinthian order, which appeared on coins of Corinth in the 2nd century CE; it was the successor to two previous more modest architectural phases of the sanctuary. The foundations of the temple were found to lie over the starting-line of a late-5th- or early-4th-century BCE stadium. Worship was characterized by the dedication of hundreds of wheelmade oil lamps of a distinct type.The completed excavation was published by Broneer in Hesperia 27 (1958:1‚Äì57). A cult of Melicertes of great antiquity, possibly based on pre-Hellenic figures of Ino and Melicertes, was posited by Edouard Will just previous to the site's discoveryWill, in Korinthiaka (1955:168-80, 210‚Äì12. and refuted by John Hawthorne in 1958.Hawthorne, \\"The Myth of Palaemon\\", Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 89 (1958:92‚Äì98). The archaeologists found evidence of bull sacrifice and a tub which may have been filled with water in an initiation rite for members. This further cements the connection of Melicertes with the Corinthian Games, one of the four major athletic festivals in Greece, the most famous of which is the Olympian Games.

It was valid for the entire duchy of Brabant. From this charter originated a kind of \\"Parliament of Kortenberg\\" or a \\"Council of Kortenberg\\" or what was called an assembly of \\"The Lords of Kortenberg\\". With this Charter the Duchy of Brabant was the first state in the Low Countries or perhaps even the first state of Europe to give the estates the right for participation. Actually one of the first democratic decisions in feudal Europe. The control organ, a precursor of the later \\"Estate assembly\\" (namely, the first estate was the clergy, the second estate was the nobility, and the third estate was the municipalities) gathered in the Kortenberg Abbey and elsewhere with ups and downs until 1375. From 1332 on the council was extended by two more members, so that there were 16 Lords; Antwerp got a second member and the Walloon Brabant town of Nivelles () also got a member. In 1340 documents were sealed with a special seal on which a tree was planted on a little hill (the \\"short\\" or \\"sharp\\"?). The seal bore the words \\"SIGILUM COMMUNE : CONSILII DE CORTENBERGHE\\" (the common or usual seal of the Council of Kortenberg). Magna Carta and the Charter of Kortenberg Although Magna Carta is commonly regarded as the very first charter giving rise to medieval European constitutionalism, the Charter of Kortenberg appears to have been far more democratic in nature. This mainly because the beneficiaries of Magna Carta were only the barons while the beneficiaries of the Charter of Kortenberg included all citizens, expressly 'the rich and the poor' (riken ende armen). Reinforcing this view is the composition of the Council of Kortenberg which clearly marks a difference with the more 'elitist' Magna Carta. Whilst Magna Carta was to be implemented by a council of 25 barons, the Council of Kortenberg counted four knights and ten townsmen. In the financial commission of August 1314 the nobility were only two against the representatives of eight towns. Because of the historical continuity from the Charter of Kortenberg to the Joyous Entries of many monarchs or their governors into Flemish and Brabantian towns, the migration of millions of educated citizens in the 16th & 17th century from these towns to the Seven United Provinces as a result of the Eighty Years' War and the stay of the Pilgrim Fathers into those Provinces (in the Dutch city of Leiden) prior to their departure for America, coupled with the enduring influence of New Netherlander society upon the early American political life, the emphasis placed by American historians and the general public opinion upon the constitutive nature of Magna Carta for the American constitution and the American Dream seems too narrow if no mention is made from the Charter of Kortenberg or other Brabantian charters. Modern version of the charter of Kortenberg We, duke John II of Brabant, agree # That no other demands or taxes be levied than those which are known as the three feudal cases: #* at the knighthood of my son #* the wedding of my daughter #* and if I should be taken captive #:The taxes will be reasonable (fiscal prerogative). # An honourable jurisdiction for rich and poor. (judicial prerogative). # To recognise the freedom of our good towns. (municipal prerogative). # To establish a council which shall be comprised (sic) of: #* 4 knights or nobles. #* 10 representatives from the 5 cities as follows: # 3 from Leuven # 3 from Brussels # 1 from Antwerp # 1 from 's-Hertogenbosch (nowadays in North Brabant, Netherlands) # 1 from Tienen # 1 from Zoutleeuw # This council be allowed to meet at Kortenberg in the Abbey. It will meet every 3 weeks to monitor whether the financial, judicial and municipal prerogatives are observed. # That in the future improvements are introduced to the administration of the land by the council. # That upon the death of members of the Council of Kortenberg, new members be designated. # That the members of the Council take an oath on the Holy Gospel that they will pursue the best interests of the public. # That the people have the right to resist should the Duke or his descendants refuse to observe the Charter of Kortenberg.

In the 17th century, it became the hostelry of choice of \\"Hanging\\" Judge Jeffreys, scourge of the Monmouth Rebellion. He lived nearby and a replica gallows and noose hangs by the Thameside window, commemorating his custom. He was chased by anti-Royalists into the nearby Town of Ramsgate, captured and taken to the Tower for his own safety. According to John Stow it was \\"The usual place for hanging of pirates and sea-rovers, at the low-water mark, and there to remain till three tides had overflowed them\\". Execution Dock was actually by Wapping Old Stairs and generally used for pirates.The Thames Tunnel, Ratcliff Highway and Wapping, Old and New London: Volume 2 (1878), pp. 128‚Äì37 Retrieved 29 March 2007 In the eighteenth century, the first fuchsia plant in the United Kingdom was sold at the pub. Views from the pub were sketched by both Turner and Whistler. The writers Charles Dickens and Samuel Pepys are known to have paused to sup here. Following a fire in the early 19th century, the tavern was rebuilt and renamed The Prospect of Whitby, after a Tyne collier that used to berth next to the pub. The ship took sea coal from Newcastle upon Tyne to London. The Prospect was listed as a Grade II listed building in December 1950. The pub underwent a renovation in 1951 to double the interior space. In January 1953, the pub was raided by armed robbers. The pub has been visited by Princess Margaret and Prince Rainier III of Monaco. On the opposite side of the road (Wapping Wall) is the Wapping Hydraulic Power Station, later an arts centre and restaurant. In popular culture The public house features briefly in an episode of Only Fools And Horses. When Uncle Albert goes missing in one episode, Del Boy and Rodney travel around London looking for him. Nicholas Lyndhurst is shown in one scene walking out of the pub. There is also a scene from the 1956 film D-Day the Sixth of June starring Robert Taylor and Richard Todd where Taylor's character is seen with Dana Wynter's character having drinks together during the Second World War in London. In the comic book The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Mina Harker pauses in front of the public house and says it brings back memories. She is referring to the beaching of the Demeter at Whitby in the novel Dracula. This pub is also featured in Vercors's novel Les Animaux d√©natur√©s (translated variously into English as You Shall Know Them, Borderline, and The Murder of the Missing Link). The pub also appears in Whitechapel, Series 4, Episode 4, where the body of a victim is discovered on the Thames shoreline. DS Miles briefly explains its history to DI Chandler. The pub features in The Old Guard (2020), including extensive shots of the pub interior and footage on the Thames shore below. A photograph of the Malcolm Price Trio was taken inside the pub and featured on the front cover of their second LP, titled \\"Way Down Town\\", in 1965.

During the 13th century, John I was venerated as a folk hero. He has been painted as the perfect model of a brave, adventurous and chivalrous feudal prince. Life John I's effigy on a silver coin. Struck in Brussels or Leuven during his reign. Born in Leuven, he was the son of Henry III, Duke of Brabant and Aleidis of Burgundy, daughter of Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy. He was also an older brother of Maria of Brabant, Queen consort of Philip III of France. In 1267 his older brother Henry IV, Duke of Brabant, being mentally deficient, was deposed in his favour. John's greatest military victory was the Battle of Worringen 1288, by which John I came to reign over the Duchy of Limburg. He was completely outnumbered in forces but led the successful invasion into the Rhineland to defeat the confederacy. In 1288 Limburg was formally attached to Brabant. John I was said to be a model of feudal prince: brave, adventurous; excelling in every form of active exercise, fond of display, and generous in temper. He was considered one of the most gifted princes of his time. This made him very popular in Middle Ages poetry and literature. Even today there exists an ode to him, so well known that it was a potential candidate to be the North Brabant anthem. John I delighted in tournaments and was always eager to take part in jousts. He was also famous for his many illegitimate children. On 3 May 1294 at some marriage festivities at Bar-le-Duc, John I was mortally wounded in the arm in an encounter by Pierre de Bausner. He was buried in the church of the Order of Friars Minor (Minderbroederskerk) in Brussels, but since the Protestant iconoclasm (Beeldenstorm) in 1566, nothing remains of his tomb.

It is located in the western suburbs of Paris, from the centre of Paris. Inhabitants are called Saint-Germanois or Saint-Germinois. With its elegant tree-lined streets it is one of the more affluent suburbs of Paris, combining both high-end leisure spots and exclusive residential neighborhoods (see the Golden Triangle of the Yvelines). Saint- Germain-en-Laye is a sub-prefecture of the department. Because it includes the National Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, it covers approximately , making it the largest commune in the Yvelines. It occupies a large loop of the Seine. Saint-Germain-en-Laye lies at one of the western termini of Line A of the RER. History Saint-Germain-en-Laye was founded in 1020 when King Robert the Pious (ruled 996‚Äì1031) founded a convent on the site of the present Church of Saint-Germain. In 1688, James II, King of England and VII of Scotland, exiled himself to the city after being deposed from the throne in what has become known as the Glorious Revolution. He spent the remainder of his days there, and died on 16 September 1701. The Church of Saint-Germain Prior to the French Revolution in 1789, it had been a royal town and the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain the residence of numerous French monarchs. The old ch√¢teau was constructed in 1348 by King Charles V on the foundations of an old castle (ch√¢teau-fort) dating from 1238 in the time of Saint Louis. Francis I was responsible for its subsequent restoration. In 1862, Napoleon III set up the Mus√©e des Antiquit√©s Nationales in the erstwhile royal ch√¢teau. This museum has exhibits ranging from Paleolithic to Celtic times. The \\"Dame de Brassempouy\\" sculpted on a mammoth's ivory tusk around 23,000 years ago is the most famous exhibit in the museum. Kings Henry IV and Louis XIII left their mark on the town. Louis XIV was born in the ch√¢teau (the city's coat of arms consequently shows a cradle and the date of his birth), and established Saint-Germain-en-Laye as his principal residence from 1661 to 1681. Louis XIV turned over the ch√¢teau to James VII & II of Scotland and England after his exile from Britain after the Glorious Revolution in 1688. James lived in the Ch√¢teau for 13 years, and his daughter Louisa Maria Stuart was born in exile here in 1692. James II is buried in the Church of Saint-Germain. Saint-Germain-en-Laye is famous for its long stone terrace built by Andr√© Le N√¥tre from 1669 to 1673. The terrace provides a view over the valley of the Seine and, in the distance, Paris. During the French Revolution, the name was changed along with many other places whose names held connotations of religion or royalty. Temporarily, Saint-Germain-en-Laye became Montagne-du-Bon-Air. During his reign, Napoleon I established his cavalry officers training school in the Ch√¢teau-Vieux. One of the German bunkers built in 1942 The Treaty of Saint-Germain was signed in 1919 and was applied on 16 July 1920. The treaty officially registered the breakup of the Habsburg empire, which recognized the independence of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (Yugoslavia).Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\"Treaty of Saint-Germain\\", retrieved from Britannica.com.

He adopted a military career at the outset of the American Revolutionary War, where his military exploits and fiery personality quickly earned him promotion to brigadier general and the nickname \\"Mad Anthony\\". He later served as the Senior Officer of the Army on the Ohio Country frontier and led the Legion of the United States. Wayne was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania, and worked as a tanner and surveyor after attending the College of Philadelphia. He was elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly and helped raise a Pennsylvania militia unit in 1775. During the Revolutionary War, he served in the Invasion of Quebec, the Philadelphia campaign, and the Yorktown campaign. His reputation suffered due to his defeat in the Battle of Paoli, but he won wide praise for his leadership in the 1779 Battle of Stony Point. He was promoted to Major General in 1783 but retired from the Continental Army soon after. After the war, Wayne settled in Georgia on land that had been granted to him for his military service. He briefly represented Georgia in the House of Representatives, then returned to the Army to accept command of U.S. forces in the Northwest Indian War. His forces defeated the Western Confederacy, an alliance of several Indian tribes, at the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers, and he masterminded the Treaty of Greenville which ended the war. Wayne died in 1796 in Erie, Pennsylvania, while on active duty. Early life Wayne was one of four children born to Isaac Wayne, who had immigrated to Easttown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, from Ireland, and Elizabeth Iddings Wayne. He was part of a Protestant Anglo-Irish family; his grandfather was a veteran of the Battle of the Boyne. Wayne was born on January 1, 1745, on his family's Waynesborough estate.Nelson, 5‚Äì6 He was educated as a surveyor at his uncle's private academy in Philadelphia as well as at the College of Philadelphia, although he did not earn a degree. In 1765, Benjamin Franklin sent him and some associates to work for a year surveying land granted in Nova Scotia, and he assisted with starting a settlement the following year at The Township of Monckton.Labaree, 345-50 In 1767, he returned to work in his father's tannery while continuing work as a surveyor. He became a prominent figure in Chester County and served in the Pennsylvania legislature from 1774 to 1780. He married Mary Penrose in 1766 and they had two children. Their daughter Margretta was born in 1770 and their son Isaac Wayne was born in 1772 and later became a Representative from Pennsylvania.Anthony and Mary (Penrose) Wayne Family Bible American Revolution A statue of General Wayne stands in Fort Wayne's Freimann Square Wayne raised a militia unit in 1775 and became colonel of the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment in 1776. He and his regiment were part of the Continental Army's unsuccessful invasion of Canada where he was sent to aid Benedict Arnold. Wayne commanded a successful rear-guard action at the Battle of Trois-Rivi√®res and then led the distressed forces on Lake Champlain at Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. His service led to his promotion to brigadier general on February 21, 1777. On September 11, 1777, Wayne commanded the Pennsylvania Line at the Battle of Brandywine where they held off General Wilhelm von Knyphausen in order to protect the American right flank. The two forces fought for three hours until the American line withdrew and Wayne was ordered to retreat.Nelson, 52 He was then ordered to harass the British rear in order to slow General Howe's advance towards Pennsylvania. Wayne's camp was attacked on the night of September 20‚Äì21 in the Battle of Paoli. General Charles Grey had ordered his men to remove their flints and attack with bayonets in order to keep their assault secret.Nelson, 55‚Äì58 The battle earned Grey the sobriquet of \\"General Flint\\", but Wayne's own reputation was tarnished by the significant American losses, and he demanded a formal inquiry in order to clear his name. On October 4, 1777, Wayne again led his forces against the British in the Battle of Germantown. His soldiers pushed ahead of other units, and the British \\"pushed on with their Bayonets‚Äîand took Ample Vengeance\\" as they retreated, according to Wayne's report.Nelson, 60 Generals Wayne and Sullivan advanced too quickly, however, and became entrapped when they were ahead of other American units. They retreated as General Howe arrived to re-form the British line. General Wayne was again ordered to hold off the British and cover the rear of the retreating body. After winter quarters at Valley Forge, Wayne led the attack at the 1778 Battle of Monmouth, where his forces were abandoned by General Charles Lee and were pinned down by a numerically superior British force. Wayne held out until relieved by reinforcements sent by Washington. He then re-formed his troops and continued to fight.Lancaster, 195‚Äì97 The body of Lt. Colonel Henry Monckton was discovered by the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment, and a legend grew that he had died fighting Wayne. In July 1779, Washington named Wayne to command the Corps of Light Infantry, a temporary unit of four regiments of light infantry companies drawn from all the regiments in the Main Army. His successful attack on British positions in the Battle of Stony Point was the highlight of his Revolutionary War service. On July 16, 1779, he replicated the bold attack used against him at Paoli and personally led a nighttime bayonet attack lasting 30 minutes. His three columns of about 1,500 light infantry stormed and captured British fortifications at Stony Point, a cliff- side redoubt commanding the southern Hudson River. The battle ended with around 550 prisoners taken, with fewer than 100 casualties for Wayne's forces. The success of this operation provided a boost to the morale of the army, which had suffered a series of military defeats, and the Continental Congress awarded him a medal for the victory. It was after this battle that he earned the name Mad Anthony for what his fellow soldiers saw as tactical bravery and courage. On July 21, 1780, Washington sent Wayne with two Pennsylvania brigades and four cannons to destroy a blockhouse at Bulls Ferry opposite New York City in the Battle of Bull's Ferry. Wayne's troops were unable to capture the position, suffering 64 casualties while inflicting 21 on the Loyalist defenders.Boatner, 119‚Äì20 A letter from Anthony Wayne to Israel Shreve, 1780. On January 1, 1781, Wayne served as commanding officer of the Pennsylvania Line of the Continental Army when pay and condition concerns led to the Pennsylvania Line Mutiny, one of the most serious of the war. He successfully resolved the mutiny by dismissing about half the line. He returned the Pennsylvania Line to full strength by May 1781. This delayed his departure to Virginia, however, where he had been sent to assist the Marquis de Lafayette against British forces operating there, and the Line's departure was delayed once more when the men complained about being paid in the nearly worthless Continental currency. In Virginia, Wayne led a small scouting force of 500 at the 1781 Battle of Green Spring to determine the location of Lord Charles Cornwallis, and they fell into a trap. Once again, Wayne held out against numerically superior forces until reinforced by Major John Wyllys. Cornwallis then attacked, and WayneLancaster, 319‚Äì22 led a bayonet charge against the British forces and then retreated in good order as night set in. This increased his reputation as a bold commander. After the British under General Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, Wayne went farther south and disbanded the British alliance with Indian tribes in Georgia. He then negotiated peace treaties with both the Creeks and the Cherokees, for which Georgia rewarded him with a large rice plantation. He was promoted to major general on October 10, 1783. Political career Statue of Wayne at Valley Forge, facing toward his home in nearby Paoli, Pennsylvania After the war, Wayne returned to Pennsylvania and served in the state legislature for a year in 1784. He then moved to Georgia and settled upon the tract of land that had been granted to him for his military service. He was a delegate to the state convention that ratified the United States Constitution in 1788. In 1791, he served a year in the Second United States Congress as a Representative of Georgia's 1st congressional district. A House committee determined that electoral fraud had been committed in the 1790 election, and Wayne lost his seat over his residency qualifications. A special election was held on July 9, 1792, sending John Milledge to fill Wayne's vacant seat, and Wayne declined to run for re- election in 1792.United States Congressional Elections, 1788‚Äì1997: The Official Results confirms the seat was declared vacant on March 21, 1792. Later military career Major-General Anthony Wayne (pastel by James Sharples, Sr., c. 1795) President George Washington recalled Wayne from civilian life in order to lead an expedition in the Northwest Indian War which had been a disaster for the United States up till that point, particularly with the news of St. Clair's Defeat. Many American Indians in the Northwest Territory had sided with the British in the Revolutionary War, but the British had ceded any sovereignty over the land to the United States in the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The Indians living in the region quickly became embroiled in conflicts with American settlers who were flooding into the region in the aftermath of the war. The Western Confederacy achieved major victories in 1790 and 1791 under the leadership of Blue Jacket of the Shawnees and Little Turtle of the Miami tribe. They were encouraged and supplied by the British, who had refused to evacuate their fortifications in the region despite having agreed to do so in the Treaty of Paris, pointing to American refusal to honor the debt-agreements that they had agreed to pay as signs that the Treaty was not yet applicable. Washington placed Wayne in command of a newly formed military force called the \\"Legion of the United States\\", and Wayne established a basic training facility at Legionville to prepare professional soldiers for his force. This was the first attempt to provide basic training for regular Army recruits, and Legionville was the first facility established expressly for this purpose. Wayne then dispatched a force to Ohio to establish Fort Recovery as a base of operations at the location of St. Clair's Defeat, and the fort became a magnet for military skirmishes in the summer of 1794. Wayne's army continued north, building strategically defensive forts ahead of the main force. A tree fell on Wayne's tent on August 3, 1794, at Fort Adams in northern Mercer County. He was knocked unconscious, but he recovered sufficiently to resume the march the next day to the newly built Fort Defiance.Carter, 133 On August 20, 1794, he mounted an assault on the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in Maumee, Ohio, which was a decisive victory for the U.S. forces and ended the war. Wayne then continued to Kekionga where he oversaw the construction of Fort Wayne. He then negotiated the Treaty of Greenville between the tribal confederacy and the United States, which was signed on August 3, 1795. The treaty gave most of Ohio to the United States and cleared the way for the state to enter the Union in 1803. Anthony Wayne letter to Colonel Meigs, November 25, 1795 Wayne died of complications from gout on December 15, 1796, during a return trip to Pennsylvania from a military post in Detroit. He was buried at Fort Presque Isle where the modern Wayne Blockhouse stands. His son Isaac Wayne disinterred the body in 1809 and had the corpse boiled to remove the surviving flesh from the bones. He then placed the bones into two saddlebags and relocated them to the family plot in the graveyard of St. David's Episcopal Church in Wayne, Pennsylvania.Hugh T. Harrington and Lisa A. Ennis. \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne: His Body Did Not Rest in Peace, citing History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, vol. 1. pp. 211‚Äì12. Warner, Beers & Co., Chicago. 1884. The other remains were reburied and discovered in 1878, giving General Wayne two known grave sites. There is a legend which claims that many bones were lost along the roadway which encompasses much of U.S. Route 322, and that his ghost wanders the highway on January 1 (Wayne's birthday) searching for his lost bones.Wood, Maureen & Kolek, Ron (2010).

The post office issued a series of stamps often referred to as the \\"Two Cent Reds\\" by collectors, most of them issued to commemorate the 150th anniversaries of the many events that occurred during the American Revolution.

Headquartered in Amstelveen, the Netherlands, although incorporated in the United Kingdom, KPMG is a network of firms in 147 countries, with over 219,000 employees and has three lines of services: financial audit, tax, and advisory. Its tax and advisory services are further divided into various service groups. The name \\"KPMG\\" stands for \\"Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler\\". It was chosen when KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) merged with Peat Marwick in 1987.

In 1818 John Moxham opened a company in Bristol. James Grace and James Grace Jr. bought John Moxham & Co. and renamed it James Grace & Son in 1857. In 1861, Henry Grace joined James Jr. and the company was renamed James & Henry Grace; the firm evolved to become Grace, Ryland & Co. William Barclay Peat joined Robert Fletcher & Co. in London in 1870 at the age of 17 and became head of the firm in 1891, renamed William Barclay Peat & Co. by then. In 1877, Thomson McLintock founded Thomson McLintock & Co in Glasgow. In 1897, Marwick Mitchell & Co. was founded by James Marwick and Roger Mitchell in New York City. In 1899, Ferdinand William LaFrentz founded the American Audit Co., in New York. In 1923, The American Audit Company was renamed FW LaFrentz & Co. In about 1913, Frank Wilber Main founded Main & Co. in Pittsburgh. In March 1917, Piet Klijnveld and Jaap Kraayenhof opened an accounting firm called Klynveld Kraayenhof & Co. in Amsterdam. In 1925, William Barclay Peat & Co. and Marwick Mitchell & Co., merged to form Peat Marwick Mitchell.Family tree: Peat Marwick McLintock ICEAW In 1963, Main LaFrentz & Co was formed by the merger of Main & Co and FW LaFrentz & Co. In 1969 Thomson McLintock and Main LaFrentz merged forming McLintock Main LaFrentz International and McLintock Main LaFrentz International absorbed the general practice of Grace, Ryland & Co. In 1979, Klynveld Kraayenhof & Co. (Netherlands), McLintock Main LaFrentz (United Kingdom / United States) and Deutsche Treuhandgesellschaft (Germany) formed KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) as a grouping of independent national practices to create a strong European- based international firm. Deutsche Treuhandgesellschaft CEO Reinhard Goerdeler (son of leading anti-Nazi activist Carl Goerdeler, who would have become Chancellor if Operation Valkyrie had succeeded) became the first CEO of KMG. In the United States, Main Lafrentz & Co. merged with Hurdman and Cranstoun to form Main Hurdman & Cranstoun. In 1987, KMG and Peat Marwick joined forces in the first mega-merger of large accounting firms and formed a firm called KPMG in the United States, and most of the rest of the world, and Peat Marwick McLintock in the United Kingdom. In the Netherlands, as a consequence of the merger between PMI and KMG in 1988, PMI tax advisors joined Meijburg & Co. (The tax advisory agency Meijburg & Co. was founded by Willem Meijburg, Inspector of National Taxes, in 1939). Today, the Netherlands is the only country with two members of KPMG International: KPMG Audit (accountants) and Meijburg & Co (tax consultants). In 1991, the firm was renamed KPMG Peat Marwick, and in 1999, the name was reduced again to KPMG.Note: KPMG derived from predecessor company founders: Piet Klijnveld, William Barclay Peat, James Marwick, and Reinhard Goerdeler. In October 1997, KPMG and Ernst & Young announced that they were to merge. However, while the merger to form PricewaterhouseCoopers was granted regulatory approval, the KPMG/Ernst & Young tie-up was later abandoned. = Recent history = KPMG building in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada In 2001, KPMG spun off its United States consulting firm through an initial public offering of KPMG Consulting, which was rebranded BearingPoint. In early 2009, BearingPoint filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The UK and Dutch consulting arms were sold to Atos in 2002. In 2003, KPMG divested itself of its legal arm, Klegal and KPMG sold its Dispute Advisory Services to FTI Consulting. KPMG's member firms in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein merged to form KPMG Europe LLP in October 2007. These member firms were followed by Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, CIS (Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Georgia), Turkey, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. They appointed joint Chairmen, John Griffith-Jones and Ralf Nonnenmacher. In 2020 KPMG International Limited was incorporated in London, United Kingdom.  Global structure  Each national KPMG firm is an independent legal entity and is a member of KPMG International Limited, a UK Limited Company incorporated in London, United Kingdom. KPMG International changed its legal structure from a Swiss Verein to a co-operative under Swiss law in 2003Handelsregister des Kantons Zug (Registration Number CH-020.6.900.276-5) and to a limited company in 2020. This structure in which the Limited company provides support services only to the member firms is similar to other professional services networks. The member firms provide the services to client. The purpose is to limit the liability of each independent member.This is illustrated in the cases involving Parmalat where clients sought to hold Deloitte (the Swiss Verein)and Grant Thornton International (a UK company providing administrative services to its members) liable for the negligence of other member firms. Bill Thomas is KPMG's Global Chairman. He was formerly Senior Partner and CEO of KPMG LLP, the KPMG member firm in Canada. Some KPMG member firms are registered as multidisciplinary entities which also provide legal services in certain jurisdictions. In India, regulations do not permit foreign auditing firms to operate. Hence KPMG carries out audits in India under the name of BSR & Co, an auditing firm that it bought. BSR & Co was an auditing firm founded by B.S. Raut in Mumbai. In 1992, after India was forced to liberalise as one of the conditions of the World Bank and IMF bail out, KPMG was granted a license to operate in India as an investment bank. It subsequently purchased BSR & Co and conducts audits in India under the name of this firm.  Services  KPMG is organised into the following three service lines (the 2018 revenue shares are listed in parentheses): * Audit (39%) * Advisory (39%) * Tax (22%) Tax arrangements relating to tax avoidance and multinational corporations and Luxembourg which were negotiated by KPMG became public in 2014 in the so-called Luxembourg Leaks.  Staff  KPMG was the preferred employer among the Big Four accounting firms according to CollegeGrad.com. It was also ranked No. 4 on the list of \\"50 Best Places to Launch a Career\\" in 2009 according to Bloomberg Businessweek. It was reported in early 2012 that KPMG has about 11,000 staff in the UK and 9,000 in mainland China and Hong Kong. KPMG's global deputy chairman predicted that headcount in China would overtake that of the UK by the end of 2013. Controversies =Tax shelter fraud= In 2003, the IRS issued summonses to KPMG for information about certain tax shelters and their investors. In February 2004, the US Justice Department commenced a criminal inquiry. The United States member firm, KPMG LLP, was accused by the United States Department of Justice of fraud in marketing abusive tax shelters. KPMG fired or forced the retirement of over a dozen who were involved. KPMG LLP admitted criminal wrongdoing in creating fraudulent tax shelters to help wealthy clients avoid $2.5 billion in taxes between 1996 and 2002, and agreed to pay $456 million in penalties to avoid indictment. Under the deferred prosecution agreement, KPMG LLP would not face criminal prosecution if it complied with the terms of its agreement with the government. On 3 January 2007, the criminal conspiracy charges against KPMG were dropped. =Various= In 2003, KPMG agreed to pay $125 million and $75 million to settle lawsuits stemming from the firm's audits of Rite Aid and Oxford Health Plans Inc., respectively. In 2004, KPMG agreed to pay $115 million to settle lawsuits stemming from the collapse of software company Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products NV. In 2006, Fannie Mae sued KPMG for malpractice for approving years of erroneous financial statements. In February 2007, KPMG Germany was investigated for ignoring questionable payments in the Siemens bribery case. In November 2008, the Siemens Supervisory Board recommended changing auditors from KPMG to Ernst & Young. In March 2008, KPMG was accused of enabling \\"improper and imprudent practices\\" at New Century Financial, a failed mortgage company, and KPMG agreed to pay $80 million to settle suits from Xerox shareholders over manipulated earnings reports. It was announced in December 2008 that two of Tremont Group's Rye Select funds, audited by KPMG, had $2.37 billion invested with the Madoff \\"Ponzi scheme.\\" Class action suits were filed. In August 2010, it was reported by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority to the Swedish accountancy regulator after HQ Bank was forced into involuntary liquidation after the Financial Supervisory Authority revoked all its licences for breach of banking regulations. In August 2011, KPMG conducted due diligence work on Hewlett Packard's $11.1 billion acquisition of the British software company Autonomy. In November 2012 HP announced an $8.8 billion write off due to \\"serious accounting improprieties\\" committed by Autonomy management prior to the acquisition. According to an independent panel formed to investigate irregular payments made by Olympus which reported in December 2011, KPMG's affiliate in Japan did not identify fraud at the company. In April 2013, Scott London, a former KPMG LLP partner in charge of KPMG's US Los Angeles-based Pacific Southwest audit practice, admitted passing on stock tips about clients, including Herbalife, Skechers, and other companies, to his friend Bryan Shaw, a California jewelry-store owner. In return Shaw gave London $70,000 as well as gifts that included a $12,000 Rolex watch and concert tickets. On 6 May, Shaw agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He also agreed to pay around $1.3 million in restitution, and to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal with federal prosecutors. This scandal led KPMG to resign as auditor for Herbalife and Sketchers. In 2015, KPMG was accused by the Canada Revenue Agency of tax evasion schemes: \\"The CRA alleges that the KPMG tax structure was in reality a 'sham' that intended to deceive the taxman.\\" In 2016, the Canada Revenue Agency was found to have offered an amnesty to KPMG clients caught using an offshore tax-avoidance scheme on the Isle of Man. In 2017, KPMG terminated five partners in its audit practice, including the head of its audit practice in the US, after an investigation of advanced confidential knowledge of planned audit inspections by its Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. This followed criticism about KPMG's failure to uncover illegal sales practices at Wells Fargo or potential corruption at FIFA, the governing international body of football. It was reported in 2017 that KPMG had the highest number of deficiencies, among the Big Four, cited by its regulator in the previous two years. This includes two annual inspections that were compromised as a result of advanced access to inspection information. In March 2019, David Middendorf and Jeffrey Wada, co-defendants in the scandal, were convicted. In 2017, KPMG paid a $6.2 million fine to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for inadequacies in its audit of the financial statements of oil and gas company, Miller Energy Resources. In November 2017, 91 partners of KPMG faced contempt proceedings in Hong Kong High Court, as China Medical Technologies (CMED) liquidators investigating a $400 million fraud took action against KPMG with regard to its refusal to honor a February 2016 court order to produce Chinese working papers, correspondence, and records to the liquidators.Costello, Eugene (20 December 2017). \\"KPMG partners facing Hong Kong contempt proceedings,\\" International Investment.Miller, Matthew (20 December 2017). \\"Exclusive: KPMG partners face court contempt over China audit,\\" Reuters.\\"KPMG partners face court contempt proceedings in Hong Kong over China audit; The accounting firm has refused to hand over audit papers relating to China Medical Technologies despite a 2016 court order,\\" South China Morning Post, 20 December 2017.\\"Timeline: U.S., HK regulators struggle to get China audit papers,\\" Reuters, 20 December 2017.\\"Contempt hit looms for KPMG,\\" The Standard, 21 December 2017. The liquidators are asking that 91 defendants be held in contempt of court, which could result in criminal penalties, or weekly fines. KPMG had issued written audit reports for CMED from 2003 to 2008, and was replaced by PwC Zhong Tian in August 2009. \\"Perhaps locking up 91 KPMG partners over Christmas may spur the firms to find a solution to this problem\\", said Professor Paul Gillis of Peking University's Guanghua School of Management. In November 2018, the Sultanate of Oman's Capital Market Authority (CMA) suspended KPMG from auditing entities regulated by the CMA for a period of one year after discovering major financial and accounting irregularities in the entities' records.Times of Oman, CMA suspends firm from auditing regulated entities, retrieved on 14 November 2018.

Archived at the Wayback machine In 2019 KPMG were fined ¬£5 million by the Financial Reporting Council for misconduct shortly after the takeover of the Britannia Building Society by The Co-operative Bank, particularly relating to the valuation of Britannia's commercial loans and other liabilities. The takeover led to the near collapse of The Co-operative Bank. =Carillion audit role= In January 2018, it was announced that KPMG, auditor of collapsed UK construction firm Carillion, would have its role examined by the Financial Reporting Council, (FRC) and it was summoned to give evidence before two House of Commons select committees on 22 February 2018. On 13 February 2018, the 'Big 4' accountancy firms, including KPMG, were described by MP Frank Field as \\"feasting on what was soon to become a carcass\\" after collecting fees of ¬£72m for Carillion work during the years leading up to its collapse. KPMG was singled out for particular criticism for signing off Carillion's last accounts before a profit warning in July 2017: \\"Either KPMG failed to spot the warning signs, or its judgement was clouded by its cosy relationship with the company and the multimillion-pound fees it received,\\" said MP Rachel Reeves. Two out of three former Carillion finance directors had also worked for KPMG. KPMG defended itself, saying that in the construction industry \\"an accumulation of adverse events [...] can quite quickly cause a precipitous decline.\\" KPMG chairman and senior partner Bill Michael said: \\"It does not follow automatically from a company collapse either that the opinion of management was wrong, or that the auditor did a bad job.\\" On 22 February 2018, MPs contested evidence from KPMG (in one exchange MP Peter Kyle told KPMG partner Peter Meehan: \\"I would not hire you to do an audit of the contents of my fridge\\"). Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, said: > Auditing is a multi-million-pound business for the Big Four. On this > morning's evidence from KPMG and Deloitte, these audits appear to be a > colossal waste of time and money, fit only to provide false assurance to > investors, workers and the public. [...] Carillion staff and investors could > see the problems at the company but those responsible - auditors, > regulators, and, ultimately, the directors ‚Äì did nothing to stop Carillion > being driven off a cliff. The final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into Carillion's collapse, published on 16 May 2018, criticised KPMG for its \\"complicity\\" in the company's financial reporting practices: > KPMG audited Carillion for 19 years, pocketing ¬£29 million in the process. > Not once during that time did they qualify their audit opinion on the > financial statements, instead signing off the figures put in front of them > by the company's directors. Yet, had KPMG been prepared to challenge > management, the warning signs were there in highly questionable assumptions > about construction contract revenue and the intangible asset of goodwill > accumulated in historic acquisitions. These assumptions were fundamental to > the picture of corporate health presented in audited annual accounts. In > failing to exercise‚Äîand voice‚Äîprofessional scepticism towards Carillion's > aggressive accounting judgements, KPMG was complicit in them. It should take > its own share of responsibility for the consequences. The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain's corporate governance regime, saying the government had \\"lacked the decisiveness or bravery\\" to do so, accused the big four accounting firms of operating as a \\"cosy club\\", with KPMG singled out for its \\"complicity\\" in signing off Carillion's \\"increasingly fantastical figures\\". KPMG said: > We believe we conducted our audit appropriately. However, it's only right > that following a corporate collapse of such size and significance, the > necessary investigations are performed. Auditing large and complex > businesses involves many judgments and we will continue to cooperate with > the FRC's ongoing investigation. ... We welcome any future review of our > profession. If we consider how the profession has changed in the last decade > [‚Ä¶] it is clear there is a need for us to look closely at our business > models. In a June 2018 report on audit standards across eight accounting firms, the FRC identified \\"failure to challenge management and show appropriate scepticism across their audits.\\" It highlighted a decline in the quality of work undertaken by the Big Four, with KPMG performing the worst. There had, the FRC said, been an \\"unacceptable deterioration\\" in the quality of KPMG's work, and the FRC would scrutinise KPMG more closely as a result. In October 2018, the FRC proposed reforms to tackle the \\"underlying falling trust in business and the effectiveness of audit,\\" and severely rebuked KPMG. In November 2018, KPMG said it would no longer undertake consultancy work for FTSE 350 Index-listed companies if it was also auditing them, in an effort to \\"remove even the perception of a possible conflict\\" of interest. The Carillion investigation followed FRC investigations into KPMG's role at HBOS, Quindell and The Co-operative Bank. In July 2018, the FRC started an investigation into KPMG's audit role at collapsed drinks merchant Conviviality. In January 2019, KPMG announced it had suspended the partner that led Carillion's audit and three members of his team, and the FRC opened a second investigation into how KPMG audited Carillion's accounts. In May 2020, the FT reported that the official receiver was preparing to sue KPMG for ¬£250m over alleged negligence in its audits of Carillion. The FRC's first report, which found a number of breaches, was delivered to KPMG in September 2020; the FRC was awaiting a KPMG response before deciding whether to take enforcement action. =Alterations to past audit work= In June 2019, KPMG was fined $50 million for altering its past audit work after receiving stolen data from accounting industry watch dog Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). KPMG admitted to its mistakes and as a part of its settlement, it also agreed to hire an independent consultant to review its internal controls. =2017 South African corruption scandal= In 2017, KPMG was embroiled in related scandals involving the Gupta family. KPMG, whose history in South Africa dated back to 1895, and which had been part of the international organization since its founding in 1979, faced calls for closure, and an uncertain future, as a consequence of the damage done to the South African economy as a result of its activities. KPMG had been working with a Gupta family company in the mining sector, Oakbay Resources and Energy, for 15 years prior to the revelations of corruption and collusion in 2016, at which point KPMG resigned. The full impact and financial profit that KPMG received is yet to be determined; however, at least one large company has terminated its services with KPMG due to its relationship with Oakbay. In July 2017, after controversial documents were leaked by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, former chief executive of KPMG South Africa and the former partner that was responsible for audits related to the Gupta family, Moses Kgosana, withdrew from becoming the chairman of Alexander Forbes, a financial services firm. In 2015, KPMG issued a controversial report that implicated former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in the creation of an illegal intelligence gathering unit of the South African Revenue Service (SARS). This report was seen by elements of the media to be part of a wider Gupta-linked state capture conspiracy, with the aim of forcing Gordhan out of his post. The report was withdrawn by KPMG in September 2017, earning the ire of the Commissioner of SARS, Tom Moyane. After an internal investigation that found work done for the Gupta family fell \\"considerably short\\" of the firm's standards and amid rising political and public backlash, KPMG's senior leadership in South Africa, including its chairman Ahmed Jaffer, CEO Trevor Hoole, COO Steven Louw, and five partners, resigned in September 2017. Save South Africa, a civil-society group, accused KPMG and UK PR firm Bell Pottinger of playing a \\"central role in facilitating state capture.\\" Numerous South African companies either fired KPMG in the immediate aftermath of the scandal, or were reconsidering their relationships with the firm with the international chairman of KPMG, John Veihmeyer, apologising for the conduct of the South African arm and the firm pledged to donate fees earned from Gupta businesses, as well as the withdrawn SARS report to anti-corruption activities.  Sponsorship  KPMG Europe headquarters in the Squaire building at Frankfurt Airport The Swedish member firm was the main sponsor for Swedish biathlete Magdalena Forsberg, six-time world champion and two-time Olympic medalist. Forsberg was working as a tax consultant at the KPMG Sundsvall office parallel to her athletic career. In February 2008, Phil Mickelson, ranked one of the best golfers in the world, signed a three-year global sponsorship deal with KPMG. As part of the agreement, Mickelson was to wear the KPMG logo on his headwear during all golf related appearances. The Canadian member firm sponsored skier Alexandre Bilodeau, who won the first gold medal for Canada on home soil in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Alexandre's father is a tax partner in the Montreal office. KPMG and McLaren Technology Group have formed a strategic alliance to apply McLaren Applied Technologies' (MAT) predictive analytics and technology to KPMG's audit and advisory services. McLaren 2015 Formula 1 car has the KPMG logo engraved above the pilot seat. Since 2016, KPMG has been strategic sponsor of Brain Bar, a Budapest-based, annually held festival on the future.  Awards  KPMG ranked in the top two overall in Consultancy Rankings 2009 by OpRisk & Compliance ‚Äì in recognition of KPMG's experience in risk management. In 2011, the company was ranked second on the World's Best Outsourcing Advisors ‚Äì in recognition of the firm's depth of experience, global reach and holistic approach. That same year, the company was inducted into Working Mother Hall of Fame after being honored for 15 years as one of Working Mother magazine's 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers. KPMG was ranked number 13 in Consulting Magazine's Best Firms to Work for in 2016. In 2017, KPMG was ranked 29th on the Fortune list of 100 best companies to work for. That same year, KPMG, along with PwC, Deloitte, and PA Consulting Group, were among the UK's 25 top companies to work for.

During these spates of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed in unofficial or mob actions by Calvinist Protestant crowds as part of the Protestant Reformation. Most of the destruction was of art in churches and public places. Protestant polemical print celebrating the destruction, 1566 The Dutch term usually specifically refers to the wave of disorderly attacks in the summer of 1566 that spread rapidly through the Low Countries from south to north. Similar outbreaks of iconoclasm took place in other parts of Europe, especially in Switzerland and the Holy Roman Empire in the period between 1522 and 1566, notably Z√ºrich (in 1523), Copenhagen (1530), M√ºnster (1534), Geneva (1535), and Augsburg (1537).John Phillips, Reformation of Images: Destruction of Art in England, 1535‚Äì1660, (Berkeley: University of California Press) 1973. In England there was both government-sponsored removal of images and also spontaneous attacks from 1535 onwards, and in Scotland from 1559. In France there were several outbreaks as part of the French Wars of Religion from 1560 onwards. Background In France unofficial episodes of large scale destruction of art in churches by Huguenot Calvinists had begun in 1560; unlike in the Low Countries they were often physically resisted and repulsed by Roman Catholic crowds, but were to continue throughout the French Wars of Religion.Eire, 279‚Äì280 In Anglican England much destruction had already taken place in an organized fashion under orders from the government, while in Northern Europe, groups of Calvinists marched through churches and removed images, a move which \\"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\\" in Germany and \\"antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox\\" in the Baltic region. A German woodcut of 1530 titled Klagrede der armen verfolgten G√∂tzen und Tempelbilder (English: \\"Complaint of the poor persecuted idols and temple pictures\\") by Erhard Sch√∂n. In Germany, Switzerland and England, conversion to Protestantism had been enforced on the whole population at the level of a city, principality or kingdom, with varying degrees of discrimination, persecution or expulsion applied to those who insisted on remaining Roman Catholic. The Low Countries, Flanders, Brabant and Holland,What is now approximately Belgian Limburg was part of the Bishopric of Li√®ge and ruled by the bishop (shown in brown on the map). were part of the inheritance of Philip II of Spain, who was a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the Counter-Reformation, and suppressed Protestantism through his Governor-general or Regent, Margaret of Parma the illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V, who was herself more willing to compromise. Although Protestants so far represented only a relatively small proportion of the Netherlandish population, but including disproportionate numbers from the nobility and upper bourgeoisie, the Catholic Church had evidently lost the loyalty of the population, and traditional Catholic anti-clericalism was now dominant.Elliott, 90‚Äì91 The region affected was perhaps the richest in Europe, but still seethed with economic discontent among parts of the population, and had suffered a poor harvest and hard winter. However, recent historians are generally less inclined to see the movement as prompted by these factors than was the case a few decades ago.Arnade, 95‚Äì98, and 116, especially note 105 (where \\"reputation\\" is presumably a misprint for \\"refutation\\"). Elliott, 89‚Äì91, first written in 1968, reflects a version of the older view, for which the German Marxist historian Erich Kuttner was the standard-bearer.Pollmann, 179-80. An outdoor sermon (The Preaching of St. John the Baptist) depicted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, apparently in 1565, the year before the Beeldenstorm movement began. The Beeldenstorm grew out of a turn in the behaviour of Low Country Protestants starting around 1560, who became increasingly open in their religion, despite penal sanctions. Catholic preachers were interrupted in sermons, and raids were organized to rescue Protestant prisoners from jail, who then often fled into exile in France or England. Protestant views were spread by a large movement of \\"field sermons\\" or open-air sermons () held outside towns, and therefore out of the jurisdiction of the town authorities. The first took place on the Cloostervelt near Hondschoote, in what is now the arrondissement of Dunkirk in French Flanders, very close to where the attacks later began, and the first one to be armed against disruption was held near Boeschepe on July 12, 1562, two months after religious war had broken out again over the (then) French border just nearby.Petegree, 74‚Äì75 These open-air sermons, mostly by Anabaptist or Mennonite preachers, spread through the country, attracting huge crowds, though not necessarily of those leaning to Protestantism, and in many places immediately preceded the iconoclastic attacks of August 1566. Prosecutions for heresy continued, especially in the south, although they were erratic, and in some places clergy of clearly heretical views were appointed to churches. By 1565 the authorities seem to have realized that persecution was not the answer, and the level of prosecutions slackened, and the Protestants became increasingly confident in the open.Petegree, 82‚Äì86 A letter of July 22, 1566, from local officials to the Regent, warned that \\"the scandalous pillage of churches, monasteries and abbeys\\" was imminent.Arnade, 97 Low Countries iconoclastic attacks in 1566 Blue: The spread of the Beeldenstorm in the Low Countries. Brown: Within the independent Bishopric of Li√®ge (Luik). On August 10, 1566, the feast-day of Saint Lawrence, at the end of the pilgrimage from Hondschoote to Steenvoorde, the chapel of the Sint-Laurensklooster was defaced by a crowd who invaded the building. It has been suggested that the rioters connected the saint especially with Philip II, whose monastery palace of the Escorial near Madrid was dedicated to Lawrence, and was just nearing completion in 1566.Arnade, 103‚Äì104 Iconoclastic attacks spread rapidly northwards and resulted in the destruction of not only images but all sorts of decoration and fittings in churches and other church or clergy property. However, there was relatively little loss of life, unlike similar outbreaks in France, where the clergy were often killed, and some iconoclasts too.Arnade, 116 The attacks reached the commercial centre of the Low Countries, Antwerp, on August 20, and on August 22 Ghent, where the cathedral, eight churches, twenty-five monasteries and convents, ten hospitals and seven chapels were wrecked. From there, it further spread east and north, reaching Amsterdam, then a much smaller town, by August 23, and continuing in the far north and east into October, although the main towns were mostly attacked in August. Valenciennes (\\"Valencijn\\" on the map) was the most southerly town attacked. In the east, Maastricht on September 20 and Venlo on October 5 saw attacks, but generally the outbreaks were restricted to more westerly and northern areas.See map with dates in Petegree, 118; Arnade, 90‚Äì91 Over 400 churches were attacked in Flanders alone.Eire, 280 The eye-witness Richard Clough, a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, saw: \\"all the churches, chapels and houses of religion utterly defaced, and no kind of thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few folks that it is to be marvelled at.\\" The Church of Our Lady in Antwerp, later made the cathedral (illustrated at top): \\"looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine [short], I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed.\\"Spicer, 109 (spelling modernized); see also Arnade, 146‚Äì148Eye- witness Account of Image-breaking at Antwerp, Universiteit Leiden Nicolas Sander, an English Catholic exile who was a professor of theology at Louvain, described the destruction in the same church: > ... these fresh followers of this new preaching threw down the graven > [sculpted] and defaced the painted images, not only of Our Lady but of all > others in the town. They tore the curtains, dashed in pieces the carved work > of brass and stone, brake the altars, spoilt the clothes and corporesses, > wrested the irons, conveyed away or brake the chalices and vestiments, > pulled up the brass of the gravestones, not sparing the glass and seats > which were made about the pillars of the church for men to sit in. ... the > Blessed Sacrament of the altar ... they trod under their feet and (horrible > it is to say!) shed their stinking piss upon it ... these false bretheren > burned and rent not only all kind of Church books, but, moreover, destroyed > whole libraries of books of all sciences and tongues, yea the Holy > Scriptures and the ancient fathers, and tore in pieces the maps and charts > of the descriptions of countries.Miola, 58‚Äì59, 59 quoted Damaged relief statues in the Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht. Such details are corroborated by many other sources. Accounts of the actions of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a considerable element of carnival to the outbreaks, with much mockery of the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went about their work. Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.Arnade, 105‚Äì111 The destruction frequently included ransacking the priest's house, and sometimes private houses suspected of sheltering church goods. There was much looting of common household goods from clergy houses and monasteries, and some street robberies of women's jewellery by the crowd; after the images were smashed and the property occupied, \\"men fed their stomachs in a carnivalesque indulgence of beer, bread, butter and cheese, while women carted off provisions for the kitchen or bedroom\\".Arnade, 111‚Äì112 (quote from 112); 102 for women's jewellery robbed. A later book illustration of the destruction in Antwerp, 1727 There are many accounts of rituals of inversion, in which the church sometimes stood for the whole social order. Children sometimes participated enthusiastically, and street games afterwards became play battles between \\"papists\\" and \\"beggars\\". One child was killed in Amsterdam by a stone thrown in such a game.Arnade, 111‚Äì114; for the whole paragraph: 104‚Äì122 Elsewhere the iconoclasts seemed to treat their actions as a job of work; in one city the group waited for the bell rung to mark the start of the working day before beginning their work. The tombs and memorial inscriptions of the patriciate and nobility, and in some cases royalty, were defaced or destroyed in several places, although secular public buildings such as town halls, and the palaces of the nobility, were not attacked.Arnade, 116‚Äì124 In Ghent, on the one hand the memorial in a church to Charles V's sister Isabel (and so Philip's aunt) was carefully left alone, but a statue in the street of Charles V and the Virgin was destroyed.Arnade, 119‚Äì120 The actions were controversial among Protestants, some of whom implausibly tried to blame Catholic agent provocateurs,Petegree, 117‚Äì119 as it became clear that \\"the more popular elements of the dissident movement were out of control\\".Wells, 91 Protestant ministers and activists returning from exile in England and elsewhere played a significant role, and individual wealthy Protestants were widely suspected of hiring men to do the work in some places, especially Antwerp.Petegree, 116‚Äì117, and elsewhere, on returning exiles; Arnade, 146‚Äì147 on paid iconoclasts In some rural areas gangs of iconoclasts moved across country between village churches and monasteries for several days.Arnade, 101‚Äì102; 104‚Äì109 Elsewhere there were large crowds involved, sometimes locals, and sometimes from outside the area. In some places the nobility gave assistance, ordering the clearing of churches on their estates. Local magistracies were often opposed, but ineffective in stopping the destruction.Petegree, 119‚Äì124; Arnade, 120‚Äì122 In many towns the archer's guild, who had a function in controlling public order, took no steps against the crowds.Arnade, 120 In 1566, unlike the situation after the Eighty Years War and today, Protestantism in the Low Countries was mainly concentrated in the south (roughly modern Belgium), and much weaker in the north (roughly now the Netherlands), and iconoclasm in the north began later, after news of the events in Antwerp was received, and was more successfully resisted by local authorities in some towns, although still succeeding in most. Once again individually socially prominent laymen often took the lead.Petegree, 124‚Äì128 In many places there were, or were later said to have been, false claims of official commissions from some local authority to perform the actions, and by the end of the outbreak some northern towns removed images by order of the local authority, presumably to prevent the disorder that would accompany a mob action.Arnade, 120‚Äì122 Analysis of the records of the later trials show a wide range of occupations, covering craftsmen and small tradespeople, especially in the textile trade, and also a variety of church employees, at a fairly low level. Where wealth and property are recorded, it is \\"modest at best\\".Arnade, 102 \\"Stille beeldenstorm\\" of 1581 in Antwerp Following the 1566 attacks in Antwerp there was a further period of iconoclasm there in 1581, after a Calvinist city council was elected and purged the city's clergy and guilds of Catholic office-holders. This is known as the \\"quiet\\" or \\"stille\\" beeldenstorm, as the removal of images was carried out by the institutions they belonged to, the council itself, churches and the guilds. Some images were sold rather than destroyed, but most seem to have been lost. By the summer of 1584 Antwerp was besieged by the Duke of Parma's Spanish army, falling a year later.Freedberg, 133 Artistic losses The looting of the Churches of Lyon by Calvinists in 1562. Rarely was any thought given to the artistic heritage of these cities in 1566, though families were sometimes able to protect the church monuments of their ancestors, and in Delft the syndics of the painters' Guild of Saint Luke were able to rescue the altarpiece by Maarten van Heemskerck, which the guild had commissioned only 15 years earlier.Montias, 4 The van Eycks' Ghent Altarpiece, then as now famous as a supreme example of Early Netherlandish painting and already a major tourist attraction, just restored in 1550, was saved by dismantling it and hiding it in the cathedral tower. A first attack on August 19 was deterred by a small number of guards. When a larger attack was made at night two days later the iconoclasts had provided themselves with a tree trunk as a battering ram, and succeeded in breaking through the doors.Charney, 72‚Äì73 - a populist account; when he says April he means August, and \\"The Lamb\\" refers to the altarpiece. Petegree, 118 has the Beeldenstorm reaching Ghent on August 22. See also Arnade, 118 Damaged reliefs in St Medarduskerk, Wervik 1681 illustration to Hugo de Groot's history By then the panels had been removed from the frame and hidden, with the guards, on the narrow spiral staircase up the tower, with a locked door at ground level. They were not detected and the crowd left after destroying what else they could find. The panels were then moved to the town hall, and only returned to view in 1569, by which time the elaborate frame had disappeared. The artistic and literary losses were elaborately described by Marcus van Vaernewyck in his journal Van die beroerlicke tijden in die Nederlanden en voornamelick in Ghendt 1566-1568. The original manuscript of his journal is still preserved in the Ghent University Library. Despite militia guards, two of the three main churches in Leiden were attacked; in the Pieterskerk the choirbooks and altarpiece by Lucas van Leyden were preserved. In the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam an altarpiece with a central panel by Jan van Scorel and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck was lost. The most important works of several painters, especially those like Pieter Aertsen who worked in Antwerp,Gustav Friedrich Waagen, were all destroyed, leading to a somewhat distorted view of the art history of the period. An altarpiece in Culemborg had been commissioned in 1557 from the painter Jan Dey, was then destroyed in 1566 and in 1570 recommissioned from Dey, apparently as a copy of the first. However the new work was only in place for five years before it was removed when the town went officially Calvinist.Jacobs, Lynn F., review of Liesbeth M.

On August 23, Margaret of Parma, the Habsburg Regent or Governor-general, whose capital of Brussels was unaffected by the movement, agreed to an \\"Accord\\" with the group of aristocratic Protestant leaders known as the \\"Compromise\\" or Geuzen (\\"Beggars\\"), by which freedom of religion was granted, in exchange for allowing Catholics to worship unmolested and an end to the violence. Instead, \\"the outbreak of the iconoclastic fury began an almost uninterrupted series of skirmishes, campaigns, plunder, pirate-raids, and other acts of violence. Not all areas suffered violence at the same time or to the same extent, but practically none remained unscathed.\\"Lesger, 110 Many elite Protestants were now alarmed by the forces unleashed, and some of the nobility began to shift towards support of the government. Implementing the somewhat vague terms of the agreement led to further tensions, and William of Orange, appointed by Margaret to resolve the situation in Antwerp, tried and failed to produce a wider settlement that all parties could live with. Instead unrest continued and the episode fed into the causes of the Dutch Revolt which was to erupt two years later.Elliott, 91‚Äì93; Petegree, 132‚Äì134; Wells, 89‚Äì91; Arnade, 100 On August 29,1566 Margaret wrote a somewhat panicked letter to Philip, \\"claiming that half the population were infected with heresy, and that over 200,000 people were up in arms against her authority\\". Philip decided to send the Duke of Alba with an army; he would have led them himself but was kept in Spain by other matters, especially the increasingly evident insanity of his heir, Carlos, Prince of Asturias. When Alba arrived the following year, and soon replaced Margaret as Governor-general, his heavy- handed repression, which included the execution of many convicted of iconoclastic attacks the summer before, only made the situation worse. Antwerp was then Europe's largest financial and international trading centre, taking as much as 75 or 80% of English exports of cloth,Ramsay, 62‚Äì63 and the disturbances created serious and well-justified fears that its position as such was under threat. Sir Thomas Gresham, the English financier who arranged Elizabeth I's borrowings, and whose agent in Antwerp was Clough, left London for Antwerp on August 23, only hearing about the Antwerp attacks en route; he needed to roll-over 32,000 Flemish pounds and borrow another 20,000 to finance her expenses in Ireland. Dining with William of Orange on his arrival, he was asked if \\"the English were minded to depart this town or not\\", and wrote to William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief minister, \\"in alarm that he \\"liked none of their proceedings\\" but \\"apprehended great mischief\\", and urged that the English government \\"should do very well in time to consider some other realm and place\\" for marketing English products. It was a message that helped shape the course of events.\\"Ramsay, 50 The English had found the Antwerp money market short of funds since earlier in the year, and now made use of Cologne and Augsburg as well, but as events unfolded in the next year, and the personal position of some leading lenders became precarious, the English found to their surprise that repayments were no longer pressed for, probably as the lenders were happy to keep their money abroad on loan to a secure borrower.Ramsay, 50‚Äì51 The Dutch Revolt, which from 1585 onwards included a Dutch blockade of the River Scheldt leading to the city, was to finally destroy Antwerp as a major trading centre. The painting Beeldenstorm in een kerk, 1630, by Dirck van Delen, six decades after the original actions. In many places there were attempts by Calvinist preachers to take over the ransacked buildings. These were usually repulsed in the period after the attacks. In the months afterwards there were attempted negotiations in many cities, by William of Orange and others, to allocate certain churches to accommodate the local Protestants, often divided into Lutherans and Calvinists. These had mostly failed within a few weeks, not least because Margaret's government rejected them; she had already had an earlier attempt at compromise overruled by Philip a few months earlier, and been embarrassingly forced to retract a decree.Ramsay, 48 Instead there was a wave of building or adapting Calvinist \\"temples\\", though in the end none of these were to remain in use by the following year, and their layouts, which seem to have echoed early Swiss and Scottish Calvinist designs, are now largely unknown.Spicer, 110‚Äì118 Once the revolt proper had started, there were many further instances of clearing churches, some still unofficial and disorderly, but as cities became officially Protestant, increasingly undertaken by official order, like the Amsterdam Alteratie (\\"Alteration\\") of 1578. Altars, to which Calvinists, unlike Lutherans, took strong exception, were typically completely removed, and in some large churches, like Utrecht Cathedral, large tomb monuments put where they stood, partly to make their return more difficult if political conditions changed. After the Eighty Years War was finally over, in the cities and areas that became Protestant, the old Catholic churches were all or nearly all taken over by the new established church of the Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church, with other congregations left to shift for themselves.Spicer, 116‚Äì124, and following pages The bare and empty state of those churches left in Catholic hands after the hostilities eventually ended prompted a large programme of restocking with Catholic art, which had much to do with the vigour of Northern Mannerism and later Flemish Baroque painting, and many Gothic churches were given Baroque makeovers.Vlieghe, 4, 13 In the north, now very largely Protestant, religious art largely disappeared, and Dutch Golden Age painting concentrated on a wide range of secular subjects, such as genre painting, landscape art and still-lifes, with results that might sometimes have surprised the Protestant ministers who initiated the movement. According to one scholar, this \\"was not only a dramatic change in the function of art, it was the context in which our present concept of art, what the literary critic M. H. Abrams called \\"art as such\\", first began to take shape\\", replacing a \\"construction model\\" where art theory concerned itself with how makers created their works, with a \\"contemplation model\\" concerned with the effect of finished works on a \\"lone perceiver\\" or viewer.Wagner (short quotes from Abrams), 131 Images File:Foxe-martyrs-iconoclasm-1563.pngWoodcut of 1563 from Foxe's Book of Martyrs File:Guy B6.JPGDefaced tomb effigy of Bishop Guy of Avesnes, Utrecht cathedral See also * Catacomb saints * The Reformation and art * European wars of religion * History of Flanders, History of the Netherlands * Iconophobia#Iconophobia and the English Reformation Notes References *Arnade, Peter J., Beggars, Iconoclasts, and Civic Patriots: the Political Culture of the Dutch Revolt, Cornell University Press, 2008, , *Charney, Noah, Stealing the Mystic Lamb: The True Story of the World's Most Coveted Masterpiece, PublicAffairs, 2010, , *Eire, Carlos M.N., War Against the Idols: The Reformation of Worship from Erasmus to Calvin, Cambridge University Press, 1989, , *Elliott, J.H., Europe divided, 1559‚Äì1598, many edns, pages refs from Blackwell classic histories of Europe, Wiley- Blackwell, 2nd edn. 2000 (1st edn 1968), , *David Freedberg, \\"Painting and the Counter-Reformation\\", from the catalogue to The Age of Rubens, 1993, Boston/Toledo, Ohio, online PDF *Lesger, Cl√©, The rise of the Amsterdam market and information exchange: merchants, commercial expansion and change in the spatial economy of the Low Countries, c. 1550‚Äì1630, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, , *Miola, Robert S., Early modern Catholicism: an anthology of primary sources, Oxford University Press, 2007, , *Montias, John Michael.

The college was founded in 1326 as University Hall, making it the second-oldest surviving college of the University after Peterhouse. It was refounded in 1338 as Clare Hall by an endowment from Elizabeth de Clare, and took on its current name in 1856. Clare is famous for its chapel choir and for its gardens on \\"The Backs\\" (the back of the colleges that overlook the River Cam). The current Master is barrister Anthony Grabiner, Baron Grabiner. Clare is consistently one of the most popular Cambridge colleges amongst prospective applicants. History The college was founded in 1326 by the university's Chancellor, Richard Badew, and was originally named University Hall. Providing maintenance for only two fellows, it soon hit financial hardship. In 1338, the college was refounded as Clare Hall by an endowment from Elizabeth de Clare, a granddaughter of Edward I, which provided for twenty fellows and ten students.'The colleges and halls: Clare College', A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3: The City and University of Cambridge (1959), pp. 340-346. Date Accessed: 2 June 2010 The college was known as Clare Hall until 1856, when it changed its name to \\"Clare College\\". (A new \\"Clare Hall\\" was founded by Clare College as an exclusively postgraduate institution in 1966.) Buildings =Old Court= Old Court from King's Bridge, Cambridge Clare's Old Court, a Grade I listed building, frames King's College Chapel as the left border of one of the most celebrated architectural vistas in England. It was built between 1638 and 1715, with a long interruption for the English Civil War. The period spans the arrival of true classicism into the mainstream of British architecture, such that its progress can be traced in the marked differences between the oldest wing to the north, which still has vaulting and other features in the unbroken tradition of English Gothic, and the final southern block, which shows a fully articulated classic style. The college's chapel was built in 1763 and designed by Sir James Burrough, the Master of neighbouring Caius College. Its altarpiece is Annunciation by Cipriani. Clare College Gate =Clare Bridge= Clare has a much-photographed bridge over the River Cam and is the oldest of Cambridge's current bridges. It was built of stone in 1640 by Thomas Grumbold and restored in 1969, and is a Grade I listed building. Fourteen stone balls decorate it, one of which has a missing section. A number of apocryphal stories circulate concerning this ‚Äì the one most commonly cited by members of college is that the original builder of the bridge was not paid the full amount for his work and so removed the segment to balance the difference in payment. A more likely explanation is that a wedge of stone cemented into the ball as part of a repair job became loose and fell out. =Memorial Court= Clare's bridge connects Old Court to Memorial Court, which was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and dedicated in 1926. Memorial Court was extended in the 1950s by the construction of Thirkill Court, and was later divided into two parts when the College's Forbes Mellon Library was constructed in the centre of Memorial Court; the new courtyard created in the west was renamed Ashby Court. =Lerner Court= A new court, Lerner Court, designed by architects van Heyningen and Haward, was opened in January 2008. It occupies the last piece of undeveloped land in the central area of the College next to Memorial Court and houses a lecture theatre, catering, fellows offices, residential accommodation and a student laundry. =Gallery= File:Clare College, back of Old Court.jpegOld Court in Winter File:Clare Bridge over the River Cam.jpgClare Bridge, over the River Cam File:Clare Bridge - ball with missing wedge.jpgClare Bridge's missing wedge File:Clare College, Cambridge, July 2010 (12).JPGInside the Great Hall File:Clare College, Scholars' Garden.jpgThe Scholars' Garden File:Clare College Chapel, Cambridge.jpgCollege chapel File:Clare College, Cambridge - Lerner Court.jpgLerner Court File:Clare_College_Memorial_Court_02.JPG Memorial Court File:Cambridge boathouses - Clare (2).jpgClare College boathouse File:Antechapel clare.jpgClare college chapel Student life Clare is known as a liberal and progressive college. In 1972 it became one of the three male Cambridge colleges that led the way in admitting female undergraduates (the other two being Churchill and King's). Clare continues in this tradition and has won praise for the transparency of its admissions process. Clare College Bar Clare is known as one of the most musical colleges in Cambridge. Its choir has performed all over the world. Many Clare students play instruments, and the Clare College Music Society, is well known, particularly the orchestra. Like most Cambridge colleges, Clare allows students to have a piano in their college rooms. =Clare Ents= As well as popular jazz and comedy nights, Clare is renowned for Clare Ents, a student night held every Friday in term time. The night is popular with students across the university and in the past it has hosted such acts as Tinie Tempah, Bombay Bicycle Club and Chase and Status. =Clareification= Clare's student newspaper, Clareification, won \\"Best University College Paper\\" in The Cambridge Student in 2005. Published by the Union of Clare Students, it comprises satirical articles mocking Cambridge traditions, reports on silly student antics, and college gossip in the \\"Clareifornication\\" column. On 3 February 2007 the college cut its funding to the paper following the publication of the guest- edited edition of 2 February, retitled Crucification. In addition to the paper's usual satirical attacks on Christianity, this edition also featured several articles which mocked Islam, and a reproduction of the cartoon illustrations of the prophet Mohammed which provoked international protest when they first appeared in Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in September 2005.'' =May Ball= Clare hosts an annual May Ball, during which the college is lavishly decorated. Clare holds an annual may ball on the Monday of May Week in the middle of June. It is one of the largest may balls in Cambridge and is well known for securing popular headliners. =Clare Boat Club= Clare Boat Club is the rowing club for current members of Clare College. There is a separate club, De Burgh Boat Club, for alumni. In 2012, Clare Boat Club had the highest membership relative to the size of its student body of any college-affiliated boat club in Cambridge, fielding six men's VIIIs in the May Bumps competition. The club's Head Coach and Boathouse Manager, Anton Wright, appeared on Channel 4's year-long reality TV show, Eden. =Old Court Panorama= File:Clare_panroama.jpg Academic performance The undergraduates of Clare College have usually performed very well based on the results published in the Tompkins Table, placing Clare within the top ten colleges from 2000 to 2005. However, their performance in the following years (2006‚Äì09) was poorer, leaving them in 12th in 2006 and 18th in 2009. Their 2010 performance (8th position) however showed an increase of 10 places over their previous year's performance, and in 2011 they reached fourth place. In 2018, Clare placed 16th out of 29 colleges recorded in the table. In 2019, it fell to 24th place. Entrance into Clare College is competitive. Overall, Clare has approximately five applicants per place. Yet the high quality of applicants means that many of them are awarded places at other colleges through the Winter Pool.

John III (; 1300 - 5 December 1355) was Duke of Brabant, Lothier, and Limburg (1312-1355).Biographical details can be found in (Alphonse Wauters), Biographie nationale (Acad√©mie royale de Belgique), vol. 10, 1889, s.v. \\"Jean III\\" pp 237-274 He was the son of John II, Duke of Brabant, and Margaret of England. John and the towns of Brabant The early fourteenth century, an economic boom time for Brabant, marks the rise of the Duchy's towns, which depended on English wool for their essential cloth industry. During John's minority, the major towns of Brabant had the authority to appoint councillors to direct a regency, under terms of the Charter of Kortenberg granted by his father in the year of his death (1312). By 1356 his daughter and son-in-law were forced to accept the famous Joyous Entry as a condition for their recognition, so powerful had the States of Brabant become. The marital alignment with France was tested and failed as early as 1316, when Louis X requested Brabant to cease trade with Flanders and to participate in a French attack; the councillors representing the towns found this impossible, and in reprisal Louis prohibited all French trade with Brabant in February 1316, in violation of a treaty of friendship he had signed with Brabant in the previous October. The French alliance, 1332-1337 After his initial period of maintaining independent neutrality from both France and England failed,The following details are drawn from Sergio Boffa, \\"The Duchy of Brabant caught between France and England: geopolitics and diplomacy during the first half of the Hundred Years' War\\", in The Hundred Years War: A Wider Focus, L. J. Andrew Villalon, Donald J. Kagay, eds. vol. I, 2005. neighboring sovereigns in the Low Countries, stimulated as a matter of policy by Philip VI of France, became John's enemies; among the adversaries of John were the Count of Flanders, the prince-bishop of Li√®ge, and counts of Holland and Guelders. In 1332, a crisis with the king of France arose over John's hospitality to Robert, count of Artois, during his journey to eventual asylum at the English court. In response to French pressure John reminded Philip that he did not hold Brabant from him but from God alone.Boffa 2005: 216. A brief campaign of a coalition of Philip's friends came to a truce, followed by a pact at Compi√®gne by which John received a fief from Philip worth 2000 livres and declared himself a vassal of France. His oldest son, Jean, was betrothed to Philip's daughter Marie, and it was agreed that the Braban√ßon heir would complete his education at the French court in Paris and that Robert of Artois would be expelled from Brabant. The support of France strengthened John's hand with his feudal suzerain, the Holy Roman Emperor. Though he was technically the Emperor's feudal vassal, John had been able to ignore Emperor Louis IV's summons to join him in his intended invasion of Lombardy (1327).Boffa 2005:214 The separation of Brabant from the Empire was completed by the Burgundian dukes of Brabant in the fifteenth century. Meanwhile, the princes of the Low Countries settled their differences and formed a coalition against Brabant with a defensive alliance in June 1333. War was briefly brought to the Duchy of Brabant in the summer of 1334, but resolved by a peace brokered by Philip at Amiens. The French king declared that John had to hand over the town of Tiel and its neighbouring villages Heerewaarden and Zandwijk to the count of Guelders and to betroth his daughter Marie to the count's son, Reinoud. The English alliance, 1337-1345 When Edward III of England decided to press his claim to the crown of France in 1337, John, who was his first cousin, became an ally of England during the first stage of the Hundred Years' War. To Edward's diplomatic offensive to draw Brabant away from France, John lent a sympathetic ear.Material in this paragraph is drawn from Boffa 2005:9f.. Disrupting the staple connection between the towns of Flanders and the sources of English wool should divert it to the towns of Brabant, notably the recently established wool exchange. Edward protected Braban√ßon merchants in England from arrest or the confiscation of their goods, and he sweetened his offers with a promise of ¬£60,000, an immense sum, and to make good any losses of revenue that might be confiscated by the king of France. The same month of July 1337 John promised Edward 1200 of his men-at-arms in the event of an English campaign in France, Edward to pay their salary. In August Edward pledged not to negotiate with the king without prior consultation with the duke. The alliance, kept secret at John's insistence, came into the open when Edward landed with his troops at Antwerp July 1338. John received the promised subsidy (March 1339) and agreed in June to betroth John's second daughter, Margaret, to Edward, the Black Prince, heir to the English throne. Two seasons of inconclusive campaigning that ravaged the north of France left Edward penniless at the end of 1341; he returned home, and when he returned to the fray, it was to Brittany: he never returned to the Low Countries. The French alliance, 1345-1355 Though John was requesting papal dispensation for the marriage of Margaret and the Black Prince in 1343, the alliance with England unravelled as Edward's coffers emptied and his attentions turned elsewhere. In September 1345 representative of France and Brabant met at the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye to sign preliminary agreements, and by a treaty signed at Saint-Quentin, June 1347, Brabant was retained as an ally by France. Margaret was now to marry Louis of Male, who had inherited the title of count of Flanders, but whose power against the Flemish communes was virtually nil. A point of dispute with the count of Flanders had been the Lordship of Mechelen, a strategic enclave within Brabant: it was agreed that it would now come under full Braban√ßon control. Despite the diplomacy of Edward, John remained true to his French commitments until his death in December 1355. In 1350, Jews were persecuted in Brabant.  Family  In 1311, as his father's gesture of rapprochement with France, John married Marie d'√âvreux (1303‚Äì1335), the daughter of count Louis d'√âvreux and Margaret of Artois. They had six children: * Joanna, Duchess of Brabant (24 June 1322-1406).

He had a son born from Maria van Huldenberg, who founded the House of Brant: John I Brant, 1st Lord of Ayseau. In 1355, when his two legitimate sons died one right after the other, John was forced to declare his daughter Joanna his heiress,Sergio Boffa, Warfare in Medieval Brabant, 1356-1406, 3. which provoked a succession crisis after his death.

Originally associated with Central European cavalry such as the hussars, the sabre became widespread in Western Europe in the Thirty Years' War. Lighter sabres also became popular with infantry of the late 17th century. In the 19th century, models with less curving blades became common and were also used by heavy cavalry. The last sabre issued to US cavalry was the Patton saber of 1913. Szabla wz. 34 was the last sabre issued to the Polish cavalry, in 1934. The military sabre was used as a duelling weapon in academic fencing in the 19th century, giving rise to a discipline of modern sabre fencing (introduced in the 1896 Summer Olympics) loosely based on the characteristics of the historical weapon in that it allows for cuts as well as thrusts. Name English sabre is recorded from the 1670s, as a direct loan from French, where the sabre is an alteration of sable, which was in turn loaned from German S√§bel, Sabel in the 1630s. The German word is on record from the 15th century, loaned from Polish szabla, which was itself adopted from Hungarian szabla (14th century, later szablya). The spread of the Hungarian word to neighboring European languages took place in the context of the Ottoman wars in Europe of the 15th to 17th centuries. The spelling saber became common in American English in the second half of the 19th century.e.g. Report on the Military Academy at West Point, United States Congressional serial set, Volume 1089, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1861, p. 218. The origin of the Hungarian word is unclear. It may itself be a loan from South Slavic (Serbo-Croatian —Å–∞–±—ô–∞), from a Common Slavic *sablja, which would ultimately derives from a Turkic source.There are some alternative suggestions, deriving the term from a natively Slavic word; e.g. Br√ºckner (S≈Çownik etymologiczny jƒôzyka polskiego. 1927) adduced Slavi sabl \\"rooster\\" and Menges (The Oriental elements in the vocabulary of the oldest Russian epos, 1951) attempted to connect the Arabic saif. In a more recent suggestion, the Hungarian word may ultimately derive from a Tungusic source, via Kipchak Turkic selebe, with later metathesis (of l-b to b-l) and apocope changed to *seble, which would have changed its vocalisation in Hungarian to the recorded sabla (perhaps under the influence of the Hungarian word szab- \\"to crop; cut (into shape)\\".Possible Tungusic cognates include Manchu seleme \\"dagger\\", Evenk s√§l√§m√§ \\"sword\\", argued to be a natively Tungusic formation of sele \\"iron\\" plus a denominal suffix -me by Stachowski (2004). Marek Stachowski, \\"The Origin of the European Word for Sabre\\", Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia 9 (2004), p. 135, citing V. Rybatzki, Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia 7 (2002), p. 115), Menges, Ural-altaische Jahrb√ºcher. Neue Folge 3 (1983), p. 125. History =Origins= Though single-edged cutting swords already existed in the Ancient world, such as the ancient Egyptian and Sumerian sickle swords, these (usually forward instead of backward curving) weapons were chopping weapons for foot soldiers. This type of weapon developed into such heavy chopping weapons as the Greek Machaira and Anatolian Drepanon, and it still survives as the heavy Kukri chopping knife of the Gurkhas. However, in ancient China foot soldiers and cavalry often used a straight, single edged sword, and in the sixth century CE a longer, slightly curved cavalry variety of this weapon appeared in southern Siberia. This \\"proto-sabre\\" (the Turko-Mongol sabre) had developed into the true cavalry sabre by the eight century CE, and by the ninth century, it had become the usual side arm on the Eurasian steppes. The sabre arrived in Europe with the Magyars and the Turkic expansion.Gamber, O. (1978) Waffe und R√ºstung Eurasiens , p. 84, 98, 120, 124, 280Nicolle, D. (2007) Attila and the Nomad Hordes, p. 48Nicolle, D. (1990) Crusader Warfare: Muslims, Mongols and the struggle against the Crusades, p. 175. These oldest sabres had a slight curve, short, down-turned quillons, the grip facing the opposite direction to the blade and a sharp point with the top third of the reverse edge sharpened. =Early modern period= A szabla used by Polish Hussars, 1614 The Sword Dance (1890) by Paja Jovanoviƒá The introduction of the sabre proper in Western Europe, along with the term sabre itself, dates to the 17th century, via the influence of the Eastern European szabla type ultimately derived from these medieval backswords. The adoption of the term is connected to the employment of Hungarian hussar (husz√°r) cavalry by Western armies at the time. Hungarian hussars were employed as light cavalry, with the role of harassing enemy skirmishers, overrunning artillery positions, and pursuing fleeing troops. In the late 17th and 18th centuries, many Hungarian hussars fled to other Central and Western European countries and became the core of light cavalry formations created there.Bavaria raised its first hussar regiment in 1688 and a second one in about 1700. Prussia followed suit in 1721 when Frederick the Great used hussar units extensively during the War of the Austrian Succession. France established a number of hussar regiments from 1692 onward, recruiting originally from Hungary and Germany, then subsequently from German-speaking frontier regions within France itself. The first hussar regiment in France was founded by a Hungarian lieutenant named Ladislas Ignace de Bercheny. Hungarian-history.hu The Hungarian term szablya is ultimately traced to the northwestern Turkic selebe, with contamination from the Hungarian verb szab \\"to cut\\". The original type of sabre, or Polish szabla, was used as a cavalry weapon, possibly inspired by Hungarian or wider Turco- Mongol warfare. The karabela was a type of szabla popular in the late 17th century, worn by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth nobility class, the szlachta. While designed as a cavalry weapon, it also came to replace various types of straight-bladed swords used by infantry.Alaux, Michel. Modern Fencing: Foil, Epee, and Sabre. Scribner's, 1975, p. 123. The Swiss sabre originated as a regular sword with a single-edged blade in the early 16th century, but by the 17th century began to exhibit specialized hilt types. Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth In the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (16th‚Äì18th century) a specific type of sabre-like melee weapon, the szabla, was used. Richly decorated sabres were popular among the Polish nobility, who considered it to be one of the most important pieces of men's traditional attire. With time, the design of the sabre greatly evolved in the commonwealth and gave birth to a variety of sabre-like weapons, intended for many tasks. In the following centuries, the ideology of Sarmatism as well as the Polish fascination with Eastern cultures, customs, cuisine and warfare resulted in the szabla becoming an indispensable part of traditional Polish culture. =Modern use= A British Hussar general with a scabbarded kilij of Turkish manufacture (1812) The briquet, typical infantry sabre of the Napoleonic Wars French Navy sabre of the 19th century, boarding sabre Lieutenant Colonel Te√≥filo Marxuach's M1902 officer's sabre and scabbard at the National Historic Trust site at Castillo San Crist√≥bal in San Juan, Puerto RicoThe sabre saw extensive military use in the early 19th century, particularly in the Napoleonic Wars, during which Napoleon used heavy cavalry charges to great effect against his enemies. Shorter versions of the sabre were also used as sidearms by dismounted units, although these were gradually replaced by fascine knives and sword bayonets as the century went on. Although there was extensive debate over the effectiveness of weapons such as the sabre and lance, the sabre remained the standard weapon of cavalry for mounted action in most armies until World War I and in a few armies until World War II. Thereafter it was gradually relegated to the status of a ceremonial weapon, and most horse cavalry was replaced by armoured cavalry from the 1930s onward. Where horse mounted cavalry survived into World War II it was generally as mounted infantry without sabres. However the sabre was still carried by German cavalry until after the Polish campaign of 1939, after which this historic weapon was put into storage in 1941. Romanian cavalry continued to carry their straight \\"thrusting\\" sabres on active service until at least 1941.Klaus Richter, Weapons & Equipment of the German Cavalry: 1935-1945, p. 25, Napoleonic era Sabres were commonly used by the British in the Napoleonic era for light cavalry and infantry officers, as well as others. The elegant but effective 1803 pattern sword that the British Government authorized for use by infantry officers during the wars against Napoleon featured a curved sabre blade which was often blued and engraved by the owner in accordance with his personal taste, and was based on the famously agile 1796 light cavalry sabre that was renowned for its brutal cutting power. Sabres were commonly used throughout this era by all armies, in much the same way that the British did. The popularity of the sabre had rapidly increased in Britain throughout the 18th century for both infantry and cavalry use. This influence was predominately from southern and eastern Europe, with the Hungarians and Austrians listed as sources of influence for the sword and style of swordsmanship in British sources. The popularity of sabres had spread rapidly through Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, and finally came to dominance as a military weapon in the British army in the 18th century, though straight blades remained in use by some, such as heavy cavalry units. (These were also replaced by sabres soon after the Napoleonic era). The introduction of 'pattern' swords in the British army in 1788 led to a brief departure from the sabre in infantry use (though not for light cavalry), in favour of the lighter and straight bladed spadroon. The spadroon was universally unpopular, and many officers began to unofficially purchase and carry sabres once more. In 1799, the army accepted this under regulation for some units, and in 1803, produced a dedicated pattern of sabre for certain infantry officers (flank, rifle and staff officers). The 1803 pattern quickly saw much more widespread use than the regulation intended due to its effectiveness in combat, and fashionable appeal. Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre The most famous British sabre of the Napoleonic era is the 1796 light cavalry model, used by troopers and officers alike (officers versions can vary a little, but are much the same as the pattern troopers sword) It was in part designed by the famous John Le Marchant, who worked to improve on the previous (1788) design based on his experience with the Austrians and Hungarians. Le Marchant also developed the first official British military sword exercise manual based on this experience, and his light cavalry sabre, and style of swordsmanship went on to heavily influence the training of the infantry and the navy. The 1796 light cavalry sword was known for its brutal cutting power, easily severing limbs, and leading to the (unsubstantiated) myth that the French put in an official complaint to the British about its ferocity. This sword also saw widespread use with mounted artillery units, and the numerous militia units established in Britain to protect against a potential invasion by Napoleon. Mameluke swords Though the sabre had already become very popular in Britain, experience in Egypt did lead to a fashion trend for mameluke sword style blades, a type of Middle Eastern scimitar, by some infantry and cavalry officers. These blades differ from the more typical British ones in that they have more extreme curvatures, in that they are usually not fullered, and in that they taper to a finer point. Mameluke swords also gained some popularity in France as well. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, himself carried a mameluke-style sword. In 1831, the 'Mameluke' sword became the pattern sword for British generals, as well as officers of the United States Marine Corps; in this last capacity, it is still in such use at the present time. United States The American victory over the rebellious forces in the citadel of Tripoli in 1805, during the First Barbary War, led to the presentation of bejewelled examples of these swords to the senior officers of the US Marines. Officers of the US Marine Corps still use a mameluke-pattern dress sword. Although some genuine Turkish kilij sabres were used by Westerners, most \\"mameluke sabres\\" were manufactured in Europe; although their hilts were very similar in form to the Ottoman prototype, their blades, even when an expanded ' was incorporated, tended to be longer, narrower and less curved than those of the true kilij. In the American Civil War, the sabre was used infrequently as a weapon, but saw notable deployment in the Battle of Brandy Station and at East Cavalry Field at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Many cavalrymen‚Äîparticularly on the Confederate side‚Äîeventually abandoned the long, heavy weapons in favour of revolvers and carbines. The last sabre issued to US cavalry was the Patton saber of 1913, designed to be mounted to the cavalryman's saddle. The Patton saber is only a saber on name. It is a straight, thrust-centric sword. A US War Department circular dated 18 April 1934 announced that the saber would no longer be issued to cavalry, and that it was to be completely discarded for use as a weapon. Only dress sabers, for use by officers only, and strictly as a badge of rank, were to be retained.Randy Staffen, pages=76‚Äì77 \\"The Horse Soldier 1776‚Äì1943, Volume IV\\", UE443.S83, University of Oklahoma 1979 Police During the 19th and into the early 20th century, sabres were also used by both mounted and dismounted personnel in some European police forces. When the sabre was used by mounted police against crowds, the results could be devastating, as portrayed in a key scene in Doctor Zhivago. The sabre was later phased out in favour of the baton, or nightstick, for both practical and humanitarian reasons. The Gendarmerie of Belgium used them until at least 1950, and the Swedish police forces until 1965. Contemporary dress uniform Swords with sabre blades remain a component of the dress uniforms worn by most national army, navy, air force, marine and coast guard officers. Some militaries also issue ceremonial swords to their highest-ranking non-commissioned officers; this is seen as an honour since, typically, non-commissioned, enlisted/other-rank military service members are instead issued a cutlass blade rather than a sabre. Swords in the modern military are no longer used as weapons, and serve only ornamental or ceremonial functions. One distinctive modern use of sabres is in the sabre arch, performed for servicemen or women getting married. Modern sport fencing The modern fencing sabre bears little resemblance to the cavalry sabre, having a thin, long straight blade. Rather, it is based upon the Italian dueling saber of classical fencing. One of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing, it is a very fast-paced weapon with bouts characterized by quick footwork and cutting with the edge. The only allowed target area is from the waist up ‚Äì the region a mounted man could reach on a foe on the ground. The concept of attacking above the waist only is a 20th- century change to the sport; previously sabreurs used to pad their legs against cutting slashes from their opponents. The reason for the above waist rule is unknown,J. Christoph Amberger, The Secret History of the Sword, 1996 Hammerterz Forum, revised edition 1999 Multi-media Books, Inc. as the sport of sabre fencing is based on the use of infantry sabres, not cavalry sabres.

A backsword is a type of sword characterised by having a single-edged blade and a hilt with a single-handed grip. It is so called because the triangular cross section gives a flat back edge opposite the cutting edge. Later examples often have a \\"false edge\\" on the back near the tip, which was in many cases sharpened to make an actual edge and facilitate thrusting attacks. From around the early 14th century the backsword became the first type of European sword to be fitted with a knuckle guard. The term \\"backsword\\" can also refer to the singlestick, which is used to train for fighting with the backsword, or to the sport or art of fighting in this fashion. Being easier and cheaper to make than double-edged swords, backswords became the favored sidearm of common infantry, including irregulars such as the Highland Scots, which in Scottish Gaelic were called the claidheamh cuil (back sword), after one of several terms for the distinct types of weapons they used. Backswords were often the secondary weapons of European cavalrymen beginning in the 17th century.

Early life Henry was possibly born in Leuven (Louvain), the son of Count Godfrey III of Louvain and his wife Margaret, daughter of Duke Henry II of Limburg. His father also held the title of a landgrave of Brabant, duke of Lower Lorraine and margrave of Antwerp. Henry early appeared as a co-ruler of his father. In 1179 he married Matilda of Boulogne, daughter of Marie of Boulogne and Matthew of Alsace and on this occasion received the County of Brussels from his father. He acted as a regent while Count Godfrey III went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem from 1182 to 1184. Career In 1183 Henry took the title of duke of Brabant. Upon the death of his father in 1190, King Henry VI confirmed the elevation of Brabant, while he de facto abolished the Duchy of Lower Lorraine by creating the empty title of a Duke of Lothier. Duke Henry sought to expand his power and soon picked several quarrels with the Count Baldwin V of Hainaut. He also was in opposition to the German king (emperor from 1191) when his brother Albert of Louvain was elected bishop of Li√®ge and murdered shortly afterwards. Further conflicts with Duke Henry III of Limburg and Count Otto I of Guelders followed, before in mid-1197 Henry of Brabant joined the Crusade of Henry VI as one of the leaders. In October of the same year he took part in the recapture of Beirut and, then moved to Jaffa with the crusaders: however, before reaching the city he got news of the death of the King of Jerusalem, Henry II, Count of Champagne, and he returned to Acre. Here he acted as regent until the arrival of the new king, Amalric II. Back in Germany after the emperor's death in September 1197, Duke Henry supported the election of the Welf candidate Otto IV, the fianc√© of his daughter Maria, who rivalled with the Hohenstaufen scion Philip of Swabia. He fought against Philip's seconders Count Dirk VII of Holland and Count Otto of Guelders, however, he switched sides in 1204, when he and King Philip II of France backed Philip against Otto. In 1208, after the assassination of Philip, Henry was proposed as successor by King Philip II. In the war which followed, he finally reached a reconciliation with Emperor Otto IV. Together they fought against King Philip in the 1214 Battle of Bouvines, but the two were defeated. In 1213, Duke Henry also suffered a heavy defeat against the Bishopric of Li√®ge in the Battle of Steppes. From 1217 to 1218 he joined the Fifth Crusade to Egypt. Grave of duke Henry Under Henry I, there was town policy and town planning. His attention went out to those regions that lent themselves to the extension of his sovereignty and in some locations he used the creation of a new town as an instrument in the political organisation of the area. Among the towns to which the duke gave city rights and trade privileges was 's-Hertogenbosch. In 1234, he participated in the Stedinger Crusade. In 1235 Emperor Frederick II appointed Henry to travel to England to bring him his fianc√©e Isabella, daughter of King John of England. Henry fell ill on his way back and died at Cologne. He was buried in St. Peter's Church at Leuven where his Late Romanesque effigy can still be seen.

Humans expel feces with a frequency varying from a few times daily to a few times weekly. Waves of muscular contraction (known as peristalsis) in the walls of the colon move fecal matter through the digestive tract towards the rectum. Undigested food may also be expelled this way, in a process called egestion. Open defecation, the practice of defecating outside without using a toilet of any kind, is still widespread in some developing countries.WHO and UNICEF (2017) Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF), 2017 Description Cattle defecating =Physiology= The rectum ampulla stores fecal waste (also called stool, or poo) before it is excreted. As the waste fills the rectum and expands the rectal walls, stretch receptors in the rectal walls stimulate the desire to defecate. This urge to defecate arises from the reflex contraction of rectal muscles, relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, and an initial contraction of the skeletal muscle of the external anal sphincter. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon by reverse peristalsis, where more water is absorbed and the faeces is stored until the next mass peristaltic movement of the transverse and descending colon. When the rectum is full, an increase in pressure within the rectum forces apart the walls of the anal canal, allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves push the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external anal sphincters along with the puborectalis muscle allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces. =Voluntary and involuntary control= Defecation may be involuntary or voluntary. Young children learn voluntary control through the process of toilet training. Once trained, loss of control, called fecal incontinence, may be caused by physical injury, nerve injury, prior surgeries (such as an episiotomy), constipation, diarrhea, loss of storage capacity in the rectum, intense fright, inflammatory bowel disease, psychological or neurological factors, childbirth, or death. Sometimes, due to the inability to control one's bowel movement or due to excessive fear, defecation (usually accompanied by urination) occurs involuntarily, soiling a person's undergarments. This may cause significant embarrassment to the person if this occurs in the presence of other people or in a public place. =Posture= The positions and modalities of defecation are culture-dependent. Squat toilets are used by the vast majority of the world, including most of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The use of sit-down toilets in the Western world is a relatively recent development, beginning in the 19th century with the advent of indoor plumbing. Disease Regular bowel movements determine the functionality and the health of the alimentary tracts in human body. Defecation is the most common regular bowel movement which eliminates waste from the human body. The frequency of defecation is hard to identify, which can vary from daily to weekly depending on individual bowel habits, the impact from the environment and genetic. . If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period the fecal matter may harden, resulting in constipation. If defecation occurs too fast, before excess liquid is absorbed, diarrhea may occur. Other associated symptoms can include abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. Disorders of the bowel can seriously impact quality of life and daily activities. The causes of functional bowel disorder are multifactorial, and dietary habits such as food intolerance and low fibre diet are considered to be the primary factors. = Constipation = Constipation, also known as defecatory dysfunction, is the difficulty experienced when passing stools. It is one of the most notable alimentary disorders that affects different age groups in the population. The common constipation is associated with abdominal distention, pain or bloating. Researches revealed that the chronic constipation complied with higher risk of cardiovascular events such as 'coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke', while associating with an increasing risk of mortality. Besides the dietary factors, the psychological traumas and 'pelvic floor disorders' can also cause the chronic constipation and defecatory disorder respectively. Multiple interventions, including physical activities, 'high-fibre diet', probiotics and drug therapies can be widely and efficiently used to treat constipation and defecatory disorder. = Inflammatory bowel diseases = Inflammatory disease is characterized as a long-lasting chronic inflammatory throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two universal type of inflammatory bowel diseases that have been studied over a century, and they are closely related to different environmental risk factors, family genetic and people's lifestyle such that smoking is considered highly associated with these diseases. Crohn's disease is discovered to be related to immune disorders particularly . Different level of cumulative intestinal injuries can cause different complications, such as 'fistulae, damage of bowel function and symptoms reoccur, disability' etc. The patient group can vary from children to adults. The newest research revealed that immunodeficiency and monogenic are the causes of young patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. The onset rate keeps updating each year with dramatically increased number and the pathogen of the bowel disease are also complicated due to the complexity of the bowel organs, bowel diseases are diverse in terms of the small and big bowel. Common symptoms for inflammatory bowel diseases differ by the infection level, but may include severe abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fatigue and unexpected weight loss. Crohn's disease can lead to infection of any part of the digestive tract, including ileum to anus. Internal manifestations include diarrhoea, abdomen pain, fever, chronic anaemia etc. External manifestations include impact on skin, joints, eyes and liver. Significantly reduced 'microbat diversity' inside the gastrointestinal tract can also be observed. Ulcerative colitis mainly affects the function of the large bowel, and its incidence rate is three times larger than the Crohn's disease. In terms of clinical features, over 90% of patients exhibited constant diarrhoea, 'rectal bleeding, softer and mucus in the stool, tenesmus and abdomen pain'. At the same time, patient also reported to be having 'arthralgia, episcleritis and erythema nodosum'. The symptoms can continue for around 6 weeks or even more than that. The inflammatory bowel diseases could be effectively treated by 'pharmacotherapies' to relieve and maintain the symptoms, which showed in 'mucosal healing' and symptoms elimination. However, an optimal therapy for curing both inflammatory diseases are still under research due to the heterogeneity in clinical feature. Although both UC and CD are sharing similar symptoms, the medical treatment of them are distinctively different. Dietary treatment can benefit for curing CD by increase the dietary zinc and fish intake, which is related to mucosal healing of the bowel. Treatments vary from drug treatment to surgery based on the active level of the CD. UC can also be relieved by using immunosuppressive therapy for mild to moderate disease level and application of biological agents for severe cases. =Irritable bowel syndrome= Irritable bowel syndrome is diagnosed as an intestinal disorder with chronic abdominal pain and inconsistency form of stool, and it is a common bowel disease that can be easily diagnosed in modern society. The variety of incident rate is acceptable due to the different diagnostic criteria in different countries, the 18‚Äì34 age group is recognized as the high frequency incident group. The definite cause of the irritable bowel syndrome is remaining a mystery, however, it has been founded relating to multifactor, such as 'alternation of mood and pressure, sleep disorders, food triggers, changing of dysbiosis and even sexual disfunction'. One third of irritable bowel syndrome patients has family history with the disease suggesting that genetic predisposition could be a significant cause for irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome are commonly experiencing abdomen pain, changing in stool form, reoccur abdomen bloating and gas, co-morbid disorders and alternation in bowel habits that caused diarrhea or constipation. However, anxiety and tension can also be detected, although patients with irritable bowel disease seems healthy. Apart from these typical symptoms, rectal bleeding, unexpected weight loss and increased inflammatory markers are required further medical examination and investigation. The treatment for irritable bowel diseases is multimodal. Dietary interference and pharmacotherapies both can relieve the symptoms to a certain degree. Avoiding trigger or allergy food group can be beneficial by reducing fermentation in the digestive tract and gas production, hence effectively alleviate abdominal pain and bloating. Drug interventions, such as laxatives, loperamide, and lubiprostone are applied to relieve intense symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain and constipation. Psychological treatment, dietary supplements and gut-focused hypnotherapy are recommended for targeting depression, mood disorders and sleep disturbance. = Bowel obstruction = Bowel obstruction is a bowel condition which is a blockage that can be found in both the small intestines and large intestines. The increase of contractions can relief blockages, however, the continuous contraction with deceasing functionality may lead to terminated mobility of the small intestines, which then forms the obstruction. At the same time, the lack of the contractility encourages liquid and gas accumulation.and 'electrolyte disturbances'. The small bowel obstruction can result in severe renal damage and hypovolemia. while evolving into 'mucosal ischemia and perforation'. Patients with small bowel obstruction were found experiencing constipation, strangulation and abdominal pain and vomiting. Surgery intervention is primarily used to cure severe small bowel obstruction condition. Nonoperative therapy included ‚Äònasogastric tube decompression', 'water-soluble-contrast medium process' or symptomatic management can be applied to treat less severe symptoms According to research, large bowel obstruction is less common than small bowel obstruction, but is still associated with high mortality rate. Large bowel obstruction also known as colonic obstruction include acute colonic obstruction where a blockage is formed in the colon. Colonic obstructions frequently happen within elder population, often accompanied with significant 'comorbidities'. Although colonic malignancy is revealed as the major cause of the colonic obstruction, 'volvulus' has also been founded as a secondary common cause around the world. On top of that, lower mobility, unhealthy mentality and restricted living environment are also listed as the risk factors. Surgery and colonic stent placements are widely applied for curing colonic obstructions. =Other= Attempting forced expiration of breath against a closed airway (the valsalva maneuver) is sometimes practiced to induce defecation while on a toilet. This contraction of expiratory chest muscles, diaphragm, abdominal wall muscles, and pelvic diaphragm exerts pressure on the digestive tract. Ventilation at this point temporarily ceases as the lungs push the chest diaphragm down to exert the pressure. Cardiac arrest and other cardiovascular complications can in rare cases occur due to attempting to defecate using the valsalva maneuver. Valsalva retinopathy is another pathological syndrome associated with the Valsalva maneuver. Thoracic blood pressure rises and as a reflex response the amount of blood pumped by the heart decreases. Death has been known to occur in cases where defecation causes the blood pressure to rise enough to cause the rupture of an aneurysm or to dislodge blood clots (see thrombosis). Also, in releasing the Valsalva maneuver blood pressure falls; this, coupled with standing up quickly to leave the toilet, can result in a blackout.  Society and culture  =Open defecation= Open defecation is the human practice of defecating outside (in the open environment) rather than into a toilet. People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals or other open space for defecation. They do so because either they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices. The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets. Open defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality, poor nutrition, poverty, and large disparities between rich and poor. Ending open defecation is an indicator being used to measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6. Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating open defecation is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty. = Anal cleansing after defecation = The anus and buttocks may be cleansed after defecation with toilet paper, similar paper products, or other absorbent material. In many cultures, such as Hindu and Muslim, water is used for anal cleansing after defecation, either in addition to using toilet paper or exclusively. When water is used for anal cleansing after defecation, toilet paper may be used for drying the area afterwards. Some doctors and people who work in the science and hygiene fields have stated that switching to using a bidet as a form of anal cleansing after defecation is both more hygienic and more environmentally friendly. = Mythology and tradition = The caganer is a defecating figurine in Spanish nativity scenes Some peoples have culturally significant stories in which defecation plays a role. For example: *In an Alune and Wemale legend from the island of Seram, Maluku Province, Indonesia, the mythical girl Hainuwele defecates valuable objects. *One of the traditions of Catalonia (Spain) relates to the caganer, a figurine depicting the act of defecation which appears in nativity scenes in Catalonia and neighbouring areas with Catalan culture. The exact origin of the caganer is lost, but the tradition has existed since at least the 18th century.

The plot derives from William Shakespeare's King Lear and includes segments based on legends of the daimy≈ç M≈çri Motonari. The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons. The film is a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa began using it only after he had started pre-planning for Ran. Following this pre-planning, Kurosawa filmed Dersu Uzala in 1975 followed by Kagemusha in the early 1980s before securing financial backing to film Ran. Ran was Kurosawa's second encounter with Shakespeare during his filmmaking career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed based on Shakespeare's Macbeth. Despite the changes in setting and language, both Ran and Throne of Blood received critical acclaim. As Kurosawa's last epic, Ran has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. With a budget of $11 million, it was the most expensive Japanese film produced up to that time. Ran was previewed on May 31, 1985, at the Tokyo International Film Festival before its release on June 1, 1985, in Japan. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of color‚Äìcostume designer Emi Wada won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design for her work on Ran. The distinctive Gustav Mahler‚Äìinspired film score was composed by Toru Takemitsu. Plot Hidetora Ichimonji, a powerful though now elderly warlord, decides to divide his kingdom among his three sons: Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. Taro, the eldest, will receive the prestigious First Castle and become leader of the Ichimonji clan, while Jiro and Saburo will be given the Second and Third Castles. Hidetora is to retain the title of Great Lord and Jiro and Saburo are to support Taro. Hidetora begins to lecture his sons about the importance of unity using three arrows. He selects one arrow out of a quiver and shows how easy it is to snap in half but three arrows bundled together are much more durable. Saburo, however, breaks all three arrows with his knee and calls the lecture foolish. He points out that Hidetora is foolish if he expects his sons to be loyal to him, reminding him that even Hidetora had previously used the most ruthless methods to attain power. Hidetora hears the comments as being subversive, and when his servant Tango comes to Saburo's defense, he exiles both men. Fujimaki, a visiting warlord who had witnessed these events agrees with Saburo's frankness, and invites him to take his daughter's hand in marriage. Following the division of Hidetora's lands between his remaining two sons, Taro's wife Lady Kaede begins to urge her husband to usurp control of the entire Ichimonji clan. She is still bitter about the loss of her family; Hidetora's army had previously killed her family after a land dispute and then assimilated the family's lands. When Taro demands Hidetora renounce his title of Great Lord, Hidetora then storms out of the castle and travels to Jiro's castle, only to discover that Jiro is only interested in using Hidetora as a titular pawn. Hidetora and his retinue then leave Jiro's castle as well without any clear destination. Eventually Tango appears with provisions but to no avail. Tango then tells Hidetora of Taro's new decree: death to whoever aids his father. At last Hidetora takes refuge in the Third Castle, abandoned after Saburo's forces followed their lord into exile. Tango does not follow him. Kyoami, the court fool, then jokes about Hidetora's predicament, only to be thrown out of the Third Castle. Shortly thereafter, Hidetora and his samurai retinue are besieged militarily by Taro and Jiro's combined forces. As Taro and Jiro's forces storm the castle, Taro is killed by a bullet fired by Jiro's general, Kurogane. In a short but violent siege, Hidetora's defenders are slaughtered and the Third Castle is destroyed by fire. Hidetora is allowed to survive though without any supplies or bodyguards and he succumbs to madness after wandering away from the decimated castle. Hidetora is discovered wandering in the wilderness by Kyoami and Tango, who are still loyal to him, and stay to assist Hidetora. In his madness, Hidetora is haunted by horrific visions of the people he destroyed in his quest for power. They take refuge in a peasant's home only to discover that the occupant is Tsurumaru, the brother of Lady Su√©, Jiro's wife. Tsurumaru had been blinded and left impoverished after Hidetora took over his land and killed his father, a rival lord. With Taro dead, Jiro becomes the Great Lord of the Ichimonji clan, enabling him to move into the First Castle. Upon Jiro's return from battle, Lady Kaede, seemingly unfazed by Taro's death, manipulates Jiro into having an affair with her, and undermines Jiro's power from behind his throne. Kaede demands that Jiro kill Lady Su√© and marry her instead. Jiro orders Kurogane to do the deed, but he refuses, seeing through Kaede's perfidy. Kurogane then warns Su√© and Tsurumaru to flee. Tango, still watching over Hidetora with Kyoami, encounters Ikoma and Ogura, who had once served as spies for Jiro, betraying Hidetora and Taro only to be exiled. Before he kills them both for their treason, Ikoma tells him that Jiro is considering sending assassins after Hidetora. Alarmed, Tango rides off to alert Saburo. Hidetora becomes even more insane and runs off into a volcanic plain with a frantic Kyoami in pursuit. Saburo's army crosses back into Jiro's territory to find him. News also reaches Jiro that two rival lords allied to Saburo (Ayabe and Fujimaki) have also entered the territory and Jiro hastily mobilizes his army. At the field of battle, the two brothers accept a truce, but Saburo becomes alarmed when Kyoami arrives to tell of his father's descent into madness. Saburo goes with Kyoami to rescue his father and takes ten warriors with him; Jiro sends several gunners to follow Saburo, offering a bounty for whoever kills him and Hidetora. Lady Kaede has already convinced Jiro to send another group of assassins to hunt down Su√© and Tsurumaru. Jiro then further orders an attack on Saburo's much smaller force and Saburo's army retreats into the woods. Jiro attempts to pursue Saburo's army in the forest but is stopped short with significant losses due to the deadly muskets wielded by Saburo's infantry. In the middle of the battle a messenger arrives with news that the rival warlord, Ayabe, is marching on the First Castle, forcing Jiro's army to hastily retreat. Saburo finds Hidetora in the volcanic plain; Hidetora partially recovers his sanity, and begins repairing his relationship with Saburo. However, one of the snipers Jiro had sent after Saburo's small group shoots and kills Saburo. Overcome with grief, Hidetora dies. Fujimaki and his army arrive from their victory only to witness Tango and Kyoami lamenting the death of father and son. Meanwhile, Tsurumaru and Su√© arrive at the ruins of a destroyed castle but inadvertently leave behind the flute that Su√© previously gave Tsurumaru when he was banished. She gives a picture of Amida Buddha to him for company while she attempts to retrieve the missing flute. It is when she returns to Tsurumaru's hovel to retrieve it that she is ambushed and killed by Jiro's assassins. At the same time, Ayabe's army pursues Jiro's army to the First Castle and commences a siege. When Kurogane hears that Lady Su√© has been murdered by one of Jiro's men, he confronts Kaede. She admits her perfidy and her plots to exact revenge against Hidetora and the Ichimonji clan for having destroyed her family years before. Enraged, Kurogane kills Kaede. Jiro, Kurogane, and all Jiro's men subsequently die in the battle with Ayabe's army that follows. A solemn funeral procession is held for Saburo and Hidetora. Meanwhile, left alone in the castle ruins, Tsurumaru trips, dropping the Amida Buddha image Su√© had given to him. The film ends with a distance shot of Tsurumaru, blind and alone, silhouetted against the castle's landscape atop the ruins.

Production Prior to filming, Kurosawa spent ten years storyboarding every shot in the film as paintings. This is the Third Castle upon Hidetora's arrival. Ran was Kurosawa's last epic film and by far his most expensive. At the time, its budget of $11 million made it the most expensive Japanese film in history leading to its distribution in 1985 exceeding the budget of 7.5 million dollars for his previous film Kagemusha. It is a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films and Greenwich Film Productions. Filming started in 1983. The 1,400 uniforms and suits of armor used for the extras were designed by costume designer Emi Wada and Kurosawa, and were handmade by master tailors over more than two years. The film also used 200 horses. Kurosawa loved filming in lush and expansive locations, and most of Ran was shot amidst the mountains and plains of Mount Aso, Japan's largest active volcano. Kurosawa was granted permission to shoot at two of the country's most famous landmarks, the ancient castles at Kumamoto and Himeji. For the castle of Lady Su√©'s family, he used the ruins of the custom-constructed Azusa castle, made by Kurosawa's production crew near Mount Fuji.MTV News, \\"Happy 444th Birthday, William Shakespeare, Screenwriter\\", Mark Bourne, 04/22/2008, .Soundtrack of Ran. Azusa Castle listed as individual track on soundtrack release . Hidetora's third castle, which was burned to the ground, was a real building which Kurosawa built on the slopes of Mount Fuji. No miniatures were used for that segment, and Tatsuya Nakadai had to do the scene where Hidetora flees the castle in one take. Kurosawa also filmed a scene that required an entire field to be sprayed gold, but cut it out of the final film during editing. The documentary A.K. shows the filming of the scene. Kurosawa often shot scenes with three cameras simultaneously, each using different lenses and angles. Many long-shots were employed and very few close-ups. On several occasions Kurosawa used static cameras and suddenly brought the action into frame, rather than using the camera to track the action. He also used jump cuts to progress certain scenes, changing the pace of the action for filmic effect. Akira Kurosawa's wife of 39 years, Y≈çko Yaguchi, died during the production of the film. He halted filming for one day to mourn before resuming work. His regular recording engineer Fumio Yanoguchi also died late in production in January 1985. =Development= Kurosawa conceived of the idea that became Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read a parable about the Sengoku-period warlord M≈çri Motonari. Motonari was famous for having three sons, all incredibly loyal and talented. Kurosawa began imagining what would have happened had they been bad. Although the film eventually became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa became aware of the play only after he had started pre- planning. According to him, the stories of M≈çri Motonari and Lear merged in a way he was never fully able to explain. He wrote the script shortly after filming Dersu Uzala in 1975, and then \\"let it sleep\\" for seven years. During this time, he painted storyboards of every shot in the film (later included with the screenplay and available on the Criterion Collection DVD release) and then continued searching for funding. Following his success with 1980's Kagemusha, which he sometimes called a \\"dress rehearsal\\" for Ran, Kurosawa was finally able to secure backing from French producer Serge Silberman. Kurosawa once said \\"Hidetora is me\\", and there is evidence in the film that Hidetora serves as a stand-in for Kurosawa. Roger Ebert agrees, arguing that Ran \\"may be as much about Kurosawa's life as Shakespeare's play\\". Ran was the final film of Kurosawa's \\"third period\\" (1965‚Äì1985), a time where he had difficulty securing support for his pictures, and was frequently forced to seek foreign financial backing. While he had directed over twenty films in the first two decades of his career, he directed just four in these two decades. After directing Red Beard (1965), Kurosawa discovered that he was considered old- fashioned and did not work again for almost five years. He also found himself competing against television, which had reduced Japanese film audiences from a high of 1.1 billion in 1958 to under 200 million by 1975. In 1968 he was fired from the 20th Century Fox epic Tora! Tora! Tora! over what he described as creative differences, but others said was a perfectionism that bordered on insanity. Kurosawa tried to start an independent production group with three other directors, but his 1970 film Dodes'ka-den was a box-office flop and bankrupted the company. Many of his younger rivals boasted that he was finished. A year later, unable to secure any domestic funding and plagued by ill-health, Kurosawa attempted suicide by slashing his wrists. Though he survived, his misfortune continued to plague him until the late 1980s. King Lear and the Fool in the Storm by William Dyce Kurosawa was influenced by the William Shakespeare play King Lear and borrowed elements from it. Both depict an aging warlord who decides to divide up his kingdom among his children. Hidetora has three sons‚ÄîTaro, Jiro, and Saburo‚Äîwho correspond to Lear's daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. In both, the warlord foolishly banishes anyone who disagrees with him as a matter of pride‚Äîin Lear it is the Earl of Kent and Cordelia; in Ran it is Tango and Saburo. The conflict in both is that two of the lord's children ultimately turn against him, while the third supports him, though Hidetora's sons are far more ruthless than Goneril and Regan. Both King Lear and Ran end with the death of the entire family, including the lord. There are some crucial differences between the two stories. King Lear is a play about undeserved suffering, and Lear himself is at worst a fool. Hidetora, by contrast, has been a cruel warrior for most of his life: a man who ruthlessly murdered men, women, and children to achieve his goals. In Ran, Lady Kaede, Lady Su√©, and Tsurumaru were all victims of Hidetora. Whereas in King Lear the character of Gloucester had his eyes gouged out by Lear's enemies, in Ran it was Hidetora himself who gave the order to blind Tsurumaru. The role of the Fool has been expanded into a major character (Kyoami), and Lady Kaede serves as the equivalent of Goneril, but is given a more complex and important character.Kurosawa's RAN. Jim's Reviews. Kurosawa was concerned that Shakespeare gave his characters no past, and he wanted to give his version of King Lear a history. The complex and variant etymology for the word Ran used as the title has been variously translated as \\"chaos\\", \\"rebellion\\", or \\"revolt\\"; or to mean \\"disturbed\\" or \\"confused\\". =Filming= The filming of Ran began in 1983. The development and conception of the filming of the war scenes in the film were influenced by Kurosawa's opinions on nuclear warfare. According to Michael Wilmington, Kurosawa told him that much of the film was a metaphor for nuclear warfare and the anxiety of the post-Hiroshima age. He believed that, despite all of the technological progress of the 20th century, all people had learned was how to kill each other more efficiently. In Ran, the vehicle for apocalyptic destruction is the arquebus, an early firearm that was introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Arquebuses revolutionized samurai warfare. Kurosawa had already dealt with this theme in his previous film Kagemusha, in which the Takeda cavalry is destroyed by the arquebuses of the Oda and Tokugawa clans. In Ran, the battle of Hachiman Field is an illustration of this new kind of warfare. Saburo's arquebusiers annihilate Jiro's cavalry and drive off his infantry by engaging them from the woods, where the cavalry are unable to venture. Similarly, Taro and Saburo's assassination by a sniper also shows how individual heroes can be easily disposed of on a modern battlefield. Kurosawa also illustrates this new warfare with his camera. Instead of focusing on the warring armies, he frequently sets the focal plane beyond the action, so that in the film they appear as abstract entities. =Casting= The description of Hidetora in the first script was originally based on Toshiro Mifune. However, the role was cast to Tatsuya Nakadai, an actor who had played several supporting and major characters in previous Kurosawa films, such as Shingen and his double in Kagemusha. Other Kurosawa veterans in Ran were Masayuki Yui (Tango), Jinpachi Nezu (Jiro) and Daisuke Ryu (Saburo), all of whom were in Kagemusha. Other veteran Kurosawa actors did not appear in Ran, but would go on to work with Kurosawa again, such as Akira Terao (Taro) and Mieko Harada (Lady Kaede) in Dreams, and Hisashi Igawa (Kurogane) in both Dreams and Rhapsody in August. Kurosawa also hired two comedians for lighter moments: Shinnosuke \\"Peter\\" Ikehata as Hidetora's fool Kyoami and Hitoshi Ueki as rival warlord Nobuhiro Fujimaki. About 1,400 extras were employed. =Acting style= While most of the characters in Ran are portrayed by conventional acting techniques, two performances are reminiscent of Japanese Noh theater. Noh is a specialized form of Japanese traditional theater requiring highly trained actors and musicians where emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures. The heavy, ghost-like makeup worn by Tatsuya Nakadai's character, Hidetora, resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh performers. The body language exhibited by the same character is also typical of Noh theater: long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. The character of Lady Kaede is also Noh-influenced. The Noh treatment emphasizes the ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures of these two characters. = Music = Craig Lysy, writing for Movie Music UK, commented on the strengths of the film soundtrack's composer for Kurosawa's purposes: \\"T≈çru Takemitsu was Japan's preeminent film score composer and Kurosawa secured his involvement in 1976, during the project's early stages. Their initial conception of the score was to use tategoe, a 'shrill-voice' chant style without instrumentation. Over the intervening years Kurosawa's conception of the score changed dramatically. As they began production his desire had changed 180 degrees, now insisting on a powerful Mahleresque orchestral score. Takemitsu responded with what many describe as his most romantic effort, one that achieved a perfect blending of Oriental and Occidental sensibilities.\\" Takemitsu has stated that he was significantly influenced by the Japanese karmic concept of ma interpreted as a surplus of energy surrounding an abundant void. As Lysy stated: \\"Takemitsu was guided in his efforts best summed up in the Japanese word ma, which suggests the incongruity of a void abounding with energy. He related: 'My music is like a garden, and I am the gardener. Listening to my music can be compared with walking through a garden and experiencing the changes in light, pattern and texture. The project was the second of two which allowed Kurosawa and Takemitsu to collaborate during their lifetimes, the first being Dodes'ka-den in 1970. Lysy summarized the second project stating: \\"the collaboration between Kurosawa and the temperamental Takemitsu was rocky. Kurosawa constantly sent Takemitsu notes, which only served to infuriate him, so he frequently visited the set to gain a direct sensual experience. Takemitsu actually resigned... Fortunately producer Masato Hara intervened, made peace, and Takemitsu returned to the film. Years later Takemitsu would relate: \\"Overall, I still have this feeling of ... 'Oh, if only he'd left more up to me' ... But seeing it now ... I guess it's fine the way it is. Kurosawa originally had wanted the London Symphony Orchestra to perform the score for Ran, but upon meeting conductor Hiroyuki Iwaki of the Sapporo Symphony Orchestra, he engaged Iwaki and the orchestra to record it. Kurosawa had the orchestra play up to 40 takes of the music. The running time of the soundtrack is just over an hour and was re-released in 2016 after its original release in 1985 by Silva Screen productions. It was produced by Reynold da Silva and David Stoner. Themes The futile sacrifice of Hidetora's concubines during the castle massacre The analogy of the development of Ran to Shakespeare's King Lear extends also to the thematic elements as they are found in the film. As with King Lear, the central theme of the film is its thematic study of the inheritance of power intergenerationally between a single parent and his three children. John F. Danby argues by analogy that Lear dramatizes, among other things, the contrasting meanings of \\"Nature\\". In Ran, the thematic study in cinematography and content of \\"nature\\" and the \\"natural\\" are revisited numerous times from the starting scene depicting expansive clouds to the closing scene depicting a sole figure filmed against an expansive landscape. The \\"unnatural\\", or the word \\"Ran\\" translated as chaos or the \\"disordered\\", occurs in the thematically recurrent scenes of warfare and nihilism depicted throughout the film. In analogy to Shakespeare, Kurosawa reflects a debate in Shakespeare's time about what human nature and nature really were like. There are thematically two strongly contrasting views of human nature in Kurosawa's film: that of Hidetora's party (analogous to Lear, Gloucester, Albany, Kent), and that of his older sons who come to rule (analogous to Edmund, Cornwall, Goneril, and Regan). As with Shakespeare, Kurosawa's film thematically explores these two aspects of human nature. Lady Kaeda and her husband are the new inheriting generation, members of an age of competition, suspicion, glory, in contrast with the older society which has come down from Hidetora and his times, with its belief in co-operation, reasonable decency, and respect for the whole as greater than the part. Ran, like King Lear, is thus an allegory. The older society, that of the medieval vision, with its doting king and warlord, falls into error, and is threatened by the new inheriting generation; it is partially regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in Hidetora's rejected youngest son, which ultimately fails. The three themes of chaos, nihilism, and warfare recur throughout the film. With reference to chaos, in many scenes Kurosawa foreshadows it by filming approaching cumulonimbus clouds, which finally break into a raging storm during the castle massacre. Hidetora is an autocrat whose powerful presence keeps the countryside unified and at peace. His abdication frees up other characters, such as Jiro and Lady Kaede, to pursue their own agendas, which they do with absolute ruthlessness. While the title is almost certainly an allusion to Hidetora's decision to abdicate (and the resulting mayhem that follows), there are other examples of the disorder of life, what Michael Sragow calls a \\"trickle-down theory of anarchy\\". The death of Taro ultimately elevates Lady Kaede to power and turns Jiro into an unwilling pawn in her schemes. Saburo's decision to rescue Hidetora ultimately draws in two rival warlords and leads to an unwanted battle between Jiro and Saburo, culminating in the destruction of the Ichimonji clan. The ultimate example of chaos is the absence of gods. When Hidetora sees Lady Su√©, a devout Buddhist and the most religious character in the film, he tells her, \\"Buddha is gone from this miserable world.\\" Su√©, despite her belief in love and forgiveness, eventually has her head cut off. When Kyoami claims that the gods either do not exist or are the cause of human suffering, Tango responds, \\"[The gods] can't save us from ourselves.\\" Kurosawa has repeated the point, saying \\"humanity must face life without relying on God or Buddha\\". The last shot of the film shows Tsurumaru standing on top of the ruins of his family castle. Unable to see, he stumbles towards the edge until he almost falls over. He drops the scroll of the Buddha his sister had given him and just stands there, \\"a blind man at the edge of a precipice, bereft of his god, in a darkening world\\". This may symbolize the modern concept of the death of God, as Kurosawa also stated, \\"Man is perfectly alone ... [Tsurumaru] represents modern humanity.\\" In addition to its chaotic elements, Ran also contains a strong element of nihilism, which is present from the opening sequence, where Hidetora mercilessly hunts down a boar only to refrain from eating it, to the last scene with Tsurumaru. Roger Ebert describes Ran as \\"a 20th-century film set in medieval times, in which an old man can arrive at the end of his life having won all his battles, and foolishly thinks he still has the power to settle things for a new generation. But life hurries ahead without any respect for historical continuity; his children have their own lusts and furies. His will is irrelevant, and they will divide his spoils like dogs tearing at a carcass.\\" This marked a radical departure from Kurosawa's earlier films, many of which balanced pessimism with hopefulness. Only Throne of Blood, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth, had as bleak an outlook. Even Kagemusha, though it chronicled the fall of the Takeda clan and their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Nagashino, had ended on a note of regret rather than despair. By contrast, the world of Ran is a Hobbesian world, where life is an endless cycle of suffering and everybody is a villain or a victim, and in many cases both. Heroes like Saburo may do the right thing, but in the end they are doomed as well. Unlike other Kurosawa heroes, like Kikuchiyo in Seven Samurai or Watanabe from Ikiru, who die performing great acts, Saburo dies pointlessly. Gentle characters like Lady Su√© are doomed to fall victim to the evil and violence around them, and conniving characters like Jiro or Lady Kaede are never given a chance to atone and are predestined to a life of wickedness culminating in violent death. Reception =Box office= Released on June 1, 1985, it was modestly successful financially in Japan. It earned ($12 million) in Japan, just enough to break even. In France, where it released on 18 September 1985, the film sold 813,081 tickets, grossing an estimated F (). In the United States, where it released in December 1985, the film earned $2‚Äì3 million upon its initial release, and a 2000 re-release accumulated $337,112. Including later re- releases in 2010 and 2016, the film grossed $4,135,750 in the United States and Canada. In Germany, where it released in 1986, the film sold 222,862 tickets, grossing an estimated ($714,912). The film also grossed $18,692 in the United Kingdom, and $16,215 in Portugal. This brings the film's total estimated gross to approximately worldwide. =Critical reviews= Ran was critically acclaimed upon its premiere. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96%, based on 78 reviews, and an average rating of 9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Akira Kurosawa's sprawling, epic take on King Lear should be required viewing for fans of westerns, war movies, or period films in general.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 96 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Shawn Levy, of the Portland Oregonian wrote, \\"In many respects, it's Kurosawa's most sumptuous film, a feast of color, motion and sound: Considering that its brethren include Kagemusha, Seven Samurai and Dersu Uzala, the achievement is extraordinary.\\"Shawn Levy, Review of Ran, Portland Oregonian, 1 Dec 2000, p.26. Writing for the Chicago Sun- Times, Roger Ebert stated, \\"Ran is a great, glorious achievement.\\" In the San Francisco Examiner, G. Allen Johnson stated: \\"Kurosawa pulled out all the stops with Ran, his obsession with loyalty and his love of expressionistic film techniques allowed to roam freely.\\"G. Allen Johnson. Review of Ran, San Francisco Examiner. Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Bob Graham stated: \\"In Ran, the horrors of life are transformed by art into beauty. It is finally so moving that the only appropriate response is silence.\\" Gene Siskel writing for the Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"The physical scale of Ran is overwhelming. It's almost as if Kurosawa is saying to all the cassette buyers of America, in a play on Clint Eastwood's phrase, 'Go ahead, ruin your night'‚Äîwait to see my film on a small screen and cheat yourself out of what a movie can be.\\" Vincent Canby writing for The New York Times stated: \\"Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, Ran has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable.\\" Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, with extended commentary, \\"Kurosawa (while directing Ran) often must have associated himself with the old lord as he tried to put this film together, but in the end he has triumphed, and the image I have of him, at 75, is of three arrows bundled together.\\" In 2000, it was inducted into Ebert's Great Movies list. Michal Sragow writing for Salon in 2000 summarized the Shakespearean origins of the play: \\"Kurosawa's Lear is a 16th century warlord who has three sons and a career studded with conquests. Kurosawa's genius is to tell his story so that every step suggests how wild and savage a journey it has been. At the start, this bold, dominating figure, now called Hidetora, is a sacred monster who wants to be a sort of warlord emeritus. He hopes to bequeath power to his oldest son while retaining his own entourage and emblems of command. He hasn't reckoned with the ambition of his successor or the manipulative skill of his heir's wife, who goes for the sexual and political jugular of anyone who invades her sphere.\\" =Accolades= Ran was completed too late to be entered at Cannes and had its premiere at Japan's first Tokyo International Film Festival. Kurosawa skipped the film's premiere, angering many in the Japanese film industry. As a result, it was not submitted as Japan's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Oscars. Serge Silberman tried to get it nominated as a French co-production but failed. However, American director Sidney Lumet helped organize a campaign to have Kurosawa nominated as Best Director. Ran was nominated for Academy Awards for art direction, cinematography, costume design (which it won), and Kurosawa's direction. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. In Japan, Ran was conspicuously not nominated for \\"Best Picture\\" at the Awards of the Japanese Academy. However, it won two prizes, for best art direction and best music score, and received four other nominations, for best cinematography, best lighting, best sound, and best supporting actor (Hitoshi Ueki, who played Saburo's patron, Lord Fujimaki). Ran won two awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for best foreign language film and best make-up artist, and was nominated for best cinematography, best costume design, best production design, and best screenplay‚Äìadapted. Despite its limited commercial success at the time of its release, the film's accolades have improved greatly, and it is now regarded as one of Kurosawa's masterpieces.Ebert, Roger. \\"Ran (1985)\\".

Particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use. Energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial (electric) lighting or from passive solar heating. Artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimming/switching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight - a process known as daylight harvesting. The amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation. Computer programs such as Radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design. The human eye's response to light is non-linear, so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter. The source of all daylight is the Sun. The proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight. \\"Direct sunlight\\" reaches a site without being scattered within Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is \\"diffused daylight\\". Sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylight. Each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage, so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates. There is no direct sunlight on the polar- side wall (north-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and south-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere) of a building from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox at latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side, but more and larger windows on the equatorial side (south- facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere). Equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year (except in the tropics in summertime), so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows. At higher latitudes during midwinter, light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows. This may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion, light pipes or tubes, and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces. At fairly low latitudes in summertime, windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator. Types =Windows= Windows are the most common way to admit daylight into a space. Their vertical orientation means that they selectively admit sunlight and diffuse daylight at different times of the day and year. Therefore, windows on multiple orientations must usually be combined to produce the right mix of light for the building, depending on the climate and latitude. There are three ways to improve the amount of light available from a window: (a) placing the window close to a light colored wall, (b) slanting the sides of window openings so the inner opening is larger than the outer opening, or (c) using a large light colored window-sill to project light into the room. Different types and grades of glass and different window treatments can also affect the amount of light transmission through the windows. The type of glazing is an important issue, expressed by its VT coefficient (Visual Transmittance), also known as visual light transmittance (VLT). As the name suggests, this coefficient measures how much visible light is admitted by the window. A low VT (below 0.4) can reduce by half or more the light coming into a room. But be also aware of high VT glass: high VT numbers (say, above 0.60) can be a cause of glare. On the other hand, you should also take into account the undesirable effects of large windows. Windows grade into translucent walls (below). Clerestory windows Another important element in creating daylighting is the use of clerestory windows. These are high, vertically placed windows. They can be used to increase direct solar gain when oriented towards the equator. When facing toward the sun, clerestories and other windows may admit unacceptable glare. In the case of a passive solar house, clerestories may provide a direct light path to polar- side (north in the northern hemisphere; south in the southern hemisphere) rooms that otherwise would not be illuminated. Alternatively, clerestories can be used to admit diffuse daylight (from the north in the northern hemisphere) that evenly illuminates a space such as a classroom or office. Often, clerestory windows also shine onto interior wall surfaces painted white or another light color. These walls are placed so as to reflect indirect light to interior areas where it is needed. This method has the advantage of reducing the directionality of light to make it softer and more diffuse, reducing shadows. Sawtooth roof Another roof-angled glass alternative is a sawtooth roof (found on older factories). Sawtooth roofs have vertical roof glass facing away from the equator side of the building to capture diffused light (not harsh direct equator-side solar gain). The angled portion of the glass-support structure is opaque and well insulated with a cool roof and radiant barrier. The sawtooth roof's lighting concept partially reduces the summer \\"solar furnace\\" skylight problem, but still allows warm interior air to rise and touch the exterior roof glass in the cold winter, with significant undesirable heat transfer. =Skylights= Modern skylight Skylights are light transmitting fenestration (products filling openings in a building envelope which also includes windows, doors, etc.) forming all, or a portion of, the roof of a building space. Skylights are widely used in daylighting design in residential and commercial buildings, mainly because they are the most effective source of daylight on a unit area basis. An alternative to a skylight is a roof lantern. A roof lantern is a daylighting cupola that sits above a roof, as opposed to a skylight which is fitted into a roof's construction. Roof lanterns serve as both an architectural feature and a method of introducing natural light into a space, and are typically wooden or metal structures with a number of glazed glass panels. =Atrium= An atrium is a large open space located within a building. It is often used to light a central circulation or public area by daylight admitted through a glass roof or wall. Atria provide some daylight to adjacent working areas, but the amount is often small and does not penetrate very far. The main function of an atrium is to provide a visual experience and a degree of contact with the outside for people in the working areas. The daylighting of successive storeys of rooms adjoining an atrium is interdependent and requires a balanced approach. Light from the sky can easily penetrate the upper storeys but not the lower, which rely primarily on light reflected from internal surfaces of the atrium such as floor-reflected light. The upper stories need less window area than the lower ones, and if the atrium walls are light in color the upper walls will reflect light toward the lower stories. =Translucent walls= Glass brick wall, outdoors Glass brick wall, indoors Bottle wall Walls made of glass brick are translucent to transparent. Traditionally, they are hollow and grouted with a fine concrete grout, but some modern glass brick walls are solid cast glass grouted with a transparent glue. If the glue matches the refractive index of the glass, the wall can be fairly transparent. Increasing the amount of concrete, bottle walls embed bottles that run right through the wall, transmitting light. Concrete walls with glass prisms running through them have also been made. With the advent of cheaper optical fibers, fiber-optic concrete walls. Daylight (and shadow images) can then pass directly through a solid concrete wall, making it translucent; fiber optics will lead light around bends and over tens of meters. Typically only a few percent of the light is transmitted (the percent transmittance is about half the percent of the surface that is fibers, and usually only ~5% fibers are used). Both glass and concrete conduct heat fairly well, when solid, so none of these walls insulate well. They are therefore often used outdoors, as a divider between two heated spaces (see images), or in very temperate climates. Greenhouse walls (and roofs) are made to transmit as much light and as little heat as possible. They use a variety of materials, and may be transparent or translucent. =Remote distribution= It is possible to provide some daylight into spaces that have low possibility of windows or skylights through remote distribution devices such as mirrors, prisms, or light tubes. This is called anidolic lighting, from anidolic (non-image-forming) optics. The non-linear response of the human eye to light means that spreading light to a broader area of a room makes the room appear brighter, and makes more of it usefully lit. Remote daylight distribution systems have losses, and the further they have to transmit the daylight and the more convoluted the path, the greater the inefficiency. The efficiency of many remote distribution systems can also vary dramatically from clear to overcast skies. Nonetheless, where there is no other possibility of providing daylight to a space, remote distribution systems can be appreciated. Light reflectors and shelves Once used extensively in office buildings, the manually adjustable light reflector is seldom in use today having been supplanted by a combination of other methods in concert with artificial illumination. The reflector had found favor where the choices of artificial light provided poor illumination compared to modern electric lighting. Light shelves are an effective way to enhance the lighting from windows on the equator-facing side of a structure, this effect being obtained by placing a white or reflective metal light shelf outside the window. Usually the window will be protected from direct summer season sun by a projecting eave. The light shelf projects beyond the shadow created by the eave and reflects sunlight upward to illuminate the ceiling. This reflected light can contain little heat content and the reflective illumination from the ceiling will typically reduce deep shadows, reducing the need for general illumination. In the cold winter, a natural light shelf is created when there is snow on the ground which makes it reflective. Low winter sun (see Sun path) reflects off the snow and increases solar gain through equator-facing glass by one- to two-thirds which brightly lights the ceiling of these rooms. Glare control (drapes) may be required. Prisms Daylight redirecting film bending light upwards The oldest use of prisms for daylighting may well be deck prisms, let into the decks of ships to transmit light below. Later, pavement lights or vault lights were used to light basement areas under sidewalks. Prisms that used total internal reflection to throw light sideways, lighting the deeper portions of a room, later became popular. Early thick, slow-cooling cast glass prism tiles were often known as \\"luxfer tiles\\" after a major manufacturer. They were and are used in the upper portions of windows, and some believe that they contributed to the trend from dark, subdivided Victorian interiors to open-plan, light-coloured ones. Daylight redirecting window film (DRF) is a thin plastic version of the old glass prism tiles. It can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds. Light tubes Another type of device used is the light tube, also called a tubular daylighting device (TDD), which is placed into a roof and admits light to a focused area of the interior. These somewhat resemble recessed ceiling light fixtures. They do not allow as much heat transfer as skylights because they have less surface area. TDDs use modern technology to transmit visible light through opaque walls and roofs. The tube itself is a passive component consisting of either a simple reflective interior coating or a light conducting fiber optic bundle. It is frequently capped with a transparent, roof-mounted dome \\"light collector\\" and terminated with a diffuser assembly that admits the daylight into interior spaces and distributes the available light energy evenly (or else efficiently if the use of the lit space is reasonably fixed, and the user desired one or more \\"bright-spots\\"). The tubular daylighting device was invented by Solatube International in 1986 and brought to market first in Australia in 1991. =Active daylighting= Active daylighting is a system of collecting sunlight using a mechanical device to increase the efficiency of light collection for a given lighting purpose. Active daylighting systems are different from passive daylighting systems in that passive systems are stationary and do not actively follow or track the sun.Active Daylighting retrieved 9 February 2009 There are two types of active daylighting control systems: closed loop solar tracking, and open loop solar tracking systems. *Closed loop systems track the sun by relying on a set of lens or sensors with a limited field of view, directed at the sun, and are fully illuminated by sunlight at all times. As the sun moves, it begins to shade one or more sensors, which the system detect and activates motors or actuators to move the device back into a position where all sensors are once again equally illuminated.A new strategy for EUCLIDES subdegree solar tracking *Open loop systems track the sun without physically following the sun via sensors (although sensors may be used for calibration). These systems typically employ electronic logic which controls device motors or actuators to follow the sun based on a mathematical formula. This formula is typically a pre-programmed sun path chart, detailing where the sun will be at a given latitude and at a given date and time for each day. Smart glass Smart glass is the name given to a class of materials and devices that can be switched between a transparent state and a state which is opaque, translucent, reflective, or retro-reflective. The switching is done by applying a voltage to the material, or by performing some simple mechanical operation. Windows, skylights, etc., that are made of smart glass can be used to adjust indoor lighting, compensating for changes of the brightness of the light outdoors and of the required brightness indoors. Solar lighting =Heliostats= The use of heliostats, mirrors which are moved automatically to reflect sunlight in a constant direction as the sun moves across the sky, is gaining popularity as an energy-efficient method of lighting. A heliostat can be used to shine sunlight directly through a window or skylight, or into any arrangement of optical elements, such as light tubes, that distribute the light where it is needed. The image shows a mirror that rotates on a computer-controlled, motor- driven altazimuth mount. =Solar street lights= Solar street lights raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure. The solar array of such off-grid PV system charges a rechargeable battery, which powers a fluorescent or LED lamp during the night. Solar street lights are stand-alone power systems, and have the advantage of savings on trenching, landscaping, and maintenance costs, as well as on the electric bills, despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting. They are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation, they are expected to dim only slightly. =Hybrid solar lighting= Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has developed a new alternative to skylights called hybrid solar lighting. This design uses a roof-mounted light collector, large- diameter optical fiber, and modified efficient fluorescent lighting fixtures that have transparent rods connected to the optical fiber cables. Essentially no electricity is needed for daytime natural interior lighting. Field tests conducted in 2006 and 2007 of the new HSL technology were promising, but the low-volume equipment production is still expensive. HSL should become more cost effective in the near future. A version that can withstand windstorms could begin to replace conventional commercial fluorescent lighting systems with improved implementations in 2008 and beyond. The U.S. 2007 Energy Bill provides funding for HSL R&D;, and multiple large commercial buildings are ready to fund further HSL application development and deployment. At night, ORNL HSL uses variable-intensity fluorescent lighting electronic control ballasts. As the sunlight gradually decreases at sunset, the fluorescent fixture is gradually turned up to give a near-constant level of interior lighting from daylight until after it becomes dark outside. HSL may soon become an option for commercial interior lighting. It can transmit about half of the direct sunlight it receives. Solarium In a well-designed isolated solar gain building with a solarium, sunroom, greenhouse, etc., there is usually significant glass on the equator side. A large area of glass can also be added between the sun room and the interior living quarters. Low-cost, high-volume-produced patio door safety glass is an inexpensive way to accomplish this goal. The doors used to enter a room should be opposite the sun room interior glass, so that a user can see outside immediately when entering most rooms. Halls should be minimized with open spaces used instead. If a hall is necessary for privacy or room isolation, inexpensive patio door safety glass can be placed on both sides of the hall. Drapes over the interior glass can be used to control lighting. Drapes can optionally be automated with sensor-based electric motor controls that are aware of room occupancy, daylight, interior temperature, and time of day. Passive solar buildings with no central air conditioning system need control mechanisms for hourly, daily, and seasonal, temperature-and-daylight variations. If the temperature is correct, and a room is unoccupied, the drapes can automatically close to reduce heat transfer in either direction. To help distribute sun room daylight to the sides of rooms that are farthest from the equator, inexpensive ceiling- to-floor mirrors can be used. Building codes require a second means of egress, in case of fire. Most designers use a door on one side of bedrooms, and an outside window, but west-side windows provide very-poor summer thermal performance. Instead of a west-facing window, designers use an R-13 foam- filled solid energy-efficient exterior door. It may have a glass storm door on the outside so that light can pass through when the inner door is opened. East/west glass doors and windows should be fully shaded top-to-bottom or a spectrally selective coating can be used to reduce solar gain. Design Architects and interior designers often use daylighting as a design element. Good daylighting requires attention to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of design. =Qualitative= Utilizing natural light is one of the design aspects in architecture; In 1929, the French architect, Le Corbusier said that \\"The history of architectural material... has been the endless struggle for light... in other words, the history of windows.\\" As he emphasized in his architecture (such as Notre Dame du Haut), daylighting has been a major architectural design element (See MIT Chapel and Church of the Light for examples). Not only the aesthetic aspects, the impact of daylighting on human health and work performance is also considered as qualitative daylighting. The current studies show that lighting conditions in workplaces contribute to a variety of factors related to work satisfaction, productivity and well-being and significantly higher visual acceptance scores under daylighting than electrical lighting. Studies have also shown that light has a direct effect on human health because of the way it influences the circadian rhythms. =Quantitative= A well daylit space needs both adequate lighting levels and light that is well distributed. In the current building industry, daylighting is considered a building performance measure in green building certification programs such as LEED. Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) and the society of Light and Lighting (SLL) provide illuminance recommendation for each space type. How much daylighting contributes to the recommended lighting level determines daylighting performance of a building. There are two metrics that IES has approved to evaluate daylighting performance: Spatial Daylight Autonomy(sDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE). sDA is a metric describing annual sufficiency of ambient daylight levels in interior environments. See Daylight autonomy and LEED documentation sections for more details. Evaluation method =Field measurements= In existing buildings, field measurements can be undertaken to evaluate daylighting performance. Illuminance measurements on a grid is a basic level to derive an average illuminance of a space. The spacing of the measurement points vary with project purposes. The height of these points depends on where the primary task is performed. In most office spaces, desk level (0.762m above the floor) will be measured. Based on measurements, average illuminance, maximum-to-minimum uniformity ratio, and average-to-minimum uniformity ratio will be calculated and compared to the recommended lighting level. A diagnostic survey specific to lighting can be conducted to analyse the satisfaction of building occupants. =Computational simulations= Computational simulations can predict daylighting condition of a space much faster and more detailed than hand calculations or scale model testing. The simulations allow for the effects of climate with hourly weather data from typical meteorological year. Computer models are available which can predict variations in internally reflected light. Radiosity and ray-tracing are methods can deal with complex geometry, allow complex sky distributions and potentially produce photorealistic images. Radiosity methods assume all surfaces are perfectly diffusing to reduce computational times. Ray-tracing techniques have accuracy and image rendering capacity. Autonomy Daylight autonomy is the percentage of time that daylight levels are above a specified target illuminance within a physical space or building. The calculation is based on annual data and the predetermined lighting levels. The goal of the calculation is to determine how long an individual can work in a space without requiring electrical lighting, while also providing optimal visual and physical comfort. Daylight autonomy is beneficial when determining how daylight enters and illuminates a space. The drawback, however, is that there is no upper limit on luminance levels. Therefore, a space with a high internal heat gain deemed uncomfortable by occupants, would still perform well in the analysis. Achieving daylight autonomy requires an integrated design approach that guides the building form, siting, climate considerations, building components, lighting controls, and lighting design criteria. =Continuous= Continuous daylight autonomy, is similar to daylight autonomy but partial credit is attributed to time steps when the daylight illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level. For example, if the target illuminance is 400 lux and the calculated value is 200 lux, daylight autonomy would give zero credit, while continuous daylight autonomy would give 0.5 credit (200/400 = 0.5). The benefit of continuous daylight autonomy is that it does not give a hard threshold of acceptable illuminance. Instead, it addresses the transition area‚Äîallowing for realistic preferences within any given space. For example, office occupants usually prefer to work at daylight below the illuminance threshold since this level avoids potential glare and excessive contrast. =Useful illuminance= Useful daylight illuminance focuses on the direct sunlight that falls into a space. The useful daylight illuminance calculation is based on three factors‚Äîthe percentage of time a point is below, between, or above an illuminance value. The range for these factors is typically 100-2,000 lux. Useful daylight illuminance is similar to daylight autonomy but has the added benefit of addressing glare and thermal discomfort. The upper threshold is used to determine when glare or thermal discomfort is occurring and may need resolution. LEED documentation The LEED 2009 daylighting standards were intended to connect building occupants with the outdoors through use of optimal daylighting techniques and technologies. According to these standards, the maximum value of 1 point can be achieved through four different approaches. The first approach is a computer simulation to demonstrate, in clear sky conditions, the daylight illuminance levels 108-5,400 lux on, September 21 between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Another prescriptive approach is a method that uses two types of side-lighting, and three types of top-lighting to determine if a minimum of 75% daylighting is achieved in the occupied spaces. A third approach uses indoor light measurements showing that between 108-5,400 lux have been achieved in the space. The last approach is a combination of the other three calculation methods to prove that the daylight illumination requirements are achieved. The LEED 2009 documentation is based upon the daylight factor calculation. The daylight factor calculation is based on uniform overcast skies. It is most applicable in Northern Europe and parts of North America. Daylight factor is ‚Äúthe ratio of the illuminance at a point on a plane, generally the horizontal work plane, produced by the luminous flux received directly or indirectly at that point from a sky whose luminance distribution is known, to the illuminance on a horizontal plane produced by an unobstructed hemisphere of this same sky.\\" LEED v4 daylighting standards are the most current as of 2014. The new standards are similar to the old standards, but also intend to ‚Äúreinforce circadian rhythms, and reduce the use of electrical lighting by introducing daylight in the space. Two options exist for achieving the maximum value of these two most recent points. One option is to use a computer simulation to demonstrate that a spatial daylight autonomy of 300 lux for at least 50% of the time, and an annual sunlight exposure of 1,000 lux for 250 occupied hours per year, exists in the space. Another option is to show that illuminance levels are between 300 lux and 3,000 lux between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on a clear day at the equinox for 75% or 90% of the floor area in the space. The overall goal of the LEED v4 daylighting metrics is to analyze both the quantity and quality of the light, as well as to balance the use of glazing to ensure more light and less cooling load.

The Lord of Misrule was generally a peasant or sub-deacon appointed to be in charge of Christmas revelries, which often included drunkenness and wild partying. The Church in England held a similar festival involving a boy bishop. This custom was abolished by Henry VIII in 1541, restored by the Catholic Mary I and again abolished by Protestant Elizabeth I, though here and there it lingered on for some time longer. On the Continent it was suppressed by the Council of Basel in 1431, but was revived in some places from time to time, even as late as the eighteenth century. In the Tudor period, the Lord of Misrule (sometimes called the Abbot of Misrule or the King of Misrule) is mentioned a number of times by contemporary documents referring to revels both at court and among the ordinary people. In the spirit of misrule, identified by the grinning masks in the corners, medieval floor tiles from the Derby Black Friary show a triumphant hunting hare mounted on a dog. While mostly known as a British holiday custom, some folklorists, such as James Frazer and Mikhail Bakhtin (who is said to have plagiarized the novel idea from Frazer), have claimed that the appointment of a Lord of Misrule comes from a similar custom practised during the Roman celebration of Saturnalia. In ancient Rome, from 17 to 23 December (in the Julian calendar), a man chosen to be a mock king was appointed for the feast of Saturnalia, in the guise of the Roman deity Saturn; at the end of the festival, the man was sacrificed. This hypothesis has been heavily criticized by William Warde Fowler and as such, the Christmas custom of the Lord of Misrule during the Christian era and the Saturnalian custom of antiquity may have completely separate origins; the two separate customs, however, can be compared and contrasted. History = Ancient Rome = On 1 January, AD 400, the bishop Asterius of Amasea in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey) preached a sermon against the Feast of Calends (\\"this foolish and harmful delight\\") that describes the role of the mock king in Late Antiquity. The New Year's feast included children arriving at each doorstep, exchanging their gifts for reward: \\"Asterius of Amasia, Sermons (1904). Preface to the online edition\\", Roger Pearse (translator), Ipswich, UK, December 2003, webpage: ECWritings-Aste. \\"On the Festival of the Calends\\", Asterius, AD 400. It contrasted with the Christian celebration held, not by chance, on the adjoining day: Significantly, for Asterius the Christian feast was explicitly an entry from darkness into light, and although no conscious solar nature could have been expressed, it is certainly the renewed light at midwinter that was celebrated among Roman pagans, officially from the time of Aurelian, as the \\"festival of the birth of the Unconquered Sun\\". Meanwhile, throughout the city of Amasea, although entry into the temples and holy places had been forbidden by the decree of Theodosius I (391), the festival of gift-giving when \\"all is noise and tumult\\" in \\"a rejoicing over the new year\\" with a kiss and the gift of a coin, went on all around, to the intense disgust and scorn of the bishop: Honest farmers coming into the city were likely to be jeered at, spanked\\"Flogged\\" is the bishop's unlikely remark. and robbed. Worse, However, according to the anthropologist James Frazer, there was a darker side to the Saturnalia festival. In Durostorum on the Danube (modern Silistra), Roman soldiers would choose a man from among them to be the Lord of Misrule for thirty days. At the end of that thirty days, his throat was cut on the altar of Saturn. Similar origins of the British Lord of Misrule, as a sacrificial king (a \\"temporary king\\", as Frazer puts it) who was later put to death for the benefit of all, have also been recorded.Frazer, The New Golden Bough, ed. Theodor H. Gaster, part 7 \\"Between Old and New: Periods of License\\", New York: Criterion Books, 1959; rpt. New York: New American Library, 1964. pp. 643‚Äì644; 645‚Äì650 References to Frazer's view of this ancient sacrifice were made in the 1973 film The Wicker Man. While the later Roman custom of a Lord of Misrule as a master of revels, a figure of fun and no more than that, is most familiar, there does seem to be some indication of an earlier and more unpleasant aspect to this figure. Frazer recounts: = Tudor England = Cruikshank In the Tudor period, John Stow in his Survey of London, published in 1603, gives a description of the Lord of Misrule: > [I]n the feaste of Christmas, there was in the kinges house, wheresoeuer hee > was lodged, a Lord of Misrule, or Maister of merry disports, and the like > had yee in the house of euery noble man, of honor, or good worshippe, were > he spirituall or temporall. Amongst the which the Mayor of London, and > eyther of the shiriffes had their seuerall Lordes of Misrule, euer > contending without quarrell or offence, who should make the rarest pastimes > to delight the Beholders. These Lordes beginning their rule on Alhollon Eue > [Halloween], continued the same till the morrow after the Feast of the > Purification, commonlie called Candlemas day: In all which space there were > fine and subtle disguisinges, Maskes and Mummeries, with playing at Cardes > for Counters, Nayles and pointes in euery house, more for pastimes then for > gaine. The Lord of Misrule is also referred to by Philip Stubbes in his Anatomie of Abuses (1585) where he states that \\"the wilde heades of the parishe conventynge together, chuse them a grand Capitaine (of mischeefe) whom they ennobel with the title Lorde of Misrule\\". He then gives a description of the way they dress colourfully, tie bells onto their legs and \\"go to the churche (though the minister be at praier or preachyng) dauncying and swingyng their handercheefes\\".  Decline of the custom in Britain  The Oxford Movement and writings by authors such as Charles Dickens brought the religious and family oriented aspects of Christmastide to the forefront of the celebration, cementing popular traditions that are maintained to this day With the rise of the Puritan party in the 17th century Church of England, the custom of the Lord of Misrule was outlawed as it was deemed \\"disruptive\\"; even after the Restoration, the custom remained banned and soon became forgotten. In the early 19th century, the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church ushered in \\"the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo- Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival\\" as well as \\"special charities for the poor\\" in addition to \\"special services and musical events\\". Charles Dickens and other writers helped in this revival of the holiday by \\"changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated\\" as they emphasized family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some places.

It can include all aspects in making a film: sound, mise-en-sc√®ne, dialogue, cinematography, editing or attitude. Style Director A director has a distinctive filmmaking style that differs from other directors, similar to an author's own distinctive writing style. Through the analysis of film techniques, differences between filmmakers' styles become apparent.Bordwell, David; Kristin Thompson (2003). Film Art: An Introduction (Seventh edition ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. There are many technical possibilities to use in a film. As a result, no single film can have every single technique. Historical circumstances limit the choices for the director. During the silent film era, filmmakers were not able to use synchronized dialogue until sound became possible in the late 1920s. Films before the 1930s had to be black and white; now directors have the choice of shooting in color tints or in black and white. There are many techniques that a director has to choose which techniques to use and which ones not to use. One of the most noticeable ways to adjust film style is through mise-en-sc√®ne, or what appears on the screen. Lighting, costumes, props, camera movements, and backgrounds are all part of mis-en-scene. There are countless ways to create a film based on the same script simply through changing the mise-en- sc√®ne.Gibbs, John. Mise-en-sc√®ne. United Kingdom: Wallflower Press, 2002. , 9781903364062 Adjusting these techniques creates meaning and highlights similarities in the narrative. Many filmmakers will relate the overall film style to reflect the story. Style and the audience Most films conform to the Classical Hollywood narrative film style, which has a set of guidelines that the films tend to follow. The story in this style is told chronologically in a cause and effect relationship. The main principle in this film style is continuity editing, where editing, camera, and sound should be considered \\"invisible\\" to the viewers. In other words, attention should not be brought to these elements. While many films conform to these guidelines, there are other films that ignore the guidelines and bring attention to the film techniques. The films violate the standard rules of film in order to have an innovative style or bring attention to certain techniques. The director decides what is and is not on the screen. They help guide what the audience looks at and notices. Although the audience may not consciously notice film style, it still affects the viewer's experience of the film. When viewers go see a film, they have expectations about a film. Based on previous experience watching films, the audience expects that there are certain techniques that are commonly found in films. For example, after a long shot there will be a cut to a closer view. If a character is walking across the stage, the audience expects the camera to pan or follow the character's movement. Viewers expect to interact with and be a part of the film, rather than simply being shown a group of images. These expectations come from experiences with both the real and film worlds. The audience expects films to appear like real life, and be shot according to a certain style. Classical Hollywood narrative film styles and the conventions of other genres help to guide the audience in what to expect. Difference between genre and film style Film style is distinct from film genre, which categorizes films based on similar narrative structures. For instance, Western films are about the American West, love stories are about love, and so on. Film style categorizes films based on the techniques used in the making of the film, such as cinematography or lighting. Two films may be from the same genre, but they will probably look different based on the film style. For example, Independence Day and Cloverfield are both sci-fi, action films about the possible end of the world. However, they are shot completely differently, with Cloverfield using a handheld camera for the entire movie. Films in the same genre do not necessarily have the same film style. Therefore, film genre and film style are distinct film terms. Group style Film style can describe the techniques used by specific filmmakers, but it can also be used to describe a group of filmmakers from the same area and time period. Group style can include film styles such as German Expressionism, Italian Neorealism, Soviet Montage and French New Wave for example.

It was written and directed by Pare Lorentz. The film was narrated by the American actor and baritone Thomas Hardie Chalmers. In 1999, The Plow That Broke the Plains was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".  Production and content  The film was sponsored by the United States government (Resettlement Administration) to raise awareness about the New Deal and was intended to cost $6,000 or less; it eventually cost over $19,000 and Lorentz, turning in many receipts written on various scraps of paper, had many of his reimbursements denied and paid for much of the film himself. Lorentz later faced criticism for appearing to blame westward bound settlers for the ecological crisis by having eroded the soil of the Plains with unrestrained farming, but the film nonetheless succeeded in driving home the message of the severity of the problem caused by the misuse of land. According to Robert L. Snyder's book about Lorentz , the filmmaker's favorite comment about the movie was something he heard an audience member say in the row ahead of him: \\"They never should have plowed them plains.\\"  Soundtrack  Lorentz worked on the film with composer Virgil Thomson, who shared Lorentz's enthusiasm for folk music and incorporated many folk melodies, along with other popular and religious music, into the soundtrack. Virgil Thomson compiled a concert suite from his original score, which has been performed and recorded. Its first recording was made on RCA 78s in 1946 by the newly formed Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra under its founder and first conductor, Leopold Stokowski. One of the earliest stereo recordings was made for Vanguard Records in 1961, again with Leopold Stokowski, this time conducting the Symphony of the Air. The original Vanguard LP and its later CD reissue also included a suite from Thomson's score for another Lorentz documentary, The River. Alternate versions The film exists in at least three versions. The original includes an epilogue detailing the activities of the Resettlement Administration. The most common version today on DVD omits this final chapter. Finally, another contemporary version places the scrolling Prologue text before the opening credits.

Explanation and uses In Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), a point of order may be raised if the rules appear to have been broken. This may interrupt a speaker during debate, or anything else if the breach of the rules warrants it. The point is resolved before business continues. The point of order calls upon the chair to make a ruling. The chair may rule on the point of order or submit it to the judgment of the assembly. If the chair accepts the point of order, it is said to be ruled \\"well taken\\". If not, it is said to be ruled \\"not well taken\\". Generally, a point of order must be raised at the time the rules are broken or else it would be too late. For example, if a motion was made and discussion began on it, it would be too late to raise a point of order that the motion was not seconded. If such a motion was adopted without a second, it remains valid and not having a second becomes irrelevant. Exceptions to the rule that a point of order must be raised at the time of violation include that a point of order may be raised at any time a motion was adopted in violation of the bylaws or applicable law, in conflict with a previously adopted motion (unless adopted by the vote to rescind it), or in violation of a fundamental principle of parliamentary law. The ruling of the chair may be appealed to the assembly in most cases. A majority vote against the chair's ruling is required to overturn it. A point of order is sometimes erroneously used to present a request for information or a parliamentary inquiry. If a member asks such a question, the chair should treat the question as the appropriate request. Legislative use = Australia = Deriving from British practice, in the Australian House of Representatives it continues to be customary for a member raising a point of order while the House is voting to hold a sheet of paper over the top of their head. = India = In the Indian Parliament, both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, a point of order can raised in relation to the business before the House by any member of the parliament. The decision of the Chair is final and no debate is allowed on the point of order, the Chair may hear the members before giving the decision. = Ireland = In the Irish Oireachtas (parliament), a point of order can be used in relation to order in the assembly. However, the ruling of the chair in this assembly cannot be appealed. = United Kingdom = Until 1998 in the British House of Commons, it was required that a member raising a point of order while the House is voting be wearing a hat so they could be easily seen. Two opera hats were maintained in the House for this purpose. This practice was abolished in accordance with the findings of the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons. = United States = In the United States Senate, the chair's ruling on a point of order may be appealed by any Senator. Points of order with regard to the Budget Act or annual budget resolution may be waived by of the Senate's entire membership. Rule XVI, which prohibits normal legislation in appropriations legislation, may be waived by of the Senate. The United States House of Representatives also allows points of order and appeals.

Seaman. Loosely based on the 1981 novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? by Gary K. Wolf, the film stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, Charles Fleischer, Stubby Kaye and Joanna Cassidy. Set in a 1947 version of Hollywood where cartoon characters and people co-exist, the film follows Eddie Valiant, a private investigator who must exonerate Roger Rabbit, a \\"Toon\\" (i.e., cartoon character) who is accused of murdering a wealthy businessman. Walt Disney Pictures purchased the film rights for the film's story in 1981. Price and Seaman wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg and his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film while Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming, the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected. The film was released through Disney's Touchstone Pictures banner on June 22, 1988. It received acclaim from critics, who praised its visuals, humor, writing and performances. It grossed $329.8 million worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing films in the year. It brought a renewed interest in the Golden Age of American animation, spearheading modern American animation and the Disney Renaissance. It won three Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for its animation direction by Williams. In 2016, it was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot In 1947 Los Angeles, \\"toons\\" act in theatrical cartoon shorts as with live-action films; they regularly interact with real people and animals and reside in Toontown. Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother, Teddy, once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases, but after Teddy was killed by a toon, Eddie lapsed into alcoholism, lost his sense of humor, and vowed never to work for toons again. R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor performances of one of his biggest stars, Roger Rabbit. Maroon hires Eddie to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife Jessica being romantically involved with businessman Marvin Acme, owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at an underground nightclub, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty-cake in her dressing room, which he shows to Roger. Roger angrily declares that he and his wife will be happy, and he flees. The next morning, Acme is discovered dead at his factory, and evidence points to Roger being responsible. While investigating, Eddie meets Judge Doom, Toontown's intimidating superior court judge. He has created a substance dubbed \\"dip\\" that is capable of killing the otherwise invulnerable toons. Eddie later runs into Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, who believes Roger is innocent and that Acme's missing will, which will give the toons ownership of Toontown, may be the key to his murder. In his office, Eddie finds Roger, who begs him to help exonerate him. Eddie reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar, where his ex-girlfriend Dolores works. Jessica approaches Eddie and says that Maroon forced her to pose for the photographs so he could blackmail Acme. Doom and his toon weasel henchmen discover Roger, but he and Eddie escape with Benny, an anthropomorphic taxicab. They flee to a theater, where Eddie tells Roger that a toon killed Teddy when they were investigating a bank robbery. As they leave with Dolores, Eddie sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's trolley network shortly before Acme's murder. Eddie goes to the studio to confront Maroon, leaving Roger to guard outside, but Jessica knocks Roger out and puts him in the trunk. Maroon tells Eddie that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company so he could sell the studio, then tearfully admits he only did so out of fear for the safety of the toons. Maroon is killed by an unseen assailant before he can explain the consequences of the missing will. Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene, and assuming she is the culprit, follows her into Toontown. Once he apprehends her, Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and Maroon and that Acme gave her his will for safekeeping, but she discovered that the will was blank. She and Eddie are then captured by Doom and the weasels. At the Acme factory, Doom reveals his plot to destroy Toontown with a machine loaded with dip to build a freeway, the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf (which Doom owns) has bought out Los Angeles' Pacific Electric Railway. Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, and the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine's hose. Eddie performs a comedic vaudeville act, causing the weasels to die of laughter; Eddie kicks their leader into the machine's dip vat, killing him. Eddie fights Doom, who is flattened by a steamroller, but survives, exposing him as the very toon who killed Teddy. Eddie uses a toon boxing glove mallet that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him. The empty machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a train. Toons run in to regard Doom's remains, and Eddie discovers that Roger inadvertently wrote his love letter for Jessica on Acme's will, which was written in disappearing/reappearing ink. Roger shocks Eddie with a joy buzzer, and Eddie gives him a kiss, having regained his sense of humor. Eddie happily enters Toontown with Dolores alongside Roger, Jessica and the other toons.  Cast  Bob Hoskins played the role of Eddie Valiant. * Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant * Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom Corey Burton as the toon voice of Judge Doom * Charles Fleischer as the voices of Roger Rabbit, Benny the Cab, Greasy, and Psycho * Stubby Kaye as Marvin Acme * Joanna Cassidy as Dolores * Alan Tilvern as R.K.

The film was one of the final productions in which he voiced his Looney Tunes characters before his death the following year. Joe Alaskey voiced Yosemite Sam (in place of Blanc), Wayne Allwine voiced Mickey Mouse, Tony Anselmo voiced Donald Duck, Tony Pope voiced Goofy (also partially voiced by Bill Farmer) and the Big Bad Wolf, Mae Questel reprised her role of Betty Boop, Russi Taylor voiced Minnie Mouse and some birds, Pat Buttram, Jim Cummings (imitating Andy Devine), and Jim Gallant (imitating Walter Brennan) voiced Eddie's toon bullets, Les Perkins voiced Mr. Toad, Mary Radford voiced Hyacinth Hippo from Fantasia, Nancy Cartwright voiced the toon shoe, Cherry Davis voiced Woody Woodpecker, Peter Westy voiced Pinocchio, and Frank Welker voiced Dumbo. Animation director Richard Williams voiced Droopy. April Winchell voiced Mrs. Herman and the \\"baby noises\\". David Lander voiced Smart Ass, Fred Newman voiced Stupid, and June Foray voiced Wheezy and Lena Hyena, a toon who resembles Jessica and provides a comical role which shows her falling for Eddie and pursuing him. Archival recordings of Frank Sinatra were used for the Singing Sword, whose character design is based on Sinatra. Production =Development= Walt Disney Productions purchased the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, then president of Disney, saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster.Stewart, p.72 Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars) had been box-office bombs.Robert Zemeckis, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, Ken Ralston, Frank Marshall, Steve Starkey, DVD audio commentary, 2003, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive. The film was finally green-lit when the budget decreased to $30 million, which at the time still made it the most expensive animated film ever green-lit. Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live-action and animation would \\"save\\" Disney's animation department. Spielberg's contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the box-office profits. Disney kept all merchandising rights. Spielberg convinced Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, King Features Syndicate, Felix the Cat Productions, Turner Entertainment, and Universal Pictures/Walter Lantz Productions to \\"lend\\" their characters to appear in the film with (in some cases) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed; for example, Disney's Donald Duck and Warner Bros.' Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists, and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene. Apart from this agreement, Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of Roger Rabbit. However, the producers were unable to acquire the rights to use Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu, Casper, or the Terrytoons for appearances from their respective owners (King Features, Turner, Western Publishing, Harvey Comics, and Viacom). Terry Gilliam was offered the chance to direct, but he found the project too technically challenging. (\\"Pure laziness on my part,\\" he later admitted, \\"I completely regret that decision.\\") Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985, based on the success of Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future. Disney executives were continuing to suggest Darrell Van Citters to direct the animated sequences, but Spielberg and Zemeckis decided against it. Richard Williams was eventually hired to direct the animation. Zemeckis wanted the film to imbue \\"Disney's high quality of animation, Warner Bros.' characterization, and Tex Avery humor.\\"Don Hahn, Peter Schneider, Waking Sleeping Beauty DVD commentary, 2010, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment =Casting= Harrison Ford was Spielberg's original choice to play Eddie Valiant, but his price was too high. Chevy Chase was the second choice, but was not interested. Bill Murray was also considered for the role, but due to his idiosyncratic method of receiving offers for roles, Murray missed out on it. Eddie Murphy reportedly turned down the role as he misunderstood the concept of cartoon characters and human beings co- existing; he later regretted this decision. Several other actors were also considered for it, including Robin Williams, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone, Wallace Shawn, Ed Harris, Charles Grodin, and Don Lane. To facilitate Hoskins' performance, Charles Fleischer dressed in a Roger Rabbit costume and \\"stood in\\" behind camera for most scenes. Animation director Williams explained Roger was a combination of \\"Tex Avery's cashew nut-shaped head, the swatch of red hair... like Droopy's, Goofy's overalls, Porky Pig's bow tie, Mickey Mouse's gloves, and Bugs Bunny-like cheeks and ears.\\" Kathleen Turner provided the uncredited voice of Jessica Rabbit, Roger Rabbit's wife. Christopher Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Spielberg on Back to the Future. He compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, both being overly evil characters which he considered being \\"fun to play\\". He avoided blinking his eyes while on camera to perfectly portray the character. Tim Curry originally auditioned for the role, but afterward, the producers found him too terrifying. Christopher Lee was also considered for it, but turned it down. John Cleese also expressed interest for the role, but was deemed not scary enough. Several other actors were also considered, including Peter O‚ÄôToole, F. Murray Abraham, Roddy McDowall, Eddie Deezen, and Sting. Fleischer also voiced Benny the Cab, Psycho, and Greasy. Lou Hirsch, who voiced Baby Herman, was the original choice for Benny the Cab, but was replaced by Fleischer.Robert Zemeckis, Richard Williams, Bob Hoskins, Charles Fleischer, Frank Marshall, Alan Silvestri, Ken Ralston, Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit, 2003, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment =Writing= The plot incorporated the actual closing of Pacific Electric. Price and Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired. For inspiration, the two writers studied the work of Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation, especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons. The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by Chinatown. Price and Seaman said that \\"the Red Car plot, suburb expansion, urban and political corruption really did happen,\\" Price stated. \\"In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business. Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be.\\" In Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit?, the toons were comic-strip characters rather than movie stars. During the writing process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, but they made their final decision with newly created character Judge Doom. Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons.Who Shot Roger Rabbit, 1986 script by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman The Toon Patrol (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy, and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey), who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Originally, seven weasels were to mimic the dwarfs complement, but eventually, two of them, Slimey and Sleazy, were written out of the script. Further references included The \\"Ink and Paint Club\\" resembling the Harlem Cotton Club, while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of the dip to eliminate all the toons as Hitler's Final Solution. Doom was originally the hunter who killed Bambi's mother. Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a taxi cab. Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme's funeral, whose attendees included Eddie, Foghorn Leghorn, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Tom and Jerry, Heckle and Jeckle, Chip n' Dale, Felix the Cat, Herman and Katnip, Mighty Mouse, Superman, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, the Seven Dwarfs, Baby Huey, and Casper the Friendly Ghost in cameo appearances. However, the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage. Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film's title, working titles included Murder in Toontown, Toons, Dead Toons Don't Pay Bills, The Toontown Trial, Trouble in Toontown, and Eddie Goes to Toontown.DVD production notes =Filming= Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) threatens Roger Rabbit before introducing him to the dip. Mime artists, puppeteers, mannequins, and robotic arms were commonly used during filming to help the actors interact with \\"open air and imaginative cartoon characters\\". Animation director Richard Williams admitted he was \\"openly disdainful of the Disney bureaucracy\\" and refused to work in Los Angeles. To accommodate him and his animators, animation production moved to England where a studio, Walt Disney Animation UK (subsuming Richard Williams Animation), was created for this purpose; located at The Forum, 74-80 Camden Street, in Camden Town, London, not too far from where the live-action production was based at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England. Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing the film, they would help distribute his unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler. Supervising animators included Dale Baer, James Baxter, David Bowers, Andreas Deja, Chris Jenkins, Phil Nibbelink, Nik Ranieri, and Simon Wells, along with Bruce W. Smith. The animation production, headed by associate producer Don Hahn, was split between Walt Disney Animation UK and a specialized unit in Los Angeles, set up by Walt Disney Feature Animation and supervised by Dale Baer.Wolf, Scott (2008). \\"DON HAHN talks about 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'\\". Mouseclubhouse.com. Retrieved December 31, 2009. The production budget continued to escalate, while the shooting schedule lapsed longer than expected. When the budget reached $40 million, Disney CEO Michael Eisner seriously considered shutting down production, but Studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it.Stewart, p.87 Despite the budget escalating to over $50 million, Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg. VistaVision cameras installed with motion-control technology were used for the photography of the live-action scenes which would be composited with animation. Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and the Toon Patrol would portray the animated characters during rehearsals to teach the actors where to look when acting with \\"open air and imaginative cartoon characters\\". Many of the live-action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with either robotic arms holding the props or the props were manipulated by strings, similar to a marionette. The actor who played the voice of Roger, Charles Fleischer, insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set, to get into character. Filming began on November 2, 1986, and lasted for seven and a half months at Elstree Studios, with an additional month in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for blue screen effects of Toontown. The entrance of Desilu Studios served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot.Robert Zemeckis, Frank Marshall, Jeffrey Price, Peter Seaman, Steve Starkey, and Ken Ralston. Who Framed Roger Rabbit - Blu-ray audio commentary, 2013, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment =Animation and post- production= Post-production lasted for 14 months. Because the film was made before computer animation and digital compositing were widely used, all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing. First, the animators and layout artists were given black-and-white printouts of the live-action scenes (known as \\"photo stats\\"), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters in relationship to the live-action footage. Due to Zemeckis' dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not \\"slipping and slipping all over the place.\\" After rough animation was complete, it was run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background. The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians animated three lighting layers (shadows, highlights, and tone mattes) separately, to make the cartoon characters look three-dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set. Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica's dress in the nightclub scene, because it had flashing sequins, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool. =Music= Regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri composed the film score, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) under the direction of Silvestri. Zemeckis joked that \\"the British [musicians] could not keep up with Silvestri's jazz tempo\\". The performances of the music themes written for Jessica Rabbit were entirely improvised by the LSO. The work of American composer Carl Stalling heavily influenced Silvestri's work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The film's soundtrack was originally released by Buena Vista Records on June 22, 1988, and reissued by Walt Disney Records on CD on April 16, 2002. On January 23, 2018, Intrada Records released a 3-CD set with the complete score, alternates, and a remastered version of the original 1988 album plus music from three Roger Rabbit short films, composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton and James Horner. Release Michael Eisner, then-CEO, and Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of The Walt Disney Company, felt the film was too risqu√© with sexual references. Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over various elements of it but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege, he refused to make alterations. Roy E. Disney, head of Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt it was appropriate to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner. The film opened in the United States on June 22, 1988, grossing $11,226,239 in 1,045 theaters during its opening weekend, ranking first place in the domestic box office. It was Buena Vista's biggest opening weekend ever. It went on to gross $156,452,370 in North America and $173,351,588 internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $329,803,958. At the time of release, it was the 20th- highest-grossing film of all time. It was also the second-highest-grossing film of 1988, behind only Rain Man. The film was accompanied by the NFB short, The Cat Came Back. =Home media= The film was first released on VHS on October 12, 1989. A LaserDisc edition was also released. A DVD version was first available on September 28, 1999. On March 25, 2003, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released it as a part of the \\"Vista Series\\" line in a two-disc collection with many extra features including a documentary, Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit; a deleted scene in which a pig's head is \\"tooned\\" onto Eddie's; the three Roger Rabbit shorts, Tummy Trouble, Roller Coaster Rabbit, and Trail Mix-Up; as well as a booklet and interactive games. The only short on the 2003 VHS release was Tummy Trouble. The 2003 DVD release presents the film in Full Screen (1.33:1) on Disc 1 and Widescreen (1.85:1) on Disc 2. On March 12, 2013, the film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and DVD combo pack special edition for the film's 25th anniversary.

The opening scene upstages the movie that emerges from it,\\" he said. Corliss was mainly annoyed by the homages to the Golden Age of American animation. Animation legend Chuck Jones made a rather scathing attack on the film in his book Chuck Jones Conversations. Among his complaints, Jones accused Robert Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input and ruining the piano duel that both Williams and he storyboarded. = Accolades = The film won 3 competitive Academy Awards and a Special Achievement Award. It became the first live- action/animation hybrid film to win multiple Academy Awards since Mary Poppins in 1964. It won Academy Awards for Best Sound Effects Editing (Charles L. Campbell and Louis Edemann), Best Visual Effects and Best Film Editing. Other nominations included Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Elliot Scott; Set Decoration: Peter Howitt), Best Cinematography and Best Sound (Robert Knudson, John Boyd, Don Digirolamo and Tony Dawe). Richard Williams received a Special Achievement Academy Award \\"for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters\\". Roger Rabbit won the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, as well as Best Direction for Zemeckis and Special Visual Effects. Hoskins, Lloyd, and Cassidy were nominated for their performances, while Alan Silvestri and the screenwriters received nominations. The film was nominated for four categories at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards and won for Best Visual Effects. Roger Rabbit was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), while Hoskins was also nominated for his performance. The film also won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie. Legacy Who Framed Roger Rabbit marks the first time that Disney's Mickey Mouse and Warner Bros.' Bugs Bunny have ever officially appeared on-screen together. The critical and commercial success of the film rekindled an interest in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene, as well as the Disney Renaissance. In November 1988, a few months after the film's release, Roger Rabbit made his guest appearance in the live-action and animated television special broadcast on NBC called Mickey's 60th Birthday in which to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Mickey Mouse. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin.Stewart, p.88 Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced: Tummy Trouble was shown before Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown before Dick Tracy; and Trail Mix-Up was shown before A Far Off Place. The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy. In December 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". =Controversy= With the film's LaserDisc release, Variety first reported in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of Jessica Rabbit. While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the LaserDisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the LaserDisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers. Another frequently debated scene includes one in which Baby Herman extends his middle finger as he passes under a woman's dress and re-emerges with drool on his lip. Also, controversy exists over the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are playing a piano duel, and during his trademark ranting gibberish, it is claimed that Donald calls Daffy a \\"goddamn stupid nigger\\"; however, this is a misinterpretation, with the line from the script being \\"doggone stubborn little‚Äî.\\" =Legal issue= Gary K. Wolf, author of the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit?, filed a lawsuit in 2001 against The Walt Disney Company. He claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of \\"gross receipts\\" and merchandising sales. In 2002, the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf's claim. In its January 2004 ruling, the California Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of \\"gross receipts\\" in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term. The ruling vacated the trial court's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings. In a March 2005 hearing, Wolf estimated he was owed $7 million. Disney's attorneys not only disputed the claim but also said Wolf actually owed Disney $500,000‚Äì$1 million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit. Wolf won the decision in 2005, receiving between $180,000 and $400,000 in damages. =Proposed sequel= Spielberg discussed a sequel in 1989 with J. J. Abrams as writer and Zemeckis as producer. Abrams's outline was eventually abandoned. Nat Mauldin was hired to write a prequel titled Roger Rabbit: The Toon Platoon, set in 1941 to 1943. Similar to the previous film, Toon Platoon featured many cameo appearances by characters from The Golden Age of American Animation. It began with Roger Rabbit's early years, living on a farm in the midwestern United States. With human Ritchie Davenport, Roger travels west to seek his mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (his future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army, Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-Nazi Germany broadcasts. Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi-occupied Europe accompanied by several other Toons in their Army platoon. After their triumph, Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade, and Roger is finally reunited with his mother and father, Bugs Bunny. Mauldin later retitled his script Who Discovered Roger Rabbit. Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing Schindler's List. Eisner commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver. Although they kept Roger's search for his mother, Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger's inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer. One of the songs, \\"This Only Happens in the Movies\\", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler. Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance. Spielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks, while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers. Test footage for Who Discovered Roger Rabbit was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the toons completely converted to CGI; but this was dropped as the film's projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film. In March 2003, producer Don Hahn was doubtful about a sequel being made, arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation. \\"There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now.\\" In December 2007, Marshall stated that he was still \\"open\\" to the idea, and in April 2009, Zemeckis revealed he was still interested. According to a 2009 MTV News story, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project, and the animated characters would be in traditional two-dimensional, while the rest would be in motion capture. However, in 2010, Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand- drawn animated and live-action sequences will be filmed, just like in the original film, but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the toons handle will be done digitally. Also in 2010, Hahn, who was the film's original associate producer, confirmed the sequel's development in an interview with Empire. He stated, \\"Yeah, I couldn't possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you're a fan, pretty soon you're going to be very, very, very happy.\\" In 2010, Bob Hoskins stated he was interested in the project, reprising his role as Eddie Valiant. However, he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a year earlier, and died from pneumonia in 2014. Marshall has confirmed that the film is a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete. During an interview at the premiere of Flight, Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins' absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives. In February 2013, Gary K. Wolf, writer of the original novel, said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called The Stooge, based on the 1952 film of the same name. The proposed film is set to a prequel, taking place five years before Who Framed Roger Rabbit and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica. Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney. In November 2016, while promoting his film Allied in England, Zemeckis stated that the sequel \\"moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film, moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s\\". He also stated that the sequel would feature a \\"digital Bob Hoskins\\", as Eddie Valiant would return in \\"ghost form\\". While the director went on to state that the script is \\"terrific\\" and the film would still use hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green- lighting the sequel are \\"slim\\". As he explained more in detail, \\"The current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all\\". In December 2018, while promoting Welcome to Marwen, his latest film, and given the 30th anniversary of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Zemeckis reiterated in an interview with Yahoo! Movies that though the sequel's script is \\"wonderful\\", Disney is still unlikely to ever produce it, and he doesn't see the possibility of producing it as an original film for the streaming service Disney+, as he feels that it doesn't make any sense as there is no \\"Princess\\" in it.

Early life and education Fillmore was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, as the eldest of five children. In his youth he mastered piano, guitar, violin, flute, and slide trombone. He kept his trombone activities a secret at first, as his circumspect religious father James Henry Fillmore (1849‚Äì1936)‚Äîa composer of gospel songs, often in collaboration with Jessie Brown Pounds ‚Äîbelieved it an uncouth and sinful instrument. Henry's mother secretly bought a used trombone for him and obscured, from Henry's father, the son's learning to play the instrument. Fillmore, whose relative Frederick Augustus Fillmore (1856‚Äì1925) was also a tune-composer for gospel songs, was a singer for his church choir as a boy. He began composing at 18, with his first published march \\"Hingham\\", named after a line of brass instruments. Fillmore entered the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music in 1901. Personal life After graduating from the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, Fillmore traveled the United States as a circus bandmaster with his wife, an exotic vaudeville dancer named Mabel May Jones. They were married in St. Louis. Career In the 1920s Fillmore was back in Cincinnati conducting the Shriners Temple Band, which he turned into one of the best marching bands in the country. In 1938 Fillmore, after being advised by a physician that he had just a few months to live, retired to Miami, Florida. He went on, however, to prove the physician wrong. So Fillmore kept an active schedule rehearsing high school bands in Florida and composing marches. Henry Fillmore Band Hall, the rehearsal hall for many of the University of Miami's performing groups, acquired its name as a tribute to Fillmore's work in the band genre. His march \\"Orange Bowl\\" was written for Miami's Band of the Hour. Uncle Henry, as Fillmore was affectionately known to the members of the Band of the hour, also wrote the University of Miami's current official fight song ‚Äì \\"Miami U How-De- Doo\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060459/http://www.footballfightmusic.com/track/Miami_FL_- _Fight_Song_-_Miami_U_How-Dee-Doo.html His arrangement of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" is the traditional arrangement performed by the Florida State University Marching Chiefs. His march \\"Men of Florida\\" was composed for the bands at the University of Florida. He was given an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the University of Miami in 1956 in recognition of his career. Fillmore lived out the rest of his days in South Florida. =Music= Fillmore wrote over 250 pieces and arranged orchestrations for hundreds more. He published under a variety of pseudonyms, including Gus Beans, Harold Bennett, Ray Hall, Harry Hartley, Al Hayes, and Henrietta Moore. Only the name Will Huff caused any issues, as another Will Huff composed marches and resided in Fillmore's state. Fillmore used many pseudonyms throughout his career and was worried that flooding the market with music published under \\"Henry Fillmore\\" would dissuade others from purchasing his music. His pseudonyms are associate with grade, or difficulty level, or genre. In a 1953 interview with Jack H. Mahan, Fillmore explained his pseudonym uses: \\"Harold Bennett\\" was easy and non-progressive, if you can play one, you can play them all. \\"Al Hayes\\" was a little more difficult. \\"Will Huff\\" was a duplicate composer (Fillmore's \\"Will Huff\\" was usually easy grade). \\"Henry Fillmore\\" could be the easiest marches or the most difficult. \\"Harry Hartley\\" are all solos; cornet, trombone, and baritone that are easy grade with no triple-tonguing or cadenzas. Solos under other names are just incidental. \\"Henrietta Moore\\" is all twilight songs. While best known for march music and screamers, he also wrote waltzes, foxtrots, hymns, novelty numbers, and overtures. Fillmore's best-known compositions include: * \\"The President's March\\" (1956) * \\"The Footlifter\\" (1935) * \\"Americans We\\" (1929) * \\"Men of Ohio\\" (1921) * \\"The Man of the Hour\\" (1924) * \\"His Honor\\" (1934) * \\"The Klaxon\\" (1930) * \\"Lassus Trombone\\" (1915) * \\"(We're) Men of Florida\\" * \\"Military Escort\\" (1923) * \\"Mt. Healthy\\" (1916) * \\"The Crosley March\\" * \\"Noble Men\\" (1922) * \\"Orange Bowl March\\" (1939) * \\"Rolling Thunder March\\" (1916) * \\"The Circus Bee\\" (1908) * \\"King Karl King\\" (1957) Fillmore gained fame as the \\"Father of the Trombone Smear\\", writing a series of 15 novelty tunes featuring trombone smears called \\"The Trombone Family\\". A number of these have a strong ragtime influence. The tunes have subtitles printed on the parts, some of which reflect social and racial realities of the time. All of Fillmore's trombone rags are as follows: Music to Fillmore's popular \\"Trombone Family\\" series * \\"Miss Trombone (A Slippery Rag)\\" (1908) * \\"Teddy Trombone (A Brother to Miss Trombone)\\" (1911) * \\"Lassus Trombone (The Cullud Valet to Miss Trombone)\\" (1915) * \\"Pahson Trombone (Lassus Trombone's 'Ole Man')\\" (1916) * \\"Sally Trombone (Pahson Trombone's Eldest Gal Some Crow)\\" (1917) * \\"Slim Trombone (Sally Trombone's Cousin- the Jazzin' One Step Kid)\\" (1918) * \\"Mose Trombone (He's Slim Trombone's Buddy)\\" (1919) * \\"Shoutin' Liza Trombone (Mose Trombone's Ah-finity)\\" (1920) (Also known as \\"Hallelujah Trombone\\" for the quote from Handel's \\"Messiah\\") * \\"Hot Trombone (He's Jes a Fren' ob Shoutin' Liza Trombone)\\" (1921) * \\"Bones Trombone (He's Jes as Warm as Hot Trombone)\\" (1922) * \\"Dusty Trombone\\" (1923) * \\"Bull Trombone (A Cullud Toreador)\\" (1924) * \\"Lucky Trombone\\" (1926) * \\"Boss Trombone\\" (1929) * \\"Ham Trombone\\" (1929) Occasionally, as in \\"The Footlifter\\" credit, Fillmore wrote with the name Harold Bennett.

Looney Tunes animated short film, directed by Robert Clampett. The short was released on September 24, 1938, and stars Porky Pig. In 1994, Porky in Wackyland was voted No. 8 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. In 2000, it was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected the short for preservation in the National Film Registry. Plot Porky in Wackyland was inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2000, deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" A newspaper shows Porky Pig traveling to Africa to hunt the rare dodo bird, worth $4,000,000,000,000 p.s. 000,000,000 dollars. Porky uses his airplane to go to Dark Africa, then Darker Africa, and finally lands in Darkest Africa. When Porky lands, a sign tells him that he's in Wackyland (\\"Population: 100 nuts and a squirrel\\"), while a voice booms out \\"It can happen here!\\" Porky tiptoes along the ground in his airplane and he is greeted by a roaring beast, who suddenly becomes effeminate and dances away into the forest. He watches as the sun is lifted above the horizon by a tower of stacked creatures. Nearby, another creature rises out of a tall flower, playing \\"The William Tell Overture\\", using his nose as a flute. The creature launches into a wild drum solo, plays a tiny piano, and plays its nose like a horn, which brings out a group of odd creatures, including a rabbit dangling in midair from a swing that seems to be threaded through its own ears, a small creature wearing large female mannequin legs who encourages the rabbit to swing faster, a peacock with a fantail of cards, an upside-down creature walking with giant bare feet in his arms (replacing his hands) while wearing a hat on his legless rear end, a goofy-looking creature wearing large glasses in a small pot, a scooter-like creature, a creature with two steamboat pipes on his back, a four-legged creature with a waffle iron-like mouth, three fish swimming in midair (the first holding an umbrella, the second wearing an anchor, and the third with a periscope on its back), a round creature with long legs on its sides, and an angry criminal imprisoned behind a free- floating barred window that he holds in his hands while a small policeman on a wheel appears and hits him on the head with a large stick. As Porky tries to find the do-do, he comes across a duck singing \\"Mammy!\\", a horn-headed creature, a conjoined cat and dog hybrid creature spinning around like a tornado while they fight, and a 3 headed stooge whose heads argue and fight amongst themselves, but temporally stop their fight to tell the viewers that their mother was scared by a pawnbreaker's sign, while a small creature with a light bulb on its head translates their gibberish speech. Finally, the Dodo appears. Porky tries to catch it, but it plays tricks on him. The dodo pulls out a pencil and draws a door in mid-air, and instead of opening it and running through, reaches down and lifts up the bottom edge of the door like a curtain, darts underneath and lets it snap back into place for Porky to bump into. At another point, the do-do appears on the Warner Bros. shield logo and slingshots Porky into the ground. Afterwards, the dodo pulls a wall of bricks in the picture and lets him crash into it. Eventually, Porky triumphs when he disguises himself as a bearded paperboy, shouting \\"Extra! Extra! Porky captures Dodo!\\", before hitting the bird with a mallet. Porky loudly proclaims to the audience that he has captured the last dodo. The dodo mockingly replies, \\"Yes, I'm really the last of the dodos. Ain't I, fellas?\\". A multitude of dodos appear, all yelling out, \\"Yeah, man!\\". They and the Dodo all howl, which allows him to escape and stand on Porky's head. Reception Steve Schneider's 1998 That's All Folks! The Art of Warner Bros. Animation writes that with this short, \\"the lord of cartoon misrule, Clampett established conclusively that in animation, realism is irrelevant.\\" In the 2001 Masters of Animation, John Grant writes that \\"this short, in its cumulative effect, is more wildly inventive than anything even [Tex] Avery had produced for Warners.\\" Follow-ups and derivative works Identical moments from Porky in Wackyland and its color remake, Dough for the Do-Do. Much of the Wackyland sequence was adapted and reused by Clampett for inclusion in his 1943 short Tin Pan Alley Cats. A color remake of Porky in Wackyland was supervised by Friz Freleng in 1948. Re-titled as Dough for the Do-Do, the remake was released in 1949. The films were nearly identical, in many cases appearing to match frame-by-frame in certain details, albeit with Porky's appearance updated (by redoing most of the animation of the character), the voices having evolved (with less use of speeding-up) and all of the backgrounds being different. The following differences include: The backgrounds are more desert-like with different objects, including melting pocket watches inspired by Salvador Dal√≠'s The Persistence of Memory. During the beginning of Porky in Wackyland, a newspaper man arrives behind the title card, yelling \\"Extra! Extra! Porky off on dodo hunt!\\" before showing the paper to the camera (\\"Paper, mister?\\") In Dough for the Do-Do, this does not happen. The title card just fades to the newspaper already shown. In Porky in Wackyland, Porky shows a picture of the dodo in his airplane, after the newspaper is shown, but before cutting to his flight path across the globe and into \\"Darkest Africa\\". In Dough for the Do-Do, the newspaper is shown, then the scene cuts to Porky's flight path. In Porky in Wackyland, once in \\"Darkest Africa,\\" there is a dotted circular area labeled \\"?\\", which Porky circles clockwise before flying into. In Dough for the Do-Do, there is no such area, and once Porky crosses into \\"Darkest Africa,\\" he is shown landing. In Dough for the Do-Do, after the sun is risen (with the \\"Ranz des Vaches\\" part of the William Tell Overture playing in the background), it cuts straight to the scene with the black duck passing by Porky and saying \\"Mammy!\\" (an allusion to Al Jolson's blackface performances). When the horn-head passes by, the drum solo starts, then cuts straight to the creature rising out of the flower and playing a jazz tune on his nose. In Porky in Wackyland, we see the creature playing that part of the William Tell Overture on his nose, then starting the jazz tune. After the shot with the horn-head and Cat-Dog, we see the flower-creature bang the drums some more and ends it with banging a cymbal on his head, which makes him and his flower sink into the ground. This and Cat-Dog are cut from Dough for the Do-Do. In Porky in Wackyland, the flower- creature plays his nose like a horn. In Dough for the Do-Do, the horn-nose is colored differently from the rest of creature's body, making it seem like the horn is separate from the creature. There are a lot more jungle sound effects in Dough for the Do-Do. In Dough for the Do-Do, the long pan through Wackyland was used from Tin Pan Alley Cats. In Porky in Wackyland, the creature with large glasses had a pot, that showed the words \\"Treg's a Foo\\". In Dough for the Do-Do, the words were replaced with \\"ZOOT\\" in capital letters. The giant, three-dimensional \\"FOO\\" in the background is also replaced with \\"ZOOT\\". Also, in the remake, there are hardly any creatures that appear around the big words. In Porky in Wackyland, after the angry criminal yells for a while, a short policeman on a wheel appears and clangs the criminal on the head with an oversized nightstick. In Dough for the Do-Do, this does not happen. Instead, it cuts to a new scene, featuring a reanimated version of Rubber Band marching by (i.e. marching instruments made out of rubber bands) from Tin Pan Alley Cats, before cutting straight to the Three Stooges scene. In Porky in Wackyland, the three-headed Stooge creature arrives from behind an igloo. In Dough for the Do-Do, it arrives behind a large broken guitar. In Dough for the Do-Do, Moe has blond hair. In Porky in Wackyland, he has his original black hair. In Dough for the Do-Do, Porky is led by a wacky candle-stick-headed creature to the dodo. He falls through a hole, and is seen falling from the sky. However, the camera zooms out to reveal that the sky is a \\"special-effects\\" projector, rolled by the creature with the candle stick on his head. When he stops rolling, Porky lands on the ground, and he \\"toot- toots\\" like a train, before running away. In Porky in Wackyland, this does not happen; Porky just lands in a dish, after tumbling through a path in a black background then coming out of a large faucet like a drop of water. In Dough for the Do-Do, the dodo has a green neck and yellow legs. In Porky in Wackyland, the dodo's neck and legs are black. In Porky in Wackyland, the dodo screams twice: after he draws the imaginary door and before he pulls the wall of bricks. In Dough for the Do-Do, his screams are muted. In one scene before the ending of Dough for the Do-Do, Porky crashes into a wall of bricks. He pokes his head out of the pile, and the Do-Do drops an extra brick from above the clouds. Porky covers his head, panicked, until a parachute appears on the brick. Porky laughs in relief, until the brick opens up and releases a double, landing on Porky's head with a clang. In Porky in Wackyland, when Porky pokes his head out of the brick pile, another brick drops on his head from offscreen, causing him to cry in frustration. The major difference in storyline is the ending, starting at the scene of the dodo walking just after the brick wall scene. In Porky in Wackyland, the dodo finds Porky, disguised as a newspaper man, and the ending continues as described above in the plot section. In Dough for the Do-Do, Porky instead disguises himself as a dodo and tells the real dodo that he's the last dodo and is worth $6 trillion. The dodo handcuffs Porky and runs off with Porky to the left, saying that he has the last dodo and is rich, then Porky stops him, saying, \\"Oh n-n-no, you haven't! I'm rich! I got the last d-d-dodo!\\" as he removes his disguise and, still handcuffed to the dodo, runs off to the right and into the background. Once Porky and the dodo have left the scene, several other dodos emerge onto the scene, all together proclaiming, \\"Yes sir, he's got the last dodo!\\" Thus, unlike in Porky in Wackyland, Porky leaves completely unaware of any other dodos. In Porky in Wackyland, there is a sign that says \\"HELLO\\" upside-down above the creature with mannequin legs. In Dough for the Do-do, this doesn't happen. Instead it repeatedly says \\"Oh boy!\\" Dough for the Do-do is approximately 23 seconds shorter. Dough for the Do-Do was produced in Technicolor, but was originally released in Cinecolor due to a dispute with the Technicolor corporation. Later reissues were printed by Technicolor. There were at least two Terrytoons plagiarizations of Porky in Wackyland in the 1940s or 50's. Dingbat Land (1949) starred Gandy Goose and Sourpuss. The role of the Do-Do was taken by a minor Terrytoons character, Dingbat. The second film, a more direct plagiarization of the Porky Pig/Do-Do cartoons, starred a British hunter and a Do-Do stand-in. The creature didn't talk, but made strange hooting noises, and flung flames from a tuft of hair on top of its head. Tex Avery, for whom Clampett worked as an animator in the mid-1930s, borrowed strongly from this cartoon for his 1948 MGM cartoons Half-Pint Pygmy (in which the characters, George and Junior, travel to Africa in search of the world's smallest pygmy, only to discover that he has an uncle who's even smaller) and The Cat That Hated People (where the cat travels to the moon and encounters an array of characters similar to those in Clampett's Wackyland, e.g., a pair of gloves and lips that keep saying \\"Mammy, mammy\\", just like the Al Jolson duck in Porky in Wackyland). Clampett would again use the Three Stooges parody when a later creation of his, Beany and Cecil, faced the \\"Dreaded Three-Headed Threep\\". According to writer Paul Dini, the Do-Do Bird is the father of Gogo Dodo, a character on the 1990s animated TV series Tiny Toon Adventures. A small clip from the film was used in a Slappy Squirrel segment on another Warners animated TV series of the 1990s, Animaniacs. The segment, titled \\"Critical Condition\\", featured Porky in Wackyland as part of a fake LaserDisc release. The Do-Do Bird has made occasional guest spots in the DC Comics Looney Tunes comic book, being colored in grayscale as opposed to the rest of the art being in color. The character makes an appearance in the Wii game Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal as an unplayable character. He is given a first name, Yoyo the Dodo. Yoyo can also be seen as a brief cameo in the beginning of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The \\"dodo bird\\" in this cartoon bears more than a passing resemblance to the metal eating bird that appears in \\"It's A Bird\\", a stop-motion animation short by Charles Bowers. Animator Jeff Hale may have borrowed Wackyland and Dodo's concept of the main character in a strange world surrounded by strange creatures for a Sesame Street cartoon segment featuring a boy on a bicycle suddenly riding into a Wackyland-esque neighborhood filled with very odd creatures and things, making him think he's lost, until a strange man with a magic yoyo appears and gives him a clue how to find his way back home: \\"Try to remember all the things you passed/But when you go back, make the first thing the last.\\" The cat-dog hybrid seen in the cartoon might have been the basis for the Nicktoons character CatDog.

Its origins are those of European composers borrowing from the military music of the Ottoman Empire in place there from the 16th century. The American genre developed after the British model during the colonial and Revolutionary periods, then later as military ceremonials and for civilian entertainment events. One of the earliest exponents of march music in America and its preeminent champion was John Philip Sousa, \\"The March King\\"; who revolutionized and standardized American march music during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of his most famous marches‚Äî\\"Semper Fidelis\\", \\"The Washington Post\\", \\"The Liberty Bell March\\", and \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\"‚Äîare among the best known of historical American music and are especially revered by many Americans for their rousing strains and patriotic themes. His \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" features what is arguably the most famous piccolo obligato in all of music. Other notable American composers of march music include Henry Fillmore ‚Äì \\"The Circus Bee\\"; Charles A. Zimmerman ‚Äì \\"Anchors Aweigh\\"; W. Paris Chambers ‚Äì \\"Sweeney's Cavalcade\\"; Edwin E. Bagley ‚Äì \\"National Emblem March\\"; Meredith Willson ‚Äì \\"Seventy-six Trombones\\"; and George Gershwin ‚Äì \\"Strike Up the Band\\". Composers (from Europe or elsewhere) of march music popular in the US include: Johann Strauss Sr ‚Äì \\"Radetzky March\\"; Kenneth J. Alford ‚Äì \\"Colonel Bogey March\\"; Julius Fucik ‚Äì \\"Entry of the Gladiators\\"; Edward Elgar ‚Äì \\"Pomp and Circumstance (No. 1)\\". The forms of American march music typically are of three categories: the military march form, the regimental march form, and a general group containing recapitulation marches, \\"four-step\\" marches, and other diverse forms. All marches have at least three common elements, including: different (i.e., contrasting) sections called strains; several different melodies; and a \\"trio\\" section of strains/\\"repeats\\" that offers pronounced contrasts in phrasing. Most American marches use (seemingly) simple chord progressions, but‚Äîusing chromatic harmonies, sevenths extensions, and secondary dominants‚Äîcomposers often complicated their marches with interesting chords and rapid chord changes. History The true \\"march music era\\" succeeded in the United States from the 1850s to the 1920s, and persisted through the 1940s as it slowly became shadowed by the coming of jazz in the U.S. Earlier marches by Handel, Mozart, and Beethoven tended to be parts of symphonies or movements in suites. Despite its age and history and its popular performance in the U.S., European march music generally is not thought of as typically American music. =Marches and the military band= The origins of European and American march music can be traced to the military music of the Ottoman Empire. The martial purposes of the music was to regulate army movements in the field by signalling orders, and to keep time during marching and maneuvers. The extensive use of percussion, especially cymbals, was also for psychological effect as, early on, their use was unknown in Western Europe and had the capacity to frighten opponents. (Indeed, the subsequent adoption of such percussive instruments in European 'classical' music was by direct import from the Ottomans.) Europeans were first exposed to march music in the early 18th century, and interest continued to build into the 1800s when a vogue for Turkish marching bands swept through Europe. Pieces displaying the Turkish influence can be found in the works of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven, with a notable example being \\"Turkish March\\" by Beethoven (part of Op. 113: Overture and incidental music for Die Ruinen von Athen). It was apparently during the latter gunpowder age that military march music was developed for armies to support troop morale by marching with music playing, whether from the melody of a fife or the beat of a drum, or both. American march music developed during the American Revolution and earlier colonial conflicts, in which a fife and snare drum would play while troops marched to battle. Thus it is said that march music is a military music. The tradition of formed lines of soldiers marching into battle with music playing ended soon after the American Civil War in the mid 19th century; military bands continued to perform marches during ceremonial events, which spawned a new tradition of playing marches as a source of entertainment. =Marches and the concert band= During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many U.S. towns, organizations, theaters, and even companies aspired to have their own band. These so-called community/concert bands performed at scheduled parades and concerts and played at impromptu events such as the popular gazebo concerts. Published marches were plentiful due to prolific American composers like John Philip Sousa, Karl L. King, and Henry Fillmore. Marches became a staple in the repertoire of these concert bands, explaining in part how the popularity of march music spread so rapidly across the country. =Marches and the circus= Marches were also popularized during this period by circus bands. The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circuses presented their bands performing live march music. Typically, they played a special variety of marches known descriptively as screamers, two- steps, and cakewalks. These tunes served to energize the crowd and focus attention on the circus acts being performed. =Marches and the marching band= The march music era in the U.S. saw the development of college and high school marching bands, which typically were organized to perform march music during half-time shows and pep-rallies. Composers often dedicated marches to a favored university band. John Philip Sousa American composer John Philip Sousa revolutionized American march music. His prolific production of quality marches greatly advanced the genre's popularity. According to researcher Paul Bierley, Sousa's marches were known for their simplicity and understatement with rousing counterpoint and overall energy. Sousa standardized the military march form in America, see below. His marches are typically marked by a \\"subdued\\" trio‚Äîas in \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\", where most of the performing band becomes subordinated to arguably the most famous piccolo obligato in all of music. Sousa's magnum opus, \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" was adopted in 1987 as the national march of the United States. Sousa was prolific as both composer and orchestrator, writing 137 marches and more than 80 significant pieces, including operettas, overtures, suites, dances, and fantasies, and publishing some 322 arrangements of nineteenth-century western European symphonic works. He directed the design and production of his namesake instrument, the sousaphone, for its specialized adaption for use in a marching band. For its ease of carry and its forward- directed sound, the sousaphone is widely employed in marching bands and other musical venues. Notable march composers in the United States Most march composers were from the United States or Europe. Publishing new march music was most popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries; sponsors of the genre began to diminish after that time.

Only a few marches are written otherwise (usually in 4/4 time), while still using the same two beats per measure tempo (see below). Several meters are used in marches, as follows: * time is called \\"cut- time\\", indicated by the symbol . (This means common time cut-in-half, hence the name \\"cut-time\\"). Marches written in cut-time have a clear upbeat/downbeat feel, which in layman's terms, means a strong \\"oom-pah\\" sound is heard. Many cut-time marches use heavy syncopation to create rhythmic interest. Because passing tones in most cases are shorter than marches in a different meter, cut-time marches tend to sound faster. An example of a cut-time march is \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" by Sousa. * time marches are played \\"in two\\", meaning the dotted quarter-note gets the beat and there are two of them in a measure. time is used when the composer wants a \\"triplet\\" feel in the beat; that is, marches produce a more dance-like, swing beat that is more prominent and exaggerated than its cut-time cousin. A march can be recognized immediately by its common \\"da-bah-da-bah\\" or \\"DA-da-DA-da\\" sound. An example of a march is \\"The Washington Post March\\", also by Sousa. * time is much like cut-time, except fewer notes appear in a measure, as here the quarter-note gets the beat instead of the half-note; but there are still only two beats per measure. Marches in time typically are written for the performer as it is easier to read at faster tempos. Many European marches are written in , and almost all American galops as well. Galops are played at a very fast tempo, sounding as if there was one beat to the bar. * time marches are rare. However, some slow marches such as dirges use it. Robert Jager uses in his quick march \\"Stars and Bars\\". =Tempo= The tempo of marches varies significantly. While most bands perform marches in their own tempo, most marches are quick (faster than a waltz, as fast as or slower than a polka). As alluded to before, most march composers did not designate a specific tempo on their manuscripts. However, that is not to say the march music composer is random with his/her tempo while conducting the march. For example, John Philip Sousa conducted his marches using around 120 beats per minute. Most European march composers, however, conducted their marches in a slower style, using around 100 beats per minute. There are, however, many and notable exceptions: see concert march and screamer. =Key= For the sake of band performers, especially altos, marches are typically written in flat keys. The keys of Concert F, B‚ô≠, E‚ô≠, and A‚ô≠ are the most frequently used. (NOTE: These refer to the key the march in, not the modulated key in the trio (see below)). =March music forms= Most marches follow a fairly strict structure known as the march music form, the origins of which appear to be derived from the sonata form, as these two forms share similar ideas of contrasting sections. The period of early development of the true march music form denotes the start of the march music era in the US by the 1850s; eventually the form was standardized by John Philip Sousa. While the form varies among different styles of march music, all marches have these common elements: *Different sections, called strains. *Several separate melodies. *A section, dubbed the trio, that is devoted to contrasts in phrasing. Following are descriptions of various march forms that have been popular and are/were frequently used by march music composers. Military march form \\"Blaze Away! March\\" by Abe Holzmann, written in military march format. The military march form is largely credited to John Philip Sousa, who came to be known as \\"The March King\\". He standardized the \\"military\\" form (as compared to the \\"regimental\\" form), using it in over half of his marches. The military march form is: I-AA-BB-C(C)-Br-C- Br-C(Grandioso); or, in more generic code: I-AA-BB-CCDCDC. The first section of a military march is called the introduction (I) or fanfare; it is typically 4, 8, or 16 bars long and played in marcato style, using forte (loud) dynamics and chromatic alterations to catch the attention of the listener. The introduction is usually the shortest section of a march and is almost never omitted. Still, examples of marches written without an intro include \\"Bugles and Drums\\" and \\"The Footlifter\\". Introductions to marches vary but some standard practices include: (a) tutti unison (\\"The Washington Post\\"), (b) tutti rhythmic unison with contrary motion (\\"The Thunderer\\"), (c) tutti rhythm unison in four-part harmony (\\"Semper Fi\\"), and (d) four-part independent (\\"The Klaxon\\"). The introduction is commonly based on the dominant key to create clarity of key as centered in the first strain, (see harmonic progressions below). Generally, the intro is not repeated, but it is in some marches: \\"Bravura\\", \\"The Rifle Regiment\\", and \\"Washington Grays\\". The introduction generally starts in major because marches typically are in major keys, but there are marches with introductions in minor keys, including \\"Gladiator\\", \\"The Picadore\\", \\"Nobles of the Mystic Shrine\\", and \\"Rolling Thunder\\". The next section is commonly called the first strain, as it is the first prominent melody of the march. The first strain is typically 8 or 16 bars long with 4-measure phrases. The first strain can be in either major or minor mode and can use any variety of dynamics, instrumentation and modulations. Typically this strain utilizes similar motifs (as opposed to contrasting motifs‚Äîsee trio, below) in its phrasing, and it sounds more rhythmically straightforward than the following section. After the first playing of the strain, it is repeated once, sometimes with added parts such as counter-melodies. The first strain may be repeated yet again after the second strains, particularly if it (first strain) is in minor. Karl L. King frequently arranged this style, as did Henry Fillmore with his trombone smears. Examples include \\"Peacemaker March\\", \\"New York Hippodrome\\", \\"Caravan Club March\\", \\"Trombone King\\", \\"Lassus Trombone\\", \\"Royal Decree\\", and Price's \\"March of Youth\\". The second strain is usually 16 bars long and is the second primary melody of the march. However, in marches like \\"Solid Men to the Front\\", and Sousa's Untitled March, the second strain is 32 bars in length. Some marches commonly play the first run of the second strain quietly and the second run loudly; these include: \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\", \\"His Honor\\", \\"The Washington Post\\", \\"Hands Across the Sea\\", \\"On the Mall\\", and others, particularly by Sousa. The second strain may use somewhat different instrumentation or may alter the relative dynamics of the different parts. The melody is normally played with the basses, i.e., the low brass and low woodwinds). This strain typically uses 4-measure phrases, but with greatly varied motifs, which causes the melodies to sound more \\"stretched out\\". For example, many marches use more whole notes in the second strain than the first‚Äîas can be heard in \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". Like the first, the second strain is usually repeated once, sometimes twice; but some marches, including \\"Emblem of Freedom\\", \\"Cyrus the Great\\" and the \\"Melody Shop\\", omit this repeat. =The trio and repeats= In some marches, a short introduction to the trio is heard, often a repeat of the opening introduction, or it may be a different melody played by the whole band, a fanfare by the brasses‚Äîor a percussion soli (drum roll-off) as heard in \\"Semper Fidelis\\" by Sousa. Another example of a trio introduction is found in \\"Twin Eagle Strut\\" by Zane Van Auken. The third (or technically fourth or fifth) primary melody in a march is called the trio, which usually is the main melody of the march. It typically is played legato style in a softer dynamic and features woodwinds more than brass. Sousa often used clarinets and euphoniums in lower tenor register in his trios. This trio strain is the most contrasting of the sections, often containing variations of motifs heard in the previous two strains. The trio melody may be repeated once at a softer dynamic, or may not be repeated at all. Typically, it is played quietly for the first or second playthrough, then features piccolos (or flutes, or other woodwinds) playing over the trio melody. In almost all cases the trio now modulates to the subdominant key of the march, meaning one flat is added to the key signature. The key is now flatter and this repeat will, with softer instrumentation, offer a relaxing feel from the previous volume. The contrast makes the trio more memorable as the new key is maintained to the end of the strain. (For marches starting in minor keys, the trio usually modulates to the relative major.) Next comes the breakstrain or breakup strain (sometimes called the dogfight or interlude), making it the fourth melody heard. This strain is loud, intense, and marcato. Its purpose can be found in its title, as it literally breaks a gap between the trio sections, providing contrast to the usually softer trio melodies and generating excitement for the listener. Most breakstrains resemble a conversation between the upper woodwinds and the low brass. The final measures typically contain tension-building chords or chromatic motifs. The breakstrain is usually 16 bars long, as in the case of \\"Hands Across the Sea\\", but marches vary: \\"The Washington Post\\" and \\"The Interlochen Bowl\\" have eight-bar breakstrains, where \\"On the Mall\\" and \\"The Purple Pageant\\" have 12-bar, and \\"The Thunderer\\" has a 15-bar breakstrain. \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" has a 24-bar breakstrain. After the breakstrain, the trio is repeated again. The trio after the breakstrain is usually played in the same style as the first, but sometimes counter-melodies or obbligatos are added to these latter runs of the trio. Now the breakstrain is played again and the march moves to the final trio. The final trio is known as the grandioso, trio grandioso or trio, which typically, as the grand finale, is played through much more loudly than previous runs of the trio. It sometimes adds yet another counter-melody or obligato (such as the one in \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\") and uses all instrumental sections of the band, bringing everything to a close. The grandioso is the most exciting section of the march; its role is to make the trio melody memorable to the listener. =The stinger= The last measure of the march sometimes contains a stinger, a I chord played in unison on the upbeat after a quarter rest. Most, but not all, marches carry a stinger. \\"Semper Fidelis\\" is a famous march that does not have an ending stinger when not recapitulated back to the beginning of the march (see below). Most marches end at forte volume (loud); one that does not is Sousa's \\"Manhattan Beach\\", which ends fading away. In some military marches, such as \\"U.S. Field Artillery March\\" (the \\"Caissons Song\\") by John Philip Sousa, there is only one \\"playing\\" (or run) of the breakstrain, resulting in only two playings of the trio. Apart from \\"On the Mall\\", \\"the Chimes of Liberty\\", and a couple of others, Goldman's marches in the military form had only two playings (two runs) of the trio. Examples of military marches include \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" by John Philip Sousa, \\"Barnum and Bailey's Favorite\\" by Karl L. King, and \\"On the Mall\\" by Edwin F. Goldman Regimental march form The regimental march form as developed in the US is perhaps older than the military form; it is also called the \\"review march\\". There are some key differences between the two styles. The regimental march form is: I-AA-BB-CC-DD The introduction, first strain, and second strain are typically that of a military march, but some use a longer (or much longer) introduction. After the trio the regimental march follows with a strain (D) instead of a breakstrain. This new strain also uses a modulated key and typically relates to the second strain; it is almost always repeated once. The regimental march is considerably shorter than a military march for lack of a third repeat of the trio and breakstrain; thus, it is preferred for performances by marching bands in parades‚Äîhence the name \\"review march\\". Examples of regimental marches include Sousa's \\"Semper Fidelis\\" (when not recapitulated back to the beginning of the march ‚Äì see below), \\"Men of Ohio\\" by Henry Fillmore, \\"Bugles and Drums\\" by Goldman, and \\"Robinson's Grand Entry\\" by Karl L. King. Other forms and styles Some earlier marches presented a simple, \\"four-part\\", form: I-AA-BB-CC. Typically those marches, having neither a breakstrain nor 'D' section, were written for marching bands or youth bands. The piece was ended by simply playing one repeat of the trio, usually in the grandioso style. Examples include \\"Our Director\\" by F.E. Bigelow and \\"Gallant Marines\\" by Karl L. King. Henry Fillmore and Karl King often used the four-part style in their marches. Sousa rarely used this style. Sousa's marches of the early 1890s (including \\"High School Cadets\\" and \\"Manhattan Beach\\"), used an introduction unique to his career. Many earlier American and European marches, using either the four-part or the regimental form, recapitulate back to the beginning of the march. Typically, after completing the final trio (or 'D' section), the march is re-started; repeats are ignored, and the piece is ended after the second strain. Codas are rare, but sometimes used; examples: \\"Riders for the Flag\\" by Sousa and \\"Children of the Shrine\\" by James Swearingen. The tradition of writing recapitulating marches ended near the start of the American march music era. John Philip Sousa abandoned this technique except with his march \\"On Parade\\"‚Äîone of his few circus marches. Victor Herbert was one of the last American composers to write recapitulating marches. Examples include \\"Under the Double Eagle\\" by Wagner and \\"The Serenade\\" by Victor Herbert. =Phrasing= The basic (and vague) definition of a march describes a piece of music based upon a regular, repeated drum or rhythmic pattern‚Äîwhich means a march is most recognizable by its phrasing. Almost all quickstep marches consist of four-measure, or four- bar, phrases typically ending with a whole note (that either creates or resolves melodic tension, see chord progression), followed by a pickup note. Thus it is said that this \\"basic\\" framework is what makes marches melodically \\"pleasing\\". Some marches have more noticeable phrases than others. Marches by Karl King have very clear-cut phrases with distinctive whole notes and pickups. In contrast, John Philip Sousa used practically seamless phrasing. =Chords and harmonic progression= The harmonic progressions of American march music are well-grounded in the archetypal harmonic techniques of the times in which they were written. In summary, most American marches use seemingly simple chord progressions for the sake of creating a melodically pleasing sound, however composers often complemented their marches with interesting chords and rapid chord changes‚Äîusing chromatic harmonies, sevenths extensions, and secondary dominants. A detailed discussion of chord progressions follows. (Recommended reading in conjunction with these details: Chord progression and Scale degree.) Here is code for the chord progressions of the first strain of \\"Semper Fidelis\\" by John Philip Sousa. Note, each bar pair (e.g., G7), represents one of a total of 16 measures. *G7G7CCG7G7CCG7G7CCG7/BGGD7G7 The first strain begins with a very simple V-I progression (see chord progression basics), creating a wave-like sense of tension and relief within the chord. The use of dominant seven chords makes the V chord stronger and is used in many marches. In the middle of the measure, before the trumpet \\"fanfare\\", the chord alters to C‚ôØdim7 instead of remaining on C. This leads to a G7 chord (rather than to a D minor chord), and is an example of a common-tone diminished seventh chord. This chord leads into the V chord (G), then to a D7 chord. Here a D chord in the key of C would be the ii chord (as all ii chords must be minor). But the D chord here is not minor. Rather, it is known as a \\"secondary dominant\\", i.e., a dominant chord borrowed from different key. (A secondary dominant naturally leads into a chord other than the first (or I chord); here it leads into the V (G7)). Here is code for chord progressions of the second strain. *CFG7CCG7G7CCG7CFE7AmA‚ô≠7CCGC As with most second strains of march music, rapidly changing chords are featured: a legacy of Sousa. The IV chord is used here in marches to create an \\"uplifting\\" and lyrical sound which tends either to resolve back to the I chord‚Äîor to proceed into the V chord, as it does here. At the tenth measure, (FE7), which restates the main theme, Sousa uses a \\"deceptive\\" chord change. Instead of using F to G7 to C (as in measures two and three), the chord goes from the IV (F) to V7/VI (i.e., E7), to the VI (Am). The main melodic theme uses the same notes, but revolves around a different harmonic progression. Sousa then uses his trademark chromatic-accented chord A‚ô≠7, (a half-step below the previous chord) to create a \\"wall of tension\\" that quickly resolves into the I chord. Another chromatic-accented chord change often used by march music composers is inverting a I chord with a lowered third and raised fifth. For example, an E major chord (the I in the key of E) would be followed by a B major chord, (which is an E chord with a lowered third and raised fifth). Unlike secondary or \\"borrowed\\" dominants, this chord does not have logical harmonic functions other than to add texture and interest. Difficulty of performance The actual difficulty of performance varies considerably among marches. When first being written for grade school bands then being organized throughout the country, most marches were fairly modest in difficulty. Soon however, there were composers writing scores for (their own) bands that required professional to almost virtuosic skill to perform‚Äîsome composers noting that any given march might be difficult to play \\"perfectly\\", that is, with all the correct expressions and articulations and with steady tempo. A grading system of difficulty of performance as adapted from Norman Smith's \\"March Music Notes\\" follows. *Grade 1: Minimum difficulty. Suited for beginner bands first approaching music; may be a simple etude or ditty from an instructional book. *Grade 2: Also for beginner bands, but more developed, using different notes and rhythms. Instrumental ranges are comfortable, most requiring minimal endurance. Some scores follow the standard march form, but most are abbreviated, or of a simpler concert march form. *Grade 3: At standard march difficulty. Usually in full march form, and requiring moderate technique and endurance skills. Instrumental ranges are usually intermediate, and likely containing chromatic notes, obbligatos, and counter-melodies. Many parade marches contain Grade 3 scoring, examples being \\"The Thunderer\\" and \\"The National Emblem\\". *Grade 4: Moderately difficult, containing many technically challenging parts and some syncopation. This grade requires a considerable amount of practice/rehearsal of most high school bands; and typically requires a disciplined, complete ensemble for proper performance, as it contains intricate harmonies and counter-melodies. Example scores of this difficulty are \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" and \\"Barnum and Bailey's Favorite\\". *Grade 5: Considerably difficult; usually originally written for professional or virtuoso players such as those in a circus band, as screamers are typical of this grade. Grade 5s contain woodwind obbligatos or chromatic runs and will test the range of any player; they have very quick tempos, as well as complicated rhythms and syncopation. Example marches are \\"Entry of the Gladiators\\", \\"Washington Grays\\", and \\"Battle of Shiloh\\". *Grade 6: A rare difficulty. Usually found in greater works such as a symphonies, which typically contain mixed meters and intricate rhythms and harmonies. Instrumentation A 'correct' general description of the original instrumentation of (American) march bands is unlikely, as these bands were extremely varied through the 19th and early 20th centuries and most march music was written by composers for their own bands. Thus, almost all bands accumulated marches in repertoire that were written for their specific instrumentation. On the other hand, marches were also written for specific instrumentation to be determined \\"locally\\". That is, composers simply wrote a piano version of a march which was given to the publisher to arrange the different parts for concert or marching band, or orchestra, etc. Still, modern repertoire and arrangements are typically scored for: *C piccolo *C flute *oboe *bassoon *B clarinet *E alto clarinet *B bass clarinet *E alto saxophone *B tenor saxophone *E baritone saxophone *Trumpet in B *Cornet *Euphonium *French horn (in F) *Trombone *Tuba *Timpani *Keyboard instrument (usually glockenspiel) *Snare drum *Bass drum *Crash cymbals =Assignments and roles of instrument sections= Generally, the several instrument sections of an American march band serve the various roles of performing a typical march as follows: *Trumpets and cornets almost always carry the melody. They also may be scored various \\"flourishes\\" and \\"calls\\" for effect. *Clarinets, flutes, and piccolos also carry the melody, and are assigned obbligatos and other integral lines. *The tubas and other basses usually carry the bassline, providing the \\"oom\\" of the \\"oom-pah\\" sound of cut time marches (see French horns, below); they also provide the tonal foundation of the march, and assist to control volume and tempo. *French horns almost always carry the rhythmic backup of a march. For example, in cut time marches, they are typically assigned upbeats to provide the \\"pah\\" for the stylistic \\"oom-pah\\" sound. In 6/8 marches, French horns play on: beat 1, the li of 1, beat 2, and the li of 2, (or, 1‚Äìla‚Äìli‚Äì2‚Äìla‚Äìli, see solmization); thus, the measure is one eighth note, then an eighth rest, then two eighth notes, an eighth rest, then a final eighth note. *The euphonium often carries the melody, as in the trio of \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\", and may be assigned other roles.

Political forces within the realm are such that, in order for the king to retain the crown, his coronation must proceed. Fortuitously, an English gentleman on holiday in Ruritania who resembles the monarch is persuaded to act as his political decoy in an effort to save the unstable political situation of the interregnum. A sequel, Rupert of Hentzau, was published in 1898 and is included in some editions of The Prisoner of Zenda. The popularity of the novels inspired the Ruritanian romance genre of literature, film, and theatre that features stories set in a fictional country, usually in Central or Eastern Europe,John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, p. 826 for example Graustark from the novels of George Barr McCutcheon, and the neighbouring countries of Syldavia and Borduria in the Tintin comics. Plot summary On the eve of the coronation of King Rudolf V of Ruritania, his younger half-brother Michael, Duke of Strelsau, has him drugged. The unconscious king is abducted and imprisoned in a castle in the small town of Zenda. There are complications, plots, and counterplots, among them the schemes of Michael's mistress, Antoinette de Mauban, and those of his dashing but villainous henchman, Count Rupert of Hentzau. In a desperate attempt to deny Michael the excuse to claim the throne, Colonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim, attendants of the king, persuade his distant cousin Rudolf Rassendyll, an English visitor, to impersonate the king for the coronation. Rassendyll falls in love with Princess Flavia, the king's betrothed, but cannot tell her the truth. He determines to rescue the king and leads an attempt to enter the castle of Zenda. The king is rescued and is restored to his throne, but the lovers, trapped by duty, must part. Adaptations The novel has been adapted many times, mainly for film but also stage, musical, operetta, radio, and television. Probably the best-known version is the 1937 Hollywood movie. The dashingly villainous Rupert of Hentzau has been interpreted by such matinee idols as Ramon Novarro (1922), Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. (1937), and James Mason (1952). =Stage= * The Prisoner of Zenda (1895‚Äì96) was adapted for the stage from Hope's novel by Edward Rose.

Homages Many subsequent fictional works can be linked to The Prisoner of Zenda; indeed, this novel spawned the genre known as Ruritanian romance. What follows is a shortlist of those homages with a clear debt to Anthony Hope's book. * The 1902 short story \\"Rupert the Resembler\\" is one of the so-called New Burlesques, a comedy parody by Bret Harte. * E. Phillips Oppenheim's 1920 book The Great Impersonation (filmed in 1921, 1935 and 1942) makes use of the look-alike plot, this time between an English aristocrat and a German spy. *The Mad King, serialized in 1914 and 1915 and published in book form in 1926, was Edgar Rice Burroughs's version of the Ruritanian romance. Set in Europe immediately before and during World War I, his story differs from the Hope books in a number of details, though sharing much of their basic plot. He wrote one other story in the genre, 1918's The Rider, in which a prince and bandit exchange identities. * Dornford Yates acknowledged Hope's influenceB-Berry and I Look Back, Dornford Yates, Ward Lock 1958, p. 148 in his two novels Blood Royal (1929) and Fire Below a.k.a. By Royal Command (1930) which were set in the Ruritania-like Principality of Riechtenburg. * The plot of Dorothy Sayers's Have His Carcase (1932) revolves around an avid reader of Ruritanian romances who believed himself a descendant of Russian royalty. * The plot of John Buchan's The House of the Four Winds (1935) is transparently a homage to The Prisoner of Zenda * The Magnificent Fraud (1939): a Robert Florey film starring Akim Tamiroff where an American actor impersonates the assassinated president of a South American republic. * Edmond Hamilton's 1947 Space Opera novel The Star Kings reuses several Zenda subplots for a high adventure yarn not unlike the much later Star Wars franchise. * Robert A. Heinlein adapted the Zenda plot line to his science fiction novel Double Star (1956) with great success * John Osborne's play The Blood of the Bambergs (1962) turns the plot into a satire on royal weddings. * The 1965 comedy film The Great Race included an extended subplot that parodies Zenda, including a climactic fencing scene between Leslie Gallant (Tony Curtis) and Baron Rolfe von Stuppe (Ross Martin). While Curtis's character performs the heroics, it is Jack Lemmon who plays the dual role as the drunken crown prince and Professor Fate, his reluctant impersonator. * The Rip Kirby comic strip used the plot as the basis for one story. * Two episodes of the spoof spy television series Get Smart, \\"The King Lives?\\" and \\"To * Sire With Love, Parts 1 and 2\\", parodied the 1937 movie version, with Don Adams affecting Ronald Colman's accent. * The 1970 novel Royal Flash by George MacDonald Fraser purports to explain the real story behind The Prisoner of Zenda, and indeed, in an extended literary conceit, claims to be the inspiration for Hope's novel‚Äîthe narrator of the memoirs, in the framing story, tells his adventures to his lawyer, Hawkins, who can be assumed to be Anthony Hope. Otto von Bismarck and other real people such as Lola Montez are involved in the plot. It was adapted as the film Royal Flash in 1975, directed by Richard Lester, starring Malcolm McDowell as Flashman and Oliver Reed as Bismarck. * The Doctor Who serial The Androids of Tara (1978) had as a working title The Androids of Zenda and used a similar plot and setting. It featured Tom Baker as the Doctor and Mary Tamm in four roles: Romana and Princess Strella, and android doubles of each. The 1980 novelisation was by Terrance Dicks, who was script-editor on the 1984 BBC serialisation of Zenda. * \\"The Prisoner of Zen\\" (1979) by Peter Godfrey. Ruritanian farce exploring Zen themes in an occidental context. Produced by The Rational Theatre Company, the play toured the UK in 1979 and 1980. * The Zenda Vendetta (TimeWars Book 4) by Simon Hawke (1985) is a science-fiction version, part of a series which pits 27th-century terrorists the Timekeepers against the Time Commandos of the US Army Temporal Corps. The Timekeepers kill Rassendyll so that the Time Commando Finn Delaney is sent back to impersonate the impersonator, both to ensure that history follows its true path and to defeat the terrorists. In the finale, the Time Commandos assault Zenda Castle with lasers and atomic grenades, both to rescue the king and to destroy the Timekeepers base. * Moon over Parador (1988), adapted by Leon Capetanos and directed by Paul Mazursky. More directly a remake of The Magnificent Fraud, the story is set in Latin America with Richard Dreyfus as the President and as the actor Jack Noah, Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann (the \\"Black Michael\\" character), and Sonia Braga as Madonna Mendez (the Flavia character). It is a romantic comedy. * The 1992 Adventures in Odyssey episode \\"An Act of Nobility\\" is a whole plot reference to The Prisoner of Zenda. * Dave, a 1993 film version adapted by Gary Ross and directed by Ivan Reitman that places the story in contemporary Washington, D.C., with Kevin Kline as the President and as his double, Frank Langella in the \\"Black Michael\\" role, and Sigourney Weaver as the modern American Flavia. Like Moon Over Parador, it is a romantic comedy. * John Spurling's novel After Zenda (1995) is a tongue-in-cheek modern adventure in which Karl, the secret great-grandson of Rudolf Rassendyll and Queen Flavia, goes to post-Communist Ruritania, where he gets mixed up with various rebels and religious sects before ending up as constitutional monarch. * The Prisoner of Zenda, Inc., a 1996 made-for-television version, is set in the contemporary United States and revolves around a high school boy who is the heir to a large corporation. The writer, Rodman Gregg, was inspired by the 1937 film version. It stars Jonathan Jackson, Richard Lee Jackson, William Shatner, Don S.

The remainder of the trilogy gives the star-crossed lovers resolution, without negating the original Zenda ending.

Legacy In a popular but very questionable account, a German circus acrobat named Otto Witte claimed he had been briefly mistaken for the new King of Albania at the time of that country's separation from the Ottoman Empire, and that he was crowned and reigned a few days. However, the date of this claim (1913), and the lack of any evidence to back it up, suggest that Witte made up his story after seeing the first film version of the novel. Author Salman Rushdie cited The Prisoner of Zenda in the epigraph to Haroun and the Sea of Stories, the novel he wrote while living in hiding in the late 1980s. The novel has been part of the syllabus of higher secondary schools in Pakistan for over three decades.

The Donald Duck universe is a fictional shared universe which is the setting of stories involving Disney cartoon character Donald Duck, as well as Daisy Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Scrooge McDuck, and many other characters. The world is a part of the Mickey Mouse universe, but is more detailed. Life in the Donald Duck universe centers on the city of Duckburg, usually located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota, analogous to Northern California. The world also incorporates several other real and fictional locations, as well as historical figures and a fictional timeline, which is followed with varying degrees of consistency. Disney comics are the primary medium for Donald Duck stories. Contributors include Americans Carl Barks, Ted Osborne, Don Rosa, Tony Strobl, Al Taliaferro, and William Van Horn, as well as Italians Giovan Battista Carpi, Marco Rota, and Romano Scarpa. Other media includes short films in the Donald Duck series, children's books such as Little Big Books and Little Golden Books, television series such as DuckTales (1987‚Äì1991), Darkwing Duck (1991‚Äì1992), and the Ducktales reboot (2017‚ÄìPresent), and video games such as QuackShot (1991), Goin' Quackers (2000), and DuckTales: Remastered (2013). \\"Donald Duck universe\\" is not an official Disney term, but is sometimes used by fans. Don Rosa has also used the terms Barks Universe and Italian Duck Universe to describe different versions of the world's continuity. The terms \\"Barksian\\" or \\"Barksian facts\\" has also been used to describe the canon of the Donald Duck universe, as many comic book creators and fans only consider the stories by Carl Barks as factual, since he is the creator of many of its major characters, locations and ideas. Don Rosa is an example of this when creating his comic book series The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, with most of his stories being based on the works by Barks. Additionally, the stories by Al Taliaferro and Ted Osborne are also considered canon by many fans, being that they are the creators of Huey, Dewey, and Louie as well as Grandma Duck, and part of their work precedes Barks' own. History The core Duckverse family dates back to the golden age of American animation, generally introduced in Disney shorts, weekly newspaper comics, or comic books of the period as supporting characters for Donald Duck, who premiered in 1934 in The Wise Little Hen (but was mentioned as a friend of Mickey's as early as 1931). Donald's nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, first appeared in 1937 in Silly Symphony. Daisy Duck, Donald's on-again-off-again girlfriend premiered in 1940 in Mr. Duck Steps Out. Grandma Duck appeared in 1940 as well in Donald's own comic strip. Scrooge McDuck, the family's elderly uncle and \\"richest duck in the world\\", was created in 1947 by Carl Barks for the comic book Christmas on Bear Mountain. = Comic books = = Other media = Scrooge McDuck appeared in the 1960 Disneyland Records LP, Donald Duck and His Friends, in a plot that involved Donald and the Beagle Boys. With the exception of Scrooge's brief cameo in The Mickey Mouse Club opening theme, this marked the first appearance of a Barks-created character in a medium other than the comics and story books. Later, in 1963, the Beagle Boys played a role in Chipmunk Fun, an LP that also mentioned Scrooge.\\"Donald Duck's Quacked Records\\". Retrieved 2019-05-20.\\"Chip 'n' Dale\\" on Records\\". Retrieved 2019-05-20. Most of the characters have appeared in the 1980s Disney cartoon series DuckTales. Disney's Darkwing Duck series is nominally set in the separate DuckTales universe, in a metropolis called St. Canard, although aside from sharing the denizen Launchpad McQuack, and a few crossover episodes involving Gizmoduck, there is no interaction. Much of the DuckTales and all of the Darkwing Duck material do not appear in Barks' comics, as the two TV series was created decades after Barks's active years as a comic artist. Later, a few characters would be the main characters in the show Quack Pack. However, in the magazine Disney Adventures, there was a five-part crossover/storyline titled \\"Legend of the Chaos God\\" which began with TaleSpin, and continued with Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, Goof Troop, and DuckTales, then concluded with Darkwing Duck. Duckburg was the setting of the 1987 animated series DuckTales. The cartoon's version of Duckburg was based loosely on the comics' version. Duckburg appeared in the 1990s animated series Quack Pack. In Quack Pack, Duckburg was populated almost entirely by human beings, with Donald, Daisy, and Donald's nephews as the only anthropomorphized animals that usually appeared. Moreover, the Money Bin is nowhere to be seen. Duckburg was the setting for one of the three initial levels of the video game Quackshot and also for the second level of the video game Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers. Duckburg was also used for the setting of Mickey's Birthday land (later Mickey's Starland) at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom from 1988 to 1996. It even included Grandma Duck's Farm and a statue of Cornelius Coot, though it was more of a rural town than a burgeoning metropolis. The connection to Duckburg was removed as the land was renovated in 1996 to become Mickey's Toontown Fair. However, the Cornelius Coot statue remains. Duckburg Duckburg is the fictional city, located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota, that serves as the home of Donald Duck; Scrooge McDuck; Huey, Dewey, and Louie; Daisy Duck and most of their supporting cast. Duckburg was first mentioned in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #49 in 1944, and was created by Carl Barks. The city is populated by various anthropomorphized animals, with dogs, different birds (including ducks, geese and chickens) and pigs as the most dominant ones. The mayor of the city is often depicted as a pig, whose name most of the time goes unmentioned and is referred instead by readers as the Pig Mayor. However, in some stories the office of mayor is held by various dog characters. The size and structure of Duckburg varied in the works by Barks: it was adjusted to better fit the story he wanted to tell; it could vary from a small town to a medium-sized city, to a bustling metropolis. Later writers and artists most of the time also continues this tradition. In one specific story by Barks, Monsterville (1961), Duckburg was even transformed into a futuristic city by Gyro Gearloose, however it proved that the citizens were not ready for the high level of technology that the new city provided. Thus the city was turned back to its old city structure. In comic writer Don Rosa's stories, Duckburg and the state of Calisota is located on the West Coast of the United States, though Carl Barks himself and other writers often leave the city's location more vaguely defined. However, in Don Rosa's The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, the author alludes to where exactly he has situated Duckburg: \\"I won't bother to say precisely where I situated Duckburg and Calisota on America's west coast... but if you get out a good map and compare the coastline, you'll see that I stuck the old gold- prospector's adopted hometown directly across the bay from a very appropriately named actual city.\\" Knowing how Don Rosa used gags, it is likely that this city would be Eureka, California (Eureka meaning 'I found it'!). This fits with the river and a large forest south of Eureka. In the DuckTales episode \\"Double O' Duck\\", a map is shown which shows Duckburg as being located somewhere in Virginia or North Carolina. There are no references to the governor, legislature, Capitol, etc., of Calisota in any of the many stories about Duckburg. However, Duckburg seems to have its own governor, if it is not a sort of city-state. In more than one story a \\"Duckburg embassy\\" has been shown, which would place it outside the US at a diplomatic level. In the story Treasure of Marco Polo (Uncle Scrooge #64, 1966) by Carl Barks, the Duckburg embassy displays a flag of Duckburg, which consists of a white duck over a green field. However, in the Don Rosa story \\"His Majesty, McDuck\\" (Uncle Scrooge Adventures #14, Gladstone Aug. 1989) Scrooge gains a short-lived independence from the United States for Killmotor Hill, thus placing Duckburg within the United States. The most prominent landmark in Duckburg is Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin, a giant building sitting on Killmotor Hill (formerly known as Killmule Hill) in the center of town. The money bin contains both office space, Scrooge's private living quarters and, most famously, three cubic acres of money, the results of Scrooge's lifetime of business and treasure-seeking adventures. Another major landmark in some stories is a large statue of Duckburg's founder, Cornelius Coot. Duckburg is a major center for Space exploration, mainly operated and overseen by Gyro Gearloose, and has had expeditions to the Moon, Mars, Venus, the Asteroids, and more remote parts of the Galaxy. The city also features a sea port and is in proximity of a large forest called the Black Forest and to several mountains, the most notable being \\"Old Demon Tooth\\", usually depicted as a towering pointed peak leaning slightly to the side. The main river of the city is the Tulebug River, first mentioned in The Money Well (1958) by Carl Barks, and it is located near Killmotor Hill. Duckburg is home to Yarvard University (a play on the universities of Harvard and Yale), an institution more notable for its athletic teams than for its academic achievements. It also has had international students, like the bey of El Dagga from Egypt, who is mentioned in Yarvard's first appearance; Donald Duck and the Mummy's Ring by Carl Barks from 1943. One of the things the bey learned at the university was that mummies do not eat. Duckburg is also the home of the Billionaires Club of some of which Scrooge McDuck, John D. Rockerduck and, according to some stories, Flintheart Glomgold are influential members. Duckburg also has a Ritz Hotel, first mentioned in Carl Barks' story Turkey with All the Schemings (Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #148, 1953) at which Scrooge McDuck had a business meeting with Donald Duck; who was disguised as the Duke of Baloni, the World's Second-Richest Duck at that time. In the same story Scrooge later buys the Ritz Hotel and he still owns it in Don Rosa's story Attaaaaaack! (2000). Located near Duckburg is a farm owned and run by Grandma Duck, a direct descendant of Cornelius Coot and Donald's paternal grandmother. Donald's cousin Gus Goose also lives on Grandma's farm as a farmhand. The farm is often a gathering site for various Duck family holiday celebrations. In other languages, Duckburg (for example Entenhausen in German, Ankeborg in Swedish, Ra»õburg in Romanian, Andeby in Danish, or Pat√≥polis in Brazilian Portuguese) is not only home of \\"the Ducks\\", but Mickey Mouse and friends live there too. =History= In the comics by Don Rosa, Duckburg was a fort built on Killmule Hill on June 17, 1579 by British explorer Sir Francis Drake in the area he named Nova Albion, in what would later become the state of Calisota. It was originally known as \\"Fort Drakeborough\\". In the year 1818, during the Spanish colonization of California (1697‚Äì1821), the fort had been handed over by its departing British occupants to the visiting hunter and fur trader Cornelius Coot, who Americanized the British name of the fort to \\"Fort Duckburg\\". \\"Drake\\" means a male duck, while \\"borough\\" and \\"burg\\" are synonyms. Cornelius Coot turned the old fort into a trading post for fellow traders and hunters, and their families. Eventually a small town grew around the fort on top of Killmule Hill. In Carl Barks' story The Day Duckburg Got Dyed (1957), it is revealed that Cornelius Coot at some point in Duckburg's history managed to pipe mountain water into the town. During the American Civil War, a decisive battle was fought on top of an unnamed hill in Duckburg, led by the Duckburgian General Stonewall Duck. It is not known on which side the city fought, but with General Stonewall Duck being based on the real-life Stonewall Jackson, it can be assumed they fought for the Confederacy. However, the real- life state of California, in which the fictional state of Calisota is located according to Don Rosa, was a Unionist state, making Duckburg a more likely member of the Union. Duckburg remained a quiet, small town until the arrival of wealthy businessman Scrooge McDuck. He had bought the old fort and the hill from fellow prospector Casey Coot, a descendant of Cornelius Coot, during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1899. Scrooge proceeded to construct his famous Money Bin on the location, which would eventually cause McDuck an incredible variety of problems and dilemmas. The first one was caused by the Junior Woodchucks, who were squatting in the site and using the old fort as their headquarters, even though they did not have legal title to it. The dispute led to a small war in 1902, involving the United States marines and navy, led by then President Theodore Roosevelt. Eventually however, the construction of the Money Bin, and Scrooge's establishment of various businesses in and around Duckburg, caused Duckburg's population to swell, and turned the small town into a bustling city and a global financial centre within a few decades. =Calisota= Calisota The pronunciation is derived from the blending of those of \\"California\\" and \\"Minnesota\\". is a fictional U.S. state, created by Carl Barks in his story The Gilded Man (Four Color #422). Duckburg is among the cities located there, as well as Goosetown,\\"Boxing Donald,\\" Uncle Scrooge 367 (2007) a traditional rival of Duckburg, and Mouseton.\\"Back From the Brink\\", Walt Disney's Comics and Stories 661 (2005); \\"The World to Come Part 1: The Numbers Crunch\\", Walt Disney's Comics and Stories 703 (2010). The location of Calisota as suggested by Don Rosa Although it has many fictional elements and a variable climate, Calisota is probably synonymous with Jefferson, being roughly equivalent to Northern California. Duckburg is located north of San Francisco, with a map in Don Rosa's The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck showing Calisota corresponding to the part of California north of the 39th parallel. The name is a blend of California and Minnesota, supposedly to allow all kinds of weather or climate in the stories, although Calisota has very little in common with the latter (a state in the Upper Midwest, far from the ocean) and Northern California's regional weather is variable enough by itself. Money Bin The Money Bin is the building where Scrooge McDuck stores the portions of his money he earned by himself. Carl Barks invented the \\"money swim\\" in his story A Financial Fable (1950), followed by the \\"Money Bin\\" in the story Terror of the Beagle Boys (1951).Carl Barks: Conversations, p xxxviii. Google Books In Barks earlier stories, interchangeably with the name Money Bin, the building's official name was the McDuck Building, which was only used on facade signs. Eventually however, the name was discontinued in the later stories by Barks and subsequent writers and artists. Scrooge McDuck built the Money Bin in 1902 after having traveled around the world to make his fortune, mostly through prospecting and the establishment of various businesses. Scrooge's favorite pastime is to dive off a springboard into his money and swim through it. In most comic books stories, Scrooge lives at the Money Bin in his private quarters on the top floor, with the rooms often filled with large amounts of money. Because of Scrooge's frugality he has at times even made his own furniture and architecture out of his money; like using moneybags as chairs or using stacked paper bills as stairs to reach high places. The Money Bin also has a worry room in which Scrooge paces around in circles, which has caused a circular depression in the floor, to worry and ponder about hardships that has befallen him. The worry room was first mentioned in Carl Barks' story The Secret of Atlantis (Uncle Scrooge #5, 1954). The traditional location of the Money Bin is on top of Killmotor Hill which in turn lies atop a fault line which would prove catastrophic in the event of an earthquake, and this earthquake occurred in the story Land Beneath the Ground! (1956) by Carl Barks. The Money Bin is the victim of repeated assaults by Scrooge's enemies who try to steal his money, such as the Beagle Boys, who are after the bulk of Scrooge's money, and Magica DeSpell, who is after Scrooge's \\"Number One Dime\\", the first dime Scrooge ever earned. To protect against these attempted break-ins, Scrooge has installed the greatest security system in the world, which includes Gizmoduck in the DuckTales TV-Series, to thwart any thought of even trying to intrude onto the premises. Barks defined the volume of money contained inside as \\"three cubic acres\\", but the exact meaning of a \\"cubic acre\\" left to the reader to interpret, since an acre is a measure of area, not length. Taken literally, a cubic acre would be a 6-dimensional space of 82,653,950,016,000 ft6, i.e. feet to the sixth power. A series of blueprints created for the Scrooge McDuck story The Beagle Boys vs. the Money Bin by Don Rosa state that the money bin is approximately tall, and wide. In the story, said blueprints are accredited to an architect named Frank Lloyd Drake, who is based on the real-life architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The Money Bin also contains various valuable artifacts like the Golden Fleece, the Crown of Genghis Khan, the Crown of the Mayas, the Candy-Striped Ruby and the Goose Egg Nugget. According to Carl Barks' story The Fabulous Philosopher's Stone (Uncle Scrooge #10, 1955) Scrooge also owned the philosopher's stone at one point, but it was later confiscated by the International Money Council as it could devastate the economy because of its capability to turn base metals into gold. The Danish and Norwegian names for \\"the Money Bin\\" are Pengetanken and Pengebingen, respectively, and these have become a regular word in these languages for a large amount of money or cash.V√•r tids eventyr (\\"Our time's adventure\\") nrk.no May 6, 2003 Russell W. Belk mentions the Money Bin in Material Values in the Comics: A Content Analysis of Comic Books Featuring Themes of Wealth, where he remarks that Scrooge's \\"childish fascination with money\\", where he takes pleasure in diving and swimming in the Money Bin, might account for Scrooge not being portrayed as a villain.The Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 14, No. 1. (Jun., 1987), pp. 26-42. Penelope Fritzer in the article Scrooge McDuck: Postmodern Robber Baron considers it possible for the Money Bin to symbolize the entire Disney empire.The Journal for the Liberal Art and Sciences, Scrooge McDuck: Postmodern Robber Baron, Penelope Fritzer, Florida Atlantic University The Money Bin in the Ducktales 2017 reboot is given a total redesign. Here it is depicted as a large tower situated on an island in the waters near Duckburg, connected to the city via a bridge, and visible directly from Scrooge's bedroom window. Aside from storing his money, this incarnation of the Money Bin also serves as the corporate headquarters of McDuck Industries and the location of Gyro Gearloose's lab. =Glomgold's bin= Flintheart Glomgold also owns a money bin, located near Limpopo Valley in South Africa. Glomgold's bin substitutes the dollar sign ($) that appears on Scrooge's with a pound sign (¬£),The Second-Richest Duck comic by Carl Barks, February 2, 1956 as the South African pound was the currency of South Africa until 1961. The preference for the pound sign can also be explained by Glomgold's heritage, which puts him as a citizen of South Africa with British blood, whereas Scrooge who embraced America despite his pure Scottish blood. Number One Dime The Number One Dime is the first coin that Scrooge McDuck ever earned (or, according to some stories, produced). The Number One Dime first appeared in the story The Round Money Bin, created by Carl Barks and first published in Uncle Scrooge #3 (September, 1953). In this story, the dime is so old that it has become thin as a razor blade and allows Scrooge to cut binding ropes and escape from the Beagle Boys. In later stories, it's insinuated that the dime brings good luck to Scrooge and has helped him become a rich man, and in some stories he instantly starts losing money whenever the dime is no longer in his possession. In fact, in some series, Scrooge is so attached to the dime that he becomes hysterical, to the point of losing his mind, whenever he loses possession of the dime. It's never made clear whether the dime actually brings good luck, or if Scrooge merely believes in it so much that he is distressed and makes bad decisions whenever he no longer has his dime. Since Barks never actually said that it was because of the coin that Scrooge was the richest duck in the world, Don Rosa, after various informational exchanges with Barks, for a faithful production of The Life and Times Of Scrooge McDuck, clarified that the Number One Dime is not actually an amulet, and that this vision was just a myth. The Number One Dime is just a sentimental object that happens to be the first coin Scrooge received for his work. Rosa made clear, also, that Scrooge made his fortune working hard and being honest. This point is heavily reinforced in the DuckTales TV series where Scrooge tells his nephews about the value of hard earned cash. The dime is a key plot point in practically every story featuring Magica De Spell, a character invented by Carl Barks, as the main villain. Magica believes that by stealing the first coin earned by the richest person in the world and melting it down to a magical amulet, she can gain the power of the ancient King Midas, so that everything she touches becomes gold and she can be rich beyond her wildest dreams. The fact that this will only work if the coin indeed belongs to the richest person in the world at the time, and is the first coin that person earned, is crucial, and is made into a plot point in some stories. However, the dime only has magical value because of these circumstances and not on its own. Magica once successfully stole the dime while helping the Beagle Boys rob McDuck, stopping when she realized this would mean McDuck would no longer be the world's richest person, rendering the dime worthless. According to a comic story by Don Rosa,The Last of the Clan McDuck p. 5 it is an 1875 Seated Liberty dime, but in a comic story written by Pat and Carol McGreal and drawn by Maximino Tortajada Aguilar,See Kalle Anka & C:o issue 1-2/2010 p. 66-69. the last two digits have been swapped, making it an 1857 Seated Liberty dime. Scrooge earned the dime in 1877 in his hometown of Glasgow, when he started working as a shoeshine boy on his tenth birthday.The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck by Don Rosa Before that it belonged to Howard Rockerduck (the father of John D. Rockerduck). The customer who paid it to him, a ditch-digger called Burt, seemingly \\"cheated\\" Scrooge. In reality, Scrooge's father, Fergus McDuck, gave Burt the dime specifically for paying Scrooge for his services. Scrooge McDuck never learned that fact, although Fergus did reveal it to Scrooge's sisters Matilda and Hortense. Burt and Magica De Spell, who learned about this when she traveled in time to the day Scrooge earned the Dime, are the only other ones who know. McDuck kept it as a reminder not to be fooled again in the future. When he emigrated to the US three years later, he carried it with him. Scrooge still has the dime and keeps it on a pillow under glass because of its sentimental value. Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and Gladstone Gander among many others think it is really a lucky charm, but Scrooge himself rejects any claims beyond sentimentality. Characters Donald Duck and his maternal uncle Scrooge McDuck received nearly equal exposure in comics. (The reduced emphasis on Donald in the 1980s version of DuckTales was largely due to a Disney mandate that forbade its nascent television division from using major characters from the Golden Age of Animation, including Donald and Daisy.) Other primary characters include Donald's three young nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and girlfriend Daisy Duck. Several secondary characters have also achieved star status in certain publications, such as Grandma Duck, Donald Duck's grandmother; Gladstone Gander, Donald Duck's incredibly lucky cousin; Gyro Gearloose, an inventor who is often patronized by Scrooge; and Ludwig Von Drake, a knowledgeable professor. Scrooge also has several enemies, such as the Beagle Boys, a gang of robbers and escaped prisoners; Magica De Spell, an Italian sorceress; and South African Flintheart Glomgold and English-American John D. Rockerduck, both rival business men of Scrooge. Some characters have appeared alongside Donald primarily in animation, such as chipmunks Chip 'n' Dale (Chip an' Dale, Toy Tinkers) and Humphrey the Bear (Rugged Bear, Grin and Bear It), as well Mickey Mouse (The Dognapper, Magician Mickey) Goofy (Polar Trappers, Frank Duck Brings 'Em Back Alive), and Pluto (Donald and Pluto, Window Cleaners), who are more often associated with the Mickey Mouse universe. The Junior Woodchucks The Junior Woodchucks are the Scouting organization to which Huey, Dewey, and Louie belong. They have a uniform with a coonskin cap. The Junior Woodchucks were created by Carl Barks in 1951, in the story \\"Operation St. Bernhard\\" (Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #125). Later stories introduced a similar organization for girls, Junior Chickadees, to which Daisy Duck's nieces, April, May and June belong. The hallmark of the Junior Woodchucks is their spirited dedication to environmental protection and animal welfare, as well as the preservation of knowledge and the furtherance of science. They are also known for their exalted titles and ranks (Huey, Dewey, and Louie being promoted to become Ten-Star Generals in the 1952 story of the same name) and the awarding of buckets of badges, along with severe ideals as to decorum. In this way Barks poked gentle but pointed satire at aspects of the Boy Scouts. Brutopia Brutopia (a portmanteau word from brute and Utopia) is a fictional country appearing in several Donald Duck stories. It was created by Carl Barks in the story A Cold Bargain from 1957. Brutopia is a hostile country, aiming for world domination. It is clearly a caricature of the Soviet Union. In the Duck universe, Brutopia occasionally attempts to steal Scrooge's money so as to devastate the American economy, and to fund the creation of doomsday weaponry. Its national coat of arms has been shown either as a dagger or the hammer and shackles. Whether Brutopia is a stand-in for all of the USSR, or just for part of it, varies with the story. Sometimes parallels to Russia are drawn directly. Don Rosa has suggested that Brutopia might instead represent the eastern part of Siberia. The language of Brutopia often looks somewhat Slavic. On some occasions it is written in Cyrillic script. On the other hand, Brutopians seem to speak perfect, non- accented English; and other stories show English language texts being used by Brutopians. In 1957, Brutopia's military spending budget amounted to one trillion dollars plus all the kitchen sinks of its happy people (a number that on closer inspection turned out to be five). Scrooge McDuck outbid the Brutopian government by paying one trillion dollars and six kitchen sinks for a sample of the recently discovered substance of bombastium. Bombastium Bombastium is a fictional chemical element.Uncle Scrooge #17 by Carl Barks Its atomic number and atomic symbol are unknown. Bombastium is stated to be the rarest element in the world. Even though it is very coveted, its usage potential is not entirely known. One characteristic is that it tastes different every time you try it, and scientists eventually discovered that one atom of bombastium dropped into a barrel of water becomes one barrel of ice cream - a different flavor of ice cream each time. The element is orange-brown in color and is about the size of a soccer ball. To avoid evaporation, bombastium must be kept frozen. The only piece of bombastium known to exist was found in the Belgian Congo, and it was soon after its discovery acquired by Scrooge McDuck in the 1957 story \\"A Cold Bargain\\" by Carl Barks, but at that time it was also heavily sought after by the hostile nation of Brutopia. Brutopia's military spending budget that year amounted to one trillion dollars plus all the kitchen sinks of its happy people. Scrooge McDuck therefore had to pay one trillion dollars plus six kitchen sinks to win the auction. The element was also used for the 5-part DuckTales episode \\"Time is Money,\\" which introduced Bubba the Caveduck. In this cartoon episode, bombastium is the fuel for one of Gyro Gearloose's inventions, a time traveling helicopter named the Millennium Shortcut. The bombastium itself must be kept frozen in order for it to be usable as fuel (a small freezer is equipped on board the Shortcut for this purpose). Otherwise, the Shortcut could not travel through time. One of the treasures that can be obtained in the computer game DuckTales: The Quest for Gold is bombastium. Unlike the other treasures, bombastium is worth more than just money, as Gyro Gearloose can use it to build a matter transporter which takes away the risk of flying from place to place while having the possible downside of sending the player to a location they hadn't intended to go. Squiggs Squiggs are fairly small fish that are typically eaten \\"oolated.\\" The fish were a key plot element in the Don Rosa story \\"Oolated Luck,\\" and the words \\"squigg\\" and \\"oolated\\" were coined by Rosa's idol Carl Barks in an earlier story, which Rosa based his story on. Conserved oolated squiggs are fairly cheap and wholesome food but don't taste particularly good, and smell worse. Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander once took part in a competition organized by a company producing oolated squiggs, where the grand prize was an ocean liner cruise.

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. Many literary critics consider The Great Gatsby to be one of the greatest novels ever written. The story of the book primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession to reunite with his ex-lover, the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald, inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island's North Shore, began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \\"something new‚Äîsomething extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\\" Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referred to the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. First published by Scribner's in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades.: \\"Fitzgerald scholar James L. W. West III says it is no coincidence that The Great Gatsby is probably the American novel most often taught in the rest of the world. 'It is our novel, how we present ourselves. ... He captured and distilled the essence of the American spirit.'\\" Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title of the \\"Great American Novel.\\" The novel's U.S. copyright will expire on January 1, 2021, when all works published in 1925 enter the public domain in the United States.  Historical context  Set on the prosperous Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby provides a critical social history of Prohibition-era America during the Jazz Age. That period‚Äîknown for its jazz music,: \\"The word jazz in its progress toward respectability has meant first sex, then dancing, then music. It is associated with a state of nervous stimulation, not unlike that of big cities behind the lines of a war.\\" economic prosperity, flapper culture,: \\"Scarcely had the staider citizens of the republic caught their breaths when the wildest of all generations, the generation which had been adolescent during the confusion of the [Great] War, brusquely shouldered my contemporaries out of the way and danced into the limelight. This was the generation whose girls dramatized themselves as flappers, the generation that corrupted its elders and eventually overreached itself less through lack of morals than through lack of taste.\\" libertine mores,: \\"The less sought-after girls who had become resigned to sublimating probable celibacy, came across Freud and Jung in seeking their intellectual recompense and came tearing back into the fray. By 1926 the universal preoccupation with sex had become a nuisance.\\" rebellious youth,: \\"Youth in revolt didn't start at Woodstock, it began with Gertrude Stein's Lost Generation.\\" and ubiquitous speakeasies‚Äîis fully rendered in Fitzgerald's fictional narrative. Fitzgerald uses many of these 1920s societal developments to tell his story, from simple details such as petting in automobiles: \\"As far back as 1915 the unchaperoned young people of the smaller cities had discovered the mobile privacy of that automobile given to young Bill at sixteen to make him 'self-reliant'. At first petting was a desperate adventure even under such favorable conditions, but presently confidences were exchanged and the old commandment broke down.\\" to broader themes such as Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to bootlegging as the source of Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the hedonistic society of the Jazz Age by placing a relatable plotline within the historical context of \\"the most raucous, gaudy era in U.S. history,\\" which \\"raced along under its own power, served by great filling stations full of money.\\": \\"In any case, the Jazz Age now raced along under its own power, served by great filling stations full of money.\\" In Fitzgerald's eyes, the 1920s era represented a morally permissive time when Americans of all ages became disillusioned with prevailing social norms and were monomaniacally obsessed with self- gratification: \\"[The Jazz Age represented] a whole race going hedonistic, deciding on pleasure.\\": \\"[The Jazz Age represented] a whole race going hedonistic, deciding on pleasure.\\" Hence, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to communicate his ambivalent feelings regarding the Jazz Age, an era whose themes he would later regard as reflective of events in his own life.: Fitzgerald documented the Jazz Age and his own life's relation to the era in his essay, \\"Echoes of the Jazz Age\\" which was later published in the essay collection The Crack-Up. Various events in Fitzgerald's youth are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young Midwesterner from Minnesota, and, like the novel's narrator who went to Yale, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton. While at Princeton, the 19-year- old Fitzgerald met Ginevra King, a 16-year-old socialite with whom he fell in love.: Fitzgerald later confided to his daughter that Ginevra King \\"was the first girl I ever loved\\" and that he \\"faithfully avoided seeing her\\" in order to \\"keep the illusion perfect.\\" However, Ginevra's family discouraged Fitzgerald's pursuit of their daughter due to his lower-class status, and her father purportedly told the young Fitzgerald that \\"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls.\\" Rejected as a suitor due to his lack of financial prospects, Fitzgerald joined the United States Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery, Alabama where he met Zelda Sayre, a vivacious 17-year-old Southern belle. Zelda agreed to marry him but her parents ended their engagement until he could prove a financial success. Thus Fitzgerald is similar to Jay Gatsby in that he fell in love while a military officer stationed far from home and then sought success to prove himself to the woman he loved. After his success as a novelist and as a short story writer, Fitzgerald married Zelda and moved to New York. He found his new affluent lifestyle in the exclusive Long Island social milieu to be simultaneously both seductive and repulsive. Fitzgerald‚Äîlike Gatsby‚Äîhad always exalted the rich and was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he desired, even as he was led towards a lifestyle which he loathed.  Plot summary  In Spring 1922, Nick Carraway‚Äîa Yale alumnus from the Midwest and a veteran of the Great War‚Äîjourneys east to New York City to obtain employment as a bond salesman. He rents a bungalow in the Long Island village of West Egg, next to a luxurious estate inhabited by Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic multi-millionaire who hosts dazzling soir√©es yet does not partake in them. One evening, Nick dines with his distant relative, Daisy Buchanan, in the fashionable town of East Egg. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, formerly a Yale football star whom Nick knew during his college days. The couple has recently relocated from Chicago to a colonial mansion directly across the bay from Gatsby's estate. At their mansion, Nick encounters Jordan Baker, an insolent flapper and golf champion who is a childhood friend of Daisy's. Jordan confides to Nick that Tom keeps a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who brazenly telephones him at his home and who lives in the \\"valley of ashes,\\" a sprawling refuse dump. That evening, Nick sees Gatsby standing alone on his lawn, staring at a green light across the bay. Days later, Nick reluctantly accompanies a drunken and agitated Tom to New York City by train. En route, they stop at a garage inhabited by mechanic George Wilson and his wife Myrtle.ArchiTakes, architecture in New York and beyond, December 17th, 2009. The Iron Triangle / Wilson‚Äôs Garage. Myrtle joins them, and the trio proceed to a small New York apartment that Tom has rented for trysts with her. Guests arrive, and a party ensues that ends with Tom slapping Myrtle and breaking her nose after she mentions Daisy. One morning, Nick receives a formal invitation to a party at Gatsby's mansion. Once there, Nick is embarrassed that he recognizes no one and begins drinking heavily until he encounters Jordan. While chatting with her, he is approached by a man who introduces himself as Jay Gatsby and insists that both he and Nick served in the 3rd Infantry Division during the war. Gatsby attempts to ingratiate himself with Nick and, when Nick leaves the party, he notices Gatsby watching him. In late July, Nick and Gatsby have lunch at a speakeasy. Gatsby tries to impress Nick with tales of his war heroism and his Oxford days. Afterward, Nick meets Jordan at the Plaza Hotel. She reveals that Gatsby and Daisy met around 1917 when Gatsby was an officer in the American Expeditionary Forces. They fell in love, but when Gatsby was deployed overseas, Daisy reluctantly married Tom. Gatsby hopes that his newfound wealth and dazzling parties will make Daisy reconsider. Gatsby uses Nick to stage a reunion with Daisy, and the two embark upon a sexual affair. The twenty-story Plaza Hotel in the 1920s‚Äîa ch√¢teau-like edifice with an architectural style inspired by the French Renaissance. In September, Tom discovers the affair when Daisy carelessly addresses Gatsby with unabashed intimacy in front of him. Later, at a Plaza Hotel suite, Gatsby and Tom argue about the affair. Gatsby insists that Daisy declare that she never loved Tom. Daisy claims she loves Tom and Gatsby, upsetting both. Tom reveals that Gatsby is a swindler whose money comes from bootlegging alcohol. Upon hearing this, Daisy chooses to stay with Tom. Tom scornfully tells Gatsby to drive her home, knowing that Daisy will never leave him. While returning to East Egg, Gatsby and Daisy drive by Wilson's garage and their car accidentally strikes Tom's mistress, Myrtle, killing her instantly. Gatsby reveals to Nick that it was Daisy who was driving the car, but that he intends to take the blame for the accident to protect her. Nick urges Gatsby to flee to avoid prosecution, but he refuses. After Tom tells George that Gatsby owns the car that struck Myrtle, a distraught George assumes the owner of the vehicle must be Myrtle's paramour. George fatally shoots Gatsby in his mansion's swimming pool, then commits suicide. Several days after Gatsby's murder, his father Henry Gatz arrives for the sparsely-attended funeral. After Gatsby's death, Nick comes to hate New York and decides that Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and he were all Westerners unsuited to Eastern life. Nick encounters Tom and refuses to shake his hand. Tom admits that he was the one who told George that Gatsby owned the vehicle that killed Myrtle. Before returning to the Midwest, Nick returns to Gatsby's mansion one last time and stares across the bay at the green light emanating from the end of Daisy's dock.  Major characters  * Nick Carraway‚Äîa Yale University graduate from the Midwest, a World veteran, and, at the start of the plot, a newly arrived resident of West Egg, age 29 (later 30). He also serves as the first-person narrator of the novel. He is Gatsby's next-door neighbor and a bond salesman. He is easy-going, occasionally sarcastic, and somewhat optimistic, although this latter quality fades as the novel progresses. He is more grounded and more practical than the other characters, and is always in awe of their lifestyles and morals. * Jay Gatsby (originally James \\"Jimmy\\" Gatz)‚Äîa young, mysterious millionaire with shady business connections (later revealed to be a bootlegger), originally from North Dakota. During World , when he was a young military officer stationed at the United States Army's Camp Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, he encountered the love of his life, the beautiful debutante Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby is also said to have briefly studied at Trinity College, Oxford in England after the end of the war. According to Fitzgerald's wife Zelda, the character was based on the bootlegger and former World officer, Max Gerlach.: \\"Jay Gatsby was inspired in part by a local figure, Max Gerlach. Near the end of her life Zelda Fitzgerald said that Gatsby was based on 'a neighbor named Von Guerlach or something who was said to be General Pershing's nephew and was in trouble over bootlegging.'\\" * Daisy Buchanan‚Äîan attractive, though shallow and self- absorbed, young debutante and socialite from Louisville, Kentucky, identified as a flapper. She is Nick's second cousin once removed, and the wife of Tom Buchanan. Before she married Tom, Daisy had a romantic relationship with Gatsby. Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the central conflicts in the novel. The character of Daisy is believed to have been inspired by Fitzgerald's youthful romances with Ginevra King. * Thomas \\"Tom\\" Buchanan‚Äîa millionaire who lives in East Egg, and Daisy's husband. Tom is an imposing man of muscular build with a \\"husky tenor\\" voice and arrogant demeanor. He was a football star at Yale University. Buchanan has parallels with William Mitchell, the Chicagoan who married Ginevra King. Buchanan and Mitchell were both Chicagoans with an interest in polo. Like Ginevra's father, whom Fitzgerald resented, Buchanan attended Yale and is a white supremacist. * Jordan Baker‚Äîan amateur golfer and Daisy Buchanan's long-time friend with a sarcastic streak and an aloof attitude. She is Nick Carraway's girlfriend for most of the novel, though they grow apart towards the end. She has a slightly shady reputation because of rumors that she had cheated in a tournament, which harmed her reputation socially and as a golfer. Fitzgerald told Maxwell Perkins that Jordan was based on the golfer Edith Cummings, a friend of Ginevra King, though Cummings was never suspected of cheating. Her name is a play on the two popular automobile brands, the Jordan Motor Car Company and the Baker Motor Vehicle, both of Cleveland, Ohio, alluding to Jordan's \\"fast\\" reputation and the new freedom presented to Americans, especially women, in the 1920s. * George B. Wilson‚Äîa mechanic and owner of a garage. He is disliked by both his wife, Myrtle Wilson and Tom Buchanan, who describes him as \\"so dumb he doesn't know he's alive.\\" At the end of the novel, he kills Gatsby, wrongly believing that he had been driving the car that killed Myrtle, and then kills himself. * Myrtle Wilson‚ÄîGeorge's wife, and Tom Buchanan's mistress. Myrtle, who possesses a fierce vitality, is desperate to find refuge from her disappointing marriage. She is accidentally killed by Gatsby's car, as she thinks it is Tom still driving and runs after it (driven by Daisy, though Gatsby takes the blame for the accident). * Meyer Wolfsheim‚Äîa Jewish friend and mentor of Gatsby's, described as a gambler who fixed the 1919 World Series. Wolfsheim appears only twice in the novel, the second time refusing to attend Gatsby's funeral. He is a clear allusion to Arnold Rothstein,: \\"Meyer Wolfshiem, 'the man who fixed the World Series back in 1919,' was obviously based on gambler Arnold Rothstein, whom Fitzgerald had met in unknown circumstances.\\" a New York crime kingpin who was notoriously blamed for the Black Sox Scandal that tainted the 1919 World Series.  Writing and production  Fitzgerald began planning his third novel in June 1922, but it was interrupted by the production of his play, The Vegetable, in the summer and fall.: \\"He had begun to plan the novel in June 1923, saying to Maxwell Perkins, 'I want to write something new ‚Äî something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.' But that summer and fall were devoted to the production of his play, 'The Vegetable.'\\" The play failed miserably, and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production. The stories were, in his words, \\"all trash and it nearly broke my heart,\\" although included among those stories was \\"Winter Dreams,\\" which Fitzgerald later described as \\"a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea.\\" After the birth of their only child, Frances Scott \\"Scottie\\" Fitzgerald, the Fitzgeralds moved in October 1922 to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island. The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields, and comedian Ed Wynn. These figures were all considered to be \\"new money,\\" unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula‚Äîplaces that were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families, and which sat across the bay from Great Neck. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg.\\" In this novel, Great Neck (Kings Point) became the \\"new money\\" peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) became the \\"old money\\" East Egg. Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's home, such as Oheka Castle and Beacon Towers, since demolished. (Another possible inspiration was Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party.) While the Fitzgeralds were living in New York, the Hall-Mills murder case was sensationalized in the daily newspapers over the course of many months, and the highly publicized case likely influenced the plot of Fitzgerald's novel. The case involved the double-murder of a man and his lover which occurred on September 14, 1922, mere weeks before Fitzgerald and his wife arrived in Great Neck. Scholars have speculated that Fitzgerald based certain aspects of the ending of The Great Gatsby as well as various characterizations on this factual incident. By mid-1923, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel, but discarded most of his new story as a false start. Some of it, however, resurfaced in the 1924 short story \\"Absolution.\\" Work on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924. Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger, \\"Out of woods at last and starting novel.\\" He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a \\"consciously artistic achievement\\". Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins: \\"I feel I have enormous power in me now. This book will be a consciously artistic achievement and must depend on that as the first books did not.\\" and a \\"purely creative work‚Äînot trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world.\\" Soon after this burst of inspiration, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera, where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed. By August, however, Fitzgerald was hard at work and completed what he believed to be his final manuscript in October, sending the book to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, and agent, Harold Ober, on October 30. The Fitzgeralds then moved to Rome for the winter. Fitzgerald made revisions through the winter after Perkins informed him in a November letter that the character of Gatsby was \\"somewhat vague\\" and Gatsby's wealth and business, respectively, needed \\"the suggestion of an explanation\\" and should be \\"adumbrated.\\" Fitzgerald thanked Perkins for his detailed criticisms and stated, \\"With the aid you've given me I can make Gatsby perfect.\\" Content after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald returned the final batch of revised galleys in the middle of February 1925. Fitzgerald's revisions included an extensive rewriting of Chapters VI and VIII. Further, he refused $10,000 for the serial rights to the book so that it could be published sooner. He had received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and $1,981.25 upon publication.  Cover art  The cover of the first printing of The Great Gatsby is among the most celebrated pieces of art in American literature. It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it. The cover was completed before the novel, and Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had \\"written it into\\" the novel.. Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins: \\"For Christ's sake don't give anyone that jacket you're saving for me. I've written it into the book.\\" Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg,: \\"We are left then with the enticing possibility that Fitzgerald's arresting image was originally prompted by Cugat's fantastic apparitions over the valley of ashes; in other words, that the author derived his inventive metamorphosis from a recurrent theme of Cugat's trial jackets, one which the artist himself was to reinterpret and transform through subsequent drafts.\\" depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop, which Fitzgerald described as: Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the \\"girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs.\\" Years later, Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but \\"Scott told me not to be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story. He said he had liked the jacket and now he didn't like it.\\"  Alternative titles  Fitzgerald's editor, Maxwell Perkins, convinced the author to abandon his original title of Trimalchio in West Egg in favor of The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly choosing The Great Gatsby,: Donald Skemer states: \\"[Fitzgerald] went through many, many titles including Under the Red, White, and Blue and Trimalchio and Gold-hatted Gatsby.\\" James West also lists other titles such as \\"The High Bouncing Lover\\" and adds that \\"in the end [Fitzgerald] didn't think that The Great Gatsby was a very good title.\\" a title inspired by Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes. Previously he had shifted between Gatsby, Among Ash-Heaps and Millionaires, Trimalchio, Trimalchio in West Egg,: \\"A week later, in his next letter, he was floundering: 'I have not decided to stick to the title I put on the book, Trimalchio in West Egg. The only other titles that seem to fit it are Trimalchio and On the Road to West Egg. I had two others, Gold-hatted Gatsby and The High-bouncing Lover, but they seemed too slight.'\\" On the Road to West Egg, Under the Red, White, and Blue, The Gold-Hatted Gatsby, and The High- Bouncing Lover. The titles The Gold-Hatted Gatsby and The High-Bouncing Lover came from Fitzgerald's epigraph for the novel, one which he wrote himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D'Invilliers. He initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio, the crude parvenu in Petronius's Satyricon, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel: Unlike Gatsby's spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the audacious and libidinous orgies he hosted but, according to Tony Tanner's introduction to the Penguin edition, there are subtle similarities between the two. In November 1924, Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that \\"I have now decided to stick to the title I put on the book ... Trimalchio in West Egg,\\" but was eventually persuaded that the reference was too obscure and that people would not be able to pronounce it. His wife, Zelda, and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby and the next month Fitzgerald agreed. A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925, Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White, and Blue, but it was at that stage too late to change.: \\"At the last minute, [Fitzgerald] had asked his editor if they could change the new novel's title to Under the Red, White, and Blue, but it was too late.\\" The Great Gatsby was published on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald remarked that \\"the title is only fair, rather bad than good.\\" Early drafts of the novel have been published under the title Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby. A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream in Trimalchio. Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Gatsby is more even, although Daisy still returns to Tom.  Contemporary reception  The Great Gatsby was published by Charles Scribner's Sons on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald called Perkins on the day of publication to monitor reviews: \\"Any news?\\" \\"Sales situation doubtful,\\" read a wire from Perkins on April 20, \\"[but] excellent reviews.\\" Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable \\"depressed\\" him, closing the letter with \\"Yours in great depression.\\" Fitzgerald had hoped the novel would be a great commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies. The book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies by the time the original sale was done in October. Despite this, Scribner's kept the original edition of the book on their trade list until 1946. At that time, three other forms of Gatsby were in print, so there was no longer any point to holding onto the original edition. Fitzgerald received letters of praise from contemporaries T. S. Eliot, Edith Wharton, and Willa Cather regarding the novel; however, this was private opinion, and Fitzgerald feverishly sought the public recognition of reviewers and readers. Critic H.L. Mencken dismissed the novel upon its publication as lacking in substance, although he praised its ending. The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews from literary critics of the day. Generally the most effusive of the positive reviews was Edwin Clark of The New York Times, who felt the novel was \\"A curious book, a mystical, glamourous story of today.\\" Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"[the novel] leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder,\\" calling the book \\"a revelation of life\\" and \\"a work of art.\\" The New York Post called the book \\"fascinating ... His style fairly scintillates, and with a genuine brilliance; he writes surely and soundly.\\" The New York Herald Tribune was less impressed, referring to The Great Gatsby as \\"purely ephemeral phenomenon, but it contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine‚Äîso light, so delicate, so sharp ... a literary lemon meringue.\\" In The Chicago Daily Tribune, H. L. Mencken called the book \\"in form no more than a glorified anecdote, and not too probable at that,\\" while praising the book's \\"charm and beauty of the writing\\" and the \\"careful and brilliant finish.\\": \\"The Great Gatsby is in form no more than a glorified anecdote, and not too probable at that. The story for all its basic triviality has a fine texture; a careful and brilliant finish... What gives the story distinction is something quite different from the management of the action or the handling of the characters; it is the charm and beauty of the writing.\\" Several writers felt that the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: \\"One finishes Great Gatsby with a feeling of regret, not for the fate of the people in the book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald.\\" John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, \\"Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw.\\" Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book \\"a minor performance ... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical.\\" Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style \\"painfully forced,\\" noting that the editors of the paper were \\"quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day.\\" The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: \\"All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about.\\" Fitzgerald's goal was to produce a literary work which would truly prove himself as a writer, and Gatsby did not have the commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper Library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis' stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye. For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece. By the time Fitzgerald died in 1940, the novel had fallen into near obscurity.  Revival and reassessment  Fitzgerald's friend Edmund Wilson helped revive the author's posthumous reputation. In 1940, Fitzgerald suffered a third and fatal heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten.: \\"When 'Gatsby' author F. Scott Fitzgerald died in 1940, he thought he was a failure.\\" His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as Fitzgerald \\"at his best.\\" A strong appreciation for the book gradually developed in underground circles. Future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it, and author John O'Hara acknowledged its influence.: \\"Writers like John O'Hara were showing its influence and younger men like Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg, who would presently be deeply affected by it, were discovering it.\\" Thus, by the time that Gatsby was republished in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941, the general consensus was that the book was an enduring work of fiction. In 1942, a group of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime. The council's purpose was to distribute paperback Armed Services Editions books to soldiers fighting in the Second World War. The Great Gatsby was one of these books. The books proved to be \\"as popular as pin-up girls\\" among the soldiers, according to the Saturday Evening Posts contemporary report. 155,000 copies of Gatsby were distributed to soldiers overseas.: \\"One hundred fifty-five thousand ASE copies of The Great Gatsby were distributed-as against the twenty-five thousand copies of the novel printed by Scribners between 1925 and 1942.\\" By 1944, full-length articles on Fitzgerald's works were being published, and the following year, \\"the opinion that Gatsby was merely a period piece had almost entirely disappeared.\\" This revival was paved by interest shown by literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald's friend. In 1951, Arthur Mizener published The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of Fitzgerald. He emphasized The Great Gatsbys positive reception by literary critics, which may have influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it. By 1960, the book was steadily selling 50,000 copies per year, and renewed interest led The New York Times editorialist Mizener to proclaim the novel \\"a classic of twentieth-century American fiction.\\" The Great Gatsby has sold over 25 million copies worldwide as of 2013, annually sells an additional 500,000 copies and is Scribner's most popular title; in 2013, the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies.  Critical analysis  = Themes =  American Dream  The \\"American dream\\"‚Äîthe \\"belief that every man, whatever his origins may pursue and attain his chosen goals\\"‚Äîis a central theme underlying Fitzgerald's work. Following the novel's revival, later critical writings on The Great Gatsby focus in particular on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American dream in the context of the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined.: \\"[Fitzgerald] was the self-appointed spokesman for the 'Jazz Age,' a term he takes credit for coining, and he gave it its arch-high priest and prophet, Jay Gatsby, in his novel The Great Gatsby.\\" In 1970, scholar Roger L. Pearson published an essay in which he asserted that Fitzgerald \\"has come to be associated with this concept of the American dream more than any other writer of the twentieth century.\\" Pearson traced the literary origins of this particular dream to Colonial America: However, Pearson noted that \\"Fitzgerald's unique expression of the American dream lacks the optimism, the sense of fulfillment, so evident in the expressions of his predecessors.\\" He posited that Fitzgerald created the character of Gatsby to serve as a false prophet of the American dream and to demonstrate how that dream no longer exists except in the minds of those as materialistic as Gatsby. Pearson concluded that the American dream pursued by Gatsby \\"is, in reality, a nightmare,\\" bringing nothing but discontent and disillusionment to those who chase it as they realize that it is unsustainable and ultimately unattainable. Echoing Pearson's interpretation, scholar Sarah Churchwell similarly views The Great Gatsby to be a \\"cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the American dream.\\" Churchwell posits the story concerns the limits of America's ideals of social and class mobility, and the hopelessness of lower-class aspirants to transcend the stations of their birth. This is illustrated through the novel's narrator, Nick Carraway, who observes that \\"a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\\" Churchwell posits that Fitzgerald's novel is \\"a story of class warfare in a nation that denies it even has a class system, in which the game is eternally rigged for the rich to win.\\" The green light that shines at the end of the dock of Daisy's house across the Sound from Gatsby's house is frequently mentioned in the background of the plot. It has variously been interpreted as a symbol of Gatsby's longing for Daisy and, more broadly, of the American dream.  Gender relations  In addition to exploring the trials and tribulations of achieving the American dream during the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme. Although early scholars viewed the character of Daisy Buchanan to be a \\"monster of bitchery,\\" later scholars such as Leland S. Person, Jr. asserted that Daisy's character exemplifies the marginalization of women in the East Egg social milieu that Fitzgerald depicts.: \\"Often dismissed as a selfish ditz, is Daisy victimized by a society that offers her no career path except marriage to big bucks?\\" Writing in 1978, Person noted that: Daisy is thus \\"reduced to a golden statue, a collector's item which crowns Gatsby's material success.\\" As an upper-class white woman living in East Egg during this time period, Daisy must adhere to societal expectations and gender norms such as actively fulfilling the roles of dutiful wife, mother, keeper of the house, and charming socialite. Many of Daisy's choices‚Äîultimately culminating in the tragedy of the ending and misery for all those involved‚Äîcan be partly attributed to her prescribed role as a \\"beautiful little fool\\" who is reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. Her decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby is thus attributable to the status, security, and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides.  Class inequality  Journalist Nick Gillespie interprets The Great Gatsby as a story of the underlying permanence of class differences, even \\"in the face of a modern economy based not on status and inherited position but on innovation and an ability to meet ever-changing consumer needs.\\" This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it, whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants or the nouveau riche or successful minorities. Americans living in the 1920s to the present are thus defined by their fluctuating economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, \\"While the specific terms of the equation are always changing, it's easy to see echoes of Gatsbys basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society.\\" Because this can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby, which has contributed to the novel's enduring popularity.  Other interpretations  Environmental criticism of Gatsby seeks to place the novel and its characters in historical context almost a century after its original publication. These interpretations argue that Jay Gatsby and The Great Gatsby can be viewed as the personification and representation of human-caused climate change, as \\"Gatsby's life depends on many human-centered, selfish endeavors\\" which are \\"in some part responsible for Earth's current ecological crisis.\\" = Controversy = Like many of Fitzgerald's works, The Great Gatsby has been accused of displaying anti- Semitism through the use of Jewish stereotypes. The book describes Meyer Wolfsheim as \\"a small, flat-nosed Jew\\", with \\"tiny eyes\\" and \\"two fine growths of hair\\" in his nostrils, while his nose is described as \\"expressive\\", \\"tragic\\", and able to \\"flash... indignantly\\". A dishonest and corrupt profiteer who assisted Gatsby's bootlegging operations and manipulated the World Series, Wolfsheim has also been seen as representing the Jewish miser stereotype. Richard Levy, author of Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, claims that Wolfsheim is \\"pointedly connected Jewishness and crookedness\\". In a 1947 article for Commentary, Milton Hindus, an assistant professor of humanities at the University of Chicago, stated that while he believed the book was \\"excellent\\" on balance, Wolfsheim \\"is easily its most obnoxious character\\", and \\"the novel reads very much like an anti- Semitic document\\". Hindus argued that the Jewish stereotypes displayed by Wolfsheim were typical of the time period in which the novel was written and set and that its anti-Semitism was of the \\"habitual, customary, 'harmless,' unpolitical variety.\\" A 2015 article by Arthur Krystal agreed with Hindus' assessment that Fitzgerald's use of Jewish caricatures was not driven by malice and merely reflected commonly-held beliefs of his time. He notes the accounts of Frances Kroll, a Jewish woman and secretary to Fitzgerald, who claimed that Fitzgerald was hurt by accusations of anti-Semitism and responded to critiques of Wolfsheim by claiming that he merely \\"fulfilled a function in the story and had nothing to do with race or religion\\". This claim is further supported by evidence that Wolfsheim was based on real-life Jewish gambler Arnold Rothstein.

The film was directed by William A. Wellman and stars James Cagney, Jean Harlow, Edward Woods, Donald Cook and Joan Blondell. The film relates the story of a young man's rise in the criminal underworld in prohibition-era urban America. The supporting players include Beryl Mercer, Murray Kinnell, and Mae Clarke. The screenplay is based on an unpublished novel‚ÄîBeer and Blood by two former newspapermen, John Bright and Kubec Glasmon‚Äîwho had witnessed some of Al Capone's murderous gang rivalries in Chicago. In 1998, The Public Enemy was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot James Cagney and Edward Woods in The Public Enemy As youngsters in 1900s Chicago, Irish-Americans Tom Powers (James Cagney) and his lifelong friend Matt Doyle (Edward Woods) engage in petty theft, selling their loot to \\"Putty Nose\\" (Murray Kinnell). Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang on a fur warehouse robbery, assuring them he will take care of them if anything goes wrong. When Tom is startled by a stuffed bear, he shoots it, alerting the police, who kill gang member Larry Dalton. Chased by a cop, Tom and Matt gun him down. However, when they go to Putty Nose for help, they find he has left town. Tom's straightlaced older brother Mike Powers (Donald Cook) tries, but fails, to talk Tom into giving up crime. Tom keeps his activities secret from his doting mother (Beryl Mercer). When America enters World War I in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines. In 1920, with Prohibition about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan (Robert Emmett O'Connor) recruits Tom and Matt as beer \\"salesmen\\" (enforcers) in his bootlegging business. He allies himself with noted gangster Samuel \\"Nails\\" Nathan (Leslie Fenton). As the bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth. James Cagney in The Public Enemy Mike finds out that his brother's money comes not from politics, as Tom claims, but from bootlegging, and declares that Tom's success is based on nothing more than \\"beer and blood\\" (the title of the book upon which the film is based). Tom retorts in disgust: \\"Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.\\" Tom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty (an uncredited Mae Clarke) and Mamie (Joan Blondell) respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; in a famous scene, when she complains once too often, he angrily pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen (Jean Harlow), a woman with a confessed weakness for bad men. At a restaurant on the night of Matt's wedding reception to Mamie, Tom and Matt recognize Putty Nose and follow him home. Begging for his life, Putty plays a song on the piano that he had entertained Tom and Matt with when they were children. Tom shoots him in the back. Tom gives his mother a large wad of money, but Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother's face. \\"Nails\\" Nathan dies in a horse riding accident, prompting Tom to find the horse and shoot it. A rival gang headed by \\"Schemer\\" Burns takes advantage of the disarray resulting from Nathan's death, precipitating a gang war. Later, Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. Tom is seriously wounded in the shootout, and ends up in the hospital. When his mother, brother, and Matt's sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, Paddy warns Mike that Tom has been kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital. Later, his dead body is returned to the Powers home. Cast Production =Development= The screenplay which was written by Harvey F. Thew was based on a novel which was never published called Beer and Blood, by John Bright and Kubec Glasmon. Bright and Glasmon based their novel on actual people, having witnessed some of Al Capone's murderous gang rivalries in Chicago. Warner Bros. studio head Darryl F. Zanuck bought the rights to the novel and assigned director William A. Wellman to direct the film. Wellman, who had served in World War I like the brother of the main character, told Zanuck: \\"I'll bring you the toughest, most violent picture you ever did see\\". =Casting= Edward Woods was originally cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and James Cagney was cast as Tom's best friend Matt Doyle, until director Wellman decided Cagney would be more effective in the part and switched the two actors but never reshot the sequences with the characters as children, which is why the child playing Cagney's role looks like Woods while the one playing Woods' role looks like Cagney. Another reason for the switch is that the sound technology used in The Public Enemy was superior to that used in earlier films, making it no longer imperative to have an actor in the lead role who had impeccable enunciation. Louise Brooks was the original choice for Gwen Allen, a woman with self-confessed weakness for bad men. She refused the role, which went to a younger actress, Jean Harlow. Brooks' name was in studio records/casting call lists playing \\"Bess\\" in this movie, but she and her character did not appear. Brooks later explained herself to Wellman (who had directed her in Beggars of Life (1928)) by saying that she hated making pictures because she simply \\"hated Hollywood\\".Paris (1989), p. 359 In the opinion of Brooks's biographer Barry Paris, \\"turning down Public Enemy marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career\\". Tom's first girlfriend Kitty was played by Mae Clarke, who was uncredited. Kitty is eventually dropped off by Tom for Gwen after he pushes half a grapefruit into her face, the most famous scene in the movie. Joan Blondell played Mamie, Matt's girlfriend. She had already worked with Cagney in Sinners' Holiday (1930) and would work with him on two films which also came out this year: God's Gift in Women and Blonde Crazy. Other films that they worked together on were The Crowd Roars (1932), Footlight Parade (1933) and He Was Her Man (1934). Cagney once said that Blondell was the only woman he loved besides his wife. Donald Cook played Tom's brother, Mike. =Filming= Filming took place in January and February 1931, with a small budget of $151,000. During filming, Cagney also made Smart Money, co- starring Edward G. Robinson, who had finished his breakthrough film Little Caesar. In the scene where Mike Powers punches his brother Tom, Wellman privately took Donald Cook aside and, explaining his desire for authenticity in Tom's reaction, asked the actor to really hit Cagney. Cook played his part a bit too well, and he struck Cagney in the mouth with such force, he actually broke one of Cagney's teeth. Yet in spite of his genuine shock and pain, Cagney stayed in character and played out the rest of the scene. In another incident, live ammunition was used in a scene where Tom Powers ducks around the corner of a building to take cover from machine gun fire; the use of live ammunition was common practice at the time. The bullets struck the wall of the building at the position where Cagney's head had been just a moment before.Watson, Teresa. (2008, September). \\"James Cagney - Star of the Month\\", midnightpalace.com; accessed October 9, 2015. =Grapefruit scene= A controversial scene in which Tom (James Cagney) angrily smashes a half grapefruit into his girlfriend's face (Mae Clarke) In a 1973 interview featured in the Turner Classic Movies documentary The Men Who Made The Movies: William Wellman, Wellman said he added the grapefruit \\"hitting\\" to the scene, because when he and his wife at the time would get into fights, she would never talk or give any expression. Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion; he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation. Some, such as film critic Ben Mankiewicz, have asserted that Mae Clarke's surprised and seemingly somewhat angry reaction to the grapefruit was genuine, as she hadn't been told to expect the unscripted action.Turner Classic Movies (October 17, 2010). The Public Enemy However, in her autobiography, Clarke stated that Cagney had told her prior to that take what he planned to do. She said that her only genuine surprise came later, when she saw the grapefruit take of the scene appear in the final film, as it had been her understanding that they were shooting it only as a joke to amuse the crew.Clarke, Mae. Featured Player: An Oral Autobiography of Mae Clake, Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1996 According to Cagney, Clarke's ex-husband had the grapefruit scene timed, and would buy a ticket just before that scene went onscreen, go enjoy the scene, leave, then come back during the next show just in time to see only that scene again. The grapefruit-to-the-face incident from The Public Enemy is parodied years later in the 1961 Cagney movie One, Two, Three when Cagney threatens Otto (Horst Buchholz) with a half grapefruit but then decides against doing so. =Prologue and epilogue= The film featured a prologue \\"apprising the audience that the hoodlums and terrorists of the underworld must be exposed and the glamour ripped from them\\" and an epilogue \\"pointing the moral that civilization is on her knees and inquiring loudly as to what is to be done.\\" At the film's premiere in New York City, the film's prologue was preceded by a \\"brief stage tableau, with sinuous green lighting, which shows a puppet gangster shooting another puppet gangster in the back.\\" Music The soundtrack included the following songs: * \\"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\\" * \\"Hesitation Blues\\" * \\"Toot Toot Tootsie (Goodbye)\\" * \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" * \\"Brighten the Corner Where You Are\\" * \\"Smiles\\" * \\"I Surrender Dear\\" The music was performed by the Vitaphone Orchestra, led by conductor David Mendoza. Reception =Box office= According to Warner Bros records the film earned $464,000 domestically and $93,000 foreign. =Critical= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 100% \\"Fresh\\" rating based on 29 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.41/10. Andre Sennwald, who reviewed the film for The New York Times upon its April 1931 release, called it \\"just another gangster film at the Strand, weaker than most in its story, stronger than most in its acting, and, like most, maintaining a certain level of interest through the last burst of machine-gun fire\\"; Woods and Cagney give \\"remarkably lifelike portraits of young hoodlums\\" and \\"Beryl Mercer as Tom's mother, Robert Emmett O'Connor as a gang chief, and Donald Cook as Tom's brother, do splendidly.\\" Time magazine called The Public Enemy \\"well-told\\" and noted \\"Unlike City Streets, this is not a Hugoesque fable of gangsters fighting among themselves, but a documentary drama of the bandit standing against society. It carries to its ultimate absurdity the fashion for romanticizing gangsters, for even in defeat the public enemy is endowed with grandeur.\\" Variety called it \\"low-brow material given such workmanship as to make it high-brow\\" which attempts to \\"square everything [with] a foreword and postscript moralizing on the gangster as a menace to the public welfare.\\" A theatre in Times Square ran The Public Enemy 24 hours a day during its initial release. At the 4th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story, losing to The Dawn Patrol. Teaser trailer of The Public Enemy. Subsequent recognition In 1989, an animatronics version of a scene from The Public Enemy was incorporated into The Great Movie Ride at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida. In 1998, The Public Enemy was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". In 2001, the Sopranos episode \\"Proshai, Livushka\\" references scenes from the film which cause title character Tony Soprano to become overwhelmed by feelings of grief following his mother's death. In 2003 the character of Tom Powers was among the AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains, placing 42nd in the villain list. In 2008, the film appeared on one of the AFI's 10 Top 10 lists‚Äîthe best ten films in ten \\"classic\\" American film genres. The Public Enemy was listed as the eighth best in the gangster film genre. Re-releases The film was re-released in 1941 after the Production Code was put into effect. Three scenes from the film were cut because of the Code. One is of a markedly effeminate tailor measuring Tom for a suit, another where Mamie serves Matt breakfast in bed, and the third showing Tom being seduced when hiding out in a woman's apartment. These three scenes were later restored for all DVD and Blu- ray releases, and on Turner Classic Movies. The film was also re-released in 1954, with a written prologue added before the opening credits, advising that gangsters such as Tom Powers and Caesar \\"Rico\\" Bandello, the title character in Little Caesar (played by Edward G. Robinson), are a menace that the public must confront. Preservation status *As with many a Warner/First National pre-code talkie, a print has been in the Library of Congress since the '70s.

Kerouac also provided improvised narration. It features poets Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky and Gregory Corso, artists Larry Rivers and Alice Neel, musician David Amram, art dealer Richard Bellamy, Delphine Seyrig, dancer Sally Gross, and Pablo Frank, Robert Frank's son. Based on an incident in the life of Beat icon Neal Cassady and his wife, the painter Carolyn, the film tells the story of a railway brakeman whose wife invites a respected bishop over for dinner. However, the brakeman's bohemian friends crash the party, with comic results. Originally intended to be called The Beat Generation, the title Pull My Daisy was taken from the poem of the same name written by Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Cassady in the late 1940s. Part of the original poem was used as a lyric in Amram's jazz composition that opens the film. The Beat philosophy emphasized spontaneity, and the film conveyed the quality of having been thrown together or even improvised. Pull My Daisy was accordingly praised for years as an improvisational masterpiece. It was filmed in Alfred Leslie's loft at Fourth Ave. & 12th St. in Manhattan. Leslie and Frank discuss the film at length in Jack Sargeant's book Naked Lens: Beat Cinema. An illustrated transcript of the film's narration was also published in 1961 by Grove Press.

It is known as \\"grandpas beard\\" in French Polynesia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, Tillandsia usneoides In the United States from where it is most known, it is commonly found on the southern live oak (Quercus virginiana) and bald-cypress (Taxodium distichum) in the lowlands, swamps, and marshes of the mid-atlantic and southeastern United States from central Delaware to southeastern Virginia to Florida and west to Texas and southern Arkansas. This plant's specific name usneoides means \\"resembling Usnea\\". While it superficially resembles its namesake, Spanish moss is neither a moss nor a lichen like Usnea, and it is not native to Spain. Instead, it is a flowering plant (angiosperm) in the family Bromeliaceae (the bromeliads) which grows hanging from tree branches in full sun through partial shade. Formerly this plant has been placed in the genera Anoplophytum, Caraguata, and Renealmia. The northern limit of its natural range is Northampton County, Virginia, with colonial-era reports in southern MarylandJohn Ray 1688 where no populations are now known to be extant. The primary range is in the southeastern United States (including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands), through Argentina, growing where the climate is warm enough and has a relatively high average humidity. It has been introduced to similar locations around the world, including Hawaii and Australia.  Description  The plant consists of one or more slender stems bearing alternate thin, curved or curly, heavily scaled leaves long and broad, that grow vegetatively in chain-like fashion (pendant), forming hanging structures up to in length. The plant has no aerial roots and its brown, green, yellow, or grey flowers are tiny and inconspicuous. It propagates both by seed and vegetatively by fragments that blow on the wind and stick to tree limbs or are carried by birds as nesting material.  Ecology  Close-up of Spanish moss Spanish moss is an epiphyte which absorbs nutrients and water through its leaves from the air and rainfall. While it rarely kills the tree upon which it grows, it can occasionally become so thick that it shades the tree's leaves and lowers its growth rate. In the southern U.S., the plant seems to show a preference for growth on southern live oak (Quercus virginiana) and bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) because of these trees' high rates of foliar mineral leaching (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus) providing an abundant supply of nutrients to the plant, but it can also colonize other tree species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), crepe-myrtles (Lagerstroemia spp.), other oaks, and even pines. Spanish moss shelters a number of creatures, including rat snakes and three species of bats. One species of jumping spider, Pelegrina tillandsiae, has been found only on Spanish moss. Chiggers, though widely assumed to infest Spanish moss, were not present among thousands of other arthropods identified in one study.  Culture and folklore  seed capsule in Santee National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina. Due to its propensity for growing in subtropical humid southern locales like Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, east and south Texas, and extreme southern Virginia, the plant is often associated with Southern Gothic imagery and Deep South culture. One story of the origin of Spanish moss is called \\"The Meanest Man Who Ever Lived\\". The man's white hair grew very long and got caught on trees. Spanish moss was introduced to Hawaii in the 19th century, and became a popular ornamental and lei plant. On Hawai'i it is often called \\"Pele's hair\\" after Pele the Hawaiian goddess. The term \\"Pele's hair\\" is also used to refer to a type of filamentous volcanic glass.  Human uses  Spanish-moss under 20x magnification, showing scale-like trichomes. Spanish moss has been used for various purposes, including building insulation, mulch, packing material, mattress stuffing, and fiber. In the early 1900s it was used commercially in the padding of car seats. In 1939 over 10,000 tons of processed Spanish-moss was produced.Adams, Dennis. Spanish Moss: Its Nature, History and Uses. Beaufort County Library, SC. It is still collected today in smaller quantities for use in arts and crafts, or for beddings for flower gardens, and as an ingredient in the traditional wall covering material bousillage. In some parts of Latin America and Louisiana Spanish moss is used in Nativity scenes. In the desert regions of the southwestern United States, dried Spanish moss plants are sometimes used in the manufacture of evaporative coolers, colloquially known as swamp coolers (and in some areas as \\"desert coolers\\"). These are used to cool homes and offices much less expensively than using air conditioners. A pump squirts water onto a pad made of Spanish moss plants.

Biography Hughenden, home to the Disraelis Born in Brampford Speke, near Exeter in Devon, the only daughter of Commander John Viney-Evans and his cousin Eleanor Scrope-Viney (later Mrs Eleanor Yate). In 1815 at Clifton, Bristol Mary married Wyndham Lewis, MP (1780‚Äì1838), a colleague of Benjamin Disraeli. In August 1839, the year following Lewis's death, she married Disraeli at St George's, Hanover Square in London. Her fortune allowed him to purchase the estate of Hughenden in Buckinghamshire and to live in the style of an English gentleman.Dictionary of National Biography, Vol 5, p 1008 In recognition of Disraeli's services to the nation, Queen Victoria desired to ennoble him at the end of his first ministry. However, as he wished to remain in the House of Commons, his wife accepted the title in his place and was created Viscountess Beaconsfield, of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham, on 30 November 1868. (After Mary's death, Disraeli accepted the title of Earl of Beaconsfield.) Staid Victorians were often scandalised by Mary's uninhibited conversation but soon learned not to insult her within Disraeli's hearing.Hesketh Pearson Dizzy- the life and personality of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield Harper Collins New York 1951 p.214 Even Queen Victoria herself was said to be amused when Mary Anne commented, in response to a remark about some lady's pale complexion, \\"I wish you could see my Dizzy in his bath!\\" Once, at a house party where Lord Hardinge, a great soldier of the day, was in the room next to the Disraelis, Mary Anne announced at breakfast that she had slept the night before between the greatest soldier (Hardinge) and the greatest orator (Disraeli) of their times: Lady Hardinge was definitely not amused. The Disraeli family tomb, Hughenden Disraeli had been unimpressed by Mary Lewis when he first met her, but he came to understand that she was shrewder than her outward manner had led him to believe. She was a great help to him in editing the books he wrote, and spent 30 years taking care of him.Pearson p.75 She once joked in public that although he had married her for her money he would do it again for love.Kirsch, Adam, Benjamin Disraeli (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2008), p.106 In later life she became increasingly eccentric, both in conversation and appearance, but her husband's devotion and loyalty to her never faltered.Pearson, p214 She was some twelve years older than her husband but their romance continued until the day she died.Pearson p.214 In the spring of 1872 Mary became seriously ill, and by May it was clear that she was dying of stomach cancer. She rallied sufficiently to take a summer tour through the Home Counties with her husband. In November she felt well enough to hold a small dinner party for their close friends; but her condition deteriorated and she died on 15 December, at the age of eighty.Pearson pp.214=216 \\"There was no care which she could not mitigate, and no difficulty which she could not face. She was the most cheerful and courageous woman I ever knew\\" her husband wrote after her death.Pearson p.75 His great adversary William Ewart Gladstone, who had liked Mary, wrote him a letter of condolence. Disraeli, touched by this sympathy from a man who disliked him, replied that \\"Marriage is the greatest earthly happiness when founded on mutual sympathy.\\"Pearson p.216 She is buried with Disraeli in a vault in the Church of St Michael and All Angels Church, Hughenden, in Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, close to the Disraeli family home, Hughenden Manor.

He was nicknamed \\"the Raphael of flowers\\" and has been called the greatest botanical illustrator of all time.Schmidt, Alesandra M., and Trudy B. Jacoby. \\"Herbs to Orchids: Botanical Illustration in the Nineteenth Century\\". Watkinson Exhibition Catalogs, Paper 3, 1996. Redout√© was an official court artist of Marie Antoinette, and continued painting through the French Revolution and Reign of Terror. He survived the turbulent political upheaval to gain international recognition for his precise renderings of plants, which remain as fresh in the early 21st century as when first painted. He combined great artistic skills with a pleasing, ingratiating personality which assisted him with his influential patrons. After Queen Marie-Antoinette, his patrons included both of Napoleon's wives  Empress Jos√©phine and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma‚Äîas well as Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily wife of Louis Philippe I, the last king of France. Redout√© collaborated with the greatest botanists of his day and participated in nearly fifty publications depicting both the familiar flowers of the French court and plants from places as distant as Japan, America, South Africa, and Australia. He worked from live plants rather than herbarium specimens, which contributed to his fresh, subtle renderings. He was painting during a period in botanical illustration (1798 - 1837) that is noted for the publication of outstanding folio editions with coloured plates. Redout√© produced over published plates depicting over different species, many never rendered before. Of the French botanical illustrators employed in the French capital, Redout√© is the one which remains in the public consciousness today. He is seen as an important heir to the tradition of the Flemish and Dutch flower painters Brueghel, Ruysch, van Huysum and de Heem. Early life The fountain erected in honor of Pierre- Joseph Redout√© in Saint-Hubert, Belgium. Redout√© was born 10 July 1759, in Saint-Hubert, in the Belgian Province of Luxembourg. Both his father and grandfather were painters, and his elder brother, Antoine Ferdinand, was an interior decorator and scenery designer. He would never gain much in the way of formal education, instead leaving home at the age of 13 to earn his living as an itinerant painter, doing interior decoration, portraits and religious commissions. Eventually, in 1782, he made his way to Paris to join his brother in painting scenery for theaters. Painting career In Paris, Redout√© met the botanists Charles Louis L'H√©ritier de Brutelle and Ren√© Desfontaines, who steered him towards botanical illustration, a rapidly growing discipline. L'H√©ritier became his instructor, teaching him to dissect flowers and portray their specific characteristics with precision. L'Heritier also introduced Redout√© to members of the court at Versailles, following which Marie Antoinette became his patron. Redout√© eventually received the title of Draughtsman and Painter to the Queen's Cabinet. botanical illustration of Lilium superbum Cheveau, a Parisian dealer, brought the young artist to the attention of the botanical artist Gerard van Spaendonck at the Jardin du Roi, which would become the Jardin des Plantes of the National Museum of Natural History in 1793, after the Revolution. Van Spaendonck became another of Redout√©'s teachers, especially influencing his handling of watercolor. In 1786, Redout√© began to work at the National Museum of Natural History cataloguing the collections of flora and fauna and participating in botanical expeditions. In 1787, he left France to study plants at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew near London, returning the following year. In 1792 he was employed by the French Academy of Sciences. In 1798, Empress Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, the first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, became his patron and, some years later, he became her official artist. In 1809, Redout√© taught painting to Princess Ad√©la√Øde of Orl√©ans.  Later career and legacy  Flowers by the artist (Rosa centifolia, anemone, and clematis) After Empress Jos√©phine's death (1814), Redout√© had some difficult years until he was appointed a master of draughtsmanship for the National Museum of Natural History in 1822. In 1824, he gave some drawing classes at the museum. Many of his pupils were aristocrats or royalty. He became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1825. Although particularly renowned for his botanical exploration of roses and lilies, he thereafter produced paintings purely for aesthetic value. Redoute taught and painted up to the day he died of a stroke on 19 or 20 June 1840. He was survived by his wife, Marie-Marte Gobert, whom he married in 1786, and their two daughters. He was interred in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. A Brussels school bears his name: the Institut Redout√©-Peiffer in Anderlecht. Most of the Les Liliac√©es watercolours went from the Empress Jos√©phine to her son from her first marriage Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. Most of the watercolours of her Jardin de la Malmaison (gardens of Ch√¢teau de Malmaison) were acquired by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Redout√©'s paintings for Les Roses were bought by Charles X of France for his widowed daughter-in-law, Marie-Caroline of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duchess of Berry. Their whereabouts are virtually untraceable: in 1948 some were sold by Sotheby's in London and a few were acquired by the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation; later, single sheets have appeared repeatedly in auction. In 1985, 468 leaves were bought at a New York auction by an art dealer for approximately 5.5 million and then dispersed. In the 20th and 21st century, numerous exhibitions in Europe, the Americas and Australia have been devoted to the work of Redout√©. The Biodiversity Heritage Library, the Library of Congress and other libraries have made many of his works accessible online and reproductions of his prints are available from virtually all print and poster shops.

Books IIII were first published in 1590, and then republished in 1596 together with books IVVI. The Faerie Queene is notable for its form: it is one of the longest poems in the English language as well as the work in which Spenser invented the verse form known as the Spenserian stanza. On a literal level, the poem follows several knights as a means to examine different virtues, and though the text is primarily an allegorical work, it can be read on several levels of allegory, including as praise (or, later, criticism) of Queen Elizabeth I. In Spenser's \\"Letter of the Authors\\", he states that the entire epic poem is \\"cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devices\\", and the aim of publishing The Faerie Queene was to \\"fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline\\". Spenser presented the first three books of The Faerie Queene to Elizabeth I in 1589, probably sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh. The poem was a clear effort to gain court favour, and as a reward Elizabeth granted Spenser a pension for life amounting to ¬£50 a year, though there is no further evidence that Elizabeth I ever read any of the poem. This royal patronage elevated the poem to a level of success that made it Spenser's defining work. Summary Holiness defeats Error: an illustration from Book I, Part l of an 1895‚Äì1897 edition Book I is centered on the virtue of holiness as embodied in the Redcrosse Knight. Largely self-contained, Book I can be understood to be its own miniature epic. The Redcrosse Knight and his lady Una travel together as he fights the monster Errour, then separately after the wizard Archimago tricks the Redcrosse Knight into thinking that Una is unchaste using a false dream. After he leaves, the Redcrosse Knight meets Duessa, who feigns distress in order to entrap him. Duessa leads the Redcrosse Knight to captivity by the giant Orgoglio. Meanwhile, Una overcomes peril, meets Arthur, and finally finds the Redcrosse Knight and rescues him from his capture, from Duessa, and from Despair. Una and Arthur help the Redcrosse Knight recover in the House of Holiness, with the House's ruler Caelia and her three daughters joining them; there the Redcrosse Knight sees a vision of his future. He then returns Una to her parents' castle and rescues them from a dragon, and the two are betrothed after resisting Archimago one last time. Book II is centred on the virtue of Temperance as embodied in Sir Guyon, who is tempted by the fleeing Archimago into nearly attacking the Redcrosse Knight. Guyon discovers a woman killing herself out of grief for having her lover tempted and bewitched by the witch Acrasia and killed. Guyon swears a vow to avenge them and protect their child. Guyon on his quest starts and stops fighting several evil, rash, or tricked knights and meets Arthur. Finally, they come to Acrasia's Island and the Bower of Bliss, where Guyon resists temptations to violence, idleness, and lust. Guyon captures Acrasia in a net, destroys the Bower, and rescues those imprisoned there. Book III is centred on the virtue of Chastity as embodied in Britomart, a lady knight. Resting after the events of Book II, Guyon and Arthur meet Britomart, who wins a joust with Guyon. They separate as Arthur and Guyon leave to rescue Florimell, while Britomart rescues the Redcrosse Knight. Britomart reveals to the Redcrosse Knight that she is pursuing Sir Artegall because she is destined to marry him. The Redcrosse Knight defends Artegall and they meet Merlin, who explains more carefully Britomart's destiny to found the English monarchy. Britomart leaves and fights Sir Marinell. Arthur looks for Florimell, joined later by Sir Satyrane and Britomart, and they witness and resist sexual temptation. Britomart separates from them and meets Sir Scudamore, looking for his captured lady Amoret. Britomart alone is able to rescue Amoret from the wizard Busirane. Unfortunately, when they emerge from the castle Scudamore is gone. (The 1590 version with Books I‚ÄìIII depicts the lovers' happy reunion, but this was changed in the 1596 version which contained all six books.) Book IV, despite its title \\"The Legend of Cambell and Telamond or Of Friendship\\", Cambell's companion in Book IV is actually named Triamond, and the plot does not center on their friendship; the two men appear only briefly in the story. The book is largely a continuation of events begun in Book III. First, Scudamore is convinced by the hag Ate (discord) that Britomart has run off with Amoret and becomes jealous. A three-day tournament is then held by Satyrane, where Britomart beats Arthegal (both in disguise). Scudamore and Arthegal unite against Britomart, but when her helmet comes off in battle Arthegal falls in love with her. He surrenders, removes his helmet, and Britomart recognizes him as the man in the enchanted mirror. Arthegal pledges his love to her but must first leave and complete his quest. Scudamore, upon discovering Britomart's gender, realizes his mistake and asks after his lady, but by this time Britomart has lost Amoret, and she and Scudamore embark together on a search for her. The reader discovers that Amoret was abducted by a savage man and is imprisoned in his cave. One day Amoret darts out past the savage and is rescued from him by the squire Timias and Belphoebe. Arthur then appears, offering his service as a knight to the lost woman. She accepts, and after a couple of trials on the way, Arthur and Amoret finally happen across Scudamore and Britomart. The two lovers are reunited. Wrapping up a different plotline from Book III, the recently recovered Marinel discovers Florimell suffering in Proteus' dungeon. He returns home and becomes sick with love and pity. Eventually he confesses his feelings to his mother, and she pleads with Neptune to have the girl released, which the god grants. Book V is centred on the virtue of Justice as embodied in Sir Artegall. Book VI is centred on the virtue of Courtesy as embodied in Sir Calidore. Major characters alt=Heavily armed woman in armour, rescuing a semi-nude woman from a wild-eyed man and trampling on a blood-stained book * Acrasia, seductress of knights. Guyon destroys her Bower of Bliss at the end of Book 2. Similar characters in other epics: Circe (Homer's Odyssey), Alcina (Ariosto), Armida (Tasso), or the fairy woman from Keats' poem \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\". * Amoret(ta), the betrothed of Scudamour, kidnapped by Busirane on her wedding night, saved by Britomart. She represents the virtue of married love, and her marriage to Scudamour serves as the example that Britomart and Artegall seek to copy. Amoret and Scudamor are separated for a time by circumstances, but remain loyal to each other until they (presumably) are reunited. * Archimago, an evil sorcerer who is sent to stop the knights in the service of the Faerie Queene. Of the knights, Archimago hates Redcrosse most of all, hence he is symbolically the nemesis of England. * Artegall (or Artegal or Arthegal or Arthegall), a knight who is the embodiment and champion of Justice. He meets Britomart after defeating her in a sword fight (she had been dressed as a knight) and removing her helmet, revealing her beauty. Artegall quickly falls in love with Britomart. Artegall has a companion in Talus, a metal man who wields a flail and never sleeps or tires but will mercilessly pursue and kill any number of villains. Talus obeys Artegall's command, and serves to represent justice without mercy (hence, Artegall is the more human face of justice). Later, Talus does not rescue Artegall from enslavement by the wicked slave-mistress Radigund, because Artegall is bound by a legal contract to serve her. Only her death, at Britomart's hands, liberates him. Chrysaor was the golden sword of Sir Artegall. This sword was also the favorite weapon of Demeter, the Greek goddess of the harvest. Because it was \\"Tempred with Adamant\\", it could cleave through anything. * Arthur of the Round Table, but playing a different role here. He is madly in love with the Faerie Queene and spends his time in pursuit of her when not helping the other knights out of their sundry predicaments. Prince Arthur is the Knight of Magnificence, the perfection of all virtues. * Ate, a fiend from Hell disguised as a beautiful maiden. Ate opposes Book IV's virtue of friendship through spreading discord. She is aided in her task by Duessa, the female deceiver of Book I, whom Ate summoned from Hell. Ate and Duessa have fooled the false knights Blandamour and Paridell into taking them as lovers. Her name is possibly inspired by the Greek goddess of misfortune At√´, said to have been thrown from Heaven by Zeus, similar to the fallen angels. * Belphoebe, the beautiful sister of Amoret who spends her time in the woods hunting and avoiding the numerous amorous men who chase her. Timias, the squire of Arthur, eventually wins her love after she tends to the injuries he sustained in battle; however, Timias must endure much suffering to prove his love when Belphoebe sees him tending to a wounded woman and, misinterpreting his actions, flies off hastily. She is only drawn back to him after seeing how he has wasted away without her. Britomart viewing Artegall by Walter Crane from Book III, Part VII of an 1895‚Äì1897 edition * Britomart, a female knight, the embodiment and champion of Chastity. She is young and beautiful, and falls in love with Artegall upon first seeing his face in her father's magic mirror. Though there is no interaction between them, she travels to find him again, dressed as a knight and accompanied by her nurse, Glauce. Britomart carries an enchanted spear that allows her to defeat every knight she encounters, until she loses to a knight who turns out to be her beloved Artegall. (Parallel figure in Ariosto: Bradamante.) Britomart is one of the most important knights in the story. She searches the world, including a pilgrimage to the shrine of Isis, and a visit with Merlin the magician. She rescues Artegall, and several other knights, from the evil slave-mistress Radigund. Furthermore, Britomart accepts Amoret at a tournament, refusing the false Florimell. * Busirane, the evil sorcerer who captures Amoret on her wedding night. When Britomart enters his castle to defeat him, she finds him holding Amoret captive. She is bound to a pillar and Busirane is torturing her. The clever Britomart handily defeats him and returns Amoret to her husband. * Caelia, the ruler of the House of Holiness. * Calidore, the Knight of Courtesy, hero of Book VI. He is on a quest from the Faerie Queene to slay the Blatant Beast. * Cambell, one of the Knights of Friendship, hero of Book IV. Brother of Canacee and friend of Triamond. * Cambina, daughter of Agape and sister to Priamond, Diamond, and Triamond. Cambina is depicted holding a caduceus and a cup of nepenthe, signifying her role as a figure of concord. She marries Cambell after bringing an end to his fight with Triamond. * Colin Clout, a shepherd noted for his songs and bagpipe playing, briefly appearing in Book VI. He is the same Colin Clout as in Spenser's pastoral poetry, which is fitting because Calidore is taking a sojourn into a world of pastoral delight, ignoring his duty to hunt the Blatant Beast, which is why he set out to Ireland to begin with. Colin Clout may also be said to be Spenser himself. * Cymochles, a knight in Book II who is defined by indecision and fluctuations of the will. He and his fiery brother Pyrochles represent emotional maladies that threaten temperance. The two brothers are both slain by Prince Arthur in Canto VIII. * Chrysogonee, mother of Belphoebe and her twin Amoretta. She hides in the forest and, becoming tired, falls asleep on a bank, where she is impregnated by sunbeams and gives birth to twins. The goddesses Venus and Diana find the newborn twins and take them: Venus takes Amoretta and raises her in the Garden of Adonis, and Diana takes Belphoebe. * Despair, a distraught man in a cave, his name coming from his mood. Using just rhetoric, he nearly persuades Redcrosse Knight to commit suicide, before Una steps in. * Duessa, a lady who personifies Falsehood in Book I, known to Redcrosse as \\"Fidessa\\". As the opposite of Una, she represents the \\"false\\" religion of the Roman Catholic Church. She is also initially an assistant, or at least a servant, to Archimago. Florimell's Flight by Washington Allston * Florimell, a lady in love with the knight Marinell, who initially rejects her. Hearing that he has been wounded, she sets out to find him and faces various perils, culminating in her capture by the sea god Proteus. She is reunited with Marinell at the end of Book IV, and is married to him in Book V. * Guyon, the Knight of Temperance, the hero of Book II. He is the leader of the Knights of Maidenhead and carries the image of Gloriana on his shield. According to the Golden Legend, St. George's name shares etymology with Guyon, which specifically means \\"the holy wrestler\\". Prince Arthur, the Redcrosse Knight, and Una, illustrated by William Kent, 1751 * Marinell, \\"the knight of the sea\\"; son of a water nymph, he avoided all love because his mother had learnt that a maiden was destined to do him harm; this prophecy was fulfilled when he was stricken down in battle by Britomart, though he was not mortally wounded. * Orgoglio, an evil giant. His name means \\"pride\\" in Italian. * The Redcrosse Knight, hero of Book I. Introduced in the first canto of the poem, he bears the emblem of Saint George, patron saint of England; a red cross on a white background that is still the flag of England. The Redcrosse Knight is declared the real Saint George in Canto X. He also learns that he is of English ancestry, having been stolen by a Fay and raised in Faerieland. In the climactic battle of Book I, Redcrosse slays the dragon that has laid waste to Eden. He marries Una at the end of Book I, but brief appearances in Books II and III show him still questing through the world. * Satyrane, a wild half-satyr man raised in the wild and the epitome of natural human potential. Tamed by Una, he protects her, but ends up locked in a battle against the chaotic Sansloy, which remains unconcluded. Satyrane finds Florimell's girdle, which she drops while flying from a beast. He holds a three-day tournament for the right to possess the girdle. His Knights of Maidenhead win the day with Britomart's help. * Scudamour, the lover of Amoret. His name means \\"shield of love\\". This character is based on Sir James Scudamore, a jousting champion and courtier to Queen Elizabeth I. Scudamour loses his love Amoret to the sorcerer Busirane. Though the 1590 edition of The Faerie Queene has Scudamour united with Amoret through Britomart's assistance, the continuation in Book IV has them separated, never to be reunited. * Talus, an \\"iron man\\" who helps Arthegall to dispense justice in Book V. The name is likely from Latin \\"talus\\" (ankle) with reference to that which justice \\"stands on,\\" and perhaps also to the ankle of Achilles, who was otherwise invincible, or the mythological bronze man Talos. * Triamond, one of the Knights of Friendship, a hero of Book IV. Friend of Cambell. One of three brothers; when Priamond and Diamond died, their souls joined with his body. After battling Cambell, Triamond marries Cambell's sister, Canacee. * Una, the personification of the \\"True Church\\". She travels with the Redcrosse Knight (who represents England), whom she has recruited to save her parents' castle from a dragon. She also defeats Duessa, who represents the \\"false\\" (Catholic) church and the person of Mary, Queen of Scots, in a trial reminiscent of that which ended in Mary's beheading. Una is also representative of Truth. Themes =Allegory of virtue= Prince Arthur and the Faerie Queen by Henry Fuseli, circa 1788. A letter written by Spenser to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1590 contains a preface for The Faerie Queene, in which Spenser describes the allegorical presentation of virtues through Arthurian knights in the mythical \\"Faerieland\\". Presented as a preface to the epic in most published editions, this letter outlines plans for twenty- four books: twelve based each on a different knight who exemplified one of twelve \\"private virtues\\", and a possible twelve more centred on King Arthur displaying twelve \\"public virtues\\". Spenser names Aristotle as his source for these virtues, though the influences of Thomas Aquinas and the traditions of medieval allegory can be observed as well. It is impossible to predict how the work would have looked had Spenser lived to complete it, since the reliability of the predictions made in his letter to Raleigh is not absolute, as numerous divergences from that scheme emerged as early as 1590 in the first Faerie Queene publication. In addition to the six virtues Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice, and Courtesy, the Letter to Raleigh suggests that Arthur represents the virtue of Magnificence, which (\\"according to Aristotle and the rest\\") is \\"the perfection of all the rest, and containeth in it them all\\"; and that the Faerie Queene herself represents Glory (hence her name, Gloriana). The unfinished seventh book (the Cantos of Mutability) appears to have represented the virtue of \\"constancy.\\" =Religion= Una and the Lion by Briton Rivi√®re (1840‚Äì1920). The Faerie Queene was written during the Reformation, a time of religious and political controversy. After taking the throne following the death of her half-sister Mary, Elizabeth changed the official religion of the nation to Protestantism. The plot of book one is similar to Foxe's Book of Martyrs, which was about the persecution of the Protestants and how Catholic rule was unjust. Spenser includes the controversy of Elizabethan church reform within the epic. Gloriana has godly English knights destroy Catholic continental power in Books I and V. Spenser also endows many of his villains with \\"the worst of what Protestants considered a superstitious Catholic reliance on deceptive images\\". =Politics= The poem celebrates, memorializes, and critiques the House of Tudor (of which Elizabeth was a part), much as Virgil's Aeneid celebrates Augustus' Rome. The Aeneid states that Augustus descended from the noble sons of Troy; similarly, The Faerie Queene suggests that the Tudor lineage can be connected to King Arthur. The poem is deeply allegorical and allusive; many prominent Elizabethans could have found themselves partially represented by one or more of Spenser's figures. Elizabeth herself is the most prominent example. She appears in the guise of Gloriana, the Faerie Queen, but also in Books III and IV as the virgin Belphoebe, daughter of Chrysogonee and twin to Amoret, the embodiment of womanly married love. Perhaps also, more critically, Elizabeth is seen in Book I as Lucifera, the \\"maiden queen\\" whose brightly lit Court of Pride masks a dungeon full of prisoners. The poem also displays Spenser's thorough familiarity with literary history. The world of The Faerie Queene is based on English Arthurian legend, but much of the language, spirit, and style of the piece draw more on Italian epic, particularly Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso and Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered. Book V of The Faerie Queene, the Book of Justice, is Spenser's most direct discussion of political theory. In it, Spenser attempts to tackle the problem of policy toward Ireland and recreates the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. =Archetypes= Some literary works sacrifice historical context to archetypal myth, reducing poetry to Biblical quests, whereas Spenser reinforces the actuality of his story by adhering to archetypal patterns. Throughout The Faerie Queene, Spenser does not concentrate on a pattern \\"which transcends time\\" but \\"uses such a pattern to focus the meaning of the past on the present\\". By reflecting on the past, Spenser achieves ways of stressing the importance of Elizabeth's reign. In turn, he does not \\"convert event into myth\\" but \\"myth into event\\". Within The Faerie Queene, Spenser blurs the distinction between archetypal and historical elements deliberately. For example, Spenser probably does not believe in the complete truth of the British Chronicle, which Arthur reads in the House of Alma. In this instance, the Chronicle serves as a poetical equivalent for factual history. Even so, poetical history of this kind is not myth; rather, it \\"consists of unique, if partially imaginary, events recorded in chronological order\\". The same distinction resurfaces in the political allegory of Books I and V. However, the reality to interpreted events becomes more apparent when the events occurred nearer to the time when the poem was written. =Symbolism and allusion= Throughout The Faerie Queene, Spenser creates \\"a network of allusions to events, issues, and particular persons in England and Ireland\\" including Mary, Queen of Scots, the Spanish Armada, the English Reformation, and even the Queen herself. It is also known that James VI of Scotland read the poem, and was very insulted by Duessa ‚Äì a very negative depiction of his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. The Faerie Queene was then banned in Scotland. This led to a significant decrease in Elizabeth's support for the poem. Within the text, both the Faerie Queene and Belphoebe serve as two of the many personifications of Queen Elizabeth, some of which are \\"far from complimentary\\". Though it praises her in some ways, The Faerie Queene questions Elizabeth's ability to rule so effectively because of her gender, and also inscribes the \\"shortcomings\\" of her rule. There is a character named Britomart who represents married chastity. This character is told that her destiny is to be an \\"immortal womb\\" ‚Äì to have children. Here, Spenser is referring to Elizabeth's unmarried state and is touching on anxieties of the 1590s about what would happen after her death since the kingdom had no heir. The Faerie Queene's original audience would have been able to identify many of the poem's characters by analyzing the symbols and attributes that spot Spenser's text. For example, readers would immediately know that \\"a woman who wears scarlet clothes and resides along the Tiber River represents the Roman Catholic Church\\". However, marginal notes jotted in early copies of The Faerie Queene suggest that Spenser's contemporaries were unable to come to a consensus about the precise historical referents of the poem's \\"myriad figures\\". In fact, Sir Walter Raleigh's wife identified many of the poem's female characters as \\"allegorical representations of herself\\". Other symbols prevalent in The Faerie Queene are the numerous animal characters present in the poem. They take the role of \\"visual figures in the allegory and in illustrative similes and metaphors\\". Specific examples include the swine present in Lucifera's castle who embodied gluttony, and Duessa, the deceitful crocodile who may represent Mary, Queen of Scots, in a negative light. The House of Busirane episode in Book III in The Faerie Queene is partially based on an early modern English folktale called \\"Mr. Fox's Mottos\\". In the tale, a young woman named Lady Mary has been enticed by Mr. Fox, who resembles Bluebeard in his manner of killing his wives. She defeats Mr. Fox and tells about his deeds. Notably, Spenser quotes the story as Britomart makes her way through the House, with warning mottos above each doorway \\"Be bold, be bold, but not too bold\\". Composition =Spenser's intentions= While writing his poem, Spenser strove to avoid \\"gealous opinions and misconstructions\\" because he thought it would place his story in a \\"better light\\" for his readers. Spenser stated in his letter to Raleigh, published with the first three books, that \\"the general end of the book is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline\\". Spenser considered his work \\"a historical fiction\\" which men should read for \\"delight\\" rather than \\"the profit of the ensample\\". The Faerie Queene was written for Elizabeth to read and was dedicated to her. However, there are dedicatory sonnets in the first edition to many powerful Elizabethan figures. Spenser addresses \\"lodwick\\" in Amoretti 33, when talking about The Faerie Queene still being incomplete. This could be either his friend Lodowick Bryskett or his long deceased Italian model Ludovico Ariosto, whom he praises in \\"Letter to Raleigh\\". = Dedication = The dedicatory page of the 1590 edition of Spenser's Faerie Queene, reading: \\"To the most mightie and magnificent Empresse Elizabeth, by the grace of god, Queene of England, France and Ireland Defender of the Faith &c.;\\" The poem is dedicated to Elizabeth I who is represented in the poem as the Faerie Queene Gloriana, as well as the character Belphoebe. Spenser prefaces the poem with sonnets additionally dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton, Lord Burleigh, the Earl of Oxford, the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Cumberland, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Ormond and Ossory, High Admiral Charles Howard, Lord Hunsdon, Lord Grey of Wilton, Lord Buckhurst, Sir Francis Walsingham, Sir John Norris, Sir Walter Raleigh, the Countess of Pembroke (on the subject of her brother Sir Philip Sidney), and Lady Carew. =Social commentary= In October 1589, after nine years in Ireland, Spenser voyaged to England and saw the Queen. It is possible that he read to her from his manuscript at this time. On 25 February 1591, the Queen gave him a pension of fifty pounds per year. He was paid in four instalments on 25 March, 24 June, 29 September, and 25 December. After the first three books of The Faerie Queene were published in 1590, Spenser found himself disappointed in the monarchy; among other things, \\"his annual pension from the Queen was smaller than he would have liked\\" and his humanist perception of Elizabeth's court \\"was shattered by what he saw there\\". Despite these frustrations, however, Spenser \\"kept his aristocratic prejudices and predispositions\\". Book VI stresses that there is \\"almost no correlation between noble deeds and low birth\\" and reveals that to be a \\"noble person,\\" one must be a \\"gentleman of choice stock\\". Throughout The Faerie Queene, virtue is seen as \\"a feature for the nobly born\\" and within Book VI, readers encounter worthy deeds that indicate aristocratic lineage. An example of this is the hermit to whom Arthur brings Timias and Serena. Initially, the man is considered a \\"goodly knight of a gentle race\\" who \\"withdrew from public service to religious life when he grew too old to fight\\". Here, we note the hermit's noble blood seems to have influenced his gentle, selfless behaviour. Likewise, audiences acknowledge that young Tristram \\"speaks so well and acts so heroically\\" that Calidore \\"frequently contributes him with noble birth\\" even before learning his background; in fact, it is no surprise that Tristram turns out to be the son of a king, explaining his profound intellect. However, Spenser's most peculiar example of noble birth is demonstrated through the characterization of the Salvage Man. Using the Salvage Man as an example, Spenser demonstrated that \\"ungainly appearances do not disqualify one from noble birth\\". By giving the Salvage Man a \\"frightening exterior,\\" Spenser stresses that \\"virtuous deeds are a more accurate indication of gentle blood than physical appearance. On the opposite side of the spectrum, The Faerie Queene indicates qualities such as cowardice and discourtesy that signify low birth. During his initial encounter with Arthur, Turpine \\"hides behind his retainers, chooses ambush from behind instead of direct combat, and cowers to his wife, who covers him with her voluminous skirt\\". These actions demonstrate that Turpine is \\"morally emasculated by fear\\" and furthermore, \\"the usual social roles are reversed as the lady protects the knight from danger. Scholars believe that this characterization serves as \\"a negative example of knighthood\\" and strives to teach Elizabethan aristocrats how to \\"identify a commoner with political ambitions inappropriate to his rank\\". =Poetic structure= The Faerie Queene was written in Spenserian stanza, which Spenser created specifically for The Faerie Queene. Spenser varied existing epic stanza forms, the rhyme royal used by Chaucer, with the rhyme pattern ABABBCC, and the ottava rima, which originated in Italy, with the rhyme pattern ABABABCC. Spenser's stanza is the longest of the three, with nine iambic lines ‚Äì the first eight of them five footed, that is, pentameters, and the ninth six footed, that is, a hexameter, or Alexandrine ‚Äì which form \\"interlocking quatrains and a final couplet\\". The rhyme pattern is ABABBCBCC. Over two thousand stanzas were written for the 1590 Faerie Queene. Many see Spenser's purposeful use of archaic language as an intentional means of aligning himself with Chaucer and placing himself within a trajectory of building English national literary history. =Theological structure= Florimell saved by Proteus by Walter Crane, from book III, Part VII of an 1895‚Äì1897 edition. In Elizabethan England, no subject was more familiar to writers than theology. Elizabethans learned to embrace religious studies in petty school, where they \\"read from selections from the Book of Common Prayer and memorized Catechisms from the Scriptures\\". This influence is evident in Spenser's text, as demonstrated in the moral allegory of Book I. Here, allegory is organized in the traditional arrangement of Renaissance theological treatises and confessionals. While reading Book I, audiences first encounter original sin, justification and the nature of sin before analysing the church and the sacraments. Despite this pattern, Book I is not a theological treatise; within the text, \\"moral and historical allegories intermingle\\" and the reader encounters elements of romance. However, Spenser's method is not \\"a rigorous and unyielding allegory,\\" but \\"a compromise among conflicting elements\\". In Book I of The Faerie Queene the discussion of the path to salvation begins with original sin and justification, skipping past initial matters of God, the Creeds, and Adam's fall from grace. This literary decision is pivotal because these doctrines \\"center the fundamental theological controversies of the Reformation\\". =Sources= Myth and history During The Faerie Queene's inception, Spenser worked as a civil servant, in \\"relative seclusion from the political and literary events of his day\\". As Spenser laboured in solitude, The Faerie Queene manifested within his mind, blending his experiences into the content of his craft. Within his poem, Spenser explores human consciousness and conflict, relating to a variety of genres including sixteenth century Arthurian literature. The Faerie Queene was influenced strongly by Italian works, as were many other works in England at that time. The Faerie Queene draws heavily on Ariosto and Tasso. The first three books of The Faerie Queene operate as a unit, representing the entire cycle from the fall of Troy to the reign of Elizabeth. Using in medias res, Spenser introduces his historical narrative at three different intervals, using chronicle, civil conversation, and prophecy as its occasions. Despite the historical elements of his text, Spenser is careful to label himself a historical poet as opposed to a historiographer. Spenser notes this differentiation in his letter to Raleigh, noting \\"a Historiographer discourseth of affairs orderly as they were done‚Ä¶but a Poet thrusteth into the midst‚Ä¶and maketh a pleasing Analysis of all\\". Spenser's characters embody Elizabethan values, highlighting political and aesthetic associations of Tudor Arthurian tradition in order to bring his work to life. While Spenser respected British history and \\"contemporary culture confirmed his attitude\\", his literary freedom demonstrates that he was \\"working in the realm of mythopoeic imagination rather than that of historical fact\\". In fact, Spenser's Arthurian material serves as a subject of debate, intermediate between \\"legendary history and historical myth\\" offering him a range of \\"evocative tradition and freedom that historian's responsibilities preclude\\". Concurrently, Spenser adopts the role of a sceptic, reflected in the way in which he handles the British history, which \\"extends to the verge of self-satire\\". Medieval subject matter The Faerie Queene owes, in part, its central figure, Arthur, to a medieval writer, Geoffrey of Monmouth. In his Prophetiae Merlini (\\"Prophecies of Merlin\\"), Geoffrey's Merlin proclaims that the Saxons will rule over the Britons until the \\"Boar of Cornwall\\" (Arthur) again restores them to their rightful place as rulers. The prophecy was adopted by the Welsh and eventually used by the Tudors. Through their ancestor, Owen Tudor, the Tudors had Welsh blood, through which they claimed to be descendants of Arthur and rightful rulers of Britain. The tradition begun by Geoffrey of Monmouth set the perfect atmosphere for Spenser's choice of Arthur as the central figure and natural bridegroom of Gloriana. Reception =Diction= Since its inception four centuries ago, Spenser's diction has been scrutinized by scholars. Despite the enthusiasm the poet and his work received, Spenser's experimental diction was \\"largely condemned\\" before it received the acclaim it has today. Seventeenth-century philologists such as Davenant considered Spenser's use of \\"obsolete language\\" as the \\"most vulgar accusation that is laid to his charge\\". Scholars have recently observed that the classical tradition tucked within The Faerie Queene is related to the problem of his diction because it \\"involves the principles of imitation and decorum\\". Despite these initial criticisms, Spenser is \\"now recognized as a conscious literary artist\\" and his language is deemed \\"the only fitting vehicle for his tone of thought and feelings\\". Spenser's use of language was widely contrasted to that of \\"free and unregulated\\" sixteenth- century Shakespearian grammar. Spenser's style is standardized, lyrically sophisticated, and full of archaisms that give the poem an original taste. Sugden argues in The Grammar of Spenser's Faerie Queene that the archaisms reside \\"chiefly in vocabulary, to a high degree in spelling, to some extent in the inflexions, and only slightly in the syntax\\". Samuel Johnson also commented critically on Spenser's diction, with which he became intimately acquainted during his work on A Dictionary of the English Language, and \\"found it a useful source for obsolete and archaic words\\"; Johnson, however, mainly considered Spenser's (early) pastoral poems, a genre of which he was not particularly fond. The diction and atmosphere of The Faerie Queene relied on much more than just Middle English; for instance, classical allusions and classical proper names abound‚Äîespecially in the later books‚Äîand he coined some names based on Greek, such as \\"Poris\\" and \\"Phao lilly white.\\" Classical material is also alluded to or reworked by Spenser, such as the rape of Lucretia, which was reworked into the story of the character Amavia in Book Two. =Language= Spenser's language in The Faerie Queene, as in The Shepheardes Calender, is deliberately archaic, though the extent of this has been exaggerated by critics who follow Ben Jonson's dictum, that \\"in affecting the ancients Spenser writ no language.\\" Allowing that Jonson's remark may only apply to the Calendar, Bruce Robert McElderry Jr. states, after a detailed investigation of the FQs diction, that Jonson's statement \\"is a skillful epigram; but it seriously misrepresents the truth if taken at anything like its face value\\". The number of archaisms used in the poem is not overwhelming‚Äîone source reports thirty-four in Canto I of Book I, that is, thirty-four words out of a total forty-two hundred words, less than one percent. According to McElderry, language does not account for the poem's archaic tone: \\"The subject-matter of The Faerie Queene is itself the most powerful factor in creating the impression of archaism.\\" Examples of medieval archaisms (in morphology and diction) include: * Infinitive in -en: vewen 1. 201, 'to view'; * Prefix y- retained in participle: yclad, 1. 58, 254, 'clad, clothed'; * Adjective: combrous, 1. 203, 'harassing, troublesome'; * Verb: keepe, 1. 360, 'heed, give attention to'. Adaptation and derivative works Numerous adaptations in the form of children's literature have been made ‚Äì the work was a popular choice in the 19th and early 20th century with over 20 different versions written, with the earliest being E. W. Bradburn's Legends from Spencer's Fairy Queen, for Children (1829), written in the form of a dialogue between mother and children ‚Äì the 19th-century versions oft concentrated on the moral aspect of the tale. In terms of the English-speaking world adaptions of the work were relatively more popular in the United Kingdom than in the United States compared to contemporary works like Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, presumably due to the differences in appeal of the intended audiences (Royal court vs Ordinary people) and their relative appeal to the general American readership. The Edwardian era was particularly rich in adaptation for children, and the works richly illustrated, with contributing artists including A. G. Walker, Gertrude Demain Hammond, T. H. Robinson, Frank C. Pap√©, Brinsley Le Fanu and H. J. Ford. Additionally, Walter Crane illustrated a six-volume collection of the complete work, published 1897, considered a great example of the Arts and Crafts movement. In \\"The Mathematics of Magic\\", the second of Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp's Harold Shea stories, the modern American adventurers Harold Shea and Reed Chalmers visit the world of The Faerie Queene, where they discover that the greater difficulties faced by Spenser's knights in the later portions of the poem are explained by the evil enchanters of the piece having organized a guild to more effectively oppose them. Shea and Chalmers reveal this conspiracy to the knights and assist in its overthrow. In the process, Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie become respectively the wives of Shea and Chalmers and accompany them on further adventures in other worlds of myth and fantasy. A considerable part of Elizabeth Bear's \\"Promethean Age\\" series takes place in a Kingdom of Faerie which is loosely based on the one described by Spenser. As depicted by Bear, Spenser was aware of this Kingdom's existence and his work was actually a description of fact rather than invented fantasy; Queen Elizabeth I had a secret pact of mutual help with the Queen of Faerie; and such historical characters as Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare visited Faerie and had adventures there. According to Richard Simon Keller, George Lucas's Star Wars film also contains elements of a loose adaptation, as well as being influenced by other works, with parallels including the story of the Red Cross Knight championing Una against the evil Archimago in the original compared with Lucas's Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader. Keller sees extensive parallels between the film and book one of Spenser's work, stating \\"[A]lmost everything of importance that we see in the Star Wars movie has its origin in The Faerie Queene, from small details of weaponry and dress to large issues of chivalry and spirituality\\". References in popular culture The Netflix series The Crown references The Faerie Queene and Gloriana in season 1 episode 10, entitled \\"Gloriana\\". In the final scene, Queen Elizabeth II, portrayed by Claire Foy, is being photographed.

FAIA (9 January 1898 ‚Äì 19 June 1990) was a Danish architect and urban planner who was a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and a prolific writer of books and poetry. He was made a Royal Designer for Industry by the British Royal Society of Arts in 1947. Early life and education Steen Eiler Rasmussen was born on 19 February 1898 in Copenhagen to Lieutenant colonel and later general Christian Rasmussen and Anna Dorthea (Dori) Jung. He first apprenticed as a mason and then studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1916 to 1918. In 1919 he set up his own practice. Architecture and urban planning It was mainly as an urban planner that he made his name. He was part of the Danish Urban Planning Laboratory from 1924, as the Academy Council's representative, and its leader from 1942 to 1948. From 1932 to 1938 he worked at Copenhagen Municipality's Department for Urban Planning. Through his involvement in the Urban Planning Laboratory, he was an important part of the process which led to the Finger Plan which has governed the overall development of suburban Copenhagen ever since. He also co-planned the area Tingbjerg town (yellow brickstone and greens) with C.Th. S√∏rensen in Copenhagen North West, as well as the town H√∏rsholm. Among the buildings he has designed are Ringsted Town Hall, M√∏drehj√¶lpen (a social institution for women) in Copenhagen √ò and his own house in Rungsted Kyst H√∏rsholm, north of Copenhagen(1938).

He is most associated with the search for the source of the Nile and was the first European to reach Lake Victoria. He is also known for propounding the Hamitic hypothesis in 1863, in which he supposed that the Tutsi ethnic group were descendants of the biblical figure Ham, and had lighter skin and more Hamitic features than the Bantu Hutu over whom they ruled. Life Speke was born on 4 May 1827 at Orleigh Court, Buckland Brewer, near Bideford, North Devon. In 1844 he was commissioned into the British Army and posted to British India, where he served in the 46th Bengal Native Infantry under Sir Hugh Gough during the Punjab campaign and under Sir Colin Campbell during the First Anglo-Sikh War. He was promoted lieutenant in 1850 and captain in 1852. He spent his leave exploring the Himalayan Mountains and Mount Everest and once crossed into Tibet. In 1854 he made his first voyage to Africa, first arriving in Aden to ask permission of the Political Resident of this British Outpost to cross the Gulf of Aden and collect specimens in Somalia for his family's natural history museum in Somerset. This was refused as Somalia was considered rather dangerous. Speke then asked to join an expedition about to leave for Somalia led by the already famous Richard Burton who had Lt William Stroyan and Lt. Herne recruited to come along but a recent death left the expedition one person short. Speke was accepted because he had traveled in remote regions alone before, had experience collecting and preserving natural history specimens and had done astronomical surveying. Initially the party split with Burton going to Harrar, Abyssinia, and Speke going to Wadi Nogal in Somalia. During this trip Speke experienced trouble with the local guide, who cheated him; after they returned to Aden, Burton, who had also returned, saw that the guide was punished, jailed and killed. This incident probably led to larger troubles later on. Then all 4 men traveled to Berbera on the coast of Somalia from where they wanted to trek inland towards the Ogaden. While camped outside Berbera they were attacked at night by 200 spear-wielding Somalis. During this fracas Speke ducked under the flap of a tent to get a clearer view of the scene and Burton thought he was retreating and called for Speke to stand firm. Speke did so and then charged forward with great courage, shooting several attackers. The misunderstanding laid the foundation of their later disputes and dislikes. Stroyan was killed by a spear, Burton was seriously wounded by a javelin impaling both cheeks and Speke was wounded and captured; Herne came away unwounded. Speke was tied up and stabbed several times with spears, one thrust cutting through his thigh along his femur and exiting. Showing tremendous determination, he used his bound fists to give his attacker a facial punch; this gave him an opportunity to escape, albeit he was followed by a group of Somalis and had to dodge spears as he ran for his life. Rejoining Burton and Herne, the trio eventually managed to escape with a boat passing along the coast. The expedition was a severe financial loss and Speke's natural history specimens from his earlier leg were used to make up for some of it. Speke handed Burton his diaries that Burton used as an appendix in his own book on his travels to Harrar. It seemed unlikely that the two would join again and Burton believed that he would never lead an expedition to the interior of Africa, his fervent hope, after this failed journey. Search for the Nile source 1856‚Äì1859 Routes taken by the expeditions of Burton and Speke (1857‚Äì1858) and Speke and Grant (1863) In 1856, Speke and Burton went to East Africa to find the Great Lakes, which were rumored to exist in the center of the continent. It was hoped that the expedition would locate the source of the Nile. The journey, which started from Zanzibar Island in June 1857, where they stayed at the residence of Atkins Hamerton, the British consul, was extremely strenuous and both men fell ill from a variety of tropical diseases once they went inland. By 7 November 1857, they had travelled over 600 miles on foot and donkey and they reached Kazeh (Tabora), where they rested and recuperated among Arab slave traders who had a settlement there. In Kazeh Burton became gravely ill and Speke went temporarily blind as they travelled further west. After an arduous journey, the two arrived in Ujiji in February 1858 and became the first Europeans to reach Lake Tanganyika (although Speke was partially blind at this point and could not properly see the lake). They decided to explore the lake but it was vast and they only could get small canoes from the locals. Burton was too ill to journey and thus Speke crossed the lake with a small crew and some canoes to try to rent a larger vessel from an Arab who, they were told, had a large boat and lived on the west side of the lake. (Lake Tanganyika is over 400 miles long on the north-south axis but only about 30 miles wide.) During this trip Speke, marooned on an island, suffered severely when he became temporarily deaf after a beetle crawled into his ear and he tried to remove it with a knife. Unable to rent the larger vessel from the Arab, Speke returned. The pair were unable to explore Lake Tanganyika properly and they initially misunderstood that a river flowed out of it from the north side. A few weeks later Sidi Mubarak Bombay confirmed via locals that the river flowed into the lake; however, since neither man actually saw this river, this remained a source of speculation. =Speke's travels to Lake Victoria= They had also heard of a second lake to the north-east, and in May 1858, they decided to explore it on the way back to the coast. But Burton was too weak to make the trip and thus stayed in base camp when the main caravan halted again at Kazeh. Speke went on a 47-day side trip that was 452 miles up and down in which he took 34 men with Bombay and Mabruki as his captains and on 30 July 1858 became the first European to see Lake Victoria and the first to map it. It was this lake that eventually proved to be the source of the River Nile. However, much of the expedition's survey equipment had been lost at this point and thus vital questions about the height and extent of the lake could not be answered easily. Speke's eyes were still bothering him and he only saw a small part of the southern end of the lake and his view was blocked by islands in the lake so he could not judge the size of the lake well. However, Speke did estimate the elevation of Lake Victoria at 4000 feet by observing the temperature at which water boiled at that level. (This lake's being substantially higher than Lake Tanganyika did make it a more likely candidate for the source of the Nile.) From the beginning, the relationship of Speke and Burton was one of opposites; Burton considered Speke inferior linguistically and a less experienced traveler in remote regions (which was partially true) but Burton himself appears to have been jealous and far less able to relate to the safari caravan to keep the expedition motivated and moving (a vital factor as they were completely dependent on their safari crew). While Speke enjoyed hunting and thus provided the caravan with meat, Burton was not much interested in such pursuits. Burton was appointed the head of the expedition and considered Speke the second in command, although the pair seemed to have shared the hardships and labors of the journey pretty much evenly. Once it became clear that Speke might have found the source of the Nile the relationship deteriorated further. Why Burton did not journey back to Lake Victoria with Speke to make a better reconnoitre of the Lake after Speke returned to base camp in Kazeh is unclear. Burton was incapacitated and had to be carried by bearers but this had been true for a great deal of the trip. While Speke and Burton were instrumental in bringing the source of the Nile to the wider world and were the first to record and map this section of Africa, the efforts and labors of Sidi Mubarak Bombay and Mabruki were instrumental in discovering the lake. Bombay was captured as a child near Lake Nyasa by slave traders and was sold to Indian merchants on the coast of Africa who took him to Sindh. Thus he spoke Hindustani and after his master's death he sailed back to Zanzibar where Speke and Burton met and hired him. Both spoke Hindustani, which greatly facilitated the travel in the interior as Bombay spoke several native languages beside Swahili. Speke was much attached to Bombay and spoke highly of his honesty and conscientiousness. Bombay's efforts in dealing with hostile tribes, interpreting and keeping the safari crew on track was a great help to the expedition. Less is known of Mabruki, the other caravan leader, but he was later known as Mabruki Speke, and like Bombay became one of East Africa's great caravan leaders and was also a member of the Yao tribe like Bombay. Because of Speke's recommendations both Bombay and Mabruki served on Henry Stanley's 1871 expedition to find Livingstone. =Return to England and debate over the source of the Nile= On 26 September 1858 the return journey from Kazeh was started with 152 porters; both men had to return as their military leaves were coming to an end although Jeal contends that they could have extended the trip by asking for an extension as their clear mission statement of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) was to find the source of the Nile. The expedition had lost a great many people through desertions, disease and hostilities but in Kazeh, on the return journey, Mabruki had recruited local porters. Again Speke and Burton suffered from severe illnesses and had to be carried in a litter (machilla) by the porters some of the way. Once Speke and Burton were back on the coast they went by ship to Zanzibar and then traveled to Aden. When back at the coast Burton had written a letter to Norton Shaw of the Royal Geographical Society (which had partially sponsored the journey) in which Burton enclosed a map of Lake Victoria made by Speke and wrote \\"there are grave reasons for believing it (the map) to be the source of the principal feeder of the White Nile.\\" Once in Aden, Burton was not granted a medical certificate to travel and thus Speke left on HMS Furious and arrived in England on 8 May 1859. Burton was not far behind and he arrived on 21 May 1859. Now further disagreements developed; Burton maintained that they had promised each other in Aden not to make public announcements till they both were back in England and Burton accused Speke of a breach of promise by publicly claiming the source of the Nile was found on their trip. Burton now turned against the theory that Lake Victoria was the source of the Nile (and now said the river flowing out of the north side of Lake Tanganyika was the source) and thus also reversing himself from the position he took in the letter to Norton Shaw. In that same letter to Shaw, Burton had also stated that Speke would present his findings to the RGS as he was prevented from traveling as he was in poor health and would be in England a short time after Speke. Jeal concludes that Burton's claim of a promise from Speke to not go to the RGS was improbable. The jealousies and accusations between the two men got ever greater, further inflamed by their respective circles of friends and people who stood to gain from the feud such as book publishers and newspapers. Burton was still extremely weak and once he appeared in front of a committee of the RGS he was not able to make a convincing case for his leading a second expedition to settle the outstanding matters about the Nile. The rift widened, and perhaps became irreversible, when Speke was chosen to lead a subsequent expedition instead of Burton. The two presented joint papers concerning the expedition to the Royal Geographical Society on 13 June 1859. Second journey to the source of the Nile, 1860-1861 Together with James Augustus Grant, Speke left Portsmouth on 27 April 1860 and departed from Zanzibar in October 1860. The expedition approached the lake from the south west but Grant was often sick and was not able to travel with Speke much of the time. As during the first trip, in this period of history, Arab slave traders had created an atmosphere of great distrust towards any foreigners entering central Africa, and most tribes either fled or fought when encountering them as they assumed all outsiders to be potential slavers. Lacking a great deal of guns and soldiers, the only thing the expedition could do was make peace offerings to locals, and both men were severely delayed and their supplies depleted by demands for gifts and passage fees by smaller local chieftains. After numerous months of delays Speke reached Lake Victoria on 28 July 1862, and then travelled on the west side around Lake Victoria but only seeing it from time to time; but on the north side of the lake, Speke found the Nile flowing out of it and discovered the Ripon Falls. Speke introduces Grant to the Queen- Dowager of Uganda Whilst being at the court of Muteesa I, the Kabaka (or King) of Buganda, the local kingdom, who treated Speke with kindness, he was given two girls of about 12 and 18 out of the entourage of the Queen Mother. Speke took a serious liking to the elder, Meri, whom he fell in love with, according to his diaries (which were redacted when they were published as books later). While Meri proved loyal to Speke and fulfilled her task at being a \\"wife\\" as commanded by the Queen Mother, she showed no emotional attachment to Speke, and this left Speke heart-broken because he sought a relationship of mutual emotional feelings. Speke spent several months at the court of Mutesa and when he had given up winning Mere's heart, tried to arrange a better relationship for Mere with another man, without success it seems. Finally, given permission by Mutesa in June 1862 to leave, Speke then travelled down the Nile now reunited with Grant. Because of travel restrictions placed by the local chieftains, slave raiding parties, tribal wars and the difficulty of the terrain, Speke was not able to map the entire flow of the Nile from Lake Victoria north. Why he did not make more efforts to do so is not clear, but the enormous hardships of the journey must have played a large role. By January 1863 Speke and Grant reached Gondokoro in Southern Sudan, where he met Samuel Baker and his \\"wife\\". (Her name was Florence von Sass and she had been rescued by Baker from a slave market in Vidin during a hunting trip in Bulgaria.) Speke had expected to meet John Petherick and his wife Katherine at Gondokoro, as they had been sent by the RGS south along the Nile to meet Speke and Grant. However the Pethericks were not there but on a side expedition to trade ivory, as they had run out of funds for their expedition. This caused some hard feelings between Pethrick and Speke, and Baker played into this so he could assume a greater role as an explorer and co-discoverer of the Nile. Speke, via Baker's ship, then continued to Khartoum from which he sent a celebrated telegram to London: \\"The Nile is settled.\\" Speke's expedition did not resolve the issue, however. Burton claimed that because Speke had not followed the Nile from the place it flowed out of Lake Victoria to Gondokoro, he could not be sure they were the same river. Baker and Florence, meanwhile, stayed in Gondokoro and tried to settle the flow of the river from there to Lake Victoria by travelling south. They eventually, after tremendous hardships, such as being wracked by fevers and held up by rulers for months on end, found Lake Albert and the Murchison Falls. Return to London and third expedition Speke and Grant now returned to England where they arrived in June 1863 and were welcomed as genuine heroes. This did not last long in Speke‚Äôs case however; disputes with Burton, who was relentless in his criticisms and a very compelling public speaker and gifted writer, left Speke‚Äôs discoveries in less than an ideal light. Speke had also committed to write a book for John Blackwood which he found hard and time consuming as he was not naturally a gifted writer. He failed to give a good and full report to the RGS for many months and thus in effect was not defending his positions of discovery. In addition Speke had a public dispute with the Pethericks who had by and large acted according to their RGS instructions but Speke had felt they had not. All this led Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, to start disliking Speke and a third expedition, led by Speke, was becoming less likely as it would have to be funded by the people Speke was now not on good terms with. It appears that just as Burton had overplayed his hand after the first trip Speke now did the same. Now the RGS asked that a public debate should be held between Speke and Burton to try and settle the Nile. Death An obelisk dedicated to Speke stands in Kensington Gardens, London A debate was planned between Speke and Burton before the geographical section of the British Association in Bath on 16 September 1864, but Speke had died the previous afternoon from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while shooting at Neston Park in Wiltshire. A contemporary account of the events surrounding his death appeared in The Times: An inquest concluded that the death was accidental, a conclusion supported by his only biographer Alexander Maitland, though the idea of suicide has appealed to some. Bearing in mind, however, that the fatal wound was just below Speke's armpit, suicide seems most unlikely. Burton, however, could not set aside his own strong dislike of Speke and was vocal in spreading the idea of a suicide, claiming that Speke feared the debate. Speke was buried in St Andrew's Church, Dowlish Wake in Somerset, five miles away from the ancestral home of the Speke family. Source of the Nile is settled, 1874‚Äì1877 In 1874‚Äì1877, Henry Stanley mounted a new expedition and took a boat along the entire shore of Lake Victoria; he established that Lake Tanganyika and the Nile were not connected in any way, and he explored the headwaters of Lake Edward. It was now proven that Speke had been right all along, and that the Nile flowed from Lake Victoria via Ripon Falls and Murchison Falls to Lake Albert and from there to Gondokoro. =Scientific works= * Much of Speke's Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile is a description of the physical features of Africa's races, in whose condition he found \\"a strikingly existing proof of the Holy Scriptures.\\" Living alongside the negroes, Speke found a \\"superior race\\" of \\"men who were as unlike as they could be from the common order of the natives\\" due to their \\"fine oval faces, large eyes, and high noses, denoting the best blood of Abyssinia\\" ‚Äì; that is, Ethiopia. This \\"race\\" comprised many tribes, including the Watusi (Tutsi). Speke described their physical appearances as having retaineddespite the hair-curling and skin-darkening effects of intermarriage\\"a high stamp of Asiatic feature, of which a marked characteristic is a bridged instead of bridgeless nose\\".

If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat. The measuring instrument called a potentiometer is essentially a voltage divider used for measuring electric potential (voltage); the component is an implementation of the same principle, hence its name. Potentiometers are commonly used to control electrical devices such as volume controls on audio equipment. Potentiometers operated by a mechanism can be used as position transducers, for example, in a joystick. Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant power (more than a watt), since the power dissipated in the potentiometer would be comparable to the power in the controlled load. Nomenclature There are a number of terms in the electronics industry used to describe certain types of potentiometers: * slide pot or slider pot: a potentiometer that is adjusted by sliding the wiper left or right (or up and down, depending on the installation), usually with a finger or thumb * thumb pot or thumbwheel pot: a small rotating potentiometer meant to be adjusted infrequently by means of a small thumbwheel * trimpot or trimmer pot: a trimmer potentiometer typically meant to be adjusted once or infrequently for \\"fine-tuning\\" an electrical signal  Construction  Cutaway drawing of potentiometer showing parts: (A) shaft, (B) stationary carbon composition resistance element, (C) phosphor bronze wiper, (D) shaft attached to wiper, (E, G) terminals connected to ends of resistance element, (F) terminal connected to wiper. A mechanical stop (H) prevents rotation past end points. Single-turn potentiometer with metal casing removed to expose wiper contacts and resistive track Potentiometers consist of a resistive element, a sliding contact (wiper) that moves along the element, making good electrical contact with one part of it, electrical terminals at each end of the element, a mechanism that moves the wiper from one end to the other, and a housing containing the element and wiper. Many inexpensive potentiometers are constructed with a resistive element (B in cutaway drawing) formed into an arc of a circle usually a little less than a full turn and a wiper (C) sliding on this element when rotated, making electrical contact. The resistive element can be flat or angled. Each end of the resistive element is connected to a terminal (E, G) on the case. The wiper is connected to a third terminal (F), usually between the other two. On panel potentiometers, the wiper is usually the center terminal of three. For single-turn potentiometers, this wiper typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in. Another type is the linear slider potentiometer, which has a wiper which slides along a linear element instead of rotating. Contamination can potentially enter anywhere along the slot the slider moves in, making effective sealing more difficult and compromising long-term reliability. An advantage of the slider potentiometer is that the slider position gives a visual indication of its setting. While the setting of a rotary potentiometer can be seen by the position of a marking on the knob, an array of sliders can give a visual impression of settings as in a graphic equalizer or faders on a mixing console. The resistive element of inexpensive potentiometers is often made of graphite. Other materials used include resistance wire, carbon particles in plastic, and a ceramic/metal mixture called cermet. Conductive track potentiometers use conductive polymer resistor pastes that contain hard-wearing resins and polymers, solvents, and lubricant, in addition to the carbon that provides the conductive properties. trimmer potentiometers, or \\"trimpots\\", intended for infrequent adjustment Electronic symbol for pre-set potentiometer Multiturn potentiometers are also operated by rotating a shaft, but by several turns rather than less than a full turn. Some multiturn potentiometers have a linear resistive element with a sliding contact moved by a lead screw; others have a helical resistive element and a wiper that turns through 10, 20, or more complete revolutions, moving along the helix as it rotates. Multiturn potentiometers, both user-accessible and preset, allow finer adjustments; rotation through the same angle changes the setting by typically a tenth as much as for a simple rotary potentiometer. A string potentiometer is a multi-turn potentiometer operated by an attached reel of wire turning against a spring, enabling it to convert linear position to a variable resistance. User-accessible rotary potentiometers can be fitted with a switch which operates usually at the anti-clockwise extreme of rotation. Before digital electronics became the norm such a component was used to allow radio and television receivers and other equipment to be switched on at minimum volume with an audible click, then the volume increased, by turning a knob. Multiple resistance elements can be ganged together with their sliding contacts on the same shaft, for example, in stereo audio amplifiers for volume control. In other applications, such as domestic light dimmers, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob. Others are enclosed within the equipment and are intended to be adjusted to calibrate equipment during manufacture or repair, and not otherwise touched. They are usually physically much smaller than user-accessible potentiometers, and may need to be operated by a screwdriver rather than having a knob. They are usually called \\"preset potentiometers\\" or \\"trim[ming] pots\\". Some presets are accessible by a small screwdriver poked through a hole in the case to allow servicing without dismantling. = Resistance‚Äìposition relationship: \\"taper\\" = Size scaled 10k and 100k pots that combine traditional mountings and knob shafts with newer and smaller electrical assemblies. The \\"B\\" designates a linear (USA/Asian style) taper. The relationship between slider position and resistance, known as the \\"taper\\" or \\"law\\", is controlled by the manufacturer. In principle any relationship is possible, but for most purposes linear or logarithmic (aka \\"audio taper\\") potentiometers are sufficient. A letter code may be used to identify which taper is used, but the letter code definitions are not standardized. Potentiometers made in Asia and the USA are usually marked with an \\"A\\" for logarithmic taper or a \\"B\\" for linear taper; \\"C\\" for the rarely seen reverse logarithmic taper. Others, particularly those from Europe, may be marked with an \\"A\\" for linear taper, a \\"C\\" or \\"B\\" for logarithmic taper, or an \\"F\\" for reverse logarithmic taper. The code used also varies between different manufacturers. When a percentage is referenced with a non-linear taper, it relates to the resistance value at the midpoint of the shaft rotation. A 10% log taper would therefore measure 10% of the total resistance at the midpoint of the rotation; i.e. 10% log taper on a 10 kOhm potentiometer would yield 1 kOhm at the midpoint. The higher the percentage, the steeper the log curve.  Linear taper potentiometer  A linear taper potentiometer (linear describes the electrical characteristic of the device, not the geometry of the resistive element) has a resistive element of constant cross-section, resulting in a device where the resistance between the contact (wiper) and one end terminal is proportional to the distance between them. Linear taper potentiometers are used when the division ratio of the potentiometer must be proportional to the angle of shaft rotation (or slider position), for example, controls used for adjusting the centering of the display on an analog cathode- ray oscilloscope. Precision potentiometers have an accurate relationship between resistance and slider position. Beckman Helipot precision potentiometer  Logarithmic potentiometer  A logarithmic taper potentiometer is a potentiometer that has a bias built into the resistive element. Basically this means the center position of the potentiometer is not one half of the total value of the potentiometer. The resistive element is designed to follow a logarithmic taper, aka a mathematical exponent or \\"squared\\" profile. A logarithmic taper potentiometer is constructed with a resistive element that either \\"tapers\\" in from one end to the other, or is made from a material whose resistivity varies from one end to the other. This results in a device where output voltage is a logarithmic function of the slider position. Most (cheaper) \\"log\\" potentiometers are not accurately logarithmic, but use two regions of different resistance (but constant resistivity) to approximate a logarithmic law. The two resistive tracks overlap at approximately 50% of the potentiometer rotation; this gives a stepwise logarithmic taper. A logarithmic potentiometer can also be simulated (not very accurately) with a linear one and an external resistor. True logarithmic potentiometers are significantly more expensive. Logarithmic taper potentiometers are often used for volume or signal level in audio systems, as human perception of audio volume is logarithmic, according to the Weber‚ÄìFechner law.  Rheostat  The most common way to vary the resistance in a circuit is to use a rheostat. The word rheostat was coined about 1845 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, from the Greek rheos meaning \\"stream\\", and - -states (from histanai, \\" to set, to cause to stand\\") meaning \\"setter, regulating device\\",Brian Bowers (ed.), Sir Charles Wheatstone FRS: 1802-1875, IET, 2001 pp.104-105, . which is a two-terminal variable resistor. The term \\"rheostat\\" is becoming obsolete, with the general term \\"potentiometer\\" replacing it. For low-power applications (less than about 1 watt) a three-terminal potentiometer is often used, with one terminal unconnected or connected to the wiper. Where the rheostat must be rated for higher power (more than about 1 watt), it may be built with a resistance wire wound around a semicircular insulator, with the wiper sliding from one turn of the wire to the next. Sometimes a rheostat is made from resistance wire wound on a heat-resisting cylinder, with the slider made from a number of metal fingers that grip lightly onto a small portion of the turns of resistance wire. The \\"fingers\\" can be moved along the coil of resistance wire by a sliding knob thus changing the \\"tapping\\" point. Wire-wound rheostats made with ratings up to several thousand watts are used in applications such as DC motor drives, electric welding controls, or in the controls for generators. The rating of the rheostat is given with the full resistance value and the allowable power dissipation is proportional to the fraction of the total device resistance in circuit. Carbon-pile rheostats are used as load banks for testing automobile batteries and power supplies.

Through digital input signals, the resistance between two terminals can be adjusted, just as in an analog potentiometer. There are two main functional types: volatile, which lose their set position if power is removed, and are usually designed to initialise at the minimum position, and non-volatile, which retain their set position using a storage mechanism similar to flash memory or EEPROM. Usage of a digipot is far more complex than that of a simple mechanical potentiometer, and there are many limitations to observe; nevertheless they are widely used, often for factory adjustment and calibration of equipment, especially where the limitations of mechanical potentiometers are problematic. A digipot is generally immune to the effects of moderate long-term mechanical vibration or environmental contamination, to the same extent as other semiconductor devices, and can be secured electronically against unauthorised tampering by protecting the access to its programming inputs by various means. In equipment which has a microprocessor, FPGA or other functional logic which can store settings and reload them to the \\"potentiometer\\" every time the equipment is powered up, a multiplying DAC can be used in place of a digipot, and this can offer higher setting resolution, less drift with temperature, and more operational flexibility.  Membrane potentiometers  A membrane potentiometer uses a conductive membrane that is deformed by a sliding element to contact a resistor voltage divider. Linearity can range from 0.50% to 5% depending on the material, design and manufacturing process. The repeat accuracy is typically between 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm with a theoretically infinite resolution. The service life of these types of potentiometers is typically 1 million to 20 million cycles depending on the materials used during manufacturing and the actuation method; contact and contactless (magnetic) methods are available (to sense position). Many different material variations are available such as PET, FR4, and Kapton. Membrane potentiometer manufacturers offer linear, rotary, and application-specific variations. The linear versions can range from 9 mm to 1000 mm in length and the rotary versions range from 20 to 450 mm in diameter, with each having a height of 0.5 mm. Membrane potentiometers can be used for position sensing. Membrane Potentiometer White Paper For touch-screen devices using resistive technology, a two-dimensional membrane potentiometer provides x and y coordinates. The top layer is thin glass spaced close to a neighboring inner layer. The underside of the top layer has a transparent conductive coating; the surface of the layer beneath it has a transparent resistive coating. A finger or stylus deforms the glass to contact the underlying layer. Edges of the resistive layer have conductive contacts. Locating the contact point is done by applying a voltage to opposite edges, leaving the other two edges temporarily unconnected. The voltage of the top layer provides one coordinate. Disconnecting those two edges, and applying voltage to the other two, formerly unconnected, provides the other coordinate. Alternating rapidly between pairs of edges provides frequent position updates. An analog-to-digital converter provides output data. Advantages of such sensors are that only five connections to the sensor are needed, and the associated electronics is comparatively simple. Another is that any material that depresses the top layer over a small area works well. A disadvantage is that sufficient force must be applied to make contact. Another is that the sensor requires occasional calibration to match touch location to the underlying display. (Capacitive sensors require no calibration or contact force, only proximity of a finger or other conductive object. However, they are significantly more complex.)  Applications  Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant amounts of power (more than a watt or so). Instead they are used to adjust the level of analog signals (for example volume controls on audio equipment), and as control inputs for electronic circuits. For example, a light dimmer uses a potentiometer to control the switching of a TRIAC and so indirectly to control the brightness of lamps. Preset potentiometers are widely used throughout electronics wherever adjustments must be made during manufacturing or servicing. User-actuated potentiometers are widely used as user controls, and may control a very wide variety of equipment functions. The widespread use of potentiometers in consumer electronics declined in the 1990s, with rotary incremental encoders, up/down push-buttons, and other digital controls now more common. However they remain in many applications, such as volume controls and as position sensors. = Audio control = faders) Low-power potentiometers, both slide and rotary, are used to control audio equipment, changing loudness, frequency attenuation, and other characteristics of audio signals. The 'log pot', that is, a potentiometer has a resistance, taper, or, \\"curve\\" (or law) of a logarithmic (log) form, is used as the volume control in audio power amplifiers, where it is also called an \\"audio taper pot\\", because the amplitude response of the human ear is approximately logarithmic. It ensures that on a volume control marked 0 to 10, for example, a setting of 5 sounds subjectively half as loud as a setting of 10. There is also an anti-log pot or reverse audio taper which is simply the reverse of a logarithmic potentiometer. It is almost always used in a ganged configuration with a logarithmic potentiometer, for instance, in an audio balance control. Potentiometers used in combination with filter networks act as tone controls or equalizers. In audio systems, the word linear, is sometimes applied in a confusing way to describe slide potentiometers because of the straight line nature of the physical sliding motion. The word linear when applied to a potentiometer regardless of being a slide or rotary type, describes a linear relationship of the pot's position versus the measured value of the pot's tap (wiper or electrical output) pin. = Television = Potentiometers were formerly used to control picture brightness, contrast, and color response. A potentiometer was often used to adjust \\"vertical hold\\", which affected the synchronization between the receiver's internal sweep circuit (sometimes a multivibrator) and the received picture signal, along with other things such as audio-video carrier offset, tuning frequency (for push-button sets) and so on. It also helps in frequency modulation of waves. = Motion control = Potentiometers can be used as position feedback devices in order to create \\"closed loop\\" control, such as in a servomechanism. This method of motion control used in the DC Motor is the simplest method of measuring the angle, speed and displacement. = Transducers = Potentiometers are also very widely used as a part of displacement transducers because of the simplicity of construction and because they can give a large output signal. =Computation= In analog computers, high precision potentiometers are used to scale intermediate results by desired constant factors, or to set initial conditions for a calculation. A motor-driven potentiometer may be used as a function generator, using a non-linear resistance card to supply approximations to trigonometric functions. For example, the shaft rotation might represent an angle, and the voltage division ratio can be made proportional to the cosine of the angle.  Theory of operation  A potentiometer with a resistive load, showing equivalent fixed resistors for clarity. The potentiometer can be used as a voltage divider to obtain a manually adjustable output voltage at the slider (wiper) from a fixed input voltage applied across the two ends of the potentiometer. This is their most common use. The voltage across can be calculated by: V_\\\\mathrm{L} = { R_2 R_\\\\mathrm{L} \\\\over R_1 R_\\\\mathrm{L} + R_2 R_\\\\mathrm{L} + R_1 R_2}\\\\cdot V_s. If is large compared to the other resistances (like the input to an operational amplifier), the output voltage can be approximated by the simpler equation: V_\\\\mathrm{L} = { R_2 \\\\over R_1 + R_2 }\\\\cdot V_s. (dividing throughout by and cancelling terms with as denominator) As an example, assume V_\\\\mathrm{S} = 10\\\\ \\\\mathrm{V}, R_1 = 1\\\\ \\\\mathrm{k \\\\Omega}, R_2 = 2\\\\ \\\\mathrm{k \\\\Omega}, and R_\\\\mathrm{L} = 100\\\\ \\\\mathrm{k \\\\Omega}. Since the load resistance is large compared to the other resistances, the output voltage will be approximately: {2\\\\ \\\\mathrm{k \\\\Omega} \\\\over 1\\\\ \\\\mathrm{k \\\\Omega} + 2\\\\ \\\\mathrm{k \\\\Omega} } \\\\cdot 10\\\\ \\\\mathrm{V} = {2 \\\\over 3} \\\\cdot 10\\\\ \\\\mathrm{V} \\\\approx 6.667\\\\ \\\\mathrm{V}. Because of the load resistance, however, it will actually be slightly lower: . One of the advantages of the potential divider compared to a variable resistor in series with the source is that, while variable resistors have a maximum resistance where some current will always flow, dividers are able to vary the output voltage from maximum () to ground (zero volts) as the wiper moves from one end of the potentiometer to the other. There is, however, always a small amount of contact resistance. In addition, the load resistance is often not known and therefore simply placing a variable resistor in series with the load could have a negligible effect or an excessive effect, depending on the load.

The avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of modernism, as distinct from postmodernism. Many artists have aligned themselves with the avant-garde movement, and still continue to do so, tracing their history from Dada through the Situationists and to postmodern artists such as the Language poets around 1981.UBU Web List of artists from Dada to the present day aligning themselves with the avant-garde The avant-garde also promotes radical social reforms. It was this meaning that was evoked by the Saint Simonian Olinde Rodrigues in his essay \\"L'artiste, le savant et l'industriel\\" (\\"The artist, the scientist and the industrialist\\", 1825), which contains the first recorded use of \\"avant- garde\\" in its now customary sense: there, Rodrigues calls on artists to \\"serve as [the people's] avant-garde\\", insisting that \\"the power of the arts is indeed the most immediate and fastest way\\" to social, political and economic reform.Matei Calinescu, The Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-Garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism (Durham: Duke University Press, 1987).  History  The term was originally used by the French military to refer to a small reconnoitre group that scouted ahead of the main force. It also became associated with left-wing French radicals in the nineteenth century who were agitating for political reform. At some point in the middle of that century the term was linked to art through the idea that art is an instrument for social change. Only toward the end of the nineteenth did l'art d'avant-garde begin to break away from its identification with left-wing social causes to become more aligned with cultural and artistic issues. This trend toward increased emphasis on aesthetic issues has continued to the present. Avant- garde today generally refers to groups of intellectuals, writers, and artists, including architects, who voice ideas and experiment with artistic approaches that challenge current cultural values. Avant-garde ideas, especially if they embrace social issues, often are gradually assimilated by the societies they confront. The radicals of yesterday become mainstream, creating the environment for a new generation of radicals to emerge. Theories Marcel Duchamp, Fountain, 1917, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz Several writers have attempted to map the parameters of avant-garde activity. The Italian essayist Renato Poggioli provides one of the earliest analyses of vanguardism as a cultural phenomenon in his 1962 book Teoria dell'arte d'avanguardia (The Theory of the Avant-Garde).Sascha Bru and Gunther Martens, The Invention of Politics in the European Avant-Garde (1906‚Äì1940) (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2006), p. 21. . Surveying the historical, social, psychological and philosophical aspects of vanguardism, Poggioli reaches beyond individual instances of art, poetry, and music to show that vanguardists may share certain ideals or values which manifest themselves in the non-conformist lifestyles they adopt: He sees vanguard culture as a variety or subcategory of Bohemianism., translated from the Italian by Gerald Fitzgerald Other authors have attempted both to clarify and to extend Poggioli's study. The German literary critic Peter B√ºrger's Theory of the Avant-Garde (1974) looks at the Establishment's embrace of socially critical works of art and suggests that in complicity with capitalism, \\"art as an institution neutralizes the political content of the individual work\\". English translation (University of Minnesota Press) 1984: 90. B√ºrger's essay also greatly influenced the work of contemporary American art-historians such as the German Benjamin H. D. Buchloh (born 1941). Buchloh, in the collection of essays Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry (2000) critically argues for a dialectical approach to these positions.Benjamin Buchloh, Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry: Essays on European and American Art from 1955 to 1975 (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001) . Subsequent criticism theorized the limitations of these approaches, noting their circumscribed areas of analysis, including Eurocentric, chauvinist, and genre-specific definitions. James M. Harding: Cutting Performances: Collage Events, Feminist Artists, and the American Avant-Garde (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2010). Relation to mainstream society The concept of avant-garde refers primarily to artists, writers, composers and thinkers whose work is opposed to mainstream cultural values and often has a trenchant social or political edge. Many writers, critics and theorists made assertions about vanguard culture during the formative years of modernism, although the initial definitive statement on the avant-garde was the essay Avant-Garde and Kitsch by New York art critic Clement Greenberg, published in Partisan Review in 1939. Greenberg argued that vanguard culture has historically been opposed to \\"high\\" or \\"mainstream\\" culture, and that it has also rejected the artificially synthesized mass culture that has been produced by industrialization. Each of these media is a direct product of Capitalism‚Äîthey are all now substantial industries‚Äîand as such they are driven by the same profit-fixated motives of other sectors of manufacturing, not the ideals of true art. For Greenberg, these forms were therefore kitsch: phony, faked or mechanical culture, which often pretended to be more than they were by using formal devices stolen from vanguard culture. For instance, during the 1930s the advertising industry was quick to take visual mannerisms from surrealism, but this does not mean that 1930s advertising photographs are truly surreal. Max Horkheimer (front left), Theodor Adorno (front right), and J√ºrgen Habermas in the background, right, in 1965 at Heidelberg, West Germany. Various members of the Frankfurt School argued similar views: thus Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in their essay The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass-Deception (1944), and also Walter Benjamin in his highly influential \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\" (1935, rev. 1939).Walter Benjamin, \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\" Where Greenberg used the German word kitsch to describe the antithesis of avant-garde culture, members of the Frankfurt School coined the term \\"mass culture\\" to indicate that this bogus culture is constantly being manufactured by a newly emerged culture industry (comprising commercial publishing houses, the movie industry, the record industry, and the electronic media).Theodor W. Adorno (1963), \\"Culture Industry Reconsidered: Selected Essays on Mass Culture\\", London: Routledge, 1991 They also pointed out that the rise of this industry meant that artistic excellence was displaced by sales figures as a measure of worth: a novel, for example, was judged meritorious solely on whether it became a best-seller, music succumbed to ratings charts and to the blunt commercial logic of the Gold disc. In this way the autonomous artistic merit so dear to the vanguardist was abandoned and sales increasingly became the measure, and justification, of everything. Consumer culture now ruled. The avant-garde's co-option by the global capitalist market, by neoliberal economies, and by what Guy Debord called The Society of the Spectacle, have made contemporary critics speculate on the possibility of a meaningful avant-garde today. Paul Mann's Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde demonstrates how completely the avant-garde is embedded within institutional structures today, a thought also pursued by Richard Schechner in his analyses of avant-garde performance.Richard Schechner, \\"The Conservative Avant-Garde.\\" New Literary History 41.4 (Autumn 2010): 895‚Äì913. Despite the central arguments of Greenberg, Adorno, and others, various sectors of the mainstream culture industry have co-opted and misapplied the term \\"avant- garde\\" since the 1960s, chiefly as a marketing tool to publicise popular music and commercial cinema. It has become common to describe successful rock musicians and celebrated film-makers as \\"avant-garde\\", the very word having been stripped of its proper meaning. Noting this important conceptual shift, major contemporary theorists such as Matei Calinescu in Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism (1987), and Hans Bertens in The Idea of the Postmodern: A History (1995), have suggested that this is a sign our culture has entered a new post-modern age, when the former modernist ways of thinking and behaving have been rendered redundant.Calinescu 1987,; Bertens 1995. Nevertheless, an incisive critique of vanguardism as against the views of mainstream society was offered by the New York critic Harold Rosenberg in the late 1960s.Harold Rosenberg, The De- Definition of Art: Action Art to Pop to Earthworks (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 219 . Originally published: New York: Horizon Press, 1972; reprinted New York: Collier Books, 1973. Trying to strike a balance between the insights of Renato Poggioli and the claims of Clement Greenberg, Rosenberg suggested that from the mid-1960s onward progressive culture ceased to fulfill its former adversarial role. Since then it has been flanked by what he called \\"avant-garde ghosts to the one side, and a changing mass culture on the other\\", both of which it interacts with to varying degrees. This has seen culture become, in his words, \\"a profession one of whose aspects is the pretense of overthrowing it.\\"George Dickie, \\"\\"Symposium on Marxist Aesthetic Thought: Commentary on the Papers by Rudich, San Juan, and Morawski\\", Arts in Society: Art and Social Experience: Our Changing Outlook on Culture 12, no. 2 (Summer‚ÄìFall 1975): p. 232. Examples =Music= Avant-garde in music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner.David Nicholls (ed.), The Cambridge History of American Music (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 122‚Äì24. The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether.Jim Samson, \\"Avant garde\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).

Laurie Anderson, and Diamanda Gal√°s. There is another definition of \\"Avant-gardism\\" that distinguishes it from \\"modernism\\": Peter B√ºrger, for example, says avant-gardism rejects the \\"institution of art\\" and challenges social and artistic values, and so necessarily involves political, social, and cultural factors. According to the composer and musicologist Larry Sitsky, modernist composers from the early 20th century who do not qualify as avant-gardists include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Igor Stravinsky; later modernist composers who do not fall into the category of avant-gardists include Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Witold Lutos≈Çawski, and Luciano Berio, since \\"their modernism was not conceived for the purpose of goading an audience.\\"Larry Sitsky, Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xv. . The 1960s saw a wave of free and avant- garde music in jazz genre, represented by artists such as Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, John Coltrane and Miles Davis.Anon. Avant- Garde Jazz. AllMusic.com, n.d. In the rock music of the 1970s, the \\"art\\" descriptor was generally understood to mean \\"aggressively avant-garde\\" or \\"pretentiously progressive\\". Post-punk artists from the late 1970s rejected traditional rock sensibilities in favor of an avant-garde aesthetic. =Theatre= Whereas the avant-garde has a significant history in 20th- century music, it is more pronounced in theatre and performance art, and often in conjunction with music and sound design innovations, as well as developments in visual media design.

Caprifolium Mill.) are arching shrubs or twining vines in the family Caprifoliaceae, native to northern latitudes in North America and Eurasia. Approximately 180 species of honeysuckle have been identified in North America and Eurasia. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is an aggressive, highly invasive species considered as a significant pest on the continents of North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa. Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist. Description Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) Most species of Lonicera are hardy twining climbers, with a minority of shrubby habit. Some species (including Lonicera hildebrandiana from the Himalayan foothills and L. etrusca from the Mediterranean) are tender and can only be grown outside in subtropical zones. The leaves are opposite, simple oval, 1-10 cm long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen. Many of the species have sweetly scented, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar, and most flowers are borne in clusters of two (leading to the common name of \\"twinberry\\" for certain North American species). Both shrubby and vining sorts have strongly fibrous stems which have been used for binding and textiles. The fruit is a red, blue or black spherical or elongated berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly poisonous, but in a few (notably Lonicera caerulea) they are edible and grown for home use and commerce. Most honeysuckle berries are attractive to wildlife, which has led to species such as L. japonica and L. maackii spreading invasively outside of their home ranges. Many species of Lonicera are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species‚Äîsee a list of Lepidoptera that feed on honeysuckles. =Invasive species= The spread of L. japonica in North America began in the United States in 1806, when it was widely cultivated by the 1860s. It was first discovered in Canada in Ontario forests in 1976, and became invasive by 2007. L. japonica was introduced in Australia between 1820-40. Several species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa. Invasive species include L. japonica, L. maackii, L. morrowii, L. tatarica, and the hybrid between the last two, L. √ó bella. Cultivation Honeysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in early summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties. The hardy climbing types need their roots in shade, and their flowering tops in sunlight or very light shade. Varieties need to be chosen with care, as they can become substantial. Cultivars of the dense, small-leaved L. nitida are used as low, narrow hedges. The following hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: *L. √ó heckrottii ‚ÄòGold Flame‚Äô *L. ‚ÄòMandarin‚Äô *L. √ó purpusii 'Winter Beauty' *L. √ó tellmanniana Other cultivars are dealt with under their species names. The honeysuckle species Lonicera japonica is grown as a commercial crop for traditional Chinese medicine use. Phytochemicals and sensory effects Honeysuckle is renowned for its colorful, fragrant flowers and variously colored fruit, indicating the presence of complex phytochemicals underlying these properties. Component analyses of berries from 27 different cultivars and 3 genotypes of edible honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea var. kamtschatica) showed the presence of iridoids, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids. While sugars determine the level of sweetness in the berries, organic acids and polyphenols are responsible for the sour taste and tartness. Some 51 of the same compounds in berries are found in flowers, although the proportions of these compounds varied among cultivars studied. Interaction with other species Many insects in the order Lepidoptera visit honeysuckles as a food source. An example of this is the moth Deilephila elpenor.

scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.Flora Europaea: SyringaFlora of China: ‰∏ÅÈ¶ôÂ±û ding xiang shu SyringaFlora of Pakistan: SyringaGermplasm Resources Information Network: Syringa The genus is most closely related to Ligustrum (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.University of Oxford, Oleaceae information site: New classification of the Oleaceae Lilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including copper underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson's copper underwing. Description Purple lilac bush They are small trees, ranging in size from tall, with stems up to diameter. The leaves are opposite (occasionally in whorls of three) in arrangement, and their shape is simple and heart-shaped to broad lanceolate in most species, but pinnate in a few species (e.g. S. protolaciniata, S. pinnatifolia). The flowers are produced in spring, each flower being in diameter with a four-lobed corolla, the corolla tube narrow, long; they are monoecious, with fertile stamens and stigma in each flower. The usual flower colour is a shade of purple (often a light purple or lilac), but white, pale yellow and pink, and even a dark burgundy color are also found. The flowers grow in large panicles, and in several species have a strong fragrance. Flowering varies between mid spring to early summer, depending on the species. The fruit is a dry, brown capsule, splitting in two at maturity to release the two winged seeds.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . Taxonomy and etymology The genus Syringa was first formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus and the description was published in Species Plantarum. The genus name Syringa is derived from Ancient Greek word syrinx meaning \\"pipe\\" or \\"tube\\" and refers to the hollow branches of S. vulgaris.http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=syringe The English common name \\"lilac\\" is from the French lilachttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lilacVedel, H., & Lange, J. (1960). Trees and Bushes in Wood and Hedgerow. Metheun & Co. Ltd., London. via the Arabic ŸÑŸäŸÑŸÉ (\\"lilak\\") from Persian ŸÜ€åŸÑ⁄© (\\"nilak\\") meaning \\"bluish\\".etymonline.com Cultivation and uses A white, double-flowered cultivar Dormant lilac buds Lilacs are popular shrubs in parks and gardens throughout the temperate zone, and several hybrids and numerous cultivars have been developed. The term French lilac is often used to refer to modern double- flowered cultivars, thanks to the work of prolific breeder Victor Lemoine. Lilacs grow most successfully in well-drained soils, particularly those based on chalk.Hillier Nurseries, The Hillier Manual of Trees and Shrubs, David and Charles, 1998, p. 659 They flower on old wood, and produce more flowers if unpruned. If pruned, the plant responds by producing fast-growing young vegetative growth with no flowers, in an attempt to restore the removed branches. Lilac bushes can be prone to powdery mildew disease. The wood of lilac is close-grained, diffuse-porous, extremely hard and one of the densest in Europe. The sapwood is typically cream-coloured and the heartwood has various shades of brown and purple. Lilac wood has traditionally been used for engraving, musical instruments, knife handles etc. When drying, the wood has a tendency to be encurved as a twisted material, and to split into narrow sticks. Symbolism Lilacs are often considered to symbolize love (see language of flowers). In Greece, Lebanon, and Cyprus, the lilac is strongly associated with Easter time because it flowers around that time; it is consequently called paschalia. In the poem \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\", by Walt Whitman, lilacs are a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Syringa vulgaris is the state flower of New Hampshire, because it \\"is symbolic of that hardy character of the men and women of the Granite State\\" (New Hampshire Revised Statute Annotated (RSA) 3:5). Festivals Royal Botanical Gardens near Hamilton, Ontario in Canada. Several locations in North America hold annual Lilac Festivals, including: * The Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts, which celebrates \\"Lilac Sunday\\" every May. The Arboretum shows off its collection of over 422 lilac plants, of 194 different varieties.Harvard.edu Lilac Sunday is the only day of the year when picnicking is allowed on the grounds of the Arboretum. * Lombard, Illinois, called the \\"Lilac Village\\", which has an annual lilac festival and parade in May. The village also contains Lilacia Park, a garden with over 200 varieties of lilacs, as well as over 50 kinds of tulips. * Mackinac Island, in Michigan, which celebrates a weeklong lilac festival and lilac parade each June. * Rochester, New York, which has held its Lilac Festival since 1898, hosts the longest-running festival in North America. Held in Highland Park, this celebration features 1,200 shrubs, representing over 500 varieties, many of which were developed in Rochester. It is the largest collection of varieties at any single place. * The Royal Botanical Gardens near Hamilton, Ontario, which holds its Lilac Celebration each May. * Spokane, Washington, known as the \\"Lilac City\\", which holds an annual lilac festival and lilac parade. * Franktown, Ontario, Canada, holds an annual festival.

Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly. Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Taxonomy Silene was originally described by Linnaeus. Silene is the feminine form of Silenus, a Greek woodland deity.Quattrocchi, U. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names. 1999. 4: 2482. Divisions of the genus into subgenera or sections before 2003 do not seem to be well-supported by molecular evidence. The genus Lychnis is closely related to and sometimes considered separate from Silene, differing in the flowers having five styles (three in Silene), the seed capsule having five teeth (six in Silene), and in the sticky stems of Lychnis. Common names include campion and catchfly, the latter name based on the sticky stems. Selected species Silene chalcedonica Silene colorata Silene dioica Silene flos-cuculi (ragged robin) Silene flos-jovis Silene gallica var. quinquevulnera Silene sieboldii Silene virginica When the related genera Lychnis, Melandrium, and Viscaria are included in Silene, it contains about 900 species. Species include: Ecology The lychnis is also the common name of Hadena bicruris, a species of noctuid moth. The larva of this moth feeds on Silene (formerly Lychnis) species, as do some other Lepidoptera including cabbage moth (recorded on Silene chalcedonica), grey chi and case-bearers of the genus Coleophora including C. albella (feeds exclusively on Silene flos- cuculi) and C. leucapennella. Uses Many species of Silene are in cultivation for perennial gardens. Some have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, including Silene flos-jovis and Silene schafta. Silene undulata (syn. S. capensis) is known as iindlela zimhlophe (\\"white paths\\") by the Xhosa of South Africa. A Xhosa diviner identifies and collects the plant from the wild. The roots are ground, mixed with water, and beaten to a froth, which is consumed by novice diviners during the full moon to influence their dreams. They also take it to prepare for various rituals. The root has such a strong, musky essence that the diviners who consume it exude the scent in their sweat.Hirst, M. (2005). Dreams and medicines: The perspective of Xhosa diviners and novices in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology 5(2) 1-22. Scientific history Members of this genus have been the subject of research by preeminent plant ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists, including Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel, Carl Correns, Herbert G. Baker, and Janis Antonovics. Many Silene species continue to be widely used to study systems, particularly in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology.Bernasconi et al. 2009. Silene as a model system in ecology and evolution. Heredity. 103:5-14. PMID 19367316 The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. Silene species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or male-sterile) individuals (gynodioecy), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited,Correns C. 1906. Die vererbung der Geshlechstsformen bei den gynodiocischen Pflanzen. Ber. Dtsch Bot. Ges. 24: 459‚Äì474.Correns C. 1908.

Two independent groups of species in Silene have evolved separate male and female sexes (dioecy) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals.Evolution of Sex Chromosomes: The Case of the White Campion. PLoS Biol 3(1): e28. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030028Mrackova M. et al. 2008. Independent origin of sex chromosomes in two species of the genus Silene. 179(2): 1129‚Äì1133. PMID 18558658 Silene flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as Rhingia campestris. Silene species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to heavy-metal-contaminated soils, metapopulation genetics, and organelle genome evolution. Notably, some members of the genus Silene hold the distinction of harboring the largest mitochondrial genomes ever identified.Sloan DB et al. 2012.

Home to a population of over 26,000, Hervanta is best known for its prefabricated blocks of flats. The total number of apartments is about 11,000. Nearly a fifth of the inhabitants (some 4,500 people) are students, many of them enrolled at the Tampere University of Technology (TUT) or the Police College. The largest student housing complex is Mikontalo, in fact nearly 3% of people in Hervanta reside there. Approximately 10% of Hervanta's population is composed of foreigners from 75 different nationalities. Hervanta currently covers an area of 13.8 km¬≤ and is continuing to grow. It was selected as Finland's top suburb in a survey conducted by the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper and published on 17 August 2003. The complex of commercial buildings in the town center of Hervanta was designed by the Finnish architect Reima Pietil√§. Technology Hervanta is sometimes called the Silicon Valley of Finland, because of the high concentration of high tech companies in the area and the presence of the Tampere University of Technology. As well as the University, Hervanta is also home to the Hermia science centre and the VTT office complex. The world's first-ever GSM phone call was made in Hervanta in 1991, when Radiolinja started building its GSM network. Nokia, Huawei, Intel, Microsoft, and many other companies have offices in Hervanta. Hervanta center at night. Community center complex can be seen on the left. Recreation On the north edge of Hervanta at Lukonm√§ki is a downhill skiing centre with two skiing runs and one lift. The ski centre also includes a small ski jump tower that is clearly visible when entering Hervanta from the north along Hervannan valtav√§yl√§ road. On the west side of Hervanta is located lake Suolij√§rvi that has a small beach for sunbathing and swimming. Around the lake goes two trails. The innermost and smaller trail goes around the lake near the shore while the outermost one makes a longer route keeping a fair distance to the lake. The longer route is linked to the trail network stretching around Tampere. The trails are used for jogging and cross-country skiing (during winter). Hervanta has numerous small sport fields that are generally used for soccer and Finnish baseball. During winter some of the fields are frozen for ice-skating and ice hockey. Hervanta also has a kind of a central park called Ahvenispuisto around lake Ahvenisj√§rvi. In southern part of Hervanta there is another big park called N√§yttelij√§npuisto. N√§yttelij√§npuisto has a disc golf track and a noteworthy hill that is used for tobogganing in winter. In addition to the two mentioned parks there are numerous smaller parks.

The ruins of the city can be found in the Sybaris archaeological park near Sibari in the Province of Cosenza, Calabria, Italy. History Excavated area seen from the normal elevation of the surrounding landscape. Excavated remains of buildings, possibly from Thurii. Excavated mosaic floor with swastikas, possibly from Thurii. =Foundation= Thurii was one of the latest of all the Greek colonies in this part of Italy, not having been founded until nearly 70 years after the fall of Sybaris. Justin writes that people say that the city of Thurii was built by Philoctetes and his monument is seen there even to his days, as well as the arrows of Hercules which laid up in the temple of Apollo.Justin, History of the World, 20.1 The site of that city had remained desolate for a period of 58 years after its destruction by the Crotoniats; when at length, in 452 BC, a number of the Sybarite exiles and their descendants made an attempt to establish themselves again on the spot, under the guidance of some leaders of Thessalian origin; and the new colony rose so rapidly to prosperity that it excited the jealousy of the Crotoniats, who, in consequence, expelled the new settlers a little more than 5 years after the establishment of the colony.Diod. xi. 90, xii. 10. The fugitive Sybarites first appealed for support to Sparta, but without success: their application to the Athenians was more successful, and that people determined to send out a fresh colony, at the same time that they reinstated the settlers who had been lately expelled from thence. A body of Athenian colonists was accordingly sent out by Pericles, under the command of Lampon and Xenocritus. Pericles' expressed intent was for it to be a Panhellenic colony, and the number of Athenian citizens was small, the greater part of those who took part in the colony being collected from various parts of Greece. Among them were two celebrated names - Herodotus the historian, and the orator Lysias, both of whom appear to have formed part of the original colony.Diod. xii. 10; Strabo vi. p. 263; Dionys. Lys. p. 453; Vit. X. Orat. p. 835; Plutarch Peric. 11, Nic. 5. The laws of the new colony were established by the sophist Protagoras at the request of Pericles,Barrett, Harold. The Sophists (Novato, California: Chandler & Sharp Publishers, INC, 1987), 10. adopting the laws of Zaleucus of Locri. The new colonists at first established themselves on the site of the deserted Sybaris, but shortly afterwards removed (apparently in obedience to an oracle) to a spot at a short distance from thence, where there was a fountain named \\"Thuria\\", from whence the new city derived its name of Thurii.Diod. l. c.; Strabo l. c. The foundation of Thurii is assigned by Diodorus to the year 446 BC; but other authorities place it three years later, 443 BC, and this seems to be the best authenticated date.H. F. Clinton, Fasti Hellenici. Vol. ii. p. 54. The protection of the Athenian name probably secured the rising colony from the assaults of the Crotoniats, at least we hear nothing of any obstacles to its progress from that quarter; but it was early disturbed by dissensions between the descendants of the original Sybarite settlers and the new colonists, the former laying claim not only to honorary distinctions, but to the exclusive possession of important political privileges. These disputes at length ended in a revolution, and the Sybarites were finally expelled from the city. They established themselves for a short time in Sybaris on the Traeis but did not maintain their footing long, being dislodged and finally dispersed by the neighboring barbarians.Diod. xii. 11, 22; Arist. Pol. v. 3. The Thurians meanwhile concluded a treaty of peace with Crotona, and the new city rose rapidly to prosperity. Fresh colonists poured in from all quarters, especially the Peloponnese; and though it continued to be generally regarded as an Athenian colony, the Athenians in fact formed but a small element of the population. The citizens were divided, as we learn from Diodorus, into ten tribes, the names of which sufficiently indicate their origin. They were: the Arcadian (from Arcadia), Achaean (from Achaea), Elean (from Elea), Boeotian (from Boeotia), Amphictyonic (from Amphictyonis), Dorian (from Doris), Ionian (from Ionia), Athenian (from Athens), Euboean (from Euboea), and Nesiotic (from the islands).Diod. xii. 11. The form of government was democratic, and the city is said to have enjoyed the advantage of a well-ordered system of laws; but the statement of Diodorus, who represents this as owing to the legislation of Charondas, and that lawgiver himself as a citizen of Thurii, is certainly erroneous. The city itself was laid out with great regularity, being divided by four broad streets or plateae, each of which was crossed in like manner by three others.Diod. xii. 10. =War and conflict= Very shortly after its foundation, Thurii became involved in a war with Tarentum (modern Taranto). The subject of this was the possession of the fertile district of the Siritis, about 50 km north of Thurii, to which the Athenians had a claim of long standing, which was naturally taken up by their colonists. The Spartan general, Cleandridas, who had been banished from Greece some years before, and taken up his abode at Thurii, became the general of the Thurians in this war, which, after various successes, was at length terminated by a compromise, both parties agreeing to the foundation of the new colony of Heracleia in the disputed territory.Diod. xii. 23, 36, xiii. 106; Strabo vi. p. 264; Polyaen. Strat. ii. 10. Knowledge of the history of Thurii is very scanty and fragmentary. Fresh disputes arising between the Athenian citizens and the other colonists were at length allayed by the oracle of Delphi, which decided that the city had no other founder than Apollo.Diod. xii. 35. But the same difference appears again on occasion of the great Athenian expedition to Sicily, when the city was divided into two parties, the one desirous of favoring and supporting the Athenians, the other opposed to them. The latter faction at first prevailed, so far that the Thurians observed the same neutrality towards the Athenian fleet under Nicias and Alcibiades as the other cities of Italy.Thucydides vi. 44. Thurii was, in fact, the city where Alcibiades escaped his Athenian captors who were taking him home for trial. But two years afterwards (413 BC) the Athenian party had regained the ascendency; and when Demosthenes and Eurymedon touched at Thurii, the citizens afforded them every assistance, and even furnished an auxiliary force of 700 hoplites and 300 dartmen.Id. vii. 33, 35. From this time we hear nothing of Thurii for a period of more than 20 years, though there is reason to believe that this was just the time of its greatest prosperity. In 390 BC we find that its territory was already beginning to suffer from the incursions of the Lucanians, a new and formidable enemy, for protection against whom all the cities of Magna Graecia had entered into a defensive league. But the Thurians were too impatient to wait for the support of their allies, and issued forth with an army of 14,000 foot and 1000 horse, with which they repulsed the attacks of the Lucanians; but having rashly followed them into their own territory, they were totally defeated, near La√ºs, and above 10,000 of them cut to pieces.Diod. xiv. 101. This defeat must have inflicted a severe blow on the prosperity of Thurii, while the continually increasing power of the Lucanians and Bruttians, in their immediate neighborhood would prevent them from quickly recovering from its effects. The city continued also to be on hostile, or at least unfriendly, terms with Dionysius of Syracuse, and was in consequence chosen as a place of retirement or exile by his brother Leptines and his friend Philistus.Diod. xv. 7. The rise of the Bruttian people about 356 BC probably became the cause of the complete decline of Thurii, but the statement of Diodorus that the city was conquered by that peoplexvi. 15. must be received with considerable doubt. It reappears in history at a later period, when Corinthian soldiers en route to join Timoleon on his expedition to Syracuse are blockaded there by Carthaginian ships. At this point it is still an independent Greek city, though much fallen from its former greatness. No mention of it is found during the wars of Alexander of Epirus in this part of Italy; but at a later period it was so hard pressed by the Lucanians that it had recourse to the alliance of Rome; and a Roman army was sent to its relief under Gaius Fabricius Luscinus. He defeated the Lucanians, who had actually laid siege to the city, in a pitched battle, and by several other successes to a great extent broke their power, and thus relieved the Thurians from all immediate danger from that quarter.Livy Epit. xi.; Pliny xxxiv. 6. s. 15; Valerius Maximus i. 8. ¬ß 6. But shortly after they were attacked on the other side by the Tarentines, who are said to have taken and plundered their city;Appian, Samn. 7. ¬ß 1. and this aggression was one of the immediate causes of the war declared by the Romans against Tarentum in 282 BC. =Roman dependency= Thurii now sunk completely into the condition of a dependent ally of Rome, and was protected by a Roman garrison. No mention is found of its name during the wars with Pyrrhus or the First Punic War, but it plays a considerable part in the Second Punic War with Hannibal. It was apparently one of the cities which revolted to the Carthaginians after the battle of Cannae. In another passage, Livy places its defection more precisely in 212 BC.Liv. xxii. 61, xxv. 1. After the defection of Tarentum, they betrayed the Roman troops into the hands of the Carthaginian general Hanno.Id. xxv. 15; Appian, Hann. 34. A few years later (210 BC), Hannibal, finding himself unable to protect his allies in Campania, removed the inhabitants of Atella who had survived the fall of their city to Thurii;Appian, Hann. 49. but it was not long before he was compelled to abandon the latter city also to its fate. When he himself in 204 BC withdrew his forces into Bruttium, he removed to Crotona 3500 of the principal citizens of Thurii, while he gave up the city itself to the plunder of his troops.Appian, l. c., 57. It is evident that Thurii was now sunk to the lowest state of decay, but the great fertility of its territory rendered it desirable to preserve it from utter desolation. Hence in 194 BC, it was one of the places selected for the establishment of a Roman colony with Latin rights.Liv. xxxiv. 53; Strabo vi. p. 263. The number of colonists was small in proportion to the extent of land to be divided among them, but they amounted to 3000 foot and 300 knights.Liv. xxxv. 9. Livy says merely that the colony was sent in Thurinum agrum, and does not mention anything of a change of name, but Strabo tells us that they gave to the new colony the name of Copiae, and this statement is confirmed both by Stephanus of Byzantium and by the evidence of coins, on which, however, the name is written \\"COPIA\\".Strabo l. c.; Steph. Byz. s. v. ; Eckhel, vol. i. p. 164. But this new name did not continue long in use, and Thurii still continued to be known by its ancient appellation. It is mentioned as a municipal town on several occasions during the latter ages of the Roman Republic. In 72 BC it was taken by Spartacus and subjected to heavy contributions but not otherwise injured.Appian, B.C. i. 117. According to Suetonius, the Octavian family held some renown there, and Gaius Octavius (father of the future Caesar Augustus) defeated a Spartacist army near there. As a result, the future emperor was granted the surname Thurinus shortly after birth. At the outbreak of the Civil Wars, it was deemed by Julius Caesar of sufficient importance to be secured with a garrison of Gaulish and Spanish horse, and it was there that M. Caelius Rufus was put to death, after a vain attempt to excite an insurrection in this part of Italy.Julius Caesar Commentarii de Bello Civili iii. 21, 22. In 40 BC also it was attacked by Sextus Pompeius, who laid waste its territory, but he was repulsed from the walls of the city.Appian, B.C. v. 56, 58. It is certain therefore that Thurii was at this time still a place of some importance, and it is mentioned as a still existing town by Pliny and Ptolemy, as well as Strabo.Strabo vi. p. 263; Plin. iii. 11. s. 15; Ptol. iii. 1. ¬ß 12. It was probably, indeed, the only place of any consideration remaining on the coast of the Tarentine gulf between Crotona and Tarentum; both Metapontum and Heracleia having already fallen into almost complete decay. Its name is still found in the Itineraries,Antonine Itinerary p. 114, where it is written Turios; Tabula Peutingeriana. and it is noticed by Procopius as still existing in the 6th century.Procop. B. G. i. 15. = Abandonment = Over time the sediment accretion of the Crati river caused its river delta to shift towards the sea at a long term rate of one meter a year. As a consequence the successive sites of Sybaris, Thurii, and Copia became landlocked and lost their importance because they no longer had easy access to the sea for trade. The period of its final decay is uncertain; but it seems to have been abandoned during the Middle Ages when the inhabitants took refuge at a place called Terranova (Terranova da Sibari), about 15 kilometers inland, on a hill on the left bank of the Crati. The exact location of Greek Thurii is not known but that of the Roman town, which probably though not certainly occupied the same site, is fixed by several ruins as being about 6 kilometers to the east of Terranova da Sibari and as occupying an area some 6 km in circuit. It is clear from the statements both of Diodorus and Strabo, that Thurii occupied a site near to, but distinct from, that of Sybaris:Diod. xii. 10; Strab. l. c. hence the position suggested by some local topographers at the foot of the hill of Terranova, is probably too far inland. It is more likely that the true site is to be sought to the north of the Coscile (the ancient Sybaris), a few kilometers from the sea, where ruins still exist, attributed to Sybaris, but which are probably in reality those of Thurii. Henry Swinburne, however, mentions Roman ruins as existing in the peninsula formed by the rivers Crathis and Sybaris near their junction, which may perhaps be those of Thurii.Henry Swinburne, Travels, vol. i. pp. 291, 292; Romanelli, vol. i. p. 236. Coinage Thurii had an active mint in antiquity. The coins of Thurii are of great beauty; their number and variety indeed gives us a higher idea of the opulence and prosperity of the city than we should gather from the statements of ancient writers.

The study, collection and repair of flip clocks is termed horopalettology [From horology - The study and measurement of time and palette - from the Italian \\"orologio a palette\\" - Italian for \\"flip clock\\"]. People interested in the collection, restoration, buying and selling of flip clocks are known as horopalettologists. Method of operation An electric motor (often synchronous, if directly connected to the AC line) turns two sets of wheels continuously via a reduction gear train: the faster at a rate of 1 revolution per hour, the slower at a rate of 1 revolution per 24 hours. The wheels move continuously, not in steps. Mechanism of a split-flap alarm clock, removed from its case. The inset shows the metal tab holding back the top flap. The narrow numbered wheel and knobs on the left are the alarm mechanism. Unlike quartz clocks, this is a synchronous electric clock which is kept to the correct time by the 50/60 Hz AC power grid. The small hook which retains the hour leaves until the top of the hour can be dimly seen, retracted, in the inset. The faster wheel has connected to it a ring of 60 flat plastic leaves. On the leaves are printed numerals so that, when a person holds two adjacent leaves apart like an open book, the two open leaves spell out a numeral, and flipping a leaf down increases the number shown by 1 unit. The \\"book\\" is opened vertically, and its pages form a ring. This ring is put into position and rotated so that one page falls each minute, showing a new number for the minutes. The slower wheel has connected to it a similar ring of leaves, only there are 48 leaves on this ring. These leaves have hour numbers printed on them. There are two of each hour, like this: 12am, 12am, 1am, 1am, 2am, 2am, ... 11pm, 11pm in a 12-hour clock, and 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, ... 23, 23 in a 24-hour clock. Having two sets of leaves for each hour also allows the clock to alternate between 12- and 24-hour display, every half hour, like this: 12am, 0h, 1am, 1h, 2am, 2h, ... 11pm, 23h. One leaf falls each half-hour, at approximately 25 and 55 minutes after the hour. A different design features 60 leaves with the numbers 1 to 12 repeated in fives, each leaf falling after 12 minutes. The disadvantage of this is that 24-hour clocks cannot use this design, nor there is a way to show \\"AM\\" or \\"PM\\" information in a 12-hour design. Minute leaves 45 through 59 have a small tooth on their left edges, pointing toward the hour leaves. The purpose of this tooth is as follows: at 45 minutes after the hour, the tooth pushes a small hook that protrudes into the hour wheel area. This hook will catch any falling hour leaf (as mentioned above, it falls from its metal tab a few minutes before the hour) until it is released by the minute leaf's fall at the top of the hour.  Daylight saving time  A 1969 radio alarm clock (Sony Digimatic 8FC-59W) with an early digital display Many vintage digital clocks with split flap displays cannot be wound back, as the flip mechanism operates only in one direction. Instead they must be either wound forward 23 hours to achieve the effect of winding back 1 hour at the end of daylight saving time or the clock may be stopped (by disconnecting it from power) for 1 hour. However, on some newer clocks, forward and backward time setting is possible. GE clocks sometimes had this feature.

Casper is the second largest city in the state, according to the 2020 U.S. Census, with a population of 55,293. Only Cheyenne, the state capital, is larger. Casper is nicknamed \\"The Oil City\\" and has a long history of oil boomtown and cowboy culture, dating back to the development of the nearby Salt Creek Oil Field. In 2010, Casper was named the highest-ranked family-friendly small city in the West, and ranked eighth overall in the nation in Forbes magazine's list of \\"the best small cities to raise a family\\". Casper is located in east-central Wyoming at the foot of Casper Mountain, the north end of the Laramie Mountain Range, and along the North Platte River. History The city was established east of the former site of Fort Caspar, which was built during the mid-19th century mass migration of land seekers along the Oregon, California and Mormon trails. The area was the location of several ferries that offered passage across the North Platte River in the early 1840s. In 1859, Louis Guinard built a bridge and trading post near the original ferry locations. Buildings at Fort Caspar The government soon posted a military garrison nearby to protect telegraph and mail service. It was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William O. Collins. American Indian attacks increased after the Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado in 1864, bringing more troops to the post, which was by now called Platte Bridge Station. In July 1865, Lieutenant Caspar Collins (the son of Colonel Collins) was killed near the post by a group of Indian warriors. Three months later the garrison was renamed Fort Caspar after Lieutenant Collins. In 1867, the troops were ordered to abandon Fort Caspar in favor of Fort Fetterman downstream on the North Platte along the Bozeman Trail. The town of Casper itself was founded well after the fort had been closed. The city was founded by developers as an anticipated stopping point during the expansion of the Wyoming Central Railway; it was an early commercial rival to Bessemer and Douglas, Wyoming. The lack of a railhead doomed Bessemer in favor of Casper. Douglas, also a railhead, survives to the present day. The presence of a railhead made Casper the starting off point for the \\"invaders\\" in the Johnson County War. The special chartered train carrying the men up from Texas stopped at Casper. The town is named \\"Casper\\", instead of \\"Caspar\\", honoring the memory of Fort Caspar and Lt. Caspar Collins, due to a typo that occurred when the town's name was officially registered. A site a few miles east was planned to be the original site of Casper, where a homesteader named Joshua Stroud lived prior to a station of the Chicago and North Western Railway being built. The site was laid out by the Pioneer Town Site Company in 1888 and was known as Strouds. The city received a significant number of visitors during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, due to its position along the path of totality. Geography and climate The waterfall at Casper's Rotary Park, at the base of Casper Mountain Interstate 25, which approaches Casper from the north and east, is the main avenue of transportation to and from the city. The towns immediately adjacent to Casper are Mills, Evansville, and Bar Nunn. Unincorporated areas include Allendale, Dempsey Acres, Red Buttes, Indian Springs, and several others.

Economy Casper is a regional center of banking and commerce. Sinclair's Casper refinery in nearby Evansville After the discovery of crude oil in the region during the 1890s, Casper became the regional petroleum industry center. Oil has figured prominently in its history from nearly the outset. Oil was first discovered in the famous Salt Creek Oil Field in 1889, approximately north of Casper; the first refinery in Casper was built in 1895. The city has featured a refinery ever since, although various refineries have been built and closed over the years. As recently as the early 1980s, the city was near or home to three refineries. The surviving one, operated by Sinclair Oil Corporation, is located nearby in Evansville. Development of Wyoming coal and uranium fields in recent decades has helped Casper continue its role as a center in the energy industry. Casper Wind Farm began operations near Capser in Natrona County and has 11 turbines with a generating capacity of 16.5 MW.\\"Rocky Mountain Power's Wind Projects.\\" Rocky Mountain Power. 2010. PDF .

By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably Korea, China, and Japan. Most are shrubs 1 to 3 meters tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to by climbing up trees. They can be either deciduous or evergreen, though the widely cultivated temperate species are all deciduous. Hydrangea is derived from Greek and means ‚Äòwater vessel‚Äô, in reference to the shape of its seed capsules.Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). pp 50, 206 The earlier name, Hortensia, is a Latinised version of the French given name Hortense, referring to the wife of Jean-Andr√© Lepaute. Life cycle Hydrangea flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn; they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles) most often at the ends of the stems. Typically the flowerheads contain two types of flowers: small non-showy flowers in the center or interior of the flowerhead, and large, showy flowers with large colorful sepals (tepals). These showy flowers are often extended in a ring, or to the exterior of the small flowers. Plants in wild populations typically have few to none of the showy flowers, while cultivated hydrangeas have been bred and selected to have more of the larger type flowers. There are two flower arrangements in hydrangeas with corymb style inflorescences, which includes the commonly grown \\"bigleaf hydrangea\\"‚ÄîHydrangea macrophylla. Mophead flowers are large round flowerheads resembling pom-poms or, as the name implies, the head of a mop. In contrast, lacecap flowers bear round, flat flowerheads with a center core of subdued, small flowers surrounded by outer rings of larger flowers having showy sepals or tepals. The flowers of some rhododendrons and viburnums can appear, at first glance, similar to those of some hydrangeas. Hydrangea flowers, when cut, dehydrate easily and wilt very fast due to the large surface area of the petals. A wilted hydrangea may have its hydration restored by first having its stem immersed in boiling water; as the petals of the hydrangea can also absorb water, the petals may then be immersed, in room-temperature water, to restore the flower's hydration. Colours and soil acidity Hydrangea flower color changes based on the pH in soil. As the graph depicts, soil with a pH of 5.5 or lower will sprout blue hydrangeas, a ph of 6.5 or higher will produce pink hydrangeas, and soil in between 5.5 and 6.5 will have purple hydrangeas. White hydrangeas can not be manipulated by soil pH, they will always be white because they do not contain pigment for color. In most species the flowers are white, but in some species (notably H. macrophylla), can be blue, red, pink, light purple, or dark purple. In these species, floral color change occurs due to the presence of aluminium ions which are available or tied up depending upon the soil pH. For H. macrophylla and H. serrata cultivars, the flower color can be determined by the relative acidity of the soil: an acidic soil (pH below 7), will have available aluminium ions and typically produce flowers that are blue to purple,. whereas an alkaline soil (pH above 7) will tie up aluminium ions and result in pink or red flowers. This is caused by a color change of the flower pigments in the presence of aluminium ions which can be taken up into hyperaccumulating plants. Lowering the pH of potting soils or mixes usually does not change the flower color to blue, because these soils have no aluminium ions. The ability to blue or pink a hydrangea is also influenced by the cultivar. Some plants are selected for their ability to be blued, while others are bred and selected to be red, pink or white. The flower color of most other Hydrangea species is not affected by aluminium and cannot be changed or shifted. Hydrangeas are also nicknamed 'Change Rose'.

Fossil record Hydrangea alaskana is a fossil species recovered from paleogene strata in Jaw Mountain Alaska. Four fossil seeds of Hydrangea polonica have been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.≈Åa≈Ñcucka-≈örodoniowa M.: Macroscopic plant remains from the freshwater Miocene of the Nowy SƒÖcz Basin (West Carpathians, Poland) [SzczƒÖtki makroskopowe ro≈õlin z miocenu s≈Çodkowodnego Kotliny SƒÖdeckiej (Karpaty Zachodnie, Polska)]. Acta Palaeobotanica 1979 20 (1): 3-117. Cultivation and uses Hydrangeas are popular ornamental plants, grown for their large flowerheads, with Hydrangea macrophylla being by far the most widely grown with over 600 named cultivars, many selected to have only large sterile flowers in the flowerheads. Hydrangea macrophylla, also known as Bigleaf Hydrangea, can be broken up into two main categories; Mophead Hydrangea & Lacecap Hydrangea. Some are best pruned on an annual basis when the new leaf buds begin to appear. If not pruned regularly, the bush will become very 'leggy', growing upwards until the weight of the stems is greater than their strength, at which point the stems will sag down to the ground and possibly break. Other species only flower on 'old wood'. Thus new wood resulting from pruning will not produce flowers until the following season. Hydrangea root and rhizome are indicated for treatment of conditions of the urinary tract in the PDR for Herbal Medicine and may have diuretic properties.PDR for Herbal Medicine 3rd Edition Page 453 Hydrangeas are moderately toxic if eaten, with all parts of the plant containing cyanogenic glycosides. Hydrangea paniculata is reportedly sometimes smoked as an intoxicant, despite the danger of illness and/or death due to the cyanide. The flowers on a hydrangea shrub can change from blue to pink or from pink to blue from one season to the next depending on the acidity level of the soil. Adding organic materials such as coffee grounds, citrus peel or eggshells will increase acidity and turn hydrangea flowers blue, as described in an article on Gardenista. A popular pink hydrangea called Vanilla Strawberry has been named \\"Top Plant\\" by the American Nursery and Landscape Association. The hybrid \\"Runaway Bride Snow White\\", bred by Ushio Sakazaki from Japan, was named Plant of the Year at the 2018 RHS Chelsea Flower Show. =In culture= In Japan, ama-cha,ÁîòËå∂ meaning sweet tea, is another herbal tea made from Hydrangea serrata, whose leaves contain a substance that develops a sweet taste (phyllodulcin). For the fullest taste, fresh leaves are crumpled, steamed, and dried, yielding dark brown tea leaves. Ama-cha is mainly used for kan-butsu-e (the Buddha bathing ceremony) on April 8 every year‚Äîthe day thought to be Buddha's birthday in Japan. During the ceremony, Ama-cha is poured over a statue of Buddha and served to people in attendance. A legend has it that on the day Buddha was born, nine dragons poured Amrita over him; ama-cha is substituted for Amrita in Japan. In Korean tea, Hydrangea serrata (hangul:ÏÇ∞ÏàòÍµ≠ hanja:) is used for an herbal tea called sugukcha (ÏàòÍµ≠Ï∞®) or isulcha (Ïù¥Ïä¨Ï∞®). The pink hydrangea has risen in popularity all over the world, especially in Asia. The given meaning of pink hydrangeas is popularly tied to the phrase, \\"You are the beat of my heart,\\" as described by the celebrated Asian florist Tan Jun Yong, where he was quoted saying, \\"The light delicate blush of the petals reminds me of a beating heart, while the size could only match the heart of the sender!\\" Hydrangea quercifolia was declared the official state wildflower of Alabama in 1999.State Botanical SymbolsBy Alan McPherson, p.3 Gallery File:Hortensiapink.JPGHydrangea macrophylla File:Hydrangea close up.jpgHydrangea flowers close up.

Some of these hybrids are referred to as Viola √ó wittrockiana Gams ex Nauenb. & Buttler. For simplicity, the older name Viola tricolor var. hortensis is often used. The garden pansy flower is in diameter and has two slightly overlapping upper petals, two side petals, and a single bottom petal with a slight beard emanating from the flower's center. These petals are usually white or yellow, purplish, or blue. The plant may grow to in height, and prefers sun to varying degrees and well-draining soils.  Names and terminology  Pansy displaying the two upper overlapping petals, the two side petals, and the single bottom petal Pansies growing at the edge of the pavement English common names, such as \\"pansy\\", \\"viola\\" and \\"violet\\" may be used interchangeably. One possible distinction is that plants considered to be \\"pansies\\" are classified in Viola sect. Melanium, and have four petals pointing upwards (the two side petals point upwards), and only one pointing down, whereas those considered to be \\"violets\\" are classified in Viola sect. Viola, and have two petals pointing up and three pointing down. Another possible distinction is made by the American Violet Society ‚Äì the International Cultivar Registration Authority for the genus Viola. It divides cultivated varieties (cultivars) in Viola sect. Melanium into four subgroups: B1 ‚Äì pansies, B2 ‚Äì violas, B3 ‚Äì violettas and B4 ‚Äì cornuta hybrids. On this classification, modern \\"pansies\\" differ from the other three subgroups by possessing a well-defined \\"blotch\\" or \\"eye\\" in the middle of the flower. Modern horticulturalists tend to use the term \\"pansy\\" for those multi-coloured large-flowered hybrids that are grown for bedding purposes every year, while \\"viola\\" is usually reserved for smaller, more delicate annuals and perennials. = Etymology = The name \\"pansy\\" is derived from the French word pens√©e, \\"thought\\", and was imported into Late Middle English as a name of Viola in the mid-15th century, as the flower was regarded as a symbol of remembrance. The name \\"love in idleness\\" was meant to imply the image of a lover who has little or no other employment than to think of his beloved. The name \\"heart's-ease\\" came from St. Euphrasia, whose name in Greek signifies cheerfulness of mind. The woman, who refused marriage and took the veil, was considered a pattern of humility, hence the name \\"humble violet\\".McGlashan, James. The Dublin University Magazine: A Literary and Political Journal. Vol. 42. July to December 1853: 286. In Scandinavia,Botanical info on Viola tricolor in Sweden Scotland, and German- speaking countries, the pansy (or its wild parent Viola tricolor) is or was known as the \\"stepmother\\"; the name was accompanied by an aitiological tale about a selfish stepmother, told to children while the teller plucked off corresponding parts of the blossom to fit the plot.Silverthorne, Elizabeth. Legends and Lore of Texas Wildflowers. Texas A&M; University Press, 2003. In Italy the pansy is known as flammola (little flame).  Historical background  Viola tricolor flower close up A bicolor pansy In the early years of the 19th century, Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet (1785‚Äì1861), daughter of the Earl of Tankerville, collected and cultivated every sort of Viola tricolor (commonly, heartsease) she could procure in her father's garden at Walton-upon-Thames, Surrey. Under the supervision of her gardener, William Richardson, a large variety of plants was produced via cross-breeding. In 1812, she introduced her pansies to the horticultural world, and, in 1813, Mr. Lee, a well-known florist and nurseryman, further cultivated the flower. Other nurserymen followed Lee's example, and the pansy became a favorite among the public. About the same time that Lady Bennett was busy cultivating heartsease, James, Lord Gambier was doing the same in his garden at Iver under the advice and guidance of his gardener William Thompson. A yellow viola, Viola lutea, and a wide-petalled pale yellow species of Russian origin, Viola altaica were among the crosses that laid the foundation for the new hybrids classed as Viola √ó wittrockiana, named for the Swedish botanist Veit Brecher Wittrock (1839‚Äì1914). A round flower of overlapping petals was the aim of some early experimenters; in the late 1830s a chance sport that no longer had narrow nectar guides of dark color on the petals but a broad dark blotch on the petals (which came to be called the \\"face\\"), was found. It was developed in Gambier's garden and released to the public in 1839 with the name \\"Medora\\". By 1833, there were 400 named pansies available to gardeners who once considered its progenitor, heartsease, a weed. Specific guidelines were formulated for show pansies but amateur gardeners preferred the less demanding fancy pansies. About this time, James Grieve developed the viola and Dr. Charles Stuart developed the violetta, both smaller, more compact plants than the pansy.Johnson, Sophia Orne. Every woman her own flower gardener: A manual of flower gardening for ladies. 7th ed. Pg 38‚Äì39. Ladies Floral Cabinet Co., 1885.Farrar, Elizabeth. 2000. On the Subject of Pansies, Violas, and Violettas. The American Violet Society.Pansy. Windy Acres, Inc.The Country gentleman's magazine. Volume 7. 1871. Pg. 111‚Äì112  Cultivation  Modern horticulturists have developed a wide range of pansy flower colors and bicolors including yellow, gold, orange, purple, violet, red, white, and even near-black (very dark purple). Pansies typically display large showy face markings. The Joker Series has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Pansies produced for the bedding market Plants grow well in sunny or partially sunny positions in well-draining soils. Pansies are perennial, but normally grown as biennials or annuals because of their leggy growth. The first year plant produces greenery, and bears flowers and seeds in its second year of growth. Afterwards, the plant dies like an annual. Because of selective human breeding, most garden pansies bloom the first year, some in as little as nine weeks after sowing. After flowering, a seed capsule matures, eventually opening as seen here. Pansies are purchased as six-packs or \\"flats\\" (USA) of young plants from garden centers and planted directly into the garden soil. Plants will grow up to in height with flowers measuring in diameter, though smaller and larger flowering cultivars are available. Pansies for sale in a British garden centre Pansies are winter hardy in zones 4‚Äì8. They can survive light freezes and short periods of snow cover, but, in areas with prolonged snow cover, a covering of a dry winter mulch is recommended. In warmer climates, zones 9-11, pansies can bloom over the winter, and are often planted in the fall. In warmer zones, pansies may re-seed themselves and return the next year. They are not very heat-tolerant; warm temperatures inhibit blooming and hot muggy air causes rot and death. In colder zones, pansies may not survive without snow cover or protection (mulch) from extreme cold or periods of freezing and thawing. They perform best in zones with moderate temperatures, and equal amounts of mild rainfall and sunshine. Pansies, for best growth, are watered thoroughly about once a week, depending on climate and rainfall. The plant should never be over-watered. To maximize blooming, plant foods are used about every other week, depending on the type of food used. Regular deadheading can extend the blooming period.  Pests and diseases  Aphid and her young = Aphids = Aphids, which can spread the cucumber mosaic virus, sometimes feed on pansies. = Leaf spot = Leaf spot (Ramularia deflectens) is a fungal infection. Symptoms include dark spots on leaf margins followed by a white web covering the leaves. It is associated with cool damp springs. = Downy mildew = Pansy downy mildew is caused by the fungus-like organism Peronospora violae, which produces purple-brown leaf spots, often with encircling yellowing, that have an accompanying grey mold on the leaf underside. It can severely weaken or kill affected plants. = Powdery mildew = A disease caused by one or more species of fungus in the Erysiphaceae family. Symptoms include violet-gray powder on fringes and underside of leaves. It is encouraged by stagnant air and can be limited but not necessarily eliminated by fungicide application. A pansy exhibiting the flower's morphology: two large petals overlapping at the top, two side petals, a lower petal with slight indentation, and beards at the center = Slugs and snails = Slugs and snails feed on the foliage. = Stem rot = Stem rot, also known as pansy sickness, is a soil-borne fungus and a possible hazard with unsterilized animal manure. The plant may collapse without warning in the middle of the season. The foliage will flag and lose color. Flowers will fade and shrivel prematurely. Stem will snap at the soil line if tugged slightly. The plant is probably a total loss unless tufted. The treatment of stem rot includes the use of fungicides such as Cheshunt or Benomyl, which are used prior to planting. Infected plants are destroyed (burned) to prevent the spread of the pathogen to other plants. = Cucumber mosaic virus = The cucumber mosaic virus is transmitted by aphids. Pansies with the virus have fine yellow veining on young leaves, stunted growth and anomalous flowers. The virus can lay dormant, affect the entire plant and be passed to next generations and to other species. Prevention is key: purchases should consist entirely of healthy plants.  In the arts and culture  = Symbolism = Bookbinding embroidered by Elizabeth I in 1544 for her stepmother Katherine Parr with heartsease depicted in each corner The pansy's connection to pious humility is mentioned by Harte, who writes: \\"From brute beasts humility I learned;/And in the pansy‚Äôs life God‚Äôs providence discerned\\". Gifford evokes both Christian and classical undertones, writing how \\"Pansies ‚Äì still,/More blest than me, thus shall ye live/Your little day, ‚Äì and when ye die,/Sweet flowers! The grateful muse/Shall give a verse\\". Smart proposes \\"Were it not for thee, oh sun,/Those pansies, that reclining from the bank/View through the immaculate, pellucid stream,/Their portraiture in the inverted Heaven,/Might as well change their triple boast, the white,/The purple, and the gold\\". On account of its popularity in both society and its recurring appearances in Romantic poetry, a variety of new nicknames for the flower began to circulate. Dorothea Lynde Dix proclaims that ‚ÄúPerhaps no flower (not excepting even the queenly rose) claims to be so universal a favorite, as the viola tricolor; none currently has been honored with so rich a variety of names, at once expressive of grace, delicacy and tenderness.‚ÄùDix, Dorothea Lynde. The garland of flora. S. G. Goodrich and co. and Carter and Hendee, 1829. Many of these names play on the whimsical nature of love, including ‚ÄúThree Faces under a Hood,‚Äù ‚ÄúFlame Flower,‚Äù ‚ÄúJump Up and Kiss Me,‚Äù ‚ÄúFlower of Jove,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPink of my John.‚ÄùPhillips, Henry. Flora Historica: or the Three Seasons of The British Parterre. Vol. 1. London: E. Lloyd and Son, 1824. In Hamlet, Ophelia distributes flowers with the remark, \\"There's pansies, that's for thoughts\\" (IV.5). Other poets referencing the pansy include Ben Jonson, Bernard Barton, Michael Drayton, Edmund Spenser, William Wakefield, and William Wordsworth. \\"Pens√©e\\" from Fleurs Anim√©es by J. J. Grandville (1803‚Äì1847) Nathaniel Hawthorne published his last literary effort, an unfinished piece, entitled Pansie, a Fragment, sometimes called Little Pansie, a fragment in 1864. D. H. Lawrence's Pansies: Poems by D. H. Lawrence was published in 1929, and Margaret Mitchell originally chose Pansy as the name of her Gone with the Wind heroine, but settled on Scarlett just before the book went into print. The word \\"pansy\\" has indicated an effeminate male since Elizabethan times and its usage as a disparaging term for a man or boy who is effeminate, as well as for an avowedly homosexual man, is still used. The word \\"ponce\\" (which has now come to mean a pimp) and the adjective \\"poncey\\" (effeminate) also derive from \\"pansy\\". = Visual arts = In the visual arts, Pierre-Joseph Redout√© painted Bouquet of Pansies in 1827, and, in 1874, Henri Fantin-Latour painted Still Life with Pansies. In 1887, van Gogh painted Mand met viooltjes, and, in 1926, Georgia O'Keeffe created a painting of a black pansy called simply, Pansy and followed it with White Pansy in 1927. J. J. Grandville created a fantasy flower called Pens√©e in his Fleurs Anim√©es. = As an emblem = Mand met viooltjes (Vincent van Gogh, 1887) Because its name means \\"thought\\", the pansy was chosen as a symbol of Freethought and has been used in the literature of the American Secular Union. Humanists use it too, as the pansy's current appearance was developed from the heartsease by two centuries of intentional crossbreeding of wild plant hybrids. The specific colors of the flower ‚Äì purple, yellow, and white ‚Äì are meant to symbolize memories, loving thoughts and souvenirs, respectively. The Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) uses the pansy symbol extensively in its lapel pins and literature. The flower has long been associated with human manner, as one man cleverly stated: ‚ÄúNature sports as much with the colours of this little flower as she does with the features of the human countenance.‚Äù = Traditions and uses = Greeting Card, c. 1900 In William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, the \\"juice of the heartsease\\" is a love potion and \\"on sleeping eyelids laid, will make a man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees.\\" (II.1). In the language of flowers, a honeyflower and a pansy left by a lover for his beloved means, \\"I am thinking of our forbidden love\\". In 1858, the writer James Shirley Hibberd wrote that the French custom of giving a bride a bouquet of pansies (thoughts) and marigolds (cares) symbolized the woes of domestic life rather than marital bliss.Hibberd, James Shirley. The fuchsia, pansy and phlox: their history, properties, cultivation, propaganda, and general management in all seasons. Groombridge and Sons, 1858. A German fable tells of how the pansy lost its perfume. Originally pansies would have been very fragrant, growing wild in fields and forests. It was said that people would trample the grass completely in eagerness to pick pansies. Unfortunately, the people‚Äôs cows were starving due to the ruined fields, so the pansy prayed to give up her perfume. Her prayer was answered, and without her perfumed scent, the fields grew tall, and the cows grew fat on the fresh green grass. American pioneers thought that ‚Äúa handful of violets taken into the farmhouse in the spring ensured prosperity, and to neglect this ceremony brought harm to baby chicks and ducklings.‚Äù On account of its place in American hearts, a game called ‚ÄúViolet War‚Äù also arose. In this game, two players would intertwine the hooks where the pansy blossoms meet the stems, then attempt to pull the two flowers apart like wishbones. Whoever pulled off the most of their opponent‚Äôs violet heads was proclaimed the winner. Young American settlers also made pansy dolls by lining up the pansy flower ‚Äúfaces‚Äù, pasting on leaf skirts and twig arms to complete the figures. The pansy is also used in phytotherapy.Lewis, W.

Early life  Choi was born on 9 November 1918 in Hwa Dae, My≈èngch'≈èn county, in what is now North Korea, which was then under Japanese rule.Park, S. H. (1993): About the author. In H. H. Choi: Taekwon-Do: The Korean art of self-defence, 3rd ed. (Vol. 1, pp. 241‚Äì274). Mississauga: International Taekwon-Do Federation. At the time, the place was named Meigawa-gun (Myongchon-kun), Kankyo-hokudo (Hamgyong-Pukto), Chosen, as part of the Empire of Japan. Choi's father sent him to study calligraphy under Han Il Dong, who was also \\"a master of Taekkyeon, the ancient Korean art of foot fighting\\" (Park, 1993, p. 241). Choi travelled to Japan, where he studied English, mathematics, and karate.Goldman, A. L. (2002): Choi Hong Hi, 83, Korean general who created Tae Kwon Do, The New York Times (29 June 2002). Retrieved on 26 December 2007. In Kyoto, he met a fellow Korean with the surname Kim, who was a karate instructor and taught Choi this martial art. Choi also learned Shotokan karate under Funakoshi Gichin. Just before he had left Korea, Choi apparently had a disagreement with a wrestler named Hu, and the possibility of a future confrontation inspired him to train; in his own words, \\"I would imagine that these were the techniques I would use to defend myself against the wrestler, Mr. Hu, if he did attempt to carry out his promise to tear me limb from limb when I eventually returned to Korea\\" (Park, 1993, p. 242). Choi attained the rank of 1st dan in karate in 1939, and then 2nd dan soon after.  Military career  Choi had been forced to serve in the Japanese army during World War II, but was implicated in a rebellion and imprisoned, during which time he continued practicing martial arts. Following the war, in January 1946, Choi was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Korean army. From 1946 to 1951, Choi received promotions to first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and then brigadier general. Choi was promoted to major general in 1954.  Taekwondo  Choi combined elements of Taekkyon and Oh Do Kwan Karate to develop a style of the martial art known as \\"Taekwondo\\", his organization spelt it Taekwon-Do, (ÌÉúÍ∂åÎèÑ; Ë∑ÜÊã≥ÈÅì), which means \\"foot, fist, art\\" or \\"the way of hand and foot\\" and it was so named on 11 April 1955.Kim, S. J. (2007): History of Taekwondo Retrieved on 18 September 2007. Choi founded the Oh Do Kwan, and held an honorary 4th dan ranking in the Chung Do Kwan. Due to accusations of dishonesty, Choi was stripped of his rank and position in the Chung Do Kwan. During the 1960s, Choi and Nam Tae Hi led the original masters of taekwondo in promoting their martial art around the world, though these would be only the first of many such endeavors. ITF taekwondo organizations credits Choi with starting the spread of taekwondo internationally by stationing Korean taekwondo instructors around the world, and have consistently claimed that ITF-style taekwondo is the only authentic style of taekwondo, most notably in early sections of its textbooks.Franks, A.

In 1972, Choi went into exile in Canada after the South Korean government objected to his introduction of the sport into North Korea, and the South Korea government formed the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) in 1973 (renamed to WT in 2018). In 1979 he traveled to North Korea where he was welcomed by the government and supported in his project of spreading Taekwondo to the world.The Difficult Dialogue: Communism, Nationalism, and Political Propaganda in North Korean Sport, Jung Woo Lee and Alan Bairner, Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 2009, 33: 390 He was remembered as the founder and champion of taekwondo.  Death  Choi died of cancer on 15 June 2002 in Pyongyang, North Korea, where he received a state funeral in the Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery. On his funeral committee were: * Choe Thae-bok * Kim Jung-rin * Kim Yong-sun * Kim Yong-dae * Ryu Mi-yong * Ryom Sun-gil * Kim Kyong-ho * Sung Sang-sop * Pak Sun-hui * An Kyong-ho * Kang Ryon-hak * Chang Ung * Hwang Pong-yong * Kim Yu-ho Choi is listed in the Taekwondo Hall of Fame with various titles: \\"Father of Taekwon- Do,\\" \\"Founder and First President of the International Taekwon-Do Federation,\\" and \\"Founder of Oh Do Kwan.\\"Taekwondo Hall of Fame Retrieved on 12 January 2008.

The spelling of \\"taekwondo\\" varies widely in English usage. The WTF and affiliated organizations typically use \\"taekwondo,\\" while the ITF and affiliated organizations typically use \\"taekwon-do\\" (as Choi used this spelling). In Wikipedia, the default spelling is \\"taekwondo.\\" This article follows this standard, but uses \\"taekwon-do\\" when referring specifically to the ITF or affiliated organizations' names. b. In Park's (1993) article, the note on Choi's promotion to 2nd dan in karate is followed by a note about the outbreak of World War II, which would suggest that Choi's 2nd dan promotion occurred no later than the early stages of that conflict (c. 1939‚Äì1940).

It expresses that a propositional function can be satisfied by every member of a domain of discourse. In other words, it is the predication of a property or relation to every member of the domain. It asserts that a predicate within the scope of a universal quantifier is true of every value of a predicate variable. It is usually denoted by the turned A (‚àÄ) logical operator symbol, which, when used together with a predicate variable, is called a universal quantifier (\\"‚àÄx\\", \\"‚àÄ(x)\\", or sometimes by alone). Universal quantification is distinct from existential quantification (\\"there exists\\"), which only asserts that the property or relation holds for at least one member of the domain. Quantification in general is covered in the article on quantification (logic). Symbols are encoded .  Basics  Suppose it is given that > 2¬∑0 = 0 + 0, and 2¬∑1 = 1 + 1, and 2¬∑2 = 2 + 2, etc. This would seem to be a logical conjunction because of the repeated use of \\"and\\". However, the \\"etc.\\" cannot be interpreted as a conjunction in formal logic. Instead, the statement must be rephrased: > For all natural numbers n, 2¬∑n = n + n. This is a single statement using universal quantification. This statement can be said to be more precise than the original one. While the \\"etc.\\" informally includes natural numbers, and nothing more, this was not rigorously given. In the universal quantification, on the other hand, the natural numbers are mentioned explicitly. This particular example is true, because any natural number could be substituted for n and the statement \\"2¬∑n = n + n\\" would be true. In contrast, > For all natural numbers n, 2¬∑n > 2 + n is false, because if n is substituted with, for instance, 1, the statement \\"2¬∑1 > 2 + 1\\" is false. It is immaterial that \\"2¬∑n > 2 + n\\" is true for most natural numbers n: even the existence of a single counterexample is enough to prove the universal quantification false. On the other hand, for all composite numbers n, 2¬∑n > 2 + n is true, because none of the counterexamples are composite numbers. This indicates the importance of the domain of discourse, which specifies which values n can take.Further information on using domains of discourse with quantified statements can be found in the Quantification (logic) article. In particular, note that if the domain of discourse is restricted to consist only of those objects that satisfy a certain predicate, then for universal quantification this requires a logical conditional. For example, > For all composite numbers n, 2¬∑n > 2 + n is logically equivalent to > For all natural numbers n, if n is composite, then 2¬∑n > 2 + n. Here the \\"if ... then\\" construction indicates the logical conditional. = Notation = In symbolic logic, the universal quantifier symbol \\\\forall (a turned \\"A\\" in a sans-serif font, Unicode U+2200) is used to indicate universal quantification. It was first used in this way by Gerhard Gentzen in 1935, by analogy with Giuseppe Peano's \\\\exists (turned E) notation for existential quantification and the later use of Peano's notation by Bertrand Russell. For example, if P(n) is the predicate \\"2¬∑n > 2 + n\\" and N is the set of natural numbers, then: : \\\\forall n\\\\\\\\!\\\\in\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\; P(n) is the (false) statement: > For all natural numbers n, 2¬∑n > 2 + n. Similarly, if Q(n) is the predicate \\"n is composite\\", then : \\\\forall n\\\\\\\\!\\\\in\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\; \\\\bigl( Q(n) \\\\rightarrow P(n) \\\\bigr) is the (true) statement: > For all natural numbers n, if n is composite, then 2¬∑n > 2 + n and since \\"n is composite\\" implies that n must already be a natural number, we can shorten this statement to the equivalent: : \\\\forall n\\\\; \\\\bigl( Q(n) \\\\rightarrow P(n) \\\\bigr) > For all composite numbers n, 2¬∑n > 2 + n. Several variations in the notation for quantification (which apply to all forms) can be found in the quantification article. There is a special notation used only for universal quantification, which is given: : (n{\\\\in}\\\\mathbb{N})\\\\, P(n) The parentheses indicate universal quantification by default.  Properties  = Negation = Note that a quantified propositional function is a statement; thus, like statements, quantified functions can be negated. The notation most mathematicians and logicians utilize to denote negation is: \\\\lnot\\\\ . However, some use the tilde (~). For example, if P(x) is the propositional function \\"x is married\\", then, for a universe of discourse X of all living human beings, the universal quantification > Given any living person x, that person is married is given: :\\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, P(x) It can be seen that this is irrevocably false. Truthfully, it is stated that > It is not the case that, given any living person x, that person is married or, symbolically: :\\\\lnot\\\\ \\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, P(x). If the statement is not true for every element of the Universe of Discourse, then, presuming the universe of discourse is non-empty, there must be at least one element for which the statement is false. That is, the negation of \\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, P(x) is logically equivalent to \\"There exists a living person x who is not married\\", or: :\\\\exists{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, \\\\lnot P(x) Generally, then, the negation of a propositional function's universal quantification is an existential quantification of that propositional function's negation; symbolically, :\\\\lnot\\\\ \\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, P(x) \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, \\\\lnot P(x) It is erroneous to state \\"all persons are not married\\" (i.e. \\"there exists no person who is married\\") when it is meant that \\"not all persons are married\\" (i.e. \\"there exists a person who is not married\\"): :\\\\lnot\\\\ \\\\exists{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, P(x) \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, \\\\lnot P(x) ot\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\lnot\\\\ \\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, P(x) \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, \\\\lnot P(x) = Other connectives = The universal (and existential) quantifier moves unchanged across the logical connectives ‚àß, ‚à®, ‚Üí, and ‚Üö, as long as the other operand is not affected; that is: \\\\begin{align} P(x) \\\\land (\\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) &\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\land Q(y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\lor (\\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) &\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\lor Q(y)),~\\\\mathrm{provided~that}~\\\\mathbf{Y} eq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\to (\\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) &\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\to Q(y)),~\\\\mathrm{provided~that}~\\\\mathbf{Y} eq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) leftarrow (\\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) &\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) leftarrow Q(y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\land (\\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) &\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\land Q(y)),~\\\\mathrm{provided~that}~\\\\mathbf{Y} eq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\lor (\\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) &\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\lor Q(y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\to (\\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) &\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\to Q(y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) leftarrow (\\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) &\\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) leftarrow Q(y)),~\\\\mathrm{provided~that}~\\\\mathbf{Y} eq \\\\emptyset \\\\end{align} Conversely, for the logical connectives ‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üõ, and ‚Üê, the quantifiers flip: \\\\begin{align} P(x) \\\\uparrow (\\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) & \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\uparrow Q(y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\downarrow (\\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) & \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\downarrow Q(y)),~\\\\mathrm{provided~that}~\\\\mathbf{Y} eq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) rightarrow (\\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) & \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) rightarrow Q(y)),~\\\\mathrm{provided~that}~\\\\mathbf{Y} eq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\gets (\\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) & \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\gets Q(y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\uparrow (\\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) & \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\uparrow Q(y)),~\\\\mathrm{provided~that}~\\\\mathbf{Y} eq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\downarrow (\\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) & \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\downarrow Q(y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) rightarrow (\\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) & \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) rightarrow Q(y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x) \\\\gets (\\\\forall{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, Q(y)) & \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\exists{y}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\, (P(x) \\\\gets Q(y)),~\\\\mathrm{provided~that}~\\\\mathbf{Y} eq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} = Rules of inference = A rule of inference is a rule justifying a logical step from hypothesis to conclusion. There are several rules of inference which utilize the universal quantifier. Universal instantiation concludes that, if the propositional function is known to be universally true, then it must be true for any arbitrary element of the universe of discourse. Symbolically, this is represented as : \\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, P(x) \\\\to\\\\ P(c) where c is a completely arbitrary element of the universe of discourse. Universal generalization concludes the propositional function must be universally true if it is true for any arbitrary element of the universe of discourse. Symbolically, for an arbitrary c, : P(c) \\\\to\\\\ \\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\, P(x). The element c must be completely arbitrary; else, the logic does not follow: if c is not arbitrary, and is instead a specific element of the universe of discourse, then P(c) only implies an existential quantification of the propositional function. = The empty set = By convention, the formula \\\\forall{x}{\\\\in}\\\\emptyset \\\\, P(x) is always true, regardless of the formula P(x); see vacuous truth.  Universal closure  The universal closure of a formula œÜ is the formula with no free variables obtained by adding a universal quantifier for every free variable in œÜ. For example, the universal closure of :P(y) \\\\land \\\\exists x Q(x,z) is :\\\\forall y \\\\forall z ( P(y) \\\\land \\\\exists x Q(x,z)).  As adjoint  In category theory and the theory of elementary topoi, the universal quantifier can be understood as the right adjoint of a functor between power sets, the inverse image functor of a function between sets; likewise, the existential quantifier is the left adjoint.Saunders Mac Lane, Ieke Moerdijk, (1992) Sheaves in Geometry and Logic Springer-Verlag. See page 58 For a set X, let \\\\mathcal{P}X denote its powerset. For any function f:X\\\\to Y between sets X and Y, there is an inverse image functor f^*:\\\\mathcal{P}Y\\\\to \\\\mathcal{P}X between powersets, that takes subsets of the codomain of f back to subsets of its domain. The left adjoint of this functor is the existential quantifier \\\\exists_f and the right adjoint is the universal quantifier \\\\forall_f. That is, \\\\exists_f\\\\colon \\\\mathcal{P}X\\\\to \\\\mathcal{P}Y is a functor that, for each subset S \\\\subset X, gives the subset \\\\exists_f S \\\\subset Y given by :\\\\exists_f S =\\\\\\\\{ y\\\\in Y \\\\;\\\\; \\\\exists x\\\\in X.\\\\ f(x)=y \\\\quad\\\\land\\\\quad x\\\\in S \\\\\\\\}, those y in the image of S under f. Similarly, the universal quantifier \\\\forall_f\\\\colon \\\\mathcal{P}X\\\\to \\\\mathcal{P}Y is a functor that, for each subset S \\\\subset X, gives the subset \\\\forall_f S \\\\subset Y given by :\\\\forall_f S =\\\\\\\\{ y\\\\in Y \\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall x\\\\in X.\\\\ f(x)=y \\\\quad\\\\implies\\\\quad x\\\\in S \\\\\\\\}, those y whose preimage under f is contained in S. The more familiar form of the quantifiers as used in first-order logic is obtained by taking the function f to be the unique function !:X \\\\to 1 so that \\\\mathcal{P}(1) = \\\\\\\\{T,F\\\\\\\\} is the two-element set holding the values true and false, a subset S is that subset for which the predicate S(x) holds, and :\\\\begin{array}{rl}\\\\mathcal{P}(!)\\\\colon \\\\mathcal{P}(1) & \\\\to \\\\mathcal{P}(X)\\\\\\\\\\\\ T &\\\\mapsto X \\\\\\\\\\\\ F &\\\\mapsto \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\}\\\\end{array} :\\\\exists_! S = \\\\exists x. S(x), which is true if S is not empty, and :\\\\forall_! S = \\\\forall x. S(x), which is false if S is not X. The universal and existential quantifiers given above generalize to the presheaf category.

It may be inwardly or outwardly directed. With a negative connotation pride refers to a foolishly and irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments, used synonymously with hubris. With a positive connotation, pride refers to a content sense of attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward a whole group of people, and is a product of praise, independent self-reflection, and a fulfilled feeling of belonging. Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a complex secondary emotion which requires the development of a sense of self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based interaction with others. Some social psychologists identify the nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional, automatically perceived signal of high social status. In contrast, pride could also be defined as a lowly disagreement with the truth. One definition of pride comes from St. Augustine: \\"the love of one's own excellence\\".\\"Est autem superbia amor proprie excellentie, et fuit initium peccati superbia.\\" A similar definition comes from Meher Baba: \\"Pride is the specific feeling through which egoism manifests.\\"Baba, Meher (1967). Discourses. 2. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 72. . Pride is sometimes viewed as corrupt or as a vice, sometimes as proper or as a virtue. While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. In Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, the greatness of soul or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt, vanity or vainglory. Pride can also manifest itself as a high opinion of one's nation (national pride), ethnicity (ethnic pride) and sexual identity. Etymology Proud comes from late Old English prut, probably from Old French prud \\"brave, valiant\\" (11th century) (which became preux in French), from Late Latin term prodis \\"useful\\", which is compared with the Latin prodesse \\"be of use\\".Article from Free Online Dictionary, accessed 9 Nov. 2008 The sense of \\"having a high opinion of oneself\\", not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' opinion of the Norman knights who called themselves \\"proud\\".Article from Online Etymology Dictionary , accessed 20 June 2014  Philosophical views  = Ancient Greek philosophy = Aristotle identified pride (megalopsuchia, variously translated as proper pride, the greatness of soul and magnanimity) as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and humility, thus: He concludes then that By contrast, Aristotle defined the vice of hubris as follows: Thus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is altogether an entirely different thing from pride.  Psychological views  Since pride is classified as an emotion or passion, it is pride both cognitive and evaluative and that its object, that which it cognizes and evaluates, is the self and its properties, or something the proud individual identifies with. Like guilt and shame, it is specifically described in the field as a self-conscious emotion that results from the evaluations of the self and one's behavior according to internal and external standards. This is further explained by the way pride results from satisfying or conforming to a standard while guilt or shame is an offshoot of defying it. An observation cites the lack of research that addresses pride because it is despised as well as valued in the individualist West where it is experienced as pleasurable. = As an emotion = In psychological terms, positive pride is \\"a pleasant, sometimes exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive self-evaluation\\". It was added by Tracy et al. to the University of California, Davis, Set of Emotion Expressions (UCDSEE) in 2009, as one of three \\"self-conscious\\" emotions known to have recognizable expressions (along with embarrassment and shame). The term \\"fiero\\" was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a personal triumph over adversity.Lazzaro, N. (2004). Why We Play Games: Four Keys to More Emotion Without Story. Retrieved from www.xeodesign.com/xeodesign_whyweplaygames.pdf Facial expressions and gestures that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status in a group. Behaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others.Tracy & Matsumoto, 2008. = Positive outcomes = A common understanding of pride is that it results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting the personal goals; for example, Weiner et al. have posited that positive performance outcomes elicit pride in an individual when the event is appraised as having been caused by him alone. Moreover, Oveis et al. conceptualize pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict. Pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It is related to \\"more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud\\" (Weiner, 1985). Pride is generally associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and outward promotion. Along with hope, it is also often described as an emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended (Fredrickson, 2001). According to Bagozzi et al., pride can have positive benefits of enhancing creativity, productivity, and altruism. For instance, it has been found that in terms of school achievement, pride is associated with a higher GPA in low neighborhood socioeconomic environments, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods, pride is associated with a lower GPA. = In economic psychology = In the field of economic psychology, pride is conceptualized in a spectrum ranging from \\"proper pride\\", associated with genuine achievements, and \\"false pride\\", which can be maladaptive or even pathological. Lea et al. have examined the role of pride in various economic situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are linked together by the selfhood of the people who take them. Understood in this way, pride is an emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short term they would appear irrational. = Sin and self-acceptance = Pride, from the Seven Deadly Sins by Jacob Matham c. 1592. Exaggerated self-esteem is called \\"pride\\".\\"pride, n.1\\". OED Online. December 2014. Oxford University Press. http://0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/Entry/151185?rskey=L7lc4z&result;=1 (accessed December 19, 2014). Classical Christian theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and thus high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human problem, but beginning in the 20th century, \\"humanistic psychology\\" diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a lack of belief in one's \\"true worth\\". Carl Rogers observed that most people \\"regard themselves as worthless and unlovable.\\" Thus, they lack self- esteem.Terry D. Cooper, Sin, Pride & Self-Acceptance: The Problem of Identity in Theology & Psychology (InterVar sity, 2003), 40, 87, 95. Terry Cooper conceptualized in 2003 excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as an important paradigm in describing the human condition. He examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women, the humanistic psychology position that pride does not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self.Cooper, T. D. (2003). Sin, pride & self-acceptance: the problem of identity in theology & psychology. Chicago: InterVarsity Press. He considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts, namely Karen Horney, offers promise in dealing with what he calls a \\"deadlock between the overvalued and undervalued self\\" (Cooper, 112‚Äì3). Cooper refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self- esteem: > The \\"idealized self,\\" the \\"tyranny of the should,\\" the \\"pride system\\" and > the nature of self-hate all point toward the intertwined relationship > between neurotic pride and self-contempt. Understanding how a neurotic pride > system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem. > (Cooper, 112‚Äì3). Thus, hubris, which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the committer of pride feels deep down. In the King James Bible, those people exhibiting excess pride are labeled with the somewhat archaic term, \\"Haughty\\". = Hubris and group pride = Hubris itself is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility (Tangney, 1999). As one might expect, Hubris is not necessarily associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions (Rhodwalt, et al.). Several studies by UC Davis psychologist Cynthia Picket about group pride, have shown that groups that boast, gloat or denigrate others tend to become a group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other groups.Study is currently in revision Suggesting that \\"hubristic, pompous displays of group pride might be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of strength,\\" she states that those that express pride by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members' efforts and hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public and personal eyes.  In different groups  = National = The Father and Mother by Boardman Robinson depicting War as the offspring of Greed and Pride.  Germany  In Germany, \\"national pride\\" (\\"Nationalstolz\\") is often associated with the former Nazi regime. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German patriotism. The World Cup in 2006, held in Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national flag from windows, as the team progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support across the nation.Sullivan, G. B. (2009). Germany during the 2006 World Cup: The role of television in creating a national narrative of pride and \\"party patriotism\\". In Castell√≥, E., Dhoest, A. & O'Donnell, H. (Eds.), The Nation on Screen, Discourses of the National in Global Television. Cambridge Scholars Press: Cambridge. By the time the semi-final against Italy came around, the level of national pride and unity was at its highest throughout the tournament, and the hosting of the World Cup is seen to have been a great success for Germany as a nation. After the World Cup, however, the subject of patriotism became again as difficult as it had been before. = Ethnic =  Asian  Asian pride in modern slang refers mostly to those of East Asian descent, though it can include anyone of Asian descent. Asian pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have had long conflicts with each other, examples are the old Japanese and Chinese religious beliefs of their superiority. Asian pride emerged prominently during European colonialism.Langguth, Gerd. German Foreign Affairs Review. \\"Dawn of the 'Pacific' Century?\\" 1996. June 30, 2007. At one time, Europeans controlled 85% of the world's land through colonialism, resulting in anti-Western feelings among Asian nations. Today, some Asians still look upon European involvement in their affairs with suspicion. In contrast, Asian empires are prominent and are proudly remembered by adherents to Asian Pride. There is an emerging discourse of Chinese pride that unfolds complex histories and maps of privileges and empowerments. In a deeper sense, it is a strategic positioning, aligned with approaches such as \\"Asia as method\\", to invite more diverse resistances in language, culture, and practices, in challenging colonial, imperial dominations, and being critical of Eurocentric epistemologies. In more specific cases, it examines the Sinophone circulations of power relations connecting the transnational to the local, for example, a particular set of Chinese-Canadian relations between China's increasing industrial materiality and output in which pride becomes an expansionist reach and mobilization of capital, Canada's active interests in tapping into Asian and Chinese labours, markets, and industrial productions, and the intersected cultural politics of 'Chinese-ness' in an East Pacific British Columbia city where 'Chinese' has been tagged as a majority-minority.  Black  Black pride is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise awareness for a black racial identity. The slogan has been used by African Americans of sub-Saharan African origin to denote a feeling of self-confidence, self-respect, celebrating one's heritage, and being proud of one's worth.  White  White pride is a slogan mainly (but not exclusively) used by white separatist, white nationalist, neo-Nazi and white supremacist organizations in the United States for a white race identity. White pride also consists of white ethnic/cultural pride. = Mental illness = Bed Push at Mad Pride parade in Cologne, Germany, in 2016 Mad pride refers to a worldwide movement and philosophy that individuals with mental illnesses should be proud of their 'mad' identity. Mad Pride advocates mutual support and rallies in support of rights for people with mental illness. The Mad Pride movement aims to reclaim the word mad as a self-descriptor. = LGBT+ = Pride parade, D√ºsseldorf 2017 Gay pride refers to a worldwide movement and philosophy asserting that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBT pride advocates work for equal \\"rights and benefits\\" for LGBTQ+ people. The movement has three main premises: that people should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity, that sexual diversity is a gift, and that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent and cannot be intentionally altered. The word pride is used in this case as an antonym for shame. Pride in this sense is an affirmation of one's self and the community as a whole. The modern \\"gay pride\\" movement began after the Stonewall riots of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the first pride parade in the United States commemorated the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots‚Äîthe nearly week-long uprising between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of Stonewall Inn.  Vanity  Detail of \\"Pride\\" in The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things by Hieronymus Bosch In conventional parlance, vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense to refer to a rational concern for one's appearance, attractiveness, and dress and is thus not the same as pride. However, it also refers to an excessive or irrational belief in one's abilities or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may in so far be compared to pride. The term Vanity originates from the Latin word vanitas meaning emptiness, untruthfulness, futility, foolishness and empty pride. Here empty pride means a fake pride, in the sense of vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics. \\"All Is Vanity\\" by C. Allan Gilbert, evoking the inevitable decay of life and beauty toward death Jacques Callot, Pride (Vanity), probably after 1621 In many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-idolatry, in which one rejects God for the sake of one's own image, and thereby becomes divorced from the graces of God. The stories of Lucifer and Narcissus (who gave us the term narcissism), and others, attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity. In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a peacock, and in Biblical terms, by the Whore of Babylon. During the Renaissance, vanity was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with a comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto. Other symbols of vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and often by the figure of death himself. Often we find an inscription on a scroll that reads Omnia Vanitas (\\"All is Vanity\\"), a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes.James Hall, Dictionary of Subjects & Symbols in Art (New York: Harper & Row, 1974), 318. Although that phrase, itself depicted in a type of still life, vanitas, originally referred not to an obsession with one's appearance, but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man's efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture. \\"The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her\\", writes Edwin Mullins, \\"while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass‚Äîa window‚Äîthrough which we peer and secretly desire her.\\"Edwin Mullins, The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women (New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc., 1985), 62‚Äì3. The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus. In his table of the seven deadly sins, Hieronymus Bosch depicts a bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil. Behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier, which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum, is An Allegory of Justice and Vanity. A young woman holds a balance, symbolizing justice; she does not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her. Vermeer's famous painting Girl with a Pearl Earring is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, as the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes. All is Vanity, by Charles Allan Gilbert (1873‚Äì1929), carries on this theme. An optical illusion, the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror. Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death.

The river widens at this place, later becoming a bay which discharges into the Atlantic Ocean and is often nicknamed \\"Bas-du-Fleuve\\" (Lower-River). The region is formed by 8 regional county municipalities and 114 municipalities. In the south, it borders Maine and New Brunswick and the regions of Chaudi√®re-Appalaches and Gasp√©sie‚Äì√éles-de-la-Madeleine. It had a population of 197,385 and a land area of as of the 2016 Census. The territory has seen human occupation since the Pleistocene by First Nations until European colonisation started in the late 17th century with the concession of tenures. However, development of the region was slow until it started to exploit its mixed forests, which allowed it to grow and the settling further inland, on the littoral and the development of a leisure industry. Its geography is marked by the Saint Lawrence River to the northwest, the Notre Dame Mountains section of the Appalachians, as well as the Matap√©dia and T√©miscouata valleys, which forms the natural communication corridors with the Gasp√© Peninsula, Maine, and the Maritimes.  Etymology and toponymy  The region takes its name from the Saint Lawrence River, a waterway that has a central role in the history of Quebec and forms the northern border of the region. The name of the river, and by extension the region, has a hagiotoponymic origin originating from the baye sainct Laurens named by Jacques Cartier, originating from the date of discovery being 10 August 1535, day of the festival of Saint Lawrence in the Christian martyrology. The name of the bay was used again to describe the river when the Narration, his report of his expedition, was translated to Spanish and Italian, and definitively fixed by its use in the world map of cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569, according to historian Marcel Trudel. The name \\"Bas-Saint-Laurent\\", however, only appeared much later. In their Histoire du Bas-Saint-Laurent, the historians Fortin and Lechasseur assert that the relation with the Saint Lawrence grew with the population of the region in the 19th century. The first mention of the name is attributed to a report from the Rimouskois deputy and writer Joseph-Charles Tach√©, which used the term to describe \\"the two shores of the Bas-Saint-Laurent except the Gasp√© district\\". The authors, however, write that Tach√© preferred most of the time to use more precise and well-known references, like the counties of Montmorency and Rimouski. Even if the name of the region was present on a map made in 1863 by Stanislas Drapeau, it took time to settle in; the expression \\"le Bas du Fleuve\\" being preferred. With the settlement of T√©miscouata and la Matap√©dia, the name start imposing itself between 1920 and 1960, when a number of enterprises and organisms of the region delimitated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rimouski and Rivi√®re- du-Loup, like the Compagnie de transport du Bas St-Laurent and the Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas-Saint-Laurent or the newspaper l'√âcho du Bas St-Laurent adopt it. After being eclipsed for two decades when the State tried to erase regional differences by putting in place shared administrative structures east of the Quebec, the start of the 1980s sees this policy change, as the great region Bas-Saint-Laurent-Gasp√©sie is split into two different territories, being more accurate for the distinctive cultural traditions of these regions. The evolution of the toponymy of the region takes root in the different steps of its development, with at first the initial settlement by First Nations, followed by a progressive settlement by French-speaking colonists starting in the 18th century, but mostly in the 19th, a small Scottish presence starting in the 1800s, with activities centred on agriculture and the exploitation of its waters and forests. The last phase of this evolution took place when some inland communities started to decline and its centres of activity were reinforced.  Geography  = Situation and political divisions = Map of Bas-Saint-Laurent with regional counties The Bas-Saint-Laurent is a region in the East of Quebec, delimited to the north by the Saint Lawrence River, to the south by New-Brunswick and Maine, to the east by the Gasp√© Peninsula and to the west by C√¥te-du-Sud. It extends over an area of , with of land area, which represents a bit less than 2% of the total area of Quebec, however, this area also represents 10% of the inhabited area of Quebec, or about half the land area of Switzerland. The region is divided into eight Regional county municipalities (RCM), which contain 130 municipalities. Bas Saint-Laurent contained 200,462 inhabitants in 2011, of which 55,400 were in its most populous RCM, Rimouski-Neigette. Otherwise, the least populous RCM of the region is Les Basques, with only 9,000 inhabitants in 2011, a number which decreased by 1,300 since 1996, making it also the RCM with the highest annual rate of population decrease of the region, with a rate of 9.6% between 2006 and 2011. Forested areas and waterways dominate the land use of Bas-Saint- Laurent. The region counts of mixed forests, of coniferous forests and of waterways. Humid lands only covers and the land devoted to agriculture covers , while developed areas represent only , which equals to 0.5% of the total land area of the region. = Geology = Even if an isolated area of Cambrian and Precambrian rocks exist in an area of the Chic-Choc Mountains, the region belongs generally to the geologic province of the Appalachian Mountains, which covers an area of , between Alabama and Newfoundland. The marks of two episodes of mountain-building, the Acadian orogeny and the Taconic orogeny, have shaped the land. During the first orogeny, the subduction of the oceanic plate created a volcanic chain in the Iapetus Ocean, off the coast of Laurentia during the Cambrian period. The magma surfacing mixed with the sediments originating from the continental erosion and the volcanic arc of islands got gradually closer to the continent to the subduction. The two collided 450 million years ago and formed a chain of immature mountains, the Taconic Mountains, their nappe covers a part of the Saint Lawrence Lowlands. This first zone, which follows the river today, is known as Humber's zone. Dating from the Ordovician, this bedrock is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks : sandstone, mudrocks and conglomerates. South of this zone, the Gasp√© belt is the remnant of a second mountain formation during Siluro-Devonian times. Around 430 million years ago, the Taconic mountains eroded and created sediments that deposited at a shallow depth. As Laurentia and the micro- continent Avalonia deformed and raised the sedimentary deposits and volcanic rocks and created a second chain of mountains, the Acadian Chain, which superposes itself on the Taconic Chain. = Seismicity = The estuary of the Saint Lawrence river in front of the Charlevoix region is one of the most active seismic regions in the east of Canada. Five earthquakes of a magnitude superior to 6 have occurred in history, in February 1663, December 1791, October 1860, October 1870 and February 1925. The distribution of these earthquakes indicates a concentration in the estuary, near La Malbaie and Rivi√®re-du-Loup. Surveys and the establishment of a seismometer network were conducted in the 1970s and allowed to circumscribe the seismically active area in an area of on along the Saint Lawrence River, this zone includes the towns of La Malbaie, Baie-Saint-Paul and La Pocati√®re. The seismic data indicates that an earthquake happens on average every 36 hours in the Charlevois- Kamouraska zone. They are concentrated in the Precambrian bedrock under the Logan line and the Appalachian Mountains, at a variable depth between deep and the surface Another seismic area located in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, in a triangle between the towns of Matane, Baie-Comeau and Sept-√éles. However, this seismic area is less active than the one uphill, as only an average of sixty earthquakes occur each year and has not had a destructive earthquake in history. An earthquake of magnitude 5.1 occurred in 1944 east of Godbout and another of the same magnitude occurred on the 16 March 1999, its epicentre was located at about south of Sept-√éles. = Topography = Saint-Andr√© The topography of Bas-Saint-Laurent has two main elements : the plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains, called Notre Dame Mountains, and the lowlands in the fine stripe of land along the Saint Lawrence river. These are separated by an intermediate area of ridges and foothills which meld with the plateaus. The Notre Dame Mountains, are a group of small mountains with summits reaching between high. the landscape is sometimes interrupted by valleys, like the T√©miscouata valley or Matapedia Valley. These two parallel valleys allow access to The Maritimes, Maine and Chaleur Bay. The littoral, spanning across is composed of riverside land of altitudes ranging from above sea level. This area has a depth of before reaching the mountains in the west of the region, but reaches in the vicinity of Rimouski, only to shrink again in the eastern limits of the region. This riverside land disappears entirely between the municipalities of Sainte-F√©licit√© and Grosses-Roches. In the western part of the territory, this littoral plain is interrupted by inselbergs, ridges reaching that can reach 200m in height, typical of the riverside land of Bas- Saint-Laurent In the Quaternary, the region was marked by glaciation. the Wisconsin glaciation caused the crust to sink by in the vicinity of Rimouski. When the end of the glaciation started in 18,000 BP, it opened a sound in the Saint-Laurent valley, isolating the glacier covering Bas-Saint-Laurent from the one covering C√¥te-Nord. The isostatic rebound created an inland sea, the Sea of Goldthwait, which flooded the region under at most 200m of water in the area around Rimouski. The withdrawal of the Sea of Goldthwait was gradual, 2,000 years ago the isostatic rebound stabilised at around per year, the withdrawal of the water formed a number of narrow streaks of emerged land near the riverside between Rivi√®re-du-Loup and Rimouski, known today as √éle aux Li√®vres, √éle Verte, √Æle aux Basques, √Æle du Bic and √Æle Saint-Barnab√©. = Hydrography = Matap√©dia River in Causapscal The estuary of the Saint Lawrence river, to the north of the region, plays a primary role in the region. It is divided in two regions split at Cacouna: west of Cacouna, it is called a medium estuary, while east of the municipality it is called a maritime estuary or lower estuary. The region is relatively poor in fresh water, since lakes and rivers only count as 1.5% of the land area. It possesses two hydrographic regions, the first holds all the streams that pour into the estuary of the Saint-Lawrence river and the region of Chaleur Bay and Perc√©, whose streams flow south into New-Brunswick and Maine. These regions influenced the layout of the administrative areas of Bas-Saint-Laurent, by setting limits to some regional county municipalities. The largest drainage basins of the region are located in the south of the territory. These are the drainage basins of the Matapedia River () and Madawaska River (). Ranking third, the drainage basin of the Cascap√©dia River of , half of this basin is located within the limits of the administrative region. Among the notable rivers pouring into the Saint-Lawrence, we can count the Mitis River (), Matane River (), Rimouski River (), Rivi√®re du Loup () and Trois Pistoles River (). Bas-Saint-Laurent counts 2,417 lakes, of which 90% do not exceed an area of . About 30% of them are situated in the RCM of Rimouski-Neigette. The two largest lakes of the region are Lake T√©miscouata () and Lake Matapedia (), significant human settlement on their shore has taken place, as well as along the roads going through their valleys. These lakes also distinguish themselves by their north west and south west orientation, compared to most of the other lakes of the region which prefer to follow the orientation of the creases and breaks of the Appalachian Mountains. = Climate = Saint-Paul-de-la-Croix Bas-Saint-Laurent, like the rest of Quebec, is a Nordic American territory. The Quebecois geographer Louis-Edmond Hamelin categorized the region in his pre-north area, second of the five zones of his map of nordicity zones. The oceanic influence of the estuary of the Saint Lawrence River has a small influence on the climate of the region, making it more alike to the climate of meridional Quebec, than with \\"nordic\\" towns like La Sarre in Abitibi or Roberval, Quebec in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, located at the same latitude than the town of Matane. However, the climate of Bas-Saint-Laurent is of continental type, with a \\"great amplitude and no dry periods\\". The French geographer Raoul Blanchard described the temperature variations between winter and summer as \\"brutal\\". During the winter, which lasts for five months, the cold freezes the lakes and rivers and transforms the estuary into a \\"vast prairie of ice\\". The oceanic influence, while it mitigates the cold of the winters, cools the summers. The average temperature in July in Rimouski inferior by 4 degrees to the one recorded in Quebec. To this, the wind of the north west adds humidity and cold. Rainfall is abundant and consistent throughout the year. The region currently receives annually of rainfall, of which between is snow. The oceanic influence is less present inland, where slightly warmer temperatures in the summer and slightly colder in the winter are recorded.  Natural environment  = Flora = Chic-Choc Mountains in Sayabec Bas-Saint-Laurent is part of the natural province of the Appalachian Mountains in the ecological reference area of Quebec. The forests of Bas- Saint-Laurent are 8,000 years old. Beyond inhabited areas, they cover the majority of the territory. They are boreal with a coniferous influence. The forests most important in order of superficy are those of golden birch, paper birch and white spruce. The dominant forest of the territory is composed of golden birch trees, an Ecotone marking the transition between the temperate nordique area and the boreal area. It is located mainly in the highest part of the Appalachian plateau. The main species of trees within it are the paper birch, the balsam fir, and the white spruce, as well as rarer quaking aspens and jack pines. The second forest in superficy is composed of primarily golden birch, and covers 35% of the forested area of the region. It is mainly located in the centre of Bas-Saint-Laurent between Rivi√®re-du-Loup and Rimouski. The main species of trees within it are the golden birch, balsam fir, white spruce, red spruce and the cedar, as well as rarer quaking apens, paper birches, balsam poplars and mountain maple. However, a more profound analysis of the composition of the forests of Bas-Saint-Laurent allows to shed light on which trees grow at which elevations, type of soils and latitudes. Miroslav Grandtner categorized the south west end of the region, the littoral stripe before Riv√®re-du-Loup and the medium plateau in the golden birch forest, the high plateau as part of the paper birch forest, and finally, the Chic-Choc Mountains as part of the white spruce forest. = Fauna = White-tailed deer fawn in Bic National Park The fauna of Bas-Saint-Laurent is similar to the one found in other parts of Quebec and has a relatively poor diversity in species. The glacial episodes of the Pleistocene drove away the animals of the ice- covered area and these came back gradually as the ice sheet melted over the last 18,000 years. The melting of the ice sheet and the flood of the sea of Goldthwait around the current estuary brought molluscs like true mussels, soft-shell clams and scallops. belugas and other whales visit it. According to the remains of marine mammals found in altitude further inland, narvals, walruses and earless seals were also present in the region. On land, the eider appears around 18,000 BP and a mastodon closely related to the mammoth inhabited the area before disappearing 8000 years ago. Today, the region is dominated by the big game moose, white-tailed deer and black bear. The small game is composed of the ruffed grouse, the spruce grouse and snowshoe hare. The muskrat, North American beaver and red fox are also usual sights in the forests of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Many species of birds live along the estuary of Saint Lawrence. The Canada goose, snow goose and brant do a halt in the tidal marshes located along the litoral between La Pocati√®re and Pointe-au-P√®re. Diverse types of duck are present, like the American black duck, Northern pintail, two types of surface duck. Diving ducks are represented by the common goldeneye and ring-necked duck, while sea ducks are represented by the common eider and long-tailed duck. = Environmental protection = White geese in Baie de l'Isle-Verte Bas-Saint-Laurent has only one wetland area according to the Ramsar Convention, the Baie de l'Isle-Verte, part of it is protected by the national wildlife reserve of baie de L'Isle-Verte. This swamp is primarily occupied by cordgrasses and is an important nesting area for the American black duck, as well as a stop for migratory birds in spring. The region has four national parks. The Lac-T√©miscouata National Park is located east of the Lake T√©miscouata and protects a representative part of the Notre Dame Mountains and several ancient forests. The Bic National Park, near Rimouski, protects the litoral of the south of the estuary of Saint Lawrence. The Gasp√©sie National Park , of which only a small part is within the limits of the region, is characterized by several summits taller than . Its diverse climate and its landscape host a flora unique in Quebec. Finally, about 30% of the Saguenay‚ÄìSt. Lawrence Marine Park, the first marine park of Quebec, is located in the region. It holds the longest fjord in the east of Canada as well as a part of the largest estuary in the world, which makes it a location of considerable marine biodiversity. It is the only park administered in Canada by both the Government of Quebec and Government of Canada. Three other parks, ecological reserves, more restricted protected areas, are located in the centre of the region, the reserves of Fernald, Charles-B.-Banville and Ir√®ne-Fournier. At the same level of protection, there are six floristic parks, most of the them within the Gasp√©sie National Park. The largest protected areas of the region are those protected by the confinement areas of the white-tailed deer. Just these protected areas cover nearly 80% of the protected area of the region. Bas-Saint-Laurent contains about 27% of the protected areas of this designation. The second largest designation by superficy are the protected areas devoted to the protection of aquatic birds, of which a large part () are in a marine environment. Although they are not strictly considered protected areas, the territories structured for the gestion of wildlife cover 45,5% of the surface area of the region. They are divided in four wildlife reserves and five Zone d'exploitation contr√¥l√©e.  Demography  Rimouski, the largest city in Bas-Saint-Laurent After reaching its peak in the middle of the 20th century due to the strong natality and a reduction of child mortality, the inhabited area of Bas-Saint-Laurent has declined over the last 50 years. This observation is not unique to the region however, as the population living on the south shore of the estuary, in the regions of C√¥te-du-Sud, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gasp√©sie, has dropped from 9.3 to 5.4% of the total population of Quebec between 1951 and 1991. This decline is due to structural issues like the rationalization of agriculture and the depletion of the forests, but also to rural flight and a sinking natality since the 1960s. = Population = Bas-Saint-Laurent was home to 200,500 inhabitants on the first of July 2011, which represents 2.5% of the total population of Quebec. This number indicates that this share has dropped by 4% since 1996. More than 40% of the population of the region lives in two RCMs, Rimouski-Neigette (55,364 inhabitants in 2011) and Rivi√®re-du-Loup (34,326 inhabitants in 2011). Since 1951, the region has seen its population stagnate or slightly decline. This is due to two opposing factors, the decline of rural areas and the reinforcement of urban areas, like Rimouski and Rivi√®re-du-Loup. The share of these two towns alone went from 16% of the total population of the region in 1951 to 34% in 2001. The new importance of these urban centres explain the fact that only their RCMs have had a population increase between 1951 and 2001. Opposite to these, RCMs devoid of a strong urban centre, like La Matap√©dia, T√©miscouata and Les Basques, have been the RCMs where the population has dropped the most in the region. Accounting for the population decrease observed since 1951, even when Quebec's population has increased by 82%, it is not surprising that the share of the population of Quebec living in Bas-Saint-Laurent has decreased from 5.2% in 1951 to 2.8% in 2001. = Age = The population of Bas-Saint-Laurent is significantly older than the population of Quebec as a whole. In 2011, the average age of the population of Bas-Saint- Laurent was 47.3 years, making it the second oldest province of Quebec by that criteria, behind neighboring Gasp√©sie‚Äì√éles-de-la-Madeleine (49.0 years) and just before the region in third place, Mauricie (47.2). The share of youths under the age of 20 is also one of the lowest of Quebec, at 19.5%, compared to the average of 21.7%. As is the case for data on population, the data on the age of said population shows a clear divide between the two urban RCMs and the rural ones. The RCM Les Basques sees an important aging of its population and has the lowest share of youths between 0 and 19 years old (17.5), the population over 65 years old has the largest share (25.6%), and the average age of 51 years is the highest of the region in 2011. = Language = Nearly all residents of Bas-Saint-Laurent speak French as their mother tongue. According to the 2006, 98.6% of those who responded declared their native tongue to be French, 0.6% declared English, and 0.8% listed a different language. Only 315 peopled indicated both French and English to be their native tongues, and 86 cited French and another language. The proportion of Bas-Saint-Laurent residents reporting they can speak both French and English was 15.6%, compared to 40.6% in all of Quebec. This share was greater in the two largest cities of the region, reaching 21.7% in Rimouski and 18.0% in Rivi√®re-du-Loup. Among smaller towns, Notre-Dame-du-Lac stood out with a bilingual rate of 20.3%. In the region, 140 people reported they only spoke English, and 125 others reported that they could not speak either French or English. = Immigration = The regional conference of elected representatives considers immigration to be a major issue for the economic and social development of Bas-Saint-Laurent and expends great efforts to attract new inhabitants, it also creates programs of insertion and promotion for them. Bas-Saint-Laurent welcomed 585 immigrants between 2001 and 2006, which is about 30% of the 2000 inhabitants who migrated there according to the 2006 census. The RCM of Rimouski-Neigette welcomed more than half (310) of the new arrivals in the region between 2001 and 2006 These numbers must however be put in relation to the fact that 77.3% of the 236,975 immigrants to settle in Quebec between 1998 and 2007 chose the metropolitan region of Montr√©al, Bas- Saint-Laurent received only 0.2% of the immigrants that came to Quebec during this period. = Demographic projection = According to the most recent demographic projection from the Institut de la statistique du Qu√©bec, the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent will register a slight decline to 198,600 in 2031. According to this prediction, the proportion of inhabitants above 65 years old should reach 36% and will be twice as large as the share of inhabitants between 0 and 19 years old. This demographic prediction settles that the average age of the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent would reach 53 years, an increase of 6% compared to the latest data. The positive net migration rate will be insufficient in countering the negative rate of natural increase of the population.  History  = Prehistory and proto-history = The first inhabitants of the area that is now known as Bas-Saint-Laurent lived on the shore of the estuary soon after the glaciers melted Archeological excavations between 1980 and 1990 around Bic and Rimouski indicate an amerindian presence during the Paleoindian, between 9,000 and 8,000 BP years, according to Pierre Dumais and Gilles Rousseau. and between 10,000 and 8,000 BP years according to Claude Chapdelaine. Paleoindian sites discovered on an ancient beach above and a sea shelf contained stone tools and lithic flakes, indicating an industry belonging to the Plano culture. These nomads inhabited the region and practiced a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. A second period, the Archaic covers about 5,000 years and starts at around 7,000 BP to end 2,500 years ago in the south of Quebec. In 1977, researchers listed 19 sites in the region; six near the estuary and thirteen inland. The Archaic Period is characterised by nomad populations using various methods to use more efficiently the resources of the land. The sites are often located near small lakes or along rivers like the Touladi River in the T√©miscouata. The artifacts discovered seem to indicate these groups preferred hunting rather than fishing. Four sites are located in the Bic National Park. The most ancient, dated at around 4,000 years old, is located on the east shore of the Orignal's Cape. It is an old abandoned marine shelf abandoned 1,000 years ago by the Sea of Goldthwait. Aside from tools and lithic flakes, archeologists also found broken and heated stones, sign that the inhabitants created hearths with which they cooked food and maybe smoked the meat. = Basque people = Just like the Normands and the Bretons, Basque fishermen started exploiting the marine ressources of the estuary and gulf of the Saint Lawrence in the 16th century. Their presence is confirmed as early as the 1520s and becomes more frequent right after the expeditions of Jacques Cartier. Around 1560, the Basque own √† fleet of a hundred cod-fishers and thirty whalers. They first exploit the abundant ressources present in the estuary and the banks of Newfoundland, but around 1570, it seems the reduced numbers of whale colonies push them to search for them all the way to the medium estuary of the Saint Lawrence. The hunt is mainly located at the level of the chasse Saguenay fjord. L'√Æle aux Basques, located in front of Trois-Pistoles, on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River, it becomes a privileged place for the Basque to skin the whales captured in the area and melt their fat. Three furnaces still stand to remind us of this activity. = Slow colonization of the littoral = Even if under French rule, more than twenty segnories were granted along the bank of the river, all the way to M√©tis, and even inland (the segnories of Madawaska, Lac-Mitis and Lac-Matap√©dia), the settlement of Bas-Saint-Laurent remains sparse until 1790. With the exception of Kamouraska, which had a quicker colonization, in the prolongation of C√¥te-du-Sud and the royal path, Bas- Saint-Laurent remains isolated. When conquered, around 1760, the population east of Kamouraska is composed of a couple dozen families of pioneers and is concentrated in four seignories : Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Isle-Verte, Trois-Pistoles and Rimouski. In 1790, Bas-Saint-Laurent, with the exception of Kamouraska, is home to barely 1250 inhabitants spread across hundreds of kilometers of shore, between Notre-Dame-du-Portage and Matane. The construction of the Chemin du Portage around 1783 which allowed to link the valley of the Saint-Laurent with the British colonies of the Maritimes, which makes the area less isolated, but doesn't induce any permanent settlement alongside its path. Between 1790 and 1831, the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent in the old county of Rimouski (east of Kamouraska) goes from 1,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. The one of the county of Kamouraska nearly triples by changing from 5,500 to 15,000 inhabitants. This increase in population is due to both a strong natural growth and migration from more western regions. This settlement allows a nearly continuous exploitation of the Ribbon farms on the banks of the river in some places and the establishment of the first farms inland. Around Cacouna, in 1831, the settlement has already progressed enough to reach the fourth layer of farms. It is also around this time that the isolation is broken: in 1830, one can go to Rimouski by the royal path. The years which follow the conquest are full of hardship for the catholic clergy. Even if the population justify it, the bishop struggles to make the British authorities recognize the new parishes. The first parish of Bas-Saint-Laurent east of Kamouraska is Cacouna, created in 1825, a century and a half after the arrival of the first un si√®cle et demi apr√®s l'arriv√©e des premiers pioneers. Even if a number of families of Scottish origin settle in the area in the 1820s in the region of, following John MacNider, however the French-speaking population will remain the strong majority of the region. = End of isolation = Mouth of Rimouski River and the village in 1840 The region's population increased from 400 inhabitants in 1829 to 11,169 in 1881. Three factors explain this rise. First, the development of agriculture in the lowlands is booming. Second, entrepreneurs like William Price establish sawmills which creates opportunities of employment for factory and forest workers, favorable trade with the United Kingdom and the United States allows this industry to profit with their exports finally, Rimouski turns into a regional centre of services with the establishment of a courthouse in 1862, the creation of the diocese of Rimouski in 1867 and the opening of a seminar in 1871. The development of transportation, in particular the service assured by the Intercolonial Railway since 1873, creates a boom in trade and pushes agriculture to specialize in dairy production. Taking advantage of the large supply of lumber inland, the enterprise Price Brothers and Company builds a large sawmill at the mouth of the Rimouski River in 1899. The Great Depression of the 1930s reduces lumber demand and forces part of the population to migrate further inland; the colonization period between 1880 and 1930 sees a number of failures leading to the closure of a number of plusieurs √©checs menant √† la fermeture de parishes due to the exodus of their inhabitants. with the creation of the colonies of Esprit-Saint, de La Trinit√©-des-Monts et de Saint-Eug√®ne-de-Ladri√®re, the inhabited area reaches its maximum. In May 1950, a fire in the sawmill of the Price Brothers spreads over large parts of Rimouski and forces the region to re-allocate its resources towards services. The development of the mining, forestry and hydroelectric industries in C√¥te-Nord allows entrepreneurs like Jules-A. Brillant to develop a bustling business in the sectors of communication, transportation, wholesale and construction. With renewed involvement of the state after the Quiet Revolution, Rimouski affirms itself as the capital of the region and its service center. This change in the regional economy will negatively impact the hinterland, whose population reinforces Rimouski and the neighboring towns, like Saint-Anaclet-de-Lessard and the old municipalities of Le Bic, Rimouski-Est and Pointe-au-P√®re. = Contemporary period = In reaction to this rural flight, the federal and provincial governments establish in the 1960s, a test program of spatial planning in the regions of Gasp√©sie and Bas-Saint-Laurent. The Bureau d'am√©nagement de l'Est du Qu√©bec (BAEQ) is created in 1963 and the planners work for three years on a plan to raise the quality of life of the population by notably improving the mobility and formation of the workforce. The second part of the plan is the closure of villages in the hinterland of Bas-Saint- Laurent and the relocation of thousands inhabitants. A movement of protest, the Op√©rations Dignit√©, are organized between 1970 and 1972 in the communities affected by the plan by the priests of their respective parishes. The first of these operations takes place in the hinterland of Matane and in the Matap√©dia Valley, followed by a second in the hinterland of Rimouski and in T√©miscouata and a third in the east end of Gasp√©sie. In response to these protests the governments reconsiders the plan and cancels the closure of these villages. In the early 1980s, the government of Quebec decentralizes its spatial planning and grants to the regions a part of the responsibility in the management policies of their territory. The old county councils created after the abolition of the seigniorial system, in 1855, are turned into regional county municipalities (RCM) in 1982 and are granted the responsabilit√© of the spatial planning of the territory. Noting the failure of a forced merger of the two regions in the 1960s, the administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent-Gasp√©sie- √éles-de-la-Madeleine is divided by the government in December 1987. The new administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent keeps roughly the eastern border that was created in 1788 during the first carving of the territory for administrative purposes. In this new region, the RCM of Kamouraska becomes the eighth RCM of the region. In 2012, the region contains 130 municipalities of which 114 belong to the administrative class of local municipalities grouped in eight RCM. the number of municipalities has been in a constant drop for 25 years. It went from 145 in 1986 to 135 in 1996. Six of these RCM have direct access to the estuary of the Saint Lawrence de ces MRC, the two othersLa Matap√©dia and T√©miscouata are entirely landlocked. Fourteen unorganized areas, most of which are uninhabited, do not belong to any municipality. These areas, which contain 37% of the land area of the region, are administered by the RCM which are responsible of the local services. There also exist two Indian reserves under the jurisdiction of the Maliseet First Nation of Viger. The bureau of the community stands on an area of 0.17 hectare, located alongside the river Cacouna, while an area of , located along the route 185 in a forested area of the canton of Whitworth, holds the function of a meeting point for the community. The two territories do not possess any permanent inhabitant.  Politics and administration  =Subdivisions= *Regional County Municipalities (RCM), with populations per 2016 census  Kamouraska - 21,073  La Matap√©dia - 17,925  La Mitis - 18,210  Les Basques - 8,694  La Matanie - 21,301  Rimouski-Neigette - 56,650  Rivi√®re-du-Loup - 33,958  T√©miscouata - 19,574 *Indian Reserves  Cacouna (not to be confused with Cacouna the city)  Whitworth Inside the RCMs are important cities including: * Rimouski (Rimouski-Neigette RCM) * Rivi√®re-du-Loup (Rivi√®re-du-Loup RCM) * Matane (La Matanie RCM) * Mont-Joli (La Mitis RCM) * Amqui (La Matap√©dia RCM)  Cities  = Rimouski = Rimouski As a service centre, the city of Rimouski is the main urban centre of Bas-Saint-Laurent, located on the south bank of the St. Lawrence, east of Quebec City. Located away from the capital of the nation, the city is the economic, social and cultural metropolis of the region. A number of major regional institutions, like Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Rimouski, the c√©gep de Rimouski, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rimouski, the courthouse, the federal and provincial public administration, the seat of a number of companies and the regional hospital of Rimouski, the most important hospital centre of eastern Quebec, are located there. With a population of 47,687 inhabitants in 2012, this new city created in 2002, as part of the municipal reorganizations which occurred across Quebec. In this reorganization the city of Rimouski was fused with the municipalities of Rimouski-Est, Pointe-au-P√®re, Sainte-Odile-sur-Rimouski, Sainte-Blandine and Mont-Lebel. Another process of municipal fusion added the municipality Le Bic to the city on the 16 of September 2009. The area of the new city covers and extends itself along the route 132 and the river on . = Rivi√®re-du-Loup = Rivi√®re-du-Loup Rivi√®re-du-Loup is the second most important city of Bas-Saint-Laurent. The main concurrent of Rimouski, the city houses 19,695 inhabitants in 2012. It is the result of the merging of Rivi√®re- du-Loup with the municipality of the parish of Saint-Patrice-de-la-Rivi√®re-du- Loup. = Matane = Matane The city of Matane is the third-largest city of the region by population. Granted as a fief and seigniory to Mathieu D'Amours in 1667 when it was a trading post of the fur trade and a fishing port, it is also the easternmost city of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Matane is sometimes considered as part of Gasp√©sie, like in the tourism sector where it is part of the touristic region of Gasp√©sie. Two small neighboring municipalities, Petit-Matane and Saint-Luc-de-Matane were appended to the city in 2001. Matane was home to 14,504 inhabitants in 2012. = Other cities = Amqui Mont-Joli (6,673 inhabitants in 2012) is a turning plate of transportation in eastern Quebec. It is the eastern end of the autoroute 20 since 2008, The city contains a train station and Mont-Joli Airport operating regular flights to Montreal, Quebec, C√¥te-Nord and the Magdalen Islands. A foundry and transformation factories of goods taken from the forest are the main employers of the city. Located at the confluence of the Matap√©dia and Humqui rivers, Amqui (6,292 inhabitants in 2012) is the most important town of the Matapedia Valley and the administrative centre of RCM of La Matap√©dia. Founded in 1907, the exploitation of the surrounding forest long constituted the main activity of the city. Today, the forestry industry of Matapedia seeks to optimize their use of the wood with projects to develop the use of the residual biomass for energetic ends and the production of goods of second and third transformation in collaboration with the Service de recherche et d‚Äôexpertise en transformation des produits forestiers (SEREX), an entity attached to the c√©gep de Rimouski. T√©miscouata-sur-le-Lac (5,085 inhabitants in 2012), is the result of the fusion of the towns of Cabano and Notre-Dame- du-Lac in 2010. This administrative centre of the RCM of T√©miscouata, like the rest of its RCM, owes its wealth principally to agriculture, the maple syrup industry and forestry. Since 1976, the factory Norampac owned by the company Cascades which manufactures corrugated fiberboard and a manufacturer of prefabricated homes are established in the municipality. La Pocati√®re (4,242 inhabitants in 2012) is the largest city of the RCM of Kamouraska. Seat of the Diocese of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocati√®re, of the c√©gep de La Pocati√®re and one of the two campuses of the Institut de technologie agroalimentaire, the city has had a strong agricultural sector since the end of the 17th century. Its economy benefits from the presence of a factory assembling rolling stocks owned by the company Bombardier Transportation. Trois-Pistoles (3,471 inhabitants in 2012) is the administrative centre of the RCM Les Basques, the least populated of the eight RCMs of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Its economy is dominated by agriculture and tourism. =School districts= Francophone: * Commission scolaire du Fleuve-et-des-Lacs (Les Basques and T√©miscouata). * Commission scolaire de Kamouraska - Rivi√®re-du-Loup * Commission scolaire des Monts-et-Mar√©es (La Matap√©dia and Matane). * Commission scolaire des Phares (La Mitis and Rimouski-Neigette). Anglophone: * Eastern Shores School Board =Representation and political tendencies= Since the modification of the electoral map of Quebec in 2011, three constituencies are entirely located inside the region of Bas-Saint-Laurent: Matane-Matap√©dia, Rimouski et Rivi√®re- du-Loup‚ÄìT√©miscouata. The voters of the western part of the region are part of the constituency of C√¥te-du-Sud, shared between the regions of Bas-Saint- Laurent and Chaudi√®re-Appalaches. The Maliseet are also represented by the Maliseet First Nation of Viger.  Provincial representation  The region is represented in the National Assembly of Quebec since the 2014 Quebec general election by : * Matane-Matap√©dia : Pascal B√©rub√© (PQ) *Rimouski : Harold LeBel (PQ). * Rivi√®re-du-Loup‚ÄìT√©miscouata : Jean D'Amour (QLP) * C√¥te- du-Sud : Norbert Morin (QLP). With the exception of Rimouski's, all constituencies voted \\"no\\" during the 1980 Quebec referendum. In 1992, the five constituencies of Bas-Saint-Laurent refused the Charlottetown Accord. Three years later, every constituency votes \\"yes\\" to the 1995 Quebec referendum.  Federal representation  Bas-Saint-Laurent is represented in the House of Commons of Canada since the 2015 Canadian federal election by : * Rimouski- Neigette‚ÄîT√©miscouata‚ÄîLes Basques, situ√©e enti√®rement dans la r√©gion administrative: Guy Caron (NPD) ; * Montmagny‚ÄîL'Islet‚ÄîKamouraska‚ÄîRivi√®re-du- Loup, regroupent des √©lecteurs de Chaudi√®re-Appalaches: Bernard G√©n√©reux (CPC) ; * Avignon‚ÄîLa Mitis‚ÄîMatane‚ÄîMatap√©dia, also contains voters from the region of Gasp√©sie‚Äì√éles-de-la-Madeleine: R√©mi Mass√© (LPC).  Economy  The economy of Bas-Saint-Laurent was long dominated by two traditional industries: agriculture and forestry, with, in keeping with the location, additional fishing and tourism industries. The fishing industry traditionally exploited mostly species like the cod, the herring, and the eel; this was supplemented by the harvest of crustaceans and seaweed. This last good was either exported to the United States or used locally to produce mattresses and cushions. While agriculture was first only present in the narrow valley near the banks of the river, forestry was already a critical industry in the mid 1800s, and expands in the plateaus of the hinterland later on. Since the start of the 20th century, the region is turning towards the second and third transformations of its ressources and is attempting to create new markets, notably in marine technology and biotechnology, environmentally friendly construction and peat usage. Like in the rest of Quebec, the economy of the region is dominated by small and medium companies, as 96% employ less than 50 people. = Gross domestic product and disposable income = Often considered as a resource well by the government of Quebec, Bas-Saint-Laurent possesses a strong divide between its four industrial centers, Rimouski, Rivi√®re-du-Loup, La Pocati√®re and Matane, as these benefited from the growth of the knowledge and high tech industry to assure their development and the smaller communities outside of these industrial centers often depending on a single industry from sectors in difficulty. The Institut de la statistique du Qu√©bec reports that the gross domestic product of the region was of 5 billions in 2009, registering a growth of 1.3% compared to the previous year. The growth of the service economy is the main factor in this growth, and it now represents 70% of the regional economy, a figure close to the 71.6% of Quebec as a whole. In the good production sector, traditional industries register a sharp decline, as forestry declines by 25%, while the industries transforming wood and the paper industry decline by more than 12%. The GDP per capita of the region was at $30,376 in 2010, which puts Bas-Saint-Laurent at the 13th place among the 17 Administrative regions of Quebec. The disposable and discretionary income was at $29,069. Excluding the amount taken by direct taxation and non-wage labour costs, the income per capita is at $23,044, the smallest income in Quebec after the neighbouring region of Gasp√©sie‚Äì√éles-de-la-Madeleine. Each inhabitant of Bas-Saint-Laurent receives an average of $7,021 from the state, an amount superior the average of $5878 in Quebec. The unemployment rate being above Quebec's average and the larger share of the population eligible to receive benefits from the government program of Old Age Security and Retraite Quebec explain this more generous welfare. Statistics on the regional level do hide significant differences between the two most urbanized RCMs, Rimouski- Neigette and Rivi√®re-du-Loup and the six others, who are more rural. The average disposable income in the RCM of Rimouski being $25,165, this is 20% more than in the RCMs of T√©miscouata ($20,306) and La Matap√©dia ($20,603). = Employment = Even Bas-Saint-Laurent is located at the 13th place among the 17 regions of Quebec in GDP per capita, it sports an unemployment rate of 8.0% in 2011, a figure in decline of 2% compared to the previous year. The share of the workforce in the population is at 58.7% and the employment rate is at 54.1%, a figure which has risen by 0.5% since 2010. This growth can be explained by the reduced share of the population in working age which dropped by 1,400, but as well by a slight growth of 800 new available jobs. The 90,200 employed men and women of the region have only a slight divide in employment rate and nearly a quarter of them (21,800) work in industries producing goods. A study performed in 2009 by the Secor firm notes that the decline of the population under 20 years old combined with the timid growth of the workforce and the drop of the unemployment rate will create a workforce shortage in the coming years. The signs of this new reality in the workforce are already apparent, as Secor notes, taking as an example the thirty programs of professional and technic formations that struggle to recruit enough students. = Primary sector =  Agriculture and food industry  Saint-Louis-du- Ha! Ha! The land area devoted to agriculture in the region covered in 2005, which is around 15.6% of its land area and contributed to more than 6% of its gross domestic product. This industry is mainly located in the plain following the banks of the river and in the foothills of the valleys of T√©miscouata and Matap√©dia. In 2007, the dairy production had the largest share among all regional agricultural productions with 50% of the revenue, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In this industry, a reinforcement of the activities can be observed with a reduction of the number of independent companies but with a global growth of 12% of the milk quotas between 1997 and 2007. The region takes first place in sheep farming, with 32% of all lambs produced in Quebec in 2007. Bas-Saint-Laurent also practices beef cattle farming and pig farming. The maple syrup industry is in growth, as the cuts increased from 3.7 to 6.3 million between 1997 and 2007. The industry producing small fruits like the strawberry, the raspberry, the blueberry is stagnant, and the land area devoted to the growth of cereal grew by 10%, while the one devoted to the market garden industry shrunk.  Forestry industry  The forestry industry of Bas-Saint-Laurent took a hard hit during the American housing market crisis and the ensuing decrease in new projects, as these hit a roof of 500 000 in 2009. Even as new housing projects start to reappear and factories start producing more once again, the industry still continues to turn itself to non traditional markets and tries to sell cunk of resinous wood of smaller diameter  Peat industry  The peat industry of Bas-Saint-Laurent extracts around 45% of the peat production of Quebec and builds specialized transformation tools de tourbe. There are around twenty companies in this industry that employ 1 500 and export 80% of their. Lately, this industry has made a great effort in converging with the agroenvironnemental industry, in fields like biofiltration, composting, agriculture and horticulture Around 2002, a number of initiatives were taken by the producers of the industry and the government of Quebec to develop the industry. The producers managed to perform a life-cycle assessment of the peat and experiment new processes to rehabilitate commercially exploited bogs. = Secondary sector = With the recession caused by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, the wood manufacturing industry, most important manufacturing industry of the region, suffered greatly due to its inability to export in this market, but should recover alongside with the American economy. Some niches, like biomass valorization, might heal this industry, as well as it turning to new markets. Other industries benefit from a favorable economic climate. This is notably the case for Enercon and other companies of the wind industry in Matane and the factory of Bombardier Transportation at La Pocati√®re, which will fulfill an assembly contract of rolling stocks for the cities of Montreal and New York. = Tertiary sector = The tertiary sector of Bas-Saint-Laurent today comprises the majority of the employed population everywhere in the region, but the four main cities of the region, Rimouski, Rivi√®re-du-Loup, La Pocati√®re and Matane, hold the majority of the employment in the sector, and all the regional institutions and infrastructure are mostly located there.  Tourism industry  The administrative region of Bas- Saint-Laurent is divided into two areas of tourism administration and promotion. The six western RCM form the touristic region of Bas-Saint-Laurent, while the RCMs of Matane and La Matap√©dia are part of the touristic region of the Gasp√© Peninsula. Tourism is an important source of seasonal employment in the region, which possesses a few important tourist attraction sites. * Jardins de M√©tis * Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-P√®re * Lac- T√©miscouata National Park * Bic National Park  Transportation  Most of Bas-Saint-Laurent's car traffic transits through three highways: the Autoroute 20, which goes throughout the region west of Mont-Joli, with the exception of a section between L'Isle-Verte and Le Bic, Autoroute 85 and Route 185 passing through T√©miscouata by the north-west of New Brunswick as well as the Route 132, which surrounds Gasp√© Peninsula east of Sainte-Flavie. A fourth important road links Matane and Amqui by following the Matane River. Two road projects are being carried out. The road-work has been ongoing since 2002 with the goal of turning Route 185 into a motorway. The first phase of the project was part of a program aiming to improve road safety and was completed in 2011. The second phase should lengthen the motorway by and should be concluded between the fall of 2013 and 2015. The last phase of the road-work linking Saint- Antonin to Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! with a length of being worked on was authorized by the government in 2011. The third phase is expected by the Minist√®re des Transports, de la Mobilit√© durable et de l'√âlectrification des Transports du Qu√©bec to be completed by 2025.

It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or, locally, as the Cascade Mountains. The latter term is also sometimes used by Washington residents to refer to the Washington section of the Cascades in addition to North Cascades, the more usual U.S. term, as in North Cascades National Park. The highest peak in the range is Mount Rainier in Washington at . part of the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean. All of the eruptions in the contiguous United States over the last 200 years have been from Cascade volcanoes. The two most recent were Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. Minor eruptions of Mount St. Helens have also occurred since, most recently from 2004 to 2008. The Cascade Range is a part of the American Cordillera, a nearly continuous chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that form the western \\"backbone\\" of North America, Central America, and South America.  Geography  Map of the Cascade Range showing major volcanic peaks The Cascades extend northward from Lassen Peak (also known as Mount Lassen) in northern California to the confluence of the Nicola and Thompson rivers in British Columbia. The Fraser River separates the Cascades from the Coast Mountains in Canada, as does the Willamette Valley from the upper portion of the Oregon Coast Range. The highest volcanoes of the Cascades, known as the High Cascades, dominate their surroundings, often standing twice the height of the nearby mountains. They often have a visual height (height above nearby crestlines) of one mile or more. The highest peaks, such as the Mount Rainier, dominate their surroundings for . The northern part of the range, north of Mount Rainier, is known as the North Cascades in the United States but is formally named the Cascade Mountains north of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, reaching to the northern extremity of the Cascades at Lytton Mountain. Overall, the North Cascades and Canadian Cascades are extremely rugged; even the lesser peaks are steep and glaciated, and valleys are quite low relative to peaks and ridges, so there is great local relief. The southern part of the Canadian Cascades, particularly the Skagit Range, is geologically and topographically similar to the North Cascades, while the northern and northeastern parts are less glaciated and more plateau-like, resembling nearby areas of the Thompson Plateau. Because of the range's proximity to the Pacific Ocean and the region's prevailing westerly winds, precipitation is substantial, especially on the western slopes due to orographic lift, with annual snow accumulations of up to in some areas. Mount Baker in Washington recorded a national record single-season snowfall in the winter of 1998‚Äì99 with . Prior to that year, Mount Rainier held the American record for snow accumulation at Paradise in 1978. It is not uncommon for some places in the Cascades to have over of annual snow accumulation, such as at Lake Helen, near Lassen Peak. Most of the High Cascades are therefore white with snow and ice year-round. The western slopes are densely covered with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and red alder (Alnus rubra), while the drier eastern slopes feature mostly ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), with some western larch (Larix occidentalis), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and subalpine larch (Larix lyallii) at higher elevations. Annual rainfall is as low as on the eastern foothills due to a rain shadow effect. The Columbia Gorge marks where the Columbia River splits the Cascade Range between the states of Washington and Oregon. Beyond the eastern foothills is an arid plateau that was largely created 17 to 14 million years ago by the many flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Together, these sequences of fluid volcanic rock form the Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington, Oregon, and parts of western Idaho. The Columbia River Gorge is the only major break of the range in the United States. When the Cascades began to rise 7 million years ago in the Pliocene, the Columbia River drained the relatively low Columbia Plateau. As the range grew, erosion from the Columbia River was able to keep pace, creating the gorge and major pass seen today. The gorge also exposes uplifted and warped layers of basalt from the plateau.  History  Indigenous peoples have inhabited the area for thousands of years and developed their own myths and legends about the Cascades. In these legends, St. Helens with its graceful, pre-1980 appearance was regarded as a beautiful maiden for whom Hood and Adams feuded. Native tribes also developed their own names for the High Cascades and many of the smaller peaks, including \\"Tahoma\\", the Lushootseed name for Mount Rainier, \\"Koma Kulshan\\" or simply \\"Kulshan\\" for Mount Baker, and \\"Louwala-Clough\\", meaning \\"smoking mountain\\" for Mount St. Helens. In early 1792, British navigator George Vancouver explored Puget Sound and gave English names to the high mountains he saw. Mount Baker was named for Vancouver's third lieutenant, Joseph Baker, although the first European to see it was Manuel Quimper, who named it la gran monta√±a del Carmelo (\\"Great Mount Carmel\\") in 1790. Mount Rainier was named after Admiral Peter Rainier. Later in 1792, Vancouver had his lieutenant William Robert Broughton explore the lower Columbia River. He named Mount Hood after Lord Samuel Hood, an admiral of the Royal Navy. Mount St. Helens was sighted by Vancouver in May 1792, from near the mouth of the Columbia River. It was named for Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens, a British diplomat. Vancouver's expedition did not, however, name the mountain range which contained these peaks. He referred to it simply as the \\"eastern snowy range\\". Earlier Spanish explorers called it sierra nevadas, meaning \\"snowy mountains\\". West side view of Mount Shuksan in summer as seen from Artist Point in Washington In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the Cascades on the Columbia River, which for many years was the only practical way to pass that part of the range. They were the first non- indigenous people to see Mount Adams, but they thought it was Mount St. Helens. When they later saw Mount St. Helens they thought it was Mount Rainier. On their return trip, Lewis and Clark spotted a high but distant snowy pinnacle that they named for the sponsor of the expedition, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. Lewis and Clark called the Cascade Range the \\"Western Mountains\\". The Lewis and Clark expedition, and the many settlers and traders that followed, met their last obstacle to their journey at the Cascades Rapids in the Columbia River Gorge, a feature on the river now submerged beneath the Bonneville Reservoir. Before long, the great white- capped mountains that loomed above the rapids were called the \\"mountains by the cascades\\" and later simply as the \\"Cascades\\". The earliest attested use of the name \\"Cascade Range\\" is in the writings of botanist David Douglas. Mount Hood is the tallest point in the U.S. state of Oregon. In 1814, Alexander Ross, a fur trader with the North West Company, seeking a viable route across the mountains, explored and crossed the northern Cascades between Fort Okanogan and Puget Sound. His report of the journey is vague about the route taken. He followed the lower Methow River into the mountains. He might have used Cascade Pass to reach the Skagit River. Ross was the first European- American to explore the Methow River area and likely the first to explore the Stehekin River and Bridge Creek region. Due to the difficulty of crossing the northern Cascades and the paucity of beaver, fur-trading companies made only a few explorations into the mountains north of the Columbia River after Ross. Exploration and settlement of the Cascades region by Europeans and Americans was accelerated by the establishment of a major trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) at Fort Vancouver near today's Portland, Oregon. From this base HBC trapping parties traveled throughout the Cascades in search of beaver and other fur-bearing animals. For example, using what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, Hudson's Bay Company trappers were the first non-natives to explore the southern Cascades in the 1820s and 1830s, establishing trails which passed near Crater Lake, Mount McLoughlin, Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, and Lassen Peak. The Coquihalla River in the Canadian Cascades The course of political history in the Pacific Northwest saw the spine of the Cascade Range being proposed as a boundary settlement during the Oregon Dispute of 1846. The United States rejected the proposal and insisted on the 49th parallel north, which cuts across the range just north of Mount Baker. Throughout the period of dispute and up to the creation of the Crown Colony of British Columbia in 1858, the Hudson's Bay Company's York Factory Express route, as well the route of fur brigades, followed the Okanogan River along the east edge of the Cascades and the Columbia River through the range. Passes across the range were not well known and little used. Naches Pass was used for driving cattle and horses to Fort Nisqually. Yakima Pass was also used by the Hudson's Bay Company. American settlement of the flanks of the Coast Range did not occur until the early 1840s, at first only marginally. Following the Oregon Treaty the inward flux of migration from the Oregon Trail intensified and the passes and back-valleys of what is now the state of Washington were explored and populated, and it was not long after that railways followed. Despite its being traversed by several major freeways and rail lines, and its lower flanks subjected to major logging in recent decades, large parts of the range remain intense and forbidding alpine wilderness. Much of the northern half of the Cascades, from Rainier north, have been preserved by U.S. national or British Columbia provincial parks (such as E.C. Manning Provincial Park), or other forms of protected area. Lassen Peak in the California Cascades. Southernmost volcano in the Cascade Range and part of Lassen Volcanic National Park The Canadian side of the range has a history that includes the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858‚Äì60 and its famous Cariboo Road, as well as the older Hudson's Bay Company Brigade Trail from the Canyon to the Interior, the Dewdney Trail, and older routes which connected east to the Similkameen and Okanagan valleys. The southern mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway penetrated the range via the passes of the Coquihalla River, along one of the steepest and snowiest routes in the entire Pacific Cordillera. Near Hope, B.C., the railway roadbed and the Othello Tunnels, now decommissioned, are popular tourist recreation destinations for hiking and bicycling. The pass is used by the Coquihalla Highway, a government megaproject built as part of the Expo 86 spending boom of the 1980s, which is now the main route from the Coast to the British Columbia interior. Traffic formerly went via the Fraser Canyon, to the west, or via Allison Pass and Manning Park along Highway 3 to the south, near the border. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens The Barlow Road was the first established land path for U.S. settlers through the Cascade Range in 1845, and formed the final overland link for the Oregon Trail (previously, settlers had to raft down the treacherous rapids of the Columbia River). The Road left the Columbia at what is now Hood River and passed along the south side of Mount Hood at what is now Government Camp, terminating in Oregon City. There is an interpretive site there now at \\"The End of The Oregon Trail\\". The road was constructed as a toll road ‚Äì $5 per wagon ‚Äì and was very successful. In addition, the Applegate Trail was created to allow settlers to avoid rafting down the Columbia River. The Trail used the path of the California Trail to north-central Nevada. From there, the Trail headed northwest into northern California, and continued northwest towards today's Ashland, Oregon. From there, settlers would head north along the established Siskiyou Trail into the Willamette Valley. With the exception of the 1915 eruption of remote Lassen Peak in Northern California, the range was quiet for more than a century. Then, on May 18, 1980, the dramatic eruption of Mount St. Helens shattered the quiet and brought the world's attention to the range. Geologists were also concerned that the St. Helens eruption was a sign that long-dormant Cascade volcanoes might become active once more, as in the period from 1800 to 1857 when a total of eight erupted. None have erupted since St. Helens, but precautions are being taken nevertheless, such as the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System in Pierce County, Washington. Geology Geology of the Cascade Range-related plate tectonics. The Cascade Range is made up of a band of thousands of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes, like Mount St. Helens, that dominate the landscape. The Cascade volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is also known for its frequent earthquakes. The volcanoes and earthquakes arise from a common source: subduction, where the dense Juan de Fuca oceanic plate plunges beneath the North American Plate. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Volcanic Arc) above the subduction zone. Human uses Soil conditions for farming are generally good, especially downwind of volcanoes. This is largely because volcanic rocks are often rich in potassium bearing minerals such as orthoclase and decay easily. Volcanic debris, especially lahars, also have a leveling effect and the storage of water in the form of snow and ice is also important. These snow-capped mountains such as Mt. Hood and Mt. Bachelor are used as ski resorts in the late winter. Much of that water eventually flows into reservoirs, where it is used for recreation before its potential energy is captured to generate hydroelectric power before being used to irrigate crops. Because of the abundance of powerful streams, many of the major westward rivers off the Cascades have been dammed to provide hydroelectric power. One of these, Ross Dam on the Skagit River, created a reservoir which spans the border southeast of Hope, British Columbia, extending into Canada. At the foot of the southeast flank of Mount Baker, at Concrete, Washington, the Baker River is dammed to form Lake Shannon and Baker Lake. In addition, there is a largely untapped amount of geothermal power that can be generated from the Cascades. The U.S. Geological Survey Geothermal Research Program has been investigating this potential. Some of this energy is already being used in places like Klamath Falls, Oregon, where volcanic steam is used to heat public buildings. The highest recorded temperature found in the range is at below Newberry Volcano's caldera floor. Ecology Oval-leaf blueberry on Mount Pilchuck Forests of large, coniferous trees (western red cedars, Douglas-firs, western hemlocks, firs, pines, spruces, and others) dominate most of the Cascade Range. Cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers (largely a result of oceanic influence) favor evergreen species, whereas mild temperatures and rich soils promote fast and prolonged growth. Mountain goat on Wallaby Peak in the North Cascades As a traveler passes through the Cascade Range, the climate first gets colder, then warmer and drier east of the crest. Most of the Cascades' lower and middle elevations are covered in coniferous forest; the higher altitudes have extensive meadows as well as alpine tundra and glaciers. The southern part of the Cascades are within the California Floristic Province, an area of high biodiversity. Black bears, coyotes, bobcats, cougars, beavers, deer, elk, moose, mountain goats and a few wolf packs returning from Canada live in the Cascades. Fewer than 50 grizzly bears reside in the Cascades of Canada and Washington.

It is composed of the Germanic elements arn \\"eagle\\" and ulf \\"wolf\\". The -ulf, -olf suffix was an extremely frequent element in Germanic onomastics and from an early time was perceived as a mere suffix forming given names. Similarly, the suffix -wald, -ald, -old, originally from wald \\"rule, power\\" underwent semantic weakening. Therefore, the name Arnulf and Arnold were often conflated in early medieval records, as is the case with bishop Arnulf of Metz (died 640), especially as the final consonant came to be dropped (Arnoul). The name Arnulf is attested from as early as the 5th century, as the name of the brother of Odoacer. The name is attested with some frequency in Medieval Germany throughout the 8th to 11th centuries, in the spelling variants Arnulf, Arnulph, Arnolf, occasionally also as Arenulph, Harnulf, Harnolf, Harnolph. In the 9th century, Arnulf of Carinthia was the ruler of East Francia and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 896. There was an Anglo-Saxon cognate, Earnulf (Ernulf), which was assimilated to the Frankish form of the name after the Norman conquest. Arnulf of Eynesbury is an obscure 9th-century English saint, who was mostly forgotten by the 11th century, and who was perhaps just a folkloristic duplicate of the historical Arnulf of Metz. In any case, the English Arnulf would have been known as Earnulf, and his relics were venerated in Earnulfesbyrig (Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire). The name is also attested in medieval Scandinavia, as Old Norse Arn√∫lfr (√Ürnulfr, «™rn√≥lfr, «™rnulfr, Old Swedish √Ürinolf, √Ürnolf, √Ñrnulf).nordicnames.de, citing Lena Peterson, Nordiskt runnamnslexikon (2002). Scandinavian dialectal and regional variants of the name include Annul, Annulv, Anul, Arnolv, Arnulv, √ñrn√≥lfur, √òrnolvur, √ñrnulf, √òrnulf, √òrnulv.

It is likely that he joined the campaign against the \\"Moriscos\\" in the Alpujarra in 1560. Guerras civiles de Granada He owes his wide celebrity to the Historia de los bandos de los Zegr√≠es y Abencerrajes (1595‚Äì1619), better known as the Guerras civiles de Granada, which purports to be a chronicle based on an Arabic original ascribed to a certain Aben-Hamin. Abed-Hamin is a fictitious character, and the \\"Wars of Granada\\" is, in reality, a historical novel, perhaps the earliest example of its kind, and certainly the first historical novel that attained popularity. In the first part, the events which led to the downfall of Granada are related with uncommon brilliancy, and P√©rez de Hita's sympathetic transcription of life at the Emir's court has clearly suggested the conventional presentation of the picturesque, chivalrous Moor in the pages of Mlle de Scud√©ry, Mme de Lafayette, Ch√¢teaubriand and Washington Irving. The second part is concerned with the author's personal experiences and the treatment is effective; yet, though Calder√≥n's play, Amar despu√©s de la muerte, is derived from it, this less picturesque second part has never enjoyed the vogue or influence of the first.

The result is lower induced drag on the aircraft. This is caused primarily by the ground or water obstructing the creation of wingtip vortices and interrupting downwash behind the wing.Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators. RAMESH TAAL, HOSUR, VIC. Australia: Aviation Theory Centre, 2005.Pilot's Encyclopedia of Aeronautical Knowledge 2007, pp. 3-7, 3-8. A wing generates lift by deflecting the oncoming airmass (relative wind) downward.\\"Lift from Flow Turning\\". NASA Glenn Research Center. Retrieved July 7, 2009. The deflected or \\"turned\\" flow of air creates a resultant force on the wing in the opposite direction (Newton's 3rd law). The resultant force is identified as lift. Flying close to a surface increases air pressure on the lower wing surface, nicknamed the \\"ram\\" or \\"cushion\\" effect, and thereby improves the aircraft lift-to-drag ratio. The lower/nearer the wing is with regards to the ground, the more pronounced the ground effect becomes. While in the ground effect, the wing requires a lower angle of attack to produce the same amount of lift. In wind tunnel tests in which the angle of attack and airspeed remain constant, an increase in the lift coefficient ensues,Dole 2000, pp. 3‚Äì8. which accounts for the \\"floating\\" effect. Ground effect also alters thrust versus velocity, where reduced induced drag requires less thrust in order to maintain the same velocity. Low winged aircraft are more affected by ground effect than high wing aircraft.Flight theory and aerodynamics, p. 70 Due to the change in up-wash, down-wash, and wingtip vortices there may be errors in the airspeed system while in ground effect due to changes in the local pressure at the static source. Rotorcraft When a hovering rotor is near the ground the downward flow of air through the rotor is reduced to zero at the ground. This condition is transferred up to the disc through pressure changes in the wake which decreases the inflow to the rotor for a given disk loading, which is rotor thrust for each square foot of its area. This gives a thrust increase for a particular blade pitch angle. Or, alternatively, the power required for a thrust is reduced. For an overloaded helicopter that can only hover IGE it may be possible to climb away from the ground by translating to forward flight first while in ground effect.https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA002007 3-2.1.1.8 The ground effect benefit disappears rapidly with speed but the induced power decreases rapidly as well to allow a safe climb.https://www.abbottaerospace.com/downloads/agard-r-781/, p.2-6 Some early underpowered helicopters could only hover close to the ground.Basic Helicopter Aerodynamics, J. Seddon 1990, , p.21 Ground effect is at its maximum over a firm, smooth surface.https://rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov/faa-h-8083-21.pdf p.3-4 VTOL aircraft There are two effects inherent to VTOL aircraft operating at zero and low speeds IGE, suckdown and fountain lift. A third, HGI, may also apply to fixed-wing aircraft on the ground in windy conditions or during thrust reverser operation. How well, in terms of weight lifted, a VTOL aircraft hovers IGE depends on suckdown on the airframe, fountain impingement on the underside of the fuselage and HGI into the engine. Suckdown works against the engine lift as a downward force on the airframe. Fountain flow works with the engine lift jets as an upwards force. HGI reduces the thrust generated by the engine. Suckdown is the result of entrainment of air around aircraft by lift jets when hovering. It also occurs in free air (OGE) causing loss of lift by reducing pressures on the underside of the fuselage and wings. Enhanced entrainment occurs when close to the ground giving higher lift loss. Fountain lift occurs when an aircraft has two or more lift jets. The jets strike the ground and spread out. Where they meet under the fuselage they mix and can only move upwards striking the underside of the fuselage.https://soaneemrana.org/onewebmedia/AIRCRAFT%20DESIGN%20%3B%20A%20Conceptual%20Approach%20BY%20DANIEL%20P%20RAYMER.pdf , p.551,552 How well their upward momentum is diverted sideways or downward determines the lift. Fountain flow follows a curved fuselage underbody and retains some momentum in an upward direction so less than full fountain lift is captured unless Lift Improvement Devices are fitted.https://www.ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19870014977&qs;=t%3D0%26N%3D4294955891%2B4294904888%2B4294965980, p.4 HGI reduces engine thrust because the air entering the engine is hotter than ambient. Early VTOL experimental aircraft operated from open grids to channel away the engine exhaust and prevent thrust loss from HGI. The Bell X-14, built to research early VTOL technology, was unable to hover until suckdown effects were reduced by raising the aircraft with longer landing gear legs.The X-Planes, Jay Miller1988, , p.108 It also had to operate from an elevated platform of perforated steel to reduce HGI.https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Application-of-powered-high-lift- systems-to-STOL-Ameel/d77cdbba3fea3a81678bb76f9070ac2ee546bd55, p.14 The Dassault Mirage IIIV VTOL research aircraft only ever operated vertically from a grid which allowed engine exhaust to be channelled away from the aircraft to avoid suckdown and HGI effects.https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/5869200, p.4 Ventral strakes retroactively fitted to the P.1127 improved flow and increased pressure under the belly in low altitude hovering. Gun pods fitted in the same position did the same thing. Further lift improvement devices (LIDS) were developed for the AV-8B and Harrier II. To box in the belly region where the lift-enhancing fountains strike the aircraft strakes were added to the underside of the gun pods and a hinged dam could be lowered to block the gap between the front ends of the strakes.

Origins He was the second son of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick (1559-1619) by his first wife Penelope Devereux. His elder brother was Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick (1587‚Äì1658). Career He began his career as a courtier and soldier in 1610, a year he took part as a volunteer in an English regiment at the Siege of Julich, swiftly becoming a favourite of King James I, but fell out of favour on the accession of Charles I. He was created Baron Kensington in 1622, and Earl of Holland in 1624. He was one of the many lovers of Marie de Rohan, the veteran of French court intrigue. Rich fought a duel in April 1619 with a younger brother of Sir John Eyre but neither were hurt. The next day Rich joined his father's funeral procession from London to Essex.Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 227. =Public Offices= He was elected a Member of Parliament for Leicester in 1610 and was re-elected in 1614, having failed to be elected for the prestigious county seat of Norfolk. He was appointed joint Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire for 1628‚Äì1632 and sole Lieutenant of that county for 1632‚Äì1643. He was also joint Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex for 1628‚Äì1642 and sole Lieutenant for 1642‚Äì1643. He served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1617 to 1632, Master of the Horse in 1628, Constable of Windsor Castle from 1628 to 1648 and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 1628 until his death. =Military career= The 1st Earl of Holland After his initial campaign service at Julich, Rich saw further active service in the Netherlands in 1621, and as commander in chief of the unsuccessful English relief force at the Siege of La Rochelle in 1627. In peacetime, he was governor of Harwich in 1628, appointed General of Horse in 1639 and Captain- General and commander-in-chief of the militia in the North of England in 1641. However after the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 he initially sided with Parliament but saw no active service with them. In 1643 he defected to the Royalists, leaving Westminster for Oxford where they received him 'with indifference'. He promptly returned to Westminster where the House of Lords refused to admit him. After the king surrendered with the end of the first Civil War in 1646, Holland took part in mediations between the king and Parliament to seek a compromise settlement. When these failed, he openly re- sided with the king who appointed him General of the royalist army when Civil War resumed in 1648, against the parliamentary New Model Army. On Sunday 9 July 1648, the Earl and his army of approximately 400 men entered St Neots in Huntingdonshire. The Earl's men were hungry and weary, following their escape from Kingston upon Thames, where the Parliamentary forces had completely overwhelmed them. Of his original army of 500, the Earl escaped with about 100 cavalry and was immediately followed by a small party of Puritan and Parliamentary cavalry. After much hesitation concerning which direction they should flee to, the Earl decided on Northampton, whither the group made their way via St Albans and Dunstable. At the outskirts of Bedford the group turned eastward towards the town of St Neots. At Kingston, the Earl was joined by the young George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, his young brother Francis Villiers and Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough. They were also joined by Colonel John Dalbier, an experienced German soldier who was hated by the Roundheads, having previously served with them under the Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex until he defected to the Royalist side. The field officers of Holland's force sought only rest and safety. Colonel Dalbier called a council of war, at which many officers voted to disperse into the surrounding countryside. Others suggested they should continue northwards. Colonel Dalbier advised on the strategic position of St Neots and the fact that the joint remnants of the forces of Buckingham and Holland had increased sufficiently since the retreat from the Roundheads at Kingston. He suggested they should meet and engage their pursuers. He further added that, by obtaining a victory, the fortunes of war could be turned in their favour. Due to his vast experience as a soldier, his words were listened to with respect. He further offered to guard them through the night in case of a surprise attack, or to meet a soldier's death in the defence of the town. A vote was taken and Dalbier's plan was adopted. The Earl of Holland, who it was said \\"had better faculty at public address than he had with a sword\\", joined Buckingham and Peterborough in addressing the principal residents and townsfolk of St Neots. The Duke of Buckingham spoke at length, claiming \\"they did not wish to continue a bloody war, but wanted only a settled government under Royal King Charles\\". Assurances were also given that their Royalist troop would not riot or damage the townfolks‚Äô property. On the latter promise it is recorded that they were faithful to their word. Fatigued by their battle and consequent retreat from Kingston, the field officers eagerly sought rest. True to his word, Colonel Dalbier kept watch over them. The small group of Puritan horsemen who had pursued them had, upon reaching Hertford, met with Colonel Adrian Scrope and his Roundhead troops from their detachment at Colchester. =Battle of St Neots= At two o‚Äôclock on Monday morning, 10 July, 100 Dragoons from the Parliamentary forces arrived ahead of the main army at Eaton Ford. Dalbier was at once informed, and immediately gave the alarm: \\"To horse, to horse!\\" The Dragoons, equipped with musket and sword, crossed St Neots‚Äô Bridge before the Royalists were fully prepared. The Battle of St Neots had begun. The few Royalists guarding the bridge quickly fell back from the superior numbers before them. The ensuing battle was now fought on the main square and streets of the town. The remaining Royalists were now fully prepared for combat. The main army of Roundheads had also arrived, and a further wave of Puritans crossed the bridge into town. The battle was fierce, with the Puritans gaining ground. Colonel Dalbier died during the early stages of the battle. Other prominent Royalists, including Buckingham's younger brother Francis Villiers, and Kenelm Digby (son of the scientific writer of the same name), were also killed during the battle. Other officers and men drowned whilst attempting to escape by crossing the River Ouse. The young Duke of Buckingham, being overwhelmed by the speed of these events, escaped with 60 horsemen to Huntingdon, with the intention of continuing towards Lincolnshire. Upon realising the Roundheads were in hot pursuit, he changed plans, and via an evasive route returned to London from where he later escaped to France. The Earl of Holland with his personal guard fought their way to the inn at which he had stayed the previous night. The gates had been closed and locked, but were quickly opened to admit him, and immediately closed again as he entered. The Parliamentarians soon battered them down and entered the inn. The door of the Earl's room was burst open to reveal him facing them, sword in hand. It is recorded that he offered surrender of himself, his army and the town of St Neots, on condition that his life was spared. The Puritans seized the Earl and took him before Colonel Scroope, who ordered him to be shackled and imprisoned under guard. The remaining Royalist prisoners were locked in St Neots parish church overnight, then taken to Hitchin the following morning. The Earl and five other field officers were taken to Warwick Castle, which had remained a parliamentary stronghold throughout the war. They remained prisoners for the next six months, until their trial for high treason. In London it was said \\"His Lordship may spend time as well as he can and have leisure to repent his juvenile folly.\\" Peterborough also escaped disguised as a gentleman merchant, but was later recognised and arrested. Friends aided their escape again whilst en route to London for trial. He then stayed at various safe houses, financed by his mother, until he managed to flee the country. The second rising of the English Civil War had culminated in the Battle of Preston during August 1648, with the Roundheads marching 250 miles in 26 days through foul weather and conditions, to defeat and ensure the Royalists would never re-form as an army. Trial and execution On 27 February 1649, the Earl of Holland was moved to London for trial. He pleaded his crime was not capital, and claimed that he had surrendered St Neots town on the condition that his life would be spared. It was stated at the time that in 1643, Lord Holland had been loyal to Parliament, but decided to change sides later that year and join the Royalists. He was with the King's forces at the Battle of Chalgrove, but stole away during a dark night before the close of battle. On 3 March, the Earl was condemned as a traitor and sentenced to death. His brother, the Earl of Warwick, and sister-in-law the Countess of Warwick, petitioned Parliament for his life, as did other ladies of rank. The Puritan Parliament divided its vote equally. The speaker gave the casting vote for the sentence to stand. The petition had succeeded only in deferring the execution for two days. The Earl was dangerously ill during this period, and neither ate nor slept. On the morning of his execution, 9 March, before Westminster Hall, the Earl walked unaided, but spoke to people along the way, declaring his surrender at St Neots was on condition that his life would be spared. At the scaffold he prayed, then gave the executioner his forgiveness and what money he still had on his person, which was approximately ten pounds. Upon laying his head on the block, he signalled the executioner by stretching his arms outwards. His head was severed in one stroke by the executioner's axe. Very little blood flowed, due to his weakness; the prevailing feeling was that, even had the execution not taken place, he probably would not have lived for very long anyhow. He was aged 58. Marriage and children Holland House, 1896 In 1616 the Earl married Isabel Cope, daughter, only child and sole heiress of Sir Walter Cope (c. 1553‚Äì1614) of Cope Castle in the parish of Kensington, Middlesex, by his wife Dorothy Grenville (1563‚Äì1638). Having inherited Cope Castle by marriage, Rich changed its name to Holland House, having been raised to the peerage as Baron Kensington in 1622, and Earl of Holland in 1624. By his wife he had at least six children, including: =Sons= *Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Holland, 5th Earl of Warwick (c. 1619 ‚Äì 16 April 1675), eldest son and heir, who married firstly Lady Anne Montagu, his second cousin, daughter of Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester; secondly, in 1641, Elizabeth Ingram, a daughter of Sir Arthur Ingram the younger of Temple Newsam, Yorkshire and his first wife Eleanor Slingsby.

At an elevation of , it is the second-highest peak in the Cascades and the fifth-highest in the state. Mount Shasta has an estimated volume of , which makes it the most voluminous stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. The mountain and surrounding area are part of the Shasta‚ÄìTrinity National Forest.  Description  Mount Shasta is connected to its satellite cone of Shastina, and together they dominate the landscape. Shasta rises abruptly to tower nearly above its surroundings. On a clear winter day, the mountain can be seen from the floor of the Central Valley to the south.In 1878 the Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulated between heliotropes atop Mount Shasta and Mount St. Helena, south. The mountain has attracted the attention of poets, authors, and presidents. The mountain consists of four overlapping dormant volcanic cones that have built a complex shape, including the main summit and the prominent satellite cone of Shastina, which has a visibly conical form. If Shastina were a separate mountain, it would rank as the fourth-highest peak of the Cascade Range (after Mount Rainier, Rainier's Liberty Cap, and Mount Shasta itself). Mount Shasta's surface is relatively free of deep glacial erosion except, paradoxically, for its south side where Sargents Ridge runs parallel to the U-shaped Avalanche Gulch. This is the largest glacial valley on the volcano, although it does not now have a glacier in it. There are seven named glaciers on Mount Shasta, with the four largest (Whitney, Bolam, Hotlum, and Wintun) radiating down from high on the main summit cone to below primarily on the north and east sides. The Whitney Glacier is the longest, and the Hotlum is the most voluminous glacier in the state of California. Three of the smaller named glaciers occupy cirques near and above on the south and southeast sides, including the Watkins, Konwakiton, and Mud Creek glaciers.  History  The oldest-known human settlement in the area dates to about 7,000 years ago. At the time of Euro- American contact in the 1820s, the Native American tribes who lived within view of Mount Shasta included the Shasta, Okwanuchu, Modoc, Achomawi, Atsugewi, Karuk, Klamath, Wintu, and Yana tribes. A historic eruption of Mount Shasta in 1786 may have been observed by Lap√©rouse, but this is disputed. Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program says that the 1786 eruption is discredited, and that the last known eruption of Mount Shasta was around 1250 AD, proved by uncorrected radiocarbon dating. Although perhaps first seen by Spanish explorers, the first reliably reported land sighting of Mount Shasta by a European or American was by Peter Skene Ogden (a leader of a Hudson's Bay Company trapping brigade) in 1826. In 1827, the name \\"Sasty\\" or \\"Sastise\\" was given to nearby Mount McLoughlin by Ogden. An 1839 map by David Burr lists the mountain as Rogers Peak. This name was apparently dropped, and the name Shasta was transferred to present-day Mount Shasta in 1841, partly as a result of work by the United States Exploring Expedition. Mount Shasta seen from south of Weed, California Beginning in the 1820s, Mount Shasta was a prominent landmark along what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, which runs at Mount Shasta's base. The Siskiyou Trail was on the track of an ancient trade and travel route of Native American footpaths between California's Central Valley and the Pacific Northwest. The California Gold Rush brought the first Euro-American settlements into the area in the early 1850s, including at Yreka, California and Upper Soda Springs. The first recorded ascent of Mount Shasta occurred in 1854 (by Elias Pearce), after several earlier failed attempts. In 1856, the first women (Harriette Eddy, Mary Campbell McCloud, and their party) reached the summit. The Shasta Courier reprints from its files of 1856. Clarence King exploring the Whitney Glacier in 1870 By the 1860s and 1870s, Mount Shasta was the subject of scientific and literary interest. In 1854 John Rollin Ridge titled a poem \\"Mount Shasta.\\" A book by California pioneer and entrepreneur James Hutchings, titled Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California, contained an account of an early summit trip in 1855. The summit was achieved (or nearly so) by John Muir, Josiah Whitney, Clarence King, and John Wesley Powell. In 1877, Muir wrote a dramatic popular article about his surviving an overnight blizzard on Mount Shasta by lying in the hot sulfur springs near the summit. This experience was inspiration to Kim Stanley Robinson's short story \\"Muir on Shasta\\". The 1887 completion of the Central Pacific Railroad, built along the line of the Siskiyou Trail between California and Oregon, brought a substantial increase in tourism, lumbering, and population into the area around Mount Shasta. Early resorts and hotels, such as Shasta Springs and Upper Soda Springs, grew up along the Siskiyou Trail around Mount Shasta, catering to these early adventuresome tourists and mountaineers. In the early 20th century, the Pacific Highway followed the track of the Siskiyou Trail to the base of Mount Shasta, leading to still more access to the mountain. Today's version of the Siskiyou Trail, Interstate 5, brings thousands of people each year to Mount Shasta. From February 13‚Äì19, 1959, the Mount Shasta Ski Bowl obtained the record for the most snowfall during one storm in the U.S., with a total of . Mount Shasta was declared a National Natural Landmark in December 1976. = Legends = Sunrise on Mount Shasta The lore of some of the Klamath Tribes in the area held that Mount Shasta is inhabited by the Spirit of the Above-World, Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain's summit at the request of a Klamath chief. Skell fought with Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at Mount Mazama by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains. Italian settlers arrived in the early 1900s to work in the mills as stonemasons and established a strong Catholic presence in the area. Many other faiths have been attracted to Mount Shasta over the years‚Äîmore than any other Cascade volcano. Mount Shasta City and Dunsmuir, California, small towns near Shasta's western base, are focal points for many of these, which range from a Buddhist monastery (Shasta Abbey, founded by Houn Jiyu-Kennett in 1971) to modern-day Native American rituals. A group of Native Americans from the McCloud River area practice rituals on the mountain. Mount Shasta has also been a focus for non-Native American legends, centered on a hidden city of advanced beings from the lost continent of Lemuria. The legend grew from an offhand mention of Lemuria in the 1880s, to a description of a hidden Lemurian village in 1925. In 1931, Harvey Spencer Lewis, using the pseudonym Wisar Spenle Cerve, wrote Lemuria: the lost continent of the Pacific, published by the Rosicrucians, about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta that cemented the legend in many readers' minds. In August 1987, believers in the spiritual significance of the Harmonic Convergence described Mount Shasta as one of a small number of global \\"power centers\\". Mount Shasta remains a focus of \\"New Age\\" attention.  Geology  2016 60 cm orthophoto mosaic overlaid on 3 m slope map (derived from digital elevation model). Scale 1:50,000. About 593,000 years ago, andesitic lavas erupted in what is now Mount Shasta's western flank near McBride Spring. Over time, an ancestral Mount Shasta stratovolcano was built to a large but unknown height; sometime between 300,000 and 360,000 years ago the entire north side of the volcano collapsed, creating an enormous landslide or debris avalanche, in volume. The slide flowed northwestward into Shasta Valley, where the Shasta River now cuts through the flow. What remains of the oldest of Mount Shasta's four cones is exposed at Sargents Ridge on the south side of the mountain. Lavas from the Sargents Ridge vent cover the Everitt Hill shield at Mount Shasta's southern foot. The last lavas to erupt from the vent were hornblende-pyroxene andesites with a hornblende dacite dome at its summit. Glacial erosion has since modified its shape. The next cone to form is exposed south of Mount Shasta's current summit and is called Misery Hill. It was formed 15,000 to 20,000 years ago from pyroxene andesite flows and has since been intruded by a hornblende dacite dome. Black Butte, seen from Weed, California There are many buried glacial scars on the mountain which were created in recent glacial periods (\\"ice ages\\") of the present Wisconsinian glaciation. Most have since been filled in with andesite lava, pyroclastic flows, and talus from lava domes. Shastina, by comparison, has a fully intact summit crater indicating Shastina developed after the last ice age. Shastina has been built by mostly pyroxene andesite lava flows. Some 9,500 years ago, these flows reached about south and north of the area now occupied by nearby Black Butte. The last eruptions formed Shastina's present summit about a hundred years later. But before that, Shastina, along with the then forming Black Butte dacite plug dome complex to the west, created numerous pyroclastic flows that covered , including large parts of what is now Mount Shasta, California and Weed, California. Diller Canyon ( deep and wide) is an avalanche chute that was probably carved into Shastina's western face by these flows. The last to form, and the highest cone, the Hotlum Cone, formed about 8,000 years ago. It is named after the Hotlum glacier on its northern face; its longest lava flow, the Military Pass flow, extends down its northeast face. Since the creation of the Hotlum Cone, a dacite dome intruded the cone and now forms the summit. The rock at the summit crater has been extensively hydrothermally altered by sulfurous hot springs and fumaroles there (only a few examples still remain). In the last 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted at least eight or nine times. About 200 years ago the last significant Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a hot lahar (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek. A separate hot lahar went down Mud Creek. This eruption was thought to have been observed by the explorer La P√©rouse, from his ship off the California coast, in 1786, but this has been disputed. = Volcanic status = During the last 10,000 years, Mount Shasta has erupted an average of every 800 years, but in the past 4,500 years the volcano has erupted an average of every 600 years. The last significant eruption on Mount Shasta may have occurred about two centuries ago. Diller Canyon on Shastina from Weed USGS seismometers and GPS receivers operated by UNAVCO form the monitoring network for Mount Shasta. The volcano has been relatively quiet for at least the past 15 years, with only a handful of small magnitude earthquakes and no demonstrable ground deformation. Although geophysically quiet, periodic geochemical surveys indicate that volcanic gas emanates from a fumarole at the summit of Mount Shasta from a deep-seated reservoir of partly molten rock.https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20185159California‚Äôs Exposure to Volcanic Hazards Scientific Investigations Report 2018-5159 Prepared in cooperation with the California Governor‚Äôs Office of Emergency Services and the California Geological Surve Mount Shasta's west face as seen from Hidden Valley high on the mountain. The west face gulley is an alternate climbing route to the summit. Mount Shasta can release volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows or dacite and andesite lava. Its deposits can be detected under nearby small towns. Mount Shasta has an explosive, eruptive history. There are fumaroles on the mountain, which show Mount Shasta is still alive. The worst-case scenario for an eruption is a large pyroclastic flow, similar to that which occurred in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Since there is ice, such as Whitney Glacier and Mud Creek Glacier, lahars would also result. Ash would probably blow inland, perhaps as far as eastern Nevada. There is a small chance an eruption could result in a collapse of the mountain, as happened when Mount Mazama in Oregon collapsed to form what is now called Crater Lake, but this is of much lower probability. The United States Geological Survey monitors Mount Shasta and rates it as a very high-threat volcano.  Climbing  Mount Shasta's west face, June 2009 The summer climbing season runs from late April until October, although many attempts are made in the winter. In winter, Sargents Ridge and Casaval Ridge, to the east and west of Avalanche Gulch, respectively, become the most traveled routes, to avoid avalanche danger. Mount Shasta is also a popular destination for backcountry skiing. Many of the climbing routes can be descended by experienced skiers, and there are numerous lower-angled areas around the base of the mountain. The most popular route on Mount Shasta is Avalanche Gulch route, which begins at the Bunny Flat Trailhead and gains about of elevation in approximately round trip. The crux of this route is considered to be to climb from Lake Helen, at approximately , to the top of Red Banks. The Red Banks are the most technical portion of the climb, as they are usually full of snow/ice, are very steep, and top out at around before the route heads to Misery Hill. The Casaval Ridge route is a steeper, more technical route on the mountain's southwest ridge best climbed when there's a lot of snow pack. This route tops out to the left (north) of the Red Banks, directly west of Misery Hill. So the final sections involve a trudge up Misery Hill to the summit plateau, similar to the Avalanche Gulch route. No quota system currently exists for climbing Mount Shasta, and reservations are not required. However, climbers must obtain a summit pass and a wilderness permit to climb the mountain. Permits and passes are available at the ranger station in Mount Shasta and the ranger station in McCloud, or climbers can obtain self-issue permits and passes at any of the trailheads 24 hours a day. Climbing Mt. Shasta can be done in one day, however, it is often completed in 2 days. Climbers can ascend from Avalanche Gulch and camp at either Horse Camp (elev. 7,900) or Helen Lake (elev. 10,400). Camping at a higher altitude also helps with acclimatization and often reduces risk of altitude sickness.

He was the eldest son of Louis the German, king of East Francia, and Hemma, daughter of a Bavarian count. His father appointed him governor of Carantania in 856, and commander of southeastern frontier marches in 864. Upon his father's death in 876 he became King of Bavaria. He was appointed by King Louis II of Italy as his successor, but the Kingdom of Italy was taken by his uncle Charles the Bald in 875. Carloman only conquered it in 877. In 879 he was incapacitated, perhaps by a stroke, and abdicated his domains in favour of his younger brothers: Bavaria to Louis the Younger and Italy to Charles the Fat. Early life Carloman's birth date is unknown, but was probably around 828 or 830. His naming can be connected to his father's push to rule Alemannia around the time of his father's assembly of Worms in 829. The first member of the Carolingian dynasty named Carloman had ruled Alemannia in 741‚Äì48, and subjugated it to the Franks. Carloman was old enough to participate in the civil war of 840‚Äì43, waged between his father and his uncles, Lothair and Charles the Bald. His first record public appearance is as the leader of an army of reinforcements from Bavaria and Alemannia which he brought to his father at Worms in 842. He subsequently led them in battle alongside his father and uncle (Charles the Bald) against his other uncle (Lothair). It was the beginning of a warlike career. Notker of Saint Gall, who bewailed the decline of the dynasty a generation later, called Carloman bellicosissimus (literally \\"most warlike\\", or in historian Eric Goldberg's words a \\"real ass- kicker\\"). In October 848, Carloman was present at his father's council in Regensburg, where the Slavic commander (dux) Pribina was rewarded for his service in defending the Bavarian frontier. In the charter confirming the grant, Carloman signed his name first among the secular magnates (after the ecclesiastics). In the 840s, Carloman had a liaison with Liutswind, daughter of the Bavarian count Ratolt and sister-in-law of Count Sigihard of the Kraichgau. This was Carloman's first politically independent action, and it confirms his close connexion to Bavaria. Around 850, Liutswind bore him a son, Arnulf. This name was chosen because it was distinctly dynastic (the founder of the Carolingian family was Bishop Arnulf of Metz), yet had never been used by a reigning king and was thus appropriate for an illegitimate eldest son. The choice of the name is the surest evidence that Liutswind and Carloman were not legally married. Around 860, Arnulf and his cousin, Hugh, the illegitimate son of Carloman's brother Louis, were both in Koblenz at the court of their grandfather, who was probably overseeing their military education and also holding them to ensure the good behaviour of their fathers. Guardian of the southeastern frontiers Carantania and eastern regions in the second half of the 9th century In 856, Louis first associated Carloman with his rule by appointing him governor of Carantania. According to the Annales Fuldenses (863), he was given the title \\"prelate of the Carantanians\\" (). Since this was his first governorship, Louis did not give him rule over the entire March of Pannonia, with traditional seat of frontier governor (prefect) at Tulln. Instead, Carloman was given rule over the inner region (Carantania), in order do gain experience, and perhaps because his father wanted to keep him from trying to seize to much power. Gaining the first foothold of power in Carantania, Carloman moved to assume more prominent role in governorship over the frontier regions of his father‚Ä≤s realm. Starting from 857, Carloman was occasional witnesses to his father's charters, and already in 858 he was appointed to lead a military expedition against the Great Moravia. In 861, Carloman came into conflict with several frontier commanders in southeastern regions, expelled them from their offices, and replaced them with his loyals. That move was made without his fathers consent, and by 862 an open conflict erupted, with Carloman siding with Rastislav of Moravia and taking control over all southeastern regions, advancing further into Bavaria, up to the river Inn. An attempted reconciliation and truce between father and son failed, and in 863 king Louis invaded his sons territory, forced Carloman into submission, and took him into custody. Replaced by count Gundachar, who was appointed governor of eastern marches by king Louis (863), prince Carloman remained in his father custody until 864, when he escaped and returned to Carantania. Welcomed by supporters, he assumed power in the province. At that time, king Louis was campaigning against Moravia, but ceased further operations and moved south, towards Carantania. Conflict was avoided by reconciliation. Father and son met and reached an agreement. Carloman submitted to his father and in return he was granted governorship over eastern marches. Carloman's letter to his father from 869 survives, describing conditions on the frontier. In 870, he succeeded in establishing Frankish domination over Great Moravia, through arrangement with Svatopluk, who captured his uncle Rastislav of Moravia, ruling prince of Moravia, and gave him over to Carloman. During the following Frankish invasion, Moravian archbishop Methodius was also captured and sent to Carloman. In 871, he managed to capture Svatopluk, thus establishing direct control over the entire principality, but soon decided to reinstall him, in order to pacify the country. That proved to be disastrous, since Svatopluk, as soon as reaching Moravia, turned against Carloman, inflicting severe losses on Frankish army. In 873, after several interventions of Pope John VIII, including those made to Carloman, a peace settlement was reached in Forchheim, between king Louis and envoys of Svatopluk, thus concluding the state of war on eastern borders. Division of Frankfurt In order to prevent future dynastic conflicts, king Louis decided to regulate the position of his three sons within the government. In 865, an arrangement on the future succession was reached and promulgated in Frankfurt, thus becoming known as the Division of Frankfurt. Bavaria and southeastern marches were designated to Carloman, Saxony and Franconia to Louis the Younger, and Alamannia to Charles the Fat. Princes were to become rulers of designated domains only upon their father‚Ä≤s death. Non of them was given the title of a king during his father's lifetime, but their position withing the state affairs was regulated in detail, with king Louis keeping all of the main prerogatives of royal power. I the same time, all of king‚Ä≤s sons married into the local aristocracy of the regions marked out for them. Carloman married the daughter of a Bavarian military leader (dux) named Ernest, whom the Annales Bertiniani describe as \\"the greatest of all the king's great men\\". This marriage must have taken place before Ernest's disgrace and dismissal in 861, for Louis the German strongly disapproved of his second son's seeking a marriage with family that had likewise been disgraced in 858‚Äì59. By the 870s, according to the Annales Bertiniani, at the time being composed by Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, Carloman's mother, Emma, was encouraging her husband to favour Carloman over his brothers. This is the first recorded involvement of Emma in politics, and it may relate to Louis's illness during 869‚Äì70. On the other hand, historian Ernst D√ºmmler thought Carloman must have been a \\"mamma's boy\\" (Mutters√∂hnchen). Ruler of Italy An original charter in which Carloman confirms the Abbey of Nonantola in its possession of the rural baptistery (pieve) in Lizzano On 12 August 875, Louis II of Italy died and his kingdom was claimed by Louis the German for his sons Carloman and Charles and by Charles the Bald. Pope John VIII, dealing with the constant threat of raiders from Muslim Sicily, sided with Charles the Bald. Carloman led an army into Italy, where he granted a diploma to the monastery of San Clemente a Casauria, one of Louis II's most favored houses. In the diploma Carloman declared himself Louis's chosen successor. According to the Annales Fuldenses, Charles had to offer him \\"a huge sum in gold and silver and precious stones\\" to get him to leave Italy. On 28 August 876, Louis died and his sons became kings in their allotted kingdoms. On 6 October 877, Charles the Bald died and later that month Carloman succeeded in having himself elected King of Italy by the nobles assembled in Pavia. The lure of Italy was \\"the looting which was apparently acceptable when a king first took over a kingdom\\", providing rewards that could be shared out among followers and more than offset the cost of raising an army and crossing the Alps. Carloman was one of only two Carolingian kings of Italy‚Äîhis brother and successor Charles being the other‚Äîwho did not issue a capitulary at the beginning of his reign in order to proclaim his legitimacy and affirm his keeping to traditions of good government. In Italy, Carloman confirmed his predecessor's act that made bishops permanent missi dominici (royal representatives) in their dioceses. He added to the new regulation by expanding the jurisdiction of individual bishops to gain their loyalty. His grant to Bishop Wibod of Parma of the districtio, or temporal authority in the district outside the city walls, was the first grant of its kind to a bishop. By the time of Carloman's death, the confirmation of a predecessor's concessions to the episcopate and the negotiating of new ones in exchange for support had become an Italian tradition. In 876, Charles had granted Pope John jurisdictional rights in the duchies of Spoleto and Camerino. After his succession, Carloman supported the dukes, Lambert I and Guy III, who had always claimed the rights as royal representatives which Charles had offered the pope. In 879, Carloman donated land to the monastery of Santa Cristina by the royal palace at Olona. Although the monastery was reportedly built during the eighth century, the first record of its dedication to Cristina is found in Carloman's charter. In a letter of 7 June 879, Pope John, having failed to convince Louis the Stammerer, Charles the Bald's heir, to come to Italy for its defence, appealed to Carloman, whom he had previously rejected. It was too late; by then Carloman was incapacitated. Shortly before his abdication, he granted a complex of estates around Olona to the church of San Sisto, which had been founded by Queen Engelberga in Piacenza. In Italy, Carloman had denarii (pennies) minted at Milan and Pavia. Those minted at Milan generally bore the inscription CARLOMAN REX, while those of Pavia bore HCARLEMANNVS RE. All had a stylised temple on one side. Carloman did not issue coinage in Bavaria. Ruler of Bavaria Carolingian empire in 876, with Bavaria in blue In Bavaria, Carloman re- founded the palace and monastery at √ñtting. He dedicated it to the Virgin Mary and \\"numerous other saints whose relics we were able to collect with God's help\\". He appointed his father's friend, the linguistic scholar Baldo, as his chancellor. In 878, he may have been the object of an assassination attempt. According to the Annales Iuvavenses, the king \\"was surrounded by Count Ermenpert and some of his soldiers\\" at Ergolding, but the count apparently fled to West Francia, where he was received by Louis the Stammerer.MGH, Scriptores, 30, p. 742: DCCCLXXVIII. Karlomannus rex circumseptus ad Ergoltinga ab Ermenperto comite et ceteris sodalibus suis. Ermpertus in Franciam receptus a Ludowico. DCCCLXXX. Karlomannus rex obiit X kal. October. Carloman groomed his illegitimate son Arnulf for the succession in Bavaria. In a charter issued at Regensburg, he called him \\"regal son\\" (filius regalis), a term similar to \\"the king's son\\" (filius regis), which was the standard title of a legitimate royal son. This policy had supporters, like Abbot Regino of Pr√ºm and the monks of Saint Gall, but also detractors, who appealed to Carloman's brother Louis. In early 879, Carloman was incapacitated by illness, perhaps a stroke. Louis came to Bavaria to receive the recognition of the aristocracy as future king. By Easter he had left, and Arnulf took control of the kingdom in his father's name. He dismissed some prominent counts, who appealed to Louis to restore them. Carloman tried to legitimise Arnulf's actions by adding his son's name to the prayer provisions of his charters, but in November Louis came to Bavaria to force a resolution of the succession. He restored the deposed counts and Carloman formally abdicated his Bavarian throne to his brother. He also placed Arnulf under Louis's protection. His brother Charles dated his reign in Italy from November 879, so presumably Carloman abdicated that kingdom at the same time as Bavaria. Illness and death Regarding Carloman's condition, the Annales Fuldenses (879) record that he lost his voice, but was still able to communicate by writing. Regino of Pr√ºm, writing in his chronicle for the year 880, recalls that he was \\"erudite in letters\\" (litteris eruditus), which meant he could write Latin. Regino's entire encomium on Carloman goes: > That most excellent king was learned in letters, devoted to the Christian > religion, just, peaceful, and morally upright. The beauty of his body was > exceptional, and his physical strength was a wonder to behold. He possessed > a very warlike spirit. He waged numerous wars against the Slavic kingdoms > with his father, and even more without him. He always returned the victor in > triumph and expanded the borders of his empire with glorious iron. He was > mild to his own men and a living terror to his enemies. He was charming in > speech, humble, and endowed with great cleverness for managing the business > of the realm. He was so skilled that he was the very embodiment of royal > majesty. Most sources place Carloman's death in March 880, but the Annales Iuvavenses place it on 21 September. He was buried in the chapel of his palace at √ñtting. Carloman left one illegitimate son, Arnulf, who continued as margrave of Carinthia during the reigns of Carloman's brothers, but in 887 became king of East Francia and in 896 emperor.

Background Literally translated, chind≈çgu means . The term was coined by Kenji Kawakami, a former editor and contributor to the Japanese home-shopping magazine \\"Mail Order Life.\\" In the magazine, Kenji used his spare pages to showcase several bizarre prototypes for products. He named these gadgets ‚Äúchind≈çgu‚Äù; Kawakami himself said that a more appropriate translation than \\"unusual tool\\" is \\"weird tool\\". This special category of inventions subsequently became familiar to the Japanese people. Dan Papia then introduced it to the English-speaking world and popularized it as a monthly feature in his magazine, Tokyo Journal, encouraging readers to send in ideas. In 1995, Kawakami and Papia collaborated on the English language book 101 Unuseless Japanese Inventions: The Art of Chind≈çgu. Most classic chindogu products are collected in the book. Many examples display a sense of humor in the way they are used. Examples from the books include: * A combined household duster and cocktail-shaker, for the housewife who wants to reward herself as she is going along. * The all-day tissue dispenser, which is a toilet roll fixed on top of a hat, for hay fever sufferers. * Duster slippers for cats, so they can help out with the housework. * The all-over plastic bathing suit, to enable people who suffer from aquaphobia to swim without coming into contact with water. * The baby mop, an outfit worn by babies, so that as they crawl around, the floor is cleaned. * The selfie stick, which was featured in a 1995 book of \\"101 Un- Useless Japanese Inventions\\". While dismissed as a \\"useless invention\\" at the time, it later gained global popularity in the 21st century. The International Chindogu Society The International Chindogu Society was organized to popularize Chindogu worldwide. The society's president Dan Papia is also a Chindogu expert. People who invent a Chindogu can post their success on the society's website, which features frequently asked questions and a contact page, so anyone can get involved. At the moment, the society is small, but they are always looking for new members. The society's \\"Ten Tenets of Chindogu\\" are also listed on their website. The Ten Tenets of Chind≈çgu The Chind≈çgu Society developed ten tenets of Chind≈çgu. The tenets function explain the principles (spirits) on which chindogu products should be based, which inspires designers and users to think about the deep core of design in general. The ten tenets require that a Chind≈çgu * cannot be for real use, * must exist, * must be a spirit of anarchy, * is a tool for everyday life, * is not a tradeable commodities, * must have resulted only from an exercise of humor, * is not propaganda, * is not taboo, * cannot be patented, and * is without prejudice. In the media Chind≈çgu and its creator Kenji Kawakami were featured regularly on a children's television show produced by the BBC called It'll Never Work?, a show in a similar vein as the BBC's Tomorrow's World; however, It'll Never Work usually focused more on wacky, humorous gadgets than on serious scientific and technological advances.

In 1849 he took part in the May Uprising in Dresden and was put on the government's wanted list. Semper fled first to Z√ºrich and later to London. Later he returned to Germany after the 1862 amnesty granted to the revolutionaries. Semper wrote extensively about the origins of architecture, especially in his book The Four Elements of Architecture from 1851, and he was one of the major figures in the controversy surrounding the polychrome architectural style of ancient Greece. Semper designed works at all scales, from major urban interventions like the re- design of the Ringstra√üe in Vienna, to a baton for Richard Wagner.Dorothea Schr√∂der: \\"Nibelungenring und mystischer Knoten. Gottfried Sempers Entwurf zu einem Taktstock f√ºr Richard Wagner\\" Jahrbuch des Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg,1993, P.120 His unrealised design for an opera house in Munich was, without permission, adapted by Wagner for the Bayreuth Festspielhaus.  Life  = Early life (to 1834) = Semper was born into a well-to-do industrialist family in Altona. The fifth of eight children, he attended the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg before starting his university education at G√∂ttingen in 1823, where he studied historiography and mathematics. He subsequently studied architecture in 1825 at the University of Munich under Friedrich von G√§rtner. In 1826, Semper travelled to Paris in order to work for the architect Franz Christian Gau, and he was present when the July Revolution of 1830 broke out. Between 1830 and 1833 he travelled to Italy and Greece in order to study the architecture and designs of antiquity. In 1832, he participated for four months in archaeological research at the Acropolis in Athens. During this period he became very interested in the Biedermeier-inspired polychromy debate, which centered on the question whether buildings in Ancient Greece and Rome had been colorfully painted or not. The drawn reconstructions of the painterly decorations of ancient villas he created in Athens inspired his later designs for the painted decorations in Dresden and Vienna. His 1834 publication Vorl√§ufige Bemerkungen √ºber bemalte Architectur und Plastik bei den Alten (Preliminary Remarks on Polychrome Architecture and Sculpture in Antiquity), in which he took a strong position in favor of polychromy - supported by his investigation of pigments on the Trajan's column in Rome - brought him sudden recognition in architectural and aesthetic circles across Europe . = Dresden period (1834‚Äì1849) = Dresden, Interior of the first Hoftheater (Semper Oper) On September 30, 1834, Semper obtained a post as Professor of Architecture at the K√∂niglichen Akademie der bildenden K√ºnste (today called the Hochschule) in Dresden thanks largely to the efforts and support of his former teacher Franz Christian Gau and swore an oath of allegiance to the King (formerly Elector) of Saxony, Anthony Clement. The flourishing growth of Dresden during this period provided the young architect with considerable creative opportunities. In 1838-40 a synagogue was built in Dresden to Semper's design, it was ever afterward called the Semper Synagogue and is noted for its Moorish Revival interior style.H.A. Meek, The Synagogue, Phaidon, 1995, p. 188 The Synagogue's exterior was built in romanesque style so as not to call attention to itself. The interior design included not only the Moorish inspired wall decorations but furnishings: specifically, a silver lamp of eternal light, which caught Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima's fancy. They gave a great deal of effort to have a copy of this lamp.Colin Eisler \\"Wagner's Three Synagogues\\", Artibus et Historiae 2004, Vol. 25/Nr. 50Eytan Pessen, Zusammenh√§ngende Reliquien, eine Geschichte √ºber Richard Wagner und Gottfried Semper, pp. 1-22, Semperoper Dresden, Erchien in Wagnerjahr 2013, Spielzeit 2012-2013 & 2013-2014 Semper's student, Otto Simonson would construct the magnificent Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue in 1855. Monument for Gottfried Semper (1887) Certain civic structures remain today, such as the Elbe-facing gallery of the Zwinger Palace complex. His first building for the Dresden Hoftheater burnt down, and the second, today called the Semperoper, was built in 1841. Other buildings also remain indelibly attached to his name, such as the Maternity Hospital, the Synagogue (destroyed during the Third Reich), the Oppenheim Palace, and the Villa Rosa built for the banker Martin Wilhelm Oppenheim. This last construction stands as a prototype of German villa architecture. On September 1, 1835, Semper married Bertha Thimmig. The marriage ultimately produced six children. A convinced Republican, Semper took a leading role, along with his friend Richard Wagner, in the May 1849 uprising which swept over the city. He was a member of the Civic Guard (Kommunalgarde) and helped to erect barricades in the streets. When the rebellion collapsed, Semper was considered a leading agitator for democratic change and a ringleader against government authority and he was forced to flee the city. He was destined never to return to the city that would, ironically, become most associated with his architectural (and political) legacy. The Saxon government maintained a warrant for his arrest until 1863. When the Semper-designed Hoftheater burnt down in 1869, King John, on the urging of the citizenry, commissioned Semper to build a new one. Semper produced the plans but left the actual construction to his son, Manfred. \\"What must I have done in 48, that one persecutes me forever? One single barricade did I construct - it held, because it was practical, and as it was practical, it was beautiful\\", wrote Semper in dismay.Letter to Heinrich H√ºbsch, January 1852 = Post-revolutionary period (1849‚Äì1855) = After stays in Zwickau, Hof, Karlsruhe and Strasbourg, Semper eventually ended up back in Paris, like many other disillusioned Republicans from the 1848 Revolutions (such as Heinrich Heine and Ludwig B√∂rne). In the fall of 1850, he travelled to London, England. But while he was able to pick up occasional contracts ‚Äî including participation in the design of the funeral carriage for the Duke of Wellington and the designs of the Canadian, Danish, Swedish, and Ottoman sections of the 1851 Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace ‚Äî he found no steady employment. If his stay in London was disappointing professionally, however, it proved a fertile period for Semper's theoretical, creative and academic development. He published Die vier Elemente der Baukunst (The Four Elements of Architecture) in 1851 and Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst (Science, Industry and Art) in 1852. These works would ultimately provide the groundwork for his most widely regarded publication, Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen K√ºnsten oder Praktische √Ñsthetik, which was published in two volumes in 1861 and 1863. = Z√ºrich period (1855‚Äì1871) = Gottfried Semper Polytechnikum in 1865 ETH Zurich Hauptgeb√§ude (main building) Stadthaus (city hall) Winterthur Concurrently with the onset of the industrial revolution, the Swiss Federation planned to establish a polytechnical school. As the principal judge for the competition held to select a design for the new building, Semper deemed the submitted entries unsatisfactory and, ultimately, designed the building himself. Proudly situated (where fortified walls once stood), visible from all sides on a terrace overlooking the core of Zurich, the new school became a symbol of a new epoch. The building (1853‚Äì1864), which despite frequent remodeling continues to evoke Semper's concept, was initially required to accommodate not only the new school (known today as the ETH Zurich), but the existing University of Zurich, as well. In 1855, Semper became a professor of architecture at the new school and the success of many of his students who attained success and renown served to ensure his legacy. The Swiss architect Emil Schmid was one such student. With his income as a professor, Semper was able to reunite his family, bringing them to Zurich from Saxony. The City Hall in Winterthur is among other buildings designed by Semper in Switzerland. Semper provided Bavaria's King Ludwig II with a conceptual design for a theatre dedicated to the work of Richard Wagner to be built in Munich. The project, developed from 1864 to 1866, was never realized, although Wagner 'borrowed' many of its features for his own later theatre at Bayreuth. = Later life (from 1871) = Semper's grave in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome Franz von Lenbach's portrait of Gottfried Semper shortly before his death Already in 1833, there were first plans in Vienna for the public presentation of the Imperial Art Collections. With the planning of the Vienna Ring Road, the museum question became pressing again. Works forming the imperial art collection were scattered among several buildings. Semper was assigned to submit a proposal for locating new buildings in conjunction with redevelopment of the Ring Road. In 1869, he designed a gigantic 'Imperial Forum' which was not realized. The National Museum of Art History and the National Museum of Natural History were erected, however, opposite the Palace according to his plan, as was the Burgtheater. In 1871, Semper moved to Vienna to undertake the projects. During construction, repeated disagreements with his appointed associate architect (Karl Freiherr von Hasenauer), led Semper to resign from the project in 1876. In the following year, his health began to deteriorate. He died two years later while on a visit to Italy and is buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome.

He succeeded his father, king Arnulf of Carinthia in 899, when he was six and reigned until his death aged 17 or 18. Louis also inherited the crown of Lotharingia with the death of his elder illegitimate half-brother Zwentibold in 900. During his reign the country was ravaged by Magyar raids. Life Louis was born in September or October 893 in Alt√∂tting, Duchy of Bavaria. He was the only legitimate son of king Arnulf of Carinthia and his wife, Ota, a member of the Conradine dynasty. He had at least two brothers: his elder, illegitimate brother Zwentibold, who ruled Lotharingia, and another brother named Ratold, who briefly ruled Kingdom of Italy. Ratold's maternity and age are unknown. Louis was crowned in Forchheim on 4 February 900. This is the earliest East Frankish royal coronation about which records are known to exist. Louis was of a weak personal constitution, often sick, and due to his young age, the reins of government were entirely in the hands of others - the nobles and bishops. Indeed, the coronation was probably a result of the fact that there was little Louis could gain at the expense of the nobles. The most influential of Louis's councillors were Hatto I and Solomon III (bishop of Constance). It was these two who assured that the royal court decided in favour of the Conradines against the Babenbergers in the matter of the Duchy of Franconia. They appointed Louis's nephew, Conrad as a duke. In 903 the Raffelstetten Customs Regulations were promulgated under Louis' reign, the first customs regulations in the East Frankish part of Europe. In 900, during the Hungarian invasions of Europe, the Magyar army ravaged Bavaria. Another group of Magyars were defeated by Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria and Bishop Richer of Passau. In 901 they devastated the Duchy of Carinthia. In 904 Louis invited Kursz√°n, the kende of the Magyars, to negotiations, but killed him and his delegation. In 906 Magyars twice ravaged the Duchy of Saxony. In 907 they inflicted a heavy defeat on the Bavarians who had invaded Hungary, killing the Margrave Luitpold and many high nobles in the Battle of Pressburg. Next year it was the turn of Saxony and Thuringia, and in 909 that of Alemannia. On their return, however, Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria inflicted a defeat on them on the river Rott, but in 910 they, in their turn, defeated Louis the Child's army in the Battle of Augsburg.Gwatking, H. M., Whitney, J. P., et al. Cambridge Medieval History: Volume III‚ÄîGermany and the Western Empire. Louis himself tried to take some military control as he grew older, but he had little success against the Magyars. His army was destroyed at Ennsburg in 907. In a state of despair, possibly afflicted by severe depression, Louis died at Frankfurt am Main on 20 or 24 September 911, seventeen or eighteen years old. Louis was buried in the monastery of Saint Emmeram in Regensburg, where his father Arnulf of Carinthia lay. His death brought an end to the eastern (German) branch of the Carolingian dynasty. The vacuum left in the Carolingian East was eventually filled in 919 by the family of Henry the Fowler, a cousin, and heralded the beginning of the Ottonian dynasty. However, in 911 the dukes of East Francia elected Conrad of Franconia as the king of East Francia, while the nobles of Lotharingia elected as their king Charles the Simple, king of West Francia. In popular culture In an interview with the Daily Trojan, one member of the EDM duo Louis the Child said, \\"We went on Wikipedia and hit the random article button a couple of times, then Louis The Child popped up and we thought, 'Yeah, that sounds good' and we went with it.\\" See also *Kings of Germany family tree *List of Frankish kings Notes External links * Category:893 births Category:911 deaths Category:9th-century kings of East Francia Category:10th century kings of East Francia Category:9th-century rulers of Bavaria Category:10th-century rulers of Bavaria Category:People from Alt√∂tting Category:Kings of Bavaria Category:Kings of Saxony Category:Kings of Lotharingia Category:Medieval child rulers Category:Burials at St. Emmeram's Abbey ","title":"Louis the Child"},{"id":"76264","text":"Winamp is a media player for Microsoft Windows originally developed by Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev by their company Nullsoft, which they later sold to AOL in 1999 for $80 million. It was then acquired by Radionomy in 2014. Since version 2 it has been sold as freemium and supports extensibility with plug-ins and skins, and features music visualization, playlist and a media library, supported by a large online community. Version 1 of Winamp was released in 1997, and grew quickly popular with over 3 million downloads, paralleling the developing trend of MP3 (music) file sharing. Winamp 2.0 was released on September 8, 1998. The 2.x versions were widely used and made Winamp one of the most downloaded Windows applications. By 2000, Winamp had over 25 million registered users and by 2001 it had 60 million users. A poor reception to the 2002 rewrite, Winamp3, was followed by the release of Winamp 5 in 2003, and a later release of version 5.5 in 2007. A now-discontinued version for Android was also released, along with early counterparts for DOS and Macintosh. Winamp 5.8 (written as Winamp 5.\\\\infin) was leaked to general public in 2018. The Radionomy team decided to release the version themselves to maintain security levels. Radionomy later announced their intention to eventually release Winamp 6.  Features  ; Playback formats: Winamp supports music playback using MP3, MIDI, MOD, MPEG-1 audio layers 1 and 2, AAC, M4A, FLAC, WAV, and WMA. Winamp was one of the first widely used music players on Windows to support playback of Ogg Vorbis by default. It supports gapless playback for MP3 and AAC and ReplayGain for volume leveling across tracks. CD support includes playing and importing music from audio CDs, optionally with CD-Text, and burning music to CDs. The standard version limits maximum burn speed and datarate; the \\"Pro\\" version removes these limitations. Winamp supports playback of Windows Media Video and Nullsoft Streaming Video. For MPEG Video, AVI, and other unsupported video types, Winamp uses Microsoft's DirectShow API for playback, allowing playback of most of the video formats supported by Windows Media Player. 5.1 Surround sound is supported where formats and decoders allow. ; Media Library: At installation, Winamp scans the user's system for media files to add to the Media Library database. It supports full Unicode filenames and Unicode metadata for media files. In the Media Library user interface pane, under Local Media, several selectors (Audio, Video, date, and frequency) permit display of subsets of media files with greater detail. ; Adding album art and track tags: Get Album Art permits retrieval of cover art, and confirmation before adding the image to the database. Autotagging analyzes a track's audio using the Gracenote service and retrieves the song's ID2 and ID3 metadata. ; Podcatcher: Winamp can also be used as an RSS media feeds aggregator capable of displaying articles, downloading, or playing such content as streaming media. SHOUTcast Wire provides a directory and RSS subscription system for podcasts. ; Media player device support: Winamp has extendable support for portable media players and Mass Storage Compliant devices, Microsoft PlaysForSure, and ActiveSync, and syncs unprotected music to the iPod. ; Media Monitor: Winamp Media Monitor allows web-based browsing and bookmarking music blog websites and automatically offering for streaming or downloading all MP3 files there. The Media Monitor is preloaded with music blog URLs. ; Winamp Remote: Winamp Remote allows remote playback (streaming) of unprotected media files on the user's PC via the Internet. Remote adjusts bitrate based on available bandwidth, and can be controlled by web interface, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and mobile phones. ; Plug-ins: In February 1998, Winamp was rewritten as a \\"general-purpose audio player\\" with a plug-in architecture. This feature was received well by reviewers. Development was early, diverse, and rapid: 66 plugins were published by November 1998. The Winamp software development kit (SDK) allows software developers to create seven different types of plug-ins. :*Input: decodes specific file formats. :*Output: sends data to specific devices or files. :*Visualization: provides sound activated graphics. :*DSP/Effect: manipulates audio for special effects. :*General Purpose plug- ins add convenience or UI features (Media Library, alarm clock, or pause when logged out). :*Media Library plug-ins add functions to the Media Library plug- in. :*Portables plug-ins support portable media players. MilkDrop, a visualization plug-in in Winamp :Plug-in development support increased Winamp's flexibility for, for example, a plethora of specialized plug-ins for game console music files such as NSF, USF, GBS, GSF, SID, VGM, SPC, PSF, and PSF2. ; Skins: Skins are bitmap files which alter the aesthetic design of the Winamp graphical user interface (GUI) and can add functionality with scripting. Winamp published documentation on skin creation in 1998 with the release of Winamp 2 and invited Winamp users to publish skins on Winamp.com. As of 2000 there were nearly 3,000 Winamp skins available. The ability to use skins contributed to Winamp's popularity early in MP3 development. With the increasing number of available skins, genres or categories of skins developed, such as \\"Stereo\\", \\"Anime\\", and \\"Ugly\\". Online communities of skin designers such as 1001Skins.com and Skinz.org have contributed thousands of designs; also at GnomeArt. Designers see skins as an opportunity to be creative: nontraditional examples have included Klingon, iPod, and Etch-a-sketch designs. The Winamp skin format is the most popular, the most commonly adopted by other media player software, and is usable across platforms. One example is the XMMS player for Linux and Unix systems, which can use unmodified Winamp 2 skin files. Winamp 5 supports two types of skins ‚Äì \\"classic\\" skins designed to Winamp 2 specifications (static collections of bitmap images), and more flexible, freeform \\"modern\\" skins per the Winamp3 specification. Modern skins support true alpha channel transparency, scripting control, a docked toolbar, and other innovations to the user interface.  History  = Initial releases = WinAMP 0.2a WinAMP 0.92 Winamp was first released in 1997, when Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev, formerly students at the University of Utah, integrated their Windows user interface with the Advanced Multimedia Products (\\"AMP\\") MP3 file playback engine. The name Winamp (originally spelled WinAMP) was a portmanteau of \\"Windows\\" and \\"AMP\\". The minimalist WinAMP 0.20a was released as freeware on April 21, 1997. Its windowless, menu bar-only interface showed only play (open), stop, pause, and unpause functions. A file specified on the command line or dropped onto its icon would be played. MP3 decoding was performed by the AMP decoding engine developed by Advanced Multimedia Products co-founder Tomislav Uzelac, which was free for non- commercial use. It was compatible with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. Winamp was the second real-time MP3 player for Windows, the first being WinPlay3.https://www.silicon.co.uk/mobility/mobile-apps/tales-tech-history- winamp-220495 WinAMP 0.92 was released as a freeware in May 1997. Within the standard Windows frame and menu bar, it had the beginnings of the \\"classic\\" Winamp GUI: dark gray rectangle with silver 3D-effect transport buttons, a red/green volume slider, time displayed in a green LED font, with track name, MP3 bitrate, and \\"mixrate\\" in green. There was no position bar, and a blank space where the spectrum analyzer and waveform analyzer would later appear. Multiple files on the command line or dropped onto its icon were enqueued in the playlist. = Winamp 1 = Winamp 1 Version 1.006 was released June 7, 1997, renamed \\"Winamp\\", i.e., with \\"amp\\" now in lowercase. It showed a spectrum analyzer and color-changing volume slider, but no waveform display. The AMP non-commercial license was included in its help menu. According to Tomislav Uzelac, Frankel licensed the AMP 0.7 engine June 1, 1997. Frankel formally founded Nullsoft Inc. in January 1998 and continued development of Winamp, which changed from freeware to $10 shareware. Despite the fact that there would be no extra features by paying $10, Winamp's popularity and warm reception brought Nullsoft $100,000 a month that year from $10 paper checks in the mail from paying users. In March, Brian Litman, managing co-founder with Uzelac of Advanced Multimedia Products, which by then had been merged into PlayMedia Systems, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Nullsoft, claiming unlawful use of AMP. Nullsoft responded that they had replaced AMP with Nitrane, Nullsoft's proprietary decoder, but Playmedia disputed this. Third- party reviews found that Nitrane had bugs that resulted in playing back MP3s incorrectly, and that this resulted in unstable tones being added to the playback, and undoubtedly therefore violated the ISO standard. This also means that Nitrane was unlikely to have been based on the AMP software, and was more likely evidence of a hastily written MP3 decoder that didn't concern itself with standards compliance. Version 1.90, released March 31, 1998, was the first release as a general-purpose audio player, and documented on the Winamp website as supporting plugins, of which it included two input plugins (MOD and MP3) and a visualization plugin. The installer for Version 1.91, released 18 days later, included wave, cdda, and Windows tray handling plugins, as well as the famous Wesley Willis-inspired DEMO.MP3 file \\"Winamp, it really whips the llama's ass\\". By July 1998, Winamp's various versions had been downloaded over three million times. = Winamp 2 = Winamp 2, shown with default Base Skin Winamp 2.0 was released on September 8, 1998. The new version improved the usability of the playlist, made the equalizer more accurate, and introduced more plug-ins. The playlist and equalizer windows now matched the player's skin and could be moved around and \\"docked\\" anywhere. The 2.x versions were widely used and made Winamp one of the most downloaded pieces of software for Windows. By the end of 1998, there were already over 60 plugins and hundreds of skins made for the software.https://web.archive.org/web/19981203055250/http://www.winamp.com/winamp/overview.html PlayMedia filed a federal lawsuit against Nullsoft in March 1999. In May 1999, PlayMedia was granted an injunction by Federal Judge A. Howard Matz against distribution of Nitrane by Nullsoft, and the same month the lawsuit was settled out-of-court with licensing and confidentiality agreements. Soon after, Nullsoft switched to an ISO decoder from the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the developers of the MP3 format. Winamp 2.10, released March 24, 1999, included a new version of the \\"Llama\\" demo.mp3 featuring a musical sting and bleating. Nullsoft was purchased by AOL in June 1999 for $80 million in stock, with Nullsoft becoming a subsidiary. AOL itself merged with Time Warner in 2000. Nullsoft relaunched the Winamp-specific winamp.com in December 1999 to provide easier access to skins, plug-ins, streaming audio, song downloads, forums, and developer resources. As of June 22, 2000, Winamp surpassed 25 million registrants. = Winamp3 = The next major Winamp version, Winamp3 (so spelled to include mp3 in the name and to mark its separation from the Winamp 2 codebase), was released on August 9, 2002. It was a complete rewrite of version 2, newly based on the Wasabi application framework, which offered additional functionality and flexibility. Winamp3 was developed parallel to Winamp 2, but \\"many users found it consumed too many system resources and was unstable (or even lacked some valued functionality, such as the ability to count or find the total duration of tracks in a playlist)\\". Winamp3 had no backward compatibility with Winamp 2 plugins, and the SHOUTcast sourcing plugin was not supported. No Winamp3 version of SHOUTcast was ever released. In response to users reverting to Winamp 2, Nullsoft continued the development of Winamp 2 to versions 2.9 and 2.91 in 2003, even alluding to it humorously. The beta versions 2.92 and 2.95 were released with the inclusion of some of the functionality of the upcoming Winamp 5. During this period the Wasabi cross-platform application framework and skinnable GUI toolkit was derived from parts of the Winamp3 source code. For Linux, Nullsoft released an alpha version of Winamp3 on October 9, 2001, but has not updated it despite continued user interest. During this time Winamp faced stiff competition from Apple's iTunes. = Winamp 5 = Winamp 5 featuring Winamp Modern skin Winamp 5 with the Classic skin, showing the player and docked equalizer and playlist Winamp 5 was based on the Winamp 2 codebase, but with Winamp3 features such as modern skins incorporated via a plugin, (forum post by developer) thus incorporating the main advantages of both products. Regarding the omission of a version 4, Nullsoft joked that \\"nobody wants to see a Winamp 4 skin\\" (\\"4 skin\\" being a pun on foreskin). It was also joked that \\"Winamp 5 is so good they skipped a number\\" and \\"Winamp 2+3=5,\\". Winamp 5.0 was released in December 2003. A blue themed \\"Modern\\" skin became the default interface. The media library was improved, CD burning and ripping was introduced, and other additions. The original Nullsoft team quit in 2004. As of version 5.1, Winamp development is credited to Ben Allison (Benski) and Maksim Tyrtyshny. From version 5.2 onwards, support for synchronizing with an iPod is built-in.  Winamp 5.5  Winamp 5.5: The 10th Anniversary Edition was released on October 10, 2007, ten years after the first release of Winamp (a preview version had been released on September 10, 2007). New features to the player included album art support, improved localization support (with several officially localized Winamp releases, including German, Polish, Russian, and French), and a new default interface skin called \\"Bento\\" which unlike the previous skins is a unified player and media library in one window as opposed to a multi-window interface.http://www.last100.com/2007/09/17/winamp-goes- where-itunes-doesnt-dare/ This version dropped support for Windows 9x.  Winamp 5.6  Winamp 5.621, when listening to the SHOUTcast stream Winamp 5.6 was released in November 2010https://winfuture.de/news,59877.html and features Android Wi-Fi support and direct mouse wheel support. Fraunhofer AAC codec with VBR encoding support was implemented. Moreover, the option to write ratings to tags (for MP3, WMA/WMV, Ogg, and FLAC) was added. Hungarian and Indonesian installer translations and language packs were added. With the release of Winamp version 5.66 on November 20, 2013, AOL announced that Winamp.com would shut down on December 20, 2013, and Winamp would cease to be offered for download after that date. Five days later, version 5.666 was released with the \\"Pro\\" and \\"Full\\" installers being one and the same, in the process removing OpenCandy, Emusic, AOL Search, and AOL Toolbar from the installation bundle. This was announced to be the last release of Winamp from AOL/Nullsoft.  Winamp 5.7  There was a Winamp 5.7 beta program for an invitation-based Winamp Cloud feature, which would let Winamp play a user's entire cloud-stored music library across all supported devices. This feature would have allowed AOL to provide a music locker service that would essentially compete with other online music lockers. The beta program was cancelled months before the announcement to shut down the Winamp project. = Acquisition by Radionomy = On November 20, 2013, AOL announced that on December 20, 2013, it would shut down Winamp.com, and the software would no longer be available for download, nor supported by the company after that date. The following day, an unofficial report surfaced that Microsoft was in talks with AOL to acquire Nullsoft. Despite AOL's announcement, the Winamp site was not shut down as planned, and on January 14, 2014, it was officially announced that Belgian online radio aggregator Radionomy had bought the Nullsoft brand, which includes Winamp and SHOUTcast. No financial details were publicly announced. However, TechCrunch has reported that the sale of Winamp and Shoutcast is worth between $5 and $10 million, with AOL taking a 12% stake (a financial, not strategic, investment) in Radionomy in the process. Radionomy relaunched the Winamp website and it was available for download again. Despite the website claiming that Winamp will be returning soon, no new stable version has been developed since version 5.666 from November 2013. In December 2015, Vivendi bought a majority stake in Radionomy. The first official version of Winamp since Radionomy's acquisition is version 5.8.  Winamp 5.8  It was reported that Winamp 5.8 beta has been leaked to the web despite that the release date of the build was on October 26, 2016. The leaked build is the first Winamp beta released under Radionomy's umbrella. There are many improvements and changes of the leaked build, including full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 8.1. This version also replaced functions originally locked behind Winamp Pro with free alternatives. Following the leak, Radionomy decided to officially release a revised Winamp 5.8 on October 18, 2018. The newer update of Winamp 5.8 has a build number of 3660, compared to the October 2016 version's build number of 3563. = Winamp 6 = On October 15, 2018, Radionomy's CEO, Alexandre Saboundjian announced that a new version of Winamp ‚Äì Winamp 6 ‚Äì would be released in 2019. As of July 2020, there has been no release or further details about what this new version of Winamp will look like, including which services Winamp would support or how the new version of the app would integrate with newer music platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify.  On other platforms  = Android = Winamp for Android streaming an Internet radio station over WiFi Winamp for Android is a mobile version for the Android (version 2.1) operating system, released in beta in October 2010 with a stable release in December 2010. It includes syncing with Winamp desktop (ver. 5.59 beta+) over USB or WiFi. It was received with some enthusiasm in the consumer blog press. The app was removed from the Play Store in 2014. It was reported by TechCrunch that a redesigned Android app was planned alongside the announcement of the development of Winamp 6. =Macintosh= In 1997 Nullsoft also released MacAmp, an Apple Macintosh equivalent of Winamp. In October 2011, Winamp Sync for Mac was introduced as a beta release. It is the first Winamp version for the Mac OS X platform and runs under version 10.6 and above. Its focus is on syncing the Winamp Library to Winamp for Android and the iTunes Music Library (hence the name, \\"Winamp Sync for Mac\\"). Nonetheless, a full Winamp Library and player features are included. The developer's blog stated that the Winamp Sync for Mac Beta would pave the way for future Winamp-related development on Mac and a fully featured media player as Winamp on Windows.https://www.pawelporwisz.pl/winamp/winamp_help_mac.php However no further development occurred. =Linux= Winamp 5 running on Linux using WINE An early alpha preview of Winamp3 for desktop Linux was developed in October 2001,https://web.archive.org/web/20011107175804/http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2001/winamp3beta.html but the project was not pursued. Nonetheless some versions of Winamp for Windows are functional using WINE. =DOS= DOSamp for DOS operating systems was released in 1997. The software was soon abandoned by Nullsoft to focus on the Windows version (Winamp).  Easter eggs  Winamp has historically included a number of Easter eggs: hidden features that are accessible via undocumented operations. One example is an image of Justin Frankel, one of Winamp's original authors, hidden in Winamp's About dialog box. The included Easter eggs have changed with versions of Winamp, and over thirty have been documented elsewhere.  Derivative works  Unagi is the codename for the media playback engine derived from Winamp core technologies. AOL announced in 2004 that Unagi would be incorporated into AOL Media Player (AMP), in development. After beta testing, AMP was discontinued in 2005, but portions lived on in AOL's Web-based player.
